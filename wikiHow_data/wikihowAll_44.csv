Obtain the right scissors and comb.,
Distract the toddler.,
Wet down the hair.",How to Cut a Toddler's Hair1," You don’t want to wing it when cutting toddler’s hair because the toddler might be squirmy. Get your tools ready. The most important tool: Good scissors.


A pair of barber’s scissors will work best. A booster seat with a low back is also important so you can reach all sides of the hair from different angles. A comb with a pointed end can help you section the child’s hair.Household scissors are often too dull to use to cut hair. Multi-purpose scissors might work if you absolutely can’t get barber’s shears.Hair-cutting scissors can be found in your local pharmacy or grocery store.
Put newspapers, magazines or a towel under the chair to capture the hair clippings that are bound to fall. Put a towel around your child’s shoulders so that the clipped hair doesn’t end up covering the toddler’s clothing.;
, It’s a good idea to provide a distraction for the toddler so he or she doesn’t get wiggly. Schedule the haircut for a time when your child is feeling happy and well. Do not attempt the haircut if your child is tired, hungry or sick.


Try giving the toddler a lollipop to suck on while you are cutting the toddler’s hair.In order to further distract the toddler, you may want to put him or her in a chair that you set in front of the television. This should keep their focus elsewhere, and make it easier for you to cut their hair.Talk a lot to the toddler with a smile on your face, and provide positive feedback. Make the cut a fun experience for the toddler by involving him or her in the process, perhaps by singing a song together as you cut. Don’t expect absolute perfection when cutting a toddler’s hair as most get a little restless.

, It’s a good idea to spray a mist of water on the toddler’s hair before you try to cut it. If there are any tangles in the child’s hair, buying a spray bottle of detangler is also a good idea. If the hair is not evenly wet, the cut may end up uneven.


Wetting the hair will make it easier to cut the hair properly. In order to wet it down, you could buy a water bottle, fill it with water, and spray it around the toddler’s hair.
If you don’t have a water bottle handy, you can buy one for a dollar or two at many big box or department stores. You will also want a wide-tooth comb.You could also wet down the comb, and comb the toddler’s hair with it before trying to cut it, in the case that you don’t have a water bottle available. Another method is to use a wet washcloth and a bomb to wet the hair. Don’t wet the hair too much. Just mist it."

Clip back sections of the hair.,
Pick the right angle when you cut.,
Start with the front.,
Snip slowly.",How to Cut a Toddler's Hair2," It’s going to be a lot easier with a squirmy toddler to cut the hair in smaller sections. This is true even for toddlers with shorter hair.


Take a clip, and fasten back all of the hair that you are not cutting. Pull out a small piece of the hair one section at a time.
You don’t need many sections. Pull away a piece that you will find manageable to cut. The goal is to be able to focus on one section at a time.
You also don’t need to make each section exactly the same size. It’s not that important. Sectioning back the hair just makes it easier to cut when a toddler gets a little antsy.

, One of the most important things when it comes to cutting toddler’s hair is to cut at an angle.


Try to cut the toddler’s hair at a 45-degree angle. Slant your cuts toward the toddler’s neck as you do so. If you don’t cut at an angle – other experts say to cut at 11 o’clock – you will make the hair too blunt.
Hold a piece of hair at the 45-degree angle, while you cut along your fingers, using your fingers to keep the line straight.
If your child has cowlicks on the top of his or her head, leaving the hair longer on top can help with that. The additional heaviness of the hair will likely stop it from standing straight up.

, Start cutting the toddler’s hair from the front because that's what people see first. This is partly because your toddler will probably be most compliant at first.


Start with the bangs. Cut from the outside of the toddler’s eyebrow to the outside of the second eyebrow. Pull the bangs straight down, and then cut them at an 11 o’clock or 45-degree angle.
Hold the child’s hand gently with one hand while you snip the bangs.Make sure that you keep the scissors positioned away from the child’s skin and eyes. Be ready for sudden movements the child might make.
Some parents find it easiest to start around the ears when the child is least restless at the beginning of the cut. Cut very slowly around the ears so you don’t cut them.

, In order to cut toddler’s hair, it’s important that you are gentle but firm, and that you snip tiny pieces at a time slowly. Hold the sections vertically.


This will make it easier to control the cutting, especially if the child moves suddenly. In order to cut a piece of hair, take a small piece between your fingers. Cut at an 11 o’clock or 45-degree angle not parallel to your fingers. This will blend the hair better. If you cut the hair too parallel to your fingers, you will end up with hair that is cut too bluntly for most people’s tastes.
Choose the lengths with the first section. As you work around the head, take a little piece of the previous section to guide you on how short to go.
Slide your fingers down the hair’s length, and then cut with the scissors below your fingers. Start out by cutting less than you think you want. You can always do more if you feel it’s necessary.

Section medium or long hair.,
Brush the remaining hair in the back straight down.,
Complete the cut.",How to Cut a Toddler's Hair3," Many toddlers have short wispy hair. However, some toddlers, especially girls, might have longer hair. It’s much easier to work on thinner and smaller sections of hair, so sectioning the hair is very important.


With longer toddler hair, it’s often a good idea to part the hair in the middle. This will make it more likely that the strands you cut will not end up uneven.To cut longer hair, take a wide-tooth comb, and section the toddler’s hair into sections. Start with the top of the hair, and clip sections of the hair up so you can start by working on the hair that’s underneath and in the back.
Make two sections out of the hair by each one of the child’s ears. Then, make two sections in the back, splitting it down the middle. Next, split each of the two back sections in half. Lift the sections up and clip them.

, This hair will serve as the length guide. The length guide is the most important cut you will make.


Cut the remaining hair in the back at the length that you would like the toddler’s entire haircut to fall.
You will match all of the remaining cuts to the same length as the guide. You need to make sure that you can see the guide as you cut the other sections, so make sure the sections you take down next are not too thick.Cut the hair in a straight line. Pull all of the girl’s hair to the back. Cut a straight line, with your scissors at 11 o’clock, to create a soft textured line. Do this by holding a section of the hair with your fingers, and then snipping off the desired amount.

, Cut the back of the hair first by pulling the hair straight down on the sides.


Now connect it with the back hair to even it out. Try to get the toddler to look slightly down while you cut.As you cut a section of hair, let down some of the hair in the clips, to continue trimming the hair. Use the first section of cut hair as the guide for length when trimming the rest.
Pull down the next section, and trim it to match the guide section’s length. Do this section-by-section. If the child’s hair is thick, you can pull down smaller pieces of the section so you’re able to see the guide.
To cut the sections by the ears, comb the child’s hair by the ears all the way back, and work from behind.

"
"
Use clippers.,
Clean up the cut.,
Cut the rest of the hair.",How to Cut a Toddler's Hair4," It’s possible to cut a toddler’s hair with clippers, especially in the case of shorter hair.Buy a clipper set at a drug or department store. They should run you around $20. You can use the clipper guard.Put the plastic Number 3 guard on the clipper. Plug it in. Hold the clippers at about a 90- degree angle. Clip straight up from the base of the beck.
Cut upwards with the clippers, and do so all around the toddler’s head.

, Once you are done cutting the back and sides of the toddler’s hair, you will want to fine tune the cut.


Remove the guard from the clippers, and clean up the hair around the toddler’s ears. Go slowly so you don’t cut the child.
Use the clippers to clean up and shape the cut’s style around the nape of the toddler’s neck. Again, go slowly so you don’t nick the child.
It’s very important that you proceed with great caution, making sure to distract the child and go very slowly, anticipating the possibility of sudden movements.

, After using clippers, you should use scissors to complete the toddler’s haircut. Don’t use clippers to cut the top or front of a toddler’s hair.


Start at the top of the hair by taking a section in the front. Decide the length you want. Hold your fingers across the section. Cut the hair away. Work your way to the back.
Use the first cut as a guide cut. Cut the entire middle section and then cut the sides. Consider the hair as having three sections on top, the sides of the hair and the middle section.
Work toward the back of the middle section. Blend the top of the hair with the sides. Cut at a 45-degree angle. Hold a section of the hair in your fingers, and cut at this angle. Then take another small section and do the same, working your way around the head.

Start in infancy.,
Use toddler tooth care products.,
Floss.,
Start brushing your toddler's teeth!,
Go to the dentist.,
Give your child drinking water that is fluoridated.,
Make sure your toddler is getting a well-balanced diet.",How to Clean Toddler's Teeth," You should start gently wiping your baby's tooth when it first emerges with a soft, clean washcloth. Your child will get used to the feeling long before childhood.;
, Toddlers have smaller mouths than adults, and ideally should use toothbrushes designed for them. Use ""training toothpaste"" which does not contain fluoride in concentrations enough to cause harm if swallowed. Have him or her get excited about picking out a colorful toothbrush and a favorite flavor.

, Remember to floss daily, so you can pick up plaque from your child's teeth and gums before it hardens.

, Get the toothbrush with soft bristles and use a small pea-sized amount of the children's fluoride toothpaste. Clean both the outsides and insides of your toddler's teeth, also make sure to brush their tongue to get any hidden bacteria. Be sure to spend at least two minutes brushing; most people do not brush long enough. Clean your toddler's teeth at least twice a day.

, Keep regular appointments, and be sure to ask questions.

, Usually it will tell you on a water bottle if the water is fluoridated, but if your drinking water supply isn't fluoridated, you can talk to your toddler's physician or dentist about getting fluoride supplements.

, Eating a healthy, balanced diet is good for dental care because it provides the vitamins and calcium to help maintain healthy teeth. Avoid too much refined sugar. Foods like apples can help reduce plaque buildup.

Find a good sized box.,
Fill the bin with uncooked rice.,
Add toys to the bin.,
Watch how the toddler reacts.,
Use different holiday toys in the rice box.",How to Create a Rice Box for Toddlers," This can range from a small bin to a medium sized portable tub. It's up to you if you want the toddler to stand up while playing or have them sit in it (like a swimming pool environment).;
, The cheapest way to buy a bulk amount is to go to a wholesale warehouse, such as Costco.

, Think of things that a toddler would play with in a regular sandbox such as plastic pails and shovels. You can also provide safe kitchen utensils such as plastic spoons, cups, or sieves or colanders.

, Uncooked rice is a different texture than sand. Let them play with the rice by filling things up.

, For example, use old plastic Easter eggs and plastic carrots for them to fill up. Fill them up halfway, close the eggs, and use them as shakers.

Set an early bedtime.,
Develop a bedtime routine.,
Maintain your bedtime routine.,
Set clear boundaries and limits.",How to Cope with Sleep Regression in Babies and Toddlers1," Babies are usually ready for sleep between 6pm and 9pm. If you are putting your child to bed later than 9pm, or if they seem to be getting tired before you put them to sleep, try setting an earlier bedtime. The sleep regression, in some instances, could be due to the fact that the baby is overtired and unable to fall asleep., A set bedtime routine can help to prepare your child both physically and mentally for sleep. Choose a few calm and relaxing activities that will help transition your child to sleep. For example, you may give your toddler a glass of milk, brush their teeth, and then read two stories in bed, before turning out the lights.Avoid stimulating activities, such as watching television, actively playing, or reading a scary story.

, Many people will change their bedtime routine as a way to cope or manage sleep regression in toddlers. For example, you may be tempted to stay with your child until they fall asleep as a form of comfort. This is not a good idea and could lead to the formation of a new habit.Instead, it is important to stick with your regular routine. Sleep regressions typically only last 2-6 weeks and are normal among toddlers., Toddlers may try and stay up later by requesting another story or asking for more milk. One way to prevent these types of regressions is by setting clear limits and following them consistently.For example, you may say “We can read three stories and then it is sleepy time.” After the third story, you need to say goodnight and turn out the lights.

"

Increase the amount you feed the baby.,
Check on the child periodically.,
Avoid giving toys, milk, or stories in the middle of the night.,
Comfort the baby.,
Practice rolling, sitting, and crawling during the day.",How to Cope with Sleep Regression in Babies and Toddlers2," Infants may experience sleep regression as a result of a growth spurt. This means they could wake up hungry in the night. In order to avoid this, try feeding your child more throughout the day. In some rare cases, you may need to return to giving a late night feeding.Keep in mind this additional feeding is just temporary.
Talk with your doctor and keep track of the amount you are feeding the baby.

, If your toddler begins to cry in the middle of the night and usually they sleep through the night, you should check on the child. It is important to make sure that the child is not ill. Alternatively, they may be having a bad dream and just need to know that you are close by.Once you have ruled out an illness say “It is sleepy time, close your eyes and go to sleep.” This will reassure them of your presence without providing them with too much additional attention.

, When you check on your toddler in the night, it is important that you keep the visit short and to the point. Do not try and comfort your child until they fall back to sleep or provide them with toys, milk, or a story. This can easily develop into a habit because your child will realize that if they cry in the night they get extra parental attention., For young infants, sleep regression can result from new developmental changes, such as teething. They are not able to self-soothe, and as a result, you may need to comfort your child to help them get back to sleep. Try rocking the baby or rubbing their back while saying soothing words., You can help your baby sleep by giving them time to practice new movements during the day. For example, young babies are eager to learn to roll, sit, and crawl. By giving your child time to practice new movements you will exhaust them mentally and physically allowing them to sleep better.These activities will depend upon your child’s development stage, but may be contributing to a sleep regression.

"
"
Talk with your doctor or pediatrician.,
Find support among friends.,
Share the responsibility.,
Understand sleep regression is normal.,
Search for the cause of the regression.",How to Cope with Sleep Regression in Babies and Toddlers3," Although sleep regressions are completely normal among babies and toddlers, you should still talk with your doctor or pediatrician. In some cases sleep regressions could be a result of an underlying medical issue, such as reflux, asthma, allergies, an ear infection, or sleep apnea., You can also talk with other parents or friends in your life. Ask them if they ever dealt with sleep regression in their children and how they coped with it. Knowing that your friends have experienced the same thing, and made it through, can be comforting., Talk with your partner about the sleep regression and make sure that you both share the responsibility. For example, come to an agreement about who will be responsible for checking on the child during the night. Perhaps you can split this 50/50. This way you will not feel like you are doing it alone.If you are a single parent you can ask members of your extended family to help out during tough times. If possible, ask one of your parents to stay with you while your baby is experiencing a sleep regression.
If that is not possible, keep in mind that sleep regressions are short lived and your baby will begin sleeping through the night again.

, Always remember that sleep regression is a normal part of child development and that it will pass. It can be very tiring and stressful at the time, but keep in mind this will not last forever and you are not a bad parent.Sleep regressions typically take place at 3-4 months, 8-10 months, 12 months, 18 months, and two years. This can vary depending on the individual child.

, Sleep regression is often a result of a major change to the daily routine, or a result of a new developmental stage. For instance, at around two years of age, children will begin experiencing bad dreams or they may become afraid of the dark. Once you have determined the cause of the regression, you can tackle that head on.For example, you could purchase a nightlight to make them feel comfortable at night.
Alternatively, you can talk with them about the life changes (i.e. new sibling, new daycare, etc) so that they become accustomed to the change.

Pack a range of toys.,
Ditch a toy if:

There are numerous pieces needed.,
Try offering a coloring book with characters that your toddler loves.,
Consider bringing hand-held devices such as iPads, cell phones, or other devices.,
Bring books, books, and more books.,
Pack an unbreakable mirror.,
Bring activity boards, blankets, cubes, or books.,
Try Magic Ink.,
Get some grow capsules that expand in water.,
Let your little explorer use their imagination!,
Dressing dolls are a wonderful way to keep little hands busy!",How to Choose Entertainment for Toddlers During Long Trips," You want to include favorite toys, new toys, and regular toys. Favorite toys are the beloved ones that tend to keep them happy for a longer period of time. New toys are great for that last hour of traveling when everyone is getting crabby. Magically presenting a new toy may just end the tantrum and bust the boredom. Regular toys are needed because there probably aren't enough favorite toys to occupy your toddler for the whole trip; unless you want to spend all that money on new toys, you are probably going to need something else. Try to have at least one toy from each of these three categories in the end.
, A puzzle would not be a good idea because of all the pieces that could fall, get lost, or be thrown.
It is noisy. Any electronic toys shouldn't be used except for handheld devices with headphones. Also, musical toys that make noise should be discouraged.
It is large. Any toy that cannot comfortably fit into a backpack or bag that can be carried should not be used.
It is small enough to be a choking hazard. Any toy that fits through a toilet paper tube should not be used because it's a choking hazard.
It isn't age-appropriate. Your toddler should be able to play with all toys on their own, just in case. Plus, you don't need your toddler getting frustrated from an inappropriate toy and throwing a tantrum!
It will easily roll away. Balls, play cars, and the like, should not be used.

, Thick or triangular crayons are great.

Toddler should not yet use Play Packs. As wonderful as they may seem, these aren't safe. The tiny crayons are choking hazards and likely to roll away, and even the package tells you it's not designed for children under three.

, Download movies and songs, as well as toddler-friendly apps. Be sure to bring along headphones so that other passengers or people in the car don't have to listen to the noise.

Make sure the sound is at a reasonable level before you put the headphones on their eyes.

, Books are perfect for traveling and a great entertainment. Toddlers can look at these by themselves or you can have great bonding time by snuggling up for a story together. Use board books or light, paperback books. Books that have different textures to feel, lift-the-flaps, objects to smell, or that are interactive provide even more fun!, Unbreakable mirrors are safe and exciting. Try making funny faces, saying ""Who's that in the mirror?"", playing Peekaboo, or just being fascinated by reflections., Buying felt books with activities inside, small boards with flaps and knobs, using blankets from babyhood, and so on are all great ways to keep your toddler entertained.

Make your own activity board by taking a piece of cardboard no bigger than 11"" X 18"". Attach reflective tape, old keys, pieces of felt to lift, pipe cleaners with beads stringed on them to move back and forth, and anything else you can find.

, The marker only works on one kind of paper, so your toddler won't leave any marks behind!, This may entertain your toddler as they watch the object grow. Pack a bottle of water and Duct tape. Before you give it to your toddler, drop the object in and seal the cap with Duct tape. You can also buy one of those bottle that makes a tornado when you shake it. Note: Liquids cannot go on a plane so you can't use a tornado bottle or a growing object for those kinds of trips., Provide a play compass, map, play steering wheel (they are sold by many different toy companies), a pretend camera, and a favorite doll or stuffed animal., Look for dolls or stuffed animals with buttons to button, snaps to snap, shoes to tie, buckles to attend to, etc."

Decide what kind of daycare you want: professional facility or in-home.,
Visit the child care facility for a tour.,
Examine the daily and weekly schedule for the child care facility.,
Ask about the child care's check-in and check-out procedures.,
Find out what percentage of the staff is certified in early childhood education, child CPR and basic first aid.,
Talk with the daycare's manager about ongoing training for staff.,
Ask about the process by which the child care facility conducts background checks on its employees.,
Try the daycare out for a week.",How to Choose Daycare for a Toddler,"


In-home daycares are run by an individual or family, in a private home. They tend to be less expensive than professional daycares and offer a more personal relationship with the caregiver.
Professional daycares are licensed with the state and held to consistent standards. While more expensive than in-home options, they often have better-trained staff and more extensive facilities.;
, While the manager or sales representative shows you the high points, scan each area for safety and cleanliness.


Check safety by looking for hazards like cleaning supplies, electrical hazards and heavy objects that can fall down.
Check the storage shelves and other out-of-the-way areas for cleanliness. Every daycare will keep the bathrooms and public areas clean, but the out-of-sight areas will give you a good idea of how seriously the child care facility takes the details.

, A quality center will have a robust program of structured activities to enrich and entertain your child.

, If a facility doesn't carefully monitor the children, and restrict adult access, it's not as safe as one that does.

, Some states require this for all staff, while others require it only for some -- and many daycares can operate under legal loopholes that waive this requirement.

, A good center continuously improves its employees' knowledge and skill bases to better help the children in their care.

, This is required by state law, but not all daycares do this. Backgrounding is such a common part of the job that a daycare manager should be able to easily describe the basic process. If she can't, that may be a sign that it's not done there.


If the daycare makes frequent use of parent volunteers, it's a good idea to ask how closely their backgrounds are checked.

, How happy your child is with the program, children and adults will be a major indicator of whether or not a particular daycare program is right for your family.

Pick out clothes that are easy to put on if your child is in a cranky mood.,
Consider allowing your child to choose between outfits.,
Let a self-dressing toddler pick out her own outfit.,
Praise your child’s outfit, even if it makes her look a little strange.,
Open up any items aside from clothing that you will be using.,
Leave plenty of time to change your child.",How to Change Your Toddler's Clothes Without a Tantrum1," Toddlers can get wrapped up in their play and having to stop in order to change their clothes can lead to a tantrum. In order to avoid suddenly making your child stop her play, warn your child about the impending change. Giving your child a warning can help to make her feel like she is in control.


However, avoid giving your child a time constraint that actually involves minutes. Instead, choose a song or something else that is short, familiar and has a definite end. In the case of a song, you can put the song on and tell your child that when the song is over, she will have to get changed.;
, Make sure that your child understands that getting dressed is an important part of the day. Explain that the way a person dresses can show how they feel about themselves, and can determine how others see them. Compliment your child and her clothing to make her understand that changing into new clothes for the day is a good thing.


Of course, these concepts may be a little challenging for your child to grasp, so you should also explain that you are not trying to be mean when you make your child change her clothes. Instead, making her change is actually an act of love that can help her to put her best foot forward.

, Most tasks in life go more smoothly if a little advanced planning is done. In this case, having your child’s outfit picked out before you begin the changing process can help the process run much more smoothly.


Having the clothes all laid out is particularly helpful if you dress your child on a dressing table. Knowing where everything is ahead of time can minimize the amount of time you spend looking away from your child.

, While this will not always be possible, try to pick out clothes for your child that are easy to put on and take off. Characteristics of these kinds of clothes include:


Clothes that do not have a lot of ties, buckles, or buttons. Instead, use pullover shirts and slide-on pants.
Elastic is also great for kids because it allows them maximum movement.

, Instead of insisting that a toddler wear a certain outfit, you can try giving in a little to your child’s new-found independence. Create two appropriate outfits for that day’s activities and then allow your toddler to choose between the two.By doing this, your child will feel like she has some independence, while still being dressed appropriately.

, If your child is capable of dressing herself and you don’t particularly care what she wears that day, consider allowing your child to pick out her own outfit and get dressed herself.


Keep in mind that you should still help your child distinguish from clothes that are inside out or backwards.

, Once your child has dressed herself, make sure to praise her for her abilities (even if her outfit looks a little wacky). Giving her praise will help her to feel like getting dressed is a positive thing.

, If you are going to use lotion, baby wipes, or diapers when dressing your child, open these containers up before beginning to dress your child. Preparing these items beforehand can help to streamline the dressing process so that you decrease the chances of your child throwing a tantrum.

, Toddlers are easily distracted and often take much longer than adults think they should to accomplish things. It is important that you leave plenty of time for changing your toddler’s clothes, instead of waiting until right before you have to leave the house. Leaving plenty of time can be difficult in a busy household, but it is important.


Parents that hurry while dressing their toddler or rush a self-dressing toddler are more likely to be met with a tantrum.

Dress your child first thing in the morning.,
Give your child a ‘changing’ toy.,
Talk to your child while you dress her.,
Challenge your toddler to a race.,
Pretend to be confused.",How to Change Your Toddler's Clothes Without a Tantrum2," Dressing your child when she is still sleepy and unaware of the world can help to reduce the chances of a tantrum.However, once your child recognizes this routine, its less likely that she will be fooled by it in the future.

, Sometimes distracting your child with a toy can help to fend off a tantrum. Consider designating a particular toy as the changing toy—your child only gets to play with that particular toy while you are changing her.


You could also allow your child to bring her favorite toy with her when she changes clothes.
Keep in mind that you should change out the toy when it stops being a distraction for your child.

, Another way to distract your child is to talk to her or tell her a story while you change her clothes. You could engage her in the plans for the day (thereby giving her something to get excited about while you change her).


You could also ask her questions about the day. Ask questions like, “What do you plan to do at Ms. Sally’s house today?” or “We are going to the zoo today. What animal do you want to see?” If children are talking, they sometimes forget what is going on around them.

, When you make changing fun, your child is much less likely to resist it. This is particularly true if you are in a rush and need the child to change quickly. In these instances, challenge your child to a clothing race. You can either make the race be against yourself, or against the clock.


However, if your toddler does not have a grasp on time, use your child’s favorite song. Tell your child that if she can get dressed before the song ends, she wins the game.

, Another way to get your child to put on her clothes is to act like you are confused about where each article of clothing goes. Hand your child a shirt and tell her “here are your pants!”. Your child will most likely laugh and correct you. When she does, ask to be shown how to properly wear a shirt.


Your child will most likely be eager to show you what to do because this allows her to show her independence.

Figure out what you need.,
Organize what you have.,
Purchase sturdy, neutral pants.,
Buy shirts that fit a color scheme.,
Buy ""specialty"" items.,
Avoid too many trendy items.",How to Build Your Toddler's Wardrobe1," In order to effectively build your toddler’s wardrobe, you need to assess both what you have and what you need. This is the first step in creating a “capsule wardrobe,” or a set of staple items that form the center of your toddler’s wardrobe. For instance, you might need 7-8 shirts, 3-4 sweaters, 5-6 pants, 10 pairs of socks, one hat, and one jacket.Determine how many bottoms, tops, socks, and outerwear your child goes through each week. You can set aside a laundry basket for just their clothes and see what you come up with after one week.;
, Carefully sort through everything your toddler has, sorting items by type (tops, bottoms, dressy clothes). Then separate clothing items into three piles: keep, save for the future, and discard. Try your best to be honest and practical! Holding on to items you don’t like (or don’t use) does not help boost your toddler’s wardrobe. Keep in mind that solid color items are easiest to mix and match.You can give your unwanted clothes to friends and family, donate them to local thrift stores, or sell them on Ebay or ThredUp.

, As a general rule, most kids can get by with about 5-6 pairs of pants. Depending on how many pairs of pants you already have, you might need to pick some up!Purchase kids pants that are:


Sturdy.
Neutral in color.
Low-maintenance/easy to wash.
Up to one size larger than you need (so that they will last longer).

, When it comes to shirts, it is good to have a few extra on hand. Most kids can get by with about 7-8 shirts. Shirts can be very personal items, so seek your child's feedback when you select shirts for them to wear.Look for shirts that:


Fit a certain color scheme, such as pastel colors, stripes, blue and grays, etc.
Are not too flashy or trendy (as these go out of style quickly).
Are low maintenance/easy to wash.

, Think about what other “specialty” items your toddler may need. These are items they'll use occasionally and include dressy outfits (2-4), extra outerwear (raincoat), or clothing for specific activities (swimsuit).

, Flashy items--such as fancy dresses, bow ties, frilly jackets, or trendy accessories--are fun to buy. But more often than not, these items get used once, and then left in the closet gathering dust. Keep your purchases of these items to a minimum. Instead, focus on practical items you can easily mix and match."

Never shop without a list.,
Shop the clearance rack.,
Buy clothes online.,
Check out used clothes.,
Seek out hand-me-downs.,
Buy higher quality items.",How to Build Your Toddler's Wardrobe2," If you want to build a cute, functional wardrobe you have to be strategic. Avoid heading into a clothing store (or browsing online) without a specific list and a plan. You don’t want to be swayed by cute items that you don’t need. You’ll end up wasting money, wasting time on extra laundry, and cluttering up your kid’s closet.Instead, shop for items that:


Have a classic look (like jeans and sweaters).
Have solid colors or basic patterns.
Will work with items you already have.
Are not overly trendy or flashy (these items tend to have short shelf lives).

, Armed with your list, be sure to hit the clearance racks first. You can often find off-season items for a fraction of the full retail price. If you are aware of which items your child needs, you can make browsing the clearance rack a regular part of your routine.Try not to buy things you don’t need just because they are cheap.
Look for items you can mix and match.

, Retailers often have online sales that are not offered in stores. Even if you find an item in a physical store, it is a good idea to check the price online. Regularly check online retailers for sales and deals.Search for special online sales.
Search for online coupons and coupon codes.

, Children grow so quickly that their clothes are often grown out of before they are worn out. Investigate used children’s clothing to find gently used items to improve your toddler’s wardrobe.Keep an eye out for higher end brands. You might look at:


Thrift stores.
Consignment shops.
Garage sales.
eBay.

, If you have kids of varying ages, hand-me-downs are likely already a part of your practice. But even if you have just one child, parent groups and other organizations in your area may organize clothing swaps for kids clothes. You can also ask for hand-me-down from friends with children.

, When possible, selecting higher quality clothing items will help your toddler’s clothes last longer. This is especially true for outerwear, sweaters, and sturdier items. T-shirts, on the other hand, and likely to end up stained either way.Check used clothing stores for high-end brands.

Maintain a laundry schedule.",How to Build Your Toddler's Wardrobe3," In order to maintain a cute, fashionable, and realistic toddler wardrobe, you need pieces that can work together in different contexts. Select clothing that can mix and match, and avoid items that will only work in a specific outfit. Additionally, look for items that could be worn across seasons.Look across what your toddler already has and identify patterns.
For example, does your child wear a lot of blue, or a lot of stripes? Select items that will work with blue and/or stripes.

, You’ll never be able to pick out fashionable looks for your toddler if their drawers and closet are a mess. Make an effort to keep their wardrobe organized so that choosing an outfit is simple and efficient.Use plastic bins inside of drawers.
Install shelves in the closet.
Use hanging storage behind doors.

For example, if you have established a strong set of items that can get you through one week, you must be sure to wash, dry, and fold your kid’s laundry weekly.Choose a laundry day (such as Sunday).
Pre-treat spills to reduce stains.
Fold clothes right away to reduce wrinkling and clutter.

Don't even leave the room for a second. You would be surprised what kind of mess a toddler can make in the time that you take to use the bathroom. If you are going to get something then take the toddler with you. Keep anything dangerous away form his/her reach.;
, Toddlers need to eat more often than adults, so give them a snack if they need it. Talk to the parents about what they want the child to snack on. You might give them a drink of juice, water, or milk. Some kids might eat animal crackers or fruit snacks. Watch them when they eat. Learn how to get things out of little children's mouths if they are choking.


Do not feed the child anything they are allergic to. Their parents should tell you before hand if they are allergic to anything. Make sure that the snacks are not too big that it could choke on. Neither too small that it could swallow without chopping it down.

, The smell is usually a strong indicator. If the child is recently toilet trained, ask regularly whether he or she needs to use the bathroom and watch for signs of needing to go. If you wait until the child tells you they have to use the bathroom, it might be too late, and then you have a mess to clean up.

, Get your own first aid kit, and cover it with stickers and supply it with fun colorful band-aids. If you can't get those, offer to color on the band-aids when a kid gets hurt. Make sure you have all the important stuff. Call this box the Boo-boo Box. Don't make a big deal about an injury, just say, ""Uh-oh! Let's get you a band aid!"" This way, they will laugh and be happy.

, Keep important numbers like the child's doctor, the poison control center, and the parents' cell phones by the home phone. These are vital in an emergency. Only call the parents if necessary or in an emergency, though. You don't want to cause them stress or bother them if they're doing something important.

, Take a babysitting class with the Red Cross, a local community center, or local community college. They will teach you CPR and useful information if something bad happens. They can also teach you a lot about how to deal with kids effectively and play with them well. These classes are usually cheap, and will look impressive to any parents looking to hire a babysitter.

, Try to learn as much as you can about the rules the parents have set both for the child and for you. Don't break any rules the parents have, such as bed times and whether or not they can have junk food before bed. Not only is this bad for the kid, but you might even get caught if the child knows how to talk at all. If the child say ""Mommy or Daddy always let me _________"" don't believe them. Children like to test limits to see if they can get their way.

, If the child needs to be disciplined, make sure you've worked out with the parents ahead of time how that discipline should be handled. Different parents have different rules. Even if you think it's okay to spank, for example, the parents might not believe that and you should respect their wishes.

, Don't go digging in the fridge. It's their food that they buy. They invited you over to watch their child, not for dinner. You should also be respectful of the rest of their home, and not go digging in drawers, cabinets, or closets. You never know when a family has a nanny-cam too, so be careful!

, Kids love to play. Make sure you have loads of toys, building blocks, bring crafts it depends on age, rattles, books, and even spoons. Be creative! Sometimes bringing over some of your old toys will keep them happy. The toys may be old to you, but the toddler will be excited to have toys that are new to them.


Be prepared to change games multiple times. Kids at that age have a very short attention span.

, Take them for a walk, in a stroller. Point out different things on the sidewalk or the road. Make a game out of crossing the street safely remember to say to the toddler, ""Look left and right. No cars, we can cross!"" Eventually, you'll have the toddler saying it with you! You can hold hands and go for a walk too, if they're able to walk, but this should not be for much more than to the end of the street and back.


Another option is to run around and be crazy with them, but this should be done strategically. You have to spend hours doing this, if you're going to do it before putting them down for bed. Doing just a little bit of crazy play before bed makes them more hyper. Doing a lot for an extended period of time will make them hyper very briefly before they just collapse from exhaustion.
Bring out your artistic side. Color with crayons. Ask the kid to draw a picture of their family, pet, or their favorite toy. They will enjoy telling you about the things that they like. You can also give the child building bricks or blocks. Help them learn to build different kinds of towers and knock them down, or he or she may act upset if it falls down, but just help them, a little, to build it again.

, Small children, even the very active ones, usually love to read books. Sit on the floor or couch with a book, blanket and a stuffed animal, and read with them. Put the toddler on your lap to read the story. They love cuddles! Goodnight Moon, Green Eggs and Ham, and Are You My Mother? are good book choices for most toddlers.


Show pictures in a book that has pictures of farm or zoo animals. Say, ""Do you see the doggy? I see the doggy! Where's the horse? There's the horse!"" Kids love to show what they know, and will soon be pointing them out to you.
Describe an animal and ask what sound it makes. Examples could be cows, horses, and pigs. Start being a little bit silly. Make animal sounds or noises for any books with animals. Get the child to make the sounds too.

, Sing a classic nursery rhyme, or something that they would know. Maybe they can even suggest one! Kids love songs, especially songs with lots of clapping and moving around. Old MacDonald, Hokey Pokey, Wheels on the Bus, Incy Wincy (or Itsy Bitsy) Spider, and anything from Raffi's extensive collection of children's songs are great for small children.

, If the child is a slightly older toddler, you can teach them how to sort toys by kind, size, color, or what it does. Sort again by a different rule.

, If there or solid color shapes or toys, when the child picks up one of them say the color excitedly like it's a game: ""Red!"",... ""Blue!"",... ""Green!"" When they start to get it, say something like, ""Can you put all the reds together? What toy is red? Show me."" so that they can practice identifying colors.


Call-out the color when you put one in a group and when the child puts one in, or takes one, or works with them or messes up a pile.

, Count toys up to 5 or 6 if they seem interested in numbers. Encourage them to count even it it is mixed up. Don't make a fuss about mistakes. Give them lots of examples of each number, by making several piles of two or three toys.

, Present the toys one at a time, when playing with toys. This helps because if there are many toys to choose from at once, they'll only play with the pile for a few moments and get bored and the house will be messy. Ask the toddler to help you clean up, and make a game out of it. Thank them for helping, this will make them feel good and want to help again.


If there is only one toy, they'll stick with it until they get bored, and you can hand them another one, but later offer 2 or 3 related toys because sometimes they tend to play with more than one toy at a time.

, Don't say harsh things or get angry. Don't be sarcastic, because you will only confuse the child, if they are old enough to understand some words. It is okay to ""pretend anger, playfully,"" as if insulted or pretending amusement, etc. Be a clever actor, but not too silly, be kind of serious, and use the pretending to teach.


You can show hurt feelings from a child's actions or words, however. Realize that though they may say anything, they usually don't mean it, and they usually get over it very quickly. Just pretend shock, giggle and chuckle at their smarting off or their cute actions, they should cooperate (better than if you were to have a war of wills and serious words).
Happily explain what you really mean, in a gentle way, but don't be surprised that they make a game of touching things and looking at you to see how you react, just say ""no-no"". Try to give an alternative activity.

, Never call the child a Brat, Bratface, Rugrat, Pest, bad words, Ankle Biter, etc. Toddlers are great at picking up words and you never know what they'll repeat to their parents! Also, some families might believe some words are rude when you think they are not. For example, instead of "" Stupid"", try ""Silly"" instead.

, If the toddler wakes up and starts screaming or crying for their mom or dad, just sit with them and softly say ""shhhh"" and tell them ""It's okay; I'm here."" If they mention wanting mommy or daddy, tell them that when they wake up, their mommy will be there and give them lots of kisses. They need to know that everything will go back to normal soon.


Don't bring up their parent if they don't though. That will only upset them.
You can also try singing them lullabies. And rock them on a rocking chair.

Assist your toddler to climb up onto the stool in front of the sink.,
Teach them the differences between the cold and hot water tap.,
Have your child hold both hands under the running water.,
Demonstrate thorough scrubbing.,
Turn the faucet back on and rinse away the soap.,
Have your child dry their hands on a towel and give them a hand!

",How to Teach Toddlers to Wash Their Hands," Make sure that the stool is well-balanced and secured on the floor. If accessible, they may be able to reach the sink better on the side instead of the front.


Roll or push up any long sleeves, if necessary. Show them how to do this for themselves until they get used to doing it without prompting.;
, Tell them that the cold water tap is the only one they are allowed to touch. If you want to make the water warmer, add in and test the hot with the cold.


If you have a single-tap faucet, turn on the water and set the temperature yourself.

, Turn the faucet off.



Bar soap: Show your toddler how to roll it between both hands to make bubbles. Bar soaps come in all shapes and sizes, so it may be a good practice to start off with small ones first (like the ones you see in hotels) rather than a huge one that they can't hold.
Hand soap: Some kids may have trouble pressing down the pump with one hand, so you might have to help them. Floral or kid-friendly designs may entice them to wash their hands more.







, Explain they must wash for at least 20 seconds to get rid of all the ""yucky germs"". Singing the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice (once if you go slow) or singing the ABCs with your child makes it more fun to spend time washing hands. Be sure to lather the top of the hands, palms, and wrists. Between the fingers and fingernails are also important places to wash.

, Use a paper towel to turn it off to avoid germ transmission.

Prepare in advance.,
Take a few deep breaths.,
Take a time-out.,
Have realistic expectations.,
Remain positive.",How to Be Patient with an Impatient Toddler1," Trying to come up with ways to entertain a toddler can be difficult when they're impatient and you aren't prepared for the situation. It’ll be much easier to remain calm when dealing with an impatient toddler if you've planned ahead.This way you'll already have strategies in mind to use with the toddler and you can address the situation with a positive attitude.


Try keeping a list of activities to use. Being anxious may make your mind go blank, so it will be helpful to have a list of activities that you can turn to as needed.
If you know you're going to be in a situation that might try a toddlers patience, go ahead and plan ways you can both limit the wait and preoccupy the toddler. For example, you might want to avoid taking your toddler with you to the bank at the end of the day on a Friday.
When possible, find out if there's a wait where you are going and how long of a wait it is. For instance, you might call ahead to a restaurant and ask how long the wait is to be seated.
Try to always keep a few entertaining and distracting items with you to help time go by a little quicker for the toddler. You might, for example, keep a coloring app on your phone, or keep some action figures or stuffed animals in your car.;
, This is a great way to relax yourself so that you are in the right frame of mind to tackle an impatient toddler. Deep-breathing relieves tension and stress and can help you feel more energized and focus – all of which help when you're working with toddlers. It’s something you can do before you interact with a toddler. You can also have the toddler do it with you as a way to address their impatience.


Inhale slowly through your nose, hold the breath for a few seconds, and then release it slowly through your mouth. Repeat this a few times until you're calmer.
Talk through your actions with the toddler. You might say, “Now I'm going to breathe in through my nose. Now we hold it… and now, we let it out through our mouth.”
You can also try doing a body scan to see where you are holding tension in your body. This can help you to relax any muscles that you are clenching, which may make it easier to take care of your toddler.

, If you've been dealing with an impatient toddler and you feel yourself losing your patience or your temper, take a brief break from the situation. Physically or mentally separating yourself can help calm you, improve your mood, and give you the extra energy you need to remain patient. It can also give you a few moments to come up with more creative ways to handle the toddler.


Before your interaction with the toddler take a few minutes to yourself. Take a brief walk away from the area to make sure you are calm and have a positive attitude.
If there is another adult that can take care of the child, you can also take a brief break while you are interacting with the toddler to maintain or regain your composure.
If you can't physically leave the area, take a mental break. Depending on the toddler, you may not want to close your eyes, but you can still picture yourself peaceful and calm.
Another option is to go outside. Try heading outside with your toddler if you are able to help your brain identify that you are taking a break.

, Sometimes as adults our expectations for children can be a bit unrealistic. We may forget that emotionally, mentally, and socially toddlers are still developing the skills they need to show patience.Most toddlers have very little patience or understanding of ‘later’ or ‘in a little while’. Keeping in mind what is age appropriate behavior and situations for toddlers can help you be patient with an impatient toddler.


For instance, it’s unreasonable to expect a three year old to sit still, quiet, and patient through a documentary on undiscovered tribes of the jungle.
If a wait extends past a reasonable time, be a bit more understanding of the toddler’s impatience and reconsider rescheduling the activity.
Keep in mind that your child will not be a toddler forever. They will grow out of this stage eventually. Try to enjoy spending time with your child and make happy memories.

, If you approach the situation thinking how awful it to deal with an impatient toddler, chances are you’ll have a difficult time. Instead of dwelling on the negative, try to find the silver lining. Keeping a positive attitude can help you remain calm and patient and can also help you keep the toddler occupied and calm.


Remember that toddlers are easily distracted. Eventually they'll forget what they wanted so urgently and turn their attention to something else.
Also keep in mind that even the longest wait has to end some time.

Purchase sunglasses which offer ultraviolet (UV) ray protection.,
Find sunglasses that cover the skin surrounding your toddler’s eyes.,
Look for lenses with polycarbonate lenses.",How to Buy Sunglasses for Toddlers1," UV ray exposure is responsible for nearly all skin cancers, and also has negative effects on the lens and inner structure of your child’s eyes. Consequently, any sunglasses your toddler wears should offer protection against both types of UV rays: UVA and UVB. Only purchase sunglasses that have a clear label on the frame or lens stating that they protect against UV rays. Look for glasses that block 99–100% of these harmful rays.This is the single most important factor in determining which sunglasses will give your toddler’s eyes the most protection. Damage from UV rays accumulates over time, so it’s important that you begin protecting your child’s eyes from UV rays as early as possible.;
, Children have delicate skin surrounding their eyes, which is also susceptible to harmful UV radiation. This skin is more delicate and sun-sensitive than the corresponding skin on adults and, if possible, should be protected by sunglasses as well. Consequently, look for larger-framed sunglasses when possible; sunglasses with narrow frames will leave more sensitive skin unprotected.A wraparound style will provide the most facial protection possible by covering not only the skin immediately around the child’s eyes, but also skin near their temples.

, Polycarbonate is the preferable material for toddlers’ sunglasses for a number of reasons: it’s tough and durable, and will not break or scratch easily. This material is also lighter than other types of glass used in optometry. Unlike cheap plastic (or cheap glass) lenses, polycarbonate lenses will have an even tint as your child looks through them, and will not appear darker in some parts than others.Polycarbonate lenses contain an added benefit: the material itself is UV protective and will protect your child’s eyes from damage. These are the type of lenses that are used in regular prescription glasses, and will not have an inconsistent tint or coating.
On the other hand, glass lenses are more breakable than plastic lenses, and could easily be broken by an active toddler. If your child sees an optometrist, ask the doctor which lens material they would recommend, considering the child’s age and activity level.

Distract them.,
Get them moving.,
Make waiting a game.,
Make them laugh.,
Ask for help.,
Praise them.",How to Be Patient with an Impatient Toddler2," When you are interacting with an impatient toddler one of the best ways you can help them wait is to distract them. When they aren't thinking about waiting, it’s much easier for them to pass the time peacefully. Do something (or a few different things) to occupy their mind so that the wait doesn't seem so long.


Pull out the toys, snacks, or activities you brought with you to distract the toddler if you had the chance to prepare in advance.
Use your electronic device to show them short, age-appropriate videos or download an educational app for them. Remember to monitor what they're doing on your device. However, keep in mind that your child should not have too much screen time. Children under between the age of two and five should be limited to one hour of screen time per day.Break this time into short 10 to 15 minute increments and make sure that you continue to interact with your child during this time.Present distractions one at a time with some waiting in between. For example, if you're waiting to see the doctor, you might give the toddler a puzzle and then wait a few minutes after they finish with it to give them the next distraction.

, Toddlers are always on the go anyway, so use that energy for your benefit. Instead of trying to make the toddler be still and quiet, get them active. Getting the toddler to focus on something physical can help them wait more patiently and expend some of their energy.Have the toddler do some basic stretches. For instance, have them rotate their head left, right, up, and down. Then have them stretch their back, shoulders, and the rest of their body. You can even try doing yoga with your toddler. Learn a few toddler-friendly poses and do these with your toddler as needed.
Even small movements like wiggling fingers, ears, their nose or toes can distract a toddler and help them wait.
Ask the toddler to clap or stomp to repeat a rhythm you give them if it won’t distract or disturb anyone else.

, For toddlers, playing is learning. You can help them wait by playing games that focus their attention on something other than waiting and challenge their mind.Interacting with the toddler and not just giving them something to do on their own can also help the time go by quicker for you as well.


You can play matching or sorting games. For instance, you can help the toddler find all the red things or round things in the area.
Try counting or alphabet games. For example, you could count the number of people or list things that start with a certain letter.

, Using humor can help calm a toddler on the verge, or in the middle of a meltdown. It can also be used to briefly distract the toddler.While you are making the toddler laugh you might boost your mood and attitude, also.


Make silly faces with the toddler or do something silly like see who can touch their nose with their tongue.
Talk to each other using silly voices. For example, you could say the alphabet like a robot or an alien.
If your toddler has a favorite movie or tv character, then you could do an impersonation to make your toddler giggle.

, Toddlers can be challenging even when they’re getting what they want and an impatient toddler can be too much for even the most seasoned person to handle. It's okay to ask for help distracting a toddler if it’s becoming too much for you to tackle. Sometimes just seeing a new face might distract a toddler enough to help them wait a little bit longer. If you have someone with you that can help, ask for their assistance.


For example, you could ask your spouse to entertain the toddler for a few minutes while you take a short break to calm yourself.
Or, for instance, you might ask an older child to help you play a game with the toddler.
You can also try teaching manners to your toddler, such as by teaching them how to shake hands, greet people, and introduce themselves.

, You can help a toddler wait patiently by praising and rewarding them while they are waiting.By doing this you’re reinforcing their good behavior so that they continue to wait patiently. You’re also making waiting a pleasant (or at least not so awful) experience for them.


Tell the toddler that they’re doing a good job waiting. For example, you might say, “You should be proud of how patient you're being. I'm proud of you.”
Give them a small reward every so often while they're waiting. For instance, you might let the toddler have a bit of their favorite treat or let them play with a special toy.

Be a good role model.,
Practice waiting.,
Encourage the toddler to problem-solve.,
Practice relaxation techniques with them.,
Teach them to be mindful.",How to Be Patient with an Impatient Toddler3," Patiently handling one situation with an impatient toddler is worth rewarding yourself for. However, teaching the toddler patience as a skill can help you and the toddler handle waiting in future situations. You can teach a toddler patience and help them wait in specific situations by showing them how to do it. Modeling appropriate waiting gives the toddler concrete examples of how to be patient.For example, if you’re waiting in traffic, you can talk to the toddler about what you were doing to remain patient. You might say, “I’m going to take a few deep breaths and play searching games while I’m waiting for traffic to move.”
Or, for instance, if you're a daycare teacher, you could talk to the toddler about strategies you use to remain patient. You might say, “When I’m waiting for someone to come, I make a list in my head of all the fun things we can do together.”
Pay attention how you talk to your toddler as well as other people when you are feeling patient. It is important to show your toddler that you can maintain your composure.

, You can help toddlers learn patience by giving them the opportunity to wait.This means creating situations in which they have to be patient and entertain or distract themselves. The more practice a toddler has waiting, the more patient they will learn to be.


Instead of immediately giving the toddler what they want, have them wait a few moments. For example, if the toddler tells you they want a snack, instead of immediately jumping up to cut some apple slices, tell them snack will be served in 20 minutes and they have to wait.
Use a timer to help the toddler get a sense of time. You can set it for five minutes and have the toddler wait that long to start a new activity.

, Doing this helps the toddler develop independence and patience. When a toddler can problem-solve, they can come up with ways to distract and entertain themselves when they need to wait.This means there's less entertaining and distracting you have to do.


You can prompt your toddler to problem solve by saying something like, ""What do you think you could do to pass the time?""
If the toddler is struggling to complete an activity or answer a question, instead of rushing in to help, give them time to work it out for themselves.
Offer hints and tips, but let the toddler come up with solutions on their own. For example, if they’re trying to put on their shoes and having a hard time, you might say, “Try unstrapping them first,” instead of taking the shoe and unstrapping the Velcro for the toddler.

, When they’re impatient, toddlers are known to get upset and many throw temper tantrums. Showing the toddler ways to calm and relax themselves can help them calm themselves down before they have an angry outburst.It also gives them some activities they can do when they have to delay gratification.


Try teaching your toddler grounding exercises. For example, you can ask your toddler to tell you five things they see, four things they can feel, three things they can hear, two things they can smell, and one good thing about themselves.
You can also teach your toddler how to use deep-breathing to calm down. You can show them how to inhale through their nose, hold it for a few moments, then release it through their mouth.
Or, for example, you can show the toddler how to close their eyes and visualize something pleasant. You might say, “Imagine you’re at your favorite place when you feel yourself getting tired of waiting.”

, Being present in the moment instead of thinking about what they want to do or have next can help a toddler be more patient.Being mindful of what they're thinking, feeling, and sensing can also occupy a toddler so that they don't have time to be impatient.


Show them how to be aware of their thoughts by asking them what they’re thinking. You can also show them by saying things like, “I’m thinking about lunch right now and I’m thinking about it a lot.”
Teach them to be aware of their emotions and feelings. For example, you might simply ask, “How do you feel right now? Happy? Excited? Bored? Sad?” Or, you could say, “Think about your feelings right now.”
Help them be aware of their senses by showing them how to mentally scan their body. You might say, “Start at your toes. How do they feel? What about your feet? Your ankles? Keep going.”

Find a frame that fits your child’s face.,
Look through the lenses.,
Choose durable lenses that will hold up outdoors.",How to Buy Sunglasses for Toddlers2," Toddler’s heads grow at different speeds, and there is no genuine one-size-fits-all style of sunglasses that will fit every child. When purchasing sunglasses for your toddler, bring your child with you and have them try on at least four to five pairs of sunglasses. Ask them which feels most comfortable, and look to make sure that the frames fit them well. The frames should be close-fitting, and should have springs in the hinges so that they won’t snap if opened wider than 90°.Frames that are too large will have extra room between the child’s temple and the hinge of the glasses, may barely balance on the child’s nose, and will fit their ears poorly.
Frames that are too small for the child will barely reach the toddler’s ears, and the hinges will look over-extended.

, In order to make sure that the lenses themselves have an even tint and will not distort your toddler’s vision, hold the glasses up to your eyes and look through the lenses. Make sure that both lenses appear to have the same color and degree of tint. If the tint or coloring is uneven, the glasses may not provide uniform protection from UV rays.Don’t stretch out toddler-size glasses by stretching them around your head. You can hold them about 5 inches away from your eyes to look through the lenses. Alternately, turn the glasses backwards and bring the lenses close to your eyes.

, Toddlers are both active and unsteady on their feet, so it’s likely that the sunglasses you choose will wind up on the ground a few times. Look for lenses that are scratch-proof and impact resistant; these qualities will likely be listed on label or attached tag. Plastic lenses have the advantage here: they are less breakable, and if they do break, won’t risk getting glass shards into your toddler’s eye.Because of the rough treatment to which your toddler may subject these sunglasses, you may also wish to purchase a backup pair. That way, if the first pair of glasses breaks or if the lenses get seriously scratched, you’ll have a second pair to offer the child.

Find a high-quality pair of sunglasses within your budget.,
Let your toddler help make the decision.,
Purchase prescription sunglasses.",How to Buy Sunglasses for Toddlers3," High-quality sunglasses with polycarbonate lenses will likely set you back $70–140. This may seem like a steep price tag, but cheaper sunglasses will not provide the same level of eye- and skin-protection for your toddler. A higher-quality pair of sunglasses will contain optometry-grade lenses which will not distort the child’s vision, and will also offer increased durability.Be wary of cheap sunglasses (such as those at mall kiosks) that sell for $3-5 (or less). While these may have a sticker which reads “Blocks UV rays,” this claim is dubious unless it specifies a percentage of UV rays blocked.
The frames and lenses of lower-quality sunglasses will also be made from cheaper material, so your toddler will likely go through several pairs. Higher-quality glasses will have more durability and longevity.

, Since your toddler will be the one wearing the sunglasses, it’s logical to let him or her play a role in the selection process. Toddlers may be drawn to brightly colored frames, or a certain style of glasses that they find appealing. Urge your child to look in a nearby mirror and see how they look in the sunglasses. It’s important to respect your child’s opinion, as they’ll be more likely to wear sunglasses that they chose themselves.After you’ve purchased the sunglasses, remind your toddler that their glasses need to be worn every time the child is outside.
You can model this behavior yourself: wear a pair of sunglasses whenever you’re outside, and the toddler will be more likely to wear theirs.

, If your child wears glasses every day for their vision, you can consider purchasing a pair of prescription sunglasses. These will have the same prescription as the toddler’s regular glasses, and will help shield their eyes and decrease glare when outside. The prescription glasses will also offer UV protection, which regular eye glasses do not provide.Bear in mind that prescription sunglasses can be pricey. If you’re worried that your toddler may break the glasses immediately you could substitute a pair of regular sunglasses. This shouldn’t bother your toddler, as long as they do not already need a strong prescription to compensate for their vision.

Play the stacking game.,
Let them play in the bath.,
Read a book.,
Do an art project.,
Play shadow games.,
Bring out the bubbles.",How to Entertain a One Year Old1," A favorite game for many babies and toddlers, this game can be played anywhere with no extra baby toys needed. To play this game, simply take any small objects you can, stack them together, and then knock the stack down. Baby will have fun knocking the stack down on their own too! This game is best done with toy blocks, but you can use any items you can find (so long as they won't break when you knock the stack over).


You can use tin cans (preferably empty and sealed off on top), plastic cups, small boxes,soft sponges and food items, among other small objects that can be found in your house.
Toy blocks are cheap, easy to find (sets can be frequently found at garage sales for about a $1), and also easy to store so if you think you'll be entertaining babies on occasion then you might want to consider keeping a set just as a backup option.;
, As long as you're willing to watch them vigilantly, a sink or bath-full of water is an easy way to keep a baby entertained for about an hour. You might not want to actually wash them, since too much soap can be irritating for their skin, but you can let them splash in the water with a couple of toys.


Again, this can be very dangerous. Babies can drown if you turn your back for even a second. Even just a little water in their lungs can be dangerous. If you want to take this route, you'll need to be really serious about paying attention.
If you don't have bath toys for babies, you can make a hand puppet out of a washcloth or a boat out of a Tupperware container.

, Babies can usually understand much more language than they are able to communicate. They'll be especially easy to engage if you read the books in the right way for a baby. Don't just read the text like you would for a child who can understand the words: take a more lively approach. Move your hand around the page, bouncing and sweeping, as you tell the child what's happening in the picture. Keep your voice energetic and show lots of exaggerated emotion. Baby will be fascinated!


""Goodnight Moon"" comes highly recommended for babies (it is, for some reason, almost addictive for small children), as do ""Brown Bear, Brown Bear"", ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"", and ""Pat the Bunny"".

, Babies don't have a lot of fine motor control but that doesn't mean that they're not hiding a little inner Van Gogh. Art is great at not only keeping them entertained but it's also an excellent way to stimulate their brains, give them important sensory experiences, and help them build those motor skills that they'll need to keep developing.


An easy project to do is to make a card for one of baby's family members. This can be a just-because card for mom, a birthday card for grandma, or a thank you card for brother or sister. Take a sheet of printer paper and fold it in half to make the card. Then, paint baby's hand and make a hand print on the front of the card.
Another good option is your old friend the coloring crayon. You'll probably need to pay attention to make sure it doesn't just go straight into baby's mouth, but a crayon and paper should be more than enough to get baby's interest.

, Babies are just starting to get the concept of shadows, so find a way to get them interested in this new concept by playing a game with shadows.The easiest way is to cut a butterfly shape out of a piece of paper and then shine a flashlight at it. Get your baby to try to chase the butterfly!


If you have the time and materials, you can also make full shadow puppets, which can be useful for making baby-safe ""TV"" that keeps your baby entertained.

, Bubbles is to babies as video games are to teenage boys. They will go nuts for bubbles. This is an easy way to fill up an hour and keep your baby feeling happy and energetic. It's also useful for motivating your baby to move around and do things you ask, making it a great way to teach them how to say things like ""more"".


If you don't have any bubble blowing equipment on you, don't worry. WikiHow can show you how to make bubble solution and a makeshift bubble wand!

Try to time car and stroller activity with nap time.,
Keep attachable toys.,
Keep food on hand.,
Try the transfer game for plane rides.,
Use a mirror for car trips.",How to Entertain a One Year Old2," Your best bet, of course, is to try to time anything you have to do out and away from home with when your baby takes a nap. By making sure that they're sleeping while you're out, this will reduce how much you have to worry about keeping them entertained.


For example, put them in a baby carrier right before naptime and then do your grocery shopping. They'll fall asleep on your chest and let you get your shopping done without a shouting match.
Another example is if you have to go on an airplane or a car trip. Schedule the travel to coincide with baby's nighttime sleep routine. Get them ready for bed but instead of putting them in bed, put them in the car. They sleep and let you drive in peace.

, For strollers and car seats, the thing that will help you the most is getting and keeping on hand some toys which can attach to where your child will be sitting. Babies love to throw their toys over the side or down onto the ground or floor, making them cry and creating more work for you. By keeping toys which latch onto the seat, you make sure that baby can get their toy back whenever they want.

, For keeping your junior happy and entertained while you're out and about, food can be crucial. They might not be really hungry, but taking the time to pick through a bowl of Cheerios can buy you just enough time to get through the line at the post office without a boredom meltdown.


Try to choose snacks that baby can eat alone. Small items that take a lot of time to eat are a great choice here. Cheerios, raisins, apple chips, and seedless grapes (halved lengthwise or quartered for safety) are all good options here.
Avoid hard foods, unhealthy foods, and foods which are difficult to chew and swallow (like peanut butter). This is especially important when you're in the car, since it's harder for you to notice when baby chokes. Also avoid messy foods like peas, which easily roll away from baby.

, Bring a series of nesting tupperware containers and a bag of dried peas or beans. Put baby to the task of transferring beans from one tupperware and into another. This will easily keep them entertained for hours.


If you didn't bring these materials with you or if you can't, you can use stuff that's found on the airplane in a pinch. Ask for some empty coffee cups and stack them. The child knocks them down. Or play the ""shell game"".

, Many parents use a rear-facing car seat (which is the safest method for a one year old), but this can leave your baby feeling stressed because they can't see you. Get a mirror which attaches to their seat. Not only will this reduce their stress by helping them see you, they can also entertain themselves by looking at their reflection.

Make a toy out of your keys.,
Give them paper to rip.,
Make a ""bank"".,
Sing children's songs that include movements.,
Play Peek-a-Boo.,
Download an app.",How to Entertain a One Year Old3," As long as you pay a little attention and are sure to remove items that might be very dangerous for them (like sharp beer bottle openers), keys are a great emergency toy for a baby. You can jingle the keys in front of them and watch as they shake them around. They're also a great candidate for baby's favorite game: dropping things and making you pick them back up.


Again, you'll really need to pay attention here. Make sure baby doesn't get those keys too close to anyone's eyes (including their own)!

, Ripping scrap paper is a great game for a baby and a great way to prove that you don't need a lot of fancy toys to keep a baby entertained. Pull some old newspapers out of the recycling and show baby how to rip them. Then, let her give it a try!

, Find a box, an old coffee can, or any container which you can cut a slot into with scissors or a box cutter (only cut into the plastic lid of a coffee can). Now find items that can be fit into the slot and are safe for baby. Plastic lids from Tupperware or canned items are good. You can also fold up think paper squares or even use food items, like biscuits. Baby will be thrilled with the ""thunk"" sound and the fun task of getting the object into the slot.

, You don't need anything but your voice to entertain a baby if you're willing to sing some songs. Babies may not understand the words but they'll love watching you move your fingers and your hands to act out any song with a lot of energy.



Learn how to sing The Wheels on the Bus.

Learn how to sing If You're Happy and You Know It.

Learn how to sing The Itsy Bitsy Spider.

, Peek-a-Boo is such a basic that many people don't realize just how much children love this game. Your baby will scream with laughter as you hide behind your hands or other objects in the room and then pop out with a big smile.


Towels or other pieces of fabric are particularly useful for playing Peek-a-Boo.

, In a real pinch, babies love cell phones. These are entrancing. If you have nothing else, you can at least keep a baby entertained for awhile by giving them your cell phone. Just be sure to pay attention and make sure they don't drop it.


Try Peek-a-Boo Barn, Bubbles (which just lets your baby pop bubbles), or any one of a number of flashcard apps for small children.
Try sitting the baby on a soft surface on the ground. This will make it easier to keep your phone safe.

When your child is ready, progress to night training.",How to Potty Train Your Child," It is very important that your child is developmentally ready to learn how to use the potty, as this will make the process so much easier and faster. When a child is ready to be potty trained will vary from child to child, and can be any age from 18 to 36 months. In general, girls tend to be toilet trained slightly earlier than boys - the average age for girls is 29 months, whereas for boys it's 31.You can tell if your child is ready to potty train by looking out for the following signs:

Showing an interest in the bathroom and how other people use it.
Possessing good motor skills - including the ability to walk to the bathroom, climb steps and pull down pants.
Using language skills - being able to understand simple instructions and follow them.
Having predictable bowel movements.
Understanding - through words or facial expression - of when they need to urinate or have a bowel movement.
Wanting to please parents and act like a grown up.
Knowing what the words wet and dry, clean and dirty, and up and down mean.
Keeping their diaper dry for two hours and waking up dry from a nap occasionally.
Wanting to get out of diapers and into underwear or training pants, and asking to get out of that dirty diaper.
Becoming more interested in being clean and dry. Noticing sticky fingers, dirty feet an diapers, etc.


You should never push your child to potty train if they are not ready - they will only resist you and the potty training process will be frustrating and time-consuming. Give you child another month or two and you will find it much easier.
It has also been proved that one of the most effective ways to potty train, is to start the process way before the physical process starts, with games and activities to prepare them for the general idea.;
, The number one thing you need in order to successfully potty train your child is patience! Potty training is a process, it does not happen overnight. You and your child will need to work on it together and overcome any accidents and setbacks. Although you hear of some parents who potty train their child over the course of a single weekend, it is completely normal for the training process to take up to six months.Try to be as consistently upbeat and encouraging with your child as possible and deal with any accidents calmly. Remember that no child is going to graduate high school in diapers - they will get there!
You should also be aware that although your child might be fully potty trained during the day, it is common for children to continue wetting the bed at night until the age of five. They should be able to stay completely dry by the age of six, but until that time be prepared to use pull-ups and plastic sheets at night., A training potty is the easiest and least intimidating option for a child new to potty training. You can get all sorts of cute potties, some in the shape of your child's favorite cartoon characters. These are a good choice as you want your child to feel as comfortable as possible with the potty and enthusiastic about using it. You should also consider getting a potty with a removable seat, which you can place on the toilet once your child is ready.


If you decide to use the toilet from the beginning, make sure to get a step stool for your child so their feet feel firm and secure while sitting on it. This will make them feel more stable and help eliminate the fear of falling in.
Consider placing the potty in the playroom or living area to begin with. This will help your child to get comfortable with the potty and less intimidated by the prospect of using it. They may also be more inclined to use it if it's within easy reach.

, Choosing the right time to potty train can make a huge difference in your chance of success. Avoid trying to potty train if your child has recently gone through a period of change - such as the arrival of a new sibling, moving to a new house or starting at a new day care - as these things can be stressful for a child and potty training will only add to that stress.


Choose a period when you can spend long periods of time with your child at home - so they will feel comfortable and secure with their environment and always have you there for encouragement and support.
Many parents choose to potty train their children over the summer months - not only because they tend to have more free time to spend with their children, but also because their child will be wearing less layers of clothing, which makes getting to the potty on time much easier for the child.

, Setting a schedule can help turn potty time into a routine, which will help your child adjust to their new responsibility and help them to remember to go all by themselves. To start off, try picking two to three times a day when you will put your child on the potty and let them sit there for a few minutes. If they use it, that's great, but if not don't worry about. You just need your child to get used to the feel of it.


To encourage your child to go, try to pick times when he/she is most likely to need the bathroom, like first thing in the morning, after mealtimes and before bed. You can also give your child extra liquids with their meals if you like, as this will help to get their digestive system going.
Make potty time part of your child's bedtime routine - they put their pajamas on, wash their face, brush their teeth and go to the potty. They'll soon remember to go all by themselves.

, Let your child get comfortable with it, so they understand that the potty is not an intimidating or scary thing at all. Put the potty in their play area, where they can sit on it fully clothed, while reading a book or playing with toys. Once they've grown accustomed to or even fond of the potty, you can move it to the bathroom.

, Your child next needs to understand what the potty is actually for. To explain it, try taking your child's dirty nappy and popping its contents into the potty. Tell them the potty is where the ""poop"" and ""pee-pee"" goes. Alternatively, you can put the contents of the nappy in the toilet and let them wave goodbye as it flushes away.


You can also demonstrate how the toilet is used by bringing the child into the bathroom with you when you need to go. Have them sit on the potty as you sit on the toilet and show them how it's done. With any luck, this will encourage them to use the potty like a ""big boy"" or ""big girl"".
If possible, little boys might be better off going to the bathroom with Daddy, to avoid being! However, you should forget about teaching boys to pee standing up just yet, as this can be confusing for them (not to mention messy). For now, have them sit on the potty for number ones as well as number twos!

, Let your child get accustomed to the potty by letting them sit on it for five minutes, three times a day. Encourage them to go, but don't worry if they don't. Praise them for trying and let them know that they can try again later.


If they're impatient to get off, try reaching into that potty basket for some entertainment.
To create a potty basket or box, find a small box or basket that is at least one foot (12 inches) long, and half a foot (6 inches) wide. Borrow 2-3 potty books from your local library to place in the potty basket/box. An electronic device with potty apps, movies, videos, and songs on it will also entertain, although the use of this should be limited to one hour a day. Make sure that your child's drink-and-wet doll with a cup and possibly a potty of his/her own is in the basket: your child can make the doll ""go"" in the toilet and can make them feel proud of ""teaching"" their doll to use the toilet. A few extra pairs of underwear or training pants is helpful in case of accidents and a pack of flushable wipes is great for your child to wipe better and helps give a better clean after accidents. A sippy cup of water will help your child go and a coloring picture on a clipboard with crayons attached makes for even more entertainment. Of course, paper towels are helpful for cleaning up messes, and potty flashcards can be lifesavers.
Never force your child to sit on the potty if they don't want to - you'll only cause further resistance which can upset the whole training process.

, Try not to confuse your child by using vague or obscure words to describe the act of using the toilet or the names of particular body parts. Use easy, straight-forward, child-friendly words like ""pee"", ""poop"" and ""potty"" when speaking to your child.


Never use words like ""dirty"" or ""disgusting"" to describe natural bodily processes, as this can cause your child to feel ashamed or embarrassed about their actions, which can negatively-impact the potty training process.If a child feels anxious or embarrassed about using the potty, they can start to hold everything in - which can lead to health problems such as constipation and urinary tract infections. For this reason, it is very important that a child feels comfortable with using the potty.Being open with your child will give them confidence and let them know that they should feel proud of themselves for using the potty correctly.

, Children can feel extremely anxious about using the potty for a variety of reasons - if they are using the toilet they can be afraid of falling in or scared of the flushing noise that the toilet makes. Other children may see their bowel movements as part of themselves, which they feel they are losing by using the potty. For this reason, it is important that you stay with your child at all times while they are on the potty, at least at first.


Smile at your child, give plenty of praise, and use a calm, soothing tone of voice at all times. You can also try singing songs or playing games with your child while they're on the potty, so they come to see potty-time as a fun activity, rather than something to be feared.

, Many parents have found books dealing with the subject of potty training to be an extremely helpful tool in teaching their child how and why they should use the potty. These books are often humorous and encouraging, with engaging pictures which children can relate to.


Get your child involved in the reading process by asking questions and getting your child to point out certain items in the pictures. Then once you've finished reading, ask your child if they'd like to try using their potty, just like the little boy or girl in the book.
Some popular potty-related books include ""Once Upon A Potty"" by Alona Frankel, ""Everyone Poops"" by Taro Gomi, and ""I Want My Potty"" by Tony Ross., If you can learn to read the signs that your child needs to use the bathroom, then you can get them to the bathroom quickly and encourage them to use the potty instead of going in their diaper.


Common signals that a child needs to use the bathroom include: a change or pause in activity; squatting; clutching at their diaper; grunting; turning red in the face.
You can help your child to recognize these signs themselves by asking them ""Do you need to use the potty?"" or ""Do you need to poop?"" as soon as you notice the warning signs. Encourage your child to tell you whenever they feel like they need to go.
Be aware that some children will be reluctant to stop what they're doing, especially if they are playing and having fun, just to use the potty. You will need to encourage them and give them lots of praise to make it seem worth their while!

, Many parents recommend the technique of removing a child's diaper and letting them run around the house naked for a couple of hours a day. They will enjoy the feeling, while also learning to recognize their body's ""need-to-go"" signals, without the safety net of a diaper.


Be aware that you will have accidents if you decide to employ this method - but an accident (or five) may be just what your child needs to realize the importance of using the potty!
Don't act cross or disappointed when your child has an accident - just clean it up calmly and reassure your child that they'll make it to the potty on time next time. If you scold them, they may become anxious about using the potty and start holding.
Many parents dislike using pull-up diapers because they are now so absorbent that a child cannot tell if it is wet or not. Without some feeling of discomfort, they will not be able to learn their body's signals and make it to the bathroom on time. If the child is naked, or wearing cloth underwear however, there will be no mistaking the need to go!, Using the potty needs to become a normal and natural daily activity for your child, and the best way to make this happen is to incorporate potty time into their pre-existing daily routine.


Sit them on the potty after they brush their teeth each morning, or before their nightly bath. Do this every day and night, without fail, and your child will soon be hopping on the potty all by themselves!

, Instruct your child on how to wipe themselves properly with toilet paper before they hop off the potty. Make it easier for them by always leaving a roll of toilet paper (maybe the decorated kind!) beside the potty. This is particularly important for girls in particular, who should wipe from front to back to avoid spreading bacteria.They will probably still need help wiping for some time, especially after a number two, but is good to get your child into the habit of trying.
Once they are done, let your child do the honors of flushing the toilet and wave goodbye or cheer as everything gets flushed away. Congratulate your child on a job well done!

, Children are usually impatient to get back to the important business of playtime once they are finished with the potty, but you must make sure to emphasize how important it is for your child to wash their hands before leaving the bathroom.


To encourage hand washing, get your child a step stool so they can easily reach the sink and buy some children's anti-bacterial soap in a bright color that they will enjoy using.
Teach your child to sing a song while they wash, so they will not be tempted to wash too quickly. Get them to sing the alphabet when they start washing their hands and tell them they can only stop when they get to the letter Z!

, The most important thing you can do for your child during potty training is to offer endless encouragement, regardless of whether they succeed in using the potty or not. Praise them for every little success - from telling you when they need to go, to pulling down their own pants, to sitting on the toilet for a full minute. Even if they don't end up going, tell your child well done for trying and remind them that they can try again later.


Just be careful not to over-encourage your child. Offer praise in a calm voice and don't get over-excited. Being too over-the-top with your encouragement is it's own form of pressure and may cause your child to feel anxious about pleasing you.

, Many children respond well to incentives or rewards for using the potty. What kind of rewards you decide to offer will depend on both your parenting style and what your child responds to. Some ideas are outlined below.



Food: Some parents use candy as a reward for successfully using the potty. For instance, you could give your child three mini M&M's or a jelly worm every time they manage to go in the potty. Other parents are wary of offering food as a reward, as they believe it might affect their children's eating habits in future.Star Charts: Another common in motivator is for parents to create a star chart, where a child is given an additional gold star for every time they successfully use the potty. Sometimes the gold star is motivation enough in itself, while other times parents offer additional rewards if a child reaches a certain number of stars by the end of the week - such as a trip to the park or an extra story at bedtime.

Toys: Another good option is to buy a small set of toys (nothing big - maybe just a collection of toy cars or plastic animals) and let your child choose one every time they use the potty.

Piggy Bank: Some parents offer their children monetary incentives to use the potty! Put a piggy bank in the bathroom and pop a penny in every time your child uses the potty. Once it's full your child can cash it in to buy some treats, like an ice cream or a ride on the machines at the mall., A great way to encourage your child to take pride in using the potty, is to let them boast about it to a friend or family member. Make a big deal of them being able to tell Mommy or Daddy about how well they did with the potty when he or she comes home at the end of the day. Or else give grandma or Uncle Joe a heads up and let your child ring them to tell them the good news.


Getting positive, encouraging reactions from someone other than you (the potty trainer) will impress upon your child how good it feels to ""be a big boy/girl.""
Another trick parents use is to rope in a friend or family member to portray their child's hero or favorite cartoon character over the phone. It could be Dora the Explorer, Spiderman or Barney the Dinosaur - whoever your child likes. Telling their hero about their potty training successes and getting praised in return will make them feel proud as punch!

, Scolding and giving punishments are major no-nos when it comes to potty training. Remember that your child has only recently developed the ability to recognize and control their bladder and bowel movements, and they are still getting the hang of things. They don't intentionally have accidents just to annoy you or cause you extra work.


As mentioned before, scolding a child for having an accident or failing to use the potty can cause them to develop anxiety around the whole issue. This anxiety may cause them to start trying to hold everything in, which just causes further accidents and may lead to both health and psychological problems done the line.If your child has an accident reassure them that it's okay and that they will make it to the potty next time round. Let them know that you're proud of them for trying and that you're confident that they will soon be using the potty just like a big boy or girl.

, Potty training can be a stressful and frustrating time for parents, but remember that it is only temporary and your child will get the hang of it sooner or later. Don't start panicking about whether your child has development issues if things aren't going well. When your child is ready, they'll pick it up just fine.


If your child just doesn't seem to be getting the hang of it, the best thing to do might be to give potty training a break for a month or two and then try again.
Remember, some kids don't become fully potty trained until they're three - and that's perfectly normal!

, Once your child is doing well and using the potty consistently you can bring them shopping to pick out some ""big boy underpants"" or ""big girl underwear"" together. They will feel so proud and grown up wearing them, it will make you smile! Let them wear the underwear at home, though you may want to continue using diapers or training pants at night or when you're on the go, as accidents will happen.


Cloth underwear will actually help your child with their training, as they will be able to tell when the underwear are wet - something which is not so easy with absorbent diapers.
They will also be so pleased with their new underwear that they will be reluctant to get them wet, and therefore more diligent about keeping them dry!

, Getting the hang of using the potty or toilet at home is one thing, but strange, unfamiliar bathrooms can be intimidating to a child and they may refuse to use them. You can overcome this, and avoid putting your child back in diapers if you're trying to phase them out, by bringing the potty with you while travelling. Potties with removable seats are great for this, as you can pop them onto the seat of any toilet to recreate your child's comfort zone!, Once your little boy has got the hang of peeing sitting down, it's time for him to master the art of doing it while standing up. Daddy can help with this one, by showing his little man how it's done. Just be aware that little boy's aim is not usually the greatest and you can expect some interesting attempts at making it into the bowl.


One great method some parents use for training their boys how to get their pee in the bowl is to put some Cheerios or Fruit Loops in the toilet bowl and tell their son to aim directly for them. This turns it into a fun game which appeals to most boys' mischievous side!, Your potty training efforts will be undermined if your child is not being encouraged to use the potty by babysitters or child minders. Take the time to talk to anybody who frequently cares for your child - whether it's grandparents or the employees at your child's day care - and politely explain how important it is that they keep up your child's potty routine.Tell them about your child's normal schedule, along with the words you use to refer to any potty-related activities, and ask them to follow the same lines. This will prevent your child from becoming confused and your potty-training routine from being disrupted.
Always send a spare change of clothes, some wipes, and a few emergency diapers or training pants with your child whenever they are away from home. This will make things easier on the caregivers and help your child to feel less embarrassed about any accidents.

, When they are dry or fairly dry most days, your child may be ready for nap and night-training. If so, invest in some bed pads (you'll want at least 3 so you can change them easily) and put one on top of the bottom sheet on your child's bed. Look for the kind that have a soft layer on top and a plastic layer underneath. When that's done, put the potty next to the bed when your child goes to bed or goes for a nap.


Leave your child's bedroom door open and encourage them to call you if they wake up needing to go. If they do, put them quickly on the potty and praise them for doing so well.
If they go in the bed, change the pad and don't make a big deal of it. Deal with it calmly and matter-of-factly and reassure your child that it's okay. Remember that children may reach the age of six before they stop having accidents at night-time.

Assess readiness.,
Commit to the process.,
Praise their effort.,
Reward them for a job well done.,
Do not punish your child for mistakes.",How to Potty Train a Deaf or Hard of Hearing Toddler1," The first step in potty training your hard of hearing child or any child is to assess if they are ready to begin the process. If your child has begun to notice when they are wet or indicates to you that they need to potty, then they could be ready. Try to potty train them by age two or three, but do not feel discouraged if they do not catch on immediately., Once your child has indicated that they are ready to begin potty training, commit to it despite any setbacks. Your child is bound to have some accidents, but don’t let up. Though your child is hard of hearing, they are still able to learn skills just like any other child.Determine what times your child is most regular and put them on the potty during those times. Don’t keep them there for more than 5-10 minutes.

, Though your child is not likely to be successful in the beginning, you should still praise them for any attempts they make. If they understand any sign language at this point, sign to them “good job.” If they have some hearing abilities, then you can verbalize your praise to them., When your child does successfully use the potty, reward them so that they will have an incentive to continue the behavior. Give them a treat, a hug, or let them watch their favorite show for a bit., Understand that during these initial phases, your child will likely have several accidents. Though you may feel frustrated when these occur, do not lash out in anger or punish them. Communicate to them what they did wrong, clean up the mess, and move on.Tell or sign to them “Alexandra, you are not supposed to potty in your bed. Now we have to go to the bathroom to clean you up. Only potty in the toilet.”

Procure a plastic tub large enough for your toddler to sit in.,
Fill it with a small amount of warm water, and offer plastic cups and spoons.,
Make a bubble bath or bring out bubble wands while the child is in the tub.,
Add a few drops of food coloring into a fairly large container of water to fascinate your toddler.,
Use plastic condiment bottles to fill with water and squirt at others.

,
Set up the water hose next to the tub, and allow your toddler to play with the trickle of water coming from the end.

",How to Amuse a Toddler1,";
, Show the child how to fill the cup using the spoon. Older toddles might enjoy using a funnel to fill the cups or bottles.

, Straws that they can blow into and produce bubbles are always fun, but only allow the older toddlers to do that.

, Make up several cups or bottles of different colored water and let the toddler experiment while in the tub.

Plan potty training around the child’s needs.,
Lead the potty training yourself.",How to Potty Train a Resistant Child," Your child may feel that they don’t have enough control in the situation, which is why they are resisting you. Instead of you setting the pace, try letting your child do this. Watch their potty habits from a distance and see if you can’t figure out why your child is resisting potty training.Observe if they will train on their own without your involvement. If so, ask yourself why they are doing better without you and adjust your behaviors/attitudes accordingly.
They may stop visiting the potty altogether if you leave them to their own devices, but this probably means that they are not ready. Backing off of potty training altogether might be a good idea if this happens.;
, Look at how you are handling potty training. Are you irritated with how long it is taking? Any negative behavior on your part can stall the potty training process. If you don’t like potty training, your child probably won’t either.


Instead, maintain a positive, happy attitude towards bathroom time. Make a celebration or game out of it.
Control your response when accidents happen. Instead of lecturing your child with irritation or chiding, act like it is not a problem.

, Sometimes children resist potty training because they tend toward an independent mindset, and the commanding tone of parents makes them feel confined. If this is your toddler, switch to suggestive words instead of commanding or directive ones.Ask your toddler questions about potty time rather than just bossing them. Say, “Don’t you want to get on the fun potty and watch your pee-pee go bye-bye?” instead of, “Go to the bathroom now.”

, Most children love routine, and the younger they are, the more they love it. They may be resisting because they don’t know when to expect their next potty visit. Instead of telling your child to go the bathroom, make up a bathroom schedule. Suggest a potty break throughout the day regulated by sleeping and eating habits.Tell your child that you are going to visit the potty right after they wake up, right before they eat, right before nap, right after nap, etc. Eventually they might remind you when it’s time for their potty break.
There are many timing products on the market, like a potty watch, a potty timer with a chime, etc., to assist with reminding children when to go to the bathroom.

, Also look to yourself for how well you are accepting the things they like in the bathroom. Your child may prefer that the water be on in the sink or tub while they are pottying, or perhaps they like the window open or to have a wad of toilet paper in their hand while they go. If you are resisting their desires out of inconvenience to you, this may be making them resistant in return.


Pay attention to what they are asking for when in the bathroom. If it is a reasonable request—ie, it won’t hurt them or your appliances and plumbing—give it to them.
Be sure to tell other caretakers about this preference.

, In the end, if none of these tactics work, your child may be resisting simply because they aren’t ready. Even though you are ready, you have to be aware of your child’s needs. You may need to get the diapers back out for a few more months.

, Go shopping with your child to introduce the concept of potty training to your child. Allowing them to pick out supplies will help them feel involved and have a specific memory to mark the beginning of the process. Let them pick out the training potty, the potty seat insert that fits on top of the adult potty, and the pattern of their new underwear.

, Also called positive reinforcement, a rewards system can be a big motivator toward getting your child’s waste in the toilet. If you haven’t tried this already, you can choose to reward your child after they use the potty with a number of things:


A song
A dance
A healthy but special snack
A sticker
A favorite activity like a TV show, coloring, an outing, etc.

, Allowing children to do to their toys what you are having them do helps them feel in control. Choose a favorite doll or stuffed animal and help your child to “potty train” that toy. If you do this before you start potty training, this will familiarize your child with the process so that it is not foreign when you start.

, Reading books about potty time can help children understand what is happening. Some books are published with sound effects like clapping to help the child feel that potty time is a celebration. If you select a book like this, repeat the celebration sound when your child goes to the potty themselves.Cartoons or other instructional videos for toddlers can help them associate the potty with positive thoughts. Favorite shows like Daniel Tiger and Sesame Street have segments that focus on toilet training.

, Allow your child to come to the bathroom with you or an older sibling on a regular basis. This will show them how it is done, and help them understand that they are not alone. It can also be a motivator because they may want to be like the adult or older sibling.

, If you are going to stop diapers and start either bare bottom or training pants/underwear on a specific day, show your child a pile of last diapers. Talk about it every time you change their diaper, and point out how the stack is shrinking. This creates a countdown of anticipation, helping your child get excited about potty training., Try: ""The Potty Movie."" Some potty apps are also ""Time to Potty,"" Babybus's ""Toilet Training,"" and ""Potty Time"" by Two Little Hands., There are methods that suggest you can achieve potty training in a day. There are strict rules about how to accomplish this, and they include training a doll first, using a rewards system, running practice drills, and acting out the proper way to do potty time right after an accident.Dr. Phil, TV’s psychologist talk show host, recommends the fast-track method.
The method takes an average of four hours and involves a few steps.First, you show your child how to potty train with a doll. You put a diaper on the doll, then use the doll to demonstrate what you will do wit the child, including checking to see if the diaper is dry (which gets a reward), getting the doll to drink water, then taking the doll to the bathroom, removing the diaper, and letting the doll urinate (which gets another reward). Then the doll has an ""accident,"" and the doll is over-corrected by carrying out the whole routine again.
You repeat this process over and over until the child understands, which takes about an hour. Then you perform this process with the actual child, giving them things like salty snacks to induce thirst. When their diaper is dry when they get to the toilet, they get a treat. When they pee in the potty, they get a treat. When they have an accident, you over correct by having them act out how they should have gone to the bathroom.
The whole system is based on rewards and overcorrection,



, After your child is 30 months old, you can try a technique that involves letting your child run around the house without any clothes from the waist down (including no dresses for girls, so that sitting on the potty can be instant). This technique means blocking off 3 days for intensive potty training and being prepared for accidents.Although this technique doesn’t have scientific backing, book authors report high success rates.Pick 3 days when both parents are available, like a weekend. For the first day, the child may not understand what is going on, and are simply excited that they get to be naked. When they start to eliminate, pick them up quickly and place them on the toilet to show them how it works. The next day, you may take them outside with loose-fitting pants on (but no diaper or underwear) for an hour. The third day, you may repeat this pants situation on a driving outing for an hour. By the third day, the child usually understands the concept and wants to use the potty.
One downside is that the child may only be “naked” potty trained and not understand that underwear also means they should go to the potty first. Some authors recommend keeping the bare bottom system going for three months so that the child has time to forget what a diaper feels like, and then they won’t associate underwear with going in their pants.

, This technique orientates potty training around when the child is ready, not necessarily the parent. Wait until your child shows all the signs of being ready to potty train. If your child reacts even a little negatively, you stop the process and try again in a few days or weeks. There is no schedule you should follow or timeline you should expect this to happen in.The signs of being ready to train include being able to follow easy directions, remaining dry for more than 2 hours during the day, being dry after a nap, having regular bowel movements, can pull down their pants, dislikes dirty diapers, and has an interest in the potty.You also want to make sure they are physically and mentally in a good place, such as not having digestive issues (like diarrhea or constipation), experiencing no new life changes, and in a cooperative (as opposed to rebellious) phase.There are a few steps to follow here. One, pick out a potty with your child so they feel they are part of the process. Two, show your child how to sit on the potty, fully dressed. Three, show your child how their bowel movements can be dumped into the potty and flushed away, and how to wash their hands. The final steps include letting your child run around without a diaper, placing the potty in an easy-access place, and making sure the child thinks that the potty is their idea, not yours., Instead of waiting until your child shows signs of being ready for potty training, show your child how to get ready a few months before you plan to focus on potty training. This includes allowing the child to pick out their own potty seat and leaving it in a room where the child spends a lot of time. Then gradually start taking them to the potty at particular times of day and employ other potty tactics like the reward system, letting them sit on the potty for several minutes, etc.Don’t do too many practice potty times, or your child is likely to miss the point and start to resist voiding. Stop after one or two months.
It can take up to 6 months for this type of potty training to fully work.

Teach them signs for important potty language.,
Teach other potty hygiene signs.,
Accept any gesture as a sign.,
Purchase books.",How to Potty Train a Deaf or Hard of Hearing Toddler2," Teach your child signs for words like “wet,” “dry,” “pee,” “poop,” or “need to go.” Use these signs each time you go to the restroom and when your child goes as well so they begin to understand their meaning. Sign “wet” when you change their diaper or “need to go” after lunch when they typically potty. Be consistent until they get the meaning of it., In addition to learning basic potty words, teach them other potty related terms as well. Terms like “wash hands” will be useful for your child to know and will help them establish an understanding of bathroom hygiene., Though you may have taught them these signs for them to use to signify when they need to potty, realize that when they need to potty, their brain might override that sign and they might signal with another gesture. Accept any gesture and praise them for informing you, especially if they make it to the potty without having an accident. Allow your child to communicate with you in whatever way they can., Another way to use language to communicate to your child via language is to use books.

, Though your child may not be able to hear you, they can often make sense of the world easily by using visuals. Create a chart, picture, or flash cards that depict the pottying process for your child. The first step might be for them to remove their underwear, then sit on the potty, then pee or poop, and then put on their clothes again and wash their hands., One way to help potty train your hard of hearing child is to make a game of the process. Put a ping pong ball or some other eye catching object that you don’t mind dirtying up in the toilet. Have your child aim at it by peeing on it. Though this exercise will work best for boys, some parents of girls might find it useful, as well."

You may wish to place a sturdy step-stool next to the bed if your child needs a bit more help getting on and off the mattress.;
, A wood frame will be the sturdiest bed, but if you choose a metal frame, check the joints to make sure the screws are secure. You want to be certain the bed can’t wobble or break while your child is sleeping or climbing in and out of bed., Look for round edges when the frame is made of wood or metal. There should not be parts on the bed or the frame that jut out. This will prevent your child from getting jabbed by any sharp edges., Because some paints may contain chemicals that cause harmful or allergic reactions, you don’t want your child chewing on the bed frame or otherwise putting the frame in his or her mouth.


Look for a natural paint or finish and low volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which are organic compounds that easily become vapors or gases and contain elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, sulfur, or nitrogen.
If you paint the bed frame yourself, opt for dark or pastel colors, which will help your child sleep better without being overly stimulated.

, This will ensure that a child prone to tossing and turning can’t roll out of bed. It is important that you install guardrails on both sides of the bed, even if the bed is against a wall, to prevent the child from becoming wedged between the wall and mattress.Make sure the guard rails are flush with the mattress.

, You should choose a mattress that will fit the frame, preferably a crib-sized mattress. The mattress should be fire retardant as well. It is better to choose a firm mattress so the child can't sink into it and potentially suffocate., A child can become trapped if the mattress is too short or causes a gap. Your child will be accustomed to sleeping in a crib-sized mattress, which will make the transition to the toddler bed that much easier.

Say goodbye to diapers!",How to Potty Train a Child at Night," Do this well before potty training at night. Potty training at night is a more complicated process for your child to achieve successfully. If you'd like, for the time being, you may end up putting them in (full-blown) diapers during the night while potty-training them during the day.;
, Put it near their bed in case they need night some extra lighting. Alternatively, you can leave a hallway or bathroom light on to help them out. You don't want a fear of the dark to keep them from success.



Glow sticks can be gaudy, and don't last for too many nights. Therefore, save your cash and don't buy them for use. (Yes, you can save them in the refrigerator, but with a glow stick's life cycle, but doing so is unnecessary.)

, With the idea that some children have that toilet training at night is tougher to achieve, the child may overreact and have accidents, during the day. For a few days, during nighttime training prepare your child a few disposable potty-training pants for daytime use.

, Such brands include Goodnites (or DryNites in Europe) or one of the many store-brand disposable bedwetting diapers. These will help for both the parents (from extra wetting the floor) as well as giving the child the feeling they want (wicking away moisture), should the child have an accident while trying to walk to the bathroom in time during the night.

, Have the child help with preparing these stickers - the fun part is the art of preparation! Line them up in the direction you want the child to walk at night, and explain that these stickers help guide your child's way.


Make sure that the glowing stickers have had some light exposed to them at first before the child begins to fall asleep. If you can, use an always-on nightlight near these glowing stickers to ensure they will stay glowing when they are most needed each night.

, Explain to them that now that they know the process during the day, they just have to work on it at night. Reassure them that some mistakes are okay, and that they shouldn't be worried. Focus on what a grown-up step it is to use the toilet, and get them excited about the idea of getting to wear fun new underwear once they can stay dry.


Explain also to them that you will be there to help, as needed. If they're old enough and want to, they can take care of their bathroom needs by themselves at night, but also reassure them that you're available for help if they need it.

, Pick pajamas that can be removed quickly and easily on those nights.


Even a onesie can be considered an easy-to-remove piece of clothing, once the child realizes where the snaps are that hold the clothing shut.

, Listen out to what's going on during the night. . If you hear the child going to the bathroom alone, that's great! If they have an accident or are distressed about the process, provide them with the support they need. The transition isn't always easy, and it helps to be supportive and understanding, especially for young children who are younger than 3 or 4.


For a little peace of mind, provide a nursery monitor in both the child's bedroom (the transponder) as well as in the master bedroom where you sleep (the receiver) , to make sure you don't ""skip a beat!""

, These will happen! Have your child help, at an age-appropriate level, in doing a little cleanup afterwards. This isn't a punishment and shouldn't be arduous. You can do any of the messier cleanup, but consider having your child change their own clothes and put the soiled clothes in the hamper, or throw away the night-time diapers they might have soiled that night. That way, they are exposed to some natural consequences of having accidents, which will reinforce the benefits of staying dry.

, Reinforce their success! Get excited with them when they stay dry overnight - make it fun!


If your child is really struggling with motivation when it comes to potty-training, you might consider a reinforcement schedule. Provide a sticker for each dry night, and let them know that once they have three or four stickers, they can pick out a little toy or get a fun trip to the playground. Match the reward to your child's wants and needs, and make it something fun.

, If they're doing well, remove the daytime potty-training pants after a period of about two weeks, and remove the nighttime bedwetting diapers/pants after a period of three weeks of success.


Always remove the bedwetting diaper once the morning arises. You may feel safe enough to use regular underpants on your little ones, but sometimes nighttime training may cause daytime accidents for a few days. Use a pair of potty-training pants in the daytime, such as Pull-Ups or the store brand variety, if needed.

, Dispose of all disposable diapers you may have already, and bring any of the unused diapers to places who may now be in need of them. Such places include daycare centers and preschools.

However, most parents don't start to potty train their children until they're 2 1/2 to 3 years old, when their bladders and bowel movements are more reliable. Here are a few signs that your boy is ready for potty training:Look for the physical signs. If your boy is ready to be potty trained, then he should urinate a healthy amount at once, have pretty predictable and formed bowel movements, and should be able to stay dry for at least two hours during naps. He should also be coordinated enough to walk and run without difficulty.

Look for the behavioral signs. If your son is ready to be potty trained, he should be able to easily pull his pants up and down and sit down in one position for at least two minutes. He should also show that he's having a bowel movement, such as by grunting or just telling you, and he should show a distaste for the feeling of a dirty diaper. He should also express an interest in other people's bathroom habits.







Look for the cognitive signs. He should understand what going to the bathroom means and have words for it, and should be able to follow your directions. He should also be able to recognize the physical signs of having to use the bathroom before it happens.





;
, If you're serious about potty-training your boy, then you should get him his own potty so he can feel more comfortable and independent. Many boys are scared to use the regular toilet because they're afraid of falling in and don't feel steady, so pick a potty where your boy can comfortably sit with his feet touching the ground.Decide whether or not you want a potty with a urine guard. The urine guard will protect your floor from a few extra splashes of urine, but it could also hurt your boy's penis, and may lead him to have uncomfortable associations with the potty. Some potties have removable urine guards, so you can opt for one of those if you're not sure.
Pick a bright, friendly color -- even your boy's favorite -- so the potty is a more inviting item.

, Introduce the potty before making your child use it. Place it in a play area, so your boy can sit on it and play around it while he gets used to the potty. You can even personalize it by having your boy put stickers on it, or even write his name on the potty with stickers.


Let your boy practice sitting on it with his clothes on from time to time. After he's gotten comfortable with the idea of the potty after one or two weeks, you can move forward with the process.

, Begin potty training your son by allowing him to go to the bathroom with his daddy so he can see the process. Daddy can even ask if he wants to try too. Don't pressure your child; just give him the option so he knows that he is in control of using the restroom.

It's likely that your boy has wanted to do other things his father could do in the past, so this should be no different. His father should treat it like a cool, grown up privilege, and your boy will be even more excited about the process.







, Potty training should be scheduled so that you are focused on the project and your little one knows what to expect. Plan on spending as much time as possible at home for the first few days. It is very difficult to potty train on the road or while running errands. If you do have to go somewhere, take a little potty in the car with you for emergency situations.


Pick a time that is relatively stress-free for you and your boy. For example, if you've just introduced a new pet to the family, or you've just moved to a new neighborhood, it may be best to put off potty training for a few weeks until your son is comfortable in his environment again.

, There are two main training plans for your boy: you can either switch back and forth between diapers or disposable training pants and underpants, or just go ""cold turkey"" and use underwear full-time, even if your boy is still having accidents. There are advantages and disadvantages to both:If you just make your boy wear underwear all the time, he may be trained more quickly because he'll be able to tell if he's wet right away and will feel more uncomfortable than he would in diapers. The downside is that you'll have to clean up lots of accidents.






If you go back and forth, then your son will slowly ease into the potty training process. If your son's in preschool, then his teachers may also prefer that he's still in diapers when he's potty training, though you should have a conversation about it.You can also stick to diapers at night and during long car trips, and underwear during the day.

, You should first teach your boy to poop and pee sitting down so that he gets comfortable in this position. Tell him to push his penis straight down before he sits down so that he avoids scraping it on the splash guard if you have one, and so it's aimed in the right place. If your son hasn't been circumcised, teach him to keep his foreskin retracted while he pees. If he doesn't, the foreskin will cause the pee to spray out and make a huge mess, as well as trap urine residue which can lead to an infection.Teach him to wipe himself after he has a bowel movement. You can start by doing this yourself and asking for a little help, and gradually teach him to do it on his own.
Once he's comfortable using the bathroom sitting down, you can teach him to pee when he's standing. He should be positioned right in front of the potty with his feet slightly apart. You can throw a few cheerios or goldfish in the bowl to make the process more fun and give him something to aim at.
You can make your boy more comfortable with the potty if you give him something to read while he's using the bathroom.







, While your son is potty training, you should give him some time to just play near the potty without any clothes on. This will make him feel more comfortable with his potty, and much more likely to use it. Being naked will make going to the potty feel like a more natural process for your son, and like a lot less work.

Encourage your son to sit on the potty, even if he doesn't need to use it. This will make him feel more comfortable with it.






Be prepared for some accidents. If he's playing without pants on, he's more likely to have an accident. This may be a pain, but remember that the less time your boy spends without diapers on, the more quickly he'll be fully potty trained.

, Potty training your boy can be a long and frustrating processes filled with accidents and uncomfortable cleanup. But that's OK -- you can't control whether or not your boy has an accident. What you can control is your reaction to his mistakes. Make sure to stay positive, and not to berate him or be mean if he didn't use the potty every time.

Use positive reinforcement to keep your boy on the right path, instead of being negative. If you're negative about his accidents, he will feel ashamed and insecure, and will lose the confidence he needs to be potty trained.






Remember that potty training for any child can be traumatic. For a little child, it's almost as if he is losing a part of himself. So be empathetic and patient during this process.

, Motivate your boy to get potty trained by talking up a trip to buy underwear. Take him shopping with you to show him all the different kinds of underwear out there, and let him choose his favorite, whether the underwear has toy trains, puppies, or spaceships on it. Tell him that once he's fully potty trained, he'll get to wear real underwear like his father or brothers all the time.


Not all boys love the feel of real underwear right away. If he doesn't like the way the underwear feels on his bare skin, let him wear it over his diapers first.

, Don't be indifferent when your boy uses the potty. Cheer, kiss him, give him a hug, and tell him what a great job he did. Make a show of calling his father or other family members to tell them what a big boy he is. Tell him you're proud of him every time he uses the potty.Remember to be consistent. If you're really excited when your boy uses the potty some days, but are too busy to give him the attention he needs other days, then he'll be confused.

, You can choose to reward with a jelly bean or gummy bear, or you can offer stickers. Give him one treat when he urinates and two when he has a bowel movement. The reward should be enough to motivate, but not too big that it becomes expensive. Throw some treats, stickers, and small toys in a basket so your child can pick something when he successfully uses the potty.

You can even keep a calendar where you stick on a sticker every time your boy successfully uses the potty during a certain day.







, Once your child is comfortable using the potty during the day, it'll be time to move into night mode. Before you start, you should make sure that your boy can stay dry for at least two hours during naps. Then start by having your boy sleep in underwear, and check to see if he's had an accident later in the night. If he can get through a night in clean underwear more than half the time, then you may slowly switch into ""underwear only"" mode.

If your boy is still having accidents in the night, don't let him get discouraged. Keep using diapers at night and tell him he'll be able to do it when he's bigger. Then slowly try again.






One reason why your child may be having accidents at night is because his bladder may be too small to hold his urine. Try limiting his fluid intake after five p.m. or so and see if that makes a difference., Once your son has completely been potty trained, it's time to get rid of your diapers -- and to celebrate! Make it clear that this is no small achievement, and tell your boy that you're very proud of him, do a little dance, and even give him his favorite treat or watch his favorite movie with him.You can also take him with you to give the remaining diapers to a family with a smaller child. This will make him feel even more grown up!

Dress your child in clothes that cover her diaper.,
Dress your child in snap crotch clothes.,
Combine layers of clothes to make it even harder for your child to reach her diaper.",How to Keep Your Toddler from Taking Their Diaper Off1," One easy way to keep a toddler from removing their diaper is to dress them in a way that makes the diaper harder to reach.


Overalls are great for this because they can have long pants or shorts which makes them usable any time during the year.
It is important to make sure that the straps over the shoulders are not so tight that they restrict movement, but are snug enough to make them difficult to get them off.;
, Another way to make the diaper inaccessible is to use a t-shirt or regular shirt that has a snap-crotch. For girls that are wearing a dress or skirt, tights can be worn over the diaper.

, If the diaper removal continues with any one of these types of clothing, they can be combined. For example, overalls and a snap-crotch shirt or tights with a snap-crotch shirt can be very confusing for a child to get past.

Give your child honey.,
Make sure your child has plenty of fluids.,
Treat croup with cool air and humidity.,
Try homeopathic remedies with caution.",How to Treat Toddler Cough Without Medication1," If your toddler is over one year old, honey is a great remedy for cough and sore throat.A spoonful before bed or throughout the day will be a treat and will ease coughing and throat pain. You can also dissolve 1-2 teaspoons of honey in hot water or tea (but be sure to let it cool down before giving it to your child).


Honey should not be given to children under one year of age.
If your child shows any signs of allergic reaction, such as swelling, hives, or lethargy, you’re your pediatrician. If more serious symptoms occur, such as difficulty breathing, call 911.;
, Children can get dehydrated quickly when they’re sick, which is dangerous. Plus staying well hydrated helps to loosen up mucus and make breathing easier.Give your child lots of cool water and juice and warm decaffeinated tea with honey and lemon. Choose warm soup like chicken noodle for mealtime – the warm liquid soothes the throat and helps to keep your child hydrated.

, You don’t have to be a doctor to be able to recognize the common cough of croup. It sounds like a barking or seal-like cough; other symptoms might be a high-pitched sound when your child breathes in, fever, hoarse voice, and difficulty swallowing.Croup is caused by a virus, so does not require antibiotics. A cool-mist humidifier or steamed up bathroom, cool soothing drinks, or short exposure to cool air outside can help reduce throat swelling and improve cough.Children usually recover from croup with no problems. As always, seek medical care if your child has difficulty breathing or a fever over 104°F (40°C).

, Homeopathy is the practice of using natural substances in small doses to treat illness.It has not been scientifically proven to be effective.However, when practiced properly and correctly, many people find it beneficial and some medical professionals support its use.There is a risk of adverse effects when using homeopathy, especially with children, and careful dosing is important.If you are interested in homeopathic remedies, consult a professional and talk with your pediatrician.


Homeopathic remedies are matched to your child’s specific symptoms and the characteristics of their illness, so pay careful attention to how your child is feeling and acting."

Cover the diaper tabs with stronger tape.,
Consider placing tape all the way around the diaper.,
Place the end of the tape at the back of the diaper.,
Leave a margin of diaper above the tape.",How to Keep Your Toddler from Taking Their Diaper Off2," Regular tape tabs on diapers are small and easy for a child to pull off with a single tug. However, covering the diaper tape tabs with stronger tape makes this more difficult.


Although it does not matter what type of tape is used, some parents prefer clear packing tape because it is not noticeable by the toddler or other people. The main thing to look for when choosing tape for this method is that it sticks very well.
It is also best if the tape is 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5.1 cm) wide so that it totally covers the diaper tabs.

, For some toddlers, putting a piece of stronger tape over each of the tabs is all that is necessary, but there are others who are only slightly deterred by this.


In these cases, it might be necessary for the parent to place a longer strip of tape all the way around the top of the diaper.

, To be sure that the toddler cannot pick at the end of the tape and remove it, the parent should make sure the end is in the back where the toddler cannot see it.

, It is also important to leave a small margin of the diaper above the tape. This keeps the tape from getting stuck to the toddler’s skin, where it can be painful to remove.

Understand the purpose of teaching your child to take off her diaper.,
Be patient.,
Set guidelines for your child.",How to Keep Your Toddler from Taking Their Diaper Off3," As odd as it might sound, being able to remove their own diaper is actually a good thing because the child will need to remove the diaper when they are potty-training.


The real issue is controlling when and where the diaper is removed. However, this is something that parents can teach their child.
Not only does it prevent messy or embarrassing moments, but teaching the child when to remove their diaper encourages self-esteem and builds on their self-help skills.

, Just as it is with teaching a child how to do other things, teaching them when it is alright to remove their diaper is going to take time and patience. They may not always get their timing right, but they should not be scolded for their misjudgment.


Instead, the parent should just go over the guidelines they have set for when the toddler is allowed to remove their diaper on their own.

, The specific guidelines for when the toddler can remove their diaper will vary from one family to another and may also depend on the age of the toddler. However, a safe way to start is to simply teach the toddler to ask if they can remove their diaper.


If the toddler is not speaking in full sentences yet, they can be taught to point at their diaper area and say “off” or even to simply tug at the waistband of the diaper.

Redirect your toddler’s attention.,
Look for signs that your child is removing the diaper because she is uncomfortable.,
Consider frustration as a cause of this particular behavior.,
Avoid punishing or yelling at your toddler.,
Act in a calm, reasonable manner.",How to Keep Your Toddler from Taking Their Diaper Off4," Unfortunately, there are some children that will still remove their diaper at inopportune times. Bribing the toddler to leave their diaper alone is not a good idea because it actually reinforces the unwanted behavior.


Instead, the parent should try to redirect the toddler’s attention to something else such as looking out a window. This will usually cause them to forget that they were about to remove their diaper.
While the toddler is distracted, the parent should take a closer look at the situation. If they can figure out why the toddler was attempting to remove the diaper, they can correct the problem and prevent unwanted diaper removal.

, The toddler may be removing their diaper due to discomfort. It might be too tight, too loose, scratchy, wet, or dirty.


Before they remove their diaper, toddlers that are uncomfortable will usually show signs that they are about to do it. They might rub, scratch, pinch, pull, or look disapprovingly at their diaper area.
The way that they walk or move might also appear different. Reading these signs and fixing the diaper problem will keep the toddler from removing it on their own.

, Since toddlers don’t have the necessary words to express themselves they will often act out because they are frustrated. For example, removal of their diaper may simply be a way of asking for some one-on-one time with the parent. They know that, no matter what the parent is doing, they will stop in order to re-diaper the toddler.


If there seems to be no other explanation for the diaper removal, giving the toddler a bit more attention may be all that is necessary to break this habit. This can be done even if the parent has a very tight schedule because it does not need to be a large chunk of time.
It can be as simple as the parent sweeping the toddler up in their arms and kissing them or getting down on their level and giving them a big hug.

, If the toddler still continues to remove their diaper, it is important for the parent to remain calm even if there is a mess to clean up.

Punishing, yelling, and threatening the toddler should be avoided because they are negative actions that the toddler is likely to end up copying.






By remaining calm, the parent does not give in to the toddler that might be removing their diaper just to see the parent’s reaction.







, The parent should keep an even tone to their voice and simply state that they love the child but do not like them removing their diaper.


If it is an older toddler, the parent can have a simple talk about the diaper-removing situation and then you can try to resolve the issue together.
If there is a mess, the parent should not make the toddler clean it up. Instead, they can have the toddler help in the process by letting them carry a roll of paper towels or cleaning rag to the scene for the parent to use.

Put a humidifier in your child’s room.,
Clean your child’s nose with saline and a bulb syringe.,
Prop your child up on pillows when they sleep.,
Soothe chapped skin with petroleum jelly.,
Keep irritants away from your child.,
Show your child extra care and attention.",How to Treat Toddler Cough Without Medication2," Humidifiers are available at many department stores and are easy to use. Cool-mist humidifiers decrease the pain of a sore throat and alleviate nighttime coughing because they keep the inside of your child’s nose and throat moist.If you don’t own a humidifier, replicate the moistening action in your bathroom. Close the door, turn the hot water on in the shower, and let the room steam up. Relax with your child in the steamy room for about 20 minutes. The soothing and moistening actions will make breathing easier and more comfortable., Young children usually do not know how to blow their nose, so you need to clean their nose for them. The saline moistens the inside of the nose and breaks up mucus a little, so that you can suction the mucus out with the bulb syringe. Tilt your child’s head back a little and use an eyedropper to squirt 1-2 drops of saline into each nostril. Squeeze the bulb, pushing the air out, and gently put the tip of the syringe into one nostril. Release the squeeze on the bulb, and mucus from the nose should get sucked into the syringe.Do this before bed and up to four times daily.
Make sure the syringe is clean before putting it in your child’s nose.

, Coughing often gets worse at night because mucus accumulates in the throat as your child is lying flat. Elevate your child’s head with a few pillows placed under their back, shoulders and neck. This can make it easier for them to sleep.For babies, prop the mattress up with pillows to avoid pillows in the crib, which can pose a suffocation risk.

, Petroleum jelly won’t help a cough, but you can make your child more comfortable by rubbing a little under their nose or on other chapped or irritated skin.

, While your child is sick, anything irritating to the nose, throat or lungs can make their cough worse. Avoid strong scents in the home like incense or air fresheners, keep pollen outside where it belongs, and do not smoke around your child. Exposure to smoke can cause asthma in children and can keep them sick for longer.Even exposure to second-hand smoke from your clothes or hair can worsen your child’s cough or breathing problems. If you do smoke, do so outside away from your child, change clothes when you come inside (or have a big overcoat you wear specifically for smoking to protect your clothes) and tie back or cover long hair to prevent it bringing smoke into the home.

, Sometimes the best way to treat a child's cough without medication is with extra love in addition to other home remedies. Your toddler will appreciate the added affection, and you will be better able to monitor changes in temperature and demeanor and act accordingly.

Check for a fever.,
Know signs of dehydration.,
Have an asthma plan.,
Pay close attention to how your child is breathing.,
Watch for a blue tinge to your child’s skin.,
Check your child’s phlegm for blood.,
Listen for a “whooping” cough.,
Know signs of pneumonia.,
Consider other reasons to seek medical attention.",How to Treat Toddler Cough Without Medication3," It’s not uncommon for children to have a low fever even with a mild illness, and children tend to run higher temperatures than adults. However, a fever of 104°F (40°C) or higher, or any fever (over 100.4 F) in a baby less than 3 months requires a call to the doctor. A fever can cause dehydration, lead to seizures, or indicate that infection is present. If your child has a high fever or one that lasts for over 5 days with home care, they should be seen by their doctor.If your child has a fever (over 100.4F) and a rash, then this is also a reason to seek medical attention for your child.

, Kids get dehydrated much faster than adults, and the consequences can be more severe. If your child exhibits signs of dehydration, take them quickly for medical care. If they cannot be rehydrated with fluids they may require an IV.


Signs of dehydration in toddlers include a dry or sticky mouth, seeming dizzy or especially sleepy, sunken in eyes, lack of tears when crying, and having fewer wet diapers or urinating less frequently., If you already know that your child has asthma, you and your doctor should work up an asthma plan, i.e. what to do in the event they have an asthma flare up. However, you may not know your child has asthma if they are at a young age. If your child is coughing and you hear them wheezing when they breathe out, it can be a sign of asthma and they should be treated by the doctor.You may also notice asthma if your child has a cough and wheezing for many, many nights, but they have no symptoms of a cold like runny nose or fever.Use a cool-mist humidifier in their room for some relief, and make sure they drink lots of fluids.

, If your child’s cough begins to interfere with their ability to breathe in any way, you should take them to the doctor quickly. You may notice that their chest or stomach is heaving because they are working hard to breathe, that they are breathing faster than usual, or that they are making a noisy or musical sound when breathing in (called stridor)., When your child isn’t breathing well and isn’t getting enough oxygen, you may start to see a blue or dusky purple color in their lips, tongue or face. This is a serious indication of breathing problems, and you should seek emergency care., It’s not typical for a child to cough up blood, so if they do you should skip at-home remedies and go to the doctor. You can, however, first check their mouth to make sure the blood isn’t from a bite on the tongue or cheek., You’ve probably heard of whooping cough, the common name for an infection with the pertussis bacteria. Pertussis infections were becoming uncommon but are on the rise due to children going unvaccinated. Pertussis infections require antibiotics to get better, so a doctor’s visit is needed. Listen for the classic presentation: many dry coughs in a row in a long coughing attack, followed by a high-pitched “whooping” sound when your child breathes in.Your child is at risk for whooping cough if they did not receive their DTaP (Diptheria-Tetanus-Pertussis) vaccine.
You can make your child more comfortable for a short time by making sure they drink lots of fluids, and using a cool-mist humidifier in their room. This is not a cure, however, and they do need medicine., Pneumonia is a medical emergency in toddlers. Seek emergency care if your child has a wet-sounding, mucus filled cough and is having a hard time breathing, has a high fever, has general achiness or chest pain, is vomiting, has chills, or shows any blue color in the skin., There may be other reasons to seek medical treatment for your child if they have a cough. Some other situations when you should seek medical attention for your child’s cough include:


Your child has a blood or immune disorder or has not received routine immunizations.
Your child is vomiting repeatedly and / or has severe diarrhea.

Recognize the symptoms of a sinus infection.,
Give your toddler acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help relieve pain and fever.,
Keep your child well hydrated.,
Give your toddler a bath.,
Use saline nose drops.,
Run a cool mist humidifier in your child's room.,
Ensure your child gets plenty of rest.,
Do not use over-the-counter decongestants and antihistamines.",How to Treat a Sinus Infection for a Toddler1," Sinus infections in children are characterized by persistent cold-like symptoms. Sinusitis can be caused by a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection.


Cold-like symptoms of sinus infections include persistent sneezing, coughing, and congestion that lasts for two weeks or more. In addition, your toddler may have green nasal discharge and sore throat.Your child may also complain of facial pain or headache that is linked to congestion and present with puffy eyes.Sinus infections often cause fevers in young children of 102°F (39°C) or higher.Chronic sinus infections consist of symptoms that last three months or longer with several episodes within a year. ;
, You can use over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications to help manage your child’s facial pain, headache, and fever associated with sinus infection.


Make sure that you are only giving your toddler the dose that is appropriate for her age and weight. Check with a nurse or your toddler’s pediatrician if you are not sure what kind of dose to give to your child.
A fever that is under 101°F (38°C) in a toddler is considered low-grade and can be treated with medication.
Keep your eye on your child if her fever is between 101°F (38°C) and 103°F (39.4°C); if it does not go down after a few hours of treating your child with OTC medication or lasts longer than three days, call your pediatrician.A fever that is 104°F (40°C) or higher and does not come down within a couple of hours after giving your toddler medication requires immediate medical attention.OTC medications that can be used to treat your child’s fever include ibuprofen (e.g., Advil) for children six months and older and acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) for infants two months and older.
Do not treat your toddler’s fever with aspirin. Aspirin should not be given to children under the age of 18 because it can cause a rare but potentially fatal disease called Reye's syndrome., Keeping your toddler hydrated helps to alleviate many of his sinus infection symptoms, including congestion, vomiting, and fever. There are a variety of ways to keep your child hydrated.Give your child cool beverages to stay hydrated. Pedialyte and Gatorade may be extra helpful by providing a boost of electrolytes.
If your child has a sore throat, a popsicle may help to ease the pain while also providing fluids.Older toddlers may also be served warm or cold caffeine-free herbal tea with honey to ease a sore throat.Please note that honey should not be given to a child under one year of age due to the risk of botulism.You can also give your sick toddler chicken soup, which is a good source of fluids and nutrients.

, Giving your toddler a bath allows can help relieve some of the symptoms of sinusitis. The steam from a warm bath can help ease congestion and loosen mucus.


Taking a lukewarm bath may also help to reduce your toddler’s fever. Make sure that the water is not hotter than 90°F (32.3°C) or too cold.Your toddler may also benefit from having a warm, moist towel over her face to help reduce facial pain and open up the sinuses., Much of your child’s discomfort comes from his packed sinuses and nasal passages. You can help release mucus by using saline nose drops and suction.


Use salt water nose drops to help thin mucus in your child’s sinuses. Put drops into his nostrils according to the directions on the packaging.Use a bulb syringe to suction off the mucus.

, Extra moisture in the air helps to thin the mucus in your child’s sinuses and nasal passages. Running a cool mist humidifier overnight can help relieve pressure and ensure a better sleep.Make sure you keep the humidifier clean and dry to keep mold and bacteria from spreading through the air.

, As with any illness, your child needs plenty of rest in order to fight off a sinus infection. Make sure that your child has a comfortable place to sleep and that he rests during the day.


If your child is restless, give him quiet entertainment such as an interactive video or low-energy toys to play with.Keep your child out of daycare so that he does not spread the infection.

, Avoid giving your toddler OTC decongestants and antihistamine medications if she is under the age of four. Generally, these medications are not effective at treating sinus infections in young toddlers and are easy to overdose.


OTC decongestants and antihistamine medications, such as Claritin and Benadryl, are not effective at treating upper respiratory infections, especially those caused by bacteria.Talk to your doctor before giving any OTC medication to give your child. Your child's doctor can advise on allergy medications if your child has allergies along with a sinus infection.

Look for signs of the common cold.,
Monitor your child's appetite and energy level.,
Take your child's temperature.,
Consider when your toddler's signs appeared.,
Know when to get medical attention for your toddler.",How to Tell a Cold from Flu in Toddlers1," Although runny nose, dry throat, and mild body aches are also signs of the flu, your child might show distinctive signs of a cold. You might notice your toddler sneezing or coughing more. Their eyes may also water if they have a cold.It can be hard to determine, but if your child has mild headaches, they may have the common cold.;
, If your toddler appears to be unwell, pay attention to how much food their eating at meals and during snack times. If your child has a normal appetite, they probably have a cold. You should also see if your child plays, explores, and interacts with others or if they're too tired to function normally. If your child doesn't seem bothered or overly tired, they most likely have a cold.Ensure that your child is getting enough fluids, if you suspect they have a cold. This will help thin the mucous that they're coughing up or sneezing.

, Small kids that haven't been exposed to as many viruses may develop fevers to fight common colds. Use a digital thermometer to take your child's temperature to see if they're running any fever. A low-grade fever (99 to 100.9°F/37.3 to 38.3°C) probably means they have a cold.Continue monitoring your child's temperature to ensure the fever doesn't get higher.

, Think back to when your child began feeling unwell. If the signs of illness have been coming on gradually, your toddler probably has a cold. For example, your toddler might have first complained of a sore throat or runny nose. Within a few days, they may show other signs, like a stuffed up nose or cough.Most kids get colds during the winter season (or rainy season, if you live somewhere temperate), but colds can happen year-round.

, Keep track of how long your child has had signs of a cold. There is no special treatment for a cold — you should monitor their symptoms and keep them comfortable while the cold runs its course. Most colds will resolve within a week. Your child might have one or two signs of a cold that last a little longer, but the main cold signs should clear up within seven days. If your child's cold still seems bad after a week or seems to be getting worse, contact their doctor. You should also get medical attention if:Your toddler seems lethargic or tired all the time.
Your toddler wakes up with swollen eyes that are covered with pus.
Your toddler has trouble breathing, has blue lips, or chokes or vomits from coughing so much.
Your toddler has a fever above 100.4°F (38°C) for more than three to four days.
Your toddler complains of ear pain.

Take your toddler to the pediatrician.,
Ask if your child has an acute or chronic sinusitis.,
Ask the pediatrician whether your child needs antibiotics.,
Consider allergy tests or treatment for your child.,
Ask your doctor if your toddler needs surgery for chronic sinusitis.",How to Treat a Sinus Infection for a Toddler2," If your toddler is not feeling better after a few days or his condition worsens, seek medical attention. Your child’s pediatrician can diagnose the cause of sinusitis and prescribe medication if needed.


The pediatrician may perform an examination to see if your child has sinusitis, such as looking in the nasal cavity for polyps, shining a light through a sinus to look for signs of inflammation, or performing a nasal culture.She will also check your child's ears, throat and lungs.

, Your child may suffer from acute or chronic sinusitis, depending on the severity and duration of his infection. The doctor can help make the distinction and treat it accordingly.Chronic sinusitis tends to last 12 or more weeks or causes recurring infections four to six times in one year.
Acute sinusitis typically lasts only a few weeks and the symptoms tend to be more severe within that short span of time., Your toddler may require antibiotics in order to treat her sinusitis. Antibiotics are can be used to treat bacterial sinus infections but are not effective on viral infections.The pediatrician is likely to prescribe antibiotics after your child has been ill for longer than 10 days, as this is a sign of a bacterial infection versus a viral infection.If your child is prescribed a course of antibiotics, the medication should be taken as directed by your child’s doctor and no doses should be skipped even when your child begins to feel better., If your child has symptoms suggestive of allergies or known allergic triggers, then allergy testing or treatment may be in order. Children with allergies are more likely to have problems with sinus infections.

, In extreme causes of recurrent or chronic sinusitis, the best course of action may be surgery. Your pediatrician can advise you about whether this is right for your toddler.


Surgery is considered as the best option when your child has multiple episodes of sinusitis that cannot be relieved with medication therapy.A surgery generally consists of removing some of the tissue near the sinuses in order to allow mucus to move more freely."

Learn what causes sinusitis in toddlers.,
Know the risk factors for sinusitis.,
Learn how to prevent sinusitis.",How to Treat a Sinus Infection for a Toddler3," Understanding the mechanism behind sinusitis can help you gain a better appreciation of how to treat its symptoms. You may also be able to keep your toddler from contracting it.


Acute sinusitis is typically caused by a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that causes the sinuses to swell up, leaving mucus trapped and increasing pressure in the sinuses.Chronic sinusitis may be caused either by a severe infection or by structural abnormalities in the sinuses such as polyps or bone spurs, or abnormalities of the cilia that keep them from ushering mucus out of the sinuses.Allergic rhinitis is another risk factor for chronic or recurring sinus infections.

, Reduce your child’s risk of contracting sinusitis by educating yourself about the risk factors. You can take control of your child’s environment to help decrease her likelihood of suffering from a sinus infection.


If your child is immunosuppressed, she is more likely to contract an infection. To support a healthy immune system, give your toddler a nutritious diet and plenty of rest.Teach your toddler how to reduce risk of illness by following a proper hygiene at daycare or school. For example, ask for your toddler to wash her hands before eating a snack and after using the restroom.Keep your child’s respiratory tract healthy by keeping her away of smoky environments.Never take your toddler to school or daycare when she is sick in order to prevent the spread of illness.

, Armed with an understanding of what causes sinusitis, you can take steps to prevent it. Making small changes can improve your child’s health.


When the air is dry in your home, especially if you are running the heater, use a humidifier to help your child breathe easy.Take care of your child’s cold and flu symptoms early before the illness turns into a sinus infection. This can include preventative measures such as getting a flu shot and other routine childhood immunizations.Make sure that your child washes his hands thoroughly and often, especially when playing with other children, in order to decrease his risk of contracting an infection."

Pay attention to signs of influenza.,
Think about when the signs appeared.,
Check your toddler for fever.,
Pay attention to your child's appetite.,
Know when to get medical attention.",How to Tell a Cold from Flu in Toddlers2," In addition to cold symptoms like sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and muscle aches, your toddler may develop a higher fever, cough, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These are all signs of possible influenza in small children.Your toddler may seem very tired or lethargic if they have the flu, but might have normal energy levels if they have a common cold.

, Influenza symptoms usually appear quickly. A high fever is one of the first signs and it may last for one to five days. You'll also notice your toddler develop stomach problems (nausea, vomiting, etc.) and a few days later they may start to show signs of a respiratory illness (coughing, sore throat, and headache).Your child's activity level will also drop off dramatically. For example, your toddler might be fine one day and wake up the next day with a high fever. They may be lethargic for the rest of the day, not even wanting to play.
Flu season is usually from November to April, peaking in January, February, or March.

, Take your child's temperature using a digital thermometer to see if they're running a fever. While a low fever can indicate a common cold, a high fever between 102 to 106°F (38.9 to 41°C) can mean influenza.Young children are more likely to have higher temperatures when they're fighting the flu than adults do.

, Your toddler may suddenly stop eating food, even foods they usually enjoy. If you can't seem to get your toddler to eat anything, they may have the flu. This is especially true if your child has other stomach problems like nausea, diarrhea or vomiting.Ensure that your toddler is getting plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Offer milk, juice, water, Pedialyte, or broth to keep your toddler hydrated.

, If you suspect your toddler has influenza, it's a good idea to call their doctor right away. The doctor may want to examine your child to make the diagnosis. If your child is under two or has certain medical conditions (such as asthma or diabetes), the doctor may give them an anti-viral medication to reduce the severity of the symptoms (remember that there is no cure for the flu). You should also call the doctor or go to the emergency room if your toddler:Has a temperature over 103° F (39.4°C).
Is extremely irritable (can't get comfortable or doesn't want to be held)
Has a severe headache or stiff neck
Isn't taking enough fluids
Has a rash and a fever
Seems confused or has trouble breathing
Has blue-tinted skin
Seems to improve, but then worsens

"
"
Take your child to the doctor.,
Give them children's pain or fever relief medication.,
Keep your child hydrated.,
Make your child comfortable.",How to Tell a Cold from Flu in Toddlers3," If your child has a lingering cold (that lasts over a week), call the pediatrician's office. Ask the doctor what medications or other treatments you can give your toddler to make them more comfortable. If your child has the flu, the doctor may want to see them in order to make a diagnosis and prescribe any medications.


Don't be afraid to call the doctor's office and describe symptoms that your toddler has. If you're still unsure if your toddler has the flu or a cold, it's best to get a medical diagnosis.

, If your toddler has a cold, you can give them over-the-counter pain relief (like ibuprofen or acetaminophen) to relieve some cold symptoms (like headache, general aches and pains, and fever). Follow the dosing instructions based on your child's weight and age. Ensure that you only give your child children's pain relief medication.


Avoid giving your toddler aspirin. Aspirin in children has been linked to Reye's Syndrome, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition., Regardless of if your toddler has the flu or a cold, they need to be getting fluids to replace the fluids they're losing by coughing, sneezing, or vomiting. Offer your child plenty of water, broth, and juice to prevent the risk of dehydration. If your child is refusing all fluids, contact the doctor since dehydration can develop quickly.


You can also try giving your toddler fruit-juice popsicles to suck on.

, If your toddler is congested or has a cough, you may want to set up a cool-mist humidifier in their room. Run the humidifier at night when they're trying to sleep so it's easier for them to breathe and fall asleep. Keep your toddler cozy, calm, and entertained while they're sick. This can distract them from focusing on their own discomfort.


Try curling up with your toddler under the blankets. Spend time snuggling and reading stories.

Assess your toddler's fever.,
Give your toddler a bath.,
Encourage your toddler to drink plenty of fluids.,
Optimize skin temperature and room temperature.,
Give your toddler a fever-reducing medication.,
Ask your doctor if your child needs antibiotics.",How to Reduce Fever in a Toddler1," Take your toddler's temperature using a digital thermometer. You get the most accurate reading by taking it rectally, but you can also take it under the armpit (however this is the least accurate measure). Never mix-and-match using the same thermometer.You can also take a toddler's temperature on the forehead with a temporal artery scanner and with an in-ear thermometer.
Babies and toddlers tend to have higher body temperatures and a greater range of body temperature variation than adults. This is partly because of their bodies’ greater surface-area-to-volume ratio and partly because their immune systems are still developing.Normal body temperature for a toddler is 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit (36 - 37.2 degrees Celsius).
A low-grade fever in toddlers is in the 99 to 100.9° F (37.3 - 38.3° C) range.
A temperature of 101° F through 103.5° F (38.4 - 39.7° C) usually indicates illness that needs monitoring. Most fevers in this range are caused by viruses or a minor infection.
A temperature of over 103.6° F (39.8°C) should be treated or lowered (see next steps). If the fever goes down using the methods described in the next section, the doctor’s visit can often wait until the morning. If not, you should take your toddler to the ER immediately
Please note: this article discusses fever as a sole symptom. If there are other worrisome symptoms or if the child has a chronic condition that might be of concern, seek medical attention immediately.;
, Because water moves heat away from the body faster than air does, a bath is an effective method to reduce fever and works faster than medications. You can also use a bath to reduce fever while you are waiting for acetaminophen (Tylenol) or another pain-reliever/fever-reducer to kick in.Use lukewarm water. Never use cold water to reduce fever. Water temperature that is a little less than the body temperature provides the quickest fever reduction.
Avoid using rubbing alcohol in the bath water--that is an old recommendation and no longer encouraged by health care providers.
You can also place a cool and damp washcloth over your toddler's forehead or body to reduce fever.

, Fever can lead to dehydration, which can be a serious medical condition, and thus, it is essential you offer your child plenty of fluids to keep them hydrated.Pure water is always the best choice but other options also work if your child is picky. Offer your child fruit juices diluted with water or water flavored with fresh fruits.
You can also offer iced, non-caffeinated herbal teas (such as chamomile and peppermint) or electrolyte solutions such as Pedialyte, which can be offered to children at any age.
Be vigilant and watch for signs of dehydration. The higher the fever is the higher the risk of dehydration becomes.
Signs of dehydration include concentrated urine, which is darker yellow and perhaps strong smelling, infrequent urination (6+ hours between wettings), dry mouth and lips, absence of tears when crying, and sunken eyes.
If your toddler shows signs of dehydration, seek medical attention., Dress the child in one lightweight layer of clothing for optimal thermal control. Each layer of clothing traps more heat next to the body. Loose and thin clothes allow air to circulate more freely.Keep a thin blanket close by if your child feels cool or complains about being cold.
A mechanical or electric fan moves the air more quickly and can help in taking heat away from the skin. If you do use a fan, monitor your toddler constantly to avoid too much cooling. Don't aim the fan directly at your child.

, Medicating fever is something you should do only when needed to make the child more comfortable or to bring down a high fever that can cause serious complications.Low to mild fever is usually best left untreated unless other complications exist, whereas moderate to high fever, or fever associated with other symptoms, can and often should be treated with fever-reducing medications.
Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or paracetamol can be given to infants and toddlers. Consult your doctor on the correct dosing.
Ibuprofen (such as Advil and Motrin) can be given to children 6 months or older. Consult your doctor on the correct dosing.
Aspirin is no longer recommended for any child under the age of 18 years due to its association with Reye’s syndrome.Fever-reducing medications are available in suppository and liquid forms for children. Administer the appropriate amount, which is determined based on the age and weight of the child.
Never exceed the recommended dose or dosing interval. Keep a record of times and amounts of medications you give to your child.
If your child is taking prescription medications, please check with his or her doctor before using any over-the-counter fever reducers for toddlers.
If your toddler is vomiting and unable to keep down the medicines, you might consider using acetaminophen suppositories. Check the label for proper dosing.
If the fever-reducing medication does not lower fever temporarily, seek medical attention.

, Antibiotics are used for bacterial infections and cannot be used to treat viral infections.High and unnecessary use of antibiotics has provoked bacteria into evolving resistance. Due to this, the current recommendation is to use antibiotics as conservatively as possible.If your child does take antibiotics, make sure they finish the entire prescription.

Understand what causes fever.,
Know when to call your doctor.,
Recognize the signs of other serious symptoms.",How to Reduce Fever in a Toddler2," To a certain degree, fever is our friend. It is our body's natural response to a wide range of causes, including the following:Bacterial infections, such as streptococcal bacteria that cause strep throat or ear infection, can cause fever and are often treated with antibiotic therapy.
Viral infections such as cold, flu, and other typical childhood illnesses (chickenpox and measles). Viral infections cannot be treated with antibiotics and often the only means of treatment are waiting it out and treating the symptoms. Viral infections are the most common cause of a fever in a toddler, and fevers can often last 3-4 days.
Teething often produces low-grade fever.
Immunizations are developed to generate a mild immune response and thus can often result in low-grade fever.
A fever can occur if your child is overheated due to being in a hot environment and has heat exhaustion or heat stroke. This is a medical emergency.
Rarely, fever can be caused by an inflammatory condition such as arthritis or by other serious medical conditions, including some cancers.

, Monitoring your toddler’s fever is a bit of a balancing act—you don't want to overreact but you don't want to underestimate the situation either. Generally the younger the child is the more serious the matter is. There are some general guidelines based on your child’s age:0-3 months: fever of 100.4 F (38 C) is the point at which you should call the doctor right away, even if no other symptoms are present.Any baby under 2 months will need to be seen right away.
3 months to 2 years: fever below 102 F (38.9 C) can normally be dealt at home (see previous section).
3 months to 2 years: fever above 102 F (38.9 C) may need medical treatment. Call your child’s pediatrician for further directions. This is especially important if there are other symptoms, if the fever does not responded to medication, or if it continues for more than a day or two.

, Parents often have some intuition about the seriousness of a child's medical situation. Also children develop patterns in their responses to illnesses, and parents are often quick to notice anomalies.Fever accompanied by lethargy and/or listlessness may be signs of something more serious.
If your toddler has serious symptoms such as disorientation, bluish color around the mouth or fingertips, seizure, severe headache, stiff neck, difficulty walking, or difficulty breathing, call 911 immediately!"

Use a nasal aspirator to remove excess mucus from the toddler's nasal passages.,
Flush your child’s nasal passages with saline solution.,
Use steam to help relieve a stuffy nose.",How to Relieve Stuffy Nose in Toddlers1," Since most toddlers are not able to blow their noses, they require additional assistance in order to clear their stuffy noses. A nasal aspirator, also known as a bulb syringe, uses suction to pull mucus from the nostrils. Nasal aspirators have a bulb section and a long, narrow section you insert into the nostrils.Have the child lay down on your lap. You should be able to easily reach the toddler's nostrils and be able to hold the child in place if needed.
Pick up the nasal aspirator and squeeze the bulb portion.
Insert the tip into 1 nostril while still squeezing the bulb.
Release the pressure on the bulb gradually, allowing it to suck out the excess mucus.
Remove the nasal aspirator from the toddler's nostril and squeeze the bulb over a facial tissue to remove the mucus.
Repeat the process with the other nostril. Be sure to wash with soapy water and rinse after each use.
You can also try a NoseFrida, which is a suction device that parents use a flexible straw-like device and their own suction to draw out the mucus from the baby's nose.;
, Although most cough and cold medications are not approved for use in small children, saline solution is safe to use on babies and toddlers and can help clear a stuffy nose. If you make your own saline solution, be sure to use filtered or purified water, not tap water. Mix 1/4 tsp salt into one cup of warm water. Also keep in mind that you can buy pre-made saline solutions in drop or spray forms at the drugstore, or buy kits with the equipment you need — just add the water at home.Get the toddler in a position where the head is lower than the feet and you can easily reach the child's head.
Take your saline solution and gently squeeze two to three drops of the saline solution into each nostril.
Wait for one to two minutes to allow the solution to drain through the nasal passages. The toddler may sneeze or cough out mucus, so have facial tissues available.
Suction the toddler's nostrils with a nasal aspirator if the child doesn't sneeze or cough out the mucus.

, Warm steam can break up congestion by loosening nasal secretions. With your toddler, go into the bathroom and shut the door. Turn on the shower in a bathroom, using the hot water to generate steam. Remain in the bathroom 10 to 20 minutes."

Evaluate the toddler's diet.,
Keep the toddler's vaccinations up to date.,
Ensure the toddler gets adequate sleep.,
Schedule time for exercise.,
Reduce exposure to secondhand smoke.",How to Strengthen Toddlers Immunity," A healthy diet that includes sources of vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, omega 3 fatty acids and probiotics can help strengthen toddlers' immunity.


Limit sugar intake. Sugar and other sweeteners can actually suppress the immune system and may also lead to hyperactivity, compromising the toddler's sleep and nap schedule.
Make sure to feed the toddler at least 5 2-tbsp. (29.7 ml) size servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Include fruits such as strawberries, cantaloupe, blueberries, grapefruit, oranges, guava, papaya and mango. Boost immunity with good vegetable choices including sweet potatoes, broccoli, carrots, squash, kale and spinach. These fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins and antioxidants and help increase white blood cell count and boost antibodies, as well as natural killer cells. Natural killer cells attack microbes and cancer producing cells.
Add fish or fish oil to the toddler's diet. Fish is a source of omega 3 fatty acids, which increase macrophage activity. Macrophages are white cells that eat bacteria in the body. Serve cold water fish varieties such as salmon, as these provide the greatest amount of omega 3. You can feed a toddler up to 3 3-oz. (85 g) servings per week, or you can mix the oil from 1 fish oil capsule into the toddler's food per day.
Serve foods containing probiotics. Probiotics are healthy bacteria found in the gut. Toddlers who eat probiotic foods like yogurt may have increased immunity to rotavirus and urinary tract infections.;
, Attend well child pediatrician appointments for the toddler. Your pediatrician will have a schedule for administering each recommended vaccine at the appropriate age and frequency. Vaccines provide immunity to many serious childhood illnesses.


Make sure your toddler gets a yearly flu shot in addition to the standard vaccines.

, Toddlers need 12 to 13 hours of sleep per day. Sleep is necessary for a healthy immune system. Sleep deprivation can decrease the number of natural killer cells in the body and make a person more susceptible to illness.


Schedule morning or afternoon naps into the toddler's daily routine.
Discuss sleeping problems with your pediatrician if your toddler has trouble sleeping. Your pediatrician should be able to provide suggestions for resolving sleep issues.

, Exercise can help increase a person's number of natural killer cells and is an important part of overall good health.


Organize family exercise time in addition to solitary play. Good activities include hiking, a biking outing with the toddler on a tricycle, and any outdoor games such as kick ball or wiffle ball.

, Children who are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke are at greater risk for bronchitis, ear infections, asthma and other respiratory conditions. Small children breathe at a faster rate and inhale more of the toxins than an adult, so even limited exposure to secondhand smoke can be more harmful than for adults.


Encourage all caregivers to quit smoking or cease smoking around the toddler.
Request that any visitors or family members who will not quit smoking only smoke outside, well away from the toddler.

Start by helping your child pull down their pants, underwear or training pants/diaper, and get on the toilet.,
Read 1-4 potty books.,
Try practicing with a doll.,
Help your child go.,
Fill a cup with water, milk, juice, or lemonade.,
Sing some songs and say some rhymes.,
Watch some potty videos on your phone or iPad from YouTube, or watch a potty movie or television show to help them think about going potty.,
Relax.,
Talk with your child.,
Let your child color a potty coloring page on a clipboard.,
Sometimes, your child may want to make her doll go in her diaper or training pants.,
When your child does go, conduct wiping and flushing.,
Reward them for going potty.",How to Conduct Potty Time," Make sure that they are safe and comfortable. Also, make sure that you have all of the ""Things You'll Need"" nearby. Make sure that they are within reach of your child and you.;
, Start by reading one, then ask your child if they want to read another one. If your child can't talk, decide by seeing if they refuse another book or just seem distracted or bored. Keep on reading until your child is ready to be done or if you are ready to be done.

, If they have one, let your child feed their ""drink and wet"" doll. Make sure that they hold it over the toilet, a potty chair, or a doll toilet so that the doll does not go on the floor! Hold the cup up to the mouth and tip or squeeze it so that the water goes down the doll. Then, watch the doll go.

, Turn on the faucet in a nearby sink so that your child can see the water running. Let your child watch for up to 30 seconds. Then, turn it off. The water helps the child let it flow and to go to the bathroom in the potty.

, Encourage your child to drink as many cups as they would like. This may help them go as well. Don't force a child to drink, though. This only makes potty time more dreadful and makes them create a bad impression towards drinking and going potty in the toilet.

, Sing along to your potty CD or say the rhymes yourself with your child. Try looking at your local library for a CD or rhymes. The internet has plenty of options, too!

, You can also let them play on a potty app.

, Help your child sit back and think about going and flowing. Push on the tummy or bladder to help, too. Encourage your child to push on their body, not you. If it gets painful, make them stop immediately.

, Talk about what a big kid they are for sitting on the toilet and possibly going. Tell them how much fun it is and how they can go on the potty just like you! Praise and encourage them. Point out all of the things in the bathroom: the toilet, potty chair (if there is one), toilet paper, sink, soap, towels, light, door, trash can, flusher, toilet seat, wipes, and training pants or underwear.


Teaching children these words also helps with communication during potty learning, school readiness, and being able to shop and talk with others.

, Use a clipboard or tray whenever possible to prevent loosing your coloring page and crayons or colored pencils! Talk about the picture with your child, pointing out all of the items in it. You can also color on a potty app, see step seven.

, Let your child change the doll and clean up the ""accident"" the doll had. Explain to your child that accidents are okay and that dolly should try to go in the potty after having an accident. Practice and talk about this with your child.

, Let your child try wiping and then have you ""check"" heir wiping. Also, let them flush if are not scared. Sing along during hand washing (make sure hand washing takes at least 30 seconds). Make sure dolly washes his/her hands to! Wipe up any messes and turn off the lights. Let your child help you with everything.

, Put a sticker on a sticker chart. Have a tiny treat. You can even let them choose what to eat (as long as it a reasonable choice and healthy) or let them choose what to do next. A fun potty app may have games to play as a reward.


Rewarding children will build up their self-esteem and make them want to have more potty time.

Remove irritants from the toddler's environment.,
Change your furnace or air conditioner air filter frequently.,
Consult your local weather report for the daily pollen count.,
Wash your child’s hands frequently.",How to Relieve Stuffy Nose in Toddlers2," Common irritants include cigarette smoke, pollen, and pet dander. Ask all people living in the toddler's home to quit smoking or to refrain from smoking indoors or around the exterior of the dwelling. If they are smoking outside of the home, they should change their clothes as soon as they return home., Most air filter manufacturers recommend you use a new filter every 30 to 60 days, but you may want to change the filter more frequently if you have pets or you or your family members suffer from allergies. To determine whether you should replace your filter, physically inspect the filter to see if it is dirty — animal hair and dander can quickly clog an air filter.

, Toddlers who are allergic or sensitive to pollen should stay indoors on days the pollen count is high. Try to schedule outdoor activities on days with a low pollen count.

, This will help prevent him from getting more germs and conceivably getting sicker. It’s also going to help you get rid of the germs that have collected on his hands. "
"
Make sure the toddler stays hydrated.,
Offer foods that can help.,
Give your child some chicken soup.",How to Relieve Stuffy Nose in Toddlers3," Adequate fluid intake helps keep the mucus thinner and easier to swallow, reducing congestion. Water and an electrolytes drink, like Pedialyte, are the best choices. The child should get about four cups of water a day total (this includes water in food as well)., Fruits and vegetables high in vitamins like apples, citrus, and leafy greens are great for keeping his or her immune system strong. Even if your child doesn’t have much of an appetite, a whole-grain hot cereal would also help. In addition to being high in fiber, the steam and heat from the cereal can help clear a mucus-filled nose., Traditional wisdom was right — chicken soup and other broth-based soups can help your child recover from a cold. It boosts your immune system, and based on the ingredients, can add electrolytes and an array of vitamins, as well as helping to thin out mucus. "
"
Make sure your child gets plenty of sleep.,
Elevate the toddler's head during sleep.,
Place a cool mist vaporizer or ultrasonic humidifier in the toddler's room at night.",How to Relieve Stuffy Nose in Toddlers4," While your child is unwell, she will probably sleep more than usual, which is one way a child’s body is helping it to get well. Make it possible for your child to rest more than normal, both at night and during the day., Raising the head higher than the rest of the body can make it easier for the child to breathe while sleeping with a stuffy nose. Raise the child's mattress by placing a crib wedge or towel underneath the head end of the mattress.

, A humidifier helps moisten the air, making it easier for a child with a stuffy nose to breathe and sleep soundly. Clean the cool mist vaporizer or humidifier frequently because mold and bacteria can build up in the machine. Rinse daily with hot water and use a diluted bleach solution to clean the humidifier after every three days of use. Rinse thoroughly with water after cleaning with the bleach solution."

Brush your child's teeth twice a day.,
Put a small amount of toothpaste on the brush.,
Have the child lay their head on your lap.,
Teach your child to spit.,
Limit snacks that are high in carbohydrates.,
Skip sugary beverages.,
Discourage all-day snacking.,
Take the bottle away at bedtime.,
Have your child switch to a regular cup.,
Skip sugaring the pacifier.,
Have your child drink water with fluoride.,
Don't share utensils or toothbrushes.,
Take your toddler to the dentist frequently.",How to Prevent Toddler Tooth Decay," Just like you, your toddler needs to brush twice a day; however, your toddler can't be trusted to brush their teeth alone, even if they're going through an independent streak.Most kids won't brush thoroughly. Rather, they'll stick to the front part of the mouth, ignoring the rest of the teeth, which is why you need to take over.If your child insists on brushing their own teeth, you can let them, then take a pass at it yourself to make sure you get all their teeth brushed.;
, You can only use a small amount of toothpaste because kids have a tendency to swallow it, especially if it produces a lot of foam. Children two and under should have their teeth brushed only with a soft brush and water. Children between two and six should brush with a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste made specifically for kids. Make sure you're also using a toddler-sized toothbrush so it fits your child's mouth.Check to see that your toothpaste has fluoride in it, as that helps protect against cavities and tooth decay.If, for some reason, you don't have access to children's toothpaste, then use a dab of regular toothpaste only about the size of half of a pea.
Your toddler's toothbrush should be replaced every three months., To make it easier, brush your toddler's teeth on your lap. You can reach the whole mouth better, making it likelier that all of your child's teeth will get brushed. Hold the brush at a 45-degree angle to the gum line, and brush all of your toddler's teeth equally, making sure you get the parts of teeth facing inward as well as the parts facing outward.Move the brush in tiny circles across the teeth, rather than back and forth, as that is better on your child's gums.As your child gets used to having you brush their teeth, try doing it with them in front of a mirror so that they can see proper technique. Hold your child's hand in yours and guide their brushing so they can also feel what the motions of proper brushing technique feel like.
Make sure you get all the food out of your child's teeth as you brush.
Singing a little song or telling a story while you brush can help pass the time more quickly.

, When your child turns two (approximately), they should be able to start learning to spit after brushing. Instruct them to spit in the sink. You can even show them how to do the behavior. Don't let them rinse first, as that will increase the likelihood that they will swallow the toothpaste.You can have your child rinse after they spit.

, Foods like crackers and cereals are high in carbohydrates. They turn into sugars, which can harm your child's teeth. Toddlers have a less mineralized enamel than adults, and the risk of cavities is higher. This is especially true if they eat a lot of sugary foods and don't have good oral hygiene. Try limiting how often you give your child these snacks to help cut down on tooth decay.Also, try to avoid sugary snacks like candy or ice cream. Keep those as a special treat.


Instead, pick snacks like cheese or avocado slices.When you do give your child sugary foods, try giving them to your child during a meal. That way, the sugar is mixed with other foods, causing less harm to your child's teeth.
If your child does eat sugary snacks, ask them to wash their mouths afterwards to help get rid of the sugar. Brushing is even better., You may avoid giving your child candy because you know it can cause problems with their teeth. You may not know that juice can be just as bad, particularly if your child drinks it often. Water is a much better choice, as it keeps your child hydrated without soaking their teeth in sugar.Baby bottle tooth decay is a particular case which may also affect toddlers' front teeth if they used to drink a lot of milk or sweetened liquids.
One way you can slow down sugar intake is to dilute juice with water.

, Having a regular snack and meal schedule gives your child times when food is not working on their teeth. If your child snacks all day long, this causes their mouths to constantly be in an acidic state, which can damage enamel and lead to tooth decay. Try to space out eating, leaving as long as 90 minutes to two hours between eating., Letting your child have a bottle at night means that milk will sit on your child's teeth.As it sits on your child's teeth, it turns to sugar. Over time, that can lead to tooth decay, even in young children and babies. Therefore, it's best to avoid putting your child to bed with a bottle.In addition, giving your child a bottle at night can lead to choking issues.
Never put sugary drinks in bottles, even during the day. That allows the drink to sit on your child's teeth., Switching to a regular cup prevents your child from walking around with a bottle in their mouth. Constantly having it in their mouth leads to sugar staying on their teeth if they're drinking a sugary drink. By about one year of age, your child should be using a normal cup if possible., Some parents like to add honey or sugar to their child's pacifier to make it more attractive for the child; however, doing so leaves sugar on your child's teeth, which can lead to tooth decay. It's best to skip this practice altogether and just give your child a regular pacifier., While some activists have questioned the importance of fluoride in water, fluoride is an important component in keeping your child's teeth healthy, and just brushing with it won't do it. Your child also needs to get it from other sources, such as from drinking tap water.In the past, most cities put fluoride in the tap water, but some have stopped adding it, so check with your public water system to find out. In addition, you will want to ask about the percentage of fluoride to make sure it is not too high — check with your dentist to learn what is an appropriate amount for your child.
If your child doesn't get it from tap water, your dentist should have fluoride supplements that can be taken instead.
Fluoride is beneficial only in certain quantities — it is possible for your child to get too much fluoride, which can cause dental fluorosis, harming developing permanent teeth.

, Everyone has different germs in their mouths that cause tooth decay, and you can pass those germs to your kids; therefore, it's important that you don't share items with your kids that go in your mouth, such as spoons, toothbrushes, and forks., Just like adults, children should go to the dentist often, usually twice a year, though some kids may need to go every three months.Find a kid-friendly dentist who will work with your child even if they have fears about going to the dentist. Consider asking other parents with kids who they use.Your child's first dental visit should be at about six months, or when your child gets their first tooth, so you may be able to wait up to a year in some cases.One way to help calm a child's fears about the dentist is to let the child know you will stay in the exam room with them the whole time. Hold their hand to feel safe during the consultation and make their experience easier. If the dentist will not allow you to be in the room with your child, then choose a different dentist.
If your child is afraid, talk to them about what exactly they're afraid of. Once you know what's causing their fears, you can help find a way for them to deal with them.
Ask about sealants. Your child's dentist can put sealants on their teeth to help protect them from bacteria. Ask your dentist if they provide this service.

The amount of sleep your child needs will vary according to age and individual needs. In general healthy children need:11 – 18 hours as newborns
9 – 12 hours from 4 to 11 months old
11 – 14 hours from 1 to 2 years old
11– 13 hours when they are 3 to 5 years old
9 – 11 hours when they are 6 to 13 years old
8 – 10 hours in their teens

, If your child’s temperature rises, she may get the chills and even start shivering. This occurs when the body temperature rises in relation to the air temperature. If your child gets the chills, take her temperature to see if she is running a fever and keep her warm.


A normal body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most pediatricians define a fever as a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher.
Tuck her into bed and put extra blankets on the bed. If your child is an infant, wrap her in a blanket and hold her. Your body heat will help keep her warm.
If her fever starts coming down she may suddenly feel very warm and remove the blankets. Let her regulate her temperature as needed. Remove extra blankets if your infant starts to feel very warm.

, Use a cool-mist humidifier to keep the air moist in his room when he sleeps at night. This will make it easier for him to breathe, soothe coughing, and help him fall asleep quickly.A cool-mist humidifier is safer than a hot-water vaporizer for children. This way if he bumps into it in the night, there is no risk that he will get burned.
If you don’t have a humidifier, you can make one by putting a pot of water on the radiator in the child’s room. If the radiator is on, the water will steadily evaporate and moisten the air.

, Chicken soup is excellent for helping the body fight an infection. The fluid will prevent dehydration and the salt and nutrients will replenish electrolytes that may have been lost during sweating.As your child starts to feel better you can add some vegetables, noodles, or chunks of chicken to the broth to make it heartier.

A lack of water in the system will cause dry stools. Give your child more water per day, which will make her stool softer. The softer her stool, the easier it will be to have a bowel movement.


You can also give her diluted juice, which will have the same effect. Use prune juice, apple juice, or pear juice. Use only 100% juice. Juice with added sugars are not healthy for your child.
Dilute it by adding one ounce of water for every ounce of juice. Try to give her at least 32 ounces of water every day. If you use diluted juice, make sure 3/4 of her daily liquid intake is water., If your child is suffering from constipation, you may need to help get things moving. To help, gently massage your toddler’s abdomen to stimulate bowel movements.


Start at the lower right part of the belly, applying pressure to the abdomen in a gentle, circular motion. Massage it up and then across the belly. Next, move to the lower left part of the abdomen.
You may feel a mass in the lower left part of the abdomen. Don't worry because that is normal. What you feel is the stool.
Never press hard. You may cause injury., If you child is potty training, too much stress may be causing him to avoid going to the bathroom. The experience should be a calm and low-pressure experience for you and your child. Pressuring your child to have a bowel movement is not helpful and can cause your child to resist the action.


Give your child a reward for using the toilet. Read to him or tell him a funny story so he is relaxed. Even if his use of the toilet is unsuccessful, reward the effort.
Don’t force your child to do anything he isn't ready for. He may start thinking the toilet is a punishment and that he should avoid it., A good way to help your child get over constipation is to keep her active.

Ensure the child’s mother eats a diet high in iron during pregnancy.,
Breastfeed your baby for at least 6 months, if possible.,
Introduce solid food at age 6 months.,
Ensure your child has a well-rounded diet after age 1.,
Limit how much cow's milk children under 2 years of age drink.,
Make sure your child gets enough vitamin C. Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron.Include foods rich in vitamin C in your child’s diet, such as:Citrus (oranges, grapefruit, etc.)",How to Prevent Iron Deficiency Anemia in Infants and Toddlers1," In the womb, babies get their iron supply from their mother. That means that newborns will have iron stores for their first 6 months of life if they get enough before they’re born.Pregnant mothers should eat red meat and other iron-rich foods throughout pregnancy like poultry, lentils, beans, green leafy vegetables nuts, dried fruit, eggs, and enriched grains.If you're pregnant, focus on getting enough iron by discussing your diet with your doctor - you can take supplements if they suggest it. If you will be caring for another person's child, consider having a conversation about prenatal diet with the baby's biological mother.
Iron deficiency during pregnancy increases the chances that the baby will be born early or underweight. These are both risk factors for iron deficiency anemia for infants.;
, Breast milk is a good source of iron, and will keep your child’s iron stores up through their first six months of life. If you do not want to or cannot breastfeed, be sure to feed your baby a formula that is rich in iron for the first year while you introduce solid foods.Infants up to the age of 6 months require 0.27 mg of iron daily. Iron requirement increases to 11 mg per day for infants age 7-12 months. The recommended daily allowance of iron for toddlers age 1-3 is 7 mg per day., At 6 months old, your baby starts to need more iron from their food.At this time, start to incorporate iron-fortified cereal mixed with formula or breast milk into your baby’s daily diet. When they acclimate to the cereal, you can begin to feed them pureed fruits, vegetables, and meats. Waiting too long to add solid food to their diet increases their risk of iron deficiency. However, introducing solid food too soon is not recommended either. It’s best to start at introducing solid food at 6 months.

, Poor diet and malnutrition, especially after age 1-2, when your child is having huge growth spurts, can cause anemia from low iron. Children who eat little or no meat are the most at risk. Add lean red meat to their meals 3-4 times a week, if possible.Other iron-rich foods you can give your child are lentils, beans, chickpeas, green leafy vegetables, dried fruit, nuts, fish like salmon and tuna, eggs, poultry, and enriched or fortified whole-grains.If you or your family are vegetarian or vegan, consider feeding your child additional foods with high iron content, especially beans and lentils. Seek advice from a dietitian to create a diet that is healthy for your child’s development.You may also need help from a dietitian if your child is a “picky eater,” limiting variety in their diet.
Don't give children younger than 5 years old whole nuts to eat, because they could choke.

, Cow’s milk, goat’s milk, and soymilk all have low iron content, and may even make it harder for your child’s body to absorb iron.If milk replaces solid food in the first 2 years, your child may not get the iron they need in their diet.


You don’t have to avoid milk altogether, but be sure it doesn’t replace more iron-rich breast milk and foods by limiting milk to less than 24 ounces (680 grams) a day for children under 2 years old.,
Tropical fruits like mango, papaya, pineapple, cantaloupe and kiwi
Watermelon, strawberries, cranberries, raspberries and blueberries
Leafy greens like spinach, cabbage, and turnip greens
Broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower
Tomatoes, green and red pepper, potatoes, and winter squash
Foods and beverages labeled as “fortified” with vitamin C.

Talk to your doctor.,
Seat your child in a high chair or your lap.,
Place the nebulizer on a sturdy surface.,
Place the medicine in the nebulizer cup.,
Replace the top of the nebulizer cup.,
Connect the nebulizer to the tubing and compressor.,
Turn on the compressor.,
Place the mask over your child’s face.,
Have your toddler inhale slowly and deeply.",How to Nebulize a Toddler1," Before you use a nebulizer with your toddler, talk to their doctor. They'll give your specific instructions for how much medication to use and how long your child should use the nebulizer. Make sure you follow your doctor's directions very carefully. Your doctor can tell you where to get a nebulizer, or you can purchase them from most pharmacies.
, It’s important that they don’t move while the nebulizer is working. Moving the mask as little as a half inch can cause half of the medication not to make it into your toddler’s lungs. Have them sit in a high chair or your lap so that they’re comfortable but not able to move much., The nebulizer can be a bit heavy, and you don’t want to risk knocking it over and it hurting someone on the way down. Place it on a table or desk, far enough away from the edge that it can’t get knocked off., Take the top off the nebulizer cup and pour the medicine in the cup. The amount of medicine you need will vary according to what your toddler is being treated for, how old they are, and how severe their medical condition is. Make sure you follow your doctor’s instructions exactly., Then connect the cup to the nebulizer. Depending on the type of nebulizer, you might have a mouthpiece or mask. The nebulizer will connect differently to the cup depending on the type you have., The tubing will connect the face mask or mouthpiece to the compressor, which makes the steam that delivers the medicine to your toddler’s lungs. Make sure the tubing is inserted as far as it will go – if not, you risk some of the medicine leaking out., If everything is connected correctly, you should see a light mist coming out of the compressor. If you don’t see a mist, the tubing may not be securely connected. Turn the compressor off and recheck your connections., If you’re using a mouthpiece, place it in your toddler’s mouth and have them close their lips around it. Make sure the mask or mouthpiece is positioned comfortably so your toddler is less likely to fidget., It might help to breathe along with them so they know how deep to breathe. Ask them to hold their breath for about 5 seconds and then exhale. Repeat this breathing pattern for 5 to 10 minutes or until the medicine is completely gone."

Reduce pain and fever with medications.,
Consult your child’s doctor before giving a cough syrup.,
Ask your doctor about antiviral medications.,
Relieve a stuffy nose with saline drops.,
Bring your child to the doctor if she is very ill. Children’s immune systems are not as developed as those of adults, which means they are vulnerable to complications.",How to Treat Flu in Toddlers2," Over-the-counter medications are effective at lowering a fever and providing relief for headaches, sore throat, and joint pain. Children and teenagers should never be given medications containing aspirin because it may cause Reye’s syndrome.Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) are safe alternatives to aspirin. Consult your child’s doctor to make sure the medication will be appropriate for him.
If you are unsure how to treat your child, contact your doctor. Always read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Do not give children more than the recommended dosages. Many over-the-counter medications should not be given to young children.
Over-the-counter medications may interact with other medications, including prescription drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements.

, Cough syrups may suppress coughing but they don’t actually kill the infection. Because coughing removes foreign material from the lungs, suppressing the coughing can slow the healing process. The advantage is that suppressing the coughing may help your child sleep at night. If your child can’t sleep because of coughing, ask the doctor for advice.Cough syrups should not be given to children younger than four. For older children, following the manufacturer’s dosing instructions.
Be aware that some cough syrups have the same active ingredients as some other over-the-counter medications. Check the ingredients on the packaging to make sure you don’t give your child more than one medication with the same active ingredients. This can lead to an accidental overdose.

, If your child has the flu caused by the influenza virus, antiviral medications may be recommended in certain situations, such as children with asthma or other medical problems, and children under age two. Antiviral medications may reduce the severity and duration of symptoms, and also reduce the chance your child will pass the flu to others.


Influenza antiviral medications are most effective if they are started within two days after your child becomes sick. Treatment usually lasts for five days.Antivirals are only available through prescription and may come in liquid, pill, or inhaler form.Your doctor may prescribe Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) or Zanamivir (Relenza®, Diskhaler®)., You can use a dropper to gently squeeze a few drops into each nostril. The salt will help thin out the mucus and make breathing easier. If the only ingredients are salt and water, then it is safe for children. Check the ingredients on the packaging to make sure there are no preservatives added.Some preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride may damage the nasal tissues.
You can also make your own nasal spray by adding salt to water that has been boiled, then cooled to a warm temperature.
Do not give nasal decongestant sprays or drops to children. They can cause inflammation in the nasal tissues and aggravate your child’s symptoms.

, Your child should be seen by a doctor if she has:A fever for over 24 hours and is younger than two
A fever for over three days and is over two
A fever of 100°F (37.8°C) or higher and is three months old or younger.
A fever of 104°F (40°C)
Periods of crying for a long time. This is particularly important for children who are too young to tell you what hurts.

Get your child a flu shot if she is over six months old.,
Teach your child to wash his hands.,
Have your child use a hand sanitizer when soap and water are unavailable.,
Instruct your child to cover when coughing or sneezing.,
Keep your child home when she exhibits signs of illness.",How to Treat Flu in Toddlers3," Vaccinating your child against the flu each year is the absolute best way to protect your child.The vaccine generally protects against three to four common strains of flu virus. Because the virus is ever-changing, your child must get a flu shot every season — a flu shot last season won't protect her this season.


You and the other members of your family should also get flu shots.
Children between six months and eight years old may need two doses within 28 days of each other if it is the first time they have received the flu shot.Ask your doctor to find out if your child needs two doses.

, This will help him to reduce the number of times he is sick with the flu and teach him avoid passing it to others when he does get sick. Teach him to wash his hands before eating, after going to the bathroom, and after blowing his nose, coughing, or sneezing. Direct him to use these steps when washing his hands:Run his hands under the water.
Lather his hands with soap and rub them together for at least 20 seconds. Remind him to clean between his fingers and under his fingernails.
Rinse the soap and dirt off under running water.

, Hand sanitizers should be at least 60% alcohol to be effective. They can be used if you are in an area where soap and clean water are unavailable or when traveling.Put a dollop in the palm of her hand. Teach her to rub her hands together until the sanitizer is spread all over her hands. She should keep rubbing until it dries.
Teach her to avoid touching her nose, eyes or mouth if her hands are not clean. The nose, eyes, and mouth are entry points for flu viruses to enter the body.

, This is important for your child to learn so that he doesn’t spread the flu when he has it. He should:Sneeze or cough into a tissue and then throw the tissue in the garbage.
Sneeze or cough into his elbow, and not on his hands. This will reduce the likelihood that he will spread the flu to others via his hands.
Wash his hands if he sneezes or coughs on them.

, If your child has a fever or signs of the flu, keep her out of daycare or school to prevent spreading the virus to other children. Your child may be contagious from one day before getting sick to up to five or seven days after, or even longer if she still exhibits symptoms.Keeping your child home when she is sick can help keep the virus from spreading.


You should also avoid sharing cups and eating utensils when children are ill to prevent spreading the flu.

Recognize signs and symptoms of iron deficiency anemia.,
Test high-risk children between 6 and 12 months of age.,
Ask your doctor about iron supplements.",How to Prevent Iron Deficiency Anemia in Infants and Toddlers2," If low iron is making your child anemic, they may lose their appetite, get frequent infections, be lethargic or weak, get out of breath easily, sweat more, look pale, act out behaviorally, grow more slowly than expected, or in severe cases have cravings to eat dirt or chalk (a disorder called pica).If your child shows anemia symptoms, contact your doctor about a possible blood test to check their iron levels.

, Children between the ages of 6 and 12 months who have an increased risk of iron deficiency should be screened for their iron level.A child may be high-risk if they are breastfed past 6 months without the addition of any solid foods, or if they will not eat iron-rich foods. Certain medical conditions or medications can also put a child at risk for iron deficiency. Children from low income families or those receiving government assistance are also considered high-risk for iron deficiency.


Premature and underweight babies may be screened for iron levels earlier than 6 months.High risk children should also be checked again around age 15 and 30 months., Children who do not get sufficient iron from their formula, breast milk, or solid food as infants and toddlers may need iron drops to supplement their nutritional intake. This may include infants who cannot tolerate iron-enriched formula or those that will not eat iron-fortified food during the second half of the first year and later.


If you are concerned about your child's nutritional needs, speak with their pediatrician to find out if supplementation is necessary for your child's healthy development.

By making the mask seem like the most special or exciting part of the nebulizer, you can help your toddler feel less scared. You can try telling them it’s a pilot mask or a mask for a spaceship., As long as you stick to decorating the outside of the mask, it will still work properly. Let your toddler decorate it with stickers so they feel it’s theirs.You can also buy masks in the shape of animal’s faces. If your toddler has a health condition – like asthma – that might require the regular use of the nebulizer, investing in an animal-shaped mask might make things easier on your toddler.

, They can watch you put the medicine in, fill the nebulizer with water, or prepare the tubing. It will make the nebulizer seem much less mysterious and therefore less scary., Most toddlers can’t sit still for more than a few seconds, and it can be especially hard when they’re wearing a mask over their face. Read a story to them, or watch a short video or cartoon while they’re being nebulized."

Continue offering new foods.,
Offer small portions.,
Focus on making healthy meals and snacks.,
Include familiar food with each meal.",How to Improve Your Toddler's Eating Habits1," Your child will probably not like a food the first time they eat it. Your child may be resistant to new, unfamiliar foods. Sometimes, toddlers get into a pattern in which they want the same thing every day for every meal. This doesn’t mean you give up teaching your child to eat new foods. Keep giving your child new foods and eventually your child will become accustomed to the new foods.Research states that it may take a child 10 to 20 times of trying a new food before they accept it and start eating it.;
, Toddlers don’t eat as much as adults. Especially if you have a picky eater, you don’t want to put too much food on the plate. Presenting your toddler with portions that are too big can overwhelm them.Set out small amounts of each food. Try starting with a tablespoon for each food you serve.
If your child likes the food, add more food.

, You control what your toddler eats. This means you can teach your child healthy eating habits from the start. Focus on well-balanced, nutritious meals and eliminate unhealthy foods and junk.Fix meals with lean meats, vegetables, whole-grains, fruits, and low-fat dairy.
Reduce the amount of foods you serve with high levels of fat, sugar, cholesterol, and sodium.

, To help ease your toddler into eating new foods, serve something familiar that they like with each meal. This helps give your toddler something to eat combined with new foods to try.If your child loves pasta, make pasta along with a green vegetable and chicken. If you kid loves macaroni and cheese, make that with fish and carrots.

Of course a child is going to like the taste of desserts or certain snacks. Your child can also learn to like the taste of healthy foods, like vegetables. At dinner, tell your child to taste each food you serve. It may take a few tries before your toddler becomes used to the taste of these new foods.Explain to your toddler that tasting food is part of the process. Tell your child that tasting helps the tongue learn new flavors.
Often, tasting a food over and over will help your toddler get used to the taste of a new food.

, For a toddler, eating new food is a learning experience. New, solid food is something your child hasn’t had exposure to yet. Let your child play with the food. This encourages your child discover the food.


This may include picking it up and feeling it. Your child may also sniff it, lick it, or nibble on it.
This can also be a fun for everyone to be more mindful of the food they are about to eat. You can encourage the whole family to describe the new food — look, color, texture, smell, touch, flavor, etc.

, When toddlers start eating solid food, they gain a new independence. Let them explore this independence. When you are at the grocery store, let your child help you choose the vegetables or meat. At home, make your toddler part of the meal preparation and menu planning.Present your child with choices for dinner and get them to choose. For example, ask your child if they would like to eat broccoli, kale, or carrots.
Try presenting your child with foods in different colors and textures. This might help them choose something they prefer.

, For each meal, provide different foods for your child to choose from. This helps your child feel independent while getting nutritious food. Mix it up with each meal. If your child doesn’t choose a particular food one day, try it again with different foods.For example, you can offer two vegetable choices, a whole grain, a fruit, and a meat for your child. Let your child choose which of these foods to eat.

Introduce one new food at a time.,
Make the same food different ways.,
Try smoothies.,
Add healthy dips and sauces.",How to Improve Your Toddler's Eating Habits3," Since solid food is a new experience for your toddler, you should introduce it slowly. Trying to make your child eat too many new, unfamiliar, and daunting foods may result in resistance to eating. When you make foods for your family, introduce one food at a time. Serve it with something you know your child likes.


If your child doesn’t like the new food, be calm. Don’t react negatively, and don’t force your child to eat the new food. Let the child taste it, and try again later.

, Sometimes, a person may not like a food one way but enjoy it prepared a different way. This might be true for your toddler. Before giving up on a food, try preparing and serving it different ways. If you run out of ways to make a food, search the internet for new ideas.For example, if your child doesn’t like cauliflower, try making mashed cauliflower with a little cheese and bacon crumbles. Make sweet potato fries instead of serving a baked sweet potato. Make kale chips. Cook some broccoli tots, or use spaghetti squash in place of pasta or mixed in with a pasta dish.
Offer your child different foods from the same food group. Just because your child doesn’t like one food may not mean they won’t like another similar food.Many food blogs and cookbooks are geared towards parents. These resources can provide you with healthy and kid-friendly recipes.

, Smoothies are not just an after workout snack. They can be great for helping improve the eating habits of toddlers. You can add vegetables and fruits to the smoothies to get your child nutritious and tasty food.Make sure if you make smoothies for your child that you don’t fill it full of unhealthy junk food, like ice cream, sherbet, or sugar-filled yogurt.
Make smoothies with vegetables, like pumpkin, leafy greens, broccoli, peas, or beets. Add fruit for some natural sweetness. Berries and bananas are great in smoothies.
You can also include avocados for healthy fats.
Use low-fat milk, or almond or coconut milk. You can also try plain yogurt or kefir.

, Sometimes, a plain vegetable may not be appealing. Maybe your child likes to touch and play with the food before eating it. Dips and sauces can be helpful in getting your kids to eat vegetables or fruits. Kids love dipping veggies and fruit in sauces, and it adds some additional flavor your child might like.Make sure to offer healthy dipping sauces. Don’t provide dipping sauces with lots of cheese, heavy cream, and fat. Also avoid dipping sauces with too much sugar. You want to supplement the nutrition of the food, not cover it up with fat, sugar, and junk.
Try traditional or vegetable hummus, natural applesauce, mustard, or plain yogurt lightly sweetened with honey.

Serve the same food to everyone.,
Model good eating habits.,
Establish a meal schedule.",How to Improve Your Toddler's Eating Habits4," A good way to promote healthy eating habits is to serve everyone at the table the same foods. Fix a meal for the entire family and expect everyone to eat it. Make healthy, balanced meals that everyone enjoys, including your toddler. During this time, refrain from making too many new dishes or dishes that may not appeal to your toddler, like things with too many spices.If your child isn’t interested in one of the foods, or doesn’t eat much, stay calm and don’t overreact. Don’t force your child to eat the food.
Make sure you don’t make the child something else to eat in place of the food on the table. That reinforces bad behavior and teaches your child that refusal results in different food.
If you have a picky eater, make sure to have a couple of options that your child likes along with new options. As long as the child is getting a balanced meal (think eating the rainbow), there is no need to fuss.
Allow time for your child to adjust to eating these new foods.

, Your child learns a lot just by watching you. If you want your child to have good eating habits, model them for your child. When your toddler sees you eating good food, like chicken and vegetables, you will set an example for them to follow.Eating good food with your children helps normalize the idea of healthy eating habits. You also may avoid the idea that kids have to eat vegetables and adults can eat anything.
Often parents don't think toddlers will like ""grown up food"" that may have more spice to it. It's best to allow your child to safely taste food, even if you don't think they will like it. Their taste is developing and the more options, the more refined and open they will be, especially if they initiate a desire to taste.

, Having a set time to eat may help improve your toddler’s eating habits. This helps your child get hungry around the same times each day. You should also include snacks into the schedule. Have a consistent snack time and don’t let your child eat outside of that if possible.Refrain from letting your child eat between the scheduled meal times.
You should also watch what your child is drinking between meals. Too much milk and juice may reduce appetites."
"
Avoid using food as a reward.,
Refrain from bargaining.,
Make mealtime a positive experience.,
Eliminate distractions during mealtimes.",How to Improve Your Toddler's Eating Habits5," Many parents may find that the easiest way to stop their toddler’s outburst is to give them a cookie. This is a bad practice. Using sweets and junk food as a treat can encourage unhealthy eating habits at a young age.Rewarding children for tantrums or whining can reinforce bad behavior, causing the child to think that whining or crying will result in a treat.Providing treats or food when the child is emotional may teach the child to eat emotionally.
You should also refrain from using dessert or sweets as a reward for eating vegetables or other foods at dinner. This sets up a pattern of sweets being the best part of the meal, which develops unhealthy eating habits., You shouldn’t bargain with your toddler about eating. Don’t tell your child that they can have another food or get to do an activity if they eat a few bites of food. This sets up a negative food pattern.Instead, give your toddler some control over their food by letting them choose foods. Make sure to present your child with two choices you decide on. For example, don’t just blanket ask your child what they want to eat. Instead, phrase the choices like, “Would you like grapes or an apple? Do you want chicken or fish?”

, Kids can develop eating anxiety and they can be discouraged or act resistant to eating if meals are a bad experience for them. You should make mealtimes a good experience for the whole family.Refrain from yelling at your child or other family members during meals. This might lead to negative responses.
Encourage you child to recognize if they are not hungry and put the food away and try later, but with the same food. They can still sit at the table for family mealtime even if they are not eating.

, When it is time for your toddler to eat, that should be the only activity. You shouldn’t eat dinner while watching television, playing games, or doing anything else that will distract your child from eating. Your child should focus on eating and the food.You should also not be distracted. This means everyone at the table should put away their phone, tablet, or computer during meal times. Make mealtimes about eating.

Use cabinet and drawer child latches to keep little hands out of poison and sharp items.,
If you can, leave some items accessible to toddlers that are safe.,
Make sure all toilet and shower cleansers are locked up, just like detergents and other chemicals in the kitchen.

,
Keep the floors dry.,
Do not allow your toddler to stand or engage in horseplay while taking a bath.,
Take safety precautions for doorways and stairways.,
Make sure any furniture that children can climb (such as bookcases or entertainment centers) are affixed to the studs in the walls.,
Put toys and other items away often.",How to Make a Home Safe for Toddlers," Keep heavy items locked away or well out of their reach. If oven doors are not lockable, buy a latch to keep them shut unless you want to watch your child at all times when baking.;
, They can bang on pans or sort your plastic storage containers while you cook or clean. If children cannot get into anything, they will find ways to get around your child-proofing measures.

,, Toddlers are not as sure of themselves when walking as older children, so it is especially important to ensure that the floors are dry and not slippery. If your bathroom floor has very slippery tile, it would be a good idea to put down rugs with a plastic gripping material on the back.

, They could easily slip and hurt themselves. If the tub is slippery, using items like textured bath stickers or mats could help keep toddlers safe. Always supervise young children closely when in the bath because they can drown in only inches of water.

, If your toddler is the curious type, an open door is an open invitation to trouble. Make sure you close and lock any doors to the outside or to unsafe areas. Use baby gates to help you close off dangerous areas that don't have doors, including stairways. Supervise children well when they're roaming around.

, This will also prevent these items from falling on your child in the case of an earthquake other other disaster.

, Toddlers will trip and fall often, but will do so less if the floor is clean and free of debris. Vacuuming and dusting often will also prevent toddlers from getting as many allergic reactions and other respiratory illnesses.

Remove junk food from the house.,
Read all labels closely.,
Avoid prepackaged food as often as possible.,
Eliminate sugary drinks.",How to Limit Your Toddler's Sugar Intake1," One way to limit the amount of sugar your toddler eats is to keep all junk food out of the house. Your child won’t have access to them, so eventually they will be less likely to ask for them if they are not around and they don’t see them.Designate a cheat day for your toddler, where they get treats they like. This can be a weekend day, like a Saturday, or an after dinner treat. Let your toddler have a treat on these days so they won't feel completely deprived.
Get rid of all sugar beverages, cakes, sugar cereals, donuts, muffins, cookies, and candy from your house. Also limit sugary items that seem like they are healthy, such as dried fruit and granola with added sugars and high fructose corn syrup.
Instead, replace all those foods with healthier options for your toddler. Try unsweetened applesauce, fruit in natural juices with no added sugar or syrups, and animal crackers. You should also keep fruit around.;
, If you are trying to limit sugars, reading labels is a must. Sugar is added to so many foods, even foods you wouldn’t suspect. Plus, sugar comes in many different forms, such as high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, maltose, sucrose, and cane syrup. Look for no-sugar-added foods, and read labels to check for sugar content and if it has been added.Sugar is added to just about everything, from juice to dressings, cereal, and crackers to dried fruit. Even if you don’t think it has sugar, read the label.
For most products, you can find a brand that has the same item that hasn’t been filled with a bunch of unnecessary sugar.
Beware of labels that say “natural,” “organic,” or something similar. They can still have added sugars, trans fat, and other unhealthy ingredients.

, It is extremely difficult to find prepackaged food that doesn’t contain sugar. To help reduce the sugar in your family’s diet, make as much food at home as you can.For example, pasta sauces sometimes contain high amounts of sugar. Instead of buying prepackaged sauces, make your own from scratch where you don’t add any sugar. You can also try making your own granola, fruit strips, and sauces.

, Beverages are one of the most common ways that people pack the sugar into their diet. Soda, energy drinks, and juices are packed with sugars. These sugary drinks have been found to increase the risk of childhood obesity. Instead of these drinks, give your toddler water or low-fat milk.You can add no-sugar added chocolate powder to milk to make a low-sugar version of chocolate milk.

"
"
Serve healthy snacks.,
Limit the amount of fruit your child eats.,
Bake treats at home.,
Give your child juice rarely.",How to Limit Your Toddler's Sugar Intake2," Replace your child’s sugary snacks with healthier options. Your child will learn to eat the healthier snacks and won’t ask for the sugary junk food if they’ve never had it. Even if they complain at first, eventually the new habit will form and they will get used to their new snacks.Try healthy sweet snacks like fruit, yogurt with no or low amounts of sugar, and raisins with no sugar added. Get your toddler to help you make trail mix without candy, marshmallows, or candied fruit. Serve them natural peanut butter with no sugar or hydrogenated oils added.
Provide your child with snacks that are savory instead of sweet, like whole grain crackers, cut up vegetables, hummus, guacamole, salsa, cheese sticks and slices, slices of avocado, and air popped popcorn.

, Whole fruit is healthier, but too much can provide too much sugar. To help make sure your child isn’t eating too much sugar from fruit, only feed your child one to two servings per day.Go for fruits with the lowest sugar content, like berries, peaches, kiwis, and pears. Limit the amount of high sugar fruits, like grapes, pineapple, and super sweet apples.
A serving of fruit is a small apple, one cup of fruit, or a banana.

, You don’t have to eliminate cookies, cakes, or muffins from your child’s diet completely. Instead, make cookies, cakes, and muffins from scratch. This helps you remove the sugar content by substituting pureed fruit, honey, or skipping the sugar completely. You won’t add unnecessary cups of sugar, high fructose corn syrup, or other chemically processed sugars to your homemade cookies.Don’t buy prepackaged ready to bake cookies, or cake and muffin mixes. Most brands still contain sugars, high fructose corn syrup, along with other unhealthy additives like trans fats.

, Most juices are full of added sugars and high fructose corn syrup. Even no sugar added or 100% fruit juices provide a concentrated amount of sugar that can be too much for your child. Give your child juice only occasionally, limiting it to around four ounces of no sugar added each day.Try diluting the juice with water to reduce the sugar content.

Determine a time when sweets are okay.,
Explain your rules to anyone who keeps your child.,
Track your child’s sugar intake.",How to Limit Your Toddler's Sugar Intake3," You shouldn’t eliminate sweet treats from your child’s diet completely. However, you should teach your child there are times when sweets are okay, but they are not allowed all the time. You may teach the children that sweets are okay during dessert after dinner, but not during the day or at the grocery store.You may also let your kids know that if you go somewhere, like on vacation or to a carnival, one treat is allowed then.
Tell your child, “We have a rule where sweets are only allowed after dinner, not between meals.”

, Just because your child is at their grandparents, daycare, or a friend’s house doesn’t mean they get a free pass on sugar. Talk to the people who will be keeping your child. Explain that you do not allow them to have sugary sweets as snacks.Discuss what snack options your child will be given, then tell the other person what you do not want your child eating. If they offer a lower sugar option, like animal crackers, choose that option.
Provide your own healthier, low-sugar snacks if you have to.

, You may not realize how much sugar you and your child are eating until you track it. Many apps or websites offer nutrition counters that will track the amount of sugar your child has each day. This can help you adjust accordingly.Track all foods, including vegetables, fruits, and sauces. This will give you a more accurate picture of your child’s sugar intake.
Examples of these types of apps include MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, and Cron-o-meter.

Take your child’s temperature to determine if he/she has a fever.,
Observe your child for signs of lethargy or persistent crying.,
Check your child for a rash or skin disease.,
Keep your child home if he/she is vomiting and/or has diarrhea.",How to Know when Your Toddler Is Too Sick for Daycare," Most daycare centers do not accept a child with a fever, however some pediatricians and parents argue about what constitutes a fever.


Dr. Len Leshin, MD, FAAP says that fever is considered to be a temperature of 100 F degrees (37.8 C) in infants and small children; 99.3 F degrees (37.4 C) or higher in school aged children. Check your daycare center guidelines for temperatures considered to be unacceptable.
Use an accurate thermometer to measure your child’s temperature. The old “gold” standard has been the glass thermometer, however modern day digital and ear thermometers may provide an accurate reading and less drama and risk (can be taken by placing underneath the arm or under the tongue in older children).
Consider keeping your child home even if he/she has a borderline fever. Some parents are tempted to give their child Tylenol and still send him/her to daycare. However doing this will only expose other children (and teachers/caregivers) to the virus at daycare and possibly make your child feel worse if he/she isn’t resting.;
, While it may be difficult to determine if your child is having a typical toddler meltdown or if he/she is sick, observe your child for out of the ordinary, uncharacteristic behavior.


Completely unreasonable behavior for your child. If your child seems to be throwing a fit over everything (and typically does not do this) he/she may be on the verge of getting sick. If he/she doesn’t seem to get better after a nap or a snack, take his/her temperature to see if a low grade fever could be present.
Having bathroom accidents after being toilet trained for some time. Early potty trained children may have an accident or two as they learn to master toilet training, however if your preschool aged child has suddenly reverted back to soiling his/her pants seek medical attention for a possible urinary tract or kidney infection.
Exhaustion or lethargy to the point where he/she cannot stand or sit for a period of time. In cases where your child is pale, has difficulty breathing and is very lethargic, bring him/her to the doctor immediately to ensure he doesn’t have a serious condition.

, Communicable diseases may be presented in the form of a skin rash or break out. In most cases, if your child shows up feeling fine but with a rash or an oozing, crusting eye he/she will most likely be sent home to avoid spreading disease.


Head lice. A common pest often passed from youngster to youngster, head lice may look like dandruff or hair spray droplets but are actually nits that may become an adult louse, which resembles a sesame seed.
Pink eye. Pink eye otherwise known as conjunctivitis is inflamed membranes within the eye that may ooze or produce puss. You child may complain that his/her eye is painful and itchy, also he/she may be sensitive to light.
Chicken pox or measles/mumps. Although most children are vaccinated for these diseases, chicken pox, measles and mumps is a raised, inflamed rash that typically begins on the trunk or face. All three diseases are highly contagious.
Pinworms. Pinworms may cause your child to have an upset stomach and an itchy bottom. Pinworms are detected by shining a flashlight toward your child’s rectum while he/she is sleeping (they appear in dark places). If your child has pinworms you’ll see a small, white worm appear.

, Most schools or centers will not accept a child who has been throwing up or has diarrhea. Not only for the sake of the preschool or daycare center but also for your child’s comfort.


Wait 24 hours after the last instance before sending your child back to school. Keep your child home for at least 24 hours so that he/she can gather strength and get back to normal before returning to school. Also, your child should not be contagious 24 hours following the last time he/she threw up or had a loose bowel movement.

Get your toddler into a regular daily routine.,
Spend some time with your toddler outdoors.,
Establish a consistent bedtime routine.,
Be mindful of your child’s food intake before bedtime.,
Think and work as a team.,
Don't get into the habit of staying with your toddler until he falls asleep.,
Be firm with your toddler.",How to Improve Your Toddler's Sleeping Habits1," It's a good idea to stick to a daily routine, as this will help your child to adjust to a certain pattern and will make implementing a strict bedtime a lot easier.


A well-timed lunch followed by an afternoon nap, fixed and regular study hours, evening games and a timely dinner will make the life of your children much more systematic and meaningful. This complete list of activities should end up in a firm bedtime and a peaceful sleep.
This discipline in terms of routine will help your toddler to sleep soundly while also enjoying all the moments of health and happiness while they are awake.;
, Create a schedule of regular evening outdoor activities. Take your child out for a healthy walk, make him/her learn swimming in the kid’s swimming pool, instill in them the desire to learn new outdoor activities and games.


Spending too much time inside watching TV or playing games on their play station will not only cause weakness and less agility, but will also prevent the toddler from getting a good night's, because staring at screens will make them too stimulated to sleep.

, Like your daily activity plan, it is also important to institute a bedtime routine.


Activities such as drinking a warm glass of milk, brushing teeth, having a warm bath or reading a bedtime story and topping it off with a simple prayer, creates a peaceful transition from waking to sleep.
Also,if you can maintain a consistent bedtime routine, your child’s wake up and bedtime schedule will become regular thanks to their body’s biological clock.

, The food that we give our children does not just affect their health, but also contributes to a restful sleep.


Proper timing of the meals along with the healthiness of the food is very important, not only for the health of the kids but also for a sound and quiet sleep. Avoid giving your child sweets or anything with high sugar content just before you plan to bring them to bed. Remember that when sugar spikes, it will lead to difficulty in sleeping as the child will experience a sugar rush and become full of energy.
A balanced diet and timely consumption of the evening meal is highly recommended. Make sure the child is getting plenty of vegetables and fruits, along with healthy proteins and carbohydrates.

, You, as parents, have to understand the sleep requirements of toddlers aside from their other needs in life. You must take into account the amount of time they require for sleep in order to get up and feel rested in the morning.


You must work as a team to support each other with the purpose of creating a quiet environment that's conducing for your child going to sleep at a reasonable hour. Remember, your toddler will always follow your example.
It is not realistic to expect him to sleep soundly while you are watching a famous TV show or enjoying a newly released blockbuster movie. The toddler is bound to resist the need to sleep as his mind will be consistently hovering over what is happening outside his room.

, Minimize your presence by leaving the room before the toddler dozes off, but don’t lie in the child’s bed or interact with the kid. Move farther away from the bed each night as the toddler falls asleep to gradually reduce dependence on you.


Establish a sense of security by reassuring the toddler of another presence in the room such as a nearby goldfish a night light, or a favorite teddy bear.
Keep your promise as when you commit to come back to the room in a while to check on the toddler. Allot longer intervals, starting with a 5-10 minute waiting period.

, If your toddler sneaks out of the room, accompany him or her back without much interaction. Being firm is important.


Give the toddler a ""bedtime pass"" that will allow them to leave their room just once a night to ask for anything they need or. For some, the pass can be a replacement for crying or calling out to get attention.
Reward good behavior, such as giving the child his favorite cereal or picking a favorite outfit the following morning, and ignore the undesirable ones like crying or slipping out of the room.

Avoid visiting guests late at night.,
Create a peaceful environment at home.,
Set up the mood to sleep.,
Create a cozy room.",How to Improve Your Toddler's Sleeping Habits2," We all like to socialize and move around for various gatherings and dinners. Notwithstanding the importance of these gatherings and visits, parents must ensure that they head back to their homes in time for bedtime.


Late night parties, functions and other family events badly affect the toddler's routine and disturbs their sleeping patterns. The adults must ensure that all such visits or gatherings finish up early in the night so that the kids (along with other family members of course) can get to sleep at their normal time.
It's important to be aware that disrupting your child's sleeping patterns not only affects the mood of the kids but also lowers their performance capabilities.

, The most important thing the parents must focus on is to ensure a peaceful, friendly and comforting environment at home.


A child who is stressed due to any quarrels between the parents will sleep poorly or and be more inclined to have bad dreams than a child who is surrounded by a happy, loving environment.

, There are a few regular tasks like brushing the teeth, praying, taking a warm bath and reading a book ,etc. which kids have to do before they sleep.


Parents must start these tasks with their kids about an hour before they they get the young ones to settle down in their beds. These activities set the mood for sleep

, Set up your child’s room to be as comfortable as possible. Remember that a bedroom should be quiet, with proper ventilation and dark at night.


Do not place a television in the room. Do not fall into the habit of allowing your child to watch television to fall asleep. This will only disrupt their sleep and possible cause nightmares.
Another thing that you need to keep in mind is not to stuff the room with your child’s favorite toys. You can give them a blanket, stuffed toy or teddy bear that they consider, but too many toys can be distracting. The room should always have a positive and soothing feel.

Consider using touch and lullaby therapy.,
First, you must ask your child’s permission.,
Consider a little rough-housing.,
Give the massage during story time.,
Use long, firm massage strokes.,
Use some specific massage techniques.,
Sing your toddler a lullaby.",How to Improve Your Toddler's Sleeping Habits3," Aside from reading your child a story to get them to sleep, you may also want to consider touch or lullaby therapy.


Massage has been a favorite therapy due to its healing and balancing powers. Studies show that it also helps promote a regular sleeping pattern.
But before you engage on this, here are some tips on how it should be done.

, Be prepared, as toddlers love to say “no!” It will help if you give the kid a choice such as asking if he or she wants her legs or back (or any other body part) massaged.


Toddlers like the feeling of being in-charge so they have to be involved in receiving the message rather than just having the massage done to them.

, You may involve Dad by incorporating some tumbling and wrestling games. But these shouldn’t be too wild if your intention is to put the tot to sleep. Although they aren’t massage in the strict sense, they still provide opportunity for touch and physical closeness.

, Story time before going to sleep is an ideal time to give the massage. You may be creative by involving the characters in the massage process.


For instance, if a dog is walking in the story, you may walk your fingers over the toddler’s body.
Think of different finger movements for the various action words found in the story.

, Generally, it is best to use smooth, long, slow movements and to repeat every stroke used a few times. Firm pressure is also said to be more calming than light stroke.


Use natural oil like those from grape seed or sweet almond. Gel, lotion or cream are options as well.
The duration of the massage may be from 20 seconds to 20 minutes. This will depend on your toddler’s personality and mood at that time.
Allow your child to massage you too. Let him or her think of his or her own techniques as this may be a way of expressing love to you.

, The following techniques are also suggested for the different body parts :


Have the toddler’s thigh wrapped in your hand, then slide your hand going to the ankle. Repeat it with your other hand, one hand following the other, following a smooth rhythm.
Using your thumbs with firm pressure, rub the sole of the foot, from heel to toes. Rub each toe, identifying each toe as “This Little Piggy…"" Roll the kid’s leg between the palms of your hands.
With flat hands, do paddling strokes on the tummy from the rib line to the hips. With flat fingertips, make clockwise circles on the tummy.
Lay your hands on the chest, then stroke in an outward movement and back to your starting point, as if drawing a heart on the child’s chest.
For the back, use the same movements as on the chest. With your hands across the back, stroke in opposite directions.

, Lullabies around the world follow a similar tempo, one that matches the tempo of a human heartbeat. Love is nurtured and communicated when a lullaby is sung, hummed or played. It provides comfort to children and makes young toddlers feel secure when going to sleep.

Ask for an assessment of range of motion.,
Ask for a balance and coordination evaluation.,
Ask for safe exercise suggestions.",How to Help Your Chronically Ill Toddler Exercise1," If your child has an illness that causes muscle atrophy or restrictive movements, certain activities involved in exercise may not be advisable.


For instance, if your child has permanently contracted hand muscles, exercise involving throwing or grabbing is likely to frustrate your toddler.;
, Most pediatricians can give reliable opinions on the safety of exercise options that involve balance and coordination, such as dancing, jumping, bicycling, and running.


If your toddler’s illness affects balance or coordination, exercises that rely heavily on these characteristics may be dangerous for your child.

, In some cases, most exercise for your toddler should be first demonstrated by a physical therapist and then repeated with your guidance during exercise sessions.


Children with less restrictive illnesses may be able to safely engage in a wide variety of exercise options when they are feeling well. Your child’s symptoms will be the guide of how much and what types of exercise are appropriate.

Help your toddler stretch in place.,
Do arm and leg lifts with your toddler.,
Swim with your toddler.,
Help your toddler ride a low-set tricycle.,
Rest frequently with your child.",How to Help Your Chronically Ill Toddler Exercise2," Teaching your child to stretch as a precursor to exercise can not only help prevent injury but also increase your child’s range of motion and strengthen muscles.


Perform simple stretches by stretching each arm individually across the chest and holding it in place with the other, or sitting in place and reaching for the toes.

, If your child is restricted to a bed or wheel-chair but is able to move his or her limbs, show your toddler how to alternate lifting 1 arm or 1 leg at a time.


Make it a game by “reaching for apples” or “kicking at balls” to make these simple exercises more interesting and engaging. Perform multiple sets of 5 to 10 repetitions each if your child is able.

, Swimming helps strengthen muscles and confidence while relieving stress on joints.


If your child’s doctor believes that swimming is safe for your child, join a parent-toddler swim class at a local gym or take your toddler to swim with you at a community pool.

, Small plastic tricycles are often very stable and low to the ground, reducing the chance of a fall.


Tricycles help your child build lower body strength and stabilizer muscles that assist balance.

, Regardless of your child’s illness, it is likely advisable to encourage him or her to rest frequently. Inform daycare or childcare centers of your child’s illness and the importance of appropriate intervals of rest during play and exercise.

"
"
Dance to music or movies.,
Encourage playground games.,
Invent your own play-time games with appropriate exercises.",How to Help Your Chronically Ill Toddler Exercise3," Children can get lots of physical activity in dancing to music or following sing-alongs and musical children’s videos.


If your child is capable of safe dancing, encourage him or her to dance to the radio or to CDs or DVDs.

, If your child’s chronic illness does not restrict motion, encourage your child to play with other children in regular activities as often as possible.


Playing tag, swinging, and using the slide are all effective workouts for children and can also help them build social skills with other children.
If your child’s illness does not permit rigorous play or much interaction, take your child to the park when it is less crowded and push him or her on the swing, hold your toddler up to “play” at the monkey bars, or walk through the park before having a picnic. Walking can be sufficient exercise for toddlers with restrictive illnesses.

, If your child’s mobility or strength is severely limited, make up your own play-time exercise games that your child can safely perform.


For instance, play pretend symphony conductors by waving arms to music, race to stack cardboard blocks into a building, or play a horizontal “jumping” game with a bedridden toddler to see who can push a pillow the farthest by bending and extending the legs.

If you live in a hot climate, a flat sheet may be all your child needs to stay warm at night.;
, When buying toddler bedding, think about how you want your toddler to be as comfortable as possible when sleeping on it. You’ll want something soft, and nice and smooth; something that will entice your toddler to sleep on her own bed. In particular, look for bedding made of micro fleece, a comforter made of combed cotton.


Micro fleece is a synthetic wool material that is often made of polyester. It is soft, light and easy to wash. It is also hydrophobic (water repellent) and holds only 1% of its weight in water hence it is easy to wash. Micro fleece is the thinnest and most flexible among its 4 thickness variations hence it is the most breathable.
Combed cotton fabrics are generally softer but more durable than regular cotton fabrics and are often more expensive. Because of this, these comforters tend to last longer.
Another thing you will want to consider is the thread count of your bedding fabric. Consider buying toddler bedding made from percale weave. Percale weave produces fabric sheets that are smooth and soft. In the United States, authentic percale sheets need to have a minimum of 180 thread counts running in one direction per square inch of fabric. This will be written as 180TC on the packaging of the bed sheet.

, Sheet sets work well for toddler bedding because parents have the option to add or remove blankets as the seasons change. When seasons change, the weather fluctuates, which means either adding or removing a blanket from your toddler’s bed.


Beddings for toddlers and babies are sold with tog ratings; this refers to the item’s insulating capacity or thermal insulance (how warm it will keep your child). During the summer, use a doona or blanket with a tog rating of 3 to 4.5, while during the winter, use a doona with a tog rating of around 13.5.

, Are you going to use the bedding until your child’s preschool years? Will there be another younger child who will use the bedding next? If you are thinking of using the toddler bedding for a long time, you will find it is better to invest in high quality toddler bed sheets and comforters. This way, you will get the best value for your money.


Make sure the bedding is easily washable and that it doesn’t need to be dry-cleaned and won’t fall apart after the first use. It is basically inevitable that you’ll have to constantly wash your toddler’s bedding so invest in pieces that will withstand this wear and tear.

, You want to encourage your toddler to sleep in her bed as much as possible; if she loves the design on the bedding, she will be much more likely to jump into bed at night.


Look for bedding that is your child’s favorite color, or bedding that has your child’s favorite TV show character on it.

, It is generally better to get sheets that are too big, rather than too small, but you should still try to match the sheets to the bed exactly. Use a tape measure to determine the size of your child’s bed, and take this information to the store with you.


If you do happen to get sheets that are too big, you can either bring them back, or simply tuck the extra fabric under the mattress when you make your child’s bed.

, Toddlers can manage to cause a lot of damage to their bedding. Whether your toddler jumps on the bedding, spills food on it, or wets the bed at night, it is generally useful to have a second bedding set waiting in the wings.

, Almost every department or baby store has a section with toddler bedding. Online retailers also tend to have a large selection of bedding options. Choose a store that matches your style and price range. The simplest way to buy toddler bedding is simply to get a bedding set, which typically includes coordinating sheets, comforter, and pillowcase. You can also buy each piece individually to create your own look or to mix and match brands and styles.

Buy a bed for your toddler.,
Purchase a crib mattress (if you don’t already have one).,
Get a waterproof mattress pad.,
Get a pillow for your child.",How to Buy Quality Toddler Bedding2," The basis of a good and safe night’s sleep is a quality bed. Toddler beds are the same size as cribs and use crib-sized mattress to create a cozy area for your child. In fact, many new cribs can be converted into toddler beds, so check with your crib’s manufacturer to see if your model can be converted. Toddler beds should have side rails to stop kids from rolling out of bed. These beds come in all materials and styles, from the traditional wood frame to a fun plastic racecar bed.There isn’t one particular type of toddler bed that is better than another—as long as the bed is new and meets current safety regulations, it should work well for your child. Look for the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (JPMA) safety seal on the bed box to know it is safe.

, Because toddler beds use crib mattresses, you should be able to keep using the mattress from your child’s crib. Make sure the mattress is firm and doesn’t have any holes or tears in the fabric.


If you need to buy a new mattress, make sure it fits snuggly into the bed frame. There are a variety of options for material and style of mattresses, so choose one that is in your price range and that is comfortable for your child.

, This will help to protect your child’s mattress, especially during potty training. If you had a mattress pad on your child’s crib, it should be sufficient for your toddler’s bed.


Mattress pads are generally much easier to wash and clean than the entire mattress underneath.

, Start your child with a smaller pillow, such as a travel or toddler-sized pillow, and then move to a standard size when they are ready and comfortable.


To reduce the risk of suffocating, pillows should be firm and have a snug-fitting pillowcase.
Flatter pillows can give children the support they need without hurting their necks.
Feather pillows can be difficult for children with allergies, so look for a pillow made of 100% cotton or 100% polyester.

Hold it over the the child's ear, and it can help to ease pain. Just make sure it's not hot, as you may end up causing pain or burns., Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications can help ease the pain of an ear infection or discomfort caused by fever. Typically, ibuprofen and acetaminophen are the best options for this type of pain. These medications can also help if your child is running a fever.Don't give aspirin to children under 19, as this has been linked to a serious and potentially fatal condition called Reye's Syndrome.
Follow the guidelines on the packaging for the weight of your child. Dosages are based on weight. Make sure to weigh your child if you don't know their weight.
Make sure you are using children's versions of OTC medication for your child. Also, it's always best to check with your doctor before giving your child medications, particularly if this is your first time giving them to your child.

, Another option is using anesthetic drops. These drops are not the same as antibiotic drops. They don't treat the infection itself. Rather, they just help to dull the pain. You can find these drops at most drug stores, and you just drop a few drops into your child's ear.Follow the directions on the bottle for how many drops and how often you should give this medication to your child.

, Drinking fluids will help keep your child hydrated, which is good in itself, but it also provides another benefit with ear infections: the swallowing action encourages the fluid to move out of the ear, easing the infection. Encourage your child to drink lots of water, broth, and drinks like Pedialyte while they have the infection., Some ear infections develop from colds. However, you shouldn't give your child cold medications like decongestants, as they won't really help the ear infection. In addition, they can be dangerous for children., If you notice symptoms of an ear infection, it's a good idea to at least call your child's pediatrician. Your child should definitely see the doctor if you notice symptoms for more than a day or two, you see discharge from their ears (such as blood or pus), or you notice your child is particularly cranky after they've had a cold. Also, take your child in if the ear pain seems particularly severe.Symptoms of an ear infection include ear pain (noticeable if the child pulls at their ear), crankiness, trouble sleeping, hearing issues, headache, ear drainage, fever over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), losing balance more often, and/or losing their appetite. Ear infections often hurt more when the child is lying down.

, Standard practice now dictates waiting two to three days to see if an ear infection will clear up before prescribing antibiotics if symptoms are not severe. The reason doctors prefer to wait is most infections will clear up on their own, and waiting means antibiotics won't be over-prescribed in this instance.If your child has too many rounds of antibiotics, they can have bacteria that become resistant to them, meaning they won't be as effective.
However, if your child's symptoms are severe, antibiotics may be appropriate right away. Severe symptoms include sweating, high fever, a fast heartbeat, extreme tiredness, and severe pain. In addition, if your child is under two and the infection is in both ears, that's also an appropriate time for antibiotics.If your child shows any complications from an ear infection, such as a ruptured ear drum, or spread of infection outside of the ear, your doctor will want to treat the infection right away. If your child has pink-eye along with an ear infection, your doctor will also likely want to treat this with antibiotics.
If your doctor does prescribe antibiotics, you should finish the entire treatment course as prescribed. Don't stop giving your child antibiotics mid-treatment because they feel better.

, If your child is still showing symptoms after a couple of days, particularly if they still have a fever, it's best to talk to your child's doctor again. Also, if your child's symptoms seem to be getting worse, rather than better, talk to your doctor again. The doctor may want to put your child on antibiotics if they haven't been on them or on a different kind if your child has been on them., While you can't prevent your child from getting all colds and infections, try to keep your child away when you know someone is sick. Colds and respiratory infections can lead to ear infections, so limiting sickness can help limit ear infections. That includes making sure your child gets all the recommended vaccinations, including the flu vaccination.Make sure you wash your hands regularly, especially when around your child.

, If your child has allergies, they are more likely to develop ear infections. Try using a humidifier in your child's room when their allergies are bad to help thin out mucus. In addition, talk to your child's doctor about solutions for your child's allergies such as avoidance of allergy triggers, environmental methods, and medications.Watch for allergies as the seasons change, in particular.

, When your child is sleeping, check to see if they snore or breathe through their mouth. If they do, that could mean your child has large adenoids, which in turn could mean they may develop ear infections more frequently.Some children may need surgery to fix this condition.

, Your house should be smoke free, anyway, since it's not healthy for your children. Smoke can also cause an increase in ear infections in your child; therefore, try to make sure your child isn't exposed to secondhand smoke."

Make eye cleaning part of your regular routine.",How to Clean a Toddler's Eyes," You want to be prepared before you sit your toddler down, since he is unlikely to have much patience for this process. Here's what you'll need:At least one soft washcloth (preferably two)
Warm water. It's best to do this near a sink, so you can rinse the cloth if needed
No-tears soap or shampoo
If your child has an eye infection, you’ll need disposable tissues, rather than washcloths;
, Ask your child to keep still while you clean her eyes. To help her, try to limit distractions. It can also be uncomfortable for a toddler to have her eyes cleaned, so try to make the space a little cozy. If you’re planning to do this in the kitchen or bathroom, put down a soft towel for her to sit or lie down on.
Make sure there is enough light for you to see, but not so much that it feels blinding to your child.
Make sure the space is quiet, or put on some music that your toddler finds relaxing.
Put away tablets, phones, or any other technology that might cause your child to get antsy.

, Toddlers are used to being picked up, dressed, and bathed, but having you rub their eyes can seem scary if they’ve never experienced it before. Speak in a soft, calming tone to help him relax. Reassure him that you’ll be very gentle, and the process will be short and won’t hurt at all.
Let him know that this is an important part of staying healthy, like brushing his teeth or washing his hands.
If you plan to reward him afterward with a treat or a fun activity, let him know. This may help him endure the process if he finds it unpleasant.

, If your hands are dirty, you could be doing more harm than good. You could accidentally be spreading bacteria or dirt to your child's eyes. To avoid this, use proper hand washing procedure. Wet your hands with clean, running water, then turn off the tap.
Apply soap to your hands and rub them together to create a lather.
Be sure to lather the back of hands, as well as underneath your fingernails and between your fingers.
Rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds. You can sing the song ""Happy Birthday"" twice to time yourself.
Rinse your hands again under clean water to remove the soap.
Dry your hands on a clean towel.

, Wring it out to remove excess water. The washcloth should be clean and soft. A toddler's face is very sensitive, so even a cloth that you think is soft can feel abrasive to her. If your toddler is nervous, you can rub the washcloth on her cheek or the back of her hand to let her feel how soft it is.
Toddlers can be sensitive to temperature, so you can also let her feel the temperature of the water before putting it on her face. Ask your child if the temperature feels okay to her.
Make sure the washcloth is not too wet. You don't want to drip water all over her face.

, Lying down is ideal, because he's less likely to move his head around too much. However, any position in which he's willing to stay still will work.

, You can wipe from the nose outward, or from the outside toward the nose. Wiping from the nose outward can make it easier to keep contact with the skin if the child turns her head away, but either direction is perfectly safe., Even if one eye appears clean, it’s good to clean both eyes. If your child has an eye infection, be sure to always use a new tissue for each eye. This prevents spreading the infection from one eye to the other. Dispose of tissues immediately afterward.
If using a washcloth, rinse the washcloth with fresh water after wiping each eye.

, Toddlers' skin is very sensitive, so use a very small amount of soap and dilute it with water before applying it to the child's face. Use only gentle, no-tears soap or shampoo.


Make sure the child closes his eyes, so that the soap does not get inside his eyelids. This can irritate the eyes.
Wipe the eyes in one direction, rather than in a circle or back and forth. This prevents soap from getting in his eyes.

, Your child may lose her patience and get antsy. Let her know that the more still they can stay, the faster the process will be. Maintain a gentle approach, even if the cleaning becomes difficult. , This will remove any remaining soap or shampoo. If you haven't used soap, simply make sure your toddler's eyes now look clean and clear. If you have a second, dry washcloth, wet part of it with warm water. Wipe the child's eyes with this cloth to help remove any remaining soap.
Use the dry part of this washcloth to wipe his eyes dry once the soap is removed.

, Make sure she knows that you appreciate her cooperation. You may want to reward her with a fun activity, or a special treat.You can ask your toddler how the process went for her. If she complains that the washcloth was to rough, consider finding a softer one for next time. If the water was too cold, tell her you'll try warmer water in the future.
Whether you're promising rewards, or a change in the process, be sure to follow through on any promises you make.

, Sometimes toddlers get a little crust around their eyes, or their eyes water a bit and it's perfectly normal. However, if your child is uncomfortable from discharge coming from his eyes, he may have an infection or allergies. Some common causes of eye discharge are:Common colds
Seasonal allergies
Irritants in the air (e.g. perfumes, dust, pet dander, and smoke)
Conjunctivitis (commonly known as pink eye)
A foreign body such as an eyelash or dirt or sand in the eye

, Many of the causes of eye discharge don't require prescription medication. However, it’s always best to get a professional diagnosis. Eye infections can be serious and quite contagious, and should be addressed immediately. You should see your child's doctor if there is a lot of drainage or drainage that doesn't go away in a day or two. Also if your child has eye pain, redness, or swelling, or if your child may have gotten something in her eye or has had an injury or scratch to the eye.
If your child has a cold or seasonal allergies, over the counter medications may help clear up the eye discharge as they address your child's other symptoms.
Only use eye drops or ointments when specifically recommended or prescribed by your child's doctor.

, Not all causes of eye discharge are contagious. For example, children can't catch seasonal allergies from each other. However, some infections can be highly contagious, and very uncomfortable to toddlers (and their parents).Wash all linens and clothing frequently to prevent the infection from being spread to other children in your home or at school. This can also help eliminate allergens like pollen and dander, which may be a cause of eye discharge.
If your toddler does have an eye infection, he may need to stay away from playmates until the infection clears, usually 24 hours after he begins treatment. Your pediatrician can tell you if your child has an infection that is contagious, such as conjunctivitis.

, Get your toddler used to having her eyes cleaned regularly. This can help her avoid the discomfort of watery or crusty eyes, and help keep her healthy. Cleaning your toddler's eyes can be easily integrated into a morning or evening routine such as bath time or tooth brushing.
Like mouths and noses, eyes are a great way for bacteria to enter the body, so even a healthy child should have her eyes cleaned daily.

You can adopt a child born in the U.S. or one born in a different country. If you’re worried about a birth mother changing her mind, you might want an international adoption.
You can adopt a baby or an older child.
You can adopt a child that is the same race and religion as you, or not. Depending on your choices, you might have to wait longer.
You can adopt a family member or a stepchild. You’ll work with a lawyer to complete this process.;
, Many people seeking a domestic adoption will work with an adoption agency. You can find a list of agencies at the state’s Department of Family and Protective Services website: http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Adoption_and_Foster_Care/Adoption_Partners/private.asp. Agencies differ, so you always want to call and talk to someone before sending in an application. Check the following:


Are they certified by the state?
Can you get references from parents who adopted?
What are the costs? Some agencies offer sliding-scale fees, depending on your income.

, If you’re interested in an international adoption, then you should get an agency that specializes in them. Most children adopted from abroad come from Eastern Europe, Asia, or Latin America.

International adoptions are much more complicated than domestic ones. You’ll probably need to travel to the foreign country, perhaps multiple times. Ask if the agency has someone who will travel with you who speaks the language.
Check whether the agency has been accredited by the Council on Accreditation., Texas has over three thousand foster children who are available for adoption.They range in age from infancy to 18 years of age. You should contact DFPS if you are interested in adopting a foster child.

Many foster children have special emotional, physical, and medical needs. Families who adopt special needs children may qualify for adoption assistance., If you want to adopt a stepchild or a family member, the adoption process is a little different than the process described in this article, but a lawyer will help you. All other adoptive parents might benefit from working with an adoption attorney as well.

You can get a referral by contacting the Texas Bar Association at 800-252-9690, Monday through Friday, 8:30 am to 4:30 pm.You can also find Texas adoption attorneys at the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys website: http://www.adoptionattorneys.org/aaaa/state-directory/tx-texas.

, Ask agencies about their eligibility requirements. They may have different requirements regarding age and religion.If you want to adopt a foster child, then you must be at least 21 years of age.

, Get comfortable with the requirements before you start the process. If you’re interested in working with a private agency, then call one up and ask any questions that you have. You should also ask for written information about their adoption program.DFPS puts on an information session for those interested in adopting foster children. Visit https://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Adoption_and_Foster_Care/Get_Started/Information_Meetings/default.asp to find a session near you.

, Each private agency sets its own fees, so ask for written policies ahead of time. Review them carefully and ask questions if you have any. Financial disputes between adoptive parents and agencies are the most common disputes. Don’t sign up with an agency unless all of your concerns are addressed., DFPS and private adoption agencies will ask for basic information to start. For example, you will need to provide information about your age, education, employment, and income. There may be an application fee., Throughout history, closed adoptions were the norm. You never knew the birth parents’ identities, and they didn’t know yours. After the adoption, you had no contact with them.Things are different today. You can certainly still choose a closed adoption, but you should consider an open adoption.
Open adoptions vary. For example, you might exchange letters or cards, or even meet yearly. It’s up to you, but you should give serious thought to how much involvement you want with the birth family before getting too far in the adoption process.

, Parents adopting foster children must attend a PRIDE training program, which stands for Parent Resource Information Development Education. The course covers topics such as loss and grief, child attachment, and how adoption affects a family., You’ll have to provide the case worker with information about your family. Check what you need to provide. Typically, you’ll need to provide birth certificates for every family member, along with a marriage certificate if you are married.Ask for a checklist so you can get documents in a timely manner.

You’ll probably also have to provide references. Choose people who know your family well, such as your neighbors or a faith leader.

, The social worker will also need to walk through your home to make sure it is safe enough for a child to live with you. Prepare by walking through and correcting any obvious hazards, such as exposed wires or broken windows.

Make sure dangerous chemicals are stored safely outside the reach of children.
Store firearms properly in locked cases, and keep the ammunition separate from the firearms.Clean the house as best you can. Remove trash, old magazines, cigarette butts, and animal droppings.
If the social worker identifies problems, you can work to fix them.

, You’ll discuss a variety of topics at the meeting, such as the following:Why you want to adopt and how everyone in your family feels about the adoption.
Any health problems you or family members have.
Your family relationships, including your marriage.
Your thoughts on disciplining children.
Your memories of your own childhood, including any history of abuse or neglect.

, DFPS must perform a criminal background check on adults in the household. They will also need to perform an abuse/neglect check, to see if any allegations of abuse have been lodged against any adult.For these purposes, an adult is someone 14 or older who either lives in the house or regularly visits it., Once the agency approves you, you must sign a contract. Review this document carefully, and show it to a lawyer if you have questions., The selection process will differ, depending on the type of adoption you are pursuing. If you are adopting a child in state custody, you can look for children at the DFPS website here: https://www.dfps.state.tx.us/application/TARE/Search.aspx/Children.

, Once you have completed all of the pre-placement and home study requirements, DFPS or your adoption agency will make arrangements for you to bring your child home.


Generally, mothers have up to 10 days to revoke their consent. However, they can choose to give irrevocable consent, meaning they can’t take it back., The judge will need to sign off on the adoption decree after a hearing. Generally, the child will have to live for you for six months, but the court might waive the requirement if it’s in the child’s best interests.You and your spouse, as well as your children, should all attend. The judge will ask you a few basic questions and review the file to ensure everything is in order.

, Complete a certificate of adoption form, which you can get at the district clerk’s office. It costs $25 to file and $22 to get a certified copy of the new birth certificate.If you completed an international adoption, then you should consult with an attorney.

, Your adoption agency might offer post-adoption counseling or information, including support groups you can attend.Check what is offered.

If you didn’t use an agency, you can still search for support groups on your own. Look online.

Put on a cheery face.,
Take your child to the pharmacy with you.,
Give your child choices.,
Play doctor with your toddler.,
Offer your toddler a treat.",How to Give Toddlers Medicine1," Your reactions to situations can have a big impact on how your child reacts to them. Even if you feel badly about having to give your sick tot medication, putting on a happy face and using a cheerful voice can go a long to getting your toddler to take his medication.Prepare yourself before your approach your child. Tell yourself it will be quick and painless — for both of you. Then approach your child with a big smile and a clear statement like, ""Time for medicine so you can feel better!""
Remember to keep your facial gestures in check so you don’t cue your child into the fact that taking the meds may be unpleasant. Try and keep a smile on your face as you give your child the medication. Remember to praise your child for taking his medication.;
, In some cases, you can choose the color and flavor of different medications.Instead of doing this for your child, let her choose the color and flavor at the pharmacy. This may help your toddler feel like she has control over the situation. It can also make her excited to take each dose of the medication.


Ask your doctor to prescribe a medication for your child that can have special FDA-approved color and flavor added to it.These combat the bad smell and taste of many medications. Your doctor is likely well aware of the struggles of trying to get a toddler to take bad tasting medicine, so he should have some ideas.
Take your child to the pharmacist if you are able and give her the option to choose the color and taste she wants.
Ask your child for color and flavor selections if she is too sick to take to the pharmacist. You can call the pharmacy ahead of time to find out what colors and flavors are available. Then ask your child which is her favorite.
Be aware that most over-the-counter meds can be flavored as well, even the most pungent cough medicine.
Nonetheless, despite flavoring and color, your toddler may still resist or find it unpalatable.

, Kids like to feel as though they’re in control. Letting your child make some of the simple choices about things like where and how he takes his medication can help get your toddler to take the medication.Tell your child to choose how he gets the medication. You can provide a variety of options such as a cup, syringe, or dropper.Doing this each time can keep it fun for your toddler.
Give your child the option to take his medication before or after getting dressed.
Let your toddler choose where he takes his medication. Give him a couple of options such as at the kitchen table or on the sofa while watching TV.
Make sure he knows that not taking the medication is not an option.

, Let your child pretend to give you or a stuffed animal medicine before she takes hers. This can make your toddler comfortable enough to take her own medicine.Comment on how well your child gives you or the stuffed animal the medication as well as how well either of you take it. Follow this up with, “Let’s see if you can take your medication as well as I did, Maya.”

, When it comes to giving a toddler who doesn’t want to take medication he doesn’t want to take, adding an incentive can help motivate him to take the medication. Give your child a small but special treat if he takes his medication with no problem.


Give your child a small sticker or little trinket. Consider giving gold star stickers he can put on a board of medication times. If he has a gold star for taking all of his medication, you can offer a treat like a trip to get ice cream when he feels better.Consider offering a small treat to follow the medicine with something that tastes good, like a sip of juice or popsicle for taking the medication. Make sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist if this is okay, as some medications cannot be taken with food."

Bypass your toddler’s taste buds.,
Watch TV or do another fun activity.,
Hide the medicine in food.,
Put medication into a beverage.",How to Give Toddlers Medicine2," In some cases, you may not be able to get different colors or flavors to hide the appearance or smell of the medication. If this is the case, you can aim medication away from your child’s taste buds so that the medication goes down easier.Recognize that the taste buds are concentrated on the front and center of the tongue. Place the medication towards the back of your toddler’s tongue, but not so far back that she chokes. You can also drop the medication between your child’s rear gum and the inside of the cheek, which can help the medication glide down the back of throat. This can minimize the bad taste of the medication.Consider giving your toddler an ice chip on which to suck before she takes the medication. It can help numb the taste buds so the medication goes down more smoothly. Remember to not give larger pieces of ice or entire ice cubes, which are a choking hazard., Having a fun diversion such as playing with stuffed toys, singing a favorite song, saying a rhyme, or watching TV can also help medicine go down more quickly and smoothly. This can help ease your toddler’s feelings discomfort and being out of control.Be honest with your child that he has to take medication and you know it doesn't taste good. Suggest doing something your child likes while you give the medication. Allow your toddler to choose what that is. Having something the child likes to do combined with giving him choice may be the optimal combination to get the medicine down.
Preface with something like the following example: “Hi Alla! It’s time to take your meds and I know you think it’s icky. Should we sing a song or watch your favorite DVD while you take it?”

, You can avoid any conversation about medication altogether by sneakily putting your child’s medication in a food; however, you need to check with your child’s doctor or pharmacist before doing this because some meds cannot be taken during meals or with particular foods.Mix the medication with a small amount of something tasty like chocolate syrup, pudding, applesauce, yogurt or ice cream. You can also put a small amount of the medication on a spoon with any of these and give your child a spoonful until the entire dose is gone.
Avoid putting the medication in large quantities of food so that your child doesn't need to eat much to get the full dose. A sick child won't have much of an appetite and may not want to eat an entire cup of applesauce or pudding.
Alternate between a small dose of medicine and something your child likes to eat or drink, such as a blueberry or sip of juice.
Grind down any tablets completely and sprinkle them in your child’s food so that she doesn’t choke.

, In many cases, you can also add your child’s medication to a drink he likes. As with food, check with the pediatrician or pharmacist to make sure that the medication can be mixed with a beverage.Make sure to fully grind down any pills to prevent choking. Avoid mixing the medication with a full bottle or large cup of liquid to ensure your child gets the full dose before he doesn’t want any more.
Try giving your child a spoonful of medication followed by a sip of a favorite juice or drink.

Talk to your health care provider.",How to Give Toddlers Medicine3," A child who is three years of age or older can usually understand if you explain why she needs to take medication. If your child is still having a hard time taking her medication, be honest and explain in terms that she can understand. It’s important to be honest with your child and not lie to make things better. You may find that appealing to your toddler’s sense of reasoning can help her take the medication.Tell your child you know the medicine tastes bad and that the bad taste will go away quickly if she takes it quickly and in a way you suggested.
Explain why medication will help your toddler. Asking your toddler why the medication is necessary can help start a simple conversation that may help her take the meds.
Remember to reassure your child and be honest. Say, “I know this medication tastes bad, but taking it will make you feel better.” You may want to bolster this statement by adding something tempting like, “You’ll be able to go back to the playground soon if you take your medication.”

, If your child is having difficulty taking one form of medication, see if others are available. Many companies offer their medications in liquid, capsule, and chewable options to appeal to a variety of patients. Get in contact with your doctor to see if he can prescribe a different delivery method for your child’s medication.Consider asking your doctor if you can get the medication in a higher concentration, which may mean a smaller dose.Make sure to let your child know if you change the delivery method. For example, you can say, “No more yucky pills. I got you a medicine you can drink that is purple and tastes like strawberries!”

, If your child is being especially uncooperative, enlist the help of a friend or loved one. This may not be pleasant for any of you, but it can help get the process over quickly. You should only use this method if your child is taking liquid medication to prevent choking.Have one adult hold the child sitting on her lap. This adult can use her hands to keep the toddler's hands and head from moving. With one hand, open your child’s mouth by pushing on his chin or running your fingers inside his cheek and pushing down on his lower jaw. With the other hand, insert a pre-filled syringe between your child’s teeth and drip it onto the back of the tongue. Keep your child’s mouth closed until he swallows.
Tell your child following the dose, “I’m very sorry we had to give you medicine this way. If you help out next time, we won’t have to hold you.” You may want to give your child a hug or some other type of positive reinforcement in addition to this.

, In some cases, your child may spit out or vomit her medication. If this happens, contact your health care provider and explain what happened. He can let you know the best way to proceed for you and your child.Avoid repeating a dose unless you’ve spoken to your doctor. Some medications can be given again without a problem, but even a little bit of others may be harmful.

, If all else fails, speak to your child’s doctor. She may have alternative suggestions about how to give your child the medication. The doctor may also prescribe something new that looks or tastes better or comes in a different form.Avoid forcing your child to take capsules or chewable tabs. While you can force a child to take liquid medication, capsules and chewable tabs are another story. There is a very real danger of choking and aspirating the drug into the lungs, which is a serious medical emergency.Consult with your health professional for ideas on how to give your child medicine without forcing him, which is a better idea than forcing medication on a resistant child.

Grandparents may especially be torn between loyalty to their birth child and concern for their grandchild. Aunts and uncles are usually closer in age to the birth parent, but taking in a niece or nephew can change the dynamic in marriages and existing families. If the child is old enough to have a relationship with her birth parents, there may be issues of separation and abandonment. Prospective kinship parents should consider family counseling sessions before committing to an adoption.
If the child came to your family via a court case, discuss kinship adoption with the child's social worker. Make sure you understand the state's role in the adoption.;
, A kinship adoption is different than other types because it requires people that you know personally, the natural parents, both consent, die, or be declared unfit. There may be competing interests between maternal and paternal grandparents and other factions of the family. The state child welfare agency is almost always involved. There are several options for placing the child and you should speak with an attorney or social worker to do what is best for the child and your family.


Custody and legal placement. To keep the child out of the foster care system, the court will look to blood relatives first. If you are fit and have the resources to care for the child, the state will often take legal custody of the child and place her in your home. You handle all the day-to-day activities of a parent under the supervision of the court. This is always a temporary situation, usually lasting less than a year. Guardianship. This can be a good option for kinship placements. The court issues an order that gives you legal custody of the child and all legal rights to act as her parent. The difference between a guardianship and an adoption is that the rights of the birth parents are not severed. However, if the birth parents want to be involved in the child's life, they must go to court. In a guardianship, you may be eligible to receive child support payments from the birth parents. Adoption completely severs of the birth parents' legal rights to the child. As the kinship adopter, you become the child's parent in all facets of the law. You have the same rights and responsibilities of any other parent. , Generally, under the law, blood relatives have a special status in court cases involving the care and placement of minor children. These cases include when the child is in the custody of the state, when the child survives both of her parents and there is no guardianship in place, or in an adoption proceedings.


Federal law requires agencies to make reasonable efforts to keep siblings together in one home, offering services as needed to make the placement work. If there is a case involving a child who is your blood relative and you can show you have a relationship with the child, you can ask the court for ""interested party"" status. This means you have a right to receive documents and reports as well as notice of court hearings. Ten states have laws requiring agencies to give preference to blood relatives when evaluating adoption placements. In most states, if the parent purposely sent the child to live with relatives and consents to the adoption, the laws are set up to streamline the procedure. Typically, if the child has been living with the relative for some time, the home study will be cursory or waived all together. , Even though protecting your grandchild or niece may be the most important thing in your mind and heart, you also have to cope with the financial realities of raising a child. Most states offer some sort of assistance for adoptive parents. If the child has special needs, most states will offer support, access to services, and in some cases, financial stipends. As the adoptive parent, you will also be eligible to add the child to your employer health insurance or apply for insurance through the state. , A kinship adoption is often the most complicated of all adoption proceedings. In a stranger adoption, the parents' rights have been severed and custody transferred to the state before you are even considered. In a stepchild adoption, one of the birth parents is actively involved. However, in a kinship adoption, the issues with the birth parents may be unresolved, there may be resentment in the family, the state child welfare agency may have a custody interest, and the child may be ambivalent about being adopted. As a result, it is not recommended that you attempt to do a kinship adoption on your own as a pro se party.


If you have the financial resources, you can retain a family law attorney to act on your behalf.
Write a letter to the court hearing the child welfare case and ask if you qualify for court-appointed counsel.
Speak with your local Legal Aid office. There is a Legal Aid office for every county in the United States and, if you meet their income guidelines, you may qualify for representation. Contact the local bar association. Most bar associations have attorneys who are willing to assist with this type of case for a reduced fee or pro bono. , If the state is not involved, your attorney will file the adoption in the appropriate court on your behalf. A preliminary hearing will be scheduled to give the birth parents an opportunity to file a response to the petition.


If the birth parents both consent, they will sign notarized forms surrendering their parental rights.
At this stage, the family of the other parent may request the right to intervene or contest the adoption.

, If a state agency is involved, you will need their cooperation and approval for a kinship adoption. A supportive social worker can be your biggest asset.


The agency should have the documents needed for the adoption, such as certified birth certificates and parental death certificates. They also have access to records that can help locate absentee parents for service and consent.
Cooperate fully with requested home visits, interviews, and criminal background checks. Most states have laws in place to streamline these procedures and give preference to blood relatives, but your cooperation is essential. Be open and honest. After the state becomes involved, there is no ""private family business.""
Grandparents may be asked to submit to physical examinations to determine if they are healthy enough to be adoptive parents for young children.

, If you are looking to adopt a grandchild or the child of your sibling, talk with the family member birth parent about consenting to the adoption. You should also talk to the rest of the immediate family about their feelings. Forcing the court to sever parental rights can cause dissent in the family that is not good for the child.

, You may need to provide your own birth certificates, marriage and divorce documents, and employment records. Don't keep any secrets from your lawyer. If there is something in your past that may be an issue, such as a former drug problem, health issue, or criminal conviction, be honest about it before it becomes an issue in the adoption.


If your attorney is court-appointed, Legal Aid, or working pro bono, you will likely be able to get the court filing fees waived. Speak with your attorney about the records you will have to provide.
If there is a child welfare case, the state will handle the severance of the birth parents' rights. If the case goes to trial, you may be called to testify about anything you witnessed and about how you have been caring for the child. If you receive a subpoena or other notice from the state, contact your attorney immediately.

, Your attorney will give you notice and discuss what he believes may happen at the hearings. The first court date will be after all parties have been served and their time to respond has expired.


If the birth parents have consented or had their rights severed by the state, they are not required to attend.
If the family of the other birth parent or other family members want to object to the adoption or intervene, they may appear. Don't be hostile, no matter how angry or disappointed you may be. Direct all communication to your attorney.
Do not bring the children unless instructed to do so by your attorney. Some judges have rules against children in the courtroom and you cannot leave them unattended in the hallway. If you are working with the social welfare agency, they may have a playroom at their offices where the children can wait while you are in court.

, Most kinship adoptions are uncontested. The family understands, agrees, and cooperates to do what is best for the child. However, until the final order is issued, a trial is a possibility. A birth parent can rescind their consent or another family member can interfere. Your best bet is to comport yourself as if the case was going to go to trial.


Do not discuss the details of the case with the child. If you get questions that can't be answered with generalities, consider a family counseling session. Do not disrespect the birth parents to the child.
Do not discuss the details of the case with other family except in very general terms. If their input or cooperation is needed, let your attorney handle the communication.
Do not be hostile toward the family of the other birth parent. Even though rights have been surrendered or severed, they are the child's family as much as you are. The child may have significant affection for their other grandparents and aunts, uncles, and cousins. Discuss the issue with your attorney and social worker how to allow contact with the child, especially around the holidays.

, At this hearing, whether or not there was a trial, the court will review the documents and ask if you want to adopt the child. The state agency will likely attend and give their approval for the final adoption. If the children attend, the judge may talk to them.


The judge with either acknowledge that the birth parents consented or that there rights have been previously severed. If not, the judge will make a finding of fact that the parents are unfit and enter an order of severance.
Upon signing of the order, you become the child's legal parent.

, When you receive the file-stamped copy of the final adoption, you can file for a new birth certificate. Depending on your relationship to the child, for example you are the maternal grandparents, you may change the child's last name to match yours.

, Kinship adoptions are unique in that one or more of the birth parents may still be in the picture. It is up to you to decide how much, if any, contact you will allow between the birth parents and the child. Most kinship adoptions are successful and happy. However, depending on the family situation, you should be aware of the residual danger of a kinship adoption.


If the parents' rights were forcibly severed, there may be hostility and danger to the child. Update the family information with the child's school and caregivers. Inform them who can and can't pick the child up from school and who can access school records.
If the parents' rights were severed because of substance abuse or physical abuse, use your judgment in allowing contact. Protect the child like you would with anyone you felt might be a danger.
If a birth parent or other family becomes threatening, consider taking out a restraining order to protect you, your child, and your home.
If a birth parent or other family member leaves with the child or will not return the child after a visit, take the adoption papers and new birth certificate to law enforcement. This will help make them understand the situation and get them to help you retrieve the child.

Start your search with agencies near you, and make a list of several different agencies.Most adoption agencies have websites, so you can do much of this initial searching on the internet. You also can find tips and information on adoption community websites and online forums.
Look for agencies that have information specifically about single-parent adoption. Just because an agency doesn't have a policy against single-parent adoption doesn't necessarily mean they encourage or support single-parent adoption.;
, Many American mothers who've put their children up for adoption don't want them to go to single-parent homes. You'll typically have a lot better luck if you're interested in adopting a child from a developing country.If you want to adopt a baby, international adoption probably is your best bet as a single woman. Many American birth mothers putting infants up for adoption refuse to adopt to a single parent.

, Before you decide which agency you want to use, take the time visit the agency and talk to the people who work there about your desire to adopt as a single woman. If staff seem critical or resistant, that probably isn't the right agency for you.Most agencies have a welcome meeting that you can attend. They'll go over the adoption process and answer any questions you have. Ask if they've successfully placed children with single mothers, and what their policy is regarding single-parent adoptions.
You also may have the opportunity to talk to parents who have adopted children through that agency and learn more about their experiences.

, When you start the process of adopting a child as a single woman, you may not fully understand the demands and challenges of single parenting. Take your decision seriously and read as much as you can about coping strategies and tips from other single parents.A caseworker interviewing you for an agency may ask you questions based on how you anticipate handling any of these challenges. Researching ensures you at least have a general idea how to respond and don't appear completely unprepared.
You need to have a general idea of how you will handle various situations that might come up with your child. For example, if the school calls you and tells you that your child is sick, you need to know if you'll be free to leave work to pick up your child, or if you have a close friend or family member who could pick up your child for you.

, You may face resistance from adoption agencies and others who are concerned that as a single parent, you will be unable to adequately meet the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of a child on your own. It helps if you have a strong network of family and friends.For example, suppose your parents are retired and live near you. They may be willing to help take care of your child while you're at work.
Close friends and neighbors also can help take care of your child and provide support when you need it. Talk to everyone close to you and find out what they would be willing to do to help.

, You may be eligible for subsidies that can help cover some of your immediate adoption expenses. However, once the adoption is complete, you'll be on your own. Make sure you have the means to support a child for the next 10 to 20 years, depending on the age of the child you want to adopt.You don't have to be wealthy to adopt a child, but the more financially secure you are, the better your chances of being able to adopt as a single woman.
If you're carrying a lot of debt, it may be a good idea to pay some of that down before you think about adopting a child. That way you'll be on more stable financial footing when you begin the adoption process.

, If you have trouble finding an agency you like that will work with single parents, you might become a foster parent instead. Foster parents make a serious impact on a child's life, and you may have the opportunity to adopt a child you foster.Unlike adoption, you also are eligible to receive monthly payments to help financially support any foster children you care for.
Fostering children also can be a good way to demonstrate that you are capable of handling a child on your own. A strong foster care record makes you a strong candidate for adoption.

, State agencies, as well as a number of private agencies, typically have classes you must complete to learn about adoption and the needs of adoptive children.If you're adopting through a state agency, you may have to qualify as both a foster parent and an adoptive parent – even if you're not planning on fostering a child. When adopting through a private agency, you may have to pay a fee to attend parenting classes.
During the training sessions, you'll go through the adoption application. If you have any questions about the process or any of the items on the application, ask a staff member for clarification.

, You must provide thorough personal and financial information to adopt a child. You'll need to attach documentation to your application that supports the statements you made in the application itself.You'll have to verify your employment and income, and the adoption agency may contact your employer.
You also must provide identification that proves you meet the minimum age for adoptive parents in your state.
Ask your employer, family members, or other colleagues or community members to write reference letters for you to support your application to adopt.

, Adoption agencies require you to submit an application, either in person or online, along with all required documents and letters of reference. Before you submit your application, double-check and make sure you have answered all questions honestly and completely.If you have any issues that you think might negatively impact the agency's decision, you might want to write a statement explaining the situation and how you've changed. For example, if you've ever been arrested or convicted of a crime, you want to address this up front on your application and discuss it openly.

, Once your application is accepted by the agency, you'll be assigned a caseworker who will be your point person throughout the adoption process. They will describe to you the next steps of the process.You need to maintain a good relationship with your caseworker. They are on your side, and want to help you adopt a child. They can answer any questions you have, as well as give you tips and advice.

, In most states, you must pass a criminal and employment background check before you will be finally approved to adopt. Typically you must request your criminal history from the FBI and the state law enforcement agencies of any states where you've lived.You also must show that you've never been listed on any child abuse, domestic violence, or sex offender registries.
If you have friends or family members who either live in your home or will be frequent visitors, they also may be required to submit criminal histories.

, Either your caseworker or another evaluator typically will conduct a home study to evaluate the home environment you plan to provide for the child you adopt.Since the home study is more in-depth than the application, you'll need additional documents that provide information about your home life and personal history. Pull any legal documents, such as diplomas, divorce decrees, or birth certificates, that relate to significant events in your life.
You also may need to get a physical exam and submit a health report as part of your home study. Generally, they want to make sure you don't have any serious health problems that could negatively affect your ability to raise a child.

, As part of your home study, your caseworker will interview both you and any friends or family members. They will visit and inspect your home and the space you have available for a child. The main purpose of the home study is to make sure you're adequately prepared to be a parent.Your caseworker should let you know if they find anything that might cause your application to be rejected, and give you advice on what to do with it. Through the home study, your caseworker is trying to help you get approved – not looking for reasons to reject you.
If you went with a private agency, you typically must pay additional fees for the home study. These fees range anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars. Your caseworker will explain the fees and payment options available.

, Once your home study is complete, your case worker will create a written report of your home study. Typically you'll have a meeting where they will go over the report with you and answer any questions you have.The home study report typically must be approved by someone else in the agency. They typically will follow your case worker's recommendation.
If there are any aspects of your home study that your case worker thinks might cause you to be rejected as an adoptive parent, they will talk to you about those issues. There may be things you can do to eliminate or lessen those issues.

, Provided you're approved as an adoptive parent after your home study is completed, your caseworker will start giving you information about children who are available for adoption.Your case worker will talk to you about your preferences for adoption, such as your age or gender preferences. They also will look at information about your lifestyle to help find the best possible matches for you.
Talk to your case worker about activities you enjoy or other hobbies, particularly if you're thinking about adopting an older child. The case worker can be on the lookout for children who enjoy those activities as well.

Generally, you will submit one original petition for the court and one copy to be stamped by the court for your personal records.If the adoptee is developmentally disabled, there may be additional steps that you must take before attending an adoption hearing. For example, in California a 30-day notice prior to the hearing must be given to the director of the regional center for the developmentally disabled.
You can check your state laws or ask the court clerk whether there are any additional steps you must take to protect the rights of a developmentally disabled adoptee., Once all of your supporting documentation has been submitted and the court reviews the materials, a hearing date will be set.

, The court will send a notice of the adoption to the state’s office of vital records documenting the change in legal parentage. You may receive a notice from the vital records office asking whether you want to amend your birth certificate in order to reflect the adoption. Once processed, an adoptee can request a copy of his or her new birth certificate., Adult adoptions are more likely to be granted by the court if the relationship between the adopter and adoptee has lasted for many years. For example, a mentor/mentee relationship of 10 years may be a good candidate for adult adoption if both parties meet other prerequisites., Many states require that the adopter be older than the adoptee. If this is not the case, a court may reject the adoption petition., Prior to the Supreme Court ruling that found prohibitions on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, some same-sex couples attempted to use adult adoption as a way to secure rights for their partner. Before marriage equality, this was the only way for some couples to ensure that their same-sex partner inherited their estate or were allowed visitation rights at the hospital.


Some courts rejected these attempts to use adoption as a way to give rights to a same-sex couples.
Some courts rejected these attempts because they stated that adoption was designed to formalize a parent-child relationship., Many states require both parties to the adoption to be residents in the same state. If a party fails to meet this requirement in a state that has a residency rule, the adoption petition may be denied."

While your situation will undoubtedly be unique, you should consider an adult adoption if you:Were the foster parent of the adult while he or she was growing up. The child might not have wanted to be adopted earlier in life so he or she could receive foster care benefits (e.g., medical and financial).
Want some legal recognition and formalization of a longstanding parent-child relationship.
Want to provide inheritance rights to the adult.
Want the adult to have a parent who can act as a medical contact and/or make medical decisions.
Feel as though the adult needs (or wants) support throughout life (e.g., birthdays, anniversaries, births).;
, Adopting an adult in North Carolina requires that you file a petition with your local court and attend a formal hearing. While the process is relatively straightforward, the use of a lawyer can help you understand the legal ramifications of going through with the adoption (e.g., inheritance rights, diminished rights of your spouse). In addition, a lawyer will help you fill out your forms accurately and completely. Failure to do this may result in your adoption being delayed.


If you do not want to hire a lawyer for the entire adoption process, consider consulting one to get an idea of the process and requirements. A lot of lawyers will offer free consultations where you may be able to get the information you need.
If you do not know where to Find a Good Family Law Attorney, contact the North Carolina State Bar Lawyer Referral Service. After answering a few questions about your legal issue, you will be put in contact with various family law lawyers in your area., North Carolina, by statute, allows for the adoption of adults. The only time an adult cannot be adopted is if that adult is your spouse. When you petition to adopt an adult, that adult, as well as other interested parties, must consent to the adoption.Finally, either you or the adoptee (i.e., the person you are adopting) must have lived in North Carolina for six consecutive months preceding the adoption petition., If you meet the requirements necessary to adopt an adult, visit your local courthouse and obtain an adult adoption packet. Most courts will put together a set of forms, which you can use to petition the court, get consent, and finalize the adoption. Even if there is not an entire packet available, court employees should be able to point you in the right direction.While some states will conduct adoption proceedings in special courts, North Carolina conducts adult adoptions in the General Court of Justice, District Court Division., Your adoption petition should be filled out on Form DSS-5163. The petition is the court document that starts the legal proceedings and informs the court of your intentions. The petition will always start with a caption, which identifies the county you are filing in and the petitioner(s) name(s). You are the petitioner, along with your spouse if applicable, because you are the one asking for the adoption. In addition to the caption, your petition must also contain the following information:The full name of the adoptee
Your name and address
A promise that you or the adoptee have lived in North Carolina for six consecutive months immediately preceding the petition
Where and when the adoptee was born
Whether you are related to the adoptee
The names, ages, and addresses of any adult children you have
The names, ages, and addresses of any adult children, parents, and spouses the adoptee has

It must also contain a statement indicating that the adoptee understand that he or she may be losing, or gaining, certain inheritance rights from certain individuals.A consent Form (Form DSS-5164) is available for you to give to the adoptee., If you are the adoptee's stepparent, and you are still married to your spouse, that spouse must also consent to the adoption.

The guardian must indicate that he or she understands the adoption will affect the rights of the adoptee, that the adoption is in the best interest of the adoptee, and that the adoption will not terminate the guardian's rights, duties, or obligations.There is no consent form for the guardian. If you need the guardian to consent, inform them of the requirements and let them return a customized consent form to you.

, Your county may require you to attach the adoptee's certified birth certificate to the rest of your court paperwork. If the adoptee is from another country, the original birth certificate must be attached along with a translation. In addition, some courts may require you to provide a written statement telling the court why you want to adopt the adult. If you are not required to do this in writing, you will have to do this verbally during your court hearing., When all of your paperwork has been filled out, take everything to the clerk of court.This court employee will file your paperwork and start the adoption process. When you file, you will be required to give the clerk your original copies of everything. Therefore, it is important you make multiple copies of everything for your records. When you successfully file your paperwork, it will be stamped as ""filed"" and your copies will be returned to you.


The courthouse you file with will be the courthouse in the county where you reside. Make sure you file with the correct court or your adoption may be delayed.

, At the same time you file your paperwork, you will also have to pay a filing fee. The filing fee will vary from county to county but generally falls somewhere between $100 and $400. If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you may ask the court for a fee waiver. The court will grant your waiver if you can prove you do not have the financial ability to make the required payment.

, Within 30 days of filing your adoption petition, you must serve notice of your filing on certain persons. In an adult adoption, you must notify:Any person who is required to give consent
Your spouse
Your adult children
The adoptee's adult children

, When you serve people, hire someone over the age of 18 who is unrelated to the case. He or she will mail or hand deliver copies of your court filings to each individual. Once service has been completed, the server will fill out a proof of service form promising that service was completed legally.


These proof of service forms must be filed with the court., If the adult adoptee is incompetent, the court will appoint a guardian ad litem (GAL), which is a court employee responsible for taking the adoptee's best interests into consideration.The GAL will conduct an investigation into the adoption and report his or her findings to the court. During the investigation, the GAL may visit you, inspect your home, inspect your financial information, and may conduct interviews with friends and family.


Help the GAL in any way you can to ensure a positive report is made. While not dispositive, a negative report can affect your ability to finalize the adoption.

, At least 10 days before the final adoption decree is signed, you must provide the court with details about payments you made in connection with the adoption. You can do this by filling out Form DSS-5191, signing it, and filing it with the court before your hearing.


Form DSS-5191 will ask you to include the amount of each payment, the recipient of each payment, and a description of each payment., On the day of your adoption hearing, arrive to the courthouse early. Give yourself enough time to find parking, get through security, and settle into the courtroom. The adoptee and any interested parties will also attend the hearing. When your case is called, go to the front of the courtroom and wait for the proceedings to start. The judge will need to know the following information in order to grant your adoption petition:All interested parties are at the hearing and have an opportunity to speak
The adoptee is over the age of 18 and the proper consent has been given
All other required consents have been obtained
At least 30 days have elapsed since you filed your petition for adoption
The adoption is being entered into freely without duress or undue influence
One or both current parents understand that parental rights will be terminated

, After the hearing concludes, the judge will decide whether to grant the adult adoption. If the judge grants the adoption, he or she will need to sign an adoption decree, which makes the judge's ruling final.


Before the hearing starts, obtain a copy of Form DSS-5166, which is an adoption decree. Fill in the blanks and take the original copy to your hearing.When the hearing concludes, hand the decree to the judge. He or she will sign the bottom of it. The clerk of court will make copies for your records.

, Soon after your hearing, when the judge signs the adoption decree, he or she will also sign a vital records request. This request asks the state to make a new, and updated, version of the adoptee's birth certificate. Fill out Form DSS-5167 and submit it with the adoption decree.


Form DSS-5167 asks you to provide the court with the adoptee's name, as you would like it to be on the new birth certificate. In addition, you will be able to provide your personal information, which will also be placed on the new birth certificate., If your adoption petition is unopposed and you get the consent of every necessary party, the adoption process will go smoothly. If this is the case, the court will grant the adoption so long as it is found to be in the best interest of the adult adoptee and you meet all the requirements of an adoption (e.g., filling out the petition and completing all other paperwork).


However, in some circumstances, someone might oppose the adoption. This will be rare in adult adoptions because the only parties that need to consent are the adult adoptee and your spouse (if applicable).
If the adult adoptee opposes the adoption, you will have no chance of getting it granted.
If your spouse opposes the adoption, your hearing will be contentious. You will have to convince the judge that, despite your spouse's opposition, the adoption should be granted. The judge will only grant the adoption if he or she can find cause to waive the consent requirement.In most cases, this occurs when spouses are separated or estranged.

Because the adoption is an international coordination, there are certain conditions that must be met in order for the process to be approved.


The adopting parents must typically live in Japan throughout the entire court process. This requires a minimum stay of six months, but the court process may take up to 18 months. At least one parent must be in attendance at the court when the case is finalized.Typically, the adopting parents must be a married couple. Exceptions are sometimes made for single parents on a case-by-case basis. Same-sex couples may be eligible for adopting from Japan, provided that the couple's home state recognizes the marriage as a legal union.The adopting parents will have to provide some proof of income and financial savings to prove that they can provide for the child.In a specialized adoption, which allows the parents to secure a US visa for the child, both of the adopting parents must be at least 20 years of age, with at least one parent over 25 years of age.;
, The first step in beginning the adoption process is to choose an accredited/approved adoption service provider from the country you will be adopting from (in this case Japan). The adoption service provider is a specialized adoption agency or individual, typically with a background in family counseling or social work.The adoption service provider serves as the primary provider for your adoption case.The most common primary providers in Japan include the Japanese Family Court, the Child Guidance Center, and private parties like missionaries, social welfare groups, or adoption services.When comparing primary providers, look at each provider's number of annual adoption placements over the past three years and the percentage of those placements that remained intact. This information is available upon request from each provider and will give you a good idea of how successful each provider has been in recent years.You should also ask each provider how many adoption-eligible children they represent., Once you've selected an adoption service you'll need to fill out Form I-600A, the Application for Advance Processing of Orphan Petition with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. This form is used by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to evaluate your qualifications as a parent and make a formal judgment on whether or not you qualify for an international adoption.Form I-600A must be completed before the actual adoption process begins. Even if you have already identified a child to adopt from Japan, the child must remain in Japan while Form I-600A is filed in the United States.If your application is approved by the USCIS, you will receive a written notification through the mail. Your approval is valid for 18 months. If the adoption has not been completed in that time period, you will have to begin the application process from the beginning.Because Japan is a non-Hague Convention country, you do not need to fill out Form I-800A, the Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country., The USCIS conducts FBI background checks on all prospective adoptive parents. These checks are performed using fingerprinting records. Successful fingerprint and background checks are only valid for 15 months, so it's important to begin the adoption process as soon as possible.


The USCIS charges $80 per person at the time of filing for fingerprint and background checks. This must be completed at an authorized location, including USCIS offices, US Application Support Centers, and US embassies and military offices abroad., A home study consists of an in-person interview and other procedures designed to review the fitness of you and your home environment. The individual who conducts the study will evaluate your physical, mental, and financial capabilities, as well as your current living conditions., You will also need to send in a filing fee of $720, plus an additional $85 fee for every individual living in your household over the age of 18., Japanese adoption law requires that at least one prospective parent be physically present in Japan to initiate proceedings. Adoption by proxy is not allowed., An attorney is not mandatory, but may be useful in navigating Japanese adoption law. The Family Court in Japan finalizes all adoption cases, and certain paperwork must be filed with the clerk's office. Having an attorney who is fluent in Japanese and well-versed in Japanese law would be an invaluable aid during this process., In addition to meeting the guidelines for adopting a child in the United States, prospective parents wishing to complete a special adoption must also meet Japan's guidelines for adoption. The child must also meet certain guidelines to be adopted internationally.The prospective child must be under the age of 6 before the petition is filed or below the age of 8 if the child has been under the care of the prospective parents since before the child reached age 6.The child must reside with the prospective adoptive parents for 6 months before the Family Court will issue an adoption decree., Prospective parents must have numerous documents signed, notified, or otherwise authenticated. These documents include:


birth certificatespassportsJapanese visasmarriage certificatescertificate of no criminal record (obtained from each parent's home city or state police department in the United States)certificate of legal address, employment, and bank statementscopy of property ownership deeds (if applicable)biographic histories of both parentsstatement of consent to adopt by the child's current guardianstatement of prospective parents' intent to adopthome study approved by a licensed adoption agencytwo character references, Some adoptable children in Japan do not qualify as orphans by the definition used in the US, and only children who qualify as orphans by that definition can receive an immigrant visa. In order to qualify as an orphan a child must have lost both parents, generally through death or abandonment. The child of a single parent is rarely labeled as an orphan, but an exception might be made if the parent cannot care for the child and surrenders custody., Form I-604, the Report on Overseas Orphan Investigation, is used to verify the child's orphan status. Even though the I-600 can be completed before you have a child in mind for adoption, the I-604 must be completed only after you have a specific child in mind. This investigation will be performed by a consular office during the child's interview for an immigrant visa, and may take upwards of several months to complete., Since your child is not yet a U.S. citizen, he or she will need a Japanese passport to come back with you to the United States. Contact Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US Embassy in Tokyo to obtain the necessary paperwork.


You will need to apply for and secure a new birth certificate for the child that includes your name. You will also need to apply for a family registry for the child. Both of these documents will be needed to secure a passport. Your adoption service provider can assist you during this process.Once you have the child's birth certificate and family registry, you'll need to secure a travel document or passport from Japan.You will also need to apply for a US immigrant visa for the child. This can be acquired through the US Embassy in Tokyo. Prior to the immigrant visa interview, you should submit an Electronic Immigrant Visa Application (Form DS-260), which can be found online at the Consular Electronic Application Center.Bring a printed-out copy of the DS-260 form completion page to the visa interview., If the adoption has been approved and finalized before returning to the United States, the child will automatically earn US citizenship, provided that the child meets the requirements of the Child Citizenship Act of 2000.The child's requirements for citizenship include:


being under 18 years of agegaining legal admission as an immigrant for lawful permanent residencehaving at least one adoptive parent who is an American citizen, either by birth or naturalizationliving in the legal and physical custody of the parent who is a lawful American citizen"

To use whole wheat bread when making any sort of snack.
To look for whole grain cereals free from added sugar (or with very little added sugar)., Snacks that include dairy are important because they contain calcium, iron, and other important vitamins. Thus, you need to make sure you include dairy products in your snack plan.


Your child should have three servings of dairy a day. When it comes to processed cheese, this equates to 1 slice, 1 mini string cheese, and 1 mini baby bell. Feel free to include these in your toddler’s snacks.
One small pot (about 125 ml) of yogurt makes for a great snack. At the same time, you can serve half of a small pot of yogurt with fruit or vegetables.
Consider providing your child with a 3 or 4 ounce cup (100 to 120 ml) of milk with their snack. Use semi skimmed milk for toddlers over 2 years old. Those under 2 years old should be served 3 ounces (100 ml) or less of whole milk., Like dairy, meat is an important source of iron and other vitamins that toddlers need. As a result, make sure to include meat in their snack rotation. However, you should also limit the amount of meat and type of meat your toddler consumes.


Focus on lean meats like fish, good cuts of beef or pork, or chicken and turkey.
Avoid processed meat, if you can. This includes many types of lunch meats like salami, bologna, some types of ham, and pepperoni. When shopping for lunch or deli meat, look for meats that do not include nitrates or nitrites.
The total amount of meat a 2-year-old should consume per day is 2 ounces. Toddlers that are three years old can eat 3 to 4 ounces (85 to 113 grams) of meat. Make sure you account for your toddler’s daily consumption when serving them meat for snacks.
Provide ½ to 1 egg (poached, boiled, or fried) as an alternative to meat., Despite the claims of some fruit juice makers, drinking a lot of fruit juice can hurt a toddler’s health. Ultimately, fruit juice contains a lot of sugar, and should be limited.


Avoid juices with added sugar.
Juices advertised as 100% fruit juice still have a lot of sugar – often equal to the sugar and/or calories contained in a soda.
Toddlers should drink no more than 4 ounces (120 millimeters) of fruit juice per day., Snacks with added sugar are one of the worst things you can give your toddler. Not only are they unhealthy, but they help establish bad eating habits. If your toddler gets used to eating foods with added sugar, they’ll continue that habit into adulthood.


Avoid cereals with added sugar, like Frosted Flakes.
Snacks high in sugar could aggravate conditions like juvenile diabetes.
It is okay for your toddler to have things like birthday cake, ice cream, or similar snacks as a treat. However, don’t establish it as a habit., Not only are these foods unhealthy over the long run, but they can cause digestive problems like diarrhea. Avoid:


Fried food. For example, mini corn dogs are not a good snack for your toddler.
An excessive amount of cheese.
Fatty cuts of meat. Limit consumption of sausages and some cuts of beef or pork., By combining two simple things together, you’ll create a tasty snack that your toddler might get really excited about. When preparing the snack:


Use peanut butter with no added oils. Natural peanut butter will only contain peanuts and salt.
Serve a quarter to a third of a small apple to your toddler along with a quarter or half of a tablespoon of peanut butter – the amount varies with age.
Make sure you slice the apple thinly, so your toddler can eat it easily.
If food allergies run in your family, consult your pediatrician before serving peanut butter to a toddler for the first time., Whether a toddler or an adult, many people enjoy the combination of cottage cheese and peaches. In the end, this is a simple, healthy, and delicious snack that your toddler may love.


Set aside no more than a quarter cup of canned peaches. Make sure the peaches have been canned in their own juices.
Add no more than 1 or 2 tablespoons of cottage cheese on top of the peaches., Cucumbers and hummus are a healthy combination that your toddler may get excited about. When eating cucumbers and hummus, your toddler will not only get vitamins from the cucumber, but protein from the hummus.


Thinly slice 1/4th of a medium cucumber and place them on a plate.
Portion out 1 or 2 tablespoons of hummus next to the cucumber.
Consider substituting hummus for low fat salad dressing.
Think about substituting cucumbers for red peppers or a similar vegetable."

The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services oversees the Statewide Adoption and Permanency Network (SWAN), which includes county children and youth agencies, private adoption agencies, and others working to find permanent homes for children in Pennsylvania.You can use SWAN to find an agency to use to adopt a child. SWAN also offers support groups and other resources after you've finalized the adoption.;
, Most agencies will require you to attend an orientation before you apply to adopt a child.


The orientation session will provide basic information about the application and adoption process.
The agency will charge you a fee for adoption, which varies among agencies. The fee is paid by the state if you are adopting a child with at least moderate challenges, a child over the age of 10, or a sibling group of children. If you do have to pay fees up front, a portion of those fees may be refunded after the child is placed in your home., Typically the application asks for information about your family composition, background, and criminal record.


As part of the application, you must disclose information about your education, employment, and finances as well as personal references and a doctor's statement certifying your basic health.When you complete the application, the agency will conduct an initial screening and background check. If any member of your household has been named as a child abuse perpetrator, convicted of a drug- or alcohol-related felony within the past five years, or been convicted of certain sexual or violent crimes, the agency will reject your application.Not only must prospective parents complete background checks, but also anyone living in the household who is over 18 years of age. These background checks include state and federal criminal background checks, certification from the statewide child abuse registry, and a full set of fingerprints., The adoption professional will ask you questions and compile your family profile based on your responses to those questions.


Your family profile will be used to match you with the child that would best fit into your family. The agency worker will ask questions about why you want to adopt, your previous experiences with children, and your background and life experiences.The home study also provides an opportunity for you to ask questions and prepare yourself for the adoption process. For example, you might want to learn what challenges are involved in caring for a child with special needs, or find out what kind of resources are available to assist you.At least one of the meetings must occur in your home. The agency worker will assess your home and conduct a safety check of your home and the resources and room you have available for a child.The social worker identifies your strengths as a parent and matches those strengths to the needs of a particular child who is waiting to be adopted.The pre-adoptive home study and pre-placement report must be completed within three years of the date the child is placed in your home, and must have been updated within a year of the date the child is placed in your home., Pennsylvania requires adoptive parents to complete parental preparation training before they can adopt a child.The state recommends completing at least 24 hours, although the specific number of hours may differ depending on the agency you choose to assist you in finding a child., The PAE routinely reviews family profiles and alerts agencies when a possible match is found.


If a possible agency is found, your social worker will contact you and provide information about the child, his family background, intellectual ability, age, and any special needs or concerns the child may have., When a county agency makes a tentative match, it will schedule a meeting so you can spend time with the child.


An adoption worker will observe your interactions with the child and see how you work together.
The worker may talk to you and to the child separately before making a decision whether the suggested match is best both for the child and for your family.

, If the tentative match is approved by the agency, the child can move into your home with you.

, In the first six months or so the child lives with you, an adoption worker will make regular visits to evaluate the relationship and offer any necessary assistance.


The supervised period lasts from three to six months. If you are a foster parent and have already had the child placed in your home as a foster child prior to adoption, you may have a shorter supervised period. However, the child must live in your home for at least six months total before the adoption can be finalized., If the agency offers any free parenting or adoption programs, you should take advantage of these resources.


You also may be able to find support groups and other resources either through your agency or on SWAN., If your placement continues to be positive after the first six months or so, you may petition the court to make the adoption final.You must file a ""Report of Intent to Adopt"" with the court at the point the child is placed with you for adoption. You might consider hiring an attorney to help you fill out and file this form so you don't make any mistakes.Your report must be filed with the Orphans' Court in your county within 30 days of the day the child is placed with you. The report includes information about you, your family, the child, and the agency arranging for the placement., Before the court can finalize the adoption, it must make sure the child is legally free to be adopted and that the agency with custody consents to the adoption.Within six months of the date that you filed your Report of Intent to Adopt, the social worker or other staff member of your adoption agency must file a Report of the Intermediary, which includes information about the child, you, and the social worker's interactions and observations with the child placed in your home.You also must negotiate with your adoption agency and file the resulting Adoption Subsidy Agreement. This agreement specifies ongoing financial and educational support for the child, including any reimbursement of adoption fees or other expenses related to the adoption process., After you've completed all legal obligations, you may file a petition and request a hearing to finalize the adoption decision., At the final hearing, the judge will review information about the child's placement and approve the adoption.The court holds hearings regarding the termination of birth parents' rights, then schedules a final hearing to review the Petition for Adoption.When you attend your hearing, you must present to the court a positive home study as well as copies of your fingerprints and criminal record histories."

Contact an adoption agency.,
Consider whether or not you can travel to Korea.,
Make yourself aware of the age and civil status guidelines set by Korean authorities.,
Prepare the necessary documents.",How to Adopt a Korean Baby2," Korea's special adoption law No. 2977 section 9 (A) requires the use of such agencies for international adoptions, and section 10 (A) specifies that all such agencies must be officially recognized by Korea's Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. This agency is the government authority that oversees adoptions in the Republic of Korea.


The four primary Korean agencies are Eastern Social Welfare Society, Social Welfare Society, Holt Children Services, and Korea Social Services.
Look for agencies based in the United States that specialize in Korean adoptions. Before settling on an agency, check the Better Business Bureau for its record. Legitimate adoption agencies are affiliated with government licensed agencies located in Korea.

, Korean adoption laws do not require that prospective parents travel to Korea to adopt. Typically, the child being adopted is sent to the United States in the care of a U.S. adoption agency that is licensed to work with the Korean agency you adopted the child from. Note that some U.S. adoption agencies have their own requirements on travel and may request or demand that one or both parents travel to Korea before bringing their new child back home.


The U.S. Embassy in Seoul suggests that prospective parents wait until after the U.S. issues the immigrant visa for their potential adoptive child. Potential delays could otherwise force parents to remain in the country longer than anticipated.

, These guidelines are not strict legal requirements, but Korean adoption agencies consistently adhere to them nonetheless. If you do not fulfill one or more of these guidelines, you should talk to your adoption agency about the possibility of having an exception made for your circumstances.


Two married individuals must be willing to adopt, and their marriage must have lasted for three years or more. Single parent adoptions are not permitted.
Prospective parents must be between the ages of 25 and 44. Exceptions may be made if only one parent is under age 45, if both parents have adopted a Korean orphan in the past, or if the parents are willing to adopt a Korean child with serious medical ailments.
The age difference between the prospective mother and father should be no greater than 15 years.
The prospective family should have no more than five children, including the baby they wish to adopt.
Prospective parents should have a combined income above the national U.S. average. At minimum, the family income must be at least $25,000/year.

, All documents must be authenticated before Korean authorities will accept them.


U.S. civil records, including birth and marriage certificates, must be marked with a seal from the issuing office and authenticated by the Secretary of State located in your state's capital, as well as the U.S. Department of State Authentication. The documents must then be authenticated by the Korean Embassy or Consulate in the United States.
Other documents, like tax returns and medical reports, must be notarized and authenticated by the county clerk. The documents then head over to the Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State Authentication’s Office, and the Korean Embassy or Consulate.

Verify that your prospective adoptive child qualifies as an orphan under section 101(b)(1)(F) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act.,
Fill out Form I-604, Report on Overseas Orphan Investigation, and file it with the USCIS.,
Prepare for follow-up visits.",How to Adopt a Korean Baby3," Unless the child is a previously adopted child who has legally resided with you for two years or more, your new baby must be an orphan in order to apply for an immigrant visa.


Typically, an orphan is a child who has lost both parents. Both parents may have died, or they may have abandoned the child. Children in single-parent households are rarely labeled as orphans, but an exception may be made if the parent cannot care for the child and turns custody of him or her over without demanding any rights later on., Form I-604 must be completed after you have a specific child in mind, and the investigation officially determines whether or not the prospective adoptive child presently has legal orphan status.

, Once the baby arrives home, the U.S. adoption agency will perform several home visits spaced six months apart. The U.S. agency then sends a report back to the South Korean agency, which holds the reports permanently. A Korean baby is not officially adopted until after he or she resides with the adoptive parents for one year, and these follow-up visits usually last until the child becomes a naturalized citizen.

Ultimately, pre-adoption counseling may be useful to prospective adoptive parents, and some adoption authorities may ask what—if any—counseling you have gotten., Counseling during the adoption process can also be useful for prospective adoptive parents. The process can be difficult, and you may want some support along the way. Consider finding counseling services that can help you during the process., Post-adoption counseling can be very helpful with transitioning your family after the adoption has been completed.

The living conditions will be evaluated in addition to the mental, physical, and emotional states of the prospective adoptive parents (and any other adult members of the household).Your ability to care for a child with special needs will be evaluated if applicable.
The home study may also assess how many children you may adopt or place restrictions on what children you may adopt (if you cannot accommodate a child with special needs, for instance).
The provider will also want to know what counseling (if any) you have gotten regarding your adoption and/or what counseling you will get post-placement.

, You may be asked to give information about debt, income, and expenses—including those related to caring for other members of your family. Be sure to be as thorough as possible in giving information to the provider in order to facilitate the process of the adoption as easily as possible., The provider will complete a criminal background check in order to ensure your have not been cited for child abuse, etc. You may also be evaluated for drug abuse, sexual abuse, or domestic violence, particularly within the relationships of the adults in your household.You must disclose any criminal history or you may have your application denied.

, If you have ever had an application rejected for any reason, you will need to explain this to the provider. This is especially the case if you were rejected because of an unfavorable evaluation of an adult member of your household., You must file the application with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The application must be submitted at the same time as the home study and there will be an application fee of $720 plus an $85 fee for fingerprinting of each adult member of your household. Since India is a party to the Hague Adoption Convention, you will need to file the form for a Convention country, which is Form I-800A.Supporting documentation may include proof of citizenship as well as a copy of your marriage certificate.
India does not allow same-sex couples to adopt Indian children.
File your application first, and do not contact parents, guardians, or anyone else who may be responsible for a child who is up for adoption.

Use these as a jumping-off point to learn more about each agency and its adoption process.The process for private agencies may be a bit more involved than if you go through a state agency, and also may cost a little more money. In exchange, you may have more control over the adoption process or more guidance and assistance after the adoption is complete.
State adoption services can be a good source of information about the legal and financial assistance available to adoptive parents.;
, While there are plenty of American children looking for forever homes, you may also adopt a child of another race directly from their home country. Look for an agency headquartered in the United States if you want to explore international adoption.Agencies headquartered in another country could be a scam, and you may not have the ability to adequately research their background and reputation.
Check adoption alert notifications on the State Department's website regularly. These will let you know if there are any problems with adoptions in specific countries., Once you have a list of three or four different potential adoption agencies, make appointments to visit each of them and talk to the people who work there. Then you can compare to choose the best agency for you.Get an understanding of costs up front, but don't base your decision solely on the amount of money it will cost to complete your adoption. You want to choose an agency where you feel comfortable and at home.
Since you want to adopt a child of another race, find out if any of the agencies offer cultural or language support, or if they have classes or other resources available for transracial families.

, Most agencies have prospective adoptive parents attend an orientation session or an introductory class so you can learn more about the adoption process and the policies of that particular agency.Pre-service training is required in most states, whether you are using a public or private adoption agency.
Focus on the presentation, and make note of any questions you have so you can ask agency staff later.

, While you certainly don't have to be wealthy to adopt a child, you will have to be able to demonstrate that you have the space to house the child and the financial means to support the child.Home and community environment are also important. Talk to your family and friends, and evaluate the multicultural resources available in your area. Make sure those close to you accept your decision to adopt a child of another race.
You also want to make sure there are no legal restrictions that would prevent you from adopting a child. If you're thinking about adopting internationally, you want to look at the laws in the child's home country as well.

, Take a look at your adoption application and make a list of the documents you'll need to provide to back up the statements you make on your application. Typically these are personal and financial documents.You'll need proof of employment and income, as well as proof of your identity, citizenship, and place of residence.
Depending on the agency, you also may be required to submit copies of other documents, such as university diplomas or professional licenses.

, Take your completed application and copies of any documents together to the adoption agency. There may be an application fee you have to pay when you submit your initial application.Based on this application, the agency will decide whether to proceed and open a case for you. At this stage, the agency really is only looking to make sure you meet the basic minimum legal requirements to adopt a child.
Typically if you are living with a spouse, both of you must sign the application to adopt the child.

, When the agency accepts your initial application, you'll be assigned a caseworker. Your caseworker works with you to get you approved as adoptive parents and helps match you with potential children.During your first meeting with your caseworker, they will explain the adoption process more in-depth, giving you a basic timeline for each of the phases of the process.
The caseworker also will ask you questions about the information on your application, as well as follow up questions, in an effort to get to know you as potential parents.

, Most states require criminal and employment background checks for adoptive parents, whether you're adopting through a public or private agency. The same background checks are required for all adults living in your home, or who would have frequent contact with the adopted child.You will need an FBI federal criminal background check, as well as criminal history reports from the state law enforcement agency of any state where you've lived.
You also typically must show that you've never been required to register for child abuse or domestic violence, or as a sex offender.

, The final step in the application process to adopt a child is the home study. Your caseworker will visit your home and interview you and other members of your family. They'll also review your personal, legal, and financial records.In some cases you must provide a physical health report. You can still adopt if you have a disability or health condition. The agency primarily wants to make sure that you don't have any conditions that would seriously shorten your life expectancy.
Answer your caseworker's questions as honestly as possible, even if you think the answer might negatively impact the caseworker's opinion of you. The caseworker is on your side – if you're honest with them about any issues you might have, they can help you find ways to handle those issues.

, When your caseworker completes your home study, they'll compile a report. If they recommend you for adoption, they may start looking for potential children for you right away.Work with your caseworker to learn the types of children who are typically available. Based on this information, you may want to adjust your preferences.
You may have a longer wait before you are matched with a child depending on your preferences. For example, you may have to wait several years before an infant is available, whereas if you were willing to adopt a school-age child you could have found a placement within a few weeks.

, When your adopted child is a different race than you are, help them understand the concept of race and how they may have different racial or ethnic traditions than you do.As you teach your child, learn about these customs and traditions yourself. If you've adopted a child from abroad, learn as much as you can about the history and culture of the country where your child was born.
If your child comes from a country or culture that speaks a language other than English, you might consider learning the language yourself and helping your child learn.

, Making your adopted child a part of your family means making that child's ethnic holidays and cultural traditions a part of your family life as well. Strive to include more than just a holiday or two once a year.For holidays that are celebrated in the child's birth culture as well as your own, incorporate some of the other cultural traditions into your celebration.
Invite friends and family to participate in the child's birth culture and learn about the child's cultural background and ethnic traditions.

, If you adopt a child from another race, they'll feel more welcome and part of the family if they see examples of other interracial families as well. If you treat interracial families as normal, the child won't grow up thinking there's very much different about their family or your relationship.Depending on where you live, you may be able to join a community group or organization committed to diversity and interracial families.
You also should include families in your life who are the same race or ethnicity as your adopted child. These families will allow your child to interact with people who look like them and potentially understand more about their birth culture.

, If you can afford to do so, your best option if you want to adopt a child of another race is to move to an area that is racially diverse. That way your adopted child won't be the only child of their race in school.Having a racially diverse community gives your child the opportunity not only to socialize with other children of their own race, but also to get to know a variety of children from various races and ethnic backgrounds.
Especially if you had an international adoption, you also might consider living in or near an area that is an enclave for immigrants from the same country as your child. For example, if you adopted a child from China, you might want to move into or near your city's ""Chinatown"" or ""Little China"" neighborhood.

, Various cultural pride groups often have public events centered around cultural holidays and traditions. Taking your child to these events allows them to experience a slice of their culture.Try to return to the same events every year so your child can develop habits around those events and get to know the people who organize and attend those events in your city or town.
If there aren't any such events near you, search on the internet for nearby festivals and events that are within a day or two's drive and plan a short family vacation.

, As your child grows up, it's important that they see people who look like them represented in the stories they read and the toys they play with. Look not just for books and toys with a ""cultural"" bent, but those that involve regular children doing everyday things.You want your child to recognize and appreciate the diversity of humanity, not see themselves as ""other"" or ""less than"" simply because of the color of their skin.
Maintaining a diverse selection of books and toys that include children of many different races and ethnic backgrounds will help teach your child about diversity and equality from a young age.

Learn what to expect from your community.",How to Adopt a Child if You Are Gay," Most states don't have specific laws dictating who can adopt based on sexual orientation. Unfortunately, certain states still have laws that make it more difficult for LGBT people to adopt. Since your state's laws will have a big effect on the adoption process, be sure to read up on exactly what to expect.In most states, the decision as to whether gay adoption by two people is legal is made on a case-by-case basis when the adoption is finalized.Some states allow joint-couple adoptions, making it easier for a gay couple to adopt together. Joint adoptions are legal in all states where gay marriage is legal.
Other states only allow one member of the couple to adopt. In this case, a separate second parent adoption is often an option.;
, If you live in a state where LGBT adoption is restricted, it certainly doesn't mean that adoption will be impossible. It may just be a longer, more complicated process. Finding in-state resources to guide you through the legal procedures in your state is key. That way you'll have support in place in case you encounter challenges.


Contact your state's equality organization.There you'll find information about how to adopt as an LGBT family or single person in your area.
Consider connecting with other LGBT adoptive parents in your state as well. Knowing other people who have been through the process is invaluable.
You may also want to speak with an attorney. Laws change frequently, and it will be helpful to discuss them with someone who is up to date.

, As an LGBT individual or couple, you may have more challenges than others do when it comes to adopting a child. That's why it's very important to use an agency that has your best interests in mind. This is especially true if you live in a state with restrictive adoption laws.An LGBT-supportive adoption agency will have experience navigating the laws and completing successful LGBT adoptions.
An adoption agency that does not actively support LGBT adoptions could become an obstacle. It will be up to the agency to present your file to potential birth mothers, do a home visit, and so on. It's imperative that they don't have an underlying prejudice against you before proceedings even begin.

, Look closely at their websites to determine whether they are supportive of LGBT adoptions. Check out the pictures, read the literature, and look for signs that they are LGBT friendly. Many agencies will provide a special page on the site with information for LGBT families. You should feel comfortable with the agency from the get-go.Be alert to any red flags that may be cause to rule out an agency. For example, agencies with a traditional religious affiliation. no pictures of same-sex couples and no mention of same-sex adoption may not be the best choice.
If possible, ask other LGBT adoptive parents for a referral as you get started on your search for an agency.

, You may also request an in-person meeting so you can ask questions in person. This will help you get a feel for the agency's attitude toward and policies for LGBT families. Ask the following questions to determine whether the agency will be a good choice for you:


How many LGBT families has the agency worked with?
What percentage of all families the agency represents are LGBT?
How long do LGBT families typically wait to get matched with a child?
If it's in a state with restrictive laws, how does the agency navigate restrictions regarding LGBT adoption?

, If you would like to adopt an infant, the birth mother will probably have a say in who gets to adopt her child. It will be the agency's job to present her with good potential matches. Make sure the agency regularly presents birth mothers with LGBT candidates if they believe they are a good match.The agency should present LGBT candidates unless the birth mother specifically requests heterosexual candidates only.
This particular issue can result in a very long wait time for LGBT candidates, especially in more conservative regions. Make sure the agency does everything possible to ensure fair treatment for LGBT candidates.

, If you are considering international adoption, it's important to find an agency that has a specific plan regarding LGBT families. Ask how they navigate cultural and legal differences when it comes to placing children from other countries with LGBT families.

, In addition to being LGBT supportive, the agency you choose should offer the options that are right for your family. See How to Adopt a Child for more information on the ins and outs of different types of adoptions. Here are some factors to consider when you're making your choice:


Do you want to adopt an infant or an older child?
Do you want to adopt domestically or would you prefer an international adoption?
Do you want an open or closed adoption?
Do you want to adopt a child from the foster care system or a private agency?

, Due to the fact that many parts of the US still have discriminatory practices toward LGBT families, it's no wonder that many people feel insecure about revealing their sexual orientation right away. You may be afraid that it will disqualify you from being able to pursue adoption with that agency. However, it's best to be up front about this important part of your life right away. Here's why:You have the law on your side, even in restrictive states. Even in places where gay marriage isn't legal, a single LGBT person can adopt.
If you reveal your sexual orientation, you'll be able to gauge the agency's attitude and abilities immediately. If you sense unfriendliness or a lack of willingness to engage, you should rule out that agency and find a better one.

, Every agency has some version of an interview process and home study. These are geared toward getting to know you better, assessing your financial status, and evaluating your home. Before an agency will match you with a child, they want to know what kind of parent you'll be and whether you're financially up to the task. Although this may sound intimidating, the best course it to be yourself. Put your best foot forward and don't try to hide anything.Withholding any type of important information, including your sexual orientation, can be grounds for excluding you from the application process.
You'll undergo a background check, financial evaluation, and more. The process may feel invasive. However, if you feel that the person interviewing you or conducting a home visit is asking inappropriate questions or exhibiting prejudice toward you because of your sexual orientation, this is inappropriate. Inform his or her supervisor.

, After you've completed your agency's requirements for adoption, they will begin the process of matching you with a baby or child. This can take months, and even years in some cases, but eventually a match will be found and you'll get to meet the child.


If you're adopting an infant, the birth mother will select you based on a profile you submit. You'll usually meet with the birth mother one or more times prior to the birth. After the baby is born, you'll be able to legally adopt the child.
If you're adopting an older child through the foster system or a domestic or foreign agency, your case worker or social worker will spend months finding a good match. At the end of the matching process, you will get to meet the child and mutually decide if it's a good fit.

, Work with an attorney to file the necessary paperwork to complete the adoption. Depending on the state, you'll need to fill out a petition for adoption. After the paperwork has been filed, you'll have a court hearing, during which a judge will decide whether to legally recognize the adoption.


For infant adoptions, the birth mother may need to be present to sign over her parental rights.
In court, you may be asked to speak about your intent to love and care for the child as your own.

, If you adopted a child as a single parent, your partner won't have legal parental rights. He or she will need to go through the adoption process separately before being recognized as the child's legal guardian.If both partners are equally involved in parenting, this is an important step to take for the health and security of your child.For example, in the event of a medical emergency, a partner who is not the child's legal guardian will not be able to make medical decisions for the child.
Other complications involving the child's education, finances, and so on could arise.

, If during any part of the adoption process you feel you are being treated unfairly because of your sexual orientation, contact an LGBT advocacy organization for help. You may be advised to have a mediation or switch adoption agencies, depending on your situation., From start to finish, the process of adopting a child can be complicated and emotionally taxing. Every state has support groups for LGBT families going through all stages of adoption. From choosing an agency to getting through home visits to enduring the long wait before at match is found, it helps to have the support of others who care.


Contact your state's equality organization for a list of support groups in your area.
Meet with people either online or in person, and keep in touch throughout your journey. Once you have adopted a child, you may want to stay involved to help others just starting out.
Financing adoption can be very difficult. Some LGBT organizations provide grants and financial aid to help out., Adopting a child is just the beginning. Navigating daycare, school, public programs and more can be more difficult as an LGBT family, especially if you are in a conservative state. As the adoption process comes to a close, find out more about how to handle the next steps you'll be taking as a family.


Look into neighborhoods, daycares, schools, medical facilities and churches that are LGBT supportive.
Decide how you will discuss your situation with teachers, doctors, classmates, and others who question your family structure.

If you are married, then at least one spouse must be a citizen.Each foreign country also has eligibility requirements. You can find them by visiting the State Department’s website at http://travel.state.gov/content/adoptionsabroad/en/country-information.html and selecting the country you are interested in adopting from.
To adopt a child from Egypt, for example, the parents cannot be over 55 years of age. The couple must be married and not have more than two children. Furthermore, at least one spouse must be of Egyptian nationality.;
, Many private adoption agencies help prospective parents adopt internationally. In order to adopt from a foreign country, you often need to work additionally with a foreign adoption agency. Your home-based agency can help you find an acceptable foreign agency. A representative of your U.S.-based agency can also accompany you to the foreign country and help guide you through the process.To find an adoption agency that handles intercountry adoptions, you should visit the Child Welfare Gateway, which is a service of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. They have a directory available at https://www.childwelfare.gov/nfcad/. You can select your state and then “Private Intercountry Adoption Agencies.”
To check that the agency is licensed, contact them and ask for their license number. They should happily provide it. Then contact the state licensing authority and check that the agency’s license is current.If you are adopting from a country that is a party to the Hague Convention, then you need a “Hague Approved” adoption agency. An agency will be identified as such in the Child Welfare directory.If you are not adopting from a Hague Convention country, then the agency does not need to be “Hague approved.”
Before deciding to hire the agency, ask for at least three referrals. You should call the references and ask how happy the families were with the agency’s handling of their intercountry adoption.

, Should you work with an adoption agency, then the agency’s own lawyer will handle any legal issues that arise. However, if you choose not to work with an adoption agency, then you will certainly need an experienced adoption attorney to help you navigate the many different requirements.


You can find a qualified adoption attorney by visiting the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys.Once at the website, you can click on “Find an Attorney” and search by state.Call and ask about the attorney’s experience. You will want to hire an attorney who has experience in intercountry adoptions, not just domestic adoptions.

, If you adopt a child from a country covered by the Hague Convention, then you will need to undergo 10 hours of training.The Hague Convention covers over 75 countries. A list can be found at the State Department’s website at http://travel.state.gov/content/adoptionsabroad/en/hague-convention/convention-countries.html. If the country you are adopting from is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, then you only need to take training if required by your state.Your adoption agency should be able to connect you with the required training programs.

, There are many forms and documents you must fill out or create in order to successfully adopt a child. You should give yourself plenty of time, as an intercountry adoption can take over a year to complete from start to finish:Complete a dossier. This will take two to four months. You will create the dossier with your adoption agency. It will include a variety of documents related to your home and finances.
Apply to the federal government for approval. You need to be pre-approved for an international adoption, which will require that you fill out and submit various forms. This process also takes two to four months to complete.
Submit a dossier to the foreign country. After you submit it, the foreign country can take up to six months to process. You cannot get a referral to adopt a child until the dossier is processed.
Wait for a referral. Referral times can vary widely. For adoptions from China, prospective parents now wait roughly eight months to receive a referral.Travel to the foreign country. You will need to schedule a trip to the foreign country to see the child. In some countries, you might need to stay for up to two weeks. In other countries, you will need to make two trips.
File the dossier in the United States. Once you return to the United States with the child, you need to file for a court date in order to complete the adoption. This step typically takes one to three months.

, The home study will determine your suitability for adoption. It will be submitted to the United States Customs and Immigration Service (USCIS) and the foreign country’s adoption agency. If you are adopting from a Hague Convention country, then the home study must be submitted with your initial application. If you are adopting from a non-Hague country, then you have a year to submit your home study., A licensed social worker will need to assess the safety and comfort of your house. You should begin by cleaning it. Take out any trash, accumulated newspapers/magazines, or old toys or clothes. Pay particular attention to the bathroom. Make sure there is sufficient hot and cold water and repair any loosened tiles or broken shower curtain rods.


See to it that the house has sufficient light and ventilation. Put screens on the window and replace broken light bulbs.
Also address safety concerns. Walk through the home and see if you can find anything that might endanger a child. Make sure to conceal exposed wires and repair broken or wobbly banisters and steps. Lock up firearms and store chemicals out of the reach of children.
Check about bedroom requirements. Some states require that the child have his or her own bedroom. States may also limit how many children can share the same bedroom. Your adoption agency can share the list of requirements.

, The precise requirements for your home study will differ depending on your state and the country you are adopting from. However, you most certainly will need to be interviewed in your home. All adults who live in the home must be interviewed.You should be prepared to talk about why you want to adopt, as well as what you think your strengths and weaknesses as a parent are. Be prepared to also discuss any domestic violence or sexual abuse that you have either suffered or witnessed, either as an adult or as a child. The home evaluator wants to assess how suitable you are for parenting a child.
Always be truthful with the home evaluator. If you try to cover up information (such as arrests), then you will only harm yourself in the eyes of the home evaluator.

, Each adult will need a criminal history check. You must disclose any arrest or conviction, otherwise your application could be rejected., You will need to submit a dossier to the foreign country’s central adoption agency. The dossier contains a variety of information and will take several months to complete. You will create it with your adoption agency and tailor it to the requirements of the foreign country. A typical dossier includes:the home study
medical reports
information on finances and employment
copies of important documents, such as birth certificates and marriage certificates
certificates that show completion of any required adoption education
letters of reference

, You cannot enter foreign countries without a valid passport, so make sure that yours has not expired. If you need to renew your passport, you can do so by mail. See the State Department’s webpage at http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/renew.html for more information.



Get a US Passport also contains helpful tips and information for those getting their first passport.

, In order to bring a child legally into the United States, you need the USCIS to pre-approve you. You must be found suitable for adoption. You can apply for this pre-approval by completing specific forms. The form you use will depend on what country you are adopting from.


If you are adopting from a country that is not a party to the Hague Convention, then you will need to fill out Form I-600A, Application for Advance Processing of an Orphan Petition.Work with your adoption agency or attorney to make sure that the form is filled out completely and accurately.
If you are adopting from a Hague Convention country, then you will need to complete Form I-800A, Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country., Once you have identified a specific child to adopt, you will need to complete the applicable petition, which you can download from the USCIS website. Alternately, your adoption agency will get the forms for you.


Form I-600, Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative. Use this form when adopting a child from a non-Hague country.
Form I-800, Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative. You will use this when adopting from a Hague Convention country.Your adoption agency will advise you on the timing of these petitions. For some countries, you can identify the child you want to adopt before leaving to visit the foreign country. For other countries, you won’t know what child you have been offered until you are actually in the country.

, You will largely not be in control of anything that happens related to the adoption once you arrive in the foreign country. You will need to pad extra days into your visit in case you are delayed for some reason.


Talk with your U.S.-based adoption agency about how much time you need to complete the adoption.

, Depending on the country you are adopting from, you might not know anything about the child when you show up in the foreign country. In some countries, the process will be different. You will be sent information about the child to your home address and you will make a decision whether to adopt the child before traveling to the foreign country. For a Chinese adoption, you will be sent photographs, some medical information, as well as the child’s name and birthdate., In order to be issued a visa to travel to the U.S., the child must be medically examined in his or her home country by an approved doctor. The purpose of this medical examination is to screen the child for certain infectious or contagious diseases.The medical exam required by the U.S. Department of State is not comprehensive.If you want a more in depth examination so that you know the health of the child, then you will need to schedule and pay for a more comprehensive examination.

, In many countries, you will need to complete the adoption in the foreign country. In all likelihood you will not be able to leave with the child until you have the adoption approved.

, You may need to register the child with a state agency before you leave. If this is the case, make sure you follow the necessary instructions in order to lawfully complete the adoption process.

, You will need to go to the U.S. Consulate in the foreign country to complete paperwork and be interviewed so that you can get a visa for the child’s travel and entry to the United States.Your adoption agency’s representative should help you with this process.


Different visas are issued if you are adopting from a Hague Convention country or not. However, the process of being interviewed should not be substantially different.
One difference is timing. You will submit the visa application before the foreign adoption in a Hague Convention country but after the adoption proceedings in a non-Hague country. Talk to your adoption agency, who is familiar with these timing requirements.

, Depending on your circumstances, you may need to petition a court in the United States to adopt the child. If you fully adopted the child in the foreign country, then you will not need to re-adopt in the U.S.Nevertheless, you have the option to re-adopt in the U.S. You might choose to do so if you want a state birth certificate or if you want to rename the child.To adopt, your lawyer or the adoption agency will file the necessary petition with the court. You will then probably have to attend a hearing. As the birth mother is in a foreign country, there should not be anyone at the hearing opposing your petition.

, It is normal for many parents with new adoptees to seek counseling for themselves or for the child. Often, children have difficulty adjusting to a new culture. Also, adoptive parents often seek to understand how they can support their child’s heritage. You should ask the adoption agency what post-adoption services they offer, or if they can refer you to services.


For example, you might want to join a support group. A support group can offer a variety of services, including family events, discussion groups, education workshops and newsletters, as well as community referrals.If you adopt a child from a foreign country, there might be a support group made up of other parents who have also adopted from the same country.

, Some countries will require that you submit information to them periodically to report on the child’s welfare and health. Each country’s requirements are different, and you should contact your adoption agency with questions.Be sure to make required reports. Although the foreign country cannot come and take your child away, you will hurt the ability of other people to adopt from the foreign country if you decline to provide necessary reports.

Don't make assumptions.,

Reinforce positive behavior.",How to Deal With Disrespectful Children," If a child is being disrespectful, you should acknowledge the behavior right away. Ignoring the behavior will encourage them to continue until they get your attention.For example, say you are at home trying to talk on the phone. Your child is interrupting you continually. You can say something like ""Sweetie, I know you are trying to get my attention, but I'm busy right now so you are just going to have to wait and be quiet."" This shows your child that you see what he or she is doing and then allows you explain what the child should do instead.;
, If you tell a child to stop with no explanation, your child may not see a reason to stop. Once you have identified what your child is doing, explain to your child why his or her behavior is wrong or disrespectful. This will help your child understand the necessity of good manners.Let's return to the phone example. If your child continues to interrupt, say something like, ""I'm on the phone. It's not nice to interrupt me while I am trying to talk to someone else as I'm unable to give the person I'm talking to my full attention.""
You can also suggest an alternative behavior. For example, say something like, ""Can you wait for a pause in the conversation if you really need something?"", If you try to talk rationally with disrespectful children, and they still continue to misbehave, you need to explain the consequences of their actions. Then, if they continue to disrespect you, make sure you carry out the consequences.Never tell your child that there are consequences for doing something and not carry through. If children are told they will get in trouble, but don't get in trouble, they will continue to misbehave. Make sure you tell them a consequence that can be definitely carried through.

, If you have to discipline a child, make sure you do so appropriately. Not all forms of punishment work and punishment types depends on the age of the child and the severity of his or her behavior.


Isolation or physical forms are punishment are discouraged. Do not, for example, send a child to his or her room or give him or her a spanking. Physical punishment can be frightening for a child, especially a young child, and physically isolating the child misses an opportunity to help him or her develop. Ideally, punishment should teach children how to connect, communicate, and work through negative behaviors. Isolating a child does not allow him or her to come to terms with why the behavior was wrong.Try to think less in terms of discipline and more in terms of consequences. Choose consequences that make sense. Taking away a favorite toy may not really teach a child why interrupting your conversation is wrong. You should also apply consequences immediately after the behavior occurs. Make sure the consequence of a child behavior reflects why it was wrong. For example, if your child is interrupting you on the phone the behavior is bad because it's disrespectful to your time. You might have the child do a small chore you would normally do, like drying the dishes, to show him or her that your time is valuable as you're very busy with household tasks and work., As a teacher, especially if you're working with young children, it's better to offer an alternative behavior than scold a child for disobedience. Provide direct, clear instructions on how a child should behave when you see him or her behaving poorly.


When a child is behaving poorly, explain to him/her how he/she should be behaving. Then, provide a solid reason why the alternative behavior you're suggesting is better.For example, say you're on a field trip to a swimming pool and you see one of your students running through the water. Instead of saying, ""Mason, no running"" say something like, ""Mason, walk in the slipper water. It's safer that way, as you'll avoid falling and getting hurt."" Children tend to be more receptive to being told what to do rather than simply being scolded for bad behavior., Timeout is no longer a popular disciplinary practice for young children as isolating a child can be frustrating. However, a time-in can remove a child from a distressful situation. If you suspect one of your students is behaving poorly due to stress or overexertion, propose a time-in.


Create private, cozy areas of your classroom where students can sit and relax if they're being disruptive. Provide pillows, photo albums, books, stuffed toys, and other calming supplies.The basic idea is that the child is not being punished. He is simply learning that he needs to regulate emotions better if he wants to participate in class. He is not being isolated in an unfriendly environment, as in a traditional time out, but rather being placed in an alternative environment where he can calm down.Remember, discipline should be a learning opportunity. When you have a spare moment, address the child. Talk to him or her about why the behavior was disruptive. Brainstorm ideas together on how to better cope the next time he or she gets emotional or rowdy in class.While this approach is often used at school, parents could benefit from a time-in as well. If you are a parent, try having a designated time-in space in your home where your child can go to calm down if he's struggling to regulate his emotions.

, Use positive statements and avoid negatives. Children may be disrespectful if they feel they're being disrespected. Don't use statements like, ""I'm not going to help you with that problem until you try to work it out yourself."" This will make the child feel he's done something wrong by struggling. Instead, say ""I think you'll learn more if you try to work out the problem yourself first. Once you do that, I can try to help you."" Using statements that are positive will reinforce the idea that you respect the child and are treating him or her like an adult.

, If a child treats you poorly or disrespectfully, try not to take it personally. Teachers often feel stressed out if children are mean to them or act out in class. It's likely your child is just trying to assert his or her independence or is dealing with something else and are taking it out on you.Remember that children can often react in rash ways. Just because a child says, ""I hate you"" that doesn't mean this is true. Try to remember that children often disrespect their parents or authority figures as a way of testing power structures.

, If the situation is not improving, it may be time you seek help. The child may be dealing with something and unwilling to talk about it with you. Also, something may be going on at home and he or she may need space to talk it out. Talk to your school's principal or counselor if you're worried a child may have an underlying issue preventing him of her from behaving in class., Sometimes, the best means of discipline is simple prevention. Try to work to foster a home or school atmosphere that prevents bad behavior. Look for things that trigger bad behavior and find ways to modify those situations to make your child more comfortable.


Know what triggers a tantrum. For example, your 3-year-old may always throw a fit if you're at the grocery store for over an hour. With kids, the most common reason for bad behavior is that the child is hungry, tired, scared, or confused. Keep in mind an hour is much longer than a 3-year-old than it is for you. Is there any way you could make such trips more bearable? Could you allow your child to bring some toys to the store? Could you maybe have a babysitter watch the child if you're going to be long.Allow your child to have some control. If a child's request is not unreasonable, it's sometimes better to accommodate this request. This shows a child you respect him or her and also helps avoid child/parent power struggles. Say your daughter loves her summer dress, but it's getting to be fall and chilly outside. Instead of forbidding she wear the dress, maybe allow her to wear it in the colder months provided that she wear a coat and pants alongside the dress.When your child is misbehaving, take a few moments to consider what preventative you could have taken to prevent this. What is triggering the behavior? Is there any way some of your child's requests could be abided? Is there anything you can do in the future to avoid such an outburst., You can't establish appropriate boundaries and discipline if you don't understand why your child is behaving poorly. Work to try to get inside your child's head and understand the roots of the behavior.


When your child is upset, work to connect with him or her on an emotional level. Say something like, ""It seems like you're feeling very angry about this. Why is that?""There may be reasons you did not think of that a child is acting out. Discovering that reason can help you figure out how to better deal with the situation in the moment. For example, if your child cries every night when you put him or her to bed your child might be scared of the dark. He might have also seen something on television that was frightening. Rather than scolding the child the next time you have to put him to bed, take a few moments to talk through your child's fears and reassure him that he's safe in your home., Raising a child is about teaching positive behaviors and not just discouraging negative ones. One of the most important things you can teach a child is empathy. When your child is misbehaving, talk to him or her about why that behavior is hurtful to others.


If your child has behaved poorly, talk about that behavior and why it hurt another person. For example, say your son stole another student's pencil at lunch and then broke it. Sit your son down and say, ""I know the bunny pencil you got last Easter was important to you. How would you feel if someone had taken that from you without asking?"" Allow your child to answer. Teaching a child to relate to another person is the groundwork for empathy.Once your child has stopped to consider the other person's point of view, then have your child apologize. Many people force children to apologize as a ritual, and the child learns to do little other than mimic back what the adult said. However, making your child consider the reason for the apology first encourages empathetic thinking., Modeling is one of the best ways to teach children how to behave appropriately. Try to behave like the person you want your child to grow up to be. Practice good manners. Be kind to others. Stay calm during trying situations. Talk about your emotions openly and show your child how to deal with things like sadness, anger, and other negative feelings in a manner that's constructive and appropriate., If your child or a child you are working with acts out, don't make assumptions about his or her life. Don't assume a child is just disrespectful. Take time to talk with him or her to find the real source of the problem. The difficult thing about making assumptions is it may cause you to treat a child in a different way. If you assume your child is just being moody, you may not respond with as much love. If you think the child is dealing with deeper issues, you may be tempted to excuse the behavior. Try to stay consistent with your consequences and your actions when a child acts up, but learn from that child what they are feeling and why.

, The power struggle exists because two people are battling over who has power over the other. While you want to show your child that you have authority and need to be respected, you want to do so in a calm, respectful way. Avoid raising your voice at them, yelling at children or talking to them in the same way they are talking to you. If your child is throwing a tantrum, he or she likely hasn't developed adequate problem solving skills. Try to assess and address your child's needs rather than forcing him or her to obey your rules.Show the child that the two of you can handle a problem without getting into a defiant power struggle. Sit the child down and try to talk about what is going on and how the two of you can work together to fix it. If the child is still acting disrespectful and refuses to engage in mature conversation, then give the child time to cool off and don't engage in another argument.
Don't let a child manipulate you. Children will often try to negotiate with you or manipulate you to get what they want, but make sure you stand firm while remaining calm. , If you want your child to behave better, using positive reinforcement can help. Praise your child for small changes in behavior. This can help him learn what behaviors are appropriate.


Focus on the behaviors you want to change. For example, say your child frequently interrupts others. Explain why these behaviors are negative and then watch for small changes. Many parents set the bar too high and expect a child to change completely overnight. Instead, be on the lookout for small changes.Say you are on the phone one day and your son is interrupting you. However, he quiets down the first time you ask instead of continuing to bother you after being corrected. While he still interrupted, he's making an effort to change.When you're off the phone, praise your child for this small change. Say something like, ""Isaac, I really appreciated how you stopped talking when I asked."" Eventually, the child will learn what behaviors are desirable and act accordingly."

Identify the level of talking back.,
Be calm and think before you speak.,
Be firm and consistent with your actions.,
Listen and understand.,
Just walk away.,
Make sure that your teen is aware of the consequences.It's important that your teen is aware that he/she is not supposed to talk back to you, and that you won't tolerate that kind of treatment.,
Call your teens out on what they said.,
Talk to your teen once you've both calmed down.,
Discuss the house rules.,
Assign a time for your teen to express their feelings.,
Understand the importance of consequences.,
Set a punishment related to the misbehavior.,
Ground your teenager.,
Let your teen figure things out for themselves.",How to Deal with a Teen Who Talks Back," There is a huge variation in what different parents define as talking back - for some it might involve the teen interrupting you while you're speaking to them, for others it might involve the teen shouting or screaming at you when the conversation isn't going the way they want.


Talking back usually involves the teen muttering, trying to explain themselves, negotiating, or responding negatively to your orders. In more serious cases, the teen may curse at you, call you or their other relatives/siblings names, or make threats.
It's important to identify the level of talking back and how serious the problem is before you decide on the course of action. Some teens will simply need the opportunity to express their opinion, while others will need to be disciplined.;
, When your teen talks back to you, you have to keep your head together and avoid snapping at him/her or saying something you'll regret.


Remember to keep eye contact with your teen, this will show them that you are the parent and that you deserve respect. Do not threaten the teen or yell at him/her, just calmly explain that you do not like his/her attitude.
Let your teen know that you will listen to him/her if he/she listens to you - it's only fair. Set a good example for your teen by being calm and level-headed.

, You might be surprised by how teens can remember certain situations from the past and then use them against you.


For example, if your teen wanted to go on a date and you said no, but later changed your answer, he/she will simply push you harder the next time you say no, because he/she'll expect you to give in like you did last time. Rules should be rules and consequences should be consequences, as this allows everyone (particularly your teen) to know where they stand.
So if you make a rule that there will be no dates on school nights, you need to stick to that rule and not bend or break it under any circumstances. Otherwise your teen will sense a weak spot and continue to wheedle and talk back until he/she gets his/her way. There should be no negotiation allowed. Remember that consistency is the key when it comes to enforcing rules.

, When your teen says, “You don’t understand!” don’t answer with “I understand,” as this will just lead to more talking back and the argument will be prolonged.


Instead, make an effort to listen and once the teen has finished his rant, he/she will feel calmer and more willing to listen to your side of things. Once you hear where your teen is coming from, it will be easier for you to understand the source of their frustration and find ways to explain the situation to them so they understand it.
For example, you may learn that your teen thinks that you're not letting him/her go hang out with his/her friends out of meanness. Once you explain to him/her that you're not letting him/her go because you need his/her help with something or because you're worried about him/her, he/she may be able to deal with your decision a little better.

, This is effective when you feel like your teen has a lot of complaining and back talking to do, and refuses to listen to reason. If they're being particularly obnoxious, just walking away and refusing to listen them can prevent you from losing your temper with them.


When you walk away, it does not mean that you are oblivious to your child's feelings and concerns, it just means that you don’t want the tension to escalate. You can say, “I’m not going to talk to you right now. We’ll talk later when you’ve calmed down.” This shows that you have heard enough talking back and intend to give your teen time to think about his/her actions.
Although this may not always be the best way to go, sometimes you just have to walk away from your teen to help you avoid talking out of anger. Conversations are always easier when both parties are calm and collected, rather than tense and angry.

, Your teen should also know that if he/she breaks this rule, there will be consequences.


If this is just the first time that your teen has talked back, then you can just tell the teen that you don't approve of his/her behavior and that you expect better next time. It's important to make your child aware of the boundaries before you begin to enforce them.
However, when the talking back happens repeatedly, then it's important that you follow through with your promises and show the teen that there are consequences for his/her actions. Otherwise, your teen will see the ""no talking back"" rule as an empty threat and they will continue to push boundaries in future.

, Some teens won't talk back directly, but will mutter or mumble things under their breath. In this situation, it's important to call your teen out and ask them to clarify what they said. You could say, “I hear you mumbling something, can you say it louder so I can hear?”


Make sure that your voice is calm but assertive. This will let your teen know that you are the boss and that you won't tolerate any underhanded insults.
Keep in mind that your teen may already feel ashamed of themselves for what they said, and they may be reluctant to repeat themselves.

, It is a good idea to talk to your teen when he/she is calm or in a good mood. This will make it easier for you to understand things from his/her perspective, and you will discover more about your teen’s life. This is also a good time to lay down rules and consequences if ever your child talks back again.

, Discuss your relationship with each other and agree upon some ground rules. It's essential that you clarify your expectations with regards to your teen’s behavior, along with the consequences he can expect if he/she breaks the rules.

, Keep in mind that talking back is a method of expression by teenagers - you just need to teach them to express themselves in more mature ways. Set up a certain time of the day in which your teen can calmly explain his/her feelings on a certain subject and challenge your previous decisions.


This will not only serve as an outlet of expression for your child, but will make your child calmer and help them to understand the situation.
Remember that it's better for your child to talk to you (even if they are angry or upset with you) rather than bottling everything up and keeping you in the dark about what they're going through.

, In order to manage your teen's behavior, it's important that he/she is aware of the consequences of both good and bad behavior. These consequences may come in the form of punishment for bad behavior or rewards for good behavior.

, For example, if the teen was late for curfew coming home one night, then the consequence can be an earlier curfew the following night, or not being allowed to go out at all.


Another example may be if your teen is playing a video game and talks back when you are trying to have a conversation with him/her, you could ban him/her from playing video games altogether.

, One common punishment for teens is to withdraw some of their privileges, or even ground them. For example, if your teen talks back when you're trying to set some ground rules about him/her going out with friends, you could prevent him/her from going out at all.

, An alternative solution to giving out punishments is to let your teen experience the logical consequence of his actions without your interference.


For example, if your teen doesn’t want to do his/her homework, don't say anything, just let him get in trouble with his/her teachers. For some kids, this will be enough to prevent them from skipping their homework again.
Or if your teen refuses to wear knee and elbow pads while skateboarding or biking, despite all your warnings, allow him/her to fall and scrape himself/herself up. Once he/she experiences that, he/she may be a lot more inclined to heed your advice.

Do you want to adopt a child in the U.S.? This is called a domestic adoption. However, you might have to wait a long time for a child to become available.
Do you want to adopt a child internationally? You might have a better chance at finding a child, but international adoptions can be complicated and more expensive.
Do you want a baby, or are you open to adopting an older child?
Would you like the child to be the same race, ethnicity, or religion as you? You might need to wait longer, depending on your preferences.;
, Check your phone book or perform an Internet search to find private agencies. Generally, private agencies provide full service, including adoption education, counseling, home studies, and post-adoption services. Adopting a child will cost you around $4,000-30,000.Make sure the agency is properly licensed. Call the Department of Social Services (DSS), Children’s Division, at 573-751-4954.
Also check with the Missouri State’s Attorney General’s Office to see if the agency has been sued., Instead of working with an agency, you can hire a lawyer. They can search for a child to adopt by contacting doctors, advertising in the newspaper, or helping you create a website.Make sure the lawyer specializes in adoption and not in another field. Obtain a referral from the Missouri bar association by calling 573-636-3635 or visiting www.mobar.org.
Discuss fees ahead of time. Lawyers charge different amounts depending on their experience and the complexity of the adoption. Generally, they charge $5,000-40,000.

, Missouri’s Department of Social Services handles the adoption process. There are about 2,000 foster children in Missouri awaiting adoption. You can either become a foster parent first or adopt the child directly.Some foster children are special needs, but don’t let that deter you from considering them. You can get money from the state, around $200-300 a month., Many people adopt from China, Eastern Europe, or Latin America. You should find an agency approved for Hague intercountry adoptions. International adoptions are complicated, so thoroughly research the adoption agency. International adoptions can cost up to $35,000.Ask for three or more referrals from people who have adopted through the agency and be sure to call them.
Ask the referrals how complicated the process was. Did the parents feel like they had sufficient support? Did someone from the agency travel with them to the foreign country?
Find out if there were hidden expenses or whether everything cost about what they expected.

, Before starting the adoption process, figure out how much work it will be. If you’re interested in a private adoption, contact the agency directly. If you want to adopt a foster child, then call DSS.

Discuss how long the adoption process takes. Times vary by type of adoption (domestic v. international) and the type of child you want.

, The foster agency should have an application you can fill out. There might be a paper application, or you can complete an application online. Generally, the agency will want basic background information to start, such as your name, age, race, employment, education, and salary., Contact an agency to obtain its list of requirements. If you’re looking to adopt a foster child, then you will need to meet the following requirements:You must be at least 21 years old.
You must pass a criminal record check for child abuse and neglect.
You’ll need a stable source of income.
Your home must meet certain licensing standards.
You must be in good mental and physical health.

, You can decide how much involvement the birth parents will have with the child. Closed adoptions used to be standard, but today there is no one way. Consider which works for you:

In a closed adoption, you and the birth parents won’t know each other. You’ll also have no contact after the adoption.In an open adoption, you will meet and know the identities of the birth parents. You can also choose to have continuing contact with one or both birth parents after the adoption.
There are many different degrees of open adoptions. For example, you might agree that the birth mother will write cards or letters to the child and you’ll send pictures. You can also agree to visits, if you want. The key is to decide what you want before searching for a child.

, With an open domestic adoption, you often meet the birth parents, who will choose which family gets to adopt the child.You should prepare thoroughly for your meetings. Often only the mother shows up.

You may put together an album of your family, including pictures of all family members and a short story about your life. Many agencies put this information on their webpages for birth mothers to look at.
The key is to be yourself. You don’t have to make the birth mother fall in love you.Also don’t make assumptions about the birth mother. Birth moms give up their children for a variety of reasons and come from all walks of life.
Nevertheless pay attention to whether the birth parents break appointments or tell conflicting stories. You don’t want to adopt a child if you think the parents will scam you., It’s illegal to buy a baby in Missouri. However, you can pay certain expenses to the birth parents in a reasonable amount, such as the following:legal costs
counseling
food
shelter
transportation
utilities

, Home studies are usually the lengthiest step in the adoption process. A social worker will want to review your family history, life, and home. Courts rely on the home study to determine you can provide a stable home before they’ll agree to let you adopt. Because it is so important, you should schedule the home study as soon as possible. Generally, the whole process can take up to eight weeks.States require that home studies be performed by licensed professionals. Check whether your agency is qualified to perform a home study.

, Your social worker should give you a complete checklist of documents. Gather them before your first meeting. For example, you typically need the following:

Get copies of the birth certificates for everyone in the family.
Obtain a copy of your marriage license if you are married.
Find financial information, such as tax returns, pay stubs, and income statements.
Ask your doctor to complete a health form. Medical conditions don’t automatically prevent you from adopting, but the agency will make a decision on a case-by-case basis., You’ll probably have to give fingerprints, so coordinate with your agency to get this done in a timely manner. The adoption agency will review any criminal arrests and may ask for follow-up information.

A conviction for a DUI or other criminal offense will not necessarily keep you from adopting. However, the agency will want to see proof that you’ve rehabilitated yourself, such as by completing drug or alcohol counseling.

, You’ll need to have at least one in-home meeting with the social worker. They will want to talk with each family member to assess your readiness to adopt.You should be prepared to discuss the following:

Your motivations for adopting a child.
Your own experiences with your family growing up.
Your marriage (if you’re married).
Your thoughts about discipline.

, The social worker also must make sure your home is safe for a child. You’ll have a chance to fix any problems the social worker finds, so don’t stress out. Nevertheless, you should prepare by doing the following:

Fix any obvious hazards, such as exposed wires, holes in the floor, or rickety stairways.
Secure any firearms and ammunition in separate containers.
Place chemicals (such as bleach and detergent) in cabinets outside the reach of children.
Make sure you have sufficient heat, hot water, and running water.

, After you bring your child home, consider whether to take time off. You are covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires that most employers give their employees unpaid time off.Talk with your Human Resources department if you have questions., You can expect a social worker to visit you in the months after you bring your child home. You’ll discuss how you’re adjusting and share any information from pediatrician visits. The number of visits will vary.

If you had an international adoption, you may need to complete a post-placement home study and send pictures or updates to the home country., Missouri law requires that you wait six months before a judge will finalize the adoption.Generally, this is nothing to worry about, but you should consult with a lawyer if you have questions.

Once your adoption is approved, you have the same rights as a biological parent. A new birth certificate will be printed with your names as the adoptive parents.

, Adoptive parents often experience many emotions—excitement at the presence of the child, confusion about whether they’ll be good parents, etc. You should see if you can find a support group near you."

However, it's imperative that you do this as carefully as you can. Otherwise your teen will just get upset back at you, and may be less likely to communicate with you about other things.Don't act triumphant or satisfied by catching your teen in a lie. Your teen's safety should be your number one priority.
State things as a matter of fact. Be direct and open without being aggressive.
Say something like, ""I want to talk to you about something. You told me _____ the other day, but I know for a fact that you were lying. I've talked to _____ and they told me your story isn't true.""
Ask your teen directly why he or she felt the need to lie to you.;
, It's incredibly important that you don't lose your temper while dealing with your teen's lies. The situation is already difficult, and getting angry or upset will only make the situation worse.If you remain calm, your teen is more likely to continue carrying on a conversation with you. If you yell, though, your teen may just storm off.It's okay if you're upset, but don't take your anger out on your teenager.That will only make a bad situation worse.
Calm down before talking to your teenager when you've found out he/she has lied to you.
Take deep breaths, try counting to 10, go for a walk, or make a cup of tea or coffee before you sit down to talk with your teen.
Say something like, ""Go wait in your room. I'll be up shortly, and we're going to talk about what happened.""
Try to remain calm when you do talk. Your teen is likely to get upset, so you'll need to be the steady, rational one in this conversation.

, Start out by letting your teen know that his/her lies have hurt you and weakened your trust. This doesn't mean trying to guilt your teen, but you should let your teen know that his/her lies affect you and have a negative impact on your parent/child relationship.Don't call your teen a liar or label your teen as untrustworthy. You should let your teen know that lying weakens your ability to trust him/her, though.
Use your moment of disapproval as an opportunity to teach your teen a lesson.
Try to focus on the risky behavior your teen is engaging in rather than the lie.Talk about what happened and why your teen made the decisions that were made. Try to get at the reasons behind the lie so that you can better understand your teen's behavior.
Ask what your teen can do differently next time (both to avoid the situation that was lied about and to avoid lying to you).

, The best way to prevent future lies is by making your teen feel that you are approachable. If your teen feels like he/she can come to you with problems or to confess bad behavior without getting yelled at or punished, it will make your teen more likely to trust you (and by extension, you'll be able to trust your teen as well).


Remember that correcting a habit of lying is a process, not something that can be solved with a simple solution. Your teen needs to feel that he/she can be honest and open with you, which may take time.Let your teen know that you love him/her, and that you don't expect your teen to be perfect.
Tell your teen that he or she would be less likely to get into trouble by coming to you with the truth than by hiding it or lying to you.
You may want to consider offering your teen one last chance to come clean.
Tell your teen that if he or she is willing to be honest about the situation at hand, you'll forgive him/her this time and hold off on punishment.Make it clear that there will be strict punishment for lying next time.
You should also stress that when your teen lies to you, it makes it harder for you to have trust and grant freedom/independence to your teen.

, If your teen continues to engage in bad behavior and lie about it, he or she obviously hasn't learned a lesson yet. If this happens, you may need to start enforcing the rules and punishing your teen when you find out about lies in the future.Tell your teen what will happen if you catch a lie in the future (grounded, loss of privileges, additional chores, no allowance, etc) and enforce that consequence if it happens again.
Never resort to acts of violence as ""punishment."" Physically abusing your teen is illegal and immoral, and it will destroy any chance for a healthy relationship.
Most teens want more freedom (and many lie to get that freedom). By restricting your teen's access to freedom, you will ideally be teaching your teen that the only way to get that independence is through honesty and good behavior.

, Most compulsive liars get something out of lying. Often this type of behavior is motivated by issues involving self-esteem. If your teen is compulsively lying, even in situations where there's no reason to lie (nothing to be gained and no punishment to be avoided), you may need to intervene.Reassure your teen that you love him or her.
Let your teen know that you're available to talk any time he/she is feeling unhappy or unsatisfied.
If your teen suffers from depression or has some other reason for compulsively lying, you may want to seek out a therapist who's qualified to work with adolescents.
Ask your teen's doctor or pediatrician for a recommendation. The doctor may know someone who specializes in adolescent depression and/or compulsive lying.
You can also search online for adolescent therapists in your area, or use the database at Psychology Today to find a specialist near you., For many teens, drugs and alcohol are a part of a passing phase of experimentation. However, this experimentation is not necessarily harmless. Even ""low-level"" intoxicants like alcohol and marijuana can have serious effects on your teen's health, especially since your teen is still growing and developing. Casual usage can also lead to addiction, and any usage could easily tarnish your teen's legal record if he or she gets caught.If your teen is engaging in drug or alcohol abuse, you should have a frank conversation about the dangers of drugs and alcohol, and if things don't improve you may need to enlist the help of a qualified mental health expert.Lying about illegal or dangerous behavior needs to be addressed directly. Often some underlying issue like depression, anxiety, or self-esteem problems will cause a teen to seek out intoxicants.
If your teen is lying about drugs or alcohol and talking to him/her hasn't helped, search online or in the phone book to find a mental health expert in your area who deals with adolescents and addiction.

, If you're worried about your teen telling you the truth, it may be helpful to know the things teens lie about most often. You can't accuse your teen of lying about everything, but if you know what your teen is most likely to lie about, you can prevent future instances of that behavior. Some of the most common behaviors teens lie about include:


how teens spend their time
what teens spend their allowance on
seeing friends that their parents don't approve of
which movies your teen sees and whom your teen goes with
what types of clothing your teen wears outside the house
drinking alcohol and/or doing drugs
driving under the influence or riding in cars with a driver who was under the influence
going to parties
having adult supervision outside the house

, It's tough to know when your teen is lying, and any suspicions should be approached very cautiously. Being overly suspicious of your teen actually makes you statistically less likely to know what your teen is lying about. You may be more likely to recognize your teen is lying about something when you're suspicious, but you'll probably be wrong about what your teen lies about and why.Accusing your teen of lying when he or she is actually telling the truth may make your teen less likely to be open and honest with you in the future.
Try to evaluate your teen's behavior in the context of his or her past patterns of behavior. If your teen is getting into trouble (or has a history of doing so), that teen may be more likely to lie to you.
Remember that no teen is lying about everything all the time. You may have your suspicions, but you need to recognize that your teen does tell the truth as well, and you need to be fair in your assessment of his/her honesty.

, Some parents may not be comfortable trying to catch their teens in a lie. However, if you have your suspicions and you want to put a stop to it, it may be worth considering checking out your teen's story. This can help establish a baseline of behavior so you'll know what to expect going forward.If your teen claims to have spent the day at a friend's house, call that friend's parents and confirm that this is true.
You may want to try quizzing your teen to see if he/she is telling the truth. Remember what your teen says, and ask follow-up questions later on to see if your teen sticks to the same story you were told earlier.
With that said, it's important to recognize that trying to ""trap"" your teen in a lie will only discourage open and honest communication with you.
Resist the urge to spy on your teen or go through his/her belongings. This can damage your teen's trust in you and set back your lines of communication.

, Whether you've caught your teen in a lie or you simply don't believe your teen's story, you should express this to your teen as calmly and directly as possible. Don't get mad, and don't accuse your teen of lying; instead, open a conversation about what your teen has told you.Don't interrogate your teen. That will only make your teen more likely to lie to you again.
Let your teen know that you don't entirely believe the story you're being told.
Give your teen a way out. He/she may be willing to tell the truth if you offer some type of immunity from punishment.
You can say something like, ""We're reasonably sure that you're not telling us the truth. Are you sure you want to stick with your version of events, or is there something else you'd like to tell us?""

, Many adults lie to other adults for the same basic reasons your teen may be lying to you: to avoid getting into trouble, or to be able to keep doing things you know you're not supposed to. Lying to others while you punish your teen for lying sets a bad example and makes you look like a hypocrite. Instead of lying to cover your tracks, be open and honest about your actions and your motivations. Then show your teen that it worked out much better for you to be honest about the situation.Avoid telling so-called ""white lies.""
Don't lie to your boss if you're late to work. Apologize for being late and start leaving for work a little earlier so it doesn't happen again.
Resist the urge to withhold information from your partner. Be honest and open, and show your teen how much better your relationship is because of that honesty.
Be honest if your teen asks you hard questions. Rather than lying about your past bad behavior, tell the truth and admit it was a mistake.

, Many teens who habitually lie to their parents have a hard time seeing their own inherent value. A good way to prevent future lies is by spending as much time as possible with your teen and conveying that you see tremendous potential in him/her.Spending time together lets you know what's going on in your teen's life, and it lets your teen feel that you're approachable if he/she needs to talk. It also shows that you take an interest in your teen and want what's best for him or her.


You should ideally aim to spend some time with your teen every day.
Open up an honest dialogue by talking about your day and asking your teen about his or her day.
You can try spending time together by doing something your teen enjoys. You might play video games together, go for a walk in the woods, or some other activity that will make your teen happy.

, As you spend time with your teen, convey the importance of honesty and communication. You don't have to say this explicitly, but you should let your teen feel that trust between the two of you helps you to know that your teen is safe and will make the right decisions.


Remind your teen that you will trust him or her more if you're shown honesty and trustworthiness. Let your teen know that lies make it hard to trust one another.
Don't punish your teen if he or she comes to you needing advice about a tricky situation. Doing so will only make your teen less likely to come to you for help in the future.

, If your teen learns how to make smart, healthy decisions, there's less of a chance your teen will need to lie to you about doing something wrong. Teens are most capable of independence when they're able to identify emotions, exhibit some sense of self-control, cope with unpleasant emotions, and make informed decisions to solve their own problems.Many teens lie to cover up behavior they know was bad. If you can eliminate that bad behavior, you should be able to trust your teen more and more.
Promote open discourse. Let your teen know that he or she can come to you for advice, and offer helpful feedback without judgment.
Talk to your teen about how to evaluate a situation and make the right decision.
You should also talk to your teen about how to cope with unpleasant feelings in healthy, productive ways.

, Teenagers typically want increasing amounts of freedom. They're approaching adulthood and want the independence to make their own decisions without having to ask for permission. While you'll still need to monitor your teen's behavior, you may need to give your teen a little more freedom if it means he/she will be more honest with you.If you're willing to compromise on things like what time your teen's curfew is, which friends your teen can spend time with, or where your teen can go, he or she is less likely to feel the need to lie.
Compromising doesn't mean giving in to all of your teen's demands, nor does it mean being unwilling to hear your teen's requests.
Sit down with your teen and work out a give-and-take solution. For example, if your teen's curfew is 9:00 PM and he or she wants to stay out until midnight, compromise on 10:30 or 11:00.
Be willing to make exceptions under certain conditions. For example, if your teen wants to go to a concert that will end past his or her curfew, let your teen go but offer to chaperone or drive your teen.
By compromising and simultaneously establishing some kind of presence in your teen's activities (as in the concert example), you can prevent your teen's need to lie about where he/she is, what time your teen will be home, and how your teen will get home.

, It's important to stress to your teen that the choices he/she makes will determine how much freedom and independence you'll give. This can make it feel less like punishment, since your teen will understand that you're responding to his or her behavior.


Give your teen the independence he or she wants, but make it clear that a violation of your trust will affect that level of freedom.
Remind your teen that independence as an adult comes with a great price. You can only maintain your independence as an adult if you follow certain social rules and laws, just as your teen must follow your rules at home.This leaves the ball in your teenager's court, so to speak. If your teen wants to maintain that independence or gain new freedoms, he or she will have to prove trustworthy.
Reward your teen with more independence as he/she demonstrates trustworthiness and honesty. You might try extending your teen's curfew or giving your teen extra allowance, for example.
Restrict your teen's freedom when you catch him/her lying. Remind your teen that you made it clear that lies will result in reduced freedom, and enforce the rules.

Try to plan for these triggers so you can avoid them.,
Avoid being overly protective.,
Let the person earn her rewards.",How to Deal With a Spoiled Brat," To effectively resolve an issue with a spoiled brat, you first need to take a deep breath and get control of your emotions. You may start to get angry or annoyed at this point, but it is key that you try to act like the reasonable, calm one in the situation. Doing this will allow you to effectively work through the conflict with the spoiled brat and not let your temper get in the way.Don’t take anything the spoiled brat says personally. Often, in the heat of the moment, hurtful things can be said. Your spoiled child may scream and yell “no” at you or a spoiled friend may publicly call you out and say hurtful things to you. Remember that the spoiled person is acting in a rage and out of her own self-interest. You end up being the punching bag she uses to try to get her way and what she is saying has nothing to do with you as a person.;
, If you feel you need time to get control of your emotions, do not be afraid to step away and take a timeout. A timeout can be really useful if you are feeling stressed, angry, or frustrated with the spoiled person.You may tell the person you are not emotionally ready to discuss the conflict and that you need some time to yourself. Or, you may instruct a spoiled child to stay in her room for ten to fifteen minutes while you take some time to process the conflict. Giving yourself time to check your emotions will allow you to deal better with the conflict.

, Avoid using shame or embarrassment as a discipline tactic, as this could only lead to more conflicts and issues in the future. Instead, try to set up a private meeting with the person to discuss her behavior or take your child into a private setting to talk her about the issue. This will allow you to have a one on one conversation with the person and teach her the consequences of her actions.For example, maybe the spoiled person talks to your partner rudely and calls them inappropriate names. You may then pull the person aside and explain that by doing that, she hurt your partner’s feelings and disrespected both you and your partner. You may then ask her to apologize for her behavior. Having a private discussion will allow you to let the person know that she did something wrong and resolve it together.

, You should try to present several options or ways to compromise when you address the conflict with the person. You should use specific suggestions and ways you can both work out the issue. But this does not mean you should negotiate or apologize to the person, as she is responsible for her own spoiled actions. Instead, you should offer several solutions to keep the conversation open and fair.For example, maybe your spoiled child decides not to eat her dinner. You may then present several solutions, such as having her eat at least five bites of her food or having her go to bed hungry. Chances are, she may take the first option as she may not like going to bed on an empty stomach.

, One way to avoid conflicts and issues when you are dealing with a spoiled brat is to make sure you have clear rules and boundaries in place. The spoiled brat should be aware of the rules and boundaries so she knows when she is overstepping them. This could be a simple rule, like always saying please and thank you after receiving something from someone, or always saying excuse when you sneeze. You should teach the spoiled brat that she must follow rules and boundaries laid out by you, as this will help you establish limitations around her behavior.You may establish table manner rules early on, such as saying “please” and “thank you”, no elbows on the table, chewing with your mouth closed, and excusing yourself from the table. Enforcing these manners can help the spoiled brat to remain calm and collected at the table.
You may have other rules for going out in public, like holding hands in a crowded area so she does not run off or ensuring she comes to you when her name is called. You may also teach her that there are consequences if she acts like a spoiled brat in public, as this could dissuade her from acting out.
If you are dealing with a spoiled adult, you should also be direct about your boundaries and limitations. You may let the person know you are not available to take her calls or messages every hour of the day and that you strive to maintain clear boundaries in your life. Being clear and direct can help to prevent issues in the future.

, You should have a set schedule of events and activities planned for your child so she knows what to expect and is not confused or thrown off. A change in her routine could lead to a temper tantrum and cause her to act out.You should try to follow the same daily routine for your child, such as waking her up at the same time every day and planning recreational activities on the same days of the week. You may also want to let her know in advance that there will be a change in her routine so she is not surprised or freaked out by it. She may be triggered by the change, regardless, but at least you can say you warned her before it occurs.

, It can be easy to ignore moments when your child is playing quietly on her own or getting along with her siblings in public and only focus on the moments when she is acting out. But you should go out of your way to acknowledge and reward any good behavior your “spoiled brat” displays.You may reward her with kind words, taking a moment to say to her, “I appreciate how you are playing well with your sisters”, or “You’re doing a great job staying quiet and calm”. You may also reward her by treating her to a special outing or a fun activity you can both do together.

, Instruct your child to use “I” statements to express her emotions and feelings so she can communicate clearly with you and others. Have her practice “I” statements with you and encourage to use “I” statements with she interacts with other adults and kids.If your child is not speaking yet, you can have her learn baby sign language to express herself. You may teach her to use a certain action to express what she wants, such as hunger, attention, or sleep.

, Though you should pick your battles with a spoiled brat and avoid responding every time she freaks out, you should also be willing to say “no”. You may try other tactics to distract her or get her focused on something else, but to no avail. If this is the case, you may need to be strict and tell her “no”. Do this firmly and clearly. Then, take away the item she is fighting you over or remove her from the space so she can cry it out in private., To make it less likely that your child will act like a spoiled brat, you should try to recognize any triggers she may have that can lead to bad behavior. Your child may be triggered by being around other children who act spoiled and disrespectful, or by being left alone in an unfamiliar space.Some triggers may be physical, such as hunger, where your child is over-tired and underfed. Your child may also have a medical condition, such as allergies, that can lead to grumpiness and a temper tantrum.

, Make sure your child gets enough sleep, and has snacks throughout the day so she is not hungry. You should also avoid areas or spaces that may trigger your child’s medical condition, as this could lead to a conflict or issue.You may also have your child observe and comment on her own behavior so she can learn how to resolve her own issues. This could encourage her to be more willing to address her own bad behaviors and get over being spoiled.
For example, you may point out that your child tends to come home from school after a bad day and take out her anger on her little brother. Ask your child, “What can you do instead of pick a fight with your brother?” Your child may then come up with her own solutions to the issue, such as “Maybe I can spend some time alone in my room drawing and listening to music.”

, Spoiled brats need to learn that their behavior has consequences. Being overly protective prevents them from growing and maturing. Everyone needs to learn how to handle difficult situations and take responsibility. Especially spoiled brats.Don’t rescue the person from every uncomfortable situation.
Allow the person to occasionally make mistakes.

, You can help teach a person patience and gratitude by allowing her to work towards specific goals and rewards by herself. You don’t have to offer encouragement or a reward for everything a person does. Getting the person everything she requests will only spoil the person.Only reward good behavior and don’t agree to every request your child makes.

Recognize why younger children lie.,
Accept that lying is a modifiable behavior.,
Praise truth-telling.,
Point out the differences between ""play-time"" and ""real life"".,
Teach the importance of honesty through stories.",How to Deal With a Lying Child1," In early childhood development, children have not been impacted and guided by the social mores of right and wrong, good and bad. A fibbing child at this age is doing so to either appease an adult, exaggerate a story to impress someone, or because they have forgotten something. The child may not even be aware that he has done anything wrong., Catching your child in a lie does not mean he is bound to be a sociopath. Lying is just one of many ways children explore the world and the reactions/expectations of others. Lying is learned through trial and error.For example, Matty told a lie that kept him from getting into trouble, so he learns that lying could protect him. His not getting into trouble reinforced the likelihood that he will get into trouble. However, anything learned can also be unlearned. Lying is no different.
Reinforcement goes both ways. Matty's lying was reinforced because he avoided trouble. On the contrary, a child telling the truth but still getting into trouble can actually be reinforced to lie in the future.

, How you respond to lying in the moment often determines whether your child will keep up the behavior. While you shouldn't overlook episodes of lying, try to avoid demonstrating anger or frustration with your young child. Doing so may inadvertently cause the behavior to continue. Instead, focus more on situations when you notice your child being truthful. Highlight the positives associated with being honest and congratulate your child on her honesty.Use words like ""awesome"", ""excellent"", or ""great job"" when praising your child for telling the truth. Always be clear about what you are praising your child for so that she knows which behaviors result in positive consequences.

, In some situations, your toddler or younger child may lie as an extension of their make-believe worlds. Children play all sorts of games, read stories, and watch TV shows that portray outstanding and remarkable circumstances. Being immersed in this make-believe world can cause your child to have a blurred understanding of reality.


Talk to your child about the differences between made-up stories and the truth. Clearly identify times when it is okay for your child to engage in imaginative storytelling and times when he or she must not. Be careful not to diminish the significance of imaginative play, as it is essential for creative and cognitive development., Use stories as a way to reinforce the benefits of being truthful. Most children's stories have a moral that can be discussed. Use your child's reading time to outline the significance of telling the truth by pointing out the consequences in different characters' lives for either lying or being honest and doing the right thing.

Listen and be patient with your teen.,
Ask your teen about her sleep schedule.,
Explain the value of following through on commitments and responsibilities.,
Check if there are other issues at home or at school.",How to Deal With a Lazy Teenager1," Avoid putting words in her mouth or interrupting her when she speaks. Encourage her to talk by asking casual questions about her day, or how a test went at school. Note her responses and allow her to share her thoughts.


Have a two way conversation. Showing your teen you care about her thoughts and opinions during a conversation will give her more confidence to be open and honest with you. Allow her to ask questions and let her think for herself.
An example conversation starter might be: ""How are things at school?"" ""How did practice go?"" ""Was the party fun on Saturday?""
Let your teen know you care about what's going on in their lives and you are there to listen. ""You know you can always talk to me if you're having trouble at school or you are feeling distracted."" ""I'm here to listen if you ever need to talk."" ""Remember, you can talk and I'll just listen."";
, Most teenagers may appear lazy or distracted, when in fact, they are often sleep deprived. Unlike adults, adolescents are actually biologically prone to sleeping in later and waking up in the mid morning, rather than in the early morning. So when your teen is forced out of bed at 7 or 8 am to go to school and learn, her natural sleep cycles is thrown off and she will likely appear lazy, disoriented, and unmotivated, all symptoms of lack of sleep. This is why it is so important that your teen goes to bed at a decent time to ensure she gets eight full hours of sleep a night. This will help to prevent appearing lazy, and ensure she has enough energy for the day.Discuss your teen's sleep patterns and her typical bed time. A consistent bed time every night, even on weekends, will help to set her natural sleep cycle and allow her body to get enough rest. For example, if she has to wake up at 7 am five days a week for school, she should be going to bed no later than 10:30 pm to ensure she gets a full eight hour sleep. She should then try to stick to this bedtime on weekends so she doesn't throw off her natural sleep cycle.

, Many teenagers drag their heels when asked to do chores or tasks because they don't see the value in doing these things. They may think, so what if I forget to take out the trash, or to clean my room? What does it matter? As a parent, its important for you explain that in fact you do not always want to do certain chores or tasks and would rather be doing other things with your time. But completing household chores and other life tasks is part of being a responsible member of the family.


Note that importance of teamwork and cooperation between everyone in the household to ensure chores and tasks are done equally in the home. Explaining to your teen that you often don't enjoy doing household duties, but you do them anyway for the good of everyone will help your teen understand the reasoning behind completing a chore or task. This will then motivate her to do her part as a member of the family.

, Laziness can sometimes be a symptom of other issues, like a lack of sleep, depression, stress, or other internal struggles. If your teen seems to be more sluggish or lazy than usual and is displaying other signs of depression or anxiety, sit down with your teen and talk with her.


If you are worried about your teen’s depression or anxiety, consider talking to a medical professional, your family doctor, or a counselor about next steps.

Make your expectations and boundaries very clear from the beginning.,
Explain the reasons behind rules and be a good role model.,
Be realistic.,
Help your children learn how to sort themselves out, thereby encouraging independence.,
Practise patience.This is something most adults need to do at some point too, not just children.,
Help your children learn how to put themselves in other people’s shoes through using ""restorative practices"".",How to Deal with Challenging Behaviour," Children can start understanding what your expectations are from as early as 18 to 20 months; you just need to be fair and take into account their age, abilities and understanding. Make sure that your expectations run along your family values or, if in the classroom, the school ethos. When children know how they are expected to behave, what the limits are, how far they can go, and so forth, they learn how to self-regulate and self-discipline themselves. Eventually they will reach the point when it is not necessary to remind them anymore how to behave. Here are a couple of examples of what parents can expect from their children:


If the school run starts at 8.30 am in your house, it is understandable to expect all the children to be ready at 8.20.
IF someone makes a mess, it is understandable to expect the person who made it to tidy up.;
, It is very important to make yourself understood and to share your expectations with your children in a way that makes sense to them. Children can understand the reasons behind rules from very early on, as long as your explanation matches their ability to understand; that is, making it simple and using age-appropriate language. Nobody likes to take orders just because, and children are no different. However, if they see there is a good reason why they must (or mustn’t) do something, they will be able to understand your demand and cooperate.


For example, if you say “don’t climb the fence!” they will very likely try to climb on it as soon as they get a chance. But if you explain that the fence is old, it may break and they may fall down and hurt themselves, they will understand you are just trying to protect them.

, If you can’t think of a good reason to ban something, maybe it shouldn’t be banned to start with. If you want your children to follow certain rules, you need to lead by example. Say, for instance, you want them to put their coats in the right place when they arrive home––then you need to put your coat in the right place too and not just throw it on the first chair you find. Children are wonderful imitators.

, Children love challenges that they can overcome, they love achieving. They show signs of independence before they can even walk; from crawling to tying their shoelaces, children love learning how to do things for themselves. Doing everything for them can be very frustrating for the child and can become a source of conflict. If you notice that your children, or pupils, want to have a go at something without help, it means it’s time to let them try. It will help them build a healthy self-esteem and they will be able to share their achievements with others.


Encourage and praise the children for trying hard (i.e. “You are a big boy now ! You can make your bed, well done!”).
Independence can also be encouraged during episodes of bad behaviour (starting when children are at least 4 or 5). If your children are fighting, or come to you complaining after a fight, you can offer them better help by asking how they are going to manage the situation, rather than yelling at them, getting angry or telling them yourself what to do.

, We live in a very fast-paced world and we expect everything to happen straight away, but when our little ones behave this way, we get stressed and tell them to be patient. If children learn to be patient, there will be less stress around the adult who often feels in a rush to fulfill all the wishes of the child. One of the best ways for a child to learn how to be patient is by seeing his parents, teachers and significant adults being patient too. Try to not rush them when completing a task, listen to them until they finish talking, don’t show anger when you are driving in front of them. These are all good examples of moments when you can show your children that you are a patient person.


Other ways to build up patience include: Turn taking games, toys that need building before they can be enjoyed (i.e., construction toys), puzzles or reading a long story over a few nights.

, Children are children and even the best behaved ones have their moments, and they will all show displays of bad behaviour because they have good and bad days, just as adults do. What to do when this happens? Shouting and punishing are counterproductive, for these reactions create a bad atmosphere and by resorting to such measures, you are just focusing on the negative feelings and emotions. ""Restorative practices"" (RP) are used in many schools nowadays;these practices allow teachers and children to sort out difficult situations in a peaceful way and, at the same time, they help the children to put themselves in other people’s shoes.


One of the main features of RP is the avoidance of “why?”. It is very hard for children to answer to why they have done something, they almost certainly don’t know. They felt frustrated, scared or humiliated and they reacted in an unacceptable way; it is kinder and more productive to ask “what happened?”. If you ask what happened, children will feel they are being given a chance to speak about what led to their bad behaviour.
The next step is talking about how they think they made you and others feel, depending on who is involved. In this way, they have time to reflect on what has happened and how it has affected others.
Another good question to ask them is if they would like to have that done to themselves. Very possibly the answer will be “no”.
The last thing is helping them to understand that they must take responsibility for their actions. Ask questions such as: “What are you going to do to put things right? Is saying sorry good enough? What else can you do?”. These questions will help the children to reflect on the consequences of their actions and the possible solutions. This is a very simple version of RP, aimed at little children. When children are a bit older you can get deeper with the questions and the conversation.

When you are notified by a school staff member that your child has misbehaved, and the school is going to administer a certain punishment, assure the staff member that you will support the school's punishment, and you will also will punish him/her at home.,
If your child is going to be suspended from school, you will almost certainly be required to come pick him/her up immediately at the school.,
If the child was suspended from school, punish them.,
If the staff member requests a meeting or conference to discuss the behavior, agree to attend one.,
Either after you pick up the child from the school, or when the child gets home from school, discuss with the child about the misbehavior seriously, but calmly, and try to find out why he/she did it.",How to Cooperate with a Child's Punishment from School,";
, This is a great opportunity to have a meeting/conference.

, Take away their privileges such as watching TV, using the computer (except for research and/or projects assigned), and going out with friends. This also applies when the child is suspended (out of school) and if there will be a break between suspension days such as weekends, holidays, and school closures. If unsure, see how to punish your child when they're suspended.

, If a meeting or conference isn't requested, and you feel it would be beneficial to find out the specifics of the offense, take it upon yourself to request one. You can also discuss it with a teacher or principal over the phone.

, Make it clear to the child that misbehavior at school will not be tolerated.

Examine the rationale behind lying at this age.,
Refrain from labeling your child as a ""liar"".,
Don't walk your child into a lie.,
Model honesty.,
Set better boundaries.,
Beware when lying is a sign of a bigger issue.",How to Deal With a Lying Child2," In the middle years of childhood, kids lie to protect themselves (or a friend or sibling) from getting into trouble or to prevent you from being angry or disappointed. Kids want everyone to be calm and happy (including themselves), and, if lying suits this purpose, then they'll do it., One of the worst things you can do as a parent is label a child by an offensive behavior. It is the behavior (i.e. lying) that you do not like, but labeling can make it seem as if the child is the problem. Even if you have noticed a consistent pattern of lying in your child, avoid saying the ""L"" word.


Instead, exercise the belief that your child can be honest. Kids should know that you have confidence in their truth-telling abilities, and that you see them as brave or courageous when they are honest - even when telling the truth is scary or hard.

, Sometimes, adults make the error of putting children into tight situations in which they are tempted to lie. For example, you walk into the living room and see a huge mess on the floor. You have three children. Asking ""who made this mess?"" in an upsetting tone only pushes each of your children to either lie about not having done it or blame it on someone else.Recognize that being honest requires a great deal of courage, especially when the consequence of telling the truth is facing a red-faced, angry adult who is capable of inflicting punishment.
Rather than putting your kids in a corner, simply verbalize your expectations. Say, ""the living room isn't a storage space for toys, book bags, or clothes. I need it to be tidy in 20 minutes.""

, Acknowledge how your behavior affects your child's lying. This is not to say that if your child lies, it's your fault. However, parents must understand the old saying that what you do in moderation, your child does in excess. If your child has witnessed you telling little ""white lies"" or lying to get out of something, then they will see this behavior as acceptable - even if you warn them against it. In order to prevent this, portray honesty in your everyday actions as much as possible. Of course, there are some circumstances in which lying is done to protect someone else's feelings. Younger children usually cannot discriminate between these situations. So, as a rule of thumb, be truthful in your interactions with your children and others.

, Unlike younger children, kids over 5 typically know when they are lying, which means they know the difference between right and wrong. If they tell a lie to get themselves or someone else out of trouble, then they are already aware of their wrongdoing. Therefore, lecturing to them or going on and on about what they've done is not necessary. What is necessary is helping them to overcome the temptation to be disobedient. Boundary-setting can help alleviate this problem.It is virtually impossible for adults to remove all opportunities for children to misbehave. However, you can minimize these opportunities by setting boundaries in your household and beyond. Look for ways to remove temptations to be disobedient and boost their chances of doing the right thing.
For example, getting upset because your 7-year-old ate an entire bag of candy could have been prevented if the candy was not accessible in the first place. It is a fact that most children like candy. Leaving it in plain sight challenges your child's self-control. To overcome this issue, remove the temptation by putting candy away out of your child's reach. Increase the likelihood of your child making good choices by making healthy snacks more accessible.

, Childhood lying can point to a serious problem in some kids. Mental illnesses like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and even personality disorders may manifest through lying. Closely monitor your child's lying. If it seems like your child is lying for no reason, constantly testing adult limits, or lying without remorse, you may need to see a child psychologist.In addition, childhood lying accompanied by bullying, terrorizing or hurting animals, or destroying one's own or another's possessions may signal a more complex issue that requires professional assistance to address.

Evaluate your adolescent's goals for lying.,
Ask your child why they choose to lie and listen.,
Evaluate your role in adolescent lying.,
Avoid arguing back and forth.,
Follow through on punishments.",How to Deal With a Lying Child3," By this age, lying is certainly a conscious behavior. Older children and adolescents know the difference between truth and fantasy. They are aware of the consequences of telling lies, and, unfortunately, they have also gotten much more skilled at lying. Adolescents lie to avoid punishment, to get out of doing undesirable activities, to hide unacceptable behaviors, to protect their privacy, and to protect other's feelings., Lecturing is generally futile with adolescents. For the most part, they understand right and wrong and the potential consequences of their actions. Therefore, you may not need to reiterate why what they did was wrong. However, asking your adolescent son or daughter why they chose to lie might clue you into a deeper rationale, or highlight places where boundaries need to be set.Adolescents are exercising independence and evolving in their identities. They are also fiercely loyal and protective of their friends and peers. If your son lies about a friend who's mom is an alcoholic, he may be doing so to not only maintain confidentiality of his friend's situation, but also making sure you don't try to cut off their seeing one another in a time when his friend really needs support.
After you ask their rationale avoid any blaming or finger-pointing. Sit quietly and listen to understand their point-of-view.

, Are you extremely strict? Are you not allowing your maturing child to have independence appropriate to his or her age? Consider this scenario: your 15-year-old daughter is lying about wearing makeup to school. You find out from a friend who's a teacher and immediately fly off the handle when she comes home one day. Your reaction itself is enough to encourage more lying - your child fears your disapproval, so she hides her behavior from you.This example is not placing fault in your parenting, but rather allowing for the fact that with older children you should open up the door for a dialogue. If your response is to naturally say ""no"", to stamp out negotiations or to not let your children have any voice, then lying or covering up is expected.
Aim to pick your battles with your lying child so that he or she feels capable of opening up a dialogue with you. Decide which issues are non-negotiable and allow your maturing teen some input in the decision-making on issues that are more flexible. Of course, the final say should always be left up to the parents, particularly in cases involving safety. However, more effective collaboration may help to eliminate your child's lying habit.It may be necessary to visit with a family therapist if you are having trouble releasing the reigns on your growing adolescent child. A professional can help you set boundaries, but also assist your entire family in improving communication.

, State the obvious and explain the consequences. If you have caught your adolescent child in a lie, there is no need to go on and on about the details, or ask clarifying questions that only result in your child telling more lies. Be upfront with your child by saying, ""I know you lied about ____"". If you want to understand their lie, then ask. Otherwise, tell your child the consequences of lying and carry on.

, If you (and your partner or spouse) determine that your child's lying requires consequences, be sure to carry them out. Not following through on punishments, or presenting ""empty threats"", can undermine your authority and cause your child to think he or she can get away with inappropriate behavior. That's why you should always give yourself space to ponder over - and maybe discuss with someone else - your child's behavior before dolling out punishments, so you can be sure the punishment is reasonable based on the infraction.Strive to enforce logical consequences to your child's lying. In other words, make sure the punishment fits the crime. For example, if your adolescent son lied and said he was watching a younger sibling, but the sibling was injured because your son was actually distracted by TV, an appropriate consequence would be to take away TV privileges."

Make a chore schedule.,
Limit your teen’s video game and computer use.,
Follow through on consequences for negative behavior.,
Don’t lose your temper or take negative comments to heart.",How to Deal With a Lazy Teenager2," Assigning chores to your teen will teach her responsibility and help her practice following through on commitments. Chores will also force your teen to get off the couch and get things done. Create a schedule that breaks down the duties around the house by day and assign each task to your teen and/or others in the home, including:Cleaning her bedroom
Cleaning the bathroom
Doing laundry
Dusting and cleaning the common areas
Sweeping or mopping the floors

, Most teens are easily distracted and reduced to lethargy by their computer, their smartphone, or the latest video game. Rather than cut off your teen completely, which could lead to fighting or a conflict, place specific time limits on these distractions, such as no smart phones at the dinner table during dinner or no video gaming after 10 pm. This will allow your teen to focus her time and energy on her school assignments or her chores. It will also ensure she is not up all night on the computer and can be well rested for a productive day.When setting limits for your teen, it’s important that you also set a good example by also following the same rules. Don’t bring your phone to the table during dinner if your teen is not allowed to have her phone with her during dinner, and try to also limit your watching television or gaming to no later than 10 pm. This will show your teen you can also abide by the same rules you have established for her.

, If your teen argues against doing her chores or does not follow any of your limitations, be firm and clear about the consequences. This can range from less severe punishments like no going out for the night to more severe punishments like a reduction on her allowance, no television or computer use for a week, or grounding her for a period of time.


As the adult in the relationship, you must enforce the rules that you set and dole out consequences for disobeying the rules. Your teen may get upset or angry, but she will understand the consequences of her actions and likely think twice about disobeying a rule or neglecting a chore again.
Try not to over react and give your teen the most severe punishment for small arguments or conflicts. Match the scale of the your teen’s wrongdoing with the level of punishment she will receive.

, Your teen will likely resist your initial attempts to set rules and assign chores, so be prepared for some arguing and talking back. Avoid losing your temper and screaming at your teen. Instead, focus on responding calmly and being positive about the situation. Your teen is more likely to respond to a controlled parent than an angry one.


Rather than take away her phone or computer when she doesn’t listen to you, another option is to simply ask her to do a task and then stand there and watch her until she puts down the distraction and completes the task. Your teen may see you are unreasonable or annoying, but she will soon realize you will not stop watching her until she stops being lazy. This type of motivation will work better than nagging or yelling at your teen."

Analyze how your teen spends her time.,
Use a reward system.,
Hire your teen for household jobs.,
Encourage your teen to try extracurricular activities or sports.,
Volunteer with your teen.,
Congratulate your teen for any accomplishments or achievements.",How to Deal With a Lazy Teenager3," Observe how your teen seems to be acting lazy or wasting time. Does she spend all day on her computer? Does she opt to read a book instead of do her chores? Maybe she spends most of her time on her phone, talking to friends, and neglecting her chores or responsibilities. Before you can provide adequate motivation for your teen, you need to determine how she is being lazy. This will help you understand her current way of thinking and spot any patterns of laziness.

, Once you observe your teen’s lazy behavior, you can use these patterns of laziness to create a custom reward system. For example, your teen may like to spend a lot of time texting on her phone. You can then tell her before she can text on her phone, she has to complete her chores for the day. She will then see texting on her phone as a privilege and part of her reward for doing her chores. Or, if your teen tends to spend a lot of time in front of her computer, limit her computer use until she has set the table for dinner or cleaned her room.


Be specific about the tasks you use as rewards, as this will feel more immediate to your teen and motivate her to get things done. Tailor the rewards to the preferences of your teen, as she will feel the reward that much more if it something she is interested in.

, Most teens are looking to earn a little extra cash, especially if they do not receive an allowance from their parents. Provide opportunities for your teen to earn some side money by hiring her to complete special projects around the house or in the neighborhood. This will also help get your teen off the couch and on to doing something productive.You could hire your teen to paint a wall that needs a touch up, or to organize the garage or the basement. Give your teen a job outdoors, like pulling weeds or trimming the hedges, to get her outside and away from any distractions.

, Consider your teen’s skill set, such as a flare for drama, an interest in basketball, or a budding passion for computer science, and encourage her to participate in a school play, join the basketball team at school, or join a computer science club. This will get your teen to spend time on an activity she enjoys and motivate her to develop her talents and skills.

, Another way to set a good example is to spend time with your teen by volunteering together for a good cause. Think of an activity that you and your teen can do together that will allow you both to give back to the community and avoid laziness.


This could be as simple as spending a few hours at the local soup kitchen, or spending a day as volunteers at a local festival. You could also both donate time to a charity drive or a food drive.

, Once your teen demonstrates her motivation by winning an award or accomplishing a high score on a test, compliment her. This will show you appreciate her hard work and value her productivity.


Though you may want to give your teen a monetary reward like extra allowance or more time allowed on the computer, kind words of encouragement can be a reward in itself for a teenager.

Define your goals and rules clearly.,
Consider the advice of other experienced caregivers.,
Relay your expectations to everyone involved in childcare.,
Role-play scenarios to ensure that everyone’s on the same page.,
Communicate these rules to the child.,
Choose age-appropriate consequences.,
Be consistent with the rules.,
Don’t give in to challenges to your authority.,
Use “if-then” language with your child.,
Check in often with other caregivers.,
Be flexible when it counts.,
Revise disciplining goals and rules as children develop.,
Select new caregivers if others are inconsistent.",How to Coordinate Discipline Among Caregivers," Work with your partner to come up with a list of goals and expectations for your child, and define the rules you will enforce to achieve these goals. It’s a good idea to set goals in three distinct areas: long-term goals for the kind of character you want your child to develop, short-term goals for current behavioral issues your child is experiencing, and specific rules you plan to implement.Invite older children to take part in setting goals and coming up with rules. When kids feel like their input is valued, they are more likely to follow rules and take responsibility for their behavior.Put your goals and rules in writing so they are clear, concrete, and easy to review or revise.;
, While you don’t have to take every suggestion offered by other people, it can be helpful to listen to the opinions of your child’s other caregivers. People who are experienced in childcare may have good ideas for rule-setting or for enforcing consequences of misbehavior., Create a written list of your expectations for your child, the rules they must follow, and the consequences for breaking those rules. Make sure that grandparents, babysitters, daycare workers, and other caregivers have a copy of your rules, and encourage them to ask questions about anything that isn’t clear.Start the conversation with something like, “We have set some new rules and we wanted to make sure everyone is on board.”

, Good communication is essential between parents and caregivers. By acting out or talking through scenarios before they happen, you can ensure caregivers understand how you want them to handle these situations. Rehearsing or repeating rules makes them easier to remember and enforce.For example, tell the other caregivers, “If we have put them in time out and they try to convince you to let them play video games, simply say ‘Video games are off-limits during time out’ and don’t engage further.”

, Explain your rules clearly, and make sure your child knows why each rule is in place. Encourage your child to discuss the rules with you and ask questions about anything they don’t understand.When you talk about rules with your child, make sure you’re having a conversation, not delivering a lecture. While children need to know that you’re in charge, they are also more likely to cooperate if they feel listened to and respected.
Say, “We wanted to talk to you about the rules… Do you have any questions?”

, A consequence is not a punishment — it’s something that naturally unfolds from your child’s actions. Unlike a punishment, which may seem unrelated to your child’s behavior, a consequence follows the rule of cause and effect. Consequences give your child a sense of responsibility for his or her own actions and decisions.For instance, if your toddler refuses to pick up his toys, you might put the toys in time-out for a day until he is able to accept the responsibility of cleaning up. If an older child’s grades drop because she’s been playing too many online games, you could take away her computer privileges until she brings her grades back up.
Be sure to establish boundaries early. Often parents make mistakes by thinking as a toddler, their children are too young for limitations, but this is not so.
The limitations you set and the ability for the child to follow them will depend on their age and ability to understand. For toddlers, too many rules can be overwhelming. Focus on two or three of the most important rules at any one time. Once the child understands a rule and is following it, you can introduce a new rule.

, Kids need regularity and stability in their lives. Although they may try to test the rules, the consistency of a clear set of expectations is actually reassuring to them.


Staying consistent with the rules might be difficult for you sometimes, especially if you’re busy, distracted, or tired, but stick with it — if you only enforce the rules some of the time, your child will get the message that they don’t really have to follow them., Even the most well-behaved children will try to test your boundaries at some point. Though it might be difficult to handle this situation firmly and calmly every time it arises, it’s important to stand your ground so your child doesn’t get the message that they can manipulate or nag you into bending the rules.Sometimes young kids challenge authority because they simple forget. Keep in mind that not all challenges to authority in younger kids are because they are testing limits.
Avoid raising your voice, even when your child is acting in a frustrating way. Yelling indicates that you aren’t in control of the situation.
When your child challenges you, often it’s best to dismiss the challenge entirely. For instance, if your 10-year-old refuses to clean her room, don’t give her a choice. Instead, ask “Would you rather clean your room up now or after soccer practice?” Do not negotiate.

, Make it clear what the consequences for certain behaviors will be, and make sure you follow through every time. This strategy will make your child take you seriously when you tell them to do something, and it will reinforce the idea that you can be relied on.You might say something like, “If you don’t finish your homework again tonight, then you will not be able to play any more video games until you show me you can get your homework done.”
Failure to follow through will teach your children that you don’t always mean what you say, so make sure to only set consequences you’re prepared to enforce., Communicating often with the other people who care for your child can help keep you all on the same page regarding expectations and rules. Don’t feel shy about dropping in on your babysitter or daycare provider unannounced now and then — this is a good way to see how well caregivers follow your instructions when you’re not around.Check in by saying “I wanted to see how things are going since we’ve put those new rules in place…”

, On special occasions or days your child is out of their routine for some reason, you might allow them to skip their regular chores or do them at a different time. You might also decide to reward good behavior or good grades with an out-of-the-ordinary treat. When you bend a rule, make sure your child understands why, and make it clear that this is an exception, not something to expect regularly.Staying flexible means picking your battles wisely. It probably won’t be possible to enforce all of your rules all of the time, so decide which ones you’re willing to compromise on and which you aren’t.

, Your child will have different behavioral issues at age eight than they did at five, and they will need a different set of guidelines to follow. Adapt your goals and revise your list of rules as your child develops.


As children get older, they also become better able to provide insight and suggestions on their schedules and limitations, so take their thoughts into consideration when you update your rules., Though it can be difficult to let a caregiver go, sometimes it’s essential for your child’s well-being and your peace of mind. If your caregiver consistently fails to follow your instructions or disciplines your child in a way you find unacceptable, it’s best to end the relationship and find another caregiver who follows your instructions better.If the inconsistent caregiver is a relative, consider visiting them at times when you can be around too, instead of leaving your child in their care.

Set reasonable behavioral expectations.,
Stay calm during a tantrum.,
Practice active listening.,
Reward good behavior.,
Make a plan and stick to it.,
Set privileges that can be taken away.,
Use timeouts.,
Don’t use violence.,
Know the signs of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD).,
Know the signs of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).,
Know the signs of trauma.",How to Deal With a Defiant Child," You should set expectations for your child’s behavior that are both consistent and clearly communicated. However, when you develop these expectations, consider your child’s behavioral skills and abilities at their age. For example, it may not be reasonable to ask your 8-year old to stay seated and quiet for several hours at a time. If you impose expectations for maturity that are beyond the child’s capacity, you set your rules up for failure.Recognize that the part of your child’s brain that controls impulses and emotions is constantly developing, even into adulthood.Ask yourself honestly what rules your child is capable of following so you are prepared to deal with the inevitable behavioral transgressions.
If your child has demonstrated that they are able to comply with certain behavioral expectations but does not do so consistently, this is likely an act of intentional defiance. Recognize these situations and impose discipline appropriately.
Take time to explain your expectations to your child, free from other distractions like television or toys. You may even want to write them down and post them somewhere in house as teachers often do in elementary classrooms.;
, Children throwing tantrums are often trying to provoke a reaction. Yelling, threatening, pleading with them to stop, or simply giving into their demands may or may not stop the tantrum in the short term but will not teach them to behavior maturely. Set an example by staying calm and staying firm on your position. Your child may continue their tantrum for a time but will likely eventually recognize that they are not getting their desired reaction, tire themselves out, and find more mature ways to get your attention in the future.Understand that tantrums are a natural childhood reaction to feelings of powerlessness. While your child will have to learn to deal with situations where they are not in control, you may be able to alleviate these situations by giving them a small amount of control.The best way to give your child a manageable amount of personal freedom is to give them acceptable options rather than imposing a single option. For example, if your child expresses a desire to dress themselves, lay out 2 or 3 acceptable clothing options and let them chose. You can do the same for meal options and recreational activities, among other things.
If the tantrum occurs in public and you find it urgent to diffuse the situation, have a backup plan for pacifying them, such as giving them a lollipop or agreeing to do something they like later. It is not good to give in consistently so if you find their public behavior consistently problematic, arrange for homecare when you need to attend a public gathering., Children often feel powerless and unheard, leading to tantrums and defiant behavior. Let your child express themselves and react without judgment or evaluation. Instead, recognize the point they are making and repeat it back to them to express that you respect their feelings and are trying to genuinely understand them. This will not only demonstrate empathetic maturity to them but make it more likely that they will respect and understand your response.If, for example, your child does not want to go to school, instead of insisting or trying to convince them they do want to, ask them why, acknowledge their concerns, and try to suggest ways they can cope with them. After you’ve acknowledged their feelings, then express why they have to attend in simple and honest terms.
Accepting your child’s feelings is not the same as agreeing or caving to them. Active listening is about demonstrating maturity and empathy so your child learns by example.

, Providing a clear incentive for good behavior is just as important as deterring bad behavior. When your child does comply with your commands, you should, at a minimum, express gratitude and admiration for their good behavior. Better yet, provide small rewards like extra playtime, extra television time, or their favorite snack., Think of reasonable punishments for specific problematic behaviors before you are confronted with defiance. This will remove emotion from your discipline and prevent you from seeming arbitrary. The more consistently your rules are applied, the more likely your child will adapt to them., Offer your child a consistent privilege, such as the ability to buy a new toy every week or a set amount of internet time per day. Clearly articulate that these are privileges, not rights, and that they will be taken away when they act defiantly.Set a time limit for the removal of privileges, such as no internet for one week. It’s important to express that the privilege needs to be earned back and if the defiant behavior continues, the timespan of the punishment will increase.

, For more severe bad behavior, use timeouts. Studies show that timeouts are the most effective form of negative reinforcement and can serve as an effective deterrent for intentional defiance when administered properly.Give your child a warning first and then a timeout if the bad behavior persists.
Send your child to a room with no television, games or internet. Forcing them to stand in a corner or facing a wall can be used as an escalating factor if your initial timeouts aren’t working.If your child is under that age of 6, start by sitting with them during the timeouts and performing a positive activity like reading a book or doing a puzzle together. This will help them adjust to the idea of a cool-down period after a tantrum., Spanking, slapping, or any other physical is more likely to develop hostility than correct the behavior of a defiant child. Even when done with mild force, physical discipline is strongly linked with childhood aggression, anti-social behavior, and mental health problems later in life., If your child’s defiance is extreme and persistent, they may have Oppositional Defiant Disorder. You will need a diagnosis from a psychiatrist to confirm this and clinical talk therapy to treat it.The classic symptoms of ODD include consistently irritable mood, an extreme tendency toward argumentativeness, impulsivity, vindictiveness, and significant behavioral problems at school. ODD is often accompanied by antisocial behavior and self-harm.
The symptoms of ODD generally begin to show before the age of 8. The symptoms should persist for a least six months before a diagnosis can be made., ADD and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) are increasingly common diagnoses for children with persistent behavioral problems. You will need a diagnosis from a psychiatrist to confirm this. There are a host of cognitive and talk therapies designed to treat ADD/ADHD as well as stimulate medications like Ritalin and Adderall.ADD is typified by a persistent inability to stay focused. It can also be accompanied by hyperactivity, absent-mindedness, forgetfulness, mood swings, anxiety, and depression. These characteristics are common

, Persistent defiance can be a sign of traumatic stress in children. The cause of trauma can be physical like abuse, bullying, or experiencing a car crash or more emotional like going through a parental divorce or the death of a family member. If your child is expressing bad behavior because of traumatic stress, you will likely need to see a therapist for more information about causes and treatment.A sharp change in behavior and mood after a potentially traumatic event is an obvious sign that it is linked to the event. Anti-social behavior, mood swings, and a loss of cognitive skills problem-solving are also warning signs that bad behavior is linked to trauma.

Ask your child why they will not eat.,
If they do not have a legitimate answer, talk to your child on the importance of nutrition.,
Organise ground rules, they want to leave the table A.S.A.P and do stuff, you want them to finish their meal, make sure both you and your child know where you stand.

,
Get them involved in cooking, if they can decorate their own food with pastry or cheese slices cut into shapes, or just placing the food and sauces to make funny faces it's far more interesting for them.

,
Make dishes they like occasionally as a treat - they might like burgers and chips/french fries, but a tasty healthy burger with oven baked seasoned wedges goes down just as well and can be healthy.

,
Avoid any double standards yourself.,
On some children it works well to get personalized cutlery, plates etc.,

, Tell them how eating healthy dinners will help them to grow up healthy. Tell them that, when they eat dinner, they will have more energy to play.

,,,, If you don't finish the meal as the parent, then the kids think its fine to do the same. As the adult, kids will always see it from the angle that you should know better.

, They might like a certain colour, pattern, or something that shows their TV hero. Get a set per child, plus a spare in case it goes missing. They can be quite cheap to find from large discount stores.

, You are the parent, but aim for a healthy balance.

, Turn off the TVs and get the toys out of sight. There is a trade off however, the more boring a meal is, the more likely they will want to leave. Playing soft music in the background can be a good alternative.

, Have everyone eat together as a family. This can make dinner time a better experience for your child if they are with loved ones.

, Even if they sit eating in a games room away from the table (and this should be considered as a big treat), healthy food still gets eaten if you serve it. That way if the group eats nothing, it may show that not eating is a peer pressure problem.

, But only if they eat their dinner with out a fight. Do not give in and give them the treat anyway if they complain.

, You can also serve bread and meat and allow them to make their own open sandwiches. This gets a serve of fruits and veggies in without it looking like a healthy meal.

, It's no fun sitting there if the rest of the family has eaten their food and is back to playing.

Have a plan in place for the issues you can anticipate for each age. While you cannot predict all behavior problems, you know you will have to deal with a toddler who won't listen, a school-aged child who does not want to do homework and a teenager who wants to stay out late. Be prepared.;
, You and your spouse lead busy lives and juggle work, parenting and other responsibilities. Dedicate some time to discussing the discipline of your child or children.

, Never argue about your parenting roles in front of your kids. Your communication should be kept between you and your spouse. You do not want to encourage your kids to choose sides or use what they hear against you.


Try having a signal with one another if you feel like a discussion might escalate into an argument. This will keep your tempers in check and avoid a fight that will have a negative impact on your kids.

, This will give you each some perspective if you are approaching child discipline differently.


Let your spouse know how you were disciplined as a child, and whether you think it was fair and appropriate. Some people want to copy their parents' style, and others want to do the exact opposite.

, Talk to your spouse about how you expect your children to behave, and what the consequences should be when they misbehave.


Be sure to share these expectations and rules with your children. Both parents should be involved in talking to the kids about how they are expected to behave and how they will be disciplined.

, Talk about these methods with your spouse.


Discuss the authoritarian style of rigid rules and harsh punishments. Children are not involved in decision-making and are expected to demonstrate respect for their parents.
Talk about the authoritative style of discipline, which considers input from the children but does not necessarily follow it. Explanations are offered and discipline is often handed out on a case-by-case basis.
Debate the over-protective approach to discipline, in which children are sheltered and protected from anything or anyone that could possibly harm them.
Consider laissez-faire discipline, which provides few rules and restrictions and offers little concrete guidance or punishment.

, You and your spouse can take advantage of available books, websites, magazines, classes and support groups that help parents navigate the paths of child discipline.


Discuss everything you read, learn and see.

, If you are working with a blended family, there will be different expectations when it comes to disciplining each other's children.


Talk frequently with each other about boundaries, problems, successes and any resentment that might arise when a stepparent disciplines a child that is not biologically his or hers.

Take time for yourself.Everyone needs a little downtime.",How to Calm an Upset or Angry Child," This is an important step if it's not obvious why the child is upset. Even if you do know, it can be useful for them to articulate their experience in their own words. Expressing themselves can help them process their emotions and develop emotional awareness.


Naming and discussing their emotions will help them recognize them more clearly in the future.
For young children who cannot communicate their feelings, parents can state or reflect how the child is feeling: ""You look upset."" ""You seem frustrated."" ""So your feelings are hurt."" The child can then respond by either affirming or denying the reflected emotions. In this way, parents are teaching the child to identify and correctly label emotions and the child is recognizing and labeling his/her emotions.;
, It's important to mirror the child, especially early on in their life. Acknowledging the child's emotions will help them develop a confident sense of self-esteem.For example, if your son/daughter is angry, you can say ""I can see that you're angry right now. I know what it's like to feel angry. It's okay to feel angry.""
If they are too young to describe their experience, even just being there with them and paying attention to what they're doing can be a powerful form of mirroring.

, Listening to the child is one of the best ways to get them to listen to you back.It will also help them feel understood and appreciated. Follow these steps to be a good listener:


Be available. Establish an open relationship where they can talk to you whenever they feel the need. This could be as simple as encouraging them when they tell you about their lives.
Reflect what they say. When they tell you about how they feel, rephrase it and ask if you got it right.
Avoid jumping to conclusions. If you catch the child doing something wrong, allow them to explain themselves before you respond. Ask questions about their reasoning and try to understand.

, You want to acknowledge the child's feelings, but that doesn't mean that they need to rule you. It's important to be consistent and firm in response to the child's high emotions.


This will give them a sense of stability and order in a sometimes-scary world., When you set a boundary or prevent the child from doing something, it's a good practice to explain to them why you're doing what you're doing. This will set them up to model good decision making and also create a more respectful environment between the two of you.Involving them in the decision-making process is a good way to introduce them to personal responsibility and clear thinking. Make sure to tailor this to their age and to the situation at hand.Keep the ""final say"" in your own court, though. Authoritative parenting is generally the best approach. This kind of parenting involves some flexibility without giving away too much power., Then they can recognize when they're getting upset. These can be expressed verbally or through physical actions. Here are a few to watch out for:


Clenched fists
Tension or holding themselves tightly
Angry facial expressions
Stomping
Verbal outbursts such as yelling and cursing

, Here's a list of some basic needs that most children require:


Physical needs such as not being hungry, cold, or tired.
Attention. Children need attention from caregivers and people around them. Read them a book or play games together.
Stimulation. Children need novel stimulation in order to thrive. New toys, friends, and activities can help them avoid emotional problems.
Feeling safe and security. If your home is chaotic, they may act out because of feeling insecure.

, Do something that makes the child laugh. Just make sure they don't think you're laughing at them, and also make sure it's an appropriate time to lighten the mood (not, for example, in the middle of a big argument). Here are some things you can do:


Tell a joke.
Watch a funny TV show or read a funny book together.
Make funny faces. This is most effective with younger children.

, Touch is known to calm nerves, especially if it's coming from a loving, trusted source. Hugging and embracing release oxytocin in the body, which is the ""bonding hormone."" This hormone reduces stress levels and increases positive feelings.If a child is upset and overwhelmed, offer plenty of touch in order to help them recover and show him that you're a trustworthy source of comfort.


Don't restrain the child, even accidentally. This can increase their feelings of powerlessness, and teach them that they need someone else to control their behavior.

, Stressful situations can reduce anyone to an emotional mess, adults as well as children. Sometimes the most effective approach is to remove the child from the distress. For example, if they throw a tantrum over wanting something in a store, exit the store as quickly as possible. You can deal with the behavior afterward; your first step should be to reduce the intensity of the situation, if possible. This will make it easier for everyone involved.

, It's not out of the ordinary for kids to use physical aggression to try and get what they want. If a child tends to act out physically, try to get them to channel their energy into other ways of expressing themselves. Reward them when they tell you what's wrong or draw an angry picture rather than becoming violent.Lashing out physically is a form of communication that some children learn can be effective. Make sure not to reinforce the behavior by giving in to their demands or allowing them to be violent without consequences.


Don't forget to keep your own safety in mind. Pacify a violent child if you can. Take steps to prevent injury. If they attack if you get close, then don't get in their personal space. Wait until they are calm enough to be approached.
Absolutely avoid responding with physical aggression of your own. This will teach them that it's an effective way to communicate and get what they want.
Contact a therapist who specializes in treating children if physical aggression is a common event and is violent.

, Pay specific attention to ""trouble times"" with the child, such as right before bed or when they need to do homework. Be extra sensitive and aware of the child's feelings in these moments. You don't need to make excuses for them, but it's helpful to be aware of these higher stress times.


Prepare in advance if the child regularly has issues handling a particular behavior. Create a game-plan for how to react so that you can avoid spur of the moment decisions.

, You can't always avoid punishment, but if possible, wait for your child to do something right and then encourage that behavior. Here are some ways you can reward good behavior:


Use nonverbal communication. Head nods, smiles, and hugs are an effective way to reinforce behavior and better the relationship without needing to spend money.
Provide extra positive attention.
Be specific with verbal praise. If the child does well on a test, tell them ""I'm proud of you for working hard on this test.""

, It's a great idea to show your child how to calm themselves down during moments of anger and being upset. These skills will make things easier for you and teach them to manage their emotions early, so that they are less likely to develop emotional problems later on in life. Here are some suggestions for things to teach:


Apply deep pressure. This could mean asking for a back rub from a loved one, giving themselves a hand massage, wrapping themselves tightly in a blanket, or using a weighted lap pad or blanket.
Offer drawing, painting, or coloring materials. This can help them focus on something other than being upset while also giving them an outlet for their emotions.
Show him the same deep breathing techniques that you use. You can make it playful by exaggerating the bodily movements.
Provide a calming item or favorite stuffed animal that they can touch or hug when upset. If they are scared to be away from home, you can provide a small reminder of safety that they can carry in their pocket, and they can can touch or look at when feeling sad or anxious.

, One of the first and most important steps to calming a child is to stay calm yourself. It will be much harder to keep the child calm if you are upset. Children look to you to see how they should act. If you react strongly, so will they. Watch out for particularly harmful behaviors like yelling and screaming. This will teach the child that raising your voice is an effective way to deal with emotions and communicate with other people., When things get hectic, don't forget to breathe. Take a step back from the chaos and inhale deeply. It may be helpful to count your breaths or focus on the sensation of the air going in and out of your nostrils.Simple actions like these can make it easier to deal with a stressful situation.

, Children don't act out or get upset without a reason. That reason could be anything from hunger to not getting to go somewhere with friends. Understanding the why will help you keep yourself in check; you'll be able to create a plan for action for the future and feel less confused.


It can be helpful to wait until the crisis is over before you start reflecting. Keep yourself present to his feelings.

, If you start to feel overwhelmed, or that you are losing your cool, ask your spouse or someone you trust to give you a hand. Maybe you need help making breakfast while someone else gets the kids ready. Whatever it is, don't be ashamed to reach out.


Accept that help won't always be perfect. Sometimes imperfect help is better than no help. For example, if you're worried that your spouse may feed your daughter junk food, think of that as an acceptable compromise for a moment of peace., If you feel the pressures of parenting or taking care of a child well up, try to schedule a night to yourself. Hire a baby-sitter or ask a friend to watch the kids for a few hours. Some things you can do to recharge:


Go on a date. This can be with your spouse or someone new if you're single.
See a movie with friends.
Go to a spa. Treat yourself to some relaxation and self-care.

Give them a five minute warning.,

Start a countdown.,

Get going.",How to Avoid Tantrums at Playtime," Let your kid know that it is time to go in exactly five minutes. You can also raise your hand to motion ""five"" with your fingers.
, Remind them once a minute that you will be leaving soon. During this time, make sure that your kid understands the departure by looking at you instead of just hearing what you're saying., Let your kid finish the activity they are doing and then tell them it's time's up. Because of all the warnings, your kid won't be surprised playtime is over and should come quietly."

Model good manners.,
Apologize when you mess up.,
Ask for your child’s help with daily tasks.,
Choose your priorities.,
Be obvious.,
Practice good self-care.,
Address the feelings that parenting evokes for you.,
Model healthy eating and drinking.,
Pursue your own goals.,
Praise good behavior and positive changes.,
Role play good behavior.,
Stay calm before reacting to your child’s bad behavior.,
Avoid physical violence.",How to Behave So Your Children Will Too," Use the words you would like your child to use. Let your child hear you say things like “please,” “thank you,” and “excuse me” in your interactions with him/her and with the other adults and children in your life. This is more effective than prompting your child to say “the magic word” in order to receive something.


Watch your own language around your children. If they hear you using swear words or coarse language, they will learn to speak that way, too.;
, It’s important for your child to see you apologize for your own mistakes. In addition, apologizing to your child demonstrates your love and respect for her as a human being.If your child causes a mess in a restaurant or cafe, for example, let the manager know right away and apologize for the situation. Your child will observe you taking responsibility for the situation and interacting respectfully with another adult.

, Taking on tasks and jobs around the house helps children to develop a sense of confidence and independence. By allowing your child to lend a helping hand with errands, you help them develop socially, as they watch your interactions with others and get to practice interacting with strangers in a safe setting.Even failing at a chore can provide a useful learning experience.Even toddlers can take on simple jobs. For example, they can put dirty clothes in a hamper or toys back in a bin.Slightly older children, between ages three and five, love to count and sort. Ask your five-year-old to count out apples at the store or match socks in the laundry., You don’t need to become a perfect person to be a good parent and role model. Identify, with your co-parent if possible, what qualities you would most like to instill in your child. Then, look for ways to model those qualities.


For example, if generosity is important to you, you might say out loud: “I’m going to give the person behind us our extra train ticket. It’s nice to share with others!”, Make sure that you’re modeling good behavior in a way that your child can easily see and copy. For example, don’t only read after he/she’s gone to bed for the night, or hug your partner when the children aren’t looking., Children are profoundly affected by their parents’ stress levels. Model good stress management for your child by making time for exercise, friends, and your partner.Notice how you talk about yourself in front of your children. For example, instead of saying, “I feel fat and ugly in this sweater,” say, “I don’t like wearing this sweater.”, Having a child often reawakens complex feelings left over from the parent’s own childhood. This can lead you to be critical of, or ambivalent about, your child, when really you are struggling with self-critical attitudes. Don’t blame yourself for these reactions, but do talk about them with another adult, whether a partner, a friend, or a counselor., Don’t insist that your child eat his/her vegetables while subsisting on fries and cookies yourself. Instead, try to prepare healthy meals that you can share.


It’s fine to drink in moderation in front of your children. In fact, it helps them to see an adult have a healthy relationship to alcohol. Explain that alcohol is something that is ok for adults, but not for children.However, if drinking is interfering with your daily life or relationships, get help.Do not smoke around your children. Second-hand smoke has serious health consequences., Your child will learn about how to live a good, fulfilling life by watching your value yourself and your priorities. You do not need to sacrifice yourself for your child or live your life through your child.For example, make time to pursue a hobby or sport that you care about. Your child will benefit from seeing you prioritize something you love. He/She will also benefit from seeing you maintain adult friendships through an activity you enjoy.

, Notice even small improvements. For example, if your toddler gets angry but refrains, finally, from hitting his/her sister, point that out explicitly.Use “labeled praise” that lets your child know exactly what he/she’s doing right. For example, rather than saying, “You’re being good today!” say, “I really like how you helped your little brother/sister out just now.”, You and your child will each take roles in an imaginary difficult situation modeled on a real problem area. Narrate the situation and begin to role play. Offer feedback as well as praise. This technique helps your child to think ahead when faced with frustrating situations.For example, you might say to a younger child: “Let’s pretend I’m your friend, but I won’t let you play with any of my toys. How can you let me know that you’re mad?”With an older child, a more elaborate role play is possible. For example, you could describe a scenario in which the child wants to share that something bad happened at school, but you’re not home from work yet. Ask your child how he/she would feel, and invite him/her to think about what he/she might do, such as writing or drawing about the incident to share later. Then, act out the imaginary conversation you might have once you do get home., Manage your own anger and emotional reactions. In addition to preventing a bad situation, this models healthy behavior.If your child is sarcastic, rude, or rebellious, you must not take their words and actions personally. Focus on their behavior rather than your theories about why they are acting badly.Remind yourself that this is not an emergency. Your emotions may have triggered a flight-or-fight response, but in fact you have plenty of time to deal with the situation.
Take a time out for yourself, explaining: “I’ll be back in a minute, once I’m calmer.” Soothe yourself with deep breaths, some cool water, and reassurance. Remind yourself that you are a good parent and you will be able to handle the situation., Model respectful conflict resolution instead. Children who are hit or spanked will learn that violence is a valid method for solving problems.What’s more, you are at risk of losing control of yourself when you hit your child. Even if physical violence stops a bad behavior in the short term, in the long term it damages your relationship with your child and can cause mental and emotional problems for him/her later on."

Teach things to your child.,
Always keep your promises.,
Treat your child like a friend.,
Listen.,
Make time for your child.,
Try to work with them when there is a problem, instead of working against them.,
Respect who they are, quirks and all.,
Let them know you love them.",How to Be Trusted by Your Kids," When your child is open to conversation, try mentioning a topic that they don't know much about. If they seem interested, teach them some new things about it. They will consider you to be a reliable source of information.


Try to engage with your child's interests. For example, if your daughter loves history, offer to tell her a story about the Revolutionary War.
Pick out movies and library books to teach them about their favorite things. If your son enjoys drawing, bring home a book about drawing cartoons.;
, Sticking to your word shows that you are trustworthy, and they can count on you when they need you.


If you aren't sure if you can keep a particular promise, don't make it.
If something changes and absolutely forces you to break the promise, explain to your child what happened. Apologize sincerely, and offer to make it up to them.

Ideally, give them something better. For example, ""I couldn't take you to your playdate because I was stuck in a huge traffic jam. To make it up to you, how about I help you plan a sleepover party, so you can play with all your friends?"" If your son loves sleepovers, he should walk away feeling happy.
Only do this in emergencies. Too many broken promises, and your child will stop trusting you at all.



, Respect them, and don't yell at them or pull parental authority on them (except in emergencies). Treating them like a competent and likable person will make them enjoy being with you.

, Pay close attention when they talk to you, nod your head, and engage with the topic of conversation (even if it isn't your favorite topic). Show that you care about what they think. Seek to understand before you try to judge or correct them.


Ask them about their day, and listen.
Respect their emotions (even if they conflict with what you want). This signals that you care about them no matter what.
Don't pry. If they don't want to tell you about something, accept that, and tell them that you'll be here if they need you. They will be much more likely to come to you when they feel ready.

, Closeness won't happen overnight, and it takes effort to form a trusting relationship with your child. Spending time together will show your child that they matter to you, and it will give you an opportunity to bond. You could go to a playground, do arts and crafts, engage with your child's hobbies, read books, attend local events, go for walks, et cetera.

, For example, if your child shouted and slammed the door, ask him why he did that, and try to solve the problem. Help him find more constructive ways to respond to anger. Try making a list together.


If your child is very upset, let them cool down before discussing the problem. Time spent in their room or in a calming down corner may be what they need first.
Only raise your voice or threaten punishment if it is a severe and time-sensitive issue (e.g. a safety threat) or deliberate misbehavior (e.g. you've asked her several times to stop hitting, but she continued).

, If your son likes pink and purple, let him like pink and purple, and maybe buy him some pink and purple shirts. If your daughter is autistic, encourage her special interest in engineering, and tell her that she isn't a burden. Children feel much more trusting and secure if they feel that you are not at war with a fundamental part of who they are.


Try not to interfere unless they're placing themselves in harm's way (e.g. smoking). If you're worried about them, make it clear that it's due to one specific action, not to their identity.

, That's what they care about most.

Talk to your child.,
Spend time with your child.,
Build your child’s self-esteem.,
Recognize any unintentional bullying on your behalf.,
Give your child more responsibilities as they get older.",How to Avoid Raising a Bully1," Be interested in your child’s life, and check in with them on a regular basis. Ask questions like what they’re working on in school, how their friends are, and what’s been getting under their skin lately.Give your child your full attention when you talk with them. Kids know when you’re tuning them out or just pretending to be interested.
Don’t try to force your child to talk to you if they don’t want to, but do let them know that you’re available whenever they want to share something.;
, To have a close relationship with your child, it’s important to do more than just talk with them. Find some activities you can do together on a regular basis, such as cooking a meal, going for a walk, or working on a hobby you share. Use your time together to catch up and bond over shared interests.As you spend time with your child, make sure that you are modeling good behaviors for them. Avoid fighting with or criticizing your spouse when your child is around.

, Let your child know that you’re rooting for them, and offer sincere praise when they do something well. Don’t just focus on their achievements and skills – notice their positive personality traits like kindness, generosity, and helpfulness, too.For instance, you could say something like, “Jessica, I’m impressed that you stayed to help Maria clean up after her birthday party. That was thoughtful of you.”
Try to avoid criticizing your child as well. If they do something wrong, point out the behavior and then explain why it is not acceptable.

, Your behavior at home could be inadvertently influencing bullying in your child. If you're a parent who thinks children must be controlled by adults, you might use excessive disciplinary approaches. As a result, your child comes to believe that they must do the same to get their way.Observe your behaviors and take note of any excessive control techniques. Instead of trying to control your child, focus on teaching them to control themselves by helping them identify problem behaviors and come up with reasonable solutions on their own.

, Build up your child’s confidence by letting them try new things and solve their own problems. Ask them to take on household tasks that reflect their skills and interests."
"
Set a good example.,
Validate your child’s emotions.,
Talk with your child about how other people are feeling.,
Help your child find common ground.,
Teach your child good conflict resolution skills.",How to Avoid Raising a Bully2," Be kind and thoughtful in your interactions with your partner, your friends, and strangers. Make empathy a part of your own life. Avoid gossiping or putting others down.For instance, you shouldn't be overheard saying ""The sales rep better give me a refund or I'm going to snap!"" This sends the wrong message to your child.

, Show your child that you understand and care about how they feel. Help them build up their emotional vocabulary, so they’ll be better able to identify other people’s feelings, too.For example, say something like, “It sounds like you’re feeling really angry with Max for kicking you. It’s okay to be angry, but it’s not okay to kick him back.”
It is important to help your child learn how to deal with negative emotions because if they do not learn this, then they may act out in negative ways, such as by bullying., Ask your child to put themselves in other people’s shoes. Talk about the feelings of friends, strangers, and even animals. Help your child learn to empathize with a wide variety of others.For instance, say something like, “I wonder why that baby is crying. Maybe he’s hungry. Why do you think he might be crying?”

, Children find it easier to empathize with other people when they have something in common. Point out similarities between your child’s feelings and experiences and those of other people.For example, if your child has a classmate who rarely speaks to anyone, say, “I think Annie is really shy. You know what it’s like to feel shy around new people, don’t you?”

, It is important to teach your child skills to get their needs met through verbal negotiations rather than by using physical force. Set a good example by keeping your cool when you have an argument with someone. Show your child how to talk problems through and compromise. When your child has a conflict with someone, help them brainstorm positive ways to resolve it.For instance, you could say, “It sounds like you’re upset that Luke won’t play trucks with you. Maybe he would want to play if you did something different. Did you ask him what he wants to do?”

Nip mean behavior in the bud.,
Notice if your child is being bullied.,
Pay attention to your child’s friends.,
Talk with your child about any accusations of bullying.,
Get professional help.",How to Avoid Raising a Bully3," If you notice your child calling people names or teasing others, address the behavior right away. Let your child know why it’s not acceptable. Then help them find some alternate ways to behave.Say something like, “You probably didn’t know this, but it’s not okay to call people names, even if some of your friends do it. It makes other people feel bad about themselves. Let’s think of some other ways you can tell people you’re mad at them.”

, Kids who are bullied are more likely to become bullies themselves, often in an attempt at self-defense. If your child tells you that someone is picking on them, help them put a stop to it. Let the appropriate school authorities know what’s going on, and work with your child to come up with some strategies for staying safe.Keep in mind that siblings may bully each other as well. What may seem like sibling rivalry may actually be bullying, so pay attention to your child’s interactions with their siblings.

, Know who your child’s friends are, and keep an eye on their activities. Discourage your child from spending time with kids who bully others. If you don’t like your child’s friend group, get them involved in some new activities where they can make better friends.Be careful about forbidding your child from spending time with certain people. That might just make them like those friends even more. Instead, express your concerns by saying something like, “I’m not sure if I like Ben. He doesn’t seem to care about other people’s feelings much. Is he the kind of person you want to be like?”

, If your child’s teacher or another parent tells you that your child has been bullying others, take the accusation seriously. Sit down with your child and ask them if there’s any truth to the story. Let them know that bullying is unacceptable, and help them come up with a plan for changing their behavior.Look at the reasons behind your child’s behavior, not just the behavior itself.
For instance, if your child is bullying others because they’ve been spending time with other bullies, help them get out of that social environment and into a healthier one.
Try to find out if your child is struggling at school and/or at home. This may be driving them to act out in unhealthy ways.

, If you have trouble with your own bullying behavior, or your child already shows signs of bullying, get help as soon as possible. Early treatment could minimize your child's chance of become a bully and experiencing the negative outcomes associated with these behaviors.See a child or adolescent therapist in your area for professional help.
If you are struggling to overcome your own bullying behavior, it might be practical to see a family therapist.

Notice the quality of eye contact.,
Observe brief facial expressions.,
See if they are constantly fidgeting.,
Look for facial cues and touching.,
Look for strange gestures.",How to Know when Your Child Is Lying1," Your child may be lying if they avoid eye contact altogether or maintain unusual eye contact. If your child is younger, they will probably avoid all eye contact. If they are a little older and more sophisticated, they may make a point of maintaining eye contact for a long time, with wide eyes or an unusual expression.If they blink a lot while trying to maintain eye contact, it could be a sign of lying.;
, Your child may express very brief moments of fear, anger, sadness, surprise or despair while lying, which are sometimes called microexpressions. This occurs when someone is consciously trying to hide how they are feeling. You have to watch carefully to see these brief expressions of emotion, which sometimes last less than a second. See if you can discern any of the following emotions in their face while they are talking. If the emotion is at odds with what they are saying or seems out of place, it could indicate a lie:Surprise may be expressed with raised and curved brows, horizontal wrinkles on the forehead, eyelids open and the jaw dropped open.
Fear may be expressed with the brows raised and drawn together, wrinkles in the center of the forehead, whiteness in the upper eye showing, and the mouth open with tensed lips.
Sadness can be seen when the child is looking downwards, the upper eyelids are dropped, the cheeks are raised upwards, and the corners of the lip are turned down., If your child is unable to stay still while telling you their version of the story, it could indicate a lie. For instance, if you notice doing any of the following fidgeting behaviors, it is a warning sign: Constantly moving their hands.
Shifting in their seat.
Shuffling their feet back and forth.

, Studies have found a correlation between certain facial cues lying.See if your child bites their lip while talking to you. They may also lick their lips, which could also indicate a lie. If they touch their nose, face or head while talking, it could also indicate a lie., See if your child is holding their hands behind their back, or constantly shifting their feet or hands. Bodily gestures are a common giveaway of deceit in both children and adults. It could be as simple as your child holding their hands behind their back.Look for any of the following signs:Scratching their body while talking
Moving their fingers without their arms and for no reason
Strange movements, shakes or nods of the head
Shuffling or shifting of the feet and legs
Shifting position in their seat

Listen to pitch.,
See if they repeat the question.,
Notice if they get evasive.,
Avoid taking an investigative approach.,
Listen for emphatic statements in sibling rivalries.,
Pay attention to how their lying changes with age.",How to Know when Your Child Is Lying2," If their tone of voice or pitch goes up, it is often a sign of discomfort due to fear, anxiety or other difficult emotions. This is a telltale sign of lying. It may be a sign that your child feels very uncomfortable and has a sense that they are being forced to lie for some reason., If your child repeats a question that you ask them, they may be trying to buy more time to come up with a lie. For instance, if you ask what they did at school today and they repeat the question, there could be something they do not want to report., If your child avoids responding directly to a simple question, they could be trying to avoid having to lie. For instance, if they bring up a completely different subject in response to the question, they may be trying to avoid responding to the question. If you ask again and they offer a strange answer, it could be a lie., It is important to maintain a trusting, loving relationship with your child to decrease the chances that they will lie to you. You should avoid asking your child directly about the lie or pressuring your child for the truth of what happened. An investigative approach can lead to evasiveness and may not encourage your child to be more truthful.Instead, tell stories that encourage truth telling, such as ‘the boy who cried wolf’, and model the behavior you expect from your child. You can find a version of the children's story, 'the boy who cried wolf', here: https://www.storyarts.org/library/aesops/stories/boy.html

For example, you should avoid using an accusatory tone when asking questions like, ""tell me, are you lying right now?""

, In order to assert themselves with siblings, you children will often lie in order to get their way in an argument. If your child is making a statement in disagreement with a sibling, they may be lying in order to win a power struggle.If your child repeatedly says “no” in response to any question about an event or situation, they may be lying.
If your younger child has been fighting with an older sibling, they may be lying in order to assert themselves in the relationship.

, As your children develop, they will evolve in their relationship to lying and the truth. Whereas lying is often very obvious with younger children, it can get more sophisticated as they grow up. In older children, lying is often more accompanied by guilt. Listen and respond in accordance with their age and maturity:If your two-year-old is lying in a disagreement with a sibling, you could try expressing doubt in response to their lie so they know that you see their lie. For instance, if they claim that they did not eat a brownie, you could say, “That’s curious, why do I see chocolate all over your face.”
If your four-year-old is lying, you should use it as an opportunity to explain why lying is not okay in your household.
If your child is between five and eight, they may lie to avoid homework or otherwise reduce the pressures of increasing responsibility at school or at home. You should try to praise good behavior and talk openly about the importance of telling the truth.
If your child is between nine and twelve, you may notice they will experience more guilt when they lie. You should have longer and more open conversations about lying and truthfulness.

Consider a partial ""do-over"".,
Remember that weddings are typically a lot more enjoyable for guests than for the bridal couple.,
Consider your expectations for your relationship.,
Think of all the things you overcame to get to where you are.,
Look forward to the many things yet awaiting you.,
Remind yourself of these things often.,
Seek professional help.",How to Deal with Post Wedding Blues," Many big life events - such as marriage, graduation, or a big, important exam - can give way to a sense of anti-climax after they are over. The more you have worked towards a certain day or event, the more likely this is to happen after it has passed. Give yourself a break if you think you are the worst spouse ever for feeling down.;
, Your feelings are valid. You can be happy in your marriage and still feel sad that your wedding day is over or disappointment about things that didn't go according to your expectations. They are not mutually exclusive. You are entitled to feel sad over things that make you unhappy.

, If you believe that getting married is the highest possible achievement in your life, you are likely to stay focused on your wedding for a very long time. Many women, especially, are taught from childhood, whether in a cultural or religious context, that they should (only) aspire to being someone's wife, someone's chosen bride. That they are only valuable if someone marries them, that it is a mark of ""quality"" or a badge of honor, that no other achievement in their life compares to getting married. This is usually untrue and can be downright damaging.

, Regardless of whether or not you are in a relationship and regardless of the commitment of your relationship, you have value as a human being. Your wedding is not the only important thing that will ever happen in your life, and it is not your only source of value and happiness. Your other ambitions and achievements are important, regardless of societal or cultural expectations of you. While a happy relationship is a great source of joy to many people, it is not the only thing that defines you. You have talents and skills that affect the lives of others in meaningful ways. You do not only exist through and for your spouse. This means that a celebration of your relationship is also not the single most defining moment of your life. It is one of many experiences you will share.

, There are too many elements beyond your control. You planned it well, but you always have to rely on other people. It was, and is, a celebration of the love you and your spouse share. It is only the first day of the best time of your life. This is true, regardless of weather, cake, missing flowers, embarrassing speeches, or trip-ups down the aisle.

, This can help a lot. Did something go differently from what you had planned? Did your officiant leave out a part of their speech or did your cake never arrive? Did your photographer not show up or fail to videotape the parts most important to you? You could have a follow-up celebration (on your wedding anniversary, for example), either just for the two of you, or including friends and family, especially those who might not have been able to attend. Book a photo-shoot with your spouse and get back into your wedding clothes (or wear a different, seasonal outfit) if you are sad about not having pictures. There are no ironclad rules on ""how to get married properly"". If it makes you happy, do it. It is not silly, or ungrateful. It is something that you care about, and that is okay.

, Your wedding day most likely is not the most relaxed day of your life. It is a very stressful, adrenaline-filled day, which provides lots of happiness and love (since you see people who are close to your heart and they all show their love for you by participating), but which also exerts a lot of pressure. Depending on the chosen attire for your wedding, you might be uncomfortable in your clothes and glad to get out of that beautiful corseted gown you chose. Often times, you are so high-strung throughout the day that you will need photos and videos to remember the details of what happened and who was there. Do not be tempted to think ""the best day of my life is over"". Chances are, you might get less attention on another day, but be more at peace on a Sunday morning in bed with your spouse, or taking a walk or sharing a meal together.

, If you thought your wedding would somehow deeply change the relationship to your spouse, understand that this is very unlikely. That is to say, if your relationship was not happy before, getting married will not make it so. If this is the source of your disappointment, there are things you can do: Finding a therapist or a counselor, whether alone or for you as a couple, can help a lot. Your relationship does not somehow take care of itself, married or not. It is a series of decisions on both partner's sides about how you wish to treat each other and how you want to live as individuals and as a couple. You can influence how your relationship develops by learning about its dynamics. It very much is a learning experience. Learning more helpful communication skills can make a huge difference.

, You might have had to save a lot of money or live apart from your spouse due to work or schooling. You might have searched high and low for a place to live, or gone through a stressful move to live together. Be glad that all these things are done and you can enjoy some relief from the frantic planning and organizing to be together and actually share time with your spouse. If living together is disappointing to you and different from your expectations, check out some online resources such as advice columns, message boards, or wikiHow for some basic ideas on how to live together more comfortably.

, It could be your honeymoon, your first shared home, your first pet together, or your first child. You have so much to look forward to. Revel in the knowledge and security that your spouse wants to share their life with you and grow old together. Your wedding was only the beginning.

, Once the razzle-dazzle of the wedding has died down, take your spouse out for a meal (or cook something, if you want to celebrate your newly won domesticity). Look for the beauty in your shared day-to-day life and celebrate your union by appreciating each other and the choice you both made to be together.

, If the blues don't go away after a few weeks or is getting worse - it may be time to seek a professional counselor for yourself or a marriage counselor for the both of you.

You'll need to attend a religious school to become ordained if you want to perform wedding ceremonies.
You'll need online ordination credentials if you will be conducting an occasional wedding ceremony for family or friends. Many Internet sites offer online ordination credentials, as well as instructions and training for performing wedding ceremonies.;
, Each state has specific laws about who can legally conduct a wedding ceremony. If you are not sure of the laws, contact the local county clerk where the wedding will be held. Ask what you need to do to register in order to perform a legally binding wedding in that state.

, The couple may have a specific type of ceremony in mind for their wedding. Some couples may want a traditional wedding ceremony, while others may choose to create their own ceremony. Find out exactly what the couple desires for their wedding ceremony prior to the event.

, Most wedding ceremonies consist of 7 parts: the procession, invocation, declaration of intent, vows exchange, ring exchange, pronouncement and recession. A wedding officiant should write down the order and language of each part of the ceremony, so he or she can refer to it as needed during the ceremony.


Organize the procession. The procession is the beginning of the wedding ceremony, during while the guests are seated, the wedding party enters and the bride enters. The procession is typically accompanied by music. In some traditions, the bride is accompanied by her father during the procession, but in others, both parents process in with the bride. The bride also can process in by herself.
Write the invocation. During the invocation, the officiant greets the guests, introduces the couple and announces the purpose of the gathering. Some couples choose to include a special reading from a religious text or poem during the invocation.
Prepare the declaration of intent. During the declaration of intent, the officiant asks the couple if they will marry each another. The declaration confirms that the bride and groom are willingly entering into a marriage covenant. Couples usually respond with ""I do"" or ""I will"" to the officiant's questions of intent. Traditionally, the officiant asks the wedding guests if anyone present objects to the wedding during the declaration of intent. However, this tradition, which dates back to the 1920s, is not required.
Prepare the vows exchange. Some couples want traditional wedding vows while other couple want to write their own. If the couple prepares their own vows, the officiant should remain quiet and attentive. If the couple chooses to use traditional vows, the officiant may ask the bride and groom to repeat the vows after him. In this case, the officiant should speak slowly and clearly so the bride and groom can repeat the vows without forgetting or stumbling over words.
Organize the ring exchange. During the ring exchange, the bride and groom place wedding rings on each other's fingers. In some traditions, the ring exchange may include spoken vows that usually begin with the phrase, ""with this ring, I thee wed."" If the ceremony includes ring bearers, they will present the rings to the couple. Otherwise, the best man typically gives the rings to the officiant, who may bless the rings before giving them to the couple. Following the ring exchange, some couples may choose to include a special ritual in the wedding ceremony, such as lighting a unity candle, presenting roses to the parents or sharing a meaningful song.
Prepare the pronouncement. During the pronouncement, the officiant declares that the couple is now married. In many traditions, this is when the bride and groom kiss for the first time as a married couple, sealing their wedding vow with a kiss. The officiant often includes a phrase like, ""by the authority vested in my by the state of (where the wedding is taking place) during the pronouncement to show that the wedding is spiritually and legally binding.
Organize the recession. During the recession, the newly married couple exits the ceremony space, followed by the bridal party, family and guests. The officiant may follow the bridal party out of the ceremony space to greet guests, or may wait until all guests have recessed.

, A wedding ceremony rehearsal is a time for the bride, groom, wedding party and family to practice the actual ceremony. The wedding rehearsal is typically held the evening before the wedding. During the rehearsal, the officiant guides the bride, groom and wedding party through each part of the ceremony. If the bride and groom are writing their own vows, this gives them an opportunity to practice their vows.

, The officiant performs the ceremony at the appointed time on the wedding day. The officiant should not deviate from the order or language used at the wedding ceremony rehearsal. Additionally, the officiant should be prepared to offer encouragement to the bride and groom, who may be nervous about speaking in front of their guests.

, Depending on the state laws, the officiant may be required to sign a marriage license. In many cases, the officiant also is responsible for getting the license signed by 2 witnesses and then mailing the license to the proper state officials. If the officiant does not sign the marriage license, he or she may supply the couple with a signed wedding certificate as a keepsake of the special day.

Use a secure card box.,
Match the box to the wedding theme.,
Include photographs on your card collection box.",How to Collect Cards at Your Wedding1," If you choose to collect cards using a card box, make sure it is secure. Choose a card box that has a lock. The card box should have a single slit in the top. It should remain locked throughout your wedding festivities. Give the key to a family member or friend you trust, and arrange for this person to place the card box in a secure location after the event., If you are creating a box to collect cards at your wedding, consider matching it to your wedding theme. For example, if your theme echoes a royal British wedding, consider using a quaint British letter box. Or, if your wedding has a whimsical forest theme, decorate your card box with moss and tree branches.For example, try using a wedding-themed piñata as a card collection box.

, Adding photographs to your card collection box is a great way to personalize what could otherwise be a bland, run of the mill secure white card box. You can place photos of you and your spouse on or around the box to add some personal flair."

Follow through with consequences.,
Be consistent.,
Talk to your child about your expectations.,
Find ways to follow through no matter where you are.",How to Avoid Making Idle Threats to Your Kids1," Idle or empty threats are common, and children generally know that. They won’t respond or change their behavior if they don’t believe that their parents will follow through. This makes your child stop looking at you as an authority figure. When you say you are going to punish them or give them consequences, make sure that you do that.By giving your child a lot of idle threats, you can negatively impact the relationship that you have. This can cause discipline problems later in life.;
, Having consistent discipline helps establish rules and boundaries for your child. Being consistent with your discipline and following through helps your children have a routine and understand consequences for their actions.Being consistent means giving a punishment each time they misbehave, not just sometimes. You can also create specific punishments for certain behaviors, so you and your child know what to expect if they do a certain thing.

, After misbehavior occurs, take your child aside or somewhere where the two of you are alone. Talk to them about the misbehaving incident. Explain what the problem was and what you expect from them.For example, you may say, “Tonight, you jumped on the couch while we had guests. That behavior is not acceptable. If you are excited or upset, it is not okay to jump on the furniture. We can find a better way for you to act if you are excited. Next time you jump on the furniture, you will receive a timeout.”
You might also consider taking something away from them as a form of punishment. For instance, say that they can’t watch a show they enjoy if they continue to engage in bad behavior.

, Sometimes, it may not be convenient to follow through with a warning. However, you still need to be consistent and follow through with the consequences for your child. Find a way to follow through even if you are in public.For example, if you are at a party, you may say, “I will put you in time out if you do not stop jumping on the furniture.” If they don’t stop, take them to an empty room, outside, or in a corner - any place they can have a time out. You can find benches or less populated areas if you are in a store or restaurant.

Designate a secure space where guests can place cards.,
Decorate the space.,
Ask someone to secure the card collection site.",How to Collect Cards at Your Wedding2," Having a special place where guests can leave cards means they won’t get lost or damaged during your reception. It also allows guest to drop off cards at the beginning of the event, rather than carrying them around until the evening’s end. If you choose to collect cards in a card box, make sure you place the box in a secure location that is also accessible to guests. Place the card box on a table that is not near any of the exits, which will make it more challenging for a thief to make a mad dash with your cash.

, You can use the same table as a place for your guest book and as a drop-off place for gifts other than cards, or you can designate an entirely different space for guests to leave their cards. Make it clear that guests should place their cards there. For example, you can decorate with a creative sign that reads, ""Cards."" You can also decorate the space with photos of the couple, flowers, or any other decor that matches your wedding theme.

, If you decide to collect cards out in the open, such as in a card box or on a card table, make sure you have someone watching over the space. Cards often contain cash and can be easily snatched by a wedding thief. Having someone keep an eye on your cards can prevent theft.


Try asking a trusted friend, family member, or wedding staff to watch over the card box.

Appoint a gift attendant.,
Ask venue staff to collect cards.,
Collect the cards yourself.,
Thank your guests.,
Place the cards in a secure place after collection.",How to Collect Cards at Your Wedding3," Ask a trusted friend to be the appointed collector of cards at your wedding. Instead of displaying cards out in the open, such as on a gift table, ask your friend to take cards from the guests. Have your gift attendant store the cards in a secure place, such as a locked room, until the end of the festivities., If you don’t want to set up a table to collect cards at your wedding, you can ask your wedding planner or venue staff to collect them for you. Let your wedding planner or staff at the venue where you are holding your wedding know that you want them to collect the cards during your reception.

, Consider ditching the card table altogether. Instead, drop a line in your invitation that tells guests you will be visiting each table during the reception and collecting cards in person. This will give you quality time with your guests and allow you to maintain personal control over the cards., Make sure you take time during your wedding festivities to thank your guests, especially as you collect the cards. Take time to chat with your guests individually as you collect the cards, and make sure you vocally show your gratitude for their cards.

, Whether you collect the cards yourself, or ask wedding staff to do it for you, it is important that your cards end up in a secure spot after collection. This can be a secure hotel room or a locked vehicle.

Avoid making extreme threats you could never carry out.,
Think before you offer a punishment.,
Ignore the behavior at first.,
Use “I” statements in your warnings.,
Talk to your child if you make an idle threat.,
Don’t be too hard on yourself.",How to Avoid Making Idle Threats to Your Kids2," Often, idle threats are extreme and over-the-top. The parents probably would never carry out the threat because it may harm the child. Don’t tell your child that you will do something that you would not feel comfortable following through on.For example, an extreme idle threat may be, “If you don’t stop, I’m going to leave you here” or “If you don’t eat, I’m not going to let you have any more food today.” These are threats that you wouldn’t carry out on your children.

, Many idle threats occur when a parent is frustrated and speaks without thinking. To help you avoid this, try to think through what you are saying before you say something to your child. This helps you make a conscious decision about the punishment you are confronting your child with.When your child misbehaves, take a deep breath. Count to five before speaking. Do whatever you need to do so that you have a few moments to think before speaking.
Ground yourself first. For example, you might take 5 deep breaths and then slowly count to 20 in your head to get some clarity.

, Instead of shouting an empty threat, try ignoring the negative behavior if you cannot deal with it right then. Sometimes, children misbehave for attention and threatening them gives them attention. Try ignoring them and taking a few minutes to calm down instead of giving them idle threats in frustration.For example, if you are at a party and your child is overly excited and acting out, don’t threaten them with something you won’t carry out, like going home or no dessert. Instead, give it a few minutes to see if they will calm down.

, When you make warnings, use “I” statements to emphasize what you plan on doing in response to their behavior. This helps set a clear consequence. Additionally, it helps go beyond the word “no” and other phrases that are similar, which your child may tune out.For example, say “I will throw away your toys if you don’t put them away in the next few minutes” instead of “You won’t have any toys if you don’t clean your room.”

, When a child knows you’ve made an empty threat, it leads to learned bad behavior. If you accidentally make an idle threat, make sure that you talk to your child to reestablish balance. Start by sitting down privately with the child.Apologize for making an idle threat.
Tell the child their behavior is unacceptable and you are not happy with how they have acted.
Set a more reasonable punishment for their behavior.

, Parents make mistakes, even if you focus on discipline and consistency. You get frustrated, stressed, and tired. When you feel this way, you may slip up and accidentally make an idle threat. If you do this, don’t beat yourself up. Remember, you are human and being a parent isn’t about perfection.If you make a mistake, accept it. Tell yourself, “I accidentally made an idle threat today. Next time, I will take a few deep breaths before I react.”

"
Make a list of rules and consequences.,
Give alternative choices.,
State the change in behavior instead of threatening your child.",How to Avoid Making Idle Threats to Your Kids3," If you and your child are aware of what is expected of them, it makes it easier to discipline and correct behavior. Make sure your child is aware of your rules and the consequences for breaking those rules. That way, if they misbehave, you don’t have to come up with a threat because you both already know the consequences.Think about including your child when making a list of rules and consequences. Kids can be more likely to follow rules if they had a say in creating them.
If you are doing something new, you may need to talk about new rules. For example, if you are going to someone’s home, you may let your child know they cannot run in the house or jump on the furniture. If you go on vacation, let them know they cannot run off without a parent or guardian.

, Instead of threatening your child, even if you will follow through, consider giving your child choices to alter the behavior. Offer an alternative to the behavior or ask them how you can solve the problem together.For example, if your child is jumping on the furniture, try giving them choices of alternative behavior. Try saying, “I know you’re having fun jumping on the couch, but the furniture is not meant for jumping. Would you like to go jump outside, or would you like to play with some toys in your room?”
You can ask your child how to fix the problem. You can say, “I know you want to go play outside, but I need to finish dinner. What can we do to solve this problem?”

, You can avoid making threats by changing the way you approach misbehavior. Instead of giving a cause and effect threat that is based on the continued bad behavior, tell the child what they are going to do to correct the behavior. Use a firm voice that isn’t raised in volume, and help them do the correct action if possible.For example, if your child won’t stop playing outside and come inside for dinner, don’t say, “If you don’t come in I will throw your dinner away.” Instead, tell your child, “It is time to come inside for dinner.” Wait for them to do it, and if they do not, go out into the yard and calmly lead them inside.
If you tell your child, “It is time to put your toys away and get ready for bed,” then help them put their toys away if they need a push to the correct behavior. Model correct behavior rather than rushing to punish.

Go for color themed favors.,
Opt for beauty themed favors.,
Choose holiday themed favors.,
Go for alcohol themed favors.,
Match the bridal shower theme to the wedding theme.",How to Choose Bridal Shower Favors1," If you are having a bridal shower that has a theme based around a color, such as the bride’s favorite color, have favors that match this theme.

, If you are having a holiday themed bridal shower, holiday themed favors may be the way to go. Perhaps you give everyone a Christmas ornament as a favor for a Christmas themed bridal shower. Or maybe you give everyone a decorated Easter egg as a favor for an Easter themed bridal shower.You can make the holiday themed favors more personal by writing the names of each guest on them or by writing the names of the bride and groom.

, If you are hosting a bridal shower that is focused on the bride’s favorite drink, such as wine or cocktails, give out alcohol themed favors. Perhaps you have small bottles of wine as favors for the guests or a cocktail making kit for the guests.If there are guests who are not drinking, you may create separate favors for them that are virgin so they can still enjoy their favors with everyone else.

, If the wedding has a clear theme, match the bridal shower to that theme so it feels more unified. You may then create shower favors based on a unified wedding and bridal shower theme.


For example, the wedding theme may be “spring.” You could then use this as the theme for the bridal shower and get favors that conjure up “spring,” such as small fresh flower displays or soaps that smell like spring.

Make sure you shop for the favors with a budget in mind so you do not overspend.


For example, if you have a budget of $20-$30 per a favor, you may go for high end favors or more expensive favors. Typically, the host can spend anywhere from $5-$20 on each favor, depending on their budget.

, You can also cut back on the other expenses for the bridal shower so you can afford to buy more expensive favors for each guest. Perhaps you make the food for the shower yourself rather than cater it to save money. Or maybe you host the shower at your home so you don’t spend money on the venue for the shower. This can then free you up to splurge on the bridal shower favors.You may write out your budget for the bridal shower and determine where you can cut back or save money. You can then go shopping for the favors with the leftover funds.

, If you have a tight budget for the bridal shower favors, try making them yourself, DIY style. This may be a good option if you are crafty and enjoy making small gifts for others.

After the ceremony, fold your hands in front of the gods by performing Satyanarayana Puja.",How to Celebrate a Traditional Hindu Wedding," This ceremony takes place two or three days before the wedding. During Haldi, a paste made of turmeric, gram flour, curd, sandalwood and rose water are applied on the hands, feet, and face of the bride and the groom.


Hindu weddings are full of color and vibrancy. A canopy of flowers will go up during this time in the house where the wedding will be and color will seem to pop up everywhere.;
, The bride and all of her close family members get the palms of their hands and feet decorated by a professional henna artist. The henna is believed to enhance the bride’s beauty. This ceremony usually takes place a day before the wedding.


This is similar to a bachelorette party, but without the antics and alcohol. It’s more about a celebration of the journey to marriage than the decoration or getting crazy.

, Traditionally, the groom arrives at the wedding on a horse, accompanied by his closest friends and family members. The large procession includes lots of singing and dancing. This signifies the groom’s and his family’s happiness in accepting the new bride.


Certain, more unconventional and modern, weddings will have the groom arrive in a cavalcade of cars., The bride’s family, armed with garlands and traditional Indian sweets, then welcomes the groom and his family. Milni is an important tradition where the groom’s family is honored by the bride’s family.


This is generally done at the house where the wedding is taking place. A red kum-kum (a powder) mark is applied to everyone’s foreheads. The members of each family are introduced to one another, encouraging peace and acceptance.

, Before the ceremony begins, a Ganesh Puja is performed for good luck. This is important as Ganesh is the destroyer of all obstacles. The ceremony generally involves both the bride’s and the groom's primary family members. This God is important to the Hindus and prepares them for their life ahead.

, First will be the bridegroom. He will be brought to a decorated altar called a “mandap”' and will be given a seat and a celebratory drink – a mixture of milk, ghee, yoghurt, honey and sugar.The arrival of the bride is called the kanya through the Kanya Aagaman. The bride is usually led by her father to the marriage altar, which signifies that the bride’s maternal side approves of the union. The bride and the groom are separated by a white cloth and not allowed to see one another just yet.

, Once the bride approaches the mandap (the altar area where the wedding rituals take place), the white cloth is dropped. The bride and the groom then exchange floral garlands. These garlands are to signify their acceptance of one another.


When the bride and bridegroom exchange garlands (jayamaala), they declare, “Let all the learned persons present here know, we are accepting each other willingly, voluntarily and pleasantly. Our hearts are concordant and united like waters.""An arranged marriage does not mean a forced marriage. In fact, forced marriages are now illegal in India. Though the two may not know each other, they are both willing to get married., At this point in the ritual, the father of the bride pours sacred water in her hand and then places her hand in the groom’s hand. This ritual signifies the father officially giving away his daughter. Then the groom’s sister usually ties the end of his scarf to the bride’s sari with betel nuts, copper coins, and rice. These items symbolize unity, prosperity, and happiness for the couple. The knot specifically is meant to represent the eternal bond that comes with marriage.


Recent weddings involve the exchanging of gifts, namely clothes and ornaments. The groom’s mother will give a “mangala sootra” to the bride, a necklace to indicate success. The bride’s father will then announce that his daughter has accepted the bridegroom and hopes that his family will accept her.

, At this point, a sacred fire will be lit and the Purohit (the priest) will recite mantras in Sanskrit. While the prayers are going on, oblations are offered to the fire. “Id na mama” is repeated over and over, meaning “it is not for me.” This emphasizes the virtue of selflessness required in marriage.

, During this ritual, the groom takes his bride's hand. This might be the first time the couple has physically touched one another. During this ritual the husband accepts his bride and vows to her and her parents that he will take care of and protect his bride for the rest of her life.


The bridegroom, while holding his wife's hand, will say, ""I hold your hand in the spirit of Dharma; we are both husband and wife.”, This starts with the bride climbing over a stone or rock, symbolizing her willingness and strength to overcome obstacles in her new marriage.


Then the couple walks around the fire four times, with the bride leading the first three. They will then join hands and offer barley to the fire, symbolizing that they will work for all of society and the good of humankind.
At this point, the husband will mark a parting in his new wife’s hair with red kum-kum powder. This is called “sindoor.” Every married woman can be recognized by this marking.

, At this point in the ceremony, the couple walks around the fire with seven steps, each accompanied by a prayer and seven vows. This is when the marriage becomes recognized by the state.


The first vow is for food
The second for strength
The third for prosperity
The fourth for wisdom
The fifth for progeny
The sixth for health
The seventh for friendship

, The manganese is a sacred necklace that the groom ties around the bride's neck on their wedding day. After he ties this necklace, he gives her the status of being his wife.


The bride is expected to wear this necklace as long as her marriage lasts. This necklace is a symbol of marriage, mutual love and commitment of the bride and groom to one another.

, After the wedding ceremony, the married couple receives blessings from their family members. The bride has blessings whispered into her ear by the women of both families. Then the married couple bows down before the priest and the elders’ family members and parents receive the final blessing.


As the newlyweds walk through the guests, they are showered with flowers and rice to wish the couple a long, happy marriage.

, This step means the bride will be going away to the groom’s house. The bride will say her final goodbyes to her family members. The bride is given joyfully but also can be bittersweet for the bride and groom and their families.


It is not uncommon to see tears during this stage. This is a very large transition for any woman, and it almost always is accompanied by a number of emotions, some happy, some sad.

, The bride is carried back in a doli from her parent’s house to her husband’s house. A ""doli"" is a decorated platform with a roof and four carrying handles on either side. It also has a comfortable mattress for the exhausted bride to sit on. The bride’s maternal uncles and brothers traditionally carry the doli.


In many modern weddings, the bride is just carried in the doli out of the house – not all the way to the husband’s house. She would ride in a car the rest of the way.

, With her right leg, the bride kicks the kalash (a pot) usually filled with rice. This kalash is kept at the door of the groom’s house. After the kicking takes place the bride walks her first steps in the house of the groom.


This is believed to bring about an abundance of food, wisdom, and wealth and be a ""source of life."" In old tales, it was viewed to contain the elixir of immortality., The reception is a huge formal party with lots of music to celebrate the successful wedding. This is the first public appearance of the bride and groom together as a couple. There are no formal traditions at the reception.


Many traditional weddings do not offer alcohol and offer an array of only vegetarian food, in keeping with their traditional religious beliefs.

, The Satyanarayana Puja is a popular ritual performed to please Narayan or Lord Vishnu. During this ceremony, the bride and the groom take a vow of truthfulness. This ceremony is supposed to bring the bride and the groom eternal peace and fulfill their material requirements. This puja usually takes places 2-3 days after the wedding.

See if anyone you know has any recommendations for any bakery that has served them successfully.,
Many of them will have portfolios featuring pictures of their past creations to give you a better idea of what they are capable of producing.,

Try to have an idea of what you might prefer, as well as the possible preferences of any guests, especially the members of either family, but be open to new combinations you might be offered.,
Discuss what kind of cake you would like to have as well as the wedding cake topper that will look best with it.,
If you have a preference for cake topper (like a ceramic or porcelain piece or using fresh flowers that reflect those used for the bridal bouquet or other decorations), now is the time to discuss them.,

, This includes the shape of the cake, what kinds of colors or special decorations you would like to see. Chances are the cake artist will make detailed sketches of what form the cake would take, including how simple or complicated the decoration would be.

, Depending on the ingredients used, the amount of labor that goes into the production, size and the use of non-edible decorations like hanging Austrian crystals, all will affect the cost of the cake. It is not unusual for a relatively modest cake to start at $500, with costs going up to $1500 and over for larger creations.

Determine if the retiree would enjoy a large party or prefer a small quiet gathering.,
Discover if the person who is retiring is happy about doing so or if he's anxious or depressed about it.,
Plan a party.,
Invite the appropriate people to the party.,
Commemorate the event.,
Adjust the level of humor.,
Choose the right gift if gifts are being given.,
Strive to keep in touch.,
Contact your newly retired friend.,
Visit your newly retired family member.",How to Wish Someone a Happy Retirement," Perhaps he or she would simply like to slip out the back door with little fanfare. In that case, a card signed by fellow employees or friends and family will suffice.;
, That will determine the tone of the farewell.

, The party can be held at the work place, in a hired hall, or in the local bar for drinks, depending on the person who is being honored and the situation.


The person or persons giving a toast or making a speech should keep the remarks both touching and humorous. Retirement parties often recap what the person did during his years at the organization.
Be aware of the person's health and plans. If he can't wait to retire and embark on a trip to Spain, for instance, work that into the theme of the party. The avid golfer who now has plenty of time to pursue his favorite sport will appreciate being reminded of that fact. When honoring a retiree who is quitting because of poor health, however, you should emphasize past accomplishments instead of focusing on the future.

,


Family, friends, and present and past colleagues are people you won't want to forget to invite.
If the retiree dealt with special clients or other important professionals outside the company, be sure to include them on the guest list.

,


Videotape the party or event so the retiree can view it again later.
Prepare an audio-visual presentation about the person's accomplishments and work history that can be shown on a monitor sitting on a table, or projected onto a large screen for all at the party to watch. Loop it to play continuously. Include photographs of the person both at work and at home with family. Add in photos of other important events such as a memorable trip or the birth of a grandchild.
Provide a blank memory book for guests to sign and encourage them to write down their memories of the past and good wishes for the future.

, Humor can be an important element in saying goodbye to someone who is retiring, but fit the humor to the person and situation.


Roast a colleague who enjoys bawdy or teasing humor. The company's practical joker, for example, might especially enjoy a round of robust humor from his co-workers.
Moderate the humor for someone who could become offended easily or who is finding the idea of retirement challenging.
Make sure the atmosphere of the retirement party always keeps a sense of dignity. The main focus is to honor the retiree.

, Instead of giving the ubiquitous watch, give something personal and meaningful to the recipient. A keepsake box filled with mementos from the job might be an idea. Think about the person's hobbies and interests to help you choose the right gift.

, Give guests the retiree's contact information.


Set up a website, if possible, where former employees can keep everyone updated about what is going on in their lives. Use a social website to keep up with the retiree.

, If you are already successfully retired, feel free to give tips and make suggestions about how to adjust. Try to be around for lunch or an activity.


Finding themselves suddenly alone with hours of free time can make many retirees anxious and depressed. Scheduled gatherings will give them something to look forward to. Remind them that you are happy and they can be too.

, Invite them to take a trip with you or to visit your family.


Let them know that this is a new, exciting stage of life, not an end. Let them know you are happy for them and wish them a happy, fulfilling retirement.

Determine your price range.,
Factor the gift into your overall wedding budget.,
Make a homemade gift if your budget is tight.",How to Choose a Gift for Your Maid of Honor1," Before you jump into deciding on a gift, you should consider how much money you are planning to spend on the gift for the maid of honor. If you are planning to get gifts for your entire bridal party, you may keep the price range for all the gifts on the low end. Or if you are planning to only give a gift to your maid of honor, you may go for a higher price range for the gift. Stick to what you can afford and determine a clear price ranged before you go shopping.For example, perhaps you decide to spend a bit more money on your maid of honor gift than on gifts for your bridesmaids. If you price range for the bridesmaids gifts is $40-$50, the price range for the maid of honor gift may be $50-$75.
Or if you are only getting a gift for your maid of honor, you may decide to spend $75-$100 on the gift.;
, You should also consider how much you can afford to spend on the gift based on your overall wedding budget. If you are planning an affordable, small wedding, for example, you may try to cut costs by keeping the price range for your maid of honor gift down. Or if you have a big budget to work with, you may end up spending a high amount on the maid of honor gift.You and your partner may discuss what you are each planning to spend on gifts for the bridal party overall.

Get the maid of honor a travel related gift.,
Give the maid of honor jewellery to commemorate the wedding.,
Treat your maid of honor to an experiential gift.",How to Choose a Gift for Your Maid of Honor2," If your maid of honor tends to enjoy a good self-care session, you may opt for a gift that reflects this preference.

Or gift them with a spa package of their dreams so they can chill out and treat themselves whenever they want.You can also put together the ultimate stay in basket complete with a bottle of wine, good chocolates, bad DVD movies, and face masks. Or you could give your maid of honor a certificate to a masseuse so they can enjoy a few hours of relaxation.

, If your maid of honor always seems to be traveling or has a passion for travel, give them a gift that will reflect this interest. You may find a map related gift, such as a world map bedspread, a world map poster where they can tack on all the places they have been and intend to go, or even world map themed jewellery. You could make the gift personal by including pictures of places you have traveled together as part of the gift.You may also get them items that they may need on their next trip, such as photography gear, travel clothing, or a travel toiletry set.

, Another popular maid of honor gift is an item of jewellery that will remind them of their important role in the wedding. You may get them a necklace with a pendant that has their initials on it or an image that is representative of your friendship. You could also get them a bracelet or earrings that you feel they would like as a sweet reminder of their role in your wedding.If you are getting the rest of your bridal party gifts such as jewellery, you may make the maid of honor’s jewellery a bit more special. For example, you may add a precious stone to the maid of honor’s jewellery to make it a bit more distinct from the other wedding party gifts.

, If your maid of honor is more into loving gestures than material items, you may give them a gift they can experience. For example, if your maid of honor loves to rock climb, you may get them an hour of free climbing at their local climbing center. Or if your maid of honor enjoys doing yoga, you may get her an unlimited pass for a month at a local yoga studio.Another option is to get the maid of honor an experiential gift they can share with someone else. For example, maybe there is a local restaurant that you both love to go to. You may then get the maid of honor a gift certificate to the restaurant that they can use to take their partner or a friend.

Reach out to your groom for advice.,
Ask close friends or family.,
Talk to other married or engaged friends.",How to Choose a Gift for Your Maid of Honor3," If you are struggling on what to get your maid of honor, you may speak to your groom about the decision. Ask them what they think the maid of honor might like and discuss gift ideas with them. You may ask your partner what they are getting for their wedding party and their best man.

I’m not sure what to get my maid of honor and I would love your input.”

, You can also ask close friends or family for advice on what to get your maid of honor. This may be a good idea if your family and friends are close to the maid of honor and know their taste. You may present several options to friends and family that are in your budget and then see what they say.For example, you may say to your family and friends, “I’m stuck on what to get my maid of honor. I have a few options. Which one do you think they would like best?”

, You can also figure out a good maid of honor gift by asking others who may also be currently planning their wedding or who have planned a wedding in the past. Ask them what they got for their maid of honor and how they determine the ideal gift for that person.


For example, you may ask a married or engaged friend, “How did you decide what gift to get your maid of honor? Can you give me some advice?”

Start your search early.,
Decide if, in fact, you need a rabbi.,
Look for a rabbi you can work with.,
Know the fee schedule upfront.",How to Choose a Rabbi to Officiate Your Wedding1," Many rabbis are in demand for weddings and other services, sometimes booking their schedules years in advance. You're more likely to get the rabbi you're interested in having conduct your wedding do so if you give him or her enough lead time.;
, Under Jewish tradition, having a member of the clergy is not necessary to have a Jewish wedding. The bride and groom marry each other. All that Jewish law requires are the ketubah, 2 male or female kosher witnesses and someone knowledgeable enough to conduct the ceremony according to Jewish tradition. Whoever conducts the ceremony must be licensed in the state you're marrying in.


If you and your future spouse belong to the same synagogue, you're in luck! If the two of you belong to different synagogues, talk to BOTH rabbis about what to do.
A cantor is also a member of the Jewish clergy and is licensed to perform weddings. If you want music to be important to your wedding and/or a rabbi is not available, the cantor can perform the ceremony. You can also have both a rabbi and cantor if you wish.
Some states allow Quaker-style weddings, which have no officiant but incorporate readings and blessings for the couple, with everyone attending serving as witness. Some couples accordingly choose to adapt Jewish traditions to this style of wedding.
If you choose neither a cantor nor a rabbi, check to see if your planned officiant works with a rabbi who can sign the ketubah.

, You may have certain ideas you want to incorporate into your wedding, such as writing your own ketubah contract text or using gender-sensitive language to refer to God. You'll want to choose a rabbi whose approach to the wedding matches your own.


Prepare a series of questions to interview prospective rabbis. You should cover such things as the rabbi's general approach to weddings, his or her attitude on the liturgy, whether you can schedule times to consult about the wedding, whether he or she wishes to oversee setting up the chuppah and other important factors.
Your prospective rabbi may ask you and your future spouse to attend one pre-marital counseling sessions prior to the wedding. This assures the rabbi that you have prepared for married life and not just the marriage ceremony and gives the rabbi the opportunity to see if he or she can work with you.
If the marriage is an interfaith marriage, be aware that Orthodox and Conservative rabbis don't perform interfaith ceremonies, and while Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis are permitted to do so, many choose not to. In such a case, it may be necessary to find a non-affiliated rabbi, especially if the ceremony is to be jointly officiated by clergy of the faith of each half of the couple. Joint ceremonies are the best way to go.

, If you choose a rabbi other than a family friend, you'll likely have to pay a deposit to reserve his or her services. A rabbi's honorarium, or fee, should cover the time spent officiating the wedding, meeting with the couple beforehand, telephone conversations, and advice on Jewish customs. If the wedding is a destination wedding, travel arrangements for the rabbi should be included. However, if the rabbi chooses to bring a spouse or stay over at the destination, the rabbi should be expected to pay those additional expenses.

Determine exactly what a young age is.,
Learn to manage finances.,
Get a college education.,
Save early, save often.,
Reduce your expenses.",How to Retire Young1," Young may be 40 or 50. In determining this age you'll want to be reasonable. If you're already 27 with no net worth, it is going to be very difficult to retire at 30, so the first step is setting the age you want to stop working.;
, Before you start bringing in the money necessary to retire young you'll want to know how to manage your money. There are countless amounts of stories of people who win the lottery, and end up miserable and penniless. No matter how much money you make it is important to manage it well.


Start and stick with a budget. A budget will help you control everything from how much money gets saved to how much money gets spent each month. If you haven't started budgeting already, do it. It's amazing how many people don't know how much money is coming in and going out each month. You can't be responsible like that.

, The studies are concrete: People with college degrees on average will make more over the course of their lifetimes than those without. These days a Bachelors Degree is what a High-School Diploma was 20 years ago. Find your passion, and get a degree (and subsequently a job) in that field. Think of a college degree as an investment in your future.

, The earlier you start saving, the quicker you'll retire. It's a devilishly simple idea, but it's hard to execute, and this is why: we humans value the tangibility and utility of the present over the far-off possibilities of the future. But you're not one of the unthinking masses, are you? You like the idea of saving early and saving often, because you know early retirement is sweet and attainable.


In your twenties, experts say that you should at the very least put away 10% of your income straight into savings. This much should be easy to do in your twenties, even if it means you have to skimp a little bit.
If you can, save any and all disposable money that isn't used to pay expenses, minus a bit of money for discretionary spending. If you earn $3,000 a month and have $1,500 in bills, squirrel away $1,250 each month and give yourself an extra $250 to do as you please.

, As in, big time. Increasing your earning potential won't do much good if you increase how much you spend the same amount. To put it simply: If you make $20,000 more per year, but increase your cost of living by $20,000 per year you haven't traveled very far on your road to retiring.


Rent instead of buy. Go to the library and rent books instead of buying them and then letting them attract dust forever. Watch movies online instead of buying DVDs. Renting may not make you feel powerful, but it will sure help you feel prudent.
Take advantage of free stuff. There are whole websites devoted to people who believe in freecycling. Sign up for a (free) conference and partake in their buffet luncheon. When you travel, try couch-surfing. The world is full of wonderful opportunities to get free stuff; just make sure you're respectful and courteous doing it.
Carpool if you can. With the rising cost of gasoline, you can potentially save $200-$300 a month on gasoline alone. This works out to a savings of $2,400-$3,600 per year.
Wash your laundry in cold water. Detergent manufacturers sell specially formulated detergents meant for washing clothes in cold water.
With cell phones being commonplace, consider whether you really need a land line in your home. If you do need one, some companies offer phone services using the internet, which is cheaper than regular land lines.
Use LED or fluorescent bulbs in your home. Not only are they just as bright, but use much less electricity.
Buy necessities in bulk. While the initial cost may be higher, you will save money in the long run. This includes water, toiletries, and food.

, If the rabbi who officiated those ceremonies moved you, perhaps that rabbi could officiate your wedding, too. While he or she may not live in your area, that rabbi could still officiate if he or she has no congregational responsibilities.

, They may know a rabbi who has moved them in the past, either at temple or at a wedding they've been to perhaps even their own.

, Rabbinical students are eager to practice their skills, and they're supervised by faculty members with more experience that they and you can draw on if problems arise while planning the wedding.

, Many rabbis without congregational responsibilities advertise their availability to conduct weddings online. These sites also frequently include information on what traditions are associated with a Jewish wedding and have links to vendors that can supply such things as the chuppah and the glass to be broken.

, If you don't have Internet access, or want to keep your search local, you can find a list of rabbis and synagogues in the Yellow Pages of your telephone book.

, Shabbat services are open to all, but if you don't feel comfortable attending a synagogue you're not used to, look for a panel discussion or lecture led by a rabbi. If you and the rabbi hit it off, contact the rabbi to see if he or she does weddings.

Don't get fooled by get-rich-quick scams.,
Get a Roth IRA.,
Get a certificate of deposit (CD).,
Purchase appreciating assets.,
Outsource your work, if possible.,
Create an automatic income source.,
Avoid bad debt.,
Enlist the services of a financial planner or advisor.,
Take advantage of a 401(k) policy if your company offers it.,
Plan finances according to time.",How to Retire Young2," They're out there almost everywhere you look: scams that promise easy money with very little effort. The problem is, with them being so widespread, why aren't more people rolling in free money? The painful truth is that it's extremely, extremely hard to get rich, and it's extremely likely that giving your hard-earned money to one of these schemes is a lot like flushing it down the drain. If it's too good to be true, it probably is.

, The Roth IRA is a special savings account that lets you bypass taxes provided that you keep your money in it for a certain time (usually after you're 59½ years old). You don't have to keep all your retirement savings in your Roth IRA, but it's a good idea to make tax free dollars for when you're older than 60. There are several big advantages of Roth IRAs:


You choose an investment plan for your money. Your money gets invested in a portfolio instead of just sitting there, meaning that it can grow much larger than if you put it in regular old savings and get a measly 1% interest rate.
Compound interest. Roth IRAs generate interest on your interest, which is called compound interest in the industry. You need to let your money sit for a while in a Roth IRA, but once you do, your money will start generating huge amounts of interest, which only then get bigger.

, Investing your money in a CD is a good way to put money to use that you know you won't lose to be missing for a while. When you put your money in a 1-year term CD, you can't withdraw it for a year (because the bank lends it out). After that period, you get your money back, plus interest. The longer the term of the CD (you could give some of your money away for 20 years), the higher the interest rate.



Note: This is a way to beat inflation, and shouldn't be a large part of an investment strategy. Inflation happens when the government prints more currency, and the value of the total currency goes down. Do this if you're worried about inflation, not as a way to get rich.

, Everyone knows that when you buy a car it loses much of its value as soon as you drive it off the lot. Assets like these are called depreciating assets. Make as few of these purchases as possible. Instead, buy things that increase in value over time. Examples of appreciating assets include:


Houses (usually, although the housing crisis of 2008 proved that wrong)
Stocks (usually, adjusted for inflation, the stock market has steadily climbed since 1900.)
Small business (usually, but not always)

, The beauty of the global economy is that you can work with people across the globe in real time, in an engagement that is hopefully mutually beneficial for both parties. If you are self-employed, definitely consider outsourcing some of the work to cheaper markets. If your job is very clerical, consider outsourcing parts of it so that you can find time investing your energy into other profitable pursuits.

, It doesn't have to be a 401K, but you should set yourself up to receive funds even while you're not working. You could start a blog with advertisements on each page, or write articles for a revenue sharing site. Whatever you decide needs to generate income on its own; that way when you stop working, you can still pay your bills. Other automatic income sources include:


Affiliate marketing programs
Drop-shipping retail store
Many more

, A certain amount of debt is fine to have, as long as you have a plan to pay it off and you're using it for something that's valuable. But too much debt can get you into a vicious cycle.


Bad debt looks like this:
Heavy debt on your credit card for purchases that have long since lost their value. You're only paying the minimum payments and your interest rate is at a whopping 20%, before tax.


Good debt looks like this:
A mortgage on a nice home that's less than what you would pay to rent the home. The down payment on your home was over 20%, and the home is in a neighborhood that's gradually increasing over time.



, Sure, a financial advisor will cost you some money, especially if they're a good one. But a good financial planner will also make you a ton of money; they understand the stock market, how to diversify accounts to spread out risk, and have financial savvy to see when the headwinds are changing. A good financial planner is someone who always has your back and who always forgives your mistakes while offering you the best financial advice in the world.

, A 401(k) policy is where your company funnels a small portion of your paycheck into a separate, tax-deferred savings account. The maximum current yearly contribution to 401(k) is $18,000.The great part of about 401(k)s is that your out-of-pocket contributions may be matched by your employer, depending on their policy. This means that whatever amount you decide to put into your 401(k), you employer will put in the same amount. If your employer does match contributions, definitely take advantage of that policy. It's the closest thing to free money you may ever get.

, Now that you know how much time you have until your youthful retirement age, plan what you need to do to get there. Don't be afraid if you need to make drastic adjustments. It will all be worth it once you're laying on a hammock enjoying your fruity beverage.

Prepare for the emotional shift.",How to Retire With Security," Some employers have traditional pension plans, where you're paid a set amount of money each year after retirement. Start learning about your employer's pension plan and how much money you'll get from it each year. You should also know what will happen to your pension plan in the event you change jobs. When budgeting for retirement, keep your pension plan in mind., The best way to retire with security is to find a job with retirement benefits. Ask your boss about what retirement benefits, if any, your job provides.


401(k) accounts, which allow you to put pre-tax money from your paycheck towards retirement, are your best bet for securing retirement funds. Ask your boss about 401(k) and similar options provided. Look into how much you're putting away each year. Putting $50 to $100 per paycheck towards your retirement will really add up over time. Also, some employers match 401(k) contributions if you've been employed for a certain amount of time.403(b) plans are similar to 401(k) plans, but they are for employees of nonprofit organizations. If you work for a public schools system, hospital, home health service agency, welfare service agency, or church, you may be able to enroll in a 403(b) plan.457 plans are like 401(k) plans for state and local government employees. The benefit to a 456 plan is that the employer may also offer a 401(k) retirement plan, and the employee has the option to contribute to both a 457 and 401(k) toward his retirement.A Roth 401(k) plan combines elements of a traditional Roth IRA with a 401(k) plan. Your contributions will not be tax-deductible; however, if you withdraw from the plan when you are older than 59 1/2 and have had the plan for over five years, then the distributions are given tax-free.You can also contribute more to a Roth 401(k) than you can to a traditional Roth IRA. You also don't have any limitation on when you start taking distributions from the Roth 401(k) (other plans require you to begin taking them by age 70 1/2).The benefit of pre-tax investing depends upon your tax brackets now and in retirement. You'll want to pay taxes on your investment when your marginal tax rate is lowest.The SIMPLE plan (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) is often offered by smaller employers. Employee contributions are tax deductible, and the employer can make matching contributions of up to 3% of the employee's salary.A SEP plan (Simplified Employee Pension) is another plan that makes it easy for small businesses to set up retirement funds. It has the same investment, distribution, and rollover requirements as traditional IRAs, but employees can contribute up to 25% of their salary.Rollovers are tax-free transfers of retirement funds between employers, assuming the rollover qualifies. Both the original and new employer retirement plan must allow for rollovers in order for this to work.Not every place of employment provides retirement benefits. If your job does not, you could begin searching for a job that does make these offers. However, you could also suggest your boss start some kind of retirement benefit plan. This could be a great way to attract new, talented employees. If you've been with the company a while, and your boss values your work, you might suggest she start providing retirement benefits., If you're putting money into a 401(K), pension plan, or individual account talk to your bank, boss, or personal accountant about automatic payments. This will eliminate the temptation of spending money and force you to put money away for retirement. Even setting aside a small amount of money for automatic savings will add up over time., If you don't have a retirement plan through your boss, or if you simply want extra, consider an individual retirement account. This is an account you can set up and add money to each year. You can add a maximum of $5,500 a year into an individual retirement account (be aware that this is not a fixed number and can change from year-to-year). If you're over the age of 50, you can put even more money into your account. Talk to an accountant about the possibility of an individual retirement account and how much you should be putting away to retire with security.You can participate in an employer 401(k) and an IRA at the same time.
Traditional IRAs contributions are made on a pre-tax basis and then are taxed at distribution. Roth IRAs are taxed at contribution and then have untaxed distributions. Roth IRAs are also subject to contribution limits based on your income, whereas traditional IRAs are not.Be aware that there may be deduction limits for your IRA if you or your spouse are covered by a retirement plan at work and your income is over $61,000 (if you are single) or $98,000 (if you are married).A common rule of thumb is to save 10–15% of your personal income each year, starting in your early 20s. However, this is just a general guideline. Your specific needs may mean you need to save more.You can find many retirement calculators online that go over how much you need to save given things like your 401(K), medical needs, pension plan, and so on. If you're unsure how much you should be putting away, consider trying an online calculator to get a range.Investment choices should be made to balance risk and return. Younger people can take higher risk than those approaching retirement, as investment risk is effectively reduced in the long run.

, Once you've made a savings plan, stick with it. Set yourself personal goals each month and year regarding how much money you'll set aside. Stick to these terms and avoid the temptation of spending money rather than putting it aside. Keep in mind that a small sacrifice in the present means you can enjoy financial security after retirement., If you're strapped for cash one month, it can be tempting to dip into your retirement. However, try to avoid doing so unless absolutely necessary. Not only will you lose money you've been putting away, there may be withdraw charges and you might lose tax benefits.To avoid needing to use your retirement fund, set up an emergency savings account. Most financial professional suggest saving 3 to 6 months' worth of after-tax income in a savings account for emergencies.

, You'll need to form a retirement budget if you want to retire with security. Take into account how much money is coming in, how much you have in savings, and how much debt you'll be in, if any.Financial planners generally recommend a retirement income equal to 75 to 80 percent of pre-retirement income.


For example, if you make $80,000 before retirement, you will need between $60,000 and $64,000 for each year of retirement.
Track your income and expenses for a couple of months to keep track of how much money you generally spend. You can find calculators online to help you estimate things like pension cost and 401(K) benefits through websites like the IRS and AARP.If you have any debt, such as a mortgage, take monthly payments into consideration. Using all this information, get a sense of roughly how much you should spend each month., You may have a variety of non-traditional assets you could use to fund your retirement. Do you collect old cars or antiques? Do you have any other collections that may have appreciated in value? You may also have skills you can make use of after retirement to make some extra money. You could teach music lessons, for example, if you're skilled at the piano., If you think you'll need to rely on social security payments after retirement, look into when you should start collecting. The amount of money you'll get from social security depends on your age, financial status, and other factors. For the most part, the longer you wait to claim benefits the better they'll be. You can use the AARP's Social Security Benefits Calculator to get a better sense of when you should begin collecting.Coordinate with your spouse's benefits to maximize your total benefits. The best strategy here will depend your preretirement earnings and retirement needs.
For example, a higher-earning spouse can file for benefits at an early age (before 70) and then suspend them, allowing the other spouse to earn spousal benefits while not reducing their own benefits.Be sure to research any possible changes in SS rules and benefits.

, If you plan to support your children through college, you'll need incorporate saving for this expense into your overall saving plan. Like with retirement, it's best to start contributing to a college fund early on. Every state offers 529 ""qualified tuition program"" plans that provides tax benefits and investment plans to help parents save for college. Meet with a qualified financial advisor to set up a 529 plan and assess the amount of money you might need to cover future college expenses.


While college expenses can be paid for with your retirement fund, there are always options, including work-study programs and student loans. Any money you take out of your retirement account is money not earning interest that will eventually be used to support you in retirement., You'll want to make sure you're in good health prior to retirement. Some simple preventative care can go a long way to a happy, secure retirement.


Before you retire, make sure you're up to date on all annual screenings. It's a good idea to do a number of health exams, recommended for someone your age, if your insurance coverage will run out with retirement. Even with new insurance, your coverage might not be as good as it was previously.Refill any prescriptions that will no longer be covered. If you have dental insurance, get a dental exam and get any work you need.You should also figure out where your new health care will come from. At 65, you're eligible for Medicare. Look into applying the plans that work for you. Keep in mind if your children are under 26, they won't be covered by Medicare even if you are enrolled.There are Medigap insurance plans for non-covered expenses, such as copayments and deductibles on treatment. These plans are sold by private companies and require that you first have Medicare Parts A and B.There is a high probability that Medicare rules and benefits may be changed in coming years, so keep yourself abreast of changes that might apply to you.

, Know what your housing situation will be before you retire. If you plan on taking out a mortgage, keep in mind it will be more difficult to apply when you're retired. One benefit to a mortgage, however, is that typically, rates are fixed. Rent, on the other hand, fluctuates with time.Some people plan to have their home paid off by the time they retire for a reduction in expenses as well as peace of mind.


For those who have significant equity in home and no desire to pass physical assets to someone, reverse mortgages can be a way to gain additional financing for your retirement.
Reverse mortgages allow homeowners to convert their equity into cash payments and are available to those over the age of 62.For more on reverse mortgages, see how to get a reverse mortgage.

, Long-term care insurance (LTCI) provides coverage to policyholders in the event that they need long-term care in their old age. That is, if you need to be placed in a nursing home or hire a full-time nurse for your home, LTCI will cover these (general quite large) expenses. However, coverage comes at a steep price, as premiums may run as high as $3,000 per year even for health 50-year olds. Despite the expense, LTCI can be a good way to cover your care in old age and preserve your remaining assets for your children.


LTCI is a good investment if you are too wealthy to qualify for Medicaid (if you possess total assets, including you home, of more than $50,000 in most cases) but not wealthy enough to pay for your own care outright.
Experts advise buying LTCI around your early to mid-fifties., Prepaying funeral expenses can save your family from having to come up with this cost. Prepaid plans are available from funeral homes and may be paid in full or in installments. Make sure to get an itemized list of services included so get the services you want. Then, comparison shop between funeral homes in your area to make sure you're getting the best value for your money.


You can also consider cheaper options like cremation or save for funeral expenses on your own., Retirement can be an emotional time. It's a difficult transition as so much of our personal sense of fulfillment and social relationships are tied to work. Take some time preparing for this transition.


More and more people are reducing hours over time rather than abruptly retiring from full time to retired. This can ease the transition, help keep you intellectually engaged, and help fund your retirement.
Make a retirement plan for yourself outlining specific things you want to do. For example, write something like ""I want to volunteer working with children at least 2 times a week."" It might be a good idea to have a few trips planned ahead of time so you don't grow bored or frustrated in retirement.Make sure you find ways to stay connected with friends and family. If your social interactions mostly come from work, try joining clubs and organizations designed for the recently retired. If you don't have a Facebook page, it might be a good time to set one up. You can stay in touch with work acquaintances and friends online.

Remember to eat well. Eat at least five portions of fruit or vegetables every day. Also remember to eat iron-rich foods, such as lean red meat.Exercise is also vital. You won’t magically become active once you retire. Instead, you need to build an active lifestyle now, while you are still working. However, you should find exercise that doesn’t stress your joints too much. Consider swimming or bicycling over jogging.;
, Soon, you’ll be living off your investments. However, do you know all of the accounts you have? For example, don’t forget Social Security benefits, old 401(k) accounts from previous employers, etc. You’ll need to sit down and get organized.If you’ve lost track of retirement accounts, call old employers and ask if you had any account with them.
Also create a spreadsheet of accounts, PINs, and beneficiaries. People will need to know this information in case you become incapacitated at some point.

, You should have begun financial planning for retirement when you were much younger. In your 60s, you need to regularly reassess your investments to make sure you have the right allocation mix.Consider whether you want to merge accounts so that it is easier to withdraw income from them. Now is the time to rollover an IRA or your employer-sponsored retirement plan.
If you’re married, remember to come to an agreement with your spouse about investment priorities. It’s better to deal with these issues now than when you are retired.

, Women have slightly different retirement considerations than men. As a woman, you’ll need to consider the following:How to get sufficient income in retirement. On average, women earn a third less than men, which means they usually have less saved.
How you’ll be taken care of in very-old age. Women live about two years longer than men. If your male partner is five years older than you, chances are he’ll die seven years before you do.
How being single in your later years will impact your taxes. As a single person, your tax burden will typically be higher.
How you will absorb higher medical costs. Women are more likely to suffer from a chronic or terminal illness, so you need to plan for those expenses.

, Don’t wait until the day of your retirement party to come up with a list of things to do. Spend free time mapping out the first few years of your retirement. Do you want to travel? Improve your golf game? Go back to college to get that degree in English literature you’ve always wanted?


Come up with a list so that you can budget for these expenses.You might find that you don’t have the money to do everything that you want to do.

, You need to turn your investments into an income stream during your retirement years. You have options. Meet with a financial planner to discuss how you can stretch your savings for as long as possible. Also, discuss how you much income you will need at each stage of your retirement.


One strategy is to simply withdraw money from your account whenever you need it. If you have sufficient savings, you can withdraw only income without touching the capital. However, you might not have saved enough, so you must draw down capital as well.You can also withdraw amounts systematically. For example, you might withdraw four percent a year.
Discuss whether an annuity makes sense. For a lump sum, you buy a contract with an insurance company and receive monthly payments.

, People are most active in the first few years of retirement. With all of this free time, you will be tempted to travel to all of those places you were too busy to visit. Accordingly, you might be tempted to blow most of your nest egg. Resist the temptation.Remember that this is your retirement savings you spent some much time building. It isn’t lottery winnings.
Don’t deprive yourself. If you’ve always wanted to visit Paris, now is the time to do so while you are still healthy. However, mix in inexpensive hobbies (such as hiking or bicycling) with more expensive ones.

, You might not want to give up work entirely. Instead, you could work part-time or in a consultancy role.You’ll still keep your mind sharp but enjoy the leisurely schedule.


Also try something new. The key to working in retirement is to find something that fits your schedule and is fun.If you’re dragging yourself to a part-time job, then you’re doing something wrong.

, If you love all of the unstructured free time, great! However, many retirees find themselves at sea with all of this time on their hands. In fact, they might even feel guilty that they aren’t using their free time productively.Create a mini work schedule. For example, schedule an hour for housework, an hour for errands, and then an hour for exercise.This routine provides enough structure so that you feel productive, but it also allows for plenty of free time.

, After the honeymoon period, you may begin to feel depressed, lonely, or bored.Once you’ve done everything on your bucket list, you’ll start to settle down. Naturally, you might feel disappointed or sad.


Seek help. You can find a mental health professional by contacting your health insurer.Make new friends. If all of your friends are still working, you’ll need to expand your social circle to meet new people who are also retired. Stop into your local retirement center or pursue hobbies like seminars and cooking classes., In your 70s, you might want to move into a home with only one floor.You should think about selling your home and moving into a more manageable space.


Research whether a retirement community is right for you. Retirement communities come in different shapes and sizes. For example, some communities are for people who can live independently in their own apartments.
However, assisted living communities provide support, such as help with meals or housework, for those who can’t be fully independent but don’t need to go into a nursing home., As you settle down, your expenses should become more predictable. However, unexpected expenses can still crop up. Because you might stop working even part-time during this phase, you need to carefully plan.


For example, you might need to pay for a major home repair if you still own your home. Fixing your roof can cost several thousand dollars.Even if you have health insurance, you’ll still need to cover dental and vision care. Depending on where you live, you may also need to cover nursing home costs.

, So much of who we are is tied up in our jobs and families. However, as you move into your 70s and 80s, you’ll probably stop all part-time work. Also, your family members are busy living their own lives. Accordingly, you’ll need to build a new identity.You can volunteer one day a week or join other social activities. It’s important to meet new people who will view you in your new identity. If you were a former lawyer, you’ll be held back if you only socialize with those who knew you in your old job.Also focus on just “being.” Practice mediation or yoga to gain a sense of self that isn’t tied to a job or other social role.

, You need to put a final estate plan in place before you begin to slow down mentally. Accordingly, you should review your estate plan and revise it if necessary. Meet with an estate planning attorney.


Remember to rearrange your estate plan if you sell large assets. For example, you might have divided your assets equally between your children. If you sell your home, your estate plan is now unbalanced.
Also draft a living will and a durable medical power of attorney if you don’t already have them. With a living will, you spell out what kind of treatment you want in case you become incapacitated. Because you can’t anticipate all situations, you should also appoint an agent with a durable medical power of attorney. This agent makes decisions for you when you are no longer able to., At this stage of retirement, you’ll begin to spend more time going to the doctor and managing your health problems. If you have a spouse or partner, you’ll need to manage their health problems as well.You need to make informed medical decisions.Find a doctor who can explain things clearly to you.

, If you are no longer able to meet your daily needs, you might need to move into an assisted living facility or a nursing home. Research facilities and pay particular attention to how you can pay. Some assisted living facilities, for example, accept Medicaid., You might outlive your retirement savings or suffer serious setbacks. Now is the time to reach out for help. If your family can’t help you, then research what government assistance is available.


For example, many local governments have heat assistance that will help you in the winter.
You might also get meals through the Meals on Wheels program or through the federal Commodity Supplemental Food Program., With declining health, you might not be able to enjoy your regular activities—golf, tennis, travel. However, you can still stay physically and mentally active.


Get a scooter so that you can get around. There’s no reason to stay locked up in your house if you don’t have to.
Read the newspaper to stay in touch with the world. E-readers are great for the elderly because you can increase the text size of anything you are reading.

, It’s never too early to prepare. Spend a few minutes each day thinking about whether this is your last day. Then ask yourself if there’s anything you need to do or say. Make the time to cross off everything on your list.Reflect on your life and everything you have learned. Keep a journal to record your thoughts. It will make a wonderful gift to your family when you are gone.

Relocation consultants or specialists exist that can help you with all the details your personal situation requires. Do keep in mind, however, that hiring a consultant or specialist will add to your retirement expenses, but in the long-run, it may be money well spent.To find a consultant or specialist, start with a search on the internet.
You can use sites like Google or Yelp to read reviews and ratings from previous customers to determine if a particular consultant or specialist would be recommended.
Word of mouth referrals are also a great way to find someone. If you know other people who have retired to Mexico already, ask them to recommend a consultant or specialist that they had a good experience with.
Some consultants offer fixed fee services where they’ll only spend a specific amount of time on your situation and complete a specific list of items. If you need more help, or have a lot of questions, the cost for a consultant may be more expensive.;
, The cost to retire is different for everyone and depends on a number of individual factors such as: the type of accommodation you want to live in; whether you want to hire service companies to do housework or yard work for you; how much you want to dine out and what types of entertainment you want to enjoy; and so on. While it may seem cheaper, based on stereotypes, to retire in Mexico, that is not always the reality.You can approach your finances from two perspectives:

Perspective 1: Review your retirement savings to determine how much money you have to spend on an annual basis. Then, work to find a lifestyle in Mexico that falls within this budget.
Perspective 2: Research how much everything will cost you to retire in Mexico (rent, utilities, food, insurance, etc.) and then determine how much money you need every year to live that lifestyle.


If you find that your retirement savings aren't enough to meet your estimated expenses, you can either continue to work until you’ve saved enough money, or you can look for alternatives that are less expensive.
Don’t forget to also budget for possible emergencies, especially if those emergencies will require you to travel back to your home country on short notice.

, Depending on your financial situation, you may want to hire an accountant or tax specialist to help you prepare your taxes. One thing you need to consider is double-taxation. If you have any kind of income (including investment income) in your home country, you will need to determine if you need to pay tax in both countries, or only one.Mexico does have double-taxation agreements with countries like the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and some other European countries.
If your home country has a double-taxation agreement with Mexico, you will only have to pay tax in one country. Your tax specialist or accountant will help you determine in which country you should pay your taxes.
Keep in mind that tax laws are constantly changing and you need to keep yourself up-to-date.
You may also need to enlist the help of an accountant in Mexico to assist you with Mexican tax rules and regulations.

, Mexico has both Immigrant and Non-Immigrant permits for foreigners. Immigrant Permits are for foreigners who wish to live long-term in Mexico. Non-Immigrant Permits are for foreigners visiting Mexico for a limited period of time. You will need to decide which permit is best for you. You may also wish to consult an immigration expert before you make a decision., There are two types of Non-Immigrant Permits. One permit, called the Vistante, is for foreigners staying in Mexico for 6 months or less. The other permit, called the Visa de Residente Temporal, is for foreigners who want to live in Mexico for longer than 6 months but less than 4 years.The Vistante cannot be renewed and must be applied for in-person when you arrive in Mexico.
The Visa de Residente Temporal can be renewed, but only for a maximum of 4 years. It must be applied for before you arrive in Mexico.

, Immigrant permits, also known as the Visa de Residente Permanente, are intended for foreigners who want to live permanently in Mexico. In order to qualify for this type of via, you need to meet one of the following criteria:You must have close family connections in Mexico, or
You must apply for retirement status and show you have enough money to sustain yourself in Mexico, or
You’ve had a Temporary Resident status for 4 years already, or
You’ve had a Temporary Resident status for at least 2 years due to marrying a Mexican citizen or permanent resident, or
You’ve been granted residency because of humanitarian grounds or because of political asylum.
A new points systems was introduced in 2016 that will determine your eligibility. Information about this points system will eventually be available online.

, If you have health or dental insurance in the United State or Canada (including government-funded health care), it is unlikely that you will be able to take advantage of it while living in Mexico. All medical facilities in Mexico are private and medical care usually needs to be paid in full at the time of service. It is important that you obtain the proper type of health insurance to cover anyone living in Mexico.Health insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain, and more expensive, after you turn 65. However this is generally the same in most countries, not just Mexico.
Shop around for Mexican health insurance and obtain multiple quotes before making a final decision.
Make sure your health insurance is in place before you cross the border into Mexico. If you need medical care after you’ve entered Mexico, but before you’ve purchased insurance, an insurance plan will not cover the costs retroactively.
Note that permanent residents of Mexico (i.e. foreigners who have the Visa de Residente Permanente) can have their healthcare subsidized by the Mexican government, which will make it much more affordable than the US.

, Mexico offers a retirement savings program for those who are 60 years of age or older and those who have a permanent resident visa (i.e. the Visa de Residente Permanente). Enrolling in this program will provide you with a number of discounts on things like: doctor and dentist visits; hospital visits; medical lab work; prescription drug; cultural activities; transportation; and hotels. If you qualify for this program, sign-up as soon as you can so you can enjoy the associated benefits., The banking system in Mexico has improved significantly over the last decade and internet banking is now widely available. It is a good idea to open a bank account in Mexico, but also to keep a bank account in your home country (if regulations allow).Note that the process to open a new bank account at a Mexican bank is quite involved and may take a while. Don’t expect to drop into a bank for a few minutes in order to open a new account.
The majority of Mexicans still prefer to do their banking in the branch with a teller. This means that at certain times on certain days the line at the bank can be rather long.

, Living in Mexico will be different from living in the United States or Canada. If you aren’t ready for big changes and new adventures, relocating to Mexico might be somewhat of a culture shock. Also keep in mind that living in Mexico on a full-time basis will be much different than visiting Mexico on vacation., In general the cost of living in Mexico will be less expensive than living in the United States or Canada.Groceries, especially fruits and vegetables, are less expensive and fresher than you’ll find in the US or Canada.
Public transportation and domestic flights are less expensive, or getting less expensive.
Some utilities, like electricity, can be more expensive than the US or Canada, unless you pay attention to your consumption.
Water is less expensive, but not always of good quality. Most Mexicans opt to buy and use bottled water rather than use tap water. Bottled water in Mexico is much more expensive than it is in the US or Canada.
Items like clothes, electronics, appliances, etc., are more expensive in Mexico than in the US or Canada. Depending on the regulations regarding importing these items, you may want to purchase some of these things before you move.
Cars are more expensive in Mexico.
Gasoline costs are regulated by the government, not by the oil market. While this means they do not fluctuate as much as in the US or Canada, they may be more expensive.
Rent in Mexico is fairly equivalent to what you’d find in the US. Areas with more foreigners will be more expensive, areas with more locals will be less expensive.

, Retirees move to Mexico on either a full-time or part-time basis. Part-time residents usually own a home in their home country and either own or rent a home in Mexico. These same part-time residents may live in their home country for the summer months and then move to Mexico for the winter months.Whether you want to move to Mexico on a part-time or a full-time basis may depend upon your family connections in your home country. You may wish to spend half the year in your home country in order to see your children or grandchildren regularly.
If you choose to live in Mexico on a part-time basis, you may also need to decide what you want to do with any property you own when you’re not living in it. You can either keep it empty and pay minimal utilities and the associated insurance. Or you can consider renting out the property when you are not there.
If you decide to rent one of your properties when you’re not using it, you may wish to consider hiring a property management company. Considering you will be quite far away, you may not be able to handle all the landlord-related duties personally.

, When visiting Mexico on vacation and staying on resort properties, your safety is pretty much guaranteed. Venturing outside the resort areas will be a little different and not all areas of Mexico are equally safe. Make sure you do your research regarding the safety of the different areas you want to live in, especially the safety of these areas for foreigners.A great place to start your research is on the United States Passport and International Travel website for the US Department of State. The website has details on the safety of the states and cities within Mexico for foreign travellers.
The website can be found at http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/mexico-travel-warning.html.

, Both renting and owning property in Mexico is an option. Rental costs are pretty similar to those in the United States and Canada, depending on the location. And renting may give you more flexibility to move locations on shorter notice if you don’t like the house or location where you’ve rented.Buying property in Mexico is somewhat similar to buying property in the US or Canada. Costs are fairly inexpensive, although it depends on the specific area.
If you do decide to buy property in Mexico, make sure to consider not only the location but the local infrastructure and amenities.
Note that Mexico has restricted zones within 100 kilometres of the US border and within 50 kilometres of the coast. While foreigners are able to own property in these restricted areas, the property must be purchased through a land trust.
You do not need to have resident status in Mexico to own property.
Financing property in Mexico is not only more difficult than in the US and Canada, it is significantly more expensive. While it is possible to get a mortgage through a Mexican bank, you may want to consider purchasing the property without financing to avoid the extra expense and hassle.
If you buy property in Mexico you will need to work with a Notary Public. A Notary Public in Mexico is not the same as a Notary in other countries. In Mexico, Notary Publics are appointed by the State government. They have extensive education and work experience, and are required to pass a certification exam.

, One of the best ways to reduce your expenses in Mexico is to find out how the locals live and where they shop. Mexico has a large tourist industry which can significantly increase the costs of average items like groceries. As someone living in Mexico on retirement savings, you want to be sure your paying the same prices for things as the locals, not the tourists."

That includes the field you'd like to work in and your potential job title.Ideally, you may wish to return to your previous field in a similar job. However, you may have to look into related or totally new fields if you can't break back into your previous line of work.


Decide what type of hours you'd like to work and what kind of schedule you'd be comfortable with.
You may need to be more flexible, depending on the job market in your area and how immediate your financial needs are.
You may prefer a regular 9:00 to 5:00 schedule, but you might have a better chance getting a job that requires late or overnight shifts if there are a lot of applicants for daytime shifts.;
, If you cannot get back into your previous industry, you may want to look into industries that are specifically known for hiring workers that are age 50 or older.There are many options, though which one you choose may depend on your experience, your financial needs, and the job market in your area.


Retail businesses frequently hire workers of all ages, including workers over 50. Applying with a retailer you visit frequently can further improve your chances of getting hired.The elder care industry is notable for its lack of age bias/discrimination. Working in the elder care industry can also bring a great sense of fulfillment.
The wealth management/banking industry frequently hires workers over age 50.
Many workers over 50 years of age find work as a tour guide. It may be seasonal work in some places, but it allows you to get involved with a place you're interested in.Driving can be a fun and lucrative job, if your license and insurance are valid.You can apply for work driving a shuttle or bus, or try a driver service like Uber or Lyft.

, Your financial situation may be one of the greatest determining factors when you search for jobs. If you're fairly secure with your savings and other sources of income like Social Security, then you may not need to worry as much about how much a given job would pay. However, if you're struggling to make ends meet, you'll need to find a job that pays a wage you can live comfortably off of.Calculate your monthly expenses, including housing and mortgage costs, utilities, transportation, food and entertainment expenses, and any medical bills you pay.
Calculate your monthly income, including Social Security benefits, retirement plans, and investment income.
Don't forget to calculate your monthly expenses and your monthly income after taxes, not before. This will help give you a more accurate picture of your financial situation.The difference between your monthly expenses and your monthly income is called your income gap. You'll want a job that pays at least as much as your income gap so you'll be more financially secure.

, Working after retirement can be enjoyable and highly rewarding. However, there are also certain downsides that can come with returning to work after retirement, and the risks need to be weighed against the benefits.Returning to work could negatively affect your pension, which is calculated based on your salary in the years prior to retirement. If you resume working and then permanently retire later, it could result in a lower pension payout.
Going back to work can potentially cut into your family and vacation time. As a new employee, you may be expected to pick up swing shifts, holidays, and other undesirable work blocks.

, Returning to work has many potential benefits. If you're considering going back to work, it may be worth looking further into how a regular work schedule could benefit you.If you retire before age 65, you will not yet qualify for Medicare. By returning to work until you're at least 65, you'll be able to get health coverage through your employer, or at least be able to pay for healthcare more easily.
By returning to work, you can increase your monthly income to help pay for any expenses and build a savings for the future.
Returning to work will also allow you to spend more time out of the house. This can generally help you have a normal schedule and a sense of purpose, which some individuals lose after retiring.

, There are many ways to find job openings in your field or any other field of work. If you don't have any leads you can search online for openings in your area. However, a more secure approach may be to seek out jobs through your connections.Networking can help you find work in your field. Prepare a 30-second ""elevator pitch"" that summarizes who you are, what you've done, and what you'd like to continue doing.
Reach out to former colleagues and professional acquaintances/associates. Let them know you're looking for work, but don't ask for a job; instead, ask about their professional experiences and how to break back into the field.
Consider reaching out to the hiring managers and department heads at your old job. Let these individuals know that you're interested in project assignments and more steady work.Don't be afraid to search outside your industry in a related field (with similar skill sets). You may also want to consider ""starter"" and as-needed positions, like a consultant.

, Having an online presence can help prevent employers from engaging in ageism, as you'll seem by all accounts to be a contemporary working individual.That said, there are some online platforms that are more helpful than others, and it's important to maintain a professional appearance online as well as in real life.Build your professional network on sites like LinkedIn. This can help highlight your professional experience and the scope of your colleague support.
Make sure your social media accounts have privacy settings in place that won't let potential employers see what you've posted. Or, at the very least, make sure you haven't posted anything offensive or overly-controversial.
You can clean up your social media accounts using specialized apps like Social Sweepster, which delete posts that could potentially ruin your employment chances.Consider removing your age from your networking and social media accounts. That way potential employers won't actually know how old you are.

, Your resume is the first thing an employer sees, and it could be what makes or breaks your chances for an interview. Make sure there are no significant gaps in your resume (or explain any gaps that may be problematic), and be sure to list your work experience and education in reverse-chronological order (most recent first).Choose a traditional, easy-to-read font like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman.
Use a normal font size as well: either 10-point or 12-point is ideal, though you can go up to size 14 or 15 for your name to make it stand out.
Include your contact information at the top of the page (including a URL for your LinkedIn page, if you have one).
Restrict your resume to one or two pages. Your resume should highlight your qualifications, not tell your entire life story.

, In addition to your resume, your cover letter essentially sells you to the potential employer. It's your place to elaborate on what your resume summarizes. It's also a good opportunity for you to convey your personality and overall career accomplishments to an employer. It's worth taking the extra time to compose a strong, compelling cover letter to accompany your resume.


Check for spelling and syntax errors. These can quickly turn off an employer, as they may look unprofessional.
Use some of the key words and phrases that the employer used in the job advertisement. Don't pull entire sentences, but incorporate certain terms (like ""management of personnel"" instead of ""director of personnel"").Make sure your cover letter has an opening paragraph explaining who you are and why you're interested in/qualified for the job. Your closing paragraph should politely request an interview or follow-up of some type.The body of your cover letter, which comes between the opening and closing paragraphs, should highlight and expand on some of your resume's most compelling points.

, In addition to polishing your resume and cover letter to keep them up to date and accurate, you'll also want to make changes to reduce the chances you'll be discriminated against over your age. This includes making your supporting materials look as contemporary as possible and avoiding direct giveaways about how long you've been working in your field.


Make sure your email address is normal and through a contemporary server like Gmail.Only highlight the last 10 to 15 years of work experience.Rather than discussing your other years of experience, you should focus on your professional skills and achievements., A job interview is a sort of performance. As such, you'll want to make sure you dress the part for the role you want to obtain. Some companies have a more casual approach to work apparel, but it's best to err on the side of caution and dress for success.A 40 year old suit may make you look out of touch with other contemporary job seekers.
Opt for modern-styled clothing: a slimmer cut suit for men, and a modern blouse and skirt or pant suit (without shoulder pads) for women.
Make sure your hairstyle, makeup, and fragrance (or absence of fragrance) are appropriate for both the industry and the position you're trying to enter., One of the best ways to prepare for a job interview is to do your research. The interviewer will meet with dozens of other candidates, so knowing a lot about the company will show your dedication and help you stand out.At the very least, you should know about the company's history and the details of the particular position you're applying for.
Know and be able to smoothly incorporate relevant facts and statistics. However, make sure you incorporate that information in a relevant way so it doesn't look like you're just dropping facts.
You may want to go even deeper and research the company's earnings, quarterly reports, and blog posts. This will give you a better sense of where the company stands and where it hopes to move in the future.
Be able to converse comfortably about what the company is doing and why you think you'd be a good fit.

, The worst thing you can do at a job interview is show up late. No one likes to be kept waiting, but arriving too early could make it seem like you're overcompensating for punctuality problems. It's best to be there a little early without imposing on the receptionist, and make sure you have everything you'll need.Plan to be in the office and waiting for your interview at least five minutes ahead of time. That means parking and walking to the building at least 15 to 20 minutes early.
Bring at least one hard copy of your resume, even if you already submitted one electronically.
You should also bring a pen, notebook, and a list of questions to ask the interviewer after they're finished asking you questions.
Some people like to bring a small water bottle tucked away in a briefcase or purse to prevent dry mouth. However, don't bring coffee or any obvious beverage in-hand, as this may look unprofessional.

, While the resume and cover letter are what can get your foot in the door, the interview is where you really sell yourself to the employer. You'll need to be polite and respectful, and you'll want to try and balance confidence with some degree of humility. In other words, be confident without being cocky, and always maintain a professional demeanor before, during, and after the actual interview.Answer questions honestly but completely. Talk each answer out a bit so that the interviewer gets a clear picture of your thought process.
If you're not sure of anything, don't lie about it. Tell the interviewer honestly that you're not sure, or say something like, ""That wasn't really something I dealt with. My primary responsibilities were ____.""
Anticipate that you'll be asked what your greatest weakness is. Make sure your answer shows how you've attempted to overcome your weakness.
For example, you might say something like, ""In the past I've struggled to maintain some of my employees' punctuality, but after implementing new office procedures I was able to improve both punctuality and performance.""
At the end of the interview, the interviewer should ask you if you have any questions. Bring your prepared notes and ask about the company, what your position would entail, and any other relevant questions you may have.

, You may see your years of experience as a strong point, but if you're worried about ageism it could create problems to reveal how long you've been working. Rather than discussing how much experience you have, focus on the things you've managed to accomplish during those years of experience.Highlight your skills and the significant accomplishments of your career.
Learn the contemporary terms and jargon relevant to the field. Industry terms may have changed since you last worked that job.
If the interviewer asks if you're overqualified, spin your answer by focusing on why you're interested in this job/employer at this stage of your professional career.
If the interviewer asks about gaps in your resume, spin your answer by talking about how raising a family, caring for a loved one, or volunteering during your time out of work helped you develop applicable skills.
In the event that the interviewer asks about your ability to work for someone younger than you, talk about your ability to work with people from all age levels. Highlight specific instances from your recent employment.

, Depending on the position and the company you interview for, there may be a handful of other candidates or there could be dozens. Either way, you'll want to set yourself apart from the rest as a professional and a likable individual. The best way to do this is to follow up with a polite and respectful message.If you had a phone interview, send a quick email expressing your thanks and reiterating your interest in the position. Be sure to mention the interviewer, the position, and the company all by name.
For an in-person interview, jot down each individual's name who interviewed you and one or two key questions they asked. Send a hand-written thank-you note to each person.
Be sure your thank you-note addresses each interviewer by name and the main topic they brought up.
For example, your note may read, ""Dear Andrew, thank you for the enjoyable conversation on quality control last Tuesday. Looking forward to continuing the discussion in the future and learning more about the company.""

Calculate how much savings and income you’ll have.,
Don’t count on receiving Medicare abroad.,
Research local medical care and costs.,
Look into establishing residency.,
Consider part-time residency.,
Apply for a permanent residence visa.,
Avoid double taxation abroad.,
Talk the decision through with your family.,
Look for a country with pleasant weather.,
Compare the costs of living in countries you’re considering retiring to.,
Visit the country before you move there.",How to Retire Abroad," Prior to any substantial planning for moving abroad, you’ll need to calculate finances. An easy way to do this is to break down projected monthly income: how much you’ll receive from a retirement annuity, plus any income you have from pensions, Social Security, and investments.Keep in mind that, if you’re concerned that you won’t have enough income to live comfortably abroad, you could pick up a part-time job in the country you retire to.


You should also look into local exchange rates in countries you’re considering moving to; you may be surprised (whether pleasantly or unpleasantly) at the value your native currency gains or loses.;
, If you’re an American senior over 65 years of age, you’re eligible to receive Medicare in the United States. However, Medicare benefits do not apply overseas, so you’ll be cut off from this resource if you retire abroad.Seniors who are considering retiring abroad initially before returning to the United States for their final years will be able to receive Medicare, but will have a premium 10% higher for every 12-month period they were not enrolled.Unlike Medicare, other senior financial programs do not require you to live in the United States. For example, Social Security will continue to pay a retirement annuity if you retire abroad. Confirm this by contacting the Social Security Office of Earnings and International Operations., Seniors often need to receive extensive health care after retirement, and without the benefit of Medicare, have three primary options. Seniors can purchase an international health insurance policy, purchase a health insurance policy in the country they retire to, or pay for all health-care expenses out of pocket.Paying out of pocket is not necessarily a bad option; many foreign countries have relatively inexpensive health care (Especially in comparison to the U.S.) and so you may be able to save money by not purchasing health insurance.
Finally, in nations with socialized health care, you won’t need to worry about health insurance at all.

, If you’ll be living as an expatriate permanently, you’ll need to establish residency within the country you move to. This can be a complicated process, and it’s a factor that can strongly influence your choice of retirement destination. Most countries welcome foreign retirees, and some only require that you own property to qualify for residency. Many other nations require you to earn a specific amount of monthly income to become a resident.For example, Panama’s pensionado plan requires retired seniors to have a monthly income of $1,000 (including Social Security) in order to qualify for residency. On a similar type of plan, Ecuador requires an income of $800 a month, and Nicaragua and Columbia each require over $600 a month.Certain countries—including Ecuador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic—offer residency to immigrants who are willing to make a financial investment in the nation., If the country you plan to retire to has a prohibitive residency policy—for example, they require residents to earn a monthly income that you can’t achieve—you can skirt this issue by only retiring part-time. This means that you would live abroad for a portion of the year (say, 6 months) and live in your native country for the remainder of the year.This allows you to maintain residency in your native country while still being able to spend substantial time retired abroad.

, In some cases, a foreign government will require non-native residents—including senior-age retirees—to obtain a residence visa. This document functions similarly to other types of visa, and gives you legal permission to reside in a country that you have emigrated to. Residence visas are often initially given for a brief period of time (e.g. two years) which can later be extended as needed.Be sure to check with the State Department of nations that you’re considering retiring to, and ask about their residence visa policies. Some countries may have more stringent requirements than others.
Some nations that do not require visitors to hold a visa will require one of even temporary residents.

, Regardless of where you retire to abroad, you’ll still need to pay income tax to the American government. American retirees looking for lower taxation abroad are often disappointed when they find that their new residency status does not result in a lowering of taxes. In order to avoid being taxed by the American government and a foreign government (i.e. double taxation), consider moving to a country such as Mexico or Canada that has a standing tax treaty with the U.S. to prohibit double taxation.Even if you plan to relinquish your American citizenship—an uncommon move—or move your financial assets to a foreign country, the U.S. government has laws in place which force you to continue paying income tax.
Retirees from other countries will likely still be taxed by their respective native governments, and would need to contact their nation’s State Department for further information.

, On a personal level, you may want to seek out the opinion and approval of your family before making the decision to move abroad, especially if you have siblings or children you’d like to stay in touch with. Retiring abroad can be an isolating experience for you (and your partner, if you’re not retiring alone), and it’s important to have the support of family members and close friends during this transition.Also bear in mind that moving from a familiar culture to a foreign one can be a challenging experience, especially if you haven’t traveled abroad much before. Prepare yourself for this culture shock by making smaller trips in advance of your retirement, and reading as much as possible about the culture you’ll be retiring into.

, Many retirees want to live comfortably after they retire, and value mild, warm weather as part of that comfortable living. To this end, many expatriate retirees relocate to the Caribbean, which has warm summers, mild winters, and miles of sandy coast. For North American expatriates looking to live further abroad, Chiang Mai, Thailand offers a pleasant climate and low healthcare expenses.Parts of Western Europe are also becoming increasingly affordable for expatriate retirees, including Valencia, Spain, where residents can find a decently sized apartment for around $400 a month.
Many South American options have mild weather and cultures friendly to foreign retirees, including Buenos Aires, Argentina, and the country of Guatemala., This is another major decision which can strongly influence expatriate retirees’ location. If you choose to retire to a nation with lower cost of living and a financial exchange rate that will benefit your native currency, you can live comfortably on substantially less money than you might need in your native country. For example, Mexico has an exchange rate that favors the dollar. Panama also has a low cost of living, especially for American expatriates as do South American countries like Belize and Peru.Keep in mind that, even if the cost of living in a foreign country is lower that it would be at home, you’ll still be faced with the cost of relocation, plus amenities such as electricity, cell phone bills, and transportation. These factors could cost more abroad., This is especially important if you’ve never before visited a country you’re planning to retire to, or have visited only briefly. Retirees often live two or three decades after they retire, so you’ll be spending many years in whichever country you choose. To make sure that you’ll enjoy your retirement, take a lengthy trip—at least a month—to the country and investigate living in local communities.If you’re planning well in advance, you could even rent a small house or apartment in the country, and give yourself a 6-month trial run. If you still enjoy the country after that time, then continue with the plan to retire abroad.

Know your retirement needs.,
Get out of debt.,
Create a savings plan.,
Contribute the full amount to your employer's matching program.,
Learn basic investment principles that can help you make the most of your retirement money, including creating a regular saving program, calculating your net worth and diversifying your investment portfolio to reduce your risk and increase your potential return.",How to Prepare a Retirement Plan," Most financial experts recommend saving 10 to 15 percent of your income for retirement, beginning when you are in your 20s. If you didn't begin to plan for your retirement that early, there are also many good retirement calculators available to help you determine what your specific saving needs might be. The final figure will probably be around 70 to 90 percent of your pre-retirement income, if you want to enjoy a similar standard of living throughout your life.;
, Pay off your credit cards and other consumer debt like car loans. Develop a plan for paying off your mortgage early. Pay cash for items whenever possible. If you can retire debt-free, you will need that much less to live on.

, Whether you put your money into a 401k, IRA or company pension plan, budget an amount each month that will go directly into your retirement investment. This amount should be based on your previous calculations that determine exactly how much you will need to live on after retirement. Taking the money out of your paycheck before it even reaches your checking account helps prevent the temptation to spend your retirement money on anything else.

, If your company matches funds you put into your retirement account, that is considered free money to be used after retirement. In addition, you will receive tax benefits on your own contributions into the retirement investment. A smart component of retirement planning is to take full advantage of this benefit. This will maximize your own retirement investment dollars right away.

, A big part of learning how to prepare a retirement plan is studying the various investment vehicles at your disposal to find the best ones for your budget and goals. These principles are best learned through an investment adviser who specializes in retirement planning, but you can find plenty of good information through the Internet as well.

While it is impossible to know, especially early on, when exactly you will retire, planning for a certain age can help guide your decisions. For Social Security purposes, your retirement age can be either be after or before your ""full"" retirement age. However, you will not receive any benefits until age 62.


Retiring past your full retirement age allows you to receive full Social Security benefits. Retiring at any point between 62 and your full retirement age slightly decreases your benefits, depending on how close your age is to 62.
Your full retirement age depends on the year of your birth. The Social Security Administration (SSA) provides a schedule for determining this age here: https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html.
The reductions in benefits are calculated such that the average beneficiary receives the same amount of total Social Security payments, regardless of when they retire.If in doubt, just use your full retirement age.;
, Although it may be unpleasant to think about, calculating your life expectancy is necessary to figure out how many years of retirement you will have to save for. According to the SSA, the average American male can expect to live to around age 84, while women can expect to reach 87. However, one in four (for both genders) will live past 90 and about ten percent will live to 95. Consider your own lifestyle choices and family history to make an assessment of how long you can expect to live., If you have not yet reached full retirement age and continue working, you may experience a reduction in Social Security benefits until you reach full retirement age. This depends on how much you make each year. However, after you reach full retirement age, there is no limit to how much you can make each year. Considering whether or not you will continue working after retirement can also factor into your deciding how much you need to save., Start by estimating the length of your retirement. This is just your estimated life expectancy minus your expected retirement age. So, for example, if you are planning to retire at 65 and are a male (life expectancy 85), you should plan for at least 20 years of retirement. From here, the standard rule of thumb is to multiply your annual income from before retirement by 70 percent to get your estimate retirement expenses. So, for example, if you made $60,000 before retirement, you would need $42,000 per year in retirement. So, for an expected 20 year retirement, you would need a total of 20*$42,000, or $840,000.


The percentage of your pre-retirement income may vary depending on how you plan to live after retirement. For example, 70 percent is satisfactory if you have your home paid for and are in good health. However, if you are unhealthy you may want to save more for medical costs.
Alternately, you may want to save more if you have more expensive goals for your retirement, like if you want to spend it traveling or build your dream home., Your actual benefit amounts will not be known until you apply for them. However, you can estimate your benefits if you are close to retirement by visiting the SSA's website and using their calculation tool. The tool can be found here: https://www.ssa.gov/retire/estimator.html. If you are younger, you can estimate your Social Security benefits using another calculator provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/retirement/before-you-claim/.


At any point before you retire, Social Security benefits could be reduced, increased, or eliminated. If at all possible, it's best to plan for retirement until the assumption that you may not receive these benefits.For example, imagine that you qualify for $2,000 per month in Social Security benefits. This would give you $24,000 per year and $480,000 over your estimated 20-year retirement. This would reduce your total amount needed for retirement from $840,000 to $360,000.

, Depending on your choices before retirement, you may receive income in retirement from company pensions or annuities you have purchased. Calculate how much you will receive from these benefits over the course of your retirement and subtract that amount from the total that you need for retirement.For example, if you expect to receive $6,000 per year from these payments, this would give you a total of 20*$6,000, or $120,000 over the course of your retirement. This would reduce your total required retirement amount to $240,000.

, Determine if you have any sources of passive income that you will continue to benefit from in retirement. These can include rental properties, royalties, dividend securities, and business investments. Add up the total value of these payments over your retirement years and subtract this figure from the total.

, Subtract your Social Security benefits, income from annuities, and passive income from your total retirement cost. This figure is how much you will need to save before retirement in order to meet your goals.Using the previous figures, you would need to save a total of $240,000 before retirement.

, Compound interest is a way to save money and have your savings work hard for you over the course of your working career. Compound interest is earned by most bank accounts and retirement accounts. Specifically, compound interest refers to a situation where interest is earned on the principal (initial investment) plus interest earned up to that point. This allows it to build value faster than simple interest, in which interest is only earned on the principal.For example, you can put away $1,000 per year for 30 years at 10% interest and have a nest egg of close to $200,000. You actually earned $170,000 on an investment of only $30,000. This is all due to the power of compounded interest.
Furthermore, if you put that $30,000 in all at once in the beginning of the 30-year period, your total would instead be about $525,000.

, Search online for a compound interest calculator with the option to add a monthly or annual contribution. Input a reasonable interest for the type of investment account you plan to use and how many years you have until retirement as the time limit. Then, play around with the initial deposit and monthly contributions until you reach your goal for retirement.


For example, make your initial deposit the amount of money you currently have to put into retirement and start with an initial monthly deposit of a small amount ($50 or $100). Work up the monthly deposit amount until you reach your goal.
You may find that you don't need to deposit much. A 25-year old that starts with $10,000 and deposits $100 per month until retirement at 65 will have over $550,000 by retirement.The interest rate that you use will depend on the nature of your investment account. However, for preliminary purposes use 8 percent. This number represents the average return you can expect from a diversified securities portfolio over time., Based on the monthly amount that you need to save, create a monthly budget that takes this amount into account. Even if you can't afford the full amount now, set aside what you can and put it into your retirement account. The important thing is to stick to your plan over the years until retirement, when it will all be worth it.Saving some now for retirement can make it easier to save more later. That is, the act of setting aside even $50 per month now can make it easier for you to remember and have the ability to put in $300 per month when you can afford it., Over time, you will advance in your career and pay off debts that you currently have. You can then contribute this additional money to your retirement account. Remember, there is no harm in contributing money above the amount that you originally calculated. Most people end up contributing the most to retirement in their fifties and early sixties, as other expenses are reduced.


An easy way to shift money into your retirement account to contribute more when your children leave home. After they have started supporting themselves, take the money you were spending to support them and put it into retirement. This way, you won't even notice the increase in savings (except in your account balance)., It may be tempting to reach into your retirement account for large purchases as the balance grows. However, any money you take out is money you can't have later and only reduces the amount of interest you can earn. In addition, any money taken out of the account is taxed as income as your standard tax bracket rate. Those under age 59.5 will also have to pay an additional 10 percent penalty on the withdrawal.


You can prevent having to use this account for emergency expenses by keeping an emergency account that contains at least six months' worth of living expenses.
You can prevent paying taxes on your retirement account when you switch jobs by rolling over the balance into a retirement account with your new employer., Many employers offer the benefit of 401(k) plans. These plans allow employees to put aside a percentage of their salary each pay period to invest in stocks, bonds and mutual funds. In addition, many larger companies offer matching plans. You personally contribute a set amount of money; let’s say 3% and your company will match that 3% with their own 3% (essentially free money). You should definitely take advantage of both employer 401K plans, as well as a company’s matching of funds.


Be sure to talk to your employer about the conditions of the 401(k) plan and matching, for example contribution/matching limits or time constraints., An IRA, or individual retirement account, is a type of account that can be used to easily save for retirement. You can contribute up to $5,500 per year to an IRA, and may be able to contribute up to $6,500 if you are over 50. Your contribution limit depends on your income, and some high-earning individuals or households may not qualify to contribute to an IRA at all. Talk to a financial professional about your options when selecting an IRA., If you change jobs, you may have a gap period in which you are unable to contribute to retirement or unable to qualify for the company plan at your new job. In this instances, work to still save the same amount you did before in an IRA or personal investment account. Any gaps just mean that you will have to contribute more to the account later in order to meet your goal., For younger investors, you have the option of investing in high risk vehicles. For instance, you can buy international stocks or purchase large amounts of small-cap stock (stock in small and growing companies). Because you have lots of time to grow your investments you won’t be completely devastated if your investments decline. For those that have built up a substantial nest egg and are close to retirement, your best bet is to stick with low to moderate investments; you don’t want to lose your entire retirement the year before you plan on retiring."

 Figure out how much you need to spend.,
 Consider changes in your lifestyle.,
 Calculate your annual income gap.,
 Calculate how much you will need to save.",How to Prepare for Retirement1," Many financial advisers use a rule of thumb for needed retirement income of 60 to 66 percent of current pretax income. However, this estimate is just a rule of thumb for an average case. To estimate your retirement expenses yourself, begin with a baseline, and then make adjustments. For your beginning baseline, start with your current monthly income.  This will give you an idea of how much you currently spend each month.  Then deduct expenses that you currently have that will disappear after retirement.For example, suppose your current monthly income is $5,000 after taxes.  Assume that your monthly expenses equal your monthly income, so begin with this number.

 Deduct your savings.  After retirement, you won’t be saving any more.  Suppose you save $500 each month.  Deduct that from your total.  $5,000−$500=$4,500{\displaystyle \$5,000-\$500=\$4,500}.

 Deduct how much you’ll save in living expenses if your home is paid off by the time you retire. For example, if you're paying $1,000 per month towards your home and it is paid off, you no longer have to pay that amount in retirement.$4,500−$1,000=$3,500{\displaystyle \$4,500-\$1,000=\$3,500}.
;
,  If you are going to travel, then some expenses might increase.  However, you might also decide you need to spend less on commuting, clothing and groceries.  Suppose you can reduce your monthly transportation, grocery and clothing budget by $300 per month.  But, you plan to take one large trip each year for $5,000, so you plan to save $450 per month for this trip.  The net change means adding $150 per month to your budget. $3,500+$150=$3,650{\displaystyle \$3,500+\$150=\$3,650}.,  Determine how much income you will receive from your current retirement savings, including Social Security, your pension and any retirement accounts you already have.  Compare that monthly income with your estimated monthly expenses.  Multiply that number by 12 to get your yearly income gap.Using the above example, you estimated that you will spend $3,650 each month in retirement.

 Suppose you know you will receive $1,100 from Social Security and $1,250 per month from your pension.  Your monthly income will be $1,100+$1,250=$2,350{\displaystyle \$1,100+\$1,250=\$2,350}.

 Your income gap is $3,650−$2,350=$1,300∗12=$15,600{\displaystyle \$3,650-\$2,350=\$1,300*12=\$15,600}.


,  Assume you will want to withdraw 4 percent from your retirement savings per year.  Multiply your annual income gap by 25 to estimate 25 years of living past retirement.  This will tell you how much more you need to save between now and retirement in order to have enough.In the above example, you annual income gap is $15,600.

 Multiply this by 25.  $15,600∗25=$390,000{\displaystyle \$15,600*25=\$390,000}.

 You need to save an additional $390,000 using retirement accounts such as a 401(k) or IRA. 

These numbers are rough estimates and presume no draw down of principal after retirement. 

You may have to adjust your calculations to include more years of retirement if your spouse is much younger than you are. 

Another option is purchase a lifetime annuity. These annuities can be purchased for a variety of amounts that provide different payouts as income each month or year for life. 

For example, an annuity to fill your $15,600 gap over your 25-year retirement would likely cost you about $160,000."

Find out how much money you need to retire.,
Add up your predicted retirement expenses to come up with an estimated annual budget that will need to be met in order to retire.

",How to Prepare for Early Retirement1," Take the following factors into consideration to calculate your retirement expenses.


Inflation rates: What is the predicted cost of living for the age when you plan to retire? The US Bureau of Labor Statistics and other governmental organizations publicly present annual reports to help you predict this cost.
Location: Living cost varies greatly due to differing tax rates, housing and daily household purchases depending on where you live after retirement.
Continuing Work: Do you plan to work after retirement? Having a part-time job after retirement not only helps you manage retirement costs but also gives you a healthy daily routine to fight boredom and lethargy.;

 Decide when to apply for Social Security benefits.,
Apply for benefits.,
Coordinate benefits for your spouse.,
 Provide the required documents.,
 Notify the Social Security Administration (SSA) of any changes that affect your benefits.",How to Prepare for Retirement2,"  The age at which you begin to collect Social Security benefits affects the percentage of benefits you will actually receive. Choosing the optimum age at which you should apply for benefits depends on many factors.  Consider your life expectancy and financial picture to decide how long to wait.Waiting until full retirement age allows you to collect 100 percent of your Social Security benefits.  If you were born before 1938, full retirement age is 65 years old.  For those born in 1938 and after, full retirement age can be up to 67 years of age.

 To determine your full retirement age, refer to the Social Security Administration’s retirement chart at https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html.

 If you can wait until age 70 to collect Social Security, you can collect an even higher monthly check.

For example, persons born after 1943 earn an increased benefit of 8 percent per year of deferral.



 You can begin collecting Social Security as young as age 62.  However, you will receive a permanently reduced amount.  If your full retirement age is 67 and you begin collecting at age 62, your benefit amount will be reduced by 30 percent.

 If you have other financial resources, it makes sense to delay collecting Social Security benefits until you are of full retirement age.

 If you will have high expenses in your retirement, such as if you devote much of your retirement income to an entrepreneurial goal or if you are in poor health, it may make more sense to begin collecting Social Security benefits at a younger age. This make sure that you have a steady enough income through this time to support your living expenses. 


,  Apply for your Social Security Benefits three months before you want them to begin.  You can choose to begin collecting Social Security before you stop working.  If your full retirement age is over the age of 65 and you want to wait to apply for Social Security, you should still apply for Medicare three months before your 65th birthday.You can apply for retirement benefits or Medicare online at https://secure.ssa.gov/iClaim/rib.

 To apply by phone, call 1-800-772-1213 or TTY 1-800-325-0778.

 To apply in person, visit your local Social Security office.  To find your local office, visit the website https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp and enter your zip code. 

 If you live outside of the United States, contact the nearest Social Security office, U.S. Embassy or consulate.  You can find the contact information by visiting https://www.ssa.gov/foreign/ .  


, If you have a spouse who has not worked enough to qualify for their own Social Security benefits, they may be able to qualify for spouse's benefits. These benefits follow the same age rules as regular benefits. That is, a qualifying spouse must be at least 62 years of age and will receive benefits at that age at a lower amount than they would at their full retirement age. Former spouses (from divorce) who were married to you at least 10 years may also be entitled to spouse's benefits.,  When you apply for Social Security benefits, you will need to provide documents to prove your identity.  The documents must be either original or certified by the issuing office.  You can mail them or personally bring them to your locally Social Security office.  The documents will be copied and returned to you. 

 If you don’t have all of the required documents, the people in the Social Security office can help you to get them.

 You will need your Social Security number.

 Have your birth certificate from the state where you were born.

 Bring your W-2 forms from your last year of employment.

 If you were in the military, bring your military discharge papers.

 If your spouse or children are applying for benefits, bring their birth certificates and Social Security numbers.

 If you were not born in the United States, bring proof of U.S. citizenship or lawful alien status.

 Provide the name of your bank and bank account numbers so your funds can be directly deposited into your account.


,  If any circumstances arise that affect your ability to collect your benefits, you must immediately notify the SSA.  These changes include a change of address, marital status or direct deposit accounts.  Also, if your citizenship status changes or you are leaving the United States for more than 30 days, you must notify the SSA.  Finally, the SSA must be made aware if you are convicted of a criminal offense, become unable to manage your funds or die."

 Enroll in Medicare when you turn 65.,
 Purchase Medigap insurance.,
 Save money to pay for healthcare in retirement.",How to Prepare for Retirement3,"  Medicare is health insurance from the U.S. government for people 65 and older.  Enroll by visiting the Social Security website at www.socialsecurity.gov or by calling 1-800-772-1213.  If you want your coverage to start the month you turn 65, enroll three months before your 65th birthday.  Medicare has several parts.Medicare Part A is hospital insurance that covers you inpatient care in a hospital.  It is free for most people 65 and older.

 Medicare Part B covers doctor’s visits, outpatient care and other services not covered by Medicare Part A.  You have to pay a premium for Medicare Part B.  It is based on your annual income.  As of 2012, the premiums ranged from $99.90 to 319.70.  The premium is deducted from your monthly Social Security check.

 Medicare Part C is the Medicare Advantage Plans.  This is insurance provided by a private company that contracts the Medicare to provide you Medicare Part A and Part B coverage.  It also usually provides prescription coverage.  You pay a monthly premium that varies depending on the plan you choose.

If you have a Medicare Advantage Plan, you don’t need a Medigap policy.



 Medicare Part D is prescription drug coverage.


,  Some people choose to purchase an additional health insurance policy to cover anything not covered by Medicare.  These expenses include co-pays and annual deductibles.  You can purchase Medigap insurance from a private health insurance company.You can choose from 12 different Medigap policies.  They are known as Medigap A through F.  Medigap A is the most basic, and each subsequent policy offers more coverage.

 If you are married, you and your spouse must each purchase a Medigap policy.  


,  When you reach 65, you will be eligible for Medicare, but this doesn’t cover everything.  You will have to pay a premium for some of your Medicare coverage, and you will also likely want to purchase Medigap insurance.  In addition, you will have to pay out of pocket for anything not covered by your insurance, such as co-pays and deductibles.  Fidelity Investments estimates that a retired couple will need to spend $240,000 of their own money to cover 20 years of healthcare expenses."

Compare pension and defined contribution plans.,
 Find out if your employer offers a pension plan.,
 Learn about your employer’s vesting schedule.,
 Access your pension benefits.,
 Decide how to collect your pension benefits.,
 Manage your lump-sum payment.,
 Pay taxes.",How to Prepare for Retirement4," Pensions are defined benefit plans, meaning that they provide you with a set amount each month in retirement. Other retirement plans, like 401(k)s, are defined contribution plans which only pay out money that has been put into the account over the years. These plans may also allows you to pick your own investments. The amount distributed to the plan holder depends on how much they want to withdraw. 

In other words, pension plans place the investment risk on the plan provider, whereas defined contribution plans place that risk on the plan holder.,  A pension plan is a retirement account provided by your employer.  It pays out a fixed amount when you retire.  The amount it pays is based on your salary and how long you worked for your employer.  A pension is a defined benefit plan.  This means that your employer automatically enrolls you in the plan.  You may need to remain employed for a certain amount of time, such as a year, before you qualify for enrollment.  Your employer makes all of the investment decisions, usually through an investment firm.,  Vesting means acquiring ownership of your benefits.You may need to work for a defined number of years before you become fully vested.Cliff vesting means that after a pre-determined number of years of continuous employment, you own 100 percent of your pension.  However, if you leave before you become vested, you forfeit any pension that has been saved for you.

 Graded vesting means that after a pre-determined number of years, you own a certain percentage of your pension.  The percentage you own increases incrementally the longer you remain employed by your employer.   After a certain number of years, you become 100 percent vested.  

 Keep your employer’s vesting schedule in mind if you are considering a career change.  Unlike other kinds of retirement accounts, you may not be able to take your pension with you if you leave your job.  The amount of the pension you own when you leave your job depends on your employer’s vesting schedule.


,  You cannot access your pension benefits until you reach retirement age.  The retirement age is defined by your pension plan.  Typically, you must be 65 years old.  Some pension plans allow you to begin collecting benefits when you are as young as 55 years of age or in the event of a disability.You may be able to start collecting your pension benefits before your retirement age.  However, you will not receive 100 percent of your pension if you choose this option.  Ask your employer to explain how your benefits vary depending upon the age at which you begin collecting.  


,  You can choose between a lump-sum payment or monthly annuity payments.  The option you choose depends on how much money you need per month.  Your comfort level with managing the responsibilities of a large sum of money also matters.If you aren’t an experienced investor, you may feel more comfortable with choosing to receive steady payments from your pension plan.  

 If you choose a lump-sum payment, you must understand how to budget it wisely and how to invest it so it continues to grow.

A lump-sum payment may be taxed unless it is rolled into an individual retirement account (IRA).,  If you choose to receive a lump-sum payment, you may be able to enjoy certain advantages.  With the help of a trusted financial advisor, you can plan to invest the money and leave it to your heirs.  However, you must also consider the responsibilities involved.With a lump-sum payment, you don’t have to worry about the financial health of your employer.  If your company goes out of business, you don’t have to worry that your pension benefits will go away.

 Invest your lump-sum payment to allow it to continue to grow.  You can put it into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), and put a portion of into an immediate annuity that pays you a monthly income.  This way you can enjoy a steady monthly income while allowing part of your pension to continue to grow.,  Your pension benefits may be subject to state and federal income taxes.  It depends on how your employer set up the plan contributions.  Generally, the taxable portion of your pension income is taxed at the same rate as your ordinary income.The IRS applies separate rules for “qualified” and “non-qualified” pension plans.  

 The “General Rule” applies to “non-qualified” plans.  A “non-qualified” pension plan does not get favorable tax treatment.  Contributions made by your employer or you do not get taxed.  But any return on the investment does get taxed in the year in which you receive it.

 The “Simplified Rule” applies favorable tax rates to “qualified” pension plans.  These are plans that accept pre-tax contributions.  With these plans, the benefit is fully taxable in the year in which you receive it.  However, chances are that your tax bracket will be lower when you retire than it was when you were working.  Therefore, you won’t pay as much in taxes on this income.

Start to plan early.",How to Prepare for Early Retirement2," Many retirement plans take time to mature and early investments will yield more benefits. Here are some options you can consider to save or invest money for retirement.


Pension plan: Ask potential employers if they offer a pension plan that will pay for certain benefits after you retire. Give preference to accepting jobs that offer a pension plan.
Employer's retirement plan: Explore retirement plans offered by your employer such as a 401(K) plan. Your employer will contribute a share of the money that you invest towards retirement, which will lower taxes for you and your employer. You will only be able to access the money after retirement but you will end up getting more than what you contributed.
Banking: Invest money in bank accounts with high interest rates. The more money you invest, the more you will earn as interest. If you can make long-term investments, you may want to open a Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) that can accrue interest over a long period of time and you are not required to pay taxes on any of the earned income as long as it is not withdrawn before retirement.
Real estate: If possible, buy a house that you can live in after retirement. Purchasing a home when property values are low will help you cut down your monthly living cost considerably after retirement.
Social Security: Pay taxes regularly before retirement. This will help you earn Social Security points and you can apply for Social Security benefits after you retire. On average, Social Security pays approximately 40 percent of what you earned before retiring as benefits to help you manage your cost of retirement. Applications can be filled and submitted online through the official website of the US Social Security Administration.

 Open a defined contribution plan with your employer.,
 Open a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA).,
Open a Roth IRA.,
 Open a Health Spending Account (HSA).",How to Prepare for Retirement5," Depending on the type of company for which you work, your employer may either offer a 401(k) or a 403(b) plan. You may be automatically enrolled in this type of plan and have employer matching (where your contributions are matched by your employer), depending on your employer's policies.These accounts are separate from individual retirement plans like IRAs or Roth IRAs, which do not involved your employer.

 Contributions are made pre-tax.  This means you only pay income taxes on the portion of your salary that you did not contribute to the retirement account.

 The funds you contribute to the account are then invested to allow them to grow.  Your employer may offer you a default investment.  Or, you may be able to choose how to invest the money.

 Your employer may also offer a matching program.  This means they may match your contributions up to a certain amount.

 You must comply with the limits for contributions.  The contribution limits depend on your age and marital status.

 As of 2015, for those under the age of 50, the maximum an individual can contribute is $18,000 per year or $1,500 per month.  Couples can contribute up to $36,000 per year.

 Those over the age of 50 can contribute up to $24,000 per year per individual, or up to $48,000 per year for a couple.

 You pay income taxes on the money when you collect it during retirement.  


, This is a bank account that allows you to save money for retirement in a tax-advantaged way. Also, age and the amount of contributions you are already making to retirement accounts at work affect the tax advantages of your IRA account.With a traditional IRA, you may be able to deduct contributions to your IRA on your tax return.  

A Rollover IRA is funded with money from a 401(k) or 403(b) from a previous employer.


, The tax advantages for which your IRA qualifies depends on the type of IRA account you open. With a Roth IRA, you make contributions to the retirement account post-tax. The money then grows tax-free over time. This means that when you withdraw the money during retirement, you don’t pay any taxes on it, but you cannot deduct contribution from income as made.
,  An HSA account allows you to save for certain kinds of expenses, such as doctor visits, prescription medications, dental and eye care and related costs.  Then, these expenses become tax deductible when you are preparing your annual tax return.  Unlike other kinds of retirement accounts, you can use the money before you retire.  The funds roll over from year to year, and you must only use them on healthcare-related expenses.  However, once you are 65, you can withdraw the funds and use the money for anything.The maximum annual contribution is $3,350 for an individual or $6,650 for a family.  The amount increases by $1,000 if a family member is 55 years of age or older.

 Choose the right time to move.,
 Consider your health.,
 Decide on a living arrangement.,
 Contemplate the consequences of moving to a remote locale.,
 Factor in your budget.",How to Prepare for Retirement6,"  Downsizing is a part of many people’s retirement plan.  However, leaving the family home may also require leaving behind a community and connections that are important to you.  Picking the right time to leave your family home is a personal decision.  For some, the change happens when both partners in a marriage are still alive and want to spend time together in a different place.  For others, the death of a spouse prompts the decision to move.  When you decide that the time has come to look for new housing in retirement, consider not only your budget, but also your lifestyle, the proximity to your family and the status of your health.,  If you are in good health, you can choose to live independently.  However, you must accept that changes in your health are an unavoidable part of aging.  Your health status can change gradually, or you may experience a sudden decline in health.  If you have enough money, you can stay in your home and arrange for professional caretakers to help you.  If not, you may have to arrange to either live with a family member or move to a facility where you will be cared for.,  Retirees have many different kinds of housing options.  Each has its own advantages and shortcomings.  Choose your living arrangement based on your needs, lifestyle and family circumstances.Staying in your family home is one option to consider.  If it’s not too big for you to manage, it might be the best place for you because you are already connected to the community.  To make this work, you may need to make plans to get help with home maintenance.  Also, down the road you may need to arrange for home health care.

If you stay in your home and have significant equity in that home, you may be able to get a reverse mortgage. This loan pays you for the equity in the home. It is only available to those over the age of 62.Moving to a townhouse or condominium community is an option if you don’t want to have to worry about property maintenance.  You can choose a mixed-age location or a 55-and-older community, depending on your preferences.

 Retirement communities are independent living quarters where you are provided with amenities such as chef-prepared dining, inside and outside property maintenance and a 24-hour nursing staff.


,  When you were younger, you may have dreamed of retiring in a tropical paradise.  However, actually doing this may isolate you from people you really need in retirement.  Think about the effect of detaching from your community connections and family ties on a permanent basis.  This is an even bigger consideration if you are single.  If you can afford it, consider purchasing a vacation home where you can live for part of the year.  This way, you can have the best of both worlds.
,  Where you end up in retirement will depend largely on your net worth and your monthly income.  Retirement communities, townhouses and vacation homes are expensive.  So are in-home personal care and skilled nursing services.  If you haven’t already done so, create a monthly budget.  Begin to plan for the long-term and think about how you are going to support yourself physically and financially as you age.  Enlist the help of you children and other family members in making these decisions."

 Anticipate the emotional impact of giving up your career.,
 Adjust to spending more time with your spouse or family.,
 Decide how you will structure your days.,
 Find other sources of social interaction.",How to Prepare for Retirement7,"  If you are someone who felt defined by your career, you may experience a significant sense of loss upon your retirement.  Also, the thought of somebody replacing you at work can make you feel unimportant.  It can be difficult to validate yourself without the connection to a career.  Over time, you may begin to feel depressed or anxious, and you may even begin to second-guess your decision to retire.Build a new identity for yourself by using your time to find meaningful ways to connect with other people and use your talents in a positive way.

 Some retirees find second “careers,” either paid or on a volunteer basis, that they find very gratifying.  


,  When you are both working full time, you and your spouse may have become accustomed to your independence from each other.  The changes to your daily routine in retirement may cause you to feel you’ve given up some of this autonomy.  Remember that with time you will learn to adjust to spending more time at home with your spouse.  However, it’s important to schedule some activities apart pursuing your separate interests.,  Think about how many hours per week you devote to your job.  Not just the 40-hour work week, but also commuting and spending time at home getting ready for work.  All of these hours will be free during your retirement.  Plan how you will spend that time being productive to avoid boredom.Do volunteer work.  Many people feel find fulfillment by devoting time to meaningfully giving back in some way.

 Spend more time being active.  Participate in outdoor activities that you enjoy such as golf.  Exercise frequently.  The physical activity will have an emotional and physical benefit.

 Plan to travel.  Plan to visit children and grandchildren who do not live nearby.  Schedule vacations to places you’ve always wanted to see.


,  Some people are homebodies and relish the idea of spending time on their own at home.  Others are social butterflies and thrive on being around other people.  Whichever you are, you will need to schedule activities that give you social interactions.  Joining clubs or groups, taking classes or getting a part-time job can provide you with the relationships you need to feel vital."

Extend your current employment.,
 Start a new career after retirement.,
 Stay within the income limits for Social Security.,
 Estimate the effect on your pension benefits.,
 Delay enrolling in Medicare Parts B and D.  If you are still covered under your employer’s health insurance policy, don’t pay the premiums to also enroll in Medicare Parts B and D.  That would be double-paying for health insurance.,
 Calculate the impact on your income tax.",How to Prepare for Retirement8," According to a study, nearly 40 percent of Americans age 55 and older are working. In fact, workers aged 55 and older accounted for virtually all of the workforce growth in the United States between 2007 and 2014.If you are physically still able to work, consider extending your current employment as long as you can, even if you qualify for retirement. Doing so will help you save even more for your eventual retirement. 
,  According to a study done by Merrill Lynch in 2014, nearly 40 percent of Americans age 55 and older are working.  In fact, workers aged 55 and older accounted for virtually all of the workforce growth in the United States between 2007 and 2014.  Nearly 60 percent of retirees venture into a new line of work after the age of 55.  Also, working retirees are three times more likely to be entrepreneurs than their younger counterparts.Delay tapping into your nest-egg.  Some people choose to continue working for financial reasons.  For example, many companies have eliminated pensions.  Also, recent economic uncertainty has eaten away at many people’s retirement savings.  

In addition, if your full retirement age for Social Security is 67, you may choose to continue working until you can collect your full benefits.Stay mentally active. Choosing to work in retirement isn’t all about the money.  It is a way for people to stay mentally active as they age. Others are motivated by increasing life expectancy, which means their retirement may last 20 years or more.  They are therefore motivated to find greater purpose, social connections and fulfillment.,  If you sign up for Social Security benefits before your full retirement age, you will likely have your benefits withheld while you are still collecting a salary.  As of 2009, if you earn more than $14,160, you must give $1 back to Social Security for every $2 you earn.  If you are of full retirement age, the limit is higher.  As of 2009, those at full retirement age could earn up to $37,680 and still collect Social Security benefits without a penalty.,  Most defined-benefit pension plans are calculated based on a pre-determined number of years.  If your tenure with the company exceeds that number of years, you won’t get any additional pension benefits.  Also, remember that your pension benefit is going to be based on your income for the last few years you worked.  If you work reduced hours in your later years, your lower earnings could reduce your pension benefit.,  Also, if you are enrolled in Medicare, your company’s health insurance plan is going to try to make Medicare your primary insurance.  This means you’ll be responsible for the co-pays and deductibles stated in your Medicare plan, which may be higher than those stated by your company’s healthcare plan.,  If you have already started to receive Social Security benefits or are collecting retirement income from a pension or an IRA, continuing to earn a paycheck on top of these income streams may bump you up into the next tax bracket.  This could cost you thousands of dollars in taxes.  If you are going to be receiving distributions from a 401(k), you can delay the payments until after you stop working.  But, if you have a traditional IRA, you must start receiving payments once you turn 70 ½, even if you are still working."

Discover what you’re good at.,
Set a financial goal.,
Make a commitment.",How to Retire Early by Building Passive Income1," Reflect on your strengths. Some people are good at investing, while others may be intimidated by the market or afraid of the risks. Other people are talented artists or writers. Still others possess a skill or knowledge for which people would be willing to pay. Think about how you can combine your interests and skills to make money.For example, a writer can sell books, a musician can sell songs and a finance buff may be able to clean up in the market.
Don’t be afraid to try a combination of things. You don’t have to stick to one area of expertise. For example, you might earn some income selling e-books, and then turn around and invest some of those earnings.;
, Determine the income level at which you want to live. Think about where you want to live, what living expenses you will have and how much it will cost to live a lifestyle that will make you happy. This will tell you how much money you need to be earning per year in passive income. Depending on that nature of your passive income revenue stream, you may need to work a certain number of hours per week.For example, you may decide that you need to earn $200,000 per year in residual income to be able to retire and live the way you want. If you are writing and investing to earn that income, you may need to work a few hours each day to maintain your revenue stream.

, Building reliable streams of residual income requires discipline and commitment. You need to control spending and save as much money as possible to have a nest egg to get you started. Also, you have to promise yourself that you will not spend from your savings. Investing as much of your savings as possible and making it harder to liquidate will help you with this. Finally, you must devote time every day, more in the beginning than in later years, to keeping your income stream viable."

Purchase dividend stocks.,
Participate in peer to peer (P2P) lending.,
Purchase fixed income securities.,
Invest in an annuity.",How to Retire Early by Building Passive Income2," Dividend stocks are shares that you own in a company. The company pays you your share of the profit in dividends. Some companies pay a fixed amount per accounting period, and many pay either quarterly or annually. Once you are paid your dividends, you can either cash them out or choose to reinvest them, allowing you to own more shares and therefore earn more dividends.A common way to choose dividend stocks is to invest in them through mutual funds or exchange traded funds (ETF’s).
You want to research the companies in which you invest. Purchase dividend stocks that have a history of paying high yields. But also consider market trends and think about investing in companies that may pay high yields in the future., Peer to peer lending means lending money to borrowers who don’t typically qualify for traditional loans. Popular P2P lending platforms include Prosper and Lending Club. These platforms act as a middleman between you and the borrower. They vet the borrower to make sure that they are borrowing money for legitimate reasons. Then, you can choose the borrowers to whom you want to lend. You can hedge your risks by lending small loans to many different borrowers with different credit backgrounds.With Prosper, the interest rate you can earn ranges from 5.48 percent for low-risk loans to 10.78 percent for high risk loans., Consider buying into certificate of deposit (CD) ladders and/or a variety of corporate or government bonds. This would involve buying into a bonds or CDs that mature at different years in the future, maybe some in 5 or 10 years and others in 20 or 30. This strategy protects your principal because the risk from fluctuations in the interest rate is spread out over time.


A CD ladder is an investment strategy in which you divide the amount you want to invest into equal amounts and you purchase several CD’s with different maturity dates. It provides you with a steady income as the CD’s mature at different times.The maturity date is the date on which the interest payments stop and the principal plus interest is paid back to you.For example, you can have CD’s that mature in 6 months, one year, two years, etc.
For more on bonds, see how to invest in bonds.

, The goal of an annuity is to give yourself a reliable stream of income during your retirement. To set up an annuity, you can purchase them from an insurance company. You can make a lump sum payment or a series of payments. Then the insurance company repays you in regular disbursements that can begin immediately or at some point in the future.Your gains on your contributions (the growth portion of your investment) is tax-deferred, meaning you don’t pay income tax on it until you receive disbursements during retirement.
Your contributions may be pre-tax as well if your annuity is an IRA or 401(k). However, you will pay a penalty for withdrawing from this type of annuity before the age of 59.5.
You can receive disbursements for a fixed amount of time, or you can choose to receive them until your death.
Fixed annuities earn a modest amount of interest. The amount of your disbursement is a guaranteed fixed amount based on the balance in your annuity.
Variable annuities are higher-risk. Your contributions are invested in a mix of mutual funds, and your disbursements are based on the performance of your investment.
Indexed annuities are a hybrid of fixed and variable annuities. You receive a guaranteed minimum payment. But a portion of your disbursement is linked to the performance of the market.

Browse through the Kindle Bestseller’s list to identify what people are buying. Read reviews and look for gaps in the market. You can write the book yourself, or you can hire a ghostwriter to write the book for you. Invest in a graphic artist to create a compelling cover for your book.You can hire a ghostwriter from sites like Upwork and pay between $.02 and $.04 per word.
Use an app like Scrivener to format your document for Kindle and other platforms.

Popular e-book publishing platforms include Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), Smashwords, BookBaby, Barnes and Noble’s PubIt, Lulu, Booktango, iBooks Author, and Scribd., You can make money from your digital photos by selling them on microstock websites. These websites charge customers for using the images, and then they pass a portion of the payment back to you. The typical payment for an image starts at $1 for small images and increases for larger images. Popular sites are iStockphoto.com and Shutterstock.com.In the beginning, you make approximately 15 percent of the sale, but the percentage you earn may increase over time and as you sell more images. Plan to build a diverse portfolio of images.
The key to being successful is to sell a large quantity of images. You make a small amount per image. But the more images you sell, those tiny amounts start to add up.
Invest in a digital SLR camera for sharp images.
Remember not to include any recognizable brands in your photos. Also, if you are using people, you must have a signed release to use their image.

, Udemy is a platform that allows you to create an online course that you can sell. Course prices typically range from $47 to $197. The length of the course can be as short as 30 minutes or run from two to three hours. The average instructor earns as much as $7,000 from a course. However, the amount you can earn varies, and it depends largely on how you market the course. Those with a large social media following can market to a large audience and can therefore generate more income., If you can compose your own music, then you can license it and sell it. The first step is copyrighting the music. This is called a song copyright, which protects the composition. If the music has been recorded, then you also need a master copyright, which protects the recording. Register your copyrights with the Library of Congress, which costs $35. Once you have copyrights to protect you from unauthorized use of your music, you can pursue different avenues for generating money from your music.A television show may use your music for an episode. This is called a television synch license. The music supervisor of the television show would need to pay for the use of the song copyright and the master copyright. A separate fee would be negotiated for each.A recording artist may purchase your music to record and perform it. This is called a mechanical license, and it give the artist permission to record and release your song. You would earn royalties on albums or singles sold.Sell your music to a Production Music Library. These are collections of instrumental music that are used as background music on television, in film, on the radio, in documentaries or as music that is played when someone is waiting on hold on the phone.You can earn micro-sync fees when someone uses your music to sync to a YouTube video, a video game, television, commercials or film.

Purchase shares in a real estate investment trust (REIT).,
Become a landlord.,
Lend private money to other investors.,
Invest in loans or notes.",How to Retire Early by Building Passive Income4," An REIT is a company that owns and operates commercial real estate such as apartment buildings, malls, office buildings, hotels and warehouses. Investing in an REIT allows you to earn a share of the income produced by these commercial buildings. You can purchase shares in an REIT from a stock broker. To avoid fraud, stick with shares that are publicly-traded, listed on a major stock exchange and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)., Purchase rental properties that generate revenue for you every month. You can manage the properties yourself, or you can use a real estate team to fill vacancies and hire a property manager to take care of the property. You can purchase fixer-uppers, hire a contractor to repair them and then find tenants. Alternatively, you can purchase turn-key properties that are already repaired and already rented., You can lend money to other investors who need capital to purchase or repair property. Secure the loan with a Deed of Trust. This means that legal title of the property is transferred to trustee, or neutral third party, who holds the property in as security for the loan.You can earn as much as 15 percent interest on these loans., Mortgage companies sell mortgage notes to investors, usually as mortgage-backed securities. They can be performing or non-performing notes. Performing notes are those on which the borrowers are making payments. If the borrower is behind on payments it becomes a non-performing note. If you buy non-performing notes, you can usually purchase the loan for a fraction of its original value. Then, you have the option of offering a loan modification, allowing a short sale, which means selling the property for less than debts still owed on it, or foreclosing on the loan. Whichever option you choose, you stand to make money because of the discount you got when you purchased the note."

Start early.,
Save more.,
Invest outside of your retirement plans.,
Keep a few additional key factors in mind.,
Buy a smaller house.,
Live in a low-tax state.,
Cut out excess expenses.,
Barter or trade when possible.,
Consider taking a job with an early pension.,
Avoid having kids before you start investing for your retirement.,
Try not to dip into your retirement fund before the time comes.,

Pay off your debts.",How to Retire at 50," Getting an early start on your savings will increase the likelihood of being able to save enough to retire on by the age of 50. The ideal time to begin is as soon as you enter the workforce in your early 20s.


Simply put, if you get a late start on building your retirement savings, you will need to set aside more of your annual income than you would have to do if you started at the age of 25.;
, The average savings rate in the U.S. is 3.7 percent, but if you want to retire by the age of 50, you might need to save as much as 75 percent, instead.In order to save more, you will need to live below your means. In addition to the fact that you can save more money, another advantage of living below your means is that doing so prepares you to live on a lower amount during your retirement. Instead of needing 80 percent of your current income to live during retirement, you will be able to survive on 50 percent, since you can already do so now.
By the time you reach the age of 50, you will need about 33 times as much money as you expect to spend during your first year of retirement, after subtracting Social Security benefits.
The amount of money you need to save to reach a sufficient savings level by age 50 will vary depending on how much yield or interest you are receiving from your accounts or bonds. The amount of savings needed by yield percentage is estimated as follows:You'll need $714,286 in savings with a yield of 7 percent.
You'll need $833,333 in savings with a yield of 6 percent.
You'll need $1,000,000 in savings with a yield of 5 percent.
You'll need $1,250,000 in savings with a yield of 4 percent.
You'll need $1,666,667 in savings with a yield of 3 percent.
You'll need $2,500,000 in savings with a yield of 2 percent.



, If your official retirement plans have withdrawal penalties when you try to access your money earlier than agreed upon, you can avoid facing these penalties by investing in other areas and using that money during the early stages of your retirement instead of money from your official retirement plans.


You might be tempted to play it safe by sticking to tax-protected retirement accounts, but these will usually not be enough.
Look into investment opportunities like dividend stocks, rental properties, bonds, and peer-to-peer lending.Also look for investments in tax-deferred or tax-free assets over assets that can be taxed.
Make sure that your portfolio is large and diversified across asset classes. This is your best way to ensure that your portfolio can withstand losses and survive a bad market.
Invest more conservatively as you get older. The riskier your portfolio is during the later stages of life, the more you will lose if the market takes a sudden turn for the worse.

, There are a few considerations outside of savings and investing that you will need to bear in mind when calculating how much money you need for retirement.Think about your life expectancy. Plan for a long life. There is a 45 percent chance that one person in a relationship will reach the age of 90, and a 20 percent chance that one will reach the age of 95. Make sure that you have plenty of money to last a long time.
Also think about medical costs. As you get older, your medical needs will increase, and so will your medical bills.
Pay attention to inflation. You can expect inflation to cut your spending power in half over the course of 30 years.

, Instead of buying the biggest, nicest house your money can get you, opt for a moderately sized house that only provides you with the basics you need.


On a similar note, live in an inexpensive neighborhood. You do not need to live in the slums somewhere, but you should opt for a middle class neighborhood instead of a high class one, and move to a region that is statistically cheaper to live in.
Another way to cut housing costs is to switch to a shorter mortgage. If you can pay off your house in 15 years rather than 30 years, you can save a significant amount of money that you would otherwise lose to interest.If you can rent out a portion of your home, seriously consider doing so. This income can help you pay off your mortgage, allowing you to save more of your own money for your retirement.

, Some states have lower rates on income tax, property tax, and sales tax. Living in one of these states will allow you to save up more of your money and make it easier to live on less during your retirement.


A few options to consider include Nevada, Texas, and Florida.

, Review your monthly expenses and determine if there are any you can cut out. These might include a land line, movie channels, and expensive data packages for your cell phone.


Look for free ways to enjoy your hobbies. In many cases, you might be able to find volunteer opportunities that allow you to do the things you love at no cost. For instance, if you love horses, volunteer at an equestrian center instead of buying your own horse.
Sell your car. Even an economy car can cost you twice as much as the initial price you paid for it when you take into account depreciation, fees, insurance, and maintenance. Rent a car when necessary. For everyday needs, take public transportation.

, If you have special skills that can be of use to others, barter with people who have different skill sets instead of paying for services with money.


For example, if you have IT skills, you can offer to build a website or network for someone who can repair a broken sink or damaged door for you in exchange.
Trading can also extend to your vacations, if you opt for the luxury of taking one at all. House swap when going on vacation instead of paying money for a hotel. Connect with people who live elsewhere and set up house swaps every summer or so. This will provide you with free lodging when you go on vacation.

, Even though pensions are fairly rare nowadays, some high-risk jobs do offer early pensions. The obvious disadvantage here is that you may need to risk your life on the job.


To take advantage of this option, you should consider a job as a police officer, firefighter, or military personnel.

, Children do not make it impossible to retire early, but they do cost money. If you have kids before you start saving and investing in your future retirement, you will be less likely to put aside enough money yearly to retire by 50.


Families that bring in $59,300 yearly will spend about $11,000 on each child under the age of 18 every year. Families who make more spend even more.By investing before you have kids, you start from a different state of mind, which makes it easier to keep your investments and savings as part of your budget.

, If you find yourself facing tighter financial conditions, you might feel tempted to take money from your retirement savings to help yourself out.


It would be wiser to look for ways to cut costs and earn more income, however, to avoid draining your retirement funds.
If you withdraw money early, you might lose the benefits of compounding interest and may even need to pay a penalty for your early withdrawal.

, If you cannot pay an item off at the end of the month, re-consider charging it to your credit card.


If you have to pay your credit cards off slowly, you will lose a lot of your money to credit card interest. That means you will have less money to save up for your retirement.

, You should not have to live like a pauper while saving for your retirement. If you make saving too difficult, you are more likely to fall off the bandwagon and break your budget apart.


Your current budget should include things that you enjoy. The key is to look for cheaper ways to do the things you love, not to stop doing those things completely.

, Determine this budget based on the amount of money you have saved up. Try living off this budget for six months. If you can do so without much difficulty, you might be able to manage to retire based on your current savings.This is, in effect, a trial run. If you cannot live on this budget without depleting your savings or relying on your credit cards, you are not ready to retire yet.
You need to understand what your cash flow will be like after retirement when crafting this budget. Figure out how much money you need every month, quarter, and year, while also determining how much money you can afford to spend from your savings each month based on how high that savings is at the current moment.
Factor inflation into your budget. It could easily go up to 5 percent.

, Medicare will not start until you reach age 65. Since you will no longer have health insurance provided by your employer after you retire, you need to have your own affordable and reliable plan.


Keep in mind that health insurance costs rise faster than inflation, especially considering recent changes in health insurance nationwide. Cheap plans will be harder to come by than they might have been a decade ago.
If at all possible, look for a policy with low deductibles and co-pays that cover prescriptions, doctor visits, hospitalization, dental costs, and vision care.

, Kids are expensive. If you have children who still rely on you financially by the age of 50, your savings may not go as far as you need it to.


The same applies if you have parents or other relatives who rely on you in any financial capacity.

, If you still owe money to lenders or creditors by the time you reach the age of 50, you could end up blowing a significant part of your retirement budget paying these debts off.


Your home and car, if you have one, should be paid off.
If you have additional debt, like college loan debt, you might not be ready to retire at 50.

Open petals for a fuller, more realistic look.",How to Make Ric Rac Flowers1," Start with 10 to 12 inches (25.5 to 30.5 centimeters) for a small rose.Use 16 to 17 inches (40.5 to 43 centimeters) for a larger one.Keep in mind that you can always trim off the excess ric rac.

The wider the ric rac, the bigger the rose will be. If you want a small rose, use thin ric rac. If you want a larger rose, use wider ric rac.Your rose can be any color you want. Pink, red, and white are great choices, but why not try baby blue, light purple, or even rainbow?;
, Overlap the ends and secure them with a drop of hot glue. The inner, scooped parts of the curves should be facing each other. The outer, bumpy part of the curves should be facing out., Pull the upper strip under the bottom one. Keep it straight and don't let it twist. The strips should naturally lock together at the curve. Continue ""braiding"" the strip to the other end, then secure it with another drop of hot glue., This is not completely necessary, but it will help hold the ric rac together during the next step. Do not sew right down the middle of the ric rac strip. Instead, sew it to the left or two the right of the strip. Make sure that you are catching both strips as you sew, however.

Use a thread color that matches your ric rac.

, Pinch one end of the ric rac strip, then start rolling it tightly towards the other end. Add a drop of hot glue every inch (2.5 centimeters) or so.This will help hold your rose together and prevent it from popping out when you go to finish it.

Don't use too much glue. Less is more.

, When it's the size you want, add a final drop of hot glue on the ric rac, and press it down. Make sure that you have about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of ric rac left for tucking under the rose., Trim off any excess ric rac with a pair of fabric scissors. If you sewed down the ric rac strip earlier, make sure the stitched part facing towards the bottom. This is important. If it is on the top, you won't be able to open the rose., This is not completely necessary, but it will give your rose a nicer finish. Trace the bottom of the rose onto a scrap of matching felt. Cut the circle out, then hot glue it to the bottom of the rose.Consider gluing some silk or fabric leaves to the bottom of the flower. This will make it look even more rose like. Do this before you add the felt circle., You can leave your rose closed up, or you can gently pull the petals down. This will give it a fuller, more realistic look. Start from outside and work your way in. Consider leaving the center petals closed."

Continue laying down more rows of ric rac.,
Trim off the excess ric rac and stitch it down.,
Hot glue an embellishment to the center.,
Hot glue the other felt circle to the back of the flower.",How to Make Ric Rac Flowers2," Use the circle to trace a second one, and cut it out as well. Plan on making the circles about 2 inches (5 centimeters) across. They do not have to be perfect, but they need to match up.The color of the felt does not matter, but it would be best if it matches your ric rac. This way, if you get any gaps, they won't be as obvious.

, Make sure that the outer loops stick out over the edge of the circle, and the inner loops are inside the circle.Set the other circle aside for now., Use a needle and thread to secure the bottom loops to the felt circle.If you don't know how to sew, or if you don't have any needles or thread on hand, you can use tiny drops of hot glue instead.

If you want to make a dahlia-type flower, gather the ric rac as you sew it., Let the outer loops overlap the inner loops of the first row. Again, stitch the bottom loops in place. Don't stitch the outer loops. This will allow them to flare out and look like petals., Make sure that each row overlaps the previous one slightly. As you get towards the center, the ric rac may start to buckle, which is fine. Many flowers get fuller and bushier towards the center!, When you get to the center, cut off the excess ric rac with a pair of fabric scissors. Stitch it down using 2 to 3 stitches, then tie the knot on the back., You can use a button for a rustic look, or a pretty rhinestone for something fancier. Make sure that it is big enough to cover any visible felt.

If you are using a button, consider sewing on instead. This will give you a nice, rustic-chic look., This will cover up the stitching and give your flower extra support. If you wish to use these flowers as hair clips, cut a slit in the second felt circle. Open and slide a hair clip through it. Hot glue the circle and the top of the clip to the back of the flower."

While not every person knows the language of flowers, there will usually be someone around to ""translate"" for them, so don't worry, the message will usually get to them, and if not, it's always the thought that counts!;
, One major consideration to bear in mind is the season; even if you really, really want to say something in flowers, if it isn't the right season for those flowers you could end up expressing yourself in a very expensive way, with air-freighted blooms from abroad. To avoid this difficulty, have some back-up meanings in case your flowers aren't in season or aren't available.

Learn about fabric types.,
Understand colors.,
Know your approximate size and measurements beforehand.,
Have an idea what looks good on you and what does not.,

, Hopefully, by now, you will know what “fuchsia” or “magenta” is. Most online stores will have color swatches posted online. However, please be aware those colors are not color true (looking at a color in natural light and close-up), as you are looking into a computer screen. See whether the internet store will send you color swatches in the mail or at least, send you another picture with a close indication of the color you are looking for.

, Do not use your regular size to order your dress as every manufacturer cuts their dresses according to their 'own' size charts. Measure yourself first with a tape measure, your bust, waist, and hips, over your undergarments. Compare these numbers to the manufacturer’s size chart provided to find your best size. If you are between sizes, select the next size up as the rule is “easier to take in than to let out”.

, By recalling previous buying experiences, you can make a sound decision based on what worked and what didn't. If you have large hips, an A-line skirt is flattering. If you have flabby arms, a long sleeve jacket is the way to go. A longer blouse or jacket hides a problem stomach area. Also, try to figure out which colors look good with your skin tone that match what the rest of the bridal party will be wearing. If you're going on a shopping trip, take a friend for some helpful and constructive advice.

, Their prices are on the most part, reasonable. Don't forget to check out matching accessories such as purse and hat. Check on the return policy as every store sets their own. Remember that you are shopping for a “special occasion” outfit and the return policy is usually more strict than for regular everyday clothing.

, Online shopping could definitely be the best option for you from now on and not only for your mother of the bride dress!

Pear body: ball gown, A-line silhouettes
Rectangle body: mermaid, empire waist
Hourglass body: natural waistline, added waistline accents;
, Flattering your body is the most important part of choosing the right shape for you. Other aspects go into your decision. They can help lead you toward the right fabric for your dress as well.


Location of the wedding is important. If you’re on the beach, you want a soft, light, and flowy shape and fabric. If you’re having a wedding in a grand cathedral, consider the season along with how much you want to stand out on your day in order to choose the shape and fabric.
Determine your skill set. Some shapes and fabrics are more difficult to sew. If you’re new to sewing, choose a more basic shape and a fabric that allows for mistakes.

, Find a material that you love and that you can work with. You may like the feel of a fabric but not the way it flows. The only way to be sure of this is to try dresses on in multiple fabrics, just like you did in multiple shapes. Of course, you can choose any fabric that you’d like, but there are popular fabrics for wedding dresses.Chiffon: Delicate, sheer, and often layered
Jersey: Elastic knit fabric, lengthwise and crosswise ribbing
Moire: Heavy, silk taffeta, wavy design
Organza: Crisp, sheer, stiffer texture
Satin: Heavy, smooth, and high sheen
Silk: Expensive, comes in multiple textures
Taffeta: Crisp, smooth, slight ribbing
Tulle: Netting made of silk, nylon, or rayon; used mostly for skirts and veils.

, Although standard wedding dresses are often labeled as “white,” there are multiple shades of white commonly used. Ivory, crème, off-white, pure white, stark white, and silk white are just a few. Find one that compliments your complexion.

, Now that you have a good idea of the shape you want and the fabric you’re going to use, draw out what you want your dress to look like. Sketch front and back, and sketch any details in a closer portion if needed., Have someone else take your measurements. It is more accurate for someone else to do it rather than yourself. After sketching the shape that you want, be sure to label it with your measurements.

, Measure at the fullest part of your chest. Be sure to wear the bra that you’ll wear on your wedding day when taking measurements. You should be wearing nothing on top of the bra., Stand naturally with your heels together in a relaxed position. Measure the fullest part of your hip, being sure to go full circle., This measurement should be at the natural curve of your waist. The smallest waist area is approximately 1” above your belly button.

, Once you have your fabric and style picked out, you can go to fabric stores and look through pattern books or you can order online. Each will be rated by level of difficulty.Make sure that a key/glossary, layout, and step-by-step instructions are included.
When you order your pattern, it is easy to combine multiple sizes to get the pattern as close to your measurements as possible.

, Patterns can be printed on a variety of materials. For example, it can be printed on large pieces of tissue paper, or stiffer white paper. The stiffer paper is better if you’ll be using it a lot. If you decide on tissue paper, make an extra pattern, just in case something happens to the original.

, Now that you have your patterns, you’ll have the exact measurements that you’ll need to construct your dress. Go to the fabric store and pick up your fabric.


If you’re going to use lace, you’ll want a base fabric. You’ll attach the lace overlay over this base layer.
Some fabrics will be on special order. As soon as you decide on your fabric, make sure to ask if you need to special order it or if it will be available the day of.

, Lay the pieces of your pattern onto your fabric and pin it down with straight pins. Follow along the side of the pattern to cut out your fabric pieces into the right size and shape for your dress. Do this with the inside of your fabric facing up.


If you plan on adding pleats to your dress, make sure to cut extra fabric.

, Once all of your fabric pieces have been cut, pin them together (inside out). Keep your pins along the 1.5” of seam allowance from your pattern. Use a sewing model form to help you visualize the fit of the dress as you put it together., Fabric is flat. Once your fabric is pinned together, fold, bend, and gather it to accommodate for the curves of your body. If you plan on pleating the skirt, pin it to hold the pleats and sew over the pins. You can pull the pins out later., Sew the seams by following the shape that you cut out according to your pattern.


Use vertical princess seams. These seams go from the top to the bottom. It is impossible to make a one piece dress without vertical princess seams. The fabric cut should reflect that, if not, you may want to pick another pattern to follow.

, Even if you have extra fabric on the bottom or sides of your dress, follow the pattern strictly. It was designed in your size and your dress can be taken in much more easily than taken out once it’s been sewn.

, Once again, you’ll want help. Once you’ve sewed all of your seams, gathers, and darts, try your dress on. Make any adjustments you need to in order to get the proper fit. Have your friend pin these adjustments for you.

, Take the dress off and sew over the pins to make the necessary adjustments to your dress. Now is also the time to add embellishments. If you have a jeweled belt, lace applique, or any other embellishments, add them to your dress as the finishing touch., Cut any loose strings, make one more round of adjustments, or sew something blue into the inside of your dress if you need to. After this, it’s ready for your big day.


Follow care instructions provided with the fabric.

Choose a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight.It normally takes around two weeks for flowers to air dry. If your region is more humid, it may take slightly longer.;
, Using silica gel is a slightly more demanding process when it comes to preserving flowers. However, silica gel can help you better maintain a bouquet's size and colors. Silica gel is a sand-like substance you can purchase at a local craft store.


Find a large, sealable container. Fill it with at least one inch of silica gel. At your flowers and cover them in the gel completely. Then, close the container.Usually, the flowers should dry in 2 to 6 days. When you finish the drying process, remove the flowers and gently dust off any extra silica gel. The flowers may lose some color during this process., Freeze drying is method in which a bouquet is sprayed with starch, which helps preserve color, and then baked in a freeze dryer.This is by far the most expensive option as you'll have to pay to have it done professionally.

Choose the right flowers.,
Press using books.,
Make a wooden flower press.,
Use a microwave.,
Handle pressed flowers with care.",How to Preserve Wedding Flowers2," You can also press flowers in order to preserve them, using books or a flower press. Regardless of which flower pressing method you choose, you need to discard flowers that won't press well. Go for flowers that are not yet fully mature. You should avoid flowers that are particularly thick, like roses. Trim off any unnecessary leaves or petals you do not want preserved prior to pressing., One of the easiest ways to press flowers is using books You likely have some heavy books lying around the house. These can be used to press flowers.


To start, place your flower or flowers between two pieces of paper. Then, close the paper and flowers between the pages of a book. When pressing multiple flowers, make sure to space them out so they're not touching. Choose a book big enough to close completely over the flowers.Place more books on top of the book you're using. This will help weigh down the flowers. From here, change the paper sheets you're using every few days and then repress the flowers between the book. In two to three weeks, the flowers should be completely dry., If you're handy, a wooden flower press might be a good option for you. Once made, it requires slightly less maintenance than using books.


Use two rectangular pieces of plywood. Choose a size big enough to cover all the flowers you're pressing. Drill holes into all four corners. Make sure the holes line up with one another.Place your flower or flowers between two pieces of paper. Place the paper and flowers between the plywood rectangles.
Tighten the boards together using long bolts and wingnut bolts. Set aside for a couple of weeks. Your flowers should dry out., You can speed up the book drying process by using a microwave first. Put your flower or flowers between two sheets of paper. Then, press the sheets of paper between two books. Then, microwave the books for one minute. Allow the books to cool off and repeat as needed until the flowers are almost dry. Allow them to air dry the rest of the way. Cooking flowers until they're fully dry can cause damage.If you're worried about damaging your books by microwaving them, you can buy a microwavable flower press online or at a local craft store., When they are completely dry, pressed flowers will be extremely delicate and should be placed in an album ,frame, or book for safekeeping. You can remove flowers from between paper using your fingers. However, it may be safer to use tweezers as this minimizes the risk of damaging your flowers.

Store your flowers properly after preserving them.",How to Preserve Wedding Flowers3," If you want to preserve wedding flowers, choose flowers that are easy to press or dry when planning your wedding. This will make the preservation process easier down the road. Roses tend to be one of the easiest types of flowers to preserve. Flowers with fleshier stems are also a good choice, such as peonies, hydrangea, and ranunculus., If you want to preserve your wedding bouquet, have a separate tossing bouquet. Flowers can easily become damaged when tossed, which can make them harder to preserve. Have a separate throwaway bouquet for the wedding and keep the actual bouquet in a vase safely away from the ceremony., After you preserve your flowers, consider how you want to store them. A frame or a shadow box can help keep pressed or dried flowers from becoming damaged. It can also help prevent decay and is a good option if you want to display your flowers. You may also want to look into purchasing a bouquet box, a special device designed to keep preserved flowers safe from harm."

Get some thin, wooden dowels.,
Choose and cut your ribbon.,
Tie the ribbons around the tip of the dowel.,
Thread some gold or silver twine through your bell.,
Tie the twine around the dowel.,
Tie the ribbons once more.",How to Make Wedding Bell Wands1," You can buy long ones and cut them down yourself, or you can buy shorter ones that are already the right height; they usually come in a pack. Look for something around 12 to 14 inches (30.48 to 35.56 centimeters) long and ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide. This will be the base of your wand.


You can leave the dowels blank, or you can spray paint them. Choose a neutral color, such as white, silver, or gold.Alternatively, you can stain the dowels instead. Use a natural stain, such as vinegar and coffee.;
, Choose two different colors of ribbon, preferably something that matches your wedding colors. Cut the ribbons so that they are twice as long as you want them to be. Something around 36 to 40 inches (91.44 to 101.6 centimeters) long would be ideal. You will need one piece of each color for each wand.


The ribbons can be the same or different. Experiment with satin and sheer, thick and thin combinations.

, Stack the ribbons together, find the center, then tie them around the dowel, about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) down from the tip. Make sure that there are equal lengths of ribbon to either side of the knot.Treat both ribbons as a single ribbon.
Consider adding a drop of glue to the dowel before wrapping the ribbons around it. This will help secure the ribbons and keep them from sliding down the dowel.

, Cut a short piece of gold or silver twine, about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) long. Feed one end through the top loop of your bell.You can use jingle bells or standard, trumpet-shaped bells.


If you are using jingle bells, choose something small, about ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) in diameter.If you are using standard bells, choose something tall, about 1½ inches (3.81 centimeters).
The twine will be visible and lend the wand a decorative touch. If you don't want the twine to be visible consider using clear thread or fishing line instead.
Alternatively, you can use a very thin ribbon that matches your wedding colors.

, Place the twine right behind the dowel. Make sure that it is resting right over the ribbon. Wrap both ends over to the front of the dowel, and tie them into a secure, double-knot, right over the ribbons' knot., Instead of doing a typical double-knot, try a square knot instead. You simply reverse the order in which you crossed the ribbon strands. For example, if you crossed right-over-left the first time around, you will want to cross left-over-right this time around."

Tie the ribbons to the eye screw.,
Cut some shorter pieces of ribbon.,
Tie the short ribbon to a 1½-inch (3.81-centimeter) tall bell.,
Tie the ribbon to the eye screw in a bow.",How to Make Wedding Bell Wands2," Look for something that is around 12 to 14 inches (30.48 to 35.56 centimeters) long and ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide. If you can't find any dowels the right length, you can buy longer ones and cut them down yourself.Consider spray painting the dowels a neutral color, such as white, silver, or gold.
Consider staining the dowels using a natural stain, such as vinegar and coffee., This will make twisting the eye screws in easier. A thumb tack will be the easiest way to make the hole.If you have a drill with a tiny drill bit, you could try that instead.

, The thinner the eye screws are, the easier this will be. At one point, you may need to use pliers to help twist the screws in the rest of the way. Be very careful at this point; thicker eye screws may cause the dowels to split., You will need around 4 to 5 pieces of ribbon for each wand. The ribbons can be all different, but they should match your wedding colors. Aim to make them around 24 inches (cc centimeters) long. This will give you a nice, full wand.Play around with different widths and textures, including satin and sheer.

, Starting with the widest ribbon, feed one end through the eye screw, and tie it in a secure, double-knot. Continue tying ribbons to the eye screw until you have 4 or 5. As you continue to add ribbons, the eye screw will start to fill up. Be sure to leave enough space for one last ribbon so that you can tie the bell on.

, You will need one of these for each wand that you are making so that you can attach the bells. Aim to make these around 12 inches (cc centimeters) long.

, Thread the ribbon through the bell first, make sure that it's centered, then tie it in a double-knot.The standard, trumpet-shaped bells work better for this style of wand than the ball-shaped jingle bells. You can use silver or gold bells--whichever one fits your color scheme better.

, Thread the ribbon through the eye screw. Tie it into a secure knot, then tie it into a bow.Trim down the tails if they are too long.


If you want to, you can do a double bow instead."

Choose a suitable basket.,
Choose ribbon for the basket.,
Choose flowers to go outside the basket.,
Plan the design.,
Attach the ribbon.,
Attach the flowers.,
Add fresh or dried petals.",How to Decorate a Flower Girl's Basket," Look in any craft store like JoAnn Fabrics or Michaels for suitable baskets. Ideally, you want a basket that is dainty and small with a sturdy handle. It should be large enough to contain the desired amount of flower petals, but small enough for a child to carry in one hand.


You should also make sure that it is a color that fits the wedding theme; if not, make sure that it is a neutral color or white. For example, if you are getting married on a beach, and your colors are yellow and lilac, you could try going with a white, wooden basket with distressed paint. Then attach yellow hydrangeas or roses and lavender to the basket.
Typical flower girl baskets are made from wood, however, you can choose any material like steel or wire. You can even go the non-traditional route and use a metal pail or felt for your flower girl basket.Depending on the season and location, you can even cover your basket in other materials like moss, sequins, beads, or river stones. For example, if you are getting married outside in a wooded area, a basket covered in moss and flowers is a perfect addition to the surrounding scenery.;
, You can use any type of ribbon - like satin, silk, or velvet - to tie onto the basket. You can also use a combination of wide and narrow ribbons that coordinate with the wedding colors. For example, if your colors are blush and gold, the ribbons on your basket should be the same.


About 4 to 5 yards (3.7 to 4.6 m) of narrow ribbon and 2 to 3 yards (1.8 to 2.7 m) of wide ribbon will be enough for one small basket.
For an added touch, try adding the bride and groom's initials or a message like ""Here Comes the Bride,"" to thick, streaming ribbons attached to the basket's front., You will likely have gone through flower arrangements and chosen your bouquets before putting together the flower girl basket, which will make this process much simpler. For example, if your bridal bouquets consist mainly or roses or lilies, try ordering a few extra of these flowers to break apart and attach to the basket. If you don’t want to use fresh flowers, you can also choose artificial ones like silk.One of the benefits of decorating with artificial flowers is that the basket will remain as beautiful as it was on the day of the wedding. This makes a wonderful keepsake for the flower girl.

, There are several options when considering how to decorate your basket. For example, you can add silk, satin, or velvet ribbon by threading it around the handle. Or you can create a rosette or bow for each side of the basket where the handle meets the basket bowl.


You can also add ribbon roses around the edge of the basket. These can be purchased ready-made. Then you can glue them at even intervals around the basket top. You can even add some to the handle if you wish.
Consider adding greenery and artificial flowers to finish off the look of the basket. These additions are really up to your needs and imagination.

, Tie lengths of narrow ribbon at each base (or just one) of the basket handle, or use a hot glue gun to attach them if you prefer. The ribbons should trail approximately 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) below the bottom of basket.


You can also tie ribbon bows. These bows will cover any knotted portions of the narrow ribbon streamers.

, Either cluster the flowers on each side of the basket or attach flowers all along the basket's rim or edge. You can attach artificial flowers and greenery by weaving their stems through the open spaces in the basket. The ease with which this is accomplished depends on the structure of the basket. Alternatively, you can use a hot glue gun to attach artificial flowers.


If you’re using fresh flowers, try tying them to the basket with floral wire. Simply, position the flowers on the exterior of the basket, then pass both ends of a length of floral wire over the stem and through to the interior of the basket. Finish by twisting the wire ends to secure them and tuck them back into the basket so that they are hidden.
You can also try covering the entire basket with flowers and greenery, or cascade them down one side with hot glue., You want to save this part till the day of the wedding, preferably right before walking down the aisle if you are using fresh flowers. The number of flowers you place in the basket may depend on the length of the aisle. For example, if it’s a long walk, you will need more petals so the flower girl can throw them out consistently.

Determine what kind of skirt you want your dress to have.,
Determine whether your want your dress to have a train.,
Plan for alterations.,
Enjoy your dress!",How to Dress As a Bride," Pick a venue and theme that best reflects what type of wedding event you want to plan, and you will dress accordingly. A church wedding may require more modest attire while a destination wedding could have something a bit more fashionable.;
, See what dresses and options are out there, and determine how what you like can fit into your ideal wedding gown. If you are brushed up on dresses before you see a sales associate, that will greatly increase the chance that you'll be able to tailor your dress the way that you want.

, Do an Internet search for bridal shops in your area (or out of the area, if you are willing to make the extra trip), and find shops that carry dresses within your budget. Make a spreadsheet with these stores and their location/contact information. Make an appointment to visit each store.


Don't be overwhelmed or nervous! There are a large selection of gowns at every bridal shop, but the assistants are extremely friendly and knowledgeable. They will do their best to make recommendations that suit the personal style and ideal wedding plans you share with them.

, White is traditional, but other off-white/nude colors such as cream, pink, light gold and silver are also popular. Adventurous brides can also experiment with more vibrant colors such as yellow, red, or whatever suits your fancy -- just make sure to still stand out from the bridesmaids!

, This mostly depends on your figure, but when it comes to deciding between equally appropriate options, your personal tastes are factored into the question.


Bustier women may prefer a halter dress or strap/sleeved dress to provide extra support for the chest area.
Women with flatter chests should get a padded bodice with a sweetheart neckline that's not too low. It will also help to get a dress with a train and large pickup on the skirt, to avoid drawing attention to the chest area.
Women with broad shoulders and arms will prefer a style with thick straps or capped sleeves to conceal those areas. A strapless bodice with lots of embroidery and fancy detail will be good for women with a moderate bust to draw attention to the chest and away from the shoulder/arms.

, Because wedding dresses are full and floor-length, you don't have to worry about whether a particular style will flatter your figure or your legs. You can't really go wrong, so pick a style at the wedding store that suits your tastes.

, Although a train provides an elegant and regal touch, they can be annoying to deal with after the ceremony. Some dresses come with a detachable train that can be slipped off for the reception and post-wedding affairs; look out for those.

, Wedding dresses are altered so that they fit you perfectly, so make sure you start shopping for a dress early so that you will have time for the adjustments you need. Your sales associate should help you take measurements and note down what changes need to be made.

, Try it on well before the ceremony for any last-minute adjustments.

You can also look into online sellers or even grocery stores if local florists are too expensive.You should do some general research first. Figure out roughly how many flowers you need and what type you want. This can help you figure out which providers work best with your budget.;
, You don't need to stick to a single shade of purple for your bouquet. In fact, doing so may be a little boring. Try using many different flowers to create varying shades of purple.English cabbage roses, peonies, and sweet peas all come in deep shades that blend well together.
You can also use variation of color with your ribbon. A silver or gold ribbon can pair nicely with purple flowers.

, If you want something purple but a little quirky and fun, look into fuchsia flowers. This will give your bouquet a bright, vibrant color that could work well with a slightly untraditional wedding.Peonies, lavender roses, and orchids all have a fuchsia shade. You could use these combination of flowers for a bright, attractive bouquet.

, Season is important for your wedding. Flowers that are out of season may be harder to find and more expensive. To help with this problem, try to include a few purple flowers that are always in season.Peruvian lilies are lovely light purple flowers. They are in season year-round.
Larkspur come in shades of deep purple and are in season year-round.
Calla lilies are not purple, but can come in light pinks that could compliment a purple bouquet. They are also in season year-round.

, If your wedding is going to be in spring or summer, don't limit yourself to year-round flowers. Seek out beautiful purple flowers that will be in season during your wedding.Irises come in a light shade of purple and peak during summer and spring.
Stock are long flowers with clusters of petals blooming around the stem. They grow in spring and summer.
Anemones are a great shade of dark purple and bloom during the spring. Hyacinths can be lavender or purple and bloom during spring.

, If you're going for a fall wedding, this can change your choices in flowers. Be on the lookout for attractive fall flowers that will make your bouquet a stunning shade of purple.Scabiosas come in shades of purple and bloom during the fall.
Dahlias bloom in fall and come in shades of purple.
Larkspur blooms in both fall and summer and comes in a dark shade of purple.
While not purple, coxcomb come in crimson and burgundy shades that could potentially compliment a purple bouquet.

, If you want a particularly light or dark bouquet, be aware of the flowers you're choosing. Some purple flowers are darker or lighter than others.


Light purple flowers include things like lavender, catmint, and balloon flowers. Flowers like allium have a brighter look, which can compliment lighter colored flowers well.Orchids, which come in purple, tend to have darker leaves. Lisianthus flowers have darker colors towards the centers and look something like purple roses. Morning glories come in purple and have many dark marks on the petals., If this is your first time making a bouquet, a classic style may be easier for you. It can also be helpful to go for a more classic style if you have a more traditional wedding. A classic bouquet has a timelessness that goes well with many weddings.A classic style is simply a dense bunch of flowers that's anchored around a base. It usually forms a dome-like shape.
If you're doing a classic style, you can assemble your flowers however you want. You can, for example, separate them by color or have lighter flowers on the bottom and darker flowers near the top.

, A cascade is a kind of fun, bohemian style. If you're looking for a less traditional wedding, try going for a cascade style.The cascade has a waterfall feel. You anchor all the flowers around a base at the bottom, tying together their stems.
From there, you let flowers hang looser than you would in a more traditional bouquet. The flowers spill out, resembling a tiny floral train.

, A composite bouquet wires all the flowers around a single stem. Instead of bunching all the stems together, you would choose a thick stem. From there, you would wrap the other stems around the center stem. This makes your bouquet look like one giant flower., This can be fun if you're using many different types of flowers. You can create a design in which there are small circles of flowers of different colors. You can group light purples, dark purples, fuchsia purples, and so on to create a nice design with color., If you've never assembled your own bouquet before, professional guidance is recommended. A wedding planner or florist can give you advice on which flowers pair well together and what sort of shape would best match your vision for your special day.It may be particularly helpful to seek professional advice if you're going for a more complicated bouquet shape. Something like, say, a cascade effect may be best achieved via professional services.

, Before you assemble your bouquet, you will have to trim your flowers and cut the stems. Use some floral shears to trim down your flowers, removing uneven or unwanted petals.Cut all the stems to the same length. If you're dealing with roses, remove any thorns.
Trim off any damaged petals from your flowers.
Trim all the stems so they're roughly the same length. This will help you as you form the base of your bouquet.

, Regardless of the shape you're making, you will need to form a square-shaped base from which to build your bouquet. Use one hand to take one stem at a time and add it to your bouquet. With your other hand, fold the stems in place.Start with four flowers. Place them together in a square shape. This will form a sturdy base from which to build upward, creating the perfect shaped bouquet for your wedding.
Build a dome shape, which will also be your base, by adding other flowers circling around the four flower square in the center. Build a base as big as you need for your desired bouquet.
Choose whatever flowers you feel would look best at the base. If you're combining colors, for example, you could place darker purples at the bottom and gradually build your way up., Once you've built as big a base as you want, you will need to secure it in place before continuing your bouquet. The flower stems should naturally join together about 3 to 4 inches from the flower heads. Use some floral tape to gently bind the stems together.Use another piece of floral time to bind the ends of the stems. About 2 inches from the ends of the stems, wrap the stems together with a piece of floral tape.
If you're going to take a break before you continue with your bouquet, place the ends of the stems in water before proceeding.

, Regardless of the shape you're creating, use one flower at a time. Insert the stems of your flowers into the bouquet, gradually building the shape you want. Always work around the square-shaped base you created in order to achieve your desired shape.You can form the shape you want as you add flowers. If you're opting for a traditional bouquet, form a dome shape. If you want a cascade shape, attach the flowers to the base by the very edges of the stems, so the flowers spill outward and create the waterfall effect.
Keep the look you want in mind in regards to color as well. If you want a very uniform bouquet, match flowers based on color and size. If you want a less stringent bouquet, vary the types of flowers. Pair light ones next to dark ones, for example., When you're done with the bouquet depends on your personal preferences and the style you want to create. Once the bouquet is in the shape you want, and the size you want, you should secure it so it stays in shape leading up to your wedding day.Cut your stems so they're all the same length. You should have about 7 to 8 inches of stems at the bottom of the bouquet.
Cut off a piece of ribbon. The ribbon should be about 3 times as long as the full length of the stems.
Tuck one end of the ribbon into the stems near the flower heads. Wrap the ribbon around the full length of the flower stems. Then, secure the ribbon with a couple of pins.
If you want a bow, cut out a separate piece of ribbon and tie it around the stems in a nice bow.

, You do not want your bouquet to go bad before your big day. Gently wrap the bouquet in tissue paper and then store it in the refrigerator. Keep the stems in water.The freshest bouquets are assembled the morning of your wedding day.

Assess if you have the time and talent to do them yourselves. This can be a tremendous cost-saver if you are confident that you can either do silks well in advance or that you think you will have time the day before to put real flowers together.



 


Consider asking a friend or family member to do them for you. Again, this will save you the cost of labor if you trust someone enough to do them for you.






Enlist the help of a professional florist if you have the budget to do it. Professional florists can also be a great source of information because they typically have books that you can look through to help you with your selection decision.





;
, Are you interested in a dome-shaped bouquet, do you want something cascading, or is your preference for a bouquet that will lay in the curve of your arm?

, Your choice may be influenced by color, flower shape, meaning of particular flowers and/or season in which they bloom.

Decide if you want to use silks or live flowers. Silks can be longer lasting, but live flowers will usually appear more realistic and often give a fragrance to the bouquet.






Think about traditional flowers that you can include in your bouquet. These can include roses, daisies, carnations, tulips and hydrangeas.







,

, Take a look at the article from The Knot, found at http://wedding.theknot.com/wedding-planning/wedding-flowers/articles/symbolic-wedding-flower-meanings.aspx?MsdVisit=1, to tell you about flower meaning as well as when each flower is in season.

, Use the tool at http://www.blissweddings.com/weddingfloral/ to help you determine what will work for your area and the time of year that you are getting married.

, Most brides choose ribbon, but you may think about using a different fabric and/or something that is sentimental to you.

Coordinate the color of what you use to bind the bouquet with the rest of your wedding.






Think about nontraditional binding options such as wrapping the bouquet in your father's tie or your grandmother's vintage handkerchief.

Not all types of flowers will go well with the color scheme and atmosphere of your venue, so it's a good idea to account for this when selecting flowers.If you're marrying in a church with lots of reds and oranges, flowers in soft shades like pinks, whites, and creams may not blend in with the scenery. Instead, choose flowers of richer colors.
Think about the spacing of the venue. Large, ornate flowers may be overwhelming in a venue that's already heavily decorated, for example.
If you're working with a professional wedding planner, ask them to visit the venue with you and give you advice on which flowers would work.

, Certain spring flowers produce a lot of pollen. Pollen can irritate guests that have allergies. Sunflowers and chrysanthemums, for example, can generate a lot of pollen. While you can still use these flowers for your wedding, use them in smaller amounts to avoid triggering allergic reactions.If you know guests are coming that have chronic allergies, you may want to ask a florist for recommendations for low-pollen flowers that tend not to irritate allergies.

, Weddings are sometimes unpredictable. Your chosen florist may run out of a particular option or the flowers may not look like you expected. Do not plan your wedding with your heart set on a single flower. Write down a variety of options before talking things over with a florist or wedding planner. When planning a wedding, it's always a good idea to have a backup plan."

Consider Your Dress.,
Assess where the key focal points occur on your dress.,
Consider the style and the level of decoration on your gown.,
Consider the different lengths.,
Consider the width.,
Think about the color.,
Figure out how many tiers.,
Choose what type of extras if any you looking for.,
Look at what type of face shape you have.,
Find out your body type.,
Know what kind of hairstyle you will be wearing.,
Know the location of your wedding.",How to Choose a Wedding Veil," One of the most important considerations is selecting a veil that complements your dress.;
, For example, do you have an embellished bust panel, or perhaps a back detail you’d like to show off? In this case you need to either select a veil that ends before your point of detail, or choose a longer, sheer style that you can see the detailing through.

, In general, if you have quite a simple dress you can carry off a more elaborate veil. However if your dress is very detailed, a simple veil often looks more flattering. Only the most formal of weddings, such as royal weddings, tend to accommodate the combination of both an elaborate dress and veil.


Wedding gowns fall under several different broad styles and your veil needs to work with this style. There’s the classic style, which is formal, symmetrical and usually elaborate in some way. The romantic style possesses an element of softness and usually incorporates lots of attention to detail. The sophisticated style is an understated look that is free from fussy details and the eclectic look is creative with unexpected touches. All of these factors need to be considered when you choose your veil; length, width, color, tiers, and decoration.

,


Very short veils such as visor veils do not extend past the chin. Visor veils resemble fascinators worn to horse-racing events. If your bridal gown has a high neck detail, this type of veil can work well. They are a good style to pair with sophisticated or eclectic style wedding gowns.
Shoulder length veils are around 20 inches (50.8 cm) in length. They are perfectly suited to dresses that have bust,waist, or lower back details. However, they are often too informal for classic, formal dresses.
Elbow length veils are approximately 25 inches (63.5 cm) long, this veil falls to around the elbow. They can work well with romantic ball gown style dresses, because they end where the fullness in the skirt begins.
Waist length veils are just slightly longer than an elbow length veil at approximately 30 inches (76.2 cm). They suit most dress styles that do not feature a train.
Fingertip length veils are one of the most popular lengths, when you stretch your arm out it reaches around your fingertips. They are approximately 36 inches (91.4 cm) long and also suit the majority of dress styles.
Knee length veils are approximately 45 inches (114.3 cm) and reach to around your knees. They look good with mid calf length wedding dresses.
Floor length veils are often referred to as a ballet length veil, they just brush the floor at around 72 inches (182.9 cm). They are well suited to full length gowns that do not have a train.
Chapel length veils are slightly shorter then cathedral length; these veils still drape onto the floor. They are typically around 90 inches (228.6 cm) long. They are best partnered with dresses that feature a train.
Cathedral length veils are the longest and therefore most formal, these veils are usually around 120 inches (304.8 cm) long and some extend up to nine feet along the ground. They work best with full length, classic wedding gowns.

, Veils typically come in three different widths that create varying degrees of fullness at the sides and top.


54 inch (137.2 cm) width is the sleekest version, with limited fullness at the top and sides. If you want to show off a dress detail that is covered by your veil, this type is sheer enough to accommodate. This style hangs behind your shoulders, which means it is ideally paired with dresses that feature decorative straps or sleeves.
72 inch (182.9 cm) width is moderate in height and width. It offers some coverage around the arms, so it is a good match for simple shoestring strap dresses. It tends to have a more romantic feel than the 54 inch (137.2 cm).
108 inch (274.3 cm) width is the widest and has the most fullness on top. It comes around to cover the arms. This style is great if you are wearing a strapless dress and would like some coverage around your arms and shoulders. However, it is likely to look too overdone with a sophisticated wedding dress.

, Your veil needs to be a suitable color match to your wedding gown. There are several white and ivory shades, pinks, beiges and golds. You can also choose between a regular and a shimmer finish. Shimmer veiling offers a distinct shine, which is especially evident under lighting. In contrast regular veiling is matte in appearance. If you want to ensure an exact match, make sure you can order veil swatches to match to your dress.

, You can choose between a one, two and three tier veil. The choice is largely dependent on the style of your dress.


A one tier veil is suited to a sophisticated look, but a romantic dress often benefits from a two or three tier veil. Classic dresses also tend to require at least two tiers. Multiple tier veils suit simple hairstyles because your hairstyle will not be clear to view under the layers.
One of the tiers is typically a blusher. This is the part of the veil that is used to cover the brides face during the start of the ceremony.
Today’s bride is free to choose whether she wants a veil that covers her face or not. It’s a purely personal decision; many brides find the idea of their partner lifting their veil for the first kiss very romantic.
If you want to wear a blusher you need to select a tiered veil that allows you to flip the blusher point over your face, or the back of your head before your first kiss. It is also best to select a veil that reaches at least shoulder length, because a blusher measures around 30 inches (76.2 cm) in length. A veil that is shorter in the back could look strange. Make sure that your blusher is no longer than 30 inches (76.2 cm), because otherwise it might get tangled up in your flowers.

, A veil can be finished in a wide variety of ways. You should select a finish that works with the style of your dress. If your dress is quite simple, you might like to choose a more decorative edge. Structured dresses tend to look good with thicker ribbon edges. Soft, romantic dresses tend to work well with a simply cut edge. It is also a nice idea to subtly mimic any of the details in your dress.

, A veil frames your face, so your face shape is an important denominator in choosing a veil. Consider the following advice for your face shape:



Round face - A round face is virtually as wide as it is long and looks full in appearance. When choosing a veil look for a style that will help make your face look longer and slimmer. It is preferable for your veil to reach at least shoulder length and for it to have some volume on the top of the head. Avoid veils with too much fullness at the sides of the face.

Square face - A square face is typically wide and angular looking. When choosing a veil look for a style that will soften your face and add length. It is preferable for your veil to reach at least shoulder length and for it to have some volume on the top of the head. Circular and cascading styles can help soften the angular nature of your jaw line.

Oval face - An oval face shape in slightly longer than it is wide, similar in appearance to an egg shape. As this face shape is well balanced, you are free to experiment with different veil styles. However, it is a good idea to avoid going extreme in either volume or width, to help maintain your proportions.

Rectangle face - A rectangle face is longer than it is wide and tends to appear narrow and angular. When choosing a veil look for a style that has width around the face, but no height at the top of the head.

, Your veil has the ability to help correct the proportions of your body shape.


If you have a large bust or stomach, you will benefit from wearing a long veil that extends to fingertip length or below. This is because it will help elongate your upper body.
Pear-shaped women tend to look best in veils that end at shoulder, elbow, or waist level. These lengths draw attention to your smaller points, rather then the width of your hips.
Full-figured women should ideally stick to one tier, narrow width veils to avoid adding extra volume to the look of the body. Tall women can typically carry off longer veils, but shorter women tend to suit veils that are waist height or above.

, Your choice in hairstyle plays a role in determining what sort of veil and headpiece you can pull off.

A heavy head piece, long veil, or multi-tiered veil all require a supportive up-do hairstyle like a bun.






A half up/half down hairstyle will work with moderate weights and lengths.






If you intend to wear your hair all down, then it is probably best to stick to lightweight or shorter designs.






You also need to consider the placement position on your head. Some hairstyles suit a veil that is attached to the front of your head, but others look good with veil that is attached further towards the back.
If you have short hair you will need to attach the veil towards the front of your head.
However, if you have long hair and want to show off an elaborate up-do, you will need to position the veil further back. Wide veils typically need to be worn towards the front of your head and veils that do not have gathers look better worn towards the back of the head. Your veil can be attached with a comb and pins or combined with a tiara, crown or headband. It is a good idea to buy your veil well in advance of your wedding date, so that you can take it along to your hair trial.

, You also need to give some practical consideration to selecting a veil that is suitable for your wedding location.


A cathedral style veil is the ultimate show stopper if you are having a formal wedding in a large church, with several attendants. However it could be disastrous in another setting.
If you are getting married in a small chapel, then it is best to stick to chapel length or shorter. This is because you won’t have the room to show off a long trailing veil. Cathedral length veils also require frequent assistance from attendants.
If you are getting married in an outdoor ceremony, there are extra considerations to be mindful of. You may have sand, wind or dirt to contend with. If you’d like to keep your veil in pristine condition, it is advisable to choose a knee length veil or shorter. However, many brides are happy to live it up for the day and aren’t worried about trailing their veil behind them in the sand at the beach, or along a dirt path in a garden setting.
Also bear in mind that in windy settings a long veil can be difficult to control. Visor veils can work well in these conditions.
You might also like to consider the climate. For example; in hot, humid weather it is not going to be pleasant to be swathed in full layers that could stick to your skin.

Many materials, including satin, will fray after being cut. Apply liquid seam sealant to the cut edges to prevent this from happening.
Alternatively, you can use fray-resistant knits and nylons to avoid the issue of fraying altogether.;
, Place one chiffon circle on top of each satin circle. Treat each pair as one piece from this point on.


If desired, this flower can be made with either satin or chiffon instead of using both. In that case, you'll only need to cut the seven 3-inch (7.6-cm) circles of your primary fabric and the one 2-inch (5-cm) felt circle.

, Fold one satin-chiffon pair in half, then fold it in half once more. Repeat with the other six pairs.


The material may unfold once you release it. If this happens, you'll need to work with one circle pair at a time instead of folding all of them at once. Immediately after folding one pair, glue it in place, then do the same for the next pair and the ones after that.

, Place a dot of hot glue in the center of the felt circle. Arrange four of the folded satin-chiffon pairs on top of this circle, pressing the tip of each set into the glue.The pointed tips should all meet together at the center of the felt circle, and the open edge of each set should face in the same direction as the others. All four sets should fit together snugly in a rough circle.
You may need to apply additional hot glue to the ""petals"" directly above the felt. Otherwise, the sets may loosen and fall off as you handle the flower.

, Place another dot of hot glue in the center of the previous layer. Arrange the remaining three satin-chiffon pairs on top, pressing the tip of each one into this new dot of glue.


Position these three sets so that they fill in some of the gaps left between the first four sets. Note that these three sets will face in the same general direction as the first four, but they will not fit together quite as snugly.

, Gently spread apart the petal layers to reveal the center. Glue or sew a decorative button into this center.


After adding the embellishment, use your fingers to carefully spread and fluff the ""petals"" of the flower around its new center.
Set the finished flower aside until you are ready to use it for the fascinator.

, Cut a length of 2-inch (5-cm) wide organza ribbon. Fold this ribbon three times, separating each fold slightly to create a small fan.


The exact amount can vary according to personal taste, but 12 inches (30.5 cm) of organza ribbon will usually work well.
Vary the length of each fold slightly to create more dimension. Hold the fan together by sewing a running stitch across the base of the fan, or by applying a small bead of hot glue in between each folded layer near the base of the fan.

, Arrange three to five fake leaves so that they connect at the bottom tip but fan out along the tops. Fix the leaves together with hot glue.The leaf fan should be tall enough to help balance out the organza ribbon fan. As such, try to use leaves that are roughly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) long.
To vary the design, you could opt for wide craft feathers or fake flower petals instead of fake leaves. If using feathers, choose feathers that vary from the single feather you'll be using later on in these instructions. If using fake petals, separate the petals from the plastic stem before arranging them into a fan.

, Each rectangle should be 1-1/2 inches (3.75 cm) wide and 3 inches (7.6 cm) long.


Both rectangles should be cut from the same color felt. If your organza ribbon is sheer, it might be a good idea to roughly match the color of the felt to the color of the ribbon.

, Place the felt leaves on one end of the rectangle and the organza fan on the other end. Position one large feather in the center, then place the fabric flower on top.


Both fans should fan out to their respective sides. In other words, if you place the leaf fan on the left, the wide outer portion should face to the left. If you place the ribbon fan on the right, the wide outer portion should face to the right.
The center feather should stand vertically in between the two fans, but you can adjust the angle slightly if doing so creates better visual balance.
Ideally, the bottom fabric flower should completely cover the base of the other three embellishments.

, Once you're satisfied with the arrangement, use hot glue or a needle and thread to attach each embellishment to the felt rectangle.


If you choose to sew the decorations instead of gluing them, note that you'll need to attach the feather and leaves by loosely stitching around the shafts of each one. Hide any stitches made into the fabric flower beneath its center button.
Check the base of your decoration. If some of your stitches or glue marks remain visible, consider hiding them with additional beads and gems.

, Place a dot of hot glue on the edge of the blank comb, then press one end of the satin ribbon into the glue.Choose satin ribbon the roughly matches the color of your two felt rectangles. The exact amount may vary, but 36 inches (91.6 cm) will usually be enough.
Use a blank comb measuring roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Shorter combs will not be sturdy enough to support the decoration and longer combs will show through from the underside.

, Wrap the ribbon around the base of the comb, weaving it in between the individual teeth.


Fold the loose starting end over the base of the comb before you begin wrapping. As you wrap, make sure that your initial wraps cover this end and hide it from view.
When you finish, the entire base of the comb should be covered by the ribbon.

, Once you reach the end of the comb base, tie a knot in the ribbon and trim away any excess.


To prevent the cut end of the ribbon from fraying or sticking up, apply a small bead of glue to the end of the base and carefully press the remaining tail into it.

, Glue or stitch the empty felt rectangle to the wrapped ribbon along one side of the comb.


Stick the felt patch to the rounded side of the comb base, and make sure that the length of the patch covers the length of the comb. Only adhere the patch to the base of the comb; do not attach it to the teeth.
If you choose to sew the felt instead of gluing it, sew the felt directly into the ribbon beneath it.

, Place the embellished felt rectangle on top of the felt rectangle attached to the comb. Sew or glue the two together.


Align the edges of the two patches together as evenly as possible. You may need to trim some of the excess to keep the edges clean.
Note that the bottom of the embellished patch must face the teeth of the comb. The upper portion of the patch should point above and away from the comb.
If you choose to sew the felt patches together, use a whip stitch or some type of edging stitch to make the final result look cleaner.

, Examine the fascinator. Use additional gems or charms to cover any messy areas or fill in any blank spots.

, Once all the glue dries, the fascinator should be finished and ready to wear. Stand in front of the mirror and slip the teeth of the fascinator comb into your hair.

Wear a floral crown.,
Try flowers or flower hair clips.,
Invest in a twig head peace.,
Use leaves.",How to Opt for a Bridal Veil Alternative1," A floral crown is a crown of flowers you wear wrapped around your head. It has a lovely, bohemian vibe that can serve to replace your veil if you want something slightly less dressy but still retaining a feminine feel.Floral crowns can be made from real or artificial flowers, depending on your preferences.
A floral crown can easily make use of your wedding colors. For example, if your colors are pinks, you can make a crown using flowers like roses. If your colors are silver, you can try something like baby's breath.;
, If you like flowers but do not want something circling your whole head, you can try wearing flowers or flower clips in your hair. This leaves most of your head and hair exposed, which can be great if you want to show off a particular hairstyle for your big day.Real flowers have a nice, authentic touch, but may wilt throughout the day. However, a florist may be able to treat flowers to keep a fresh look for the duration of your wedding day. If you prefer, however, you can use floral hair clips instead, giving a nod to nature but using slightly more sustainable jewelry.
Flowers can be braided into the hair, tucked behind the ears, or distributed throughout the hair for a more undone look.
As with a floral crown, you can use this to highlight your wedding colors.

, If you're not into flowers, try something that uses pieces of nature like twigs. Real twigs may be difficult to embed in your hair, but you can purchase an artificially made headpiece that is designed to look like twigs. This can help give you a nature look that's slightly less feminine, if that's what you prefer.You can also go for a green crown which features things like herb springs and ivy. This is a look that reflects nature while being slightly less feminine and showy than a floral veil.

, Many headpieces or head bands use real or artificial leaves to give a nod to nature for your big day. Leaves are slightly more decorative than twigs, but not as showy as flowers. They can be a good in-between if you want a nod to nature that's neither too played down or too dressy.You can wear leaves in your hair like flowers, with them tucked behind the ears or braided in. You can also opt for a crown that uses leaves.

Add a barrette or comb.,
Use hair beads.,
Try a headpiece.,
Wear a tiara.,
Use decorative hairpins.",How to Opt for a Bridal Veil Alternative2," You can purchase a decorative comb or attractive barrette at a jewelry store. Before your big day, have the ornament embedded into your hair in place of a veil.Barrettes and combs can work great because they do the work of the veil in terms of keeping your hair out of your face. However, they do not conceal as much of your face and hair as a real veil would.
Combs can be embedded into your hair. You can wear a comb at the top of your head or ton one side, depending on your hairstyle.

, If you want something more fun and bohemian than a traditional veil, opt for hair beads. You can weave beads right into your hair, allowing it to hang loose on your big day.

In addition to beads, you can also weave feathers or chains into your hair.

, Headpieces are often as ornate and memorable as veils, but show off more of your face. If you like the tradition and style of a wedding veil, but want to leave your face uncovered, consider a headpiece. Like veils, they range from subtle to elaborate.If you want something big and showy, opt for an over-the-top headpiece. These usually cover more of your head and the designs are more complex. Something like a very large flower or bow can work well.
If you want something played down, go for a minimal headpiece. These are usually things like small headbands or barrettes.
For a style in-between minimal and elaborate, go for a statement headpiece. These cover more of your head than a minimal headpiece, but the decorations are slightly more played down than an over-the-top piece.

, If you want the princess look for your big day, a tiara is a great option. A tiara can be worn on the tip of your head, holding your hair back. Tiaras work great if you want something very traditionally feminine for your wedding.You can wear a tiara on the top of your head and let your hair hang down or pull part of it back.

Add a headscarf.,
Wear a hat.,
Try a headband.",How to Opt for a Bridal Veil Alternative3," A scarf around your head is kind of like a custom hood. It will keep your hair out of your face and look similar to a veil. However, it will have a more casual, somewhat bohemian vibe than a traditional wedding veil.Scarves can be a way to add a splash of color to your look. If you're still searching for that something blue, for example, add it using your veil.

, If you don't mind veering fairly far off from the traditional, try a hat. Many bridal stores sell bridal hats, which can range from small and subtle to big and ornate. With some searching, it's easy to find a hat that fits your wedding's theme.If you're doing a very specific theme, a hat can be a great veil alternative.

Before shopping for a wedding veil it is essential to know whether you actually need it or not.,
To determine your face shape, pull your hair away from your face and study the outer edge to come to a conclusion.,
Another thing that you need to consider before shopping for a wedding veil is your body type.,
Take an appointment with your hair stylist and sit down with him/her to decide what bridal look suits you best.,
Decide your budget for shopping a wedding veil and fix a date for shopping.,
In case carrying a wedding gown around is not feasible for you can carry a photograph of your wedding gown along with you to show it to the shop.

,
When looking for the perfect veil at the bridal shop, remember that ""opposites attract"".,
Pay close attention to the length of the gown and the detail.,
Choose the length of the veil after deciding how long you plan on wearing it.,
Try different styles of wedding veils before deciding the one you would like to buy.

,
Before purchasing the veil try the veil and check yourself in front of a full-length mirror to ensure that the proportions are right.",How to Choose a Veil That Matches With Your Wedding Gown," The beauty and need of a veil depends very much on the shape of the face of the person who would be wearing it. For instance, your shape could be either Oval or Round or Oblong or Heart or Diamond or Square and even Rectangle and Triangle. While the first four shapes are soft and curved, the last four have more angular cuts. Remember that not every face shape needs a veil to highlight it.;
, Still unsure? Ask your family members or friends to know about the shape of your face.

, A tall bride must wear a veil that is more commanding while for a petite bride, the best purchase would be a very fluffy veil with a large pouf. And brides with thick waistline should go for an asymmetrical veil that cascades varying lengths of tulle down the back.

, A hair stylist can give you an idea about what type of veil will work with the way your hair would be styled on your wedding day.

, Take a friend or family member along with you for a second opinion.

,, For example, if you have a round, full face you can wear a veil that falls along the sides of the face to make your face look narrow.

, In case you have bought an elegantly detailed wedding gown, choose a simple veil. Any sort of ornamentation on your veil should start below where your dress embellishments end.

, If you want to wear it for the ceremony only you can choose a veil with long trails. But if you want to wear your veil until the party's over, go for a shorter veil.

,, Examine the veil from all angles as one that might suit you from the back might not look that flattering from the front.

Buckram is a sturdy material used to form hats. If you cannot find buckram, you could substitute another stiff fabric. Two layers of canvas or cotton lined with interfacing may work.
Use white material or material that matches the color of your hair to prevent the base from being too noticeable.
The size of the base does not need to be exact, but it should be large enough to support the veil yet small enough to be covered by a decoration later on.
Draw the oval on the fabric using a fabric pencil or chalk.
Cut the buckram using sharp sewing scissors or shears.
You could also substitute this stiff base for a more flexible one made of felt. The veil will not have as much form or support, but it will still work as long as you handle the veil with care afterward.
For a playful variation, cut out a heart instead of an oval.The heart should only be visible from the underside of the veil. You could use a cookie cutter or other template to trace the shape onto the fabric, or you could draw the heart free-handedly. Try to make the heart roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) by 3 inches (7.6 cm).;
, Use enough wire to cover the entire perimeter of the oval with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of overlap.


Hat wire is thinner than a wire coat hanger, but it is heavier than chicken wire. If you need to substitute it for another type of craft wire, look for something that you can bend with your fingers but capable of holding its form under minor pressure.
The wire should be directly on top of the oval's edge.
If using a flexible material, like felt, or an unusual shape, like a heart, the wire is not necessary.
Position the overlap so that it extends along the long side of the oval, rather than around the shorter width-side.

, Attach the wire to the buckram oval using a zigzag stitch. You can make the stitch using a sewing machine or by hand.


Some may find it easier to stitch the wire to the base as you bend it instead of waiting until after the wire is fully formed.
Use thread that matches the color of your buckram oval.
Make sure that you sewing machine has the ability to do a zigzag stitch. There should be a specific setting on your machine, and the machine will need to have a needle that can move from side to side.
Follow your sewing machine's instructions regarding how to set the length and width of the stitch. You will need a moderately long stitch to cover the wire, but the width will need to be set on the low side of the middle.
Sew as usual. Start sewing on one side of the wire. As your press the pressure foot and move the material, the needle should move from side to side. Adjust as needed to allow the needle to cross over both sides of the wire.
To hand sew the stitch, push the threaded needle on the inner side of the wire through the back of the fabric.
Pull the thread through and cross it over the wire in a small diagonal.
Loop it around to the back of the fabric again and push it through the underside of the fabric so that it comes out directly next to your original stitch. Continue in this pattern all the way around the wire.

, Use your hands to gently bend the wire, giving the entire base a slight curve.


The curve should match the curve of your head or hairstyle. The base will rest to the side of your head, near the back, so try to form a curve that is suitable for that position.

, Hand stitch a small side hair comb along the long side of the oval base.


The comb should have no handle and should be roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) smaller than the length of the oval.
This comb will need to be inserted into your hair style and is, ultimately, what will keep the veil in place.
Use the same thread you used when attaching the wire.
Weave the thread in between the top of the teeth at both ends of the comb. Do not stitch along the entire top of the comb; only use enough thread to hold the comb in place at the ends.

, The veiling should be roughly 18 inches (46 cm) wide.


Use white Russian veiling or a similar type of net veiling. Russian veiling has a sturdy diamond-shaped net appearance, with gaps that are roughly 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) in size. This style is more fitting for a birdcage veil than delicate veiling is.
You can usually find veiling at fabric stores, bridal stores, or online.

, Fold the veiling in half and trim away the top pointed corner of the open side of the veiling.


Do not trim away the bottom corners and do not trim away the top corner of the folded side.
You only need to cut as much as necessary to round off the corner.
Use a wheel-style fabric cutter if possible. If not, sewing shears or scissors will also work.

, Unfold the veil and gather it up as you weave the needle and thread in and out of each joint or gap.


Knot the thread to the bottom corner of the veiling. The thread should already be attached to the needle, and you should have enough to make it through the entire length of the veil.
Weave the needle and thread in and out of the veiling gaps along the edge of the veil. You should be sewing lengthwise, from corner to corner, along the 1-yd (91-cm) side of the veil.
Gather the veiling slightly as you weave the thread through it. Do not pull the thread as tightly as possible, though. The veiling should be loosely bunched up, not tightly held together.
The final length of this gathered side should be about 2 inches (5 cm) longer than the length of the base.
Finish your stitch by knotting the thread to the other corner of the veiling.

, Hand sew the veil to the base using a zigzag stitch over the edge of the veiling.


The veiling should be placed more toward the center of the base instead of the edge. The middle of the gathered veiling should roughly align to the middle of the oval base.
Curve the veiling around the base so that the corners of the gathered section reach the bottom of the base. Do not bring the corners together. Instead, there should be at 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of space along the edge of the base separating the corners of the veiling.

, Two of the flowers should have five petals while the third, and largest, should have six.


Note that if desired, you can skip this step and use a pre-made fabric flower purchased from a craft store or bridal store.
The cardboard should be fairly thin and flexible. If you do not have cardboard, heavy cardstock or construction paper would also work.
Draw the flower shapes by hand using a pencil before cutting them out with scissors or a crafting razor.
The size of the flowers do not need to be exact, but they should be large enough to mask the base of the veil when attached. Make the largest flower about 7 to 8 inches (18 to 20 cm) in diameter, the middle flower roughly 6 to 7 inches (15 to 18 cm), and the smallest flower approximately 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm). The length of the petals should be about the same size as the center of each flower, if not a little smaller.

, Place the cardboard flowers onto white cotton and lightly trace the shape with a sewing pencil or chalk.


After tracing the flowers onto the fabric, cut the shapes out of the fabric using sewing scissors or shears. Make the edges as smooth as possible.
You could also look for a type of lightweight fabric that is ravel-proof to avoid having a flower that becomes ragged over time.
You only need to use one layer of fabric for each shape, giving you three flower-shaped cutouts of white fabric when done.

, The biggest flower should be on the bottom and the smallest should be on top.


Alternate the petals. Align the five-petal flowers so that the petals of the top flower fill in the gaps left between the petals of the middle flower. Arrange these top two flowers so that all the gaps between the petals of the bottom flower are also filled.

, Fold the stack of flowers in half three times.


Fold the stack in half from side to side.
For the second fold, fold the stack in half from top to bottom. The stack should now be a quarter of its original size.
For the final fold, bring the two straight edges together, forming a triangular shape.
Peel the petals out. Hold the folded stack together by the point and carefully peel the petals outward, creating the appearance of a blooming flower.

, Continue holding the tip of the flower as you hand sew the pieces together.


Make the stitch above the point at which you're holding the flower together. There should be roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of fabric below the stitch line.
Weave the needle and thread through all the layers of the flower, binding them together. Make several stitches by weaving the needle through several times, securing the flower from one side to the other.
Knot both ends of the thread to hold the flower in place.

, Sew the flower to the top of the buckram base, matching the center of the flower to the center of the base. This finishes your veil.


Bend the point of the flower so that it lies flat against the base. Sew the flower onto the base near the stitch line of the flower in order to maintain the flower's shape.
Rearrange the petals of the flower as needed to camouflage the base.

,


For a classic 1940s style veil, consider using black veiling and a black, feathery flower.
To add a touch of “something blue,” use baby blue veiling. Alternatively, you can use white veiling and a baby blue flower or pin.
Weave your wedding colors into the design by using a flower that matches one of the colors in your wedding. To further blend things together, you could decorate your veil with a pre-made cloth flower designed to look like one of the flowers in your wedding bouquet.

, Fake feathers can give your veil added vintage-inspired style.


You could use feathers to accent the flower by positioning a few in between the flower and the base. Sew or glue them in place using a hot glue gun.
You could also make the feathers the primary focus of your veil. Glue the feathers in a fanned-out, half-circle arrangement, positioning the arrangement so that the feathers fall down the side of your head or across the top. You could leave the feathers as they are, or you could add a touch of bling with a small brooch placed at the connecting point of the feathers.
Alternatively, you could glue three or four feathers across the length of the base so that they come around the top of your head in headband-style.

, Instead of attaching flowers, pin a large brooch or a series of smaller brooches to the base.


Note that you may want to form a smaller base if you do this to prevent it from showing through.

, Hand stitch lace edging to the bottom of your veil.


Use a delicate lace pattern so that it does not compete with the decoration on top of the veil or block your vision.
Attach the lace to the veil before you bunch the veiling up and attach it to your base. The trim should extend from one rounded end of the veil to the other, so you will need roughly 1 yard (91 cm) of lace trim.

Make sure you leave yourself enough time for a second and possibly third fitting in case the dress does not fit right.,Keeping The Bridal Dress Perfect on The Wedding Day

,
There are steps you can take to make sure the dress stays clean and wrinkle free on the big day.,
In outdoor weddings, watch out for ledges where birds may be resting.",How to Find the Perfect Bridesmaid Dresses," We also recommend thumbing through the more popular wedding magazines, such as Bride's and Modern Bride magazines. It is recommended that the bride go shopping with one or two of her bridesmaids and see what styles they like. Once you narrow it down, you can then get input from your other bridesmaids if you desire.;
,, The hottest styles right now are two-tone, two-piece floor length styles, mostly sleeveless. Also very popular are column style dresses, floor length, halter top or straps criss-crossing over the back and sleeveless. Another big trend is having a shawl accompany the dress, particularly the barer styles.

, There is also a trend toward burgundy and hunter for Fall weddings too. Black is always in style and always a popular choice among both brides and their bridesmaids. In addition, many of the designers today are also using better quality fabrics like dupioni silk, silk chiffon and satin, velvet and crepe.

, You could apply some simple rules - no dress above the knee, or no strapless dress (or whatever look you want for your wedding). Another popular and pretty trend, especially for spring and summer weddings, is a ""color run"". That means that each bridesmaid wears a different color of the same dress.

, For example, it would not be wise to choose a short cut and strapless bridesmaid dress during the winter, while a heavy material during the summer in an outdoor ceremony.

,,,,, This way you can cross reference them with the size chart for the manufacturer you have selected in order to ensure you order the size that is closest to their figure. Each designer uses a different size chart so you won't be able to assume that a size 8 from manufacturer ""A"" will fit the same way a size 8 does from manufacturer ""B"".

,, However, some retailers also have an online presence and offer good discounts.

,, As a result, it is strongly recommended that you order your dresses as soon as you have made a decision on the dress you want. Different manufacturers have different lead times. You will also want to leave enough time for alterations - usually at least 3 weeks before the wedding if not sooner.

, If you don't order the dresses one at a time, the dresses might not all be from the same dye-lot so they might not all be the exact same color.

,, As the bride, when you look back on your wedding, you probably won't care as much about what your bridesmaid dresses looked like, as much as you will care about how they felt. Their budgets, personalities, shapes, sizes and opinions should all be factored in to your decision. When it comes down to the bottom line it is your decision because it is your wedding. However, try not to forget that the reason they are standing up in your wedding is because they are the ones that have been there for you in your life. You don't want to embarrass them or make them uncomfortable just for your happiness. Although some dresses are more reusable than others, eventually all styles go out of fashion. However, your friends and family never will go out of style and will always be needed.

, This is your dear friend or relative's special day and you want her to be happy too. Don't let a dress that you may only wear for one day get in the way of your long time friendship that will hopefully last a lifetime to come. If you really don't like the dress, take it to a local consignment store soon after the wedding while it is still in style. Best months are in the Spring - right before prom season and in the Fall - right before homecoming. Otherwise you can donate it to a local charity. Someone else out there will love the dress and be thrilled to get a bargain. Then you will have made another person happy too!

, This will surely make her man happy on their wedding night!

,, Dress planning is extremely important. Bridesmaid101 has listed below some important times to be aware of:


Shopping For The Dress
First Fitting
Shoe Shopping
Picking Up The Dress

, Many girls wait until less than a week before the wedding to pick up their dress only to find out it doesn't fit well and there is not enough time to send it back. The best advice is to help the bride shop early (If she wants help) and to try on the dress the day you receive a phone call that the bridesmaid dresses have arrived.

,, Below are some great tips in making the bridal dress and bridesmaid dresses a success:


Make sure to choose types of flowers that don't stain. You can also ask your florist for this information as well as to remove any parts of the flowers that may stain the dresses (if possible).
Bring an iron and spray bottle with you. It is also helpful to remember an extension chord and mini ironing board if possible.
A garment bag is key to making sure the dress stays nice, especially if you are going to change.
Use both a deodorant and antiperspirant on the big day since both will help in keeping your bridal dress clean.
If you are doing your makeup, make sure to do it before your dress is on and if you have to touch up the makeup after the dress is on, use a towel or some drape cloth to make sure no smudge hits the dress.
Use barrettes or something to hold the long dresses up so they do not get dirty on the ground before walking down the isle or taking pictures.
Make sure to think the worst when getting into a car, leaning or sitting down that there may be something dirty you will be pressing against. Always make sure to wipe off or look at what you are pressing against whether sitting or leaning.

, If you're struggling to find a bridesmaid dress you like, look outside the bridesmaid section. You can look outside the box a little by examining other formal dresses.

The bride may want a particular style for her wedding. There may be religious or other cultural customs to follow. For example, the bride may want modest dresses, so you will have to make sure not to pick anything too revealing.

, The type of bra you wear under a dress can make a big difference. Some bras may look lumpy or awkward with certain cuts. If you go for a strapless dress, you will need a strapless bra.

, Select a dress that will allow her to be active, while still looking fancy. Look for sturdy straps and secure necklines so the dress will stay on. Also find a dress that is loose-fitting and will allow her to move easily., Look for dresses in fabrics that will feel comfortable and will look good, even if your flower girl is especially active. For example, make sure the fabric won’t itch or irritate her skin. Also try finding something in a wrinkle-free fabric or a fabric that will hide wrinkles, like chiffon.

Choose a length.,
Plan for growth.,
Have her try it on.",How to Choose a Flower Girl Dress2," Find a length that is suitable to her age. Choose a shorter dress for a very young flower girl, so she won’t trip on the hem.

Decide who will pay.,
Find dresses in different price ranges.,
Be direct about costs.",How to Choose a Flower Girl Dress3," Talk to the parents of your flower girl about who will pay for the dress. If necessary explain that traditionally the flower girl’s parents will pay for the dress. Offer to pay for a more expensive dress if that dress is very important to you., Pick dresses in different price ranges so the flower girl’s parents have options that can fit their budget. Look in different types of stores -- children’s shops, bridal stores, department stores, and online -- to find things you like in different price ranges.

Consider asking them how much they can spend if you’re comfortable doing so. That way you can focus on finding dresses in their price range.

Gently explain why you object to the dress.,
Be honest.,
Stay calm.",How to Object to a Bridesmaid or Mother Dress for a Wedding1," If one of your bridesmaids has selected a dress that you don't like, you should clearly but respectfully voice your opinion. For instance, maybe one of your bridesmaids chose a dress that you feel is too tight for their body type. Rather than saying ""The dress looks too tight on you,"" try saying ""I was hoping for a more loose and flowing look."" This way you are not attacking the dress, but providing an alternative style.


In a similar way, if the bride wants you to wear a colour that doesn't look good on you, try saying ""Is it possible to find a darker shade? I look washed out."";
, If you don't want to wear a certain dress because you don't like the colour, cost, or cut, be honest with the bride. Avoid saying that you don't like the style if the real issue is that you can't afford the dress. The bride will likely continue to look at dresses in that price range and you will not actually solve the problem.


Instead, pull the bride aside and have a private conversation about your budget. This way you do not need to reveal your financial situation to the entire wedding party.
You could say ""I am on a tight budget and can only spend about $200-$250 on a dress. I am a little embarrassed about the situation, so can we just keep that between us.""
The bride is likely a close friend or relative and should honour your request.
Be sure to express your concerns early in the process because delaying the conversation can cause problems for everyone.

, These types of conversations can be very difficult and emotions can often run high during the wedding planning process. Stay calm while you are objecting to a dress. Avoid raising your voice or yelling at the bride, bridesmaid, or mother-of-the-bride. Remember that everyone is slightly stressed and that you all want the wedding to be beautiful. By staying calm throughout the conversation, it is more likely that you will come to a resolution rather than start a fight.


For example, take a deep breath before you have a serious conversation about objecting to a dress. Use a level tone of voice and try and vocalize your opinion in a rational and mature manner.
Say something like ""I know you feel that a nude coloured dress is too light on your skin tone, but this is the colour I want for my wedding. I am thinking we could add colourful jewelry and shoes to help brighten the outfit.""
This approach demonstrates that you understand the concerns and have come up with some form of compromise.

Remember not every person will look good in the same type of dress.,
Go for a classic style.,
Choose a suitable color or group of colors.,
Don't be afraid to change your mind.,
Pick a light fabric for summer.,
Pick warmer fabrics for cooler months.,
Think about how your bridesmaids will be able to move.,
Consider how the dress will transfer to the reception.,
Let them choose the neckline.,
Give them free range on the dress design.,
Let them pick from several specific colors.",How to Choose Versatile Bridesmaid Dresses," It's difficult to pick one dress that will fit multiple body types. You may find one that fits several people well and not others. Keep that in mind as you look for a universally ""good"" dress.For instance, a dress with a well-defined waistline looks good on a person with an hourglass figure, while a pear-shaped person looks better in a dress with a fitted top and a slightly fuller skirt. People who are apple-shaped look best with something that draws the eye upward, while people who are larger up top need some volume around the hips for balance.;
, One way to make sure the bridesmaids' dresses are more versatile is to pick a classic, sophisticated style. That is, trends are fun, but they may be out of style in a year. If you pick something classic, that dress will be something the bridesmaids can wear for years.For instance, minimalist dresses with a few smart touches, like an interesting hem, stay in style.Alternatively, go for a slightly retro look, like a 1950s-style dress with a high waist, fitted top, and flared skirt.
This year's trendy pattern may seem like a good idea now, but you may look back on that floral print in 10 years and wonder what you were thinking. Solid colors always stay in style.

, When choosing a color, try to think about what will look the best on the most people. For instance, darker colors tend to be more flattering than lighter colors. Plus, a color like navy will make the dress more wearable later., You may have a certain style in mind, but after several bridesmaids try it on, you may realize it's not the right look for everyone. Don't be afraid to make a change and help your bridesmaids feel more comfortable.However, don't hold out for universal support. That is, bridesmaids hating their dresses is a cliche for a reason.

, If you are planning an outdoor summer wedding, you need to pick a fabric that won't be sweltering. Organza is a good choice, as it is light and airy, as is chiffon. These fabrics breathe, allowing your bridesmaids to be more comfortable., Even if you're having your wedding indoors, you'll likely want some outside pictures with your wedding party. Make sure to think about that when picking a fabric for your dresses. Heavier fabrics, such as silk or satin, are a better choice for winter.If you're not sure about the weather, think about adding in coordinated shawls or pashminas as part of the wedding party's outfit., While very formal dresses look pretty, think about your bridesmaids being in them for an extended period of time. If you're planning on having a huge dance party at the reception, you might want to pick something that's a little more easy-going, such as a cocktail dress., Make sure to pick a style of dress that's fun AND comfortable enough to get your bridesmaids through the reception, too. Of course, you can allow your bridesmaids to change, but if you want a cohesive look through the reception, you may need to pick a dress that will work in both the wedding and reception.


For instance, a Victorian-style dress with a big bustle may seem fun for a theme wedding, but are you going to make your bridesmaids wear that to the reception, too?
If you want to do a Victorian-themed wedding, maybe you could include Victorian styling in the design of the dress (such as a fitted jacket over a full skirt), while leaving out the bustle and the floor-length part of the equation.

, One way to let your bridesmaids have a say in their dresses is to pick a type of dress, then let your bridesmaids choose the neckline. Your wedding party will still look cohesive, as long as you have the same length and color of dresses.For instance, some bridesmaids may like a plunging v-neck, while others may prefer a more demure boat, jewel, or scoop neckline.

, Another option is to pick the color and a brand/designer, then let the bridesmaids choose the dress itself. That way, they can choose something that they feel comfortable in and find more flattering. Also, they'll be more likely to get more wear out of it.However, you may want to set a few parameters on design to make the look more cohesive. For instance, you may only want knee-length to floor-length dresses, and you can specify that.
You can also set the fabric. For instance, you may only want lightweight, summery fabrics, which narrows down the choices.
Nonetheless, if you stick to one designer, you should get a fairly cohesive set of dresses.

, Another way to create a cohesive look while letting the bridesmaids have some options is to go with a set of three colors. The colors can be complementary, or they can be the same color in different tones, such as light blue, royal blue, and navy.In this style, you can go for dresses that are all the same style for a more cohesive look, or be a little more free-flowing with dresses in different styles.

Agree on a few specific guidelines.,
Look at other dresses that meet the requirements.,
Choose individual dresses.",How to Object to a Bridesmaid or Mother Dress for a Wedding2," In order to suggest alternative dresses everyone should agree on some shopping guidelines. For example, have a list of ""must have's"" so that the bride, bridesmaids, and mother-of-the-bride are all on the same page while shopping for alternative dresses. Come to an agreement on the colour, length, style, and material. That way it will be easier to find an alternative dress.


For example, you might agree that the dress must be cocktail length, with a sweetheart neckline, strapless, and in a light pink colour.

, In some instances the bride or another member of the wedding party, may select a dress that you do not like. Perhaps you don’t like the style or the way the dress looks on your body type. Rather than saying “There is no way I would be seen in public wearing that hideous dress!” you could say “I like the colour of that dress, but let’s try on some other styles.""This way you are not outwardly objecting to the dress or hurting someone's feelings, but you are providing alternative options.
Actively search for another dress that you like that meets the bride’s requirements (i.e. colour, length, material, etc.)
This also works if you are the bride and one of your bridesmaids or your mother has chosen a dress that you do not like.

, A growing trend for many bridal parties is for the bridesmaids to have different dresses. For instance, the bride can select a colour or shade and then the bridesmaids can each choose their own dress as long as it is the right colour. This way each individual bridesmaid can take their own body shape and budget into consideration when selecting a dress.If the bride has a particular look in mind, ask that all of the bridesmaids get the bride's approval before they purchase a dress. This allows the bridesmaids to have more freedom with their dress selection, but still gives the bride the final say.
In some instances the bride will want the mother-of-the-bride dress to be the same colour as the wedding party.

Have an open mind.,
Shop together.,
Take body type into consideration.,
Set boundaries in advance.",How to Object to a Bridesmaid or Mother Dress for a Wedding3," If you are a bridesmaid or mother-of-the-bride it is important to remember that this is not your wedding. Your role is to support your friend or daughter throughout their wedding day. As a result, you should not be overly picky when it comes to selecting a bridesmaid or mother dress.For example, you may not like the colour that the bride has selected because it doesn’t look good on your skin tone. Major decisions, such as wedding colours, are outside of your control. You should just go along with it.
Alternatively, if you are the bride you want to make sure that your mother and wedding party are comfortable. Be considerate and take their opinions into consideration.

, If the bride has a specific style, colour, or length of dress in mind for the mother-of-the-bride and bridesmaids dresses, then shop for the dresses together. This way the bride can make sure that all of the dresses selected fit with the look she is going for. It also provides the bridesmaids and mother-of-the-bride the opportunity to give their opinions about the dress.


This makes everyone feel as though their voice is being heard and it is less likely that people will object to the dress if they played a role in choosing the dress.

, Body type is often a touchy point when it comes to selecting dresses. It is very rare for all of the bridesmaids to have the exact same body type, which can make selecting a dress difficult. As the bride, you should take the body types of the bridesmaids and your mother into consideration when you are selecting a style of dress.


For example, a mermaid style dress can be very flattering on people with curves, however, it doesn't look good on all body types.
Ask for input from your bridal party and mother and don't just select a dress and expect everyone to feel comfortable.

, If there are certain colours or styles of dress that you will not wear or if you have a set budget, you should talk with the bride about this prior to accepting a position in the bridal party. If you talk about these things openly and honestly in advance of shopping for a dress, is is less likely that there will be major problems concerning the dress selection.For example, when your friend asks you to be a bridesmaid you can say “I would love to be in your wedding party, but I am on a fairly tight budget right now. I can only spend about $1,000 in total, including dress, shoes, hair, and makeup. Is this going to be a problem?”

When in doubt, go for business casual.",How to Dress for a Rehearsal Dinner," The bride and groom or the groom's parents will have sent you an invitation noting the details of the rehearsal dinner. In addition to the time and date of the event, some invitations note the style of dress the hosts wish for guests to wear. Here are some of the different styles of dress you may see listed on a rehearsal dinner invitation:


Black tie. This style is more common for the actual wedding day, but you may see a request for black tie attire on a rehearsal dinner invitation. Men should wear a tuxedo to a black tie event, while women should wear a cocktail dress or long evening gown.
Formal or black tie optional. A formal or black tie optional event indicates that the suggested attire is slightly less formal than a black tie event. Men may wear a tuxedo, but could also wear a dark suit and tie. Women may wear a cocktail dress, dressy suit or evening gown.
Dress for a ""beach formal"" event. If the invitation states that the rehearsal dinner is beach formal, be prepared for an elegant event held outdoors. Guests should dress for the elements, including sun and sand. Men may wear a lightweight suit with a linen shirt, or khaki or linen pants with a cotton button-down shirt. Ties typically are not required at beach formal events. Women may wear a tea-length or knee-length sundress.
Select appropriate attire for a ""semi-formal"" or ""dressy casual"" rehearsal dinner. For men, semi-formal attire indicates a suit and tie. A dark suit is recommended for evening events, while lighter colors may be appropriate for a daytime event. However, as most rehearsal dinners are held in the evening, darker colors are recommended. Women may wear a cocktail dress or a dressy skirt and top to a semi-formal dinner.
Dress for a ""casual"" event. While casual dress to some people may mean jeans and shorts, in most cases that is not appropriate attire for a rehearsal dinner unless specifically noted on the invitation. Men should wear dress pants with a polo or button-down shirt to a casual rehearsal dinner. Women should wear a dress, or skirt or pants with a dressy blouse.;
, If the invitation doesn't state what type of attire to wear, there are other clues to examine. You can determine a lot about how to dress based on the time of day the dinner is taking place. If it's on the earlier side, say 5:00 pm, it's probably more of a happy hour or cocktail hour, which would imply less formal dress than a full dinner beginning at 7 or so.


Some rehearsal meals are not dinners, but lunches or brunches. If this is the case, the attire will probably be slightly less formal.
The time alone is not usually enough to give you a clear indication of what to wear, so take other factors into account along with this one.

, This is probably the most important factor to take into account when you're deciding what to wear. Fine restaurants may have a dress code, requiring men to wear jackets and ties, for example. More casual establishments won't have a dress code, and neither will most outdoor functions. In these cases you'll have to use your own discretion to figure out what's appropriate to wear.

, The wedding theme can indicate appropriate rehearsal dinner attire. In general, select rehearsal dinner attire similar to the wedding attire, except less elegant. For example, a beach wedding will likely have a relaxed atmosphere at the rehearsal dinner, which would suggest sundresses for women and slacks with polo shirts for men. A very traditional wedding might suggest classic semi-formal attire for the rehearsal dinner, such as suits for men and cocktail dresses for women.

, If specified on the invitation, the type of food served can indicate the formality of the event. For example, a clambake on the beach may suggest casual attire, while a five-course meal may suggest semi-formal attire.

, If you're worried there's a dress code and you aren't sure what it is, it's perfectly fine to call either the venue or the host to find out what will be appropriate. There's no need to go into great detail about what you intend to wear; just ask whether the event will be formal, semi-formal, or informal. After that, it's up to you to pick out the right outfit.

, Silk, chiffon, and fine knits are right for a formal or informal rehearsal dinner. Avoid wearing inexpensive cotton or polyester. Go for a fabric that looks tasteful and elegant, and make sure it isn't too sheer.


Women can wear dresses made of most anything but denim or inexpensive polyester.
Men should go for suits or tuxedos made of wool. If it's summertime, a lighter fabric is fine.

, When you're dressing for a rehearsal dinner that's formal or semi-formal nature, go for tasteful, classic cuts that don't reveal too much or stand out from the crowd more than necessary. You don't want to upstage the bride and draw attention to yourself.


Either floor-length or cocktail-length dresses are appropriate.
Don't wear a dress too high above the knee.
Men should stick with suits that are cut in a classic tuxedo style, paired with a white shirt and a black bow tie and cummerbund.

, The colors you wear should be in keeping with the season. Go for jewel tones and darker hues in the fall or winter, and pastels or bright colors during the spring and summer.

, Women should wear high heels or dress flats that match their dresses, while men should wear leather dress shoes in black or dark brown.


Avoid wearing sandals or casual pumps.
Men should shine their shoes if they are scuffed.

, Many informal rehearsal dinners take place in an outdoor setting. Be sure to bring a sweater or jacket that matches your nice dress or suit so you'll still look appropriate even when you add a layer to your outfit.

, Since you'll be going to the wedding the next day, you don't want to wear something fancier than your wedding day attire. Save your most formal, prettiest dress for the day of the wedding, and wear something more understated to the rehearsal dinner., If the event doesn't specify that it's ""black tie,"" but you'd still like to wear something on the fancier side, business casual is usually fine. Gray, navy, black, or dark red business-style dresses or pantsuits are appropriate for most rehearsal dinners. For men, suit pants, a jacket and tie of the sort you would wear to a business meeting will usually fit in well.

Wrap the bouquet with ribbon to hide the stem of the bouquet holder.,
Keep your bouquet cool and moist.",How to Arrange a Cascade Bridal Bouquet," Good bouquet holders contain floral foam and wicks capable of providing water to the flowers. Holders that have slanted handles rather than straight handles are ideal for cascading bouquets.
, Using professional-grade flower food is an important step in extending the life and freshness of the flowers in your bridal bouquet., A finished bouquet can get heavy, and it may cause a non-weighted vase to topple over. Use stones, marbles, or coins to weigh the vase down., Use two smaller stems of greenery to form the upper edge of the triangle along the top of the bouquet. The longest stem of greenery should drape downward, forming the lowest point of the triangle.

The heads of the flowers will extend past the greenery by approximately half a head, so you should determine the length of your greenery based on how large you want the finished bouquet to be.

, Do not fill in every empty spot. If you do, you will run out of bare foam for your flowers. Instead, use just enough greenery to connect and expand your basic frame.

Do not make your greenery flat. The greenery should form a slight dome when viewed from the side.

, The focal flowers should be the largest flowers and should match the main color used in your wedding's theme. They must face directly outward when viewed from the front., Line the flowers along the outside edge of the bouquet, allowing them to extend just a little further out than the tips of your greenery.

You must trim the flowers' stems based on their position in the bouquet. Flowers cascading down toward the bottom point of the bouquet must have longer stems than flowers at the top of the bouquet.

, Position the flowers so that they do not all face forward. Instead, you should have flower heads that face outward at every angle.

Front flowers should face straight out when looking at the bouquet directly.
The next circle of flowers from the center should tilt away from the center.
The final circle of flowers, along the edge of the bouquet, should face straight out to the sides.

, A secondary flower can be an entirely different flower, or it can be the same flower in a different hue or size. Tuck them into the empty gaps left between your primary flowers. The stems should be shorter than those belonging to primary flowers., Filler flowers, such as baby's breath and miniature roses, have small stems and are useful in covering any blank spots or exposed hardware., Use a satin ribbon or one made of similarly glossy material to create an elegant appearance., Store it in a refrigerator or similarly cool place until the ceremony.

If your bouquet holder has a wick, keep the flowers in a weighted vase filled halfway with water.
If your bouquet holder does not have a wick, frequently mist the flowers and the foam using a water bottle.

Your bridesmaids will appreciate the opportunity to wear pants on the bottom but with the ease of one garment. You can opt for a jumpsuit with wider cut legs for the effect of a dress when standing, too. Your look will be much more cutting edge and fun to dance in than your average dress.Jumpsuits allow a lot of versatility and come in any number of lengths and sleeves, so you can pick a style that suits any season.
If your wedding is retro, jumpsuits can call to mind the swinging 1970s, an era in which they enjoyed a lot of popularity.;
, Steer clear of typical long dresses, and opt for a skirt and top set. This allows you to do one color or pattern on the top and another on the bottom, adding some unusual interest to your look. If your bridesmaids are adventurous, you could try a trendy crop top for an unique wedding look.A lace top with an A-line silk skirt, for example, would be a refined alternative to a dress for a backyard wedding.
A skirt with pockets would be a neat alternative for a casual affair with a picnic reception.

, Much like skirts and tops, opting for pants allows you to do one pattern or texture on the bottom of your look and another on the top. Pants allow your bridesmaids to cut a rug comfortably, too. They also come in a variety of styles to match your aesthetic, whether you choose harem pants for a bohemian affair or pleated slacks for a formal ceremony., Dresses are the standard uniform for bridesmaids, but that doesn’t mean you can’t put your own spin on things. Take your wedding theme to a cool and unexpected place with your dresses.


For a nautical wedding, try sashes with a rope effect to call sailing knots to mind.
For a steampunk wedding, embrace corseting and buckled accents for a unique look.

, The typical bridesmaid dress is long to match that of the bride. That said, a different length dress can provide a fresh take on the normal bridesmaid uniform. You can use the length of your dress to drive home the theme or use it to show off a cool accessory that’s unique to your look.


Try short fringed dresses for a roaring ‘20s bash.
For a farmhouse wedding, high-low hemmed dresses could show off tall cowboy boots.

, For an unexpected twist on the traditional monotone bridesmaid garb, choose a color palette. This can mean you pick clothes in a mix of your wedding colors or multiple shades of one color for an ombre effect. This strategy breaks the mold from the standard bridesmaid apparel where everyone looks exactly the same.For a beach wedding, you could try bridesmaid attire in shades of blue to call the ocean to mind.
For a fall wedding, you could choose rich jewel tones in burgundy, gold, forest green, and navy.

, If you want traditional dresses, mix up the look by choosing an unusual pattern. Floral prints could accent a romantic wedding; chevrons could enhance a modern affair; and stripes could add some panache to a nautical wedding. Look for a pattern that reinforces the theme of your wedding but is still subtle enough not to distract from the greater effect.For a ‘50s wedding, try polka dots or other retro prints.
For a tropical wedding, embrace the scenery with a palm leaf print, for example.

, Whether you opt for lace, linen, or even a sequined fabric, choose pieces with different fabrics and textures to add visual interest to your bridesmaids’ apparel. This is an especially easy strategy if you choose separates. You can do a some beading on the top, for example, and a more muted solid on the bottom for a balanced look that still seems fresh.Rather than selecting bridesmaid dresses that all look the same, you could dress half the bridesmaids in a solid color and half the bridesmaids in a sequined version of that same color for more visual interest.
A casual look on top, like a button up, with a more formal look on the bottom, like a silk skirt, can add some cool chic to your look.

, If you’re a go-with-the-flow bride who wants to leave things open to your bridesmaids, select a theme for their apparel rather than a particular outfit. Your bridesmaids various takes on bohemian, romantic, and modern, for example, are sure to be full of different colors, patterns, and textures that are all different but adhere to the same idea. Be sure to outline any necklines or sleeves that aren’t okay with you beforehand.


For a New Years Eve wedding, you could give your bridesmaids free rein to choose from long dresses in metallic shades.
For a bohemian wedding, you could let your bridesmaids chose from lacy looks in their favorite colors.
If your bridesmaids are selecting their own outfits, it can be helpful to send them ideas of unmatched looks online that you’d like to emulate.

, If you want a look that stands out without going too nontraditional, bold shoes can be an understated but unique way to express yourself. Try a vibrant color, such as blue or red, or a fun style, like an espadrille for a beach wedding, to tie your wedding together. Patterned shoes are also a fun way to jazz up an outfit in a way that is unique but not strange. Since shoes are relatively small accessories, even if their pattern is bold, the overall effect is still wearable., If standard pearls feel overdone, why not give your bridesmaids a piece of statement jewelry to wear on the big day? Whether the item is a chunky necklace in a contrasting color or earrings with a funny slogan, use accessories as a way to personalize your wedding.Turquoise could provide a welcome and pretty contrast to a red or coral colored outfit.
Layering multiple necklaces could add some eclectic interest to a hippie wedding.

, Layering clothes tends to add visual interest to an outfit, and bridesmaid apparel is no exception. To add some depth to the look, incorporate a patterned or colorful scarf to differentiate your bridesmaids from the rest of the pack. Your bridesmaids can use it to keep warm during a chilly ceremony or simply wear with another outfit after the big day.


If you’re getting married in the winter, luxurious fur or faux-fur stoles can impart an opulent, nontraditional look.

, For a bride who is really looking for something different, a hat, whether a fascinator, cowboy hat or top hat, can really drive home a theme and add some unexpected fun to your outfit. Choose something that complements the style of your bridesmaid clothes rather than contrasts with them, since hats are unusual at weddings already.


Fedoras could add an authentic edge to a ‘40s gangster wedding.
Straw hats could provide some shade and fun to a mid-summer affair in the tropics.

Craft a cascade bouquet.",How to Make Bridal Bouquets," White or cream flowers are traditional, but it's best to choose colors that complement the bridal dress. An elaborate gown should be the centerpiece, so restrain the bouquet to a single color or a small range of colors. A dress with a simple cut appreciates a more elaborate bouquet, with a variety of color and ornamentation.








For a more subtle bouquet, choose colors similar to your wedding gown's. Avoid identical shades and consider including accent colors. Too much similarity can make the scene flat and hard to photograph.
A bouquet of similar colors and shades is the easiest to put together. A classic bouquet uses white, cream, peach, and light pink flowers.
Complementary colors make a pleasing bouquet. Try yellow and violet, blue and orange, or red and green. If you don't want a bold bouquet, use soft tones and light shades.;
, These flowers need long, strong stems to support the bouquet without breaking. If possible, choose flowers that will be in-season during your wedding. Out-of-season flowers are much more expensive, may require advance ordering, and are difficult to replace in an emergency. Choose one to three of your favorite flowers that fit the bill, or browse through these options:









Single roses (not spray roses)
Peonies (ask a florist to recommend a variety, as many double-flower peonies have weak stems)
Hydrangeas
Magnolia
Double dahlias (single dahlias tend to drop petals)
Lisianthus
Cymbidium orchids
Calla lilies (or colorful mini callas)
Stargazer lilies

, A single-variety bouquet can look wonderful, and puts less stress on the novice flower arranger. But to engage your artistic side, pick any number of smaller flowers to add variety. You can use practically any flowers for these. If you're not sure what to pick, browse florist shops or online bouquet arrangements.









Popular secondary flowers include small single roses, spray roses, and freesia.
""Filler flowers"" are sprays of tiny flowers, buds, or berries. Try waxflower, baby's breath, or seeded eucalyptus.

, The bouquet size should match your own size and the grandeur of the venue. Large bouquets suit large church weddings and beaches, while smaller ones fit well into intimate spaces. As a good rule of thumb, the bouquet should be no wider than the bride's waist. Keep comfort in mind as well: large bouquets can be tiring to hold.


Most bridal bouquet diameters range from 8 inch (20cm) to 13 inches (33cm).
Get more flowers than you need. The number of flowers depends on the variety. Fifteen to thirty flowers is typical, but order spares as well. You may change your mind or come up with a new idea as you are building the bouquet.

, Lower the stems into a bucket or sink full of water. Trim off the ends at a 45º angle, about 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) from the end. This allows them to pull up water without air bubbles forming in the stem.Keep the flowers in a container of cool water until you are ready to build the bouquet.









Leave the stems long so they are easier to work with. You can trim them again once the bouquet is finished.

, Typically, you should use 12 dozen roses.

, Remove these with a stem stripper or floral shears, or pluck by hand if the stem has no thorns.









Discard damaged or discolored flowers.

, Choose four of the largest blossoms from your primary flowers. Position the blossoms in an even layer, crossing the stems.









Hold the bouquet just beneath the blossoms, where the stems cross. If you grip lower, the bent stems may cause the flowers to snap off.

, Place these one at a time, building evenly outward from your center. Keep the flowers as tight together as possible, crossing the stems so the flowers face slightly outward in a dome shape.









As you cross the stems, rotate your hand making a spiral shape with the stems.
A small bouquet may only use one ring of primary flowers around the center, especially if the blooms are large and fluffy.

, If you are using secondary flowers, place them wherever you see a gap between flowers. Place them around the edge of the dome as well, building it outward. Space these out so no two secondary flowers of the same type are touching each other. When finished, you should have a tight dome, with the largest flowers in the exact center.









Alternatively, build a Biedermeier bouquet. These have concentric circles of flowers with bold color differences.

, Slice the stems to the same length using clean stem cutters or gardening shears. Leave them a little long for now (at least 10"" or 25.4cm) as we will be trimming them again as a final step.







, Play with the bundle in your hand, adjusting any heights and making sure the bouquet looks balanced and rounded. If you see any uneven patches, fill them in with additional flowers.









If you have bouquet jewelry, push these down in between flowers throughout the bouquet. It only takes three or four pins to have a noticeable effect, but feel free to use more.
You may insert filler flowers throughout your bouquet. To make a spray at the edge, insert them between the outermost flowers only.

, Secure the bouquet about 1 inch (2.5cm) beneath the blossoms, or as close as necessary to keep the flowers tight together. Wrap the floral tape several times around the stems, then spiral it down another 3–4 inches (7.5–10cm).








You can use large, strong rubber bands instead, unless using delicate-stemmed flowers such as tulips and hyacinths.Place the band around two stems at one side of the bundle and twist to secure. Wrap the closed rubber band around the whole bundle several times, without inserting any stems inside it. Once tight, open the rubber band again and insert two stems on the opposite side. Place one band near the top of the stems, and a second one about 4 inches (10cm) beneath it.

, Choose a ribbon that matches your bridal gown or the colors of the bouquet. Cut a piece about three times the length of the stems.









For the spiral approach, weave the ribbon down the whole length of the stem, tucking it into the floral tape at the top and bottom. Secure with pins pushed into the flower stems.For the bow approach, cut a piece of ribbon and tie a bow around the bouquet. Be sure to cut off any visible floral tape, natural raffia palm, or rubber band that was used to secure the bouquet.
For an added touch of glamour, use pearl tipped straight pins.

, This type of bouquet is meant to be held in front of the bride, so the stems should be fairly short to avoid scraping the dress. 6–7 inches (15–17.5cm) is generally a good length. Pat the ends dry with a paper towel before handing to the bride.








, Keep the bouquet in a cool place until the wedding, in a container of water. A florist can sell you a flower preservative that will prolong the flowers' life. Transport the bouquet in water whenever possible.









If you do not have a cool room, keep the flowers in a fridge set above 35ºF (1.7ºC). Remove all fruit from the fridge; most fruit produce gases which speed up flower aging.A light spray of hairspray may preserve your bouquet as well. Hang the bouquet upside down for a few minutes so the hairspray dries on the blooms, before returning it to the vase., A traditional combination is white Roses, Lilies, and a splash of green foliage (Gunny Eucalyptus, Ferns, Camellia, Foxtail, Yarrow)









Remember to consider any allergies to specific flowers/plants when selecting the combination.

,


You will need strippers, scissors, raffia palm or rubber bands, clippers, and white ribbon.

, Using strippers, remove most foliage and any thorns from the flower’s stems. Consider removing any guard petals (the outer petals) or additional tattered or wilted material from the stem.









If you'd like green in your bouquet, keep the top leaves of each flower.
Remove stamens from lilies, as they turn brown and can stain the Bride’s dress.
Trim the foliage so everything below your grip on the stem in clean.

, If you are right-handed, you will build the bouquet in your left hand and place the flowers and foliage piece by piece with your right hand. The placement of the flowers depend on the natural bend of the flower.








, Adding the stem to the open area by your wrist, crossing the stems to make a spiral shape.








, Make sure the flowers are not at an awkward angle or extending too far from the center. Add filler to the perimeter to unify the bundle and serve as a border.








, This will make the bouquet easier to work with.








, Wrap the bundle with natural raffia palm or a rubber band as a temporary fastener.








, Use between 4 and 6 yards of ribbon depending on the width of the bouquet. Tie the end of the ribbon in a knot or a bow.








, Cut the stems evenly about an inch below the ribbon.








, These bouquets have long stems topped with a long strip of flowers. The bride cradles the stems, resting the bouquet against one arm.These are simple to make, but may tire you out in a long ceremony.

, Besides the decorative appearance, a bouquet holder helps by hydrating your flowers. Soak the ""wick"" of the bouquet holder before you place your flowers inside, and the stems will drink throughout your wedding.


The term ""nosegay"" refers to a small, round bouquet inside a bouquet holder or a decorative ""tussy mussy."" It can also refer to a small, looser bouquet that includes greenery or herbs.

, This is probably the most difficult bouquet to make, as it can easily become lopsided or overwhelm the rest of the decor. Start with a special bouquet holder with a slanted opening. Arrange the flowers so they spill out of the holder. Longer sprays trail out the front, and larger blossoms fill the mouth of the holder.

, Cut about two inches from the bottom and place the stems in the bucket to hydrate.


Fill another bucket in like manner and place the greens to hydrate as well.

, Using roses that are ruffling open will create a softer working surface and provide you with that soft petal on petal look that is desired.

, If you are left handed, your hands and direction will be the exact opposite. This forms the bouquet's ‘center stage’.

, Place the second rose crossing to the left, lying it down almost totally sideways and pulling it in so that it rests right underneath the center stage.

, Form the first circle of seats around the bouquet's ‘center stage’. You will be repeating the cross to the left, turn to the right motion until the first row of roses is placed.

, If done correctly, you should have a nice dome shape across the top of your bouquet.


If your bouquet looks like a flat pancake across the top, you are not tucking the rows of roses tightly enough under the last row.

, This creates a ‘collar’ of soft greens under the outer edge of the bouquet.


When placing the greens, make sure only a small amount of the leaves are peaking out past the last row of roses. Making the greens too ‘bushy’ will take away from the finished look of your bouquet.

,, Turn the bouquet sideways so that you can see the bottom edge of the bouquet and the stem lengths.

Remember the plus one.,
Divide your guests into groups.,
Establish rules with your family.,
Write two lists.,
Edit it down.,
Establish a date when the backup guests will be invited.,
Consider inviting people to the reception only.",How to Create a Wedding Guest List," Even if you’re not sure on the specific figure, you can determine roughly what size of wedding you want. This will help you get quotes from caterers and venues while allowing you to figure out the specific number later.


Some people decide just to invite immediate family members and a few close friends.
A small wedding is generally around 50-75 people.The average wedding is around 150 people.A large wedding is 200 people or more.;
, The easiest way to decide how many people to invite is to look at how many people you can afford to invite. The more people you invite, the more expensive the reception and ceremony will be.


If your parents are chipping in, find out how much each couple is contributing. Factor that into how much you and your partner can afford to spend.Get a few quotes from local caterers to see how much the reception may cost per person. Remember to factor in drinks and cake as well. Catering should take up about 25% of your budget., The number of people you can invite may be decided by where you have your wedding. If you have your heart set on a particular venue, ask them how many people they can hold. Do not invite more than this number, or else you may find yourself scrambling to fit everyone., Both you and your partner will want to invite important family and friends. Furthermore, both sets of parents may have ideas about who should come. A good way to fairly decide is to divide up the guest list amongst you, your partner, and both sets of parents. Some ways you can decide:Divide the list in thirds. One third for your guests, one third for your partner’s guests, and one third for mutual friends.Divide the list in fourths: one fourth for your guests, one fourth for your partner’s guests, one fourth for your parents’ guests, and one fourth for your partner’s parents guests.
One half of the guest list is for you and your partner’s friends. Each set of parents receives one-fourth of the guest list.
While traditionally it is advised that both sides of the family invite the same number of guests, you should divide the guest list based on your circumstances and preferences., Some people prefer not to invite children because they worry kids will be loud or disrupt the ceremony. Others feel that a wedding is a family event and that children are part of the family.Another option is to have children only attend the reception. Understand that some guests may choose not to come if their children are not invited.


You may also want to set an age limit to decide whether you are inviting teenagers or not. This could be as young as 12 or as old as 18., You will have to decide who is allowed to bring a guest. If you do not have room for all of your friends to bring an extra person, you may want to skip the option to bring a date on the invitation. That said, if you have a friend who is in a long term relationship or married, then you should invite their partner as well. Factor these into the guest list count., Different groups of people in your life may have varying significance to you. When planning, create four different groups of people you are considering. Number these groups by their priority. For example, it may be more important to you to invite close friends than extended family members. Typically, these four groups are: Immediate family members
Extended family members
Close friends
Work mates or colleagues

, Your parents and your partner’s parents may have their own ideas about who to invite. Let them know upfront what kind of wedding you want. Tell them how many people they can invite. Be firm about your boundaries. Make sure that each party understands that they need to follow these rules. Some rules you may consider:


Only invite people you’ve talked to in the last year.
Friends of the couple have priority over friends of the parents.
Certain estranged family members may not be invited.

, The first list is the people you absolutely want to invite. This could be family members, close friends, or other special people. The second is your back-up list. This is the list of people you would like to invite but don’t have space or the budget for. If a person from the first list declines, invite a person from the back-up list.Assume that approximately 20 percent of your invited guests will not be able to attend. Make sure that you have at least this number on your back-up list. This will help you maximize the number of guests who can come to your wedding.

, Before you send the invitations out, make sure that you are not inviting any more people than your absolute maximum. When you cut guests, go from the lowest priority guests (colleagues, distant family members, family friends you might not know) up to the highest., You don't want to send out last minute invites. Make sure that you send out your first round of invitations early enough so that you can send out a second round later. A good guideline is to send your first invitations three months before the wedding and the second set six to eight weeks before the wedding.This second round of invites should have its own RSVP date.

, If you are getting married in a small venue, you may find yourself struggling to fit all of your dear friends onto the list. You may consider having a separate guest list for the reception. Explain to your friends that you would love to have them at the wedding but that you are limited with space.A good way to explain it is: “Our venue is so small that we cannot invite everyone we want to the wedding, but we would still love it if you could celebrate with us. You are welcome to join us at the reception.”
If you have a destination wedding, you may choose to have a reception in your hometown. You can invite all of the friends that could not attend the wedding to this celebration.

Use a website to help keep track of your registry.,
Choose the website that's best for you.,
Decide what to request with your partner.,
Include more gift requests than invited guests.,
Register at multiple retailers.",How to Create a Wedding Registry1," There are a websites that are designed to help you compile the specific items you want to include in your registry, as well as the retailers or other organizations you can register with. Some websites, like Newly Wish, are designed specifically for engaged couples and can help you select items to include in your registry.Other examples of registry-hosting websites include Blueprint, Simple Registry, CheckedTwice, My Registry, Zola, All My Gifts, and Knack.
While most of these websites are free, some charge a small fee.
Keep in mind that the website you use to host your registry is separate from your wedding website.;
, Different registry websites will have different criteria regarding what can be added to your registry and how to do so. For instance, some websites will allow you to add gifts from all over the web, while some may limit you to the retailers that are affiliated with the registry website.One specific feature that's offered by many of these websites is the ability to scan an item’s barcode at a store and have it added to your registry. If this is something that you want, make sure the register websites you are considering offer this feature.

, The most time-consuming (but also potentially the most fun) part of creating a registry is deciding what specific items to put in your registry. If you and your partner are unsure of what to ask for, make a list of items you don’t have or would like to upgrade for ideas. These discussions can also help determine the types of retailers you should register with.Most people use wedding registries to outfit their new homes and/or lives together. If neither of you have a full set of dishware, this could be a great thing to request.
Other categories to talk about include outdoor gear, board games, sheet sets, furniture, storage equipment, tools, and barware.

, People prefer to have lots of variety to choose from, even within a certain category of gifts. As such, shoot for more requests than the number of gifts you anticipate receiving. For instance, if you invite 100 guests, shoot for 125 potential gifts in your registry.Keep in mind that families and couples will likely bring one gift, as opposed to a gift per person.

, Depending on the registry website you choose, you may still want to register with retailers directly. Whereas some registry websites are affiliated with retailers, others are simply lists of gift requests. In the case of the latter, registering with retailers directly can help prevent guests from unknowingly purchasing the same gift. Whatever organizing method you use, try to incorporate gift requests from two to four different retailers.Include at least one national retailer that carries a wide variety of items, such as Target, REI, or Bed Bath & Beyond.
Try to include a local or specialty store that you enjoy to shop at.
Be sure that the majority of the items in your registry can be ordered online, as this will be easier for both you and your guests. That said, some guests will still prefer to purchase gifts from a store and bring them to the wedding.

Do a honeymoon registry instead.,
Ask guests to donate to a non-profit.,
Have a bridal registry instead.",How to Create a Wedding Registry2," It is increasingly popular to have a registry for contributions to your honeymoon, as opposed to tangible gifts. Use a website such as Honeyfund to describe the honeymoon you’re planning, and offer guests the opportunity to pitch in towards your flight, accommodations, or another aspect of your trip., Another alternative to a traditional gift registry is inviting guests to donate in your name to a non-profit of your choosing. This can be done with little effort; contact a beneficiary organization directly and ask them how you can direct guests to donate.


This may be as simple as including a link to the beneficiary's donation page on your wedding website.
If you do go with a traditional gift registry, some registry hosting websites, such as The Knot, will donate to a charity of your choosing for each gift purchased through their website.

, The terms “bridal registry” and “wedding registry” are often used interchangeably, though some couples choose to have a registry for both the bridal shower and the wedding. Another option is to fore-go a traditional wedding registry altogether and having a bridal registry instead, perhaps only for attendees to your bridal shower.This can be a fun way to get smaller or more intimate gifts from your close friends. You can also still request specific items, such as guidebooks for your honeymoon, lingerie, or gift certificates for a pedicure before your wedding.

Share your registry information on your wedding website.,
Request gifts at multiple price points.,
Store presents that arrive before the wedding.,
Write your thank you notes by hand.",How to Create a Wedding Registry3," Avoid including information about your registry on your wedding stationery, such as your save-the-date or wedding invitations. On these items, simply include the link to your wedding website, where your registry information and other details can be featured.On your wedding website, include all of the necessary information someone might need to find a gift you’ve requested, including the specific retailers you’re registered with, as well as your registry website if you're using one.

, One of the most important aspects of your registry in terms of tactfulness is including gifts of multiple price points. As a rule of thumb, keep about a third of your gifts below $50, a third between $50 and $150, and the final third over $150.Adjust these numbers as you see fit, keeping in mind that variety is key.
If you find yourself wondering whether your price points are potentially too high, you can assume that your guests will feel similarly.

, If you receive wedding presents in the mail before your big day, hold off on opening them. This is important for several reasons. In particular, you may receive three sets of towels, despite setting up a registry to help prevent this sort of mishap.After the wedding, you’ll be able to best determine what isn’t needed, and which items will be easiest to return or exchange.

, While e-mails or phone calls will be tempting once you see the list of people you need to thank, spend the time handwriting your thank you notes. Thank you notes should be sent to everyone who gives any type of gift, whether it is something tangible or a donation in your name, etc.Another perk offered by many registry websites is a list of who got you what, so you don’t have to compile one yourself. Use this list to help keep track of all the thank you notes you need to send.

Ask why they refuse to come.,
Be honest and open about your feelings.,
Explain why you want to get married.,
Counter their arguments.,
Avoid blaming yourself.,
Talk with a therapist or counselor.",How to Cope when Loved Ones Refuse to Come to Your Wedding1," Chances are, you may have some idea why loved ones might refuse your wedding invitation. Regardless of whether you know the reason or it comes as a complete surprise, call or sit down with the loved ones. Ask them directly why they don't want to come to your wedding.


Talking with the loved ones directly will prevent future misunderstandings, so it's important to hear what they have to say. For example, you could say, ""I know you don't get along with my fiancee, but is that what's stopping you from attending our wedding?""
Knowing the reason may also allow you to make compromises. For instance, maybe the person doesn't want to go because they don't want to see an ex-spouse. Offer to let them choose their own seat at the reception, or ask if they would be comfortable attending the ceremony and skipping the reception, etc.;
, Once the loved ones have explained why they don't want to come, sincerely tell them how their decision has made you feel. They may not have realized how hurt you would be by their absence and may even reconsider coming to the wedding. If not, they may acknowledge your feelings.


For example, you might tell them, ""I've always respected you and your opinion. Your refusal to come to my wedding makes me feel angry and unloved.""

, The loved ones may have made their decision without knowing much about why you're getting married. Take the time to explain how much you love your fiancee, that you understand marriage is a serious commitment, and what your plans are for the wedding ceremony. If it's important for you to have them there, make it clear that you value their presence.For example, you might say, ""My fiancee and I have been together a long time and we'd like to officially pledge our love for each other in front of our closest friends and family. We'd really like you to be there to support us.""

, Once you've listened to their justifications for refusing to attend, respectfully respond to their concerns. Pay attention to how you react and try to think through your response before talking. Remain calm and avoid blaming them, which will only strengthen their resolve.For example, if they refuse to come because there are religious differences, you might say, ""I know the fact that my fiancee is of a different faith concerns you; however, we've discussed the effect our spirituality has on our relationship. We'd still love for you to attend.""

, It's easy to beat yourself up when loved ones refuse to come to your wedding. You might even start asking yourself what you could have done differently to prevent the falling out. You need to realize that they've made their decision. Their absence at your wedding won't define who you are.Remind yourself that you did your part by extending the invitation. This shows that you've made an effort for them to be a part of your life. It's up to them to refuse or accept it.

, If you're still hurt, angry, or resentful at the loved ones who refuse to attend your wedding and you want them to be there, ask them if they'd consider going to therapy with you. You may not convince them to come to your wedding, but maybe talking with a third-party would help you all understand each others' feelings better.If the loved ones refuse to attend therapy, consider going by yourself. Talking through your emotions can help you process your feelings so you can move on and enjoy your day.

Make a list of all possible options.,
Consider immediate family.,
Don’t forget about your partner’s family.,
Choose approximately one bridesmaid and groomsman for every 50 guests.,
Give your wedding party a heads up before they’re invited.,
Give expectations for your wedding party’s responsibilities.,
Choose drama-free, supportive people who want to be in the wedding.",How to Choose Your Wedding Party1," Sit down with your partner and make a list of all people possible to be in your wedding party. Include whom you want, whom your partner wants, whom you feel obligated to invite, and whom you want to invite. Think about options from family to high school friends to newer friends you’ve made in the professional world.;
, Your siblings will be your siblings forever. Even if you might be closer with your best work buddy than your brother right now, your brother will always be your brother. Weddings are mainly about family; you should seriously consider choosing your siblings for your wedding party. Leaving your siblings out could cause some unpleasant and unnecessary family drama, too., Even if you’re the one doing most of the wedding planning, remember that your partner’s family probably has just as much drama as yours. Your partner has just as many obligations to siblings and friends as you do. If your fiance asks you to invite his younger sister to be a bridesmaid, do it. The wedding party is a mixture of people that is supposed to love and support both of you., This is not a hard and fast rule, but it is a general guideline given to most people planning weddings. It might seem uneven to have a 300 person wedding with 1 bridesmaid or a 75 person wedding with 10 groomsmen. Use this rule as a guideline to narrowing down your list of potential wedding partiers.However, don’t feel limited to sticking to the traditional gender balance (having an equal number of bridesmaids and groomsman). You can have more of one than the other, and you can also put them on different sides of the altar.
Don’t forget about the size of your altar! If you’re getting married somewhere with limited space, make sure that you can fit your wedding party there comfortably.

, Before you send out official invitations or post on social media about your wedding, ask your potential wedding partiers if they want to be in the wedding. They might have other commitments, have a fear of standing up in public, or just don’t want to be in your wedding. This is okay. Give them a chance to say “no” and don’t ask them to give you an answer as soon as you ask. Let them think about it. Being in a wedding party can be a decision that is financially challenging and demands a lot of time., Do you need your bridesmaids there every second of the way to reassure and help you, or are you the kind of person who needs his groomsmen there just for the day of the wedding? No matter what, your wedding party should know their responsibilities for before, during, and after the wedding. Being in a wedding party is a commitment, and your members should know all of their responsibilities before they agree to be in the wedding.


Think about where your wedding party lives and what’s going on in their lives. Your friend from across the country might not be able to help you assemble flower arrangements, but maybe she can make one weekend trip to go dress shopping with you., In your wedding party, you want to include people who are positive, supportive, and loving of both you and your partner. You should not choose anyone you suspect will be dramatic or demanding--this is your day.Your entire wedding party should also be filled with people who are excited about your marriage; it might not be the place for your cousin who thinks your fiance is annoying or your friend who is visibly jealous and resentful of you."

Decide on when you want music to be played on your wedding day.,
Define your wedding day.,
Choose your songs.,
Short list your musicians.,
Contact your shortlisted musicians.,
Make your final choice.,
Keep in contact.",How to Choose Your Wedding Musicians," Here are some suggestions:


Before the ceremony - as guest assemble in the ceremony venue.
The ceremony – as the Bride enters the ceremony venue, the lighting of unity candles, signing the register and as the newlyweds exit the venue.
The cocktail reception – as guests clamour to congratulate the newlyweds, as the photographer get underway and as the happy couple and their guests begin to relax into the celebrations of the day.
During dinner – ambient background music is the perfect choice.
Following the speeches and formalities – music at this point signals the end of ceremony and the beginning of evening celebration.
At the evening reception – as the day/evening progresses it is traditional to switch from ambient music to party entertainment either through live music or more commonly a DJ.;
, Are you having a religious ceremony, perhaps a church wedding? Some wedding venues, especially churches, are particular about what music they will allow at their venue, so check first with your celebrant. Is yours a modern wedding with a less formal and/or non-religious focus perhaps in a hotel, abroad, on a beach or registry office? Many modern wedding have a balance of both, a religious ceremony followed by an informal, relaxed celebration. Ok, now you’ve decided when you want music to be played and what types of music might be appropriate, let’s move on:

, Choosing your wedding day music can seem a daunting task. How do you express your emotions without ""over doing"" it? How do you respect the musical preferences of 2 or 3 different generations? Opting for acoustic music can often help to bridge the gap between intimate ambiance and modern music. The popularity of acoustic music has increased dramatically in recent years with artists across the globe and from all genres finding beauty in abridged expression and produced their intimate offerings. Acoustic music has the power to simplify even the most complex music and deliver a fresh, modern and understated version of your favourite songs. Acoustic musicians are highly talented, they have to be, after all there’s no big backing sound for them to hide behind! Acoustic wedding music brings a relaxed and unique ambiance to your wedding day without overpowering it; remember it is YOUR day, not the musicians showcase! For more help on choosing your songs, see the article called “Choosing your wedding day songs” on wikiHow

, Choosing the right style: Acoustic music is extremely popular for weddings because it is unimposing and subtle, can be adapted and is flexible. Other popular styles include Classical or Jazz music played on a piano/keyboard or by string musicians. More traditional ceremonies might opt for a solo soprano or tenor singer. When short listing musicians you should have a clear idea of the styles of music they offer and a detailed set list, sometimes called a repertoire. TIP: a larger repertoire usually indicates a more experienced artist(s). It is not unusual for very experienced musicians to have more than 300 songs available and these should cross a diverse range of musical styles.


Opt for a professional: Professional musicians should have a detailed website; they’re professional business people! A professional’s website should include the following information: images of them playing live, audio samples of their music and maybe even video samples of their live performance. A detailed set list so that you can see what music they currently play. A simple method of contact.
Where and when they work – professional musicians are full-time and will often travel far and wide to get to your wedding!
Check out their level of experience – how many wedding have they performed at? Weddings are unique and often a musician has to quickly move from one venue to another – wedding celebrations take a great deal of planning and organisation for the musician – experience matters!
Searching for musicians: The web is the best place to search for professional musicians. Use a reputable search engine to help you. Say, for example, you have decided that you want acoustic wedding music and you’re getting married in the Algarve – search wedding music Algarve or maybe acoustic wedding music.
View websites, not forgetting to use the pointers above to help you assess whether you’re dealing with a professional musician or not. * Once you’ve found musicians’ websites use this checklist: How many songs and song styles match well to your song choices? Will the musician(s) learn a song especially for you? AVOID ones that won’t. How long do they play for? Weddings are unique and musicians often played extended sets – let’s look at this point in more detail: Say, for example, you want music at your ceremony, at the cocktail reception and through or after dinner, it is very unlikely that the traditional sets of 2 x 45 minutes will suffice. AVOID musicians who stipulate that they play 2 x 45 minute sets! In the example above you would need up to an hour at the ceremony, 60-90 minutes at the cocktail reception and 60-90 minutes during or after dinner – that’s up to 4 hours for the musician; which is why the experienced musician has such a large repertoire! Tips for assessing audio and video examples of a musicians work: AUDIO: do audio samples fairly represent the music that can be delivered? For example: say you’re viewing the website of an acoustic duo – does their music sample have instrument sounds that wouldn’t be appropriate on your day – a drum machine in church! VIDEO: Does the website show video samples of the act playing live?

TIP: avoid musicians who position themselves in the front line of your wedding ceremony. This is YOUR wedding day and you should be the primary focus – not your wedding musicians! YOUR day should not be a talent showcase for the musician – ceremony musicians should always be situated at the back of your ceremony venue and not be seen using the alter as a stage area!



, Contact information should be readily available on a musician’s website. Give as much detail as you can to ensure you get the most appropriate advice. Minimum information should include the following: Date of wedding Wedding venue with full address Time of wedding (musicians need to be at your venue at least 1 hour before you arrive to set up and sound check) When you want the musician to play and for how long. If you have a special request – make sure that they will be able to perform it. How many guests.




TIP: not all musicians have suitable equipment for large venues! Don’t be afraid to ask the musician what equipment he has and check the suitability for your venue or wedding party size. Are references available from previous clients?



, Make sure you are happy with your selection. Some people prefer to talk in person with a musician – it helps to build understanding and confidence. Prices vary – expect to pay a good duo around £250-£300 for a ceremony only. £450-£550 for a ceremony & cocktail reception and £700 – 900 ceremony, cocktail and either dinner or after dinner music.

, Ask for a full set list. Select your songs. Discuss any special requirements. TIP: Leading wedding musicians have played at lots of weddings. Their experience is valuable and readily available. Ask for help and advice when choosing your music.

Be there for each other.,
Surround yourself with guests that support you.,
Thank the people who will come to your wedding.,
Deal with the pain of rejection.,
Do something for you.",How to Cope when Loved Ones Refuse to Come to Your Wedding2," Remind yourself that your wedding is about the commitment between you and your fiancee. Instead of feeling stressed out about your loved ones' refusal to come to your wedding, focus on the fact that you and your spouse will soon be starting a new life together.


Share your feelings with your fiancee and let your fiancee help you work through them. For example, you might say, ""I'm really upset that our loved ones won't come to the wedding."" Talking through your emotions together will make you feel closer.

, Keep in mind that your wedding should be filled with people who love and care for you and your fiancee. If you think a loved one's absence will be notable, ask a close friend or relative to step in and fill the role. For example, if your father refuses to come to your wedding, you could ask a close friend to walk you down the aisle.Remind yourself that you may have a better time at the wedding than if people who didn't support you came to the wedding and made you uncomfortable., Some guests may feel uncomfortable if others refuse to come to your wedding. Take the time to talk with guests who have accepted the invitation to thank them for coming, especially if they may feel out of place. This will put them at ease.


For example, you might say, ""I know you and my mom don't really get along, but it means a lot to me that you're coming to my wedding.""

, Having loved ones who refuse to come to your wedding may be very painful and feel like a rejection. Allow yourself to feel that pain and grieve a little, then take steps to rebuild your bruised self-esteem and more forward. Catch any negative talk — things like ""What is wrong with me?"", ""Why don't they love me?"", etc. — and remind yourself that everyone experiences rejection, even the most confident and successful people. The way to recover is to think of the rejection as something outside of yourself; that it has absolutely nothing to do with your worth as a person. This is your loved ones' problem.If your self-confidence is hurt, try taking a moment every day to write down three things you like about yourself. On top of that, you might write a few things that you are looking forward to at your wedding, such as cutting the cake with your new spouse.
Try setting a limit on how long you can grieve. Tell yourself: ""I can mourn the fact that my dad won't be at my wedding and walking me down the aisle until Friday at 4pm. Then I will let go of it.""

, If you find yourself dwelling on how unhappy you are or you can't seem to shake feeling sorry for yourself, change your focus. Remind yourself that you should feel happy during this engagement period. Take time out of your planning schedule to do something that cheers you up.For example, you might want to do something by yourself like go for a hike, shop, or see a movie. Or you could call a close friend and do something fun together.

Have an honest talk with your partner.,
Work through the refusal.,
Surround your fiancee with supportive people.",How to Cope when Loved Ones Refuse to Come to Your Wedding3," If your fiancee was really depending on their loved ones attending, you need to be there emotionally for your partner. Remind your partner that your wedding is about the two of you. If you're concerned that your partner won't want to get married because the loved ones won't be there, ask your fiancee if they want to change wedding plans. Listen to what they say and don't dismiss their feelings.For example, you might say, ""I know you were planning on your loved ones being there for us, but remember that it's our wedding and I'll always be there for you.""

, Your fiancee might be struggling to understand why the loved ones refused the invitation or their decision not to come to your wedding. Give your fiancee time to work through their own emotions. Remind your fiancee that you still have things you can do to plan the wedding and refocus the attention onto the rest of the wedding.If you can, avoid creating a dramatic or hurtful situation. Instead, gently remind your fiancee that it's alright to feel hurt, but they should avoid angry confrontations.

, Ensure that other loved ones of your fiancee are still able to come to the wedding. These people can lift your fiancee's spirits and remind your fiancee that people care about your love and commitment. If some people are undecided about coming, consider calling them yourself to personally ask them to attend.


For example, you might call one of your fiancee's close friends who lives far away and briefly explain the situation. Let the friend know that it would mean a lot to your fiancee for them to be at the wedding.

Consider your close friends and family members.,
Choose responsible people to be your maid of honor and best man.,
Outline the responsibilities for your maid of honor and best man.",How to Choose Your Wedding Party2," When you love all of the people in your wedding party, it can be hard to choose just one maid of honor and best man. Of all of these people, your maid of honor and best man should be the people to whom you and your partner feel the closest.


However, no one can blame you for choosing a family member. If you can’t choose between two of your best friends, you can pick your sister to diffuse potential tension.
Even if you were one of your bridesmaids’ maid of honor, do not feel like you need to choose her to be your maid of honor. It’s your wedding, and ultimately the choice is yours., The maid of honor and best man are typically responsible for planning events like bridal showers and bachelor parties. They also have the responsibility of planning and organizing for you and making sure that you have everything you need on the day of the wedding. If you want your sister to be your maid of honor but she’s really busy or disorganized, you could ask someone else in the bridal party to plan your bridal shower or your bachelorette party. The bridesmaid will probably be honored by the extra duty and will want to help in any way she can.

, Make sure that, before your maid of honor or best man agrees to the task, they know what they’re responsible for. Many people would be excited to plan your bachelorette party for you, but siblings in graduate school or friends across the country might not have the logistical time or ability to do these things for you.


Have a conversation with your potential maid of honor or best man where you outline the responsibilities for the position. Make sure that the person is enthusiastic about whatever the responsibilities are.

Consider having a small wedding party.,
Don’t feel limited by tradition.,
Think about budget.,
Think about the other roles.",How to Choose Your Wedding Party3," Think about potential conflicts and drama beforehand. Factor in your and your fiance’s family dynamics into the decision. Make no mistake that this decision is about you and your partner--if you want to have a small wedding party, have a small wedding party. Don’t feel obligated to invite everyone who expects to be invited or invite everyone your parents want you to invite. Keep in mind that this is your day. There is no right or wrong way to have a bridal party., If you’re a bride, your “maid of honor” can be a man, and vice versa. You can have two maids of honor. You can have a maid and a matron of honor. You can have no best man. There’s no wrong way to do your wedding, so you should go with whatever feels right for your particular situation and wedding.

, Budget is an important part of any wedding and wedding party. Will your bridesmaids pay for their own dresses? Are groomsmen responsible for renting their own tuxes? Will you be able to help out with any part of the finances? Who will pay for the bachelorette party? Think about these issues with your partner, and communicate them clearly to your wedding party. They should know exactly what they will have to pay for before they sign on to be members of the wedding party.

, Do you want ushers? People to hand out programs? A ring bearer? A flower girl? Someone to do a reading at the ceremony? All of these other roles must be decided and determined by you and your partner. Think twice before you give people jobs like being an usher or someone who hands out programs--it could be seen as a favor instead of an honor.Don’t feel like you need to have a ring bearer or a flower girl. Have these positions only if you know of any children who would like this job.

Think carefully about who to invite.,
Talk to family and close friends about any concerns they have.,
Ask guests about any dietary restrictions or other special needs.,
Figure out your top priorities.,
Decide how to divide the guest list early on.,
Be up-front about decisions you’re not willing to budge on.,
Avoid letting people bring uninvited guests.,
Provide clear directions.,
Have someone ready to play referee and handle conflict.,
Set up activities for the kids.,
Try not to take criticism personally.",How to Deal with Demanding Wedding Guests," Keep in mind that you’re not obligated to invite anybody to your wedding. This day is about you and your partner. If you have estranged relationships with certain family members or you have fallen out with an old friend, don't feel pressured to send an invite. Plus, if you know certain family members or friends are notorious for being a bit difficult, it might be best to leave them off the guest list.If a distant relative or acquaintance expresses disappointment at not being invited, say something like, “I would have loved to have everyone attend, but we’ve decided to have a smaller wedding because of budget constraints.”
To avoid making people feel left out, consider arranging an informal get-together or party after you return from the honeymoon.;
, If you know ahead of time that an aspect of your wedding will be a point of conflict with one of your guests, discuss it with them. Bringing up the issue will make them feel like you care about their concerns. You may be able to reach an understanding so that your wedding day proceeds without any unhappiness or hurt feelings.For instance, you might want to invite a close friend who happens to be your brother’s ex-girlfriend. Explain your choice by saying, ""I know you guys broke up Charlie, but she has been my friend for years. I would really like to have here there. I will make sure you are seated far apart from each other.""

, Guests who announce they can’t eat the food at the reception can cause extra expense and hassle for you and the caterer. Include a space on your RSVP card where guests can indicate any food allergies or other dietary restrictions, such as a vegan or religious diet.You can send an email or call guest individually and say, ""We are planning the menu for the reception dinner and wanted to inquire about any special diets. Do you have any dietary restrictions?""

, Undoubtedly, something will go wrong at your wedding, but you can decrease your frustration by paying extra special attention to certain aspects of the day. Thinking about what's most important to you and your partner and planning accordingly will ensure the day is memorable, even if there is a small hitch in the plan.


For instance, if you and your spouse really want guests to be able to have fun and dance all night, you might spend extra money on a DJ with a broad range of music choices. That way, if guests aren't pleased with your music choices, they can make special requests., Traditionally, the bride and groom get to choose half of the guests, and the remaining half is split evenly between their families. If you think that your family or your fiancée’s family might not like this arrangement, consider splitting the list three ways.Keep in mind that if one or both of your families are helping to pay for the wedding, they should get a bigger say in who gets to come.

, If you’re absolutely certain about your venue or the style of dress you want, don’t let anyone talk you out of it. You’ll remember this day forever, so stand your ground on details that are particularly important to you.Identify some areas you’re willing to compromise on and use them as bargaining chips. That way, when your mother tries to pick out flowers for you, you can say, “Mom, I really appreciate that you want to help with this, but I’m absolutely sure I want gardenias. Will you help me design my invitations instead?”

, Print names on the response cards included in your invitations, so that guests can’t write an extra name on them. If you do intend to let someone bring a date, make it clear by indicating it on the envelope.If someone tries to write in the name of an extra guest anyways, call them and politely let them know of the mistake. Say, “I’m sorry the invitation was confusing, but we don’t have space at the venue for everybody to bring a guest. I’m looking forward to seeing you, though.”
Be aware that if one of your guests is engaged or married, etiquette dictates that you must invite their fiancé or spouse, too., Some wedding guests who come off as demanding might just be confused. Make sure everybody knows how to get to the hotel, the wedding itself, and the reception venue. That way, no one will give you, your wedding planner, or the hotel staff a hard time when they’re feeling lost.Providing clear directions is especially important if you’re having a destination wedding or getting married somewhere foreign to most guests.
For example, you can provide clear directions and an itinerary on your wedding website. Provide links to hotels where guest can book a stay, offer easy-to-follow directions to the wedding and reception locations, and practical tips like what sort of attire to wear for the event.

, If a guest does start acting rude, demanding, or belligerent at your wedding, you shouldn’t be the one who has to deal with it. Enlist the help of your wedding planner or a friend to handle difficult guests.Decide on a code word ahead of time to let the designated referee know that a guest is becoming a problem.
For example, if your mother-in-law simply won't stop complaining, you might have a point-person in her family to distract her with a task or give her an alcoholic beverage to settle her down.

, If you’ve invited children to your wedding and reception, a little extra thought can ensure they stay happy all night. Doing so will minimize any problems with parents not knowing how to entertain their kids and actually be guests at the wedding. Allow both adults and children to enjoy themselves by providing kid-friendly things to do.


For instance, make sure there will be kid-friendly foods available, set boxes of crayons at their table, and provide small toys or bottles of bubble solution for them., Sometimes people forget their manners when they’re inebriated. There will always be someone who isn’t satisfied with the music, food, or venue, and thinks it’s a good idea to tell you about it. Shrug it off and redirect the conversation if you can – it’s your wedding, not theirs, and a little misguided criticism doesn’t have to ruin the night.For instance, if your great-aunt Harriet goes on and on about how the ceremony was not performed according to tradition, perform a self-assessment and ask yourself ""Am I happy with the way things went?"" If you are, ignore her criticism and enjoy your special day.

Consider a veil with an unconventional design and soft, lacy fabric.
Depending on your dress and personal style, you can even opt for an ultra-relaxed, no-jewelry look.

, High heels typically do not compliment a boho style bridal gown – a laid-back dress calls for carefree footwear. Many boho weddings are held at outdoor venues, with a ground covering of soft grass or sand, so going barefoot works well in these situations. You can have your bridal party go barefoot, as well, to complete the intimate atmosphere and lighthearted look.If you prefer to wear shoes, stick to simple designs. Flats and delicate sandals work well, but the ultimate decision should be made based on the design of your dress.

You could do something even simpler, such as tucking sprigs of baby’s breath or wild flowers into a loose and somewhat “undone” hair style.Try adorning braids and up-dos with fresh herbs and daisies.More intricate fabric headpieces with floral details are also popular.

Look for settings that feature a lot of lush greenery that you can easily incorporate into your wedding theme.

, Use as many organic details as possible. Decorate with floral wreaths, garlands, potted plants and lush greenery. Select accents made of natural materials like burlap and wood.

Roses are a typical choice for weddings, but try mixing them with simpler flowers like baby’s breath, lavender sprigs, daisies and honeysuckle. Keep floral accents loose and “undone.” Avoid rigid wreaths and arrangements.Instead of typical-looking “perfect” floral arrangements, look for organically shaped bouquets and more natural combinations.
Suspend fresh flower bundles from the ceiling or hang them on the walls.
Shop for locally grown flowers and herbs, or head out into a nearby field and collect flowers and wild grasses yourself.

, Fresh flowers are a must, but dried flower arrangements and bouquets can make a unique bohemian statement. If the budget is an issue, dried flowers can be a beautiful way to save some money. You also don’t have to worry about dried flowers wilting or being damaged. Find a supplier and create dried flower bundles yourself. Tie them together with natural fibers like twine and burlap.

Offer at least three different options.,
Go with what’s in season.,
Pick a theme to guide you.,
Consider special needs, but don’t stress out about it too much.,
Maximize your vegetarian or vegan option.,
Ask and inform guests about possible allergens.,
Hire a specialized caterer if necessary.,
Decide whether or not you’ll serve a meal.,
Expect age to affect appetite.,
Factor in the time of day.,
Provide back-up if necessary.",How to Choose Wedding Reception Canapes," If you want to, feel free to offer more than that, as long as you can afford to. But expect costs to rise significantly with each additional item that you add to your menu. If budget is a concern, stick to just three types of canapes in order to offer your guests some variety without spending too much. Generally speaking, you should be fine with:One red-meat canape (such as beef or pork)
One white-meat canape (like fish or chicken)
One vegetarian or vegan canape;
, If you want to impress your guests’ tastebuds, but feel wary about ordering something too exotic or overpriced, then consider the time of year that your wedding will take place. Focus on canapes featuring ingredients that happen to be in season during those months. Delight people’s tastebuds with freshness instead of trying to blow them away with something out-of-this-world. To find out which meats and produce are in season during your wedding, search online for charts like this one: http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/seasonal-calendar/all


, If you feel overwhelmed by all the options out there, use your reception's theme to narrow down your choices. If you don't have a theme, make one up. Don't worry: you don't necessarily have to redo your entire menu, decorations, and other stuff to fit it. Just keep it to yourself if you want and use your private theme to settle more quickly on a decision. For instance, you could:


Feature a specific canape or key ingredient that you and your partner discovered together on a trip, holiday, or first date.
Highlight the location of your wedding by focusing on locally grown ingredients or regional specialties., Keep any dietary concerns that your guests may have in mind. Always offer more than one option so they have a choice in case one type contains ingredients that they can’t eat. At the same time, don’t feel like you’re obligated to address every issue imaginable. Order what you want to serve, and then settle on a single alternate canape that meets as many issues as possible all at once.Serving a specific canape to address just one issue, and then another kind to address a second issue (and then another, and then another) will just give you a headache and stretch your budget.

, Use this to address many issues at once. At the very least, offer a meat-free canape for any vegetarians on your guest list, plus any omnivores who may have dietary issues with particular meats. If needed, go a step further and make it vegan to address both vegans and anyone with issues like lactose intolerance or religious concerns. For instance:Say you want to serve three kinds of canapes, one of which is pork, and another is tuna. Some guests may have religious objections to pork and/or seafood allergies.

, Before choosing your menu, include allergen response cards with your wedding invitations. Ask guests to fill in any foods that they’re allergic to and send it back to you. Use their feedback to narrow down your selections when the time comes to pick which types of canapes to serve.If 50 out of 100 guests all have nut allergies, then obviously you’re better off nixing any items made with nuts or nut oils.
If only one person has it, though, just try to include at least one canape that doesn’t contain nuts, and inform that guest of which ones to avoid.

, If one or more dietary issues are shared by many guests, make this a criteria when hiring your caterer. When you interview potential candidates, inform them of the dietary concern(s) in question. Ask them if they have experience in tailoring menus to meet these needs. Even if they answer yes, it may still be worth pursuing a company that specializes in that specific area instead. For instance:Say that 75% of your guests are vegan. Caterer A may be able to come up with a vegan menu even though they don’t do this regularly. However, Caterer B, who specializes in vegan menus, will have more experience in making the most out of select ingredients.
Or, let’s say 75% of your guests follow a strict kosher diet. Caterer A may offer a menu that’s kosher on paper, but kosher laws also govern how food should be prepared. If their kitchen isn’t equipped for this, you’re better off finding a caterer who specializes in it.

, First, plan to serve your canapes during your cocktail reception. Then decide how long that will last. Next, ask yourself if you’re planning on following the cocktail reception up with a full meal. For now, assume all your guests are adults and then plan on ordering enough canapes so each guest receives:One canape every 30 minutes before a meal is served.
One canape every 15 minutes if no meal is served.

, Expect some age groups to consume more than others. Before you do the math, go over your guest list. Determine the age of each guest and divide them between Children, Young Adults, Adults, and Seniors. Expect:


Children (12 years old and younger) to consume about half the amount that an adult would.
Young adults (13 years old to early 20’s) to eat at least twice the amount that an older adult would.
Seniors (65 years old and up) to have smaller appetites than middle-aged adults.

, If you decided against serving a full meal, consider the timing of your reception. If possible, schedule it outside of traditional meal hours. Allow your guests time to eat their breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner on their own. If you do end up hosting your reception during meal hours, expect your guests to treat your canapes as a meal and consume more than indicated above. Traditionally, meal times fall between:Breakfast: 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.
Lunch: 12 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
Dinner: 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.

, Expect canapes to be pretty tasty, but not necessarily all that filling. Plan on offering more than just canapes if you’re foregoing a meal and/or inviting a lot of young adults or other big eaters. Provide your caterer with the number of guests so they can pair the canapes with a more substantial platter.Otherwise (or even in addition to that), come up with a fallback plan ahead of time in case the food runs out by:Finding nearby restaurants offering delivery and/or pick-up.
Confirming they can handle large orders on short notice.
Asking for an estimated wait time so you know how soon to order.
Setting aside an emergency budget.
Designating someone to handle this task during the reception so you can enjoy your own wedding day.

It takes at least 30 tons of stone to make one gold ring., Determine whether their natural style is modern or traditional and whether they want their ring to be flashy or more conservative. Choose a ring style that matches their unique personality and purchase one they can appreciate one that they will appreciate.

, When you are looking for a wedding band, you'll need to know the person's ring size. You can figure this out by asking them or taking one of their rings to determine the size.

For example, if you want to be conservative, you can set a budget at around $2,000. If you want to be more extravagant, you can set a budget of up to $10,000. There are ways you can buy an engagement ring for even less if you are on a strict budget.

, Vintage-inspired, vintage, and antique rings are all different. Vintage-inspired rings are new rings created in the style of the past. Vintage rings are rings that have been worn before and that are between 20 to 99 years old. Antique rings are over 100 years old.The difference between the three will be price, condition, and availability. For example, most jewelry stores will carry vintage-inspired engagement rings. Many of these styles are similar. Depending on what you buy and where you buy it, the antique ring may be cheaper or the vintage-inspired ring may be cheaper.
Antique rings can be harder to find because of how old they are. Actual vintage rings can give you the opportunity to have a more unique engagement ring.

Select the shape of your stone.,
Choose the size of the stone.,
Look at the quality of the stone.,
Find a stone that has the sparkle and brilliance you desire.,
Consider adding accent diamonds or other stones to the engagement ring.

",How to Choose a Stone for an Engagement Ring," If you choose a diamond, the color can vary more than you might think. The GIA's color-grading scale ranges from D to Z. The most valuable diamonds are graded D, which means they are colorless. Diamonds that are graded Z have a light-yellow hue.;

Flawless diamonds, which are quite rare, are graded FL. Diamonds with inclusions that are visible to the naked eye are given an I3 grade. There are 9 grades in between.

Discuss what type of music you want with your future spouse.,
Develop a compromise, if you disagree.,
Select music that fits the style of your ceremony.,
Choose music that works with your venue.",How to Choose Music for a Wedding Ceremony1," The wedding ceremony is about both of you. Work together to decide what tone and genre(s) you would like for your wedding music. Consider whether you want your music to be traditional, trendy, or something entirely unique to you as a couple.


Even if you are more involved in the planning than your future spouse, help them feel included by asking them about their opinion. For example, you could say, “How would you feel about classical music during the ceremony?”
Write down any ideas you come up with while you brainstorm together, so that you don’t forget them later.;
, You may find yourselves at an impasse if you have strongly different preferences in music. However, remember that you will need music for several different parts of the ceremony, so you may be able to compromise by selecting different styles for different moments.

For example, one of you might select more traditional music for the prelude and processionals, while the other picks contemporary music for the recessional.
If you disagree, acknowledge your future spouse’s feelings, and let them know that their opinions are valid.
You could say, “I know how important it is to you to keep most of the music traditional, but it would also mean so much to me if I could walk up the aisle to my favorite Norah Jones song.”

, Different types of weddings have different structures and different vibes. Select the kind of music that you think fits best with the ceremony you have in mind.

For example, if you’re having a low-key beach wedding, contemporary pop music or romantic oldies might be a good fit.
For a very traditional or religious ceremony, you might want to stick with hymns or classical music. Speak to your officiant if you have any doubts about what might be appropriate., The venue that you select will have an impact on what kind of music you can use. Before putting together a setlist, check with your venue to find out if they have any rules and restrictions regarding wedding music.Other things to consider include:


Is your venue big enough for the kind of ensemble you want?
Is your venue indoors, or outdoors? For example, a beach wedding might not be an ideal setting for a grand piano.
Does your venue already provide instruments or musicians? E.g., if you are having your wedding in a church, an organist might be provided by the venue.

Choose a round bouquet for a traditional look.,

Use a loose bouquet for a relaxed tone.,

Choose a crescent bouquet for formal weddings.,

Consider the flexible pageant bouquet.,

For a plentiful appearance, consider the cascade bouquet.,

If you have a big dress, use the oval bouquet.,

Choose the heart bouquet to symbolize love and affection.",How to Choose the Shape of Your Bridal Bouquet," The round bouquet is the oldest and most traditional of all bouquet shapes. It is incredibly versatile, working well with almost all wedding dress styles, brides, settings, and levels of formality. It can be composed of multiple colors, or a single hue; with uniform flowers, or ones of varying sizes and species. The globular arrangement is easy to make -- and cheaper to purchase, and allows for the round shape to be made larger or smaller depending on the bride's needs and preferences.
, The loose bouquet (also referred to as organic or hand-tied) is exactly what the name says. A collection of loosely tied flowers and ribbon, this bouquet lends an air of relaxation and tranquility. They are ideal for outdoor venues or beach weddings. See How to Make a Hand Tied Wedding Bouquet., Usually symmetrical, these flower arrangements are preferred for their natural look. The flowers just seem to ""flow"" across the hands. (The bouquet is thick in the middle and tapers down as it nears the floor.) Depending on the flowers used and the length of the ""arms"" the crescent can be made to look traditional or more modern., The pageant bouquet is characterized by long stems. They are usually arranged in such a way that the stems lay against the bride's arm, with the cluster of flower heads near her elbow. This style is great for formal occasions and, if tied loosely, can be ideal for informal occasions as well., This bouquet resembles a waterfall. The flowers ""spill"" out of the front of the bouquet, and are best for formal settings. It does require a lot of flowers though, as the base is bulky and the flowers trail downwards., The oval bouquet is best when only comprised of two different colors. It is similar to the round style, but is much better at complementing larger wedding dresses (like ballgowns) than many other arrangements., One color only! This bouquet's impact comes from the shape of the bouquet, not necessarily the flowers or their colors."

Pick songs that are meaningful to both of you.,
Select quiet, atmospheric songs for the prelude.,
Choose a few powerful pieces for the processionals.,
Play upbeat songs during the recessional.,
Include your songs in the rehearsal.",How to Choose Music for a Wedding Ceremony2," Think about songs or pieces of music that say something to you, or about you, as a couple. Depending on the type of ceremony you are having, this could mean anything from a hymn that expresses a shared spiritual belief to a sweet love song that you danced to at your first date.


Don’t be afraid to break away from traditional wedding favorites. For example, if you’re both huge Beatles fans, you could play “All You Need is Love” as you walk up the aisle.

, This is the period before the ceremony starts, when the guests are being seated. Plan on starting the prelude music 20 minutes or so before the ceremony starts.For the prelude, instrumental music is a good way to go. If you’re going with classical music, a simple but evocative piece like J. S. Bach’s Cello Suite No. 1 could be a perfect moodsetter.

, This is the part of the ceremony where the members of the wedding party and the couple make their entrances. Traditionally, a separate piece of music is played for a bride’s entrance. You might select a song for each of your entrances. Everyone’s attention will be on whomever is walking up the aisle, so choose a piece of music that fits the person or people.Traditional processional favorites include the chorus of Wagner’s “Wedding March” from Lohengrin (which you may know as “Here Comes the Bride”), or Pachelbel’s Canon in D.
Many couples today opt for more contemporary pieces, like Christina Perry’s “A Thousand Years” or “Marry Me” by Train., This is when everyone walks back down the aisle after the ceremony is complete. Recessional music is usually upbeat and celebratory, since it marks the start of your life as a married couple.The traditional recessional piece that most people are familiar with is Mendelssohn’s stately “Wedding March,” typically played on an organ.
If you’re looking for a more fun and modern alternative, consider something like “First Day of My Life” by Bright Eyes., Once you have picked your songs, make sure that they fit with the timing of your ceremony. It’s especially important to practice the processionals with the music. If you can, do a practice run with the musician(s) or DJ who will be providing music at your wedding."
"
Decide on a budget for your music.,
Do research on musicians in your area.,
Try to see a live performance.,
Arrange a meeting.,
Hire a friend to perform, if you’re on a tight budget.",How to Choose Music for a Wedding Ceremony3," A solo musician or a DJ is likely to charge less to play at your wedding than a big ensemble. Before you start looking for musicians, take a look at your wedding budget and decide on a maximum amount you are willing or able to pay for the music.

If you’re not sure what the typical rates are for wedding musicians in your area, discuss it with a wedding planner or check out a site like Costhelper.com to get an idea of what to expect., Do an internet search for musicians or DJs who perform at weddings in your area. If you know what type of group or musician you are looking for, you can narrow down your options with an entertainment directory like GigMasters.com.While you are looking at your options, make note of:


Reviews and testimonials from others who have hired the musician(s) you’re interested in.
Quoted price ranges. Do they fit your budget?
Music samples. Listen to recordings or clips of the musician/group performing to make sure their style fits your needs.

, If you can, check out live performances by a few of the musicians or DJs you are most interested in hiring. This will give you a better idea of how their music sounds in person and what sort of dynamic they have with an audience. This is also a good opportunity to make a face-to-face connection and get an idea of how well you might work together., Once you’ve narrowed down your choices to a couple of different options, contact your potential wedding performers and arrange to meet with them as a couple. Make sure that you’re all on the same page, and that they can work with your schedule, song choices, and venue.Once you’ve agreed to work together, make sure to put your agreement in a formal contract.

, If you have any friends who are musicians or DJs, consider asking them to perform at your wedding. Your friend will probably be honored to be asked, and will appreciate the work. Having a friend play or DJ for you will also add an extra personal touch to the ceremony.

While you should not expect your friend to perform for free, they will probably be willing to offer you a rate that is considerably lower than the industry standard.

Sit down with your significant other and whoever else may be involved with the budgeting of your wedding, and discuss the target budget that you would like to adhere to when choosing your decorations.For the average wedding, flower costs account for 8-10% of the total wedding budget. All wedding decorations, including the flowers, should account for about 10-18% of your budget.
The bigger your wedding, the more decorations you will need for the wedding ceremony and reception. You can save money on your wedding decorations by having a smaller wedding or in a venue that already is significantly decorated.;
, Though you may know that you want pink wedding decorations, there are many other factors in picking out your perfect wedding décor. Before you start looking at decorations, pinpoint exactly what kinds of pink decorations you want at your wedding.The most common types of wedding decorations are the flowers at the ceremony, the flowers at the reception, reception table centerpieces, table linens, table place names, and hanging lighting or centerpieces.
Your wedding may include all of these design elements, or only some of them. Assess the venue and size of your wedding to decide which decorations you may need.
For instance, if you are holding your reception in a grand historical ballroom, it may already come with chandeliers and adequate lighting, so you may not need to buy or rent lighting or hanging centerpieces.

, With so many options to choose from, picking wedding decorations can be daunting, even if you’ve narrowed down your search to one color. To feel less intimidated by the process, begin by looking in bridal catalogs and magazines and online at pictures of pink wedding décor. Save pictures of decorations you like and make a mood board, either by making a physical collage or using a site like Pinterest to catalog the pictures you want to save.

, Once you have decided on a budget as well as the types of decorations you need at your wedding, look into floral designers and/or wedding designers in your city. Go onto their websites and read reviews of their work to help you narrow down your choice.Contact the designers that most interest you and ask for an estimate, based on the decorations that you need and the size of your wedding. Then choose a designer or designers based on their estimates and their work.
There is also the option of buying decoration from separate places rather than from one or two designers. However, it is less likely that the decorations you buy will end up matching each other, and it also may not save you any significant amount of money.

, After you have picked out a designer or designers, meet to discuss your ideas. Share any important information with them, such as the size of your wedding, the ceremony and reception venues, and the specific types of decorations that you need, such as flowers, table centerpieces, etc.Bring along your mood board or pull it up on your phone or personal computer to give your designer a better idea about what styles of decorations interest you.

, There are many different ways that you can go with your wedding decorations. The fact that you want pink decorations is a start, but there are also many other aspects to decorations apart from color. Start by brainstorming a list of adjectives that describe the aesthetic that you want for your wedding.Some adjectives that you could use as a starting point could be “classic”, “rustic”, “summery”, “minimalist” or “extravagant.”

, Your wedding decorations shouldn’t just be beautiful on their own; they also look good when grouped together. Use the adjectives that you generated to choose decorations that look great together, even if they are all coming from different places.For instance, maybe you are having a rustic, outdoor style wedding. You may wish to have table centerpieces of dark pink and white wildflowers with dark green leaves in glass jars. You could compliment the centerpieces by using simple white linens, along with white name cards that have deep magenta trim and the guests’ names written in fuchsia and twinkling white and pink lights overhead.
If you are having an extravagant, period-style wedding, you may choose to have a large chandelier hanging centerpiece with pink and white crystals, tall centerpieces with pink and red roses and white baby’s breath flowers, intricately embroidered linens with light pink detailing, and pink and white candles on every table.

, Even if you know that you want pink wedding decorations, don’t limit yourself to just one color or shade of pink. It’s a good idea to have a mix of shades of color, as one color can look flat and repetitive.


For instance, you may decide to base your colors off of one shade of baby pink, which you use as the primary color in your wedding and venue flowers, your table centerpieces, and your plates and wine glasses. To bring out the beauty of this baby pink color, you may offset the color with magenta and cream-colored flowers, table settings and decorations.
Neutral shades like white or cream go with any shade of pink, and are a great way to offset the color.

, In addition to picking pink shades that you like, you also have to consider the colors used in your venue. You don’t want to pick out your decorations only to have the colors clash with those of your wedding venue.If you are having your wedding in a neutral-colored venue such as a white hall without any bold colors, any shade of pink will work. However, if you are having your wedding or reception in an unusually colored venue such as a reception room with pea green walls, make sure to use pink shades that don’t clash with the venue color.
If you need help knowing what colors go together, ask the help of your wedding designer. There are also many Internet resources on color theory that are good guides to color pairing.

, Flowers are usually the most expensive decorative element of a wedding, and there are many factors that go into choosing the right flowers. Even if you have some idea of what flowers you would like and know you want mostly pink flowers, consult with your floral designer or wedding planner before making any major moves.If you have already bought any other decorative pieces for your wedding, show your florist pictures of these decorations. Make sure your florist knows the date of the wedding as well as your vision of how you will be using flowers in ceremonial and reception space.

, Because flowers are among the most important and eye-catching decorative aspects of a wedding, it’s important to use several varied colors and types of flowers to add interest to your arrangements. Use several different types of flowers as opposed to one type. As much as you may love one type of classic pink flower like roses or tulips, it’s important to have variety in your floral arrangements. Using a few different species of flowers will save your arrangements from looking boring and repetitive.
Mix up the color and texture of your arrangements. Use flowers with different shapes and sizes, as well as different shades of pink and white to give your floral arrangements an eye-catching look.

, Even if you fall in love with a certain variety of pink flowers, you have to keep a few things in mind before making major floral decisions. Be sure to ask your florist if the flowers will be in season during the month of your wedding. If they won’t be in season, they may not be available that time of year, and they also may cost more., Another consideration to keep in mind is whether the flowers have a strong smell. Your guests will be in close proximity to hundreds of flowers the day of your wedding, and you don’t want to have to worry about any of your guests having allergic reactions because of your choices in décor! Pick mild-smelling or unscented flowers to avoid allergy problems., Another thing that you don’t want to have to worry about on your wedding day is drooping flowers. Some flowers, like hydrangeas, are beautiful but require constant moisture after picking. Choose flowers that can survive a day out of water without drooping or dying."

Consider wearing a headband or hairpiece.,
Try a sash with rose gold detailing.",How to Choose Rose Gold Wedding Jewelry," Rose gold is sometimes cheaper than other types of gold because it is an alloy. Gold is mixed with copper to form rose gold, which is what gives it its rosy hue. Copper is usually cheaper than gold, making the metal more affordable overall., If you're looking at rose gold for wedding rings, it's a good option. Rose gold is a harder metal than white or yellow gold because of the copper, which is a strong metal. Therefore, you're less likely to damage it in everyday wear., If you're in love with the idea of having rose gold jewelry at your wedding, be prepared to look around more. While rose gold is becoming more popular and therefore, more widely available, it's still not as easy to find as other types of metal, such as white or yellow gold., Many people choose rose gold because of its soft pink hue. The pink hue gives a romantic feel to the jewelry, perfect for any wedding. As an added bonus, rose gold does well on almost any skin tone, making it a great choice for your wedding party., While you can use rose gold with contemporary-style settings, rose gold does especially well with vintage-style settings. That's because the rosy hue gives the metal a vintage, artistic feel, perfect for older styles of rings and jewelry.One reason rose gold goes well with vintage settings is because it was popular in the 1920s.You could play up that vintage look by wearing a dress that has a vintage feel, such as one that has vintage-style lace or that has a geometric art deco-style design. You could also try wearing a headband reminiscent of the era.

, One nice aspect of rose gold is it mixes well with white gold and yellow gold. Therefore, wedding pieces that incorporate all three can make for stunning statement pieces. Plus, the combination will help the pieces go well with any colors you choose for your wedding., When using rose gold for your wedding jewelry, consider going for a slightly rosier color in your wedding dress. A blush or a champagne shade will go well with rose gold. Even something like a diamond white (a light off-white) will look good with rose gold., Rose gold can go with a variety of colors, including cooler colors like turquoise and purple. However, it will look especially good with warm colors, such as yellow, orange, red, and brown., If you have a very simple gown, you can play around with different necklace styles. You can complement the simplicity of the gown by choosing a more ornate rose gold necklace. The opposite is also true. If your gown is bedazzled or ornate from head to toe, you want to keep your jewelry simpler to avoid looking too busy.Make sure that your rose gold jewelry works with the beading or embellishments of the dress. For instance, if your beading has silver in it, try choosing rose gold pieces that also incorporate silver or white gold.Beading will give your dress a vintage feel, if that's what you want for your wedding.

, It’s important that your rose gold necklace lays beautifully with the neckline, rather than making it look busy or taking attention away from the gown. Necklaces work particularly well with V-neck gowns, where the necklace lays on the exposed skin. With other necklines, it may be a better idea to skip the necklace and choose earrings or a hair accessory instead.If the neckline of your gown is asymmetrical, definitely skip the necklace. Having a necklace will throw off the effect created by the dramatic cut., If you are wearing a big, ornate necklace, skip the big, ornate earrings (and vice versa). If you are dripping in big, rose gold accessories, you will distract from your gown and your own wedding-day glow. If you fall in love with dramatic earrings and a big statement necklace, just pick one. You don’t want to look back at your wedding photos and kick yourself for over-accessorizing.Don't forget to work with your hairstyle. Before choosing your rose gold earrings for the big day, determine how you’re going to wear your hair. Large chandelier earrings will be less dramatic if you’re wearing your hair down than if it's in a sleek up-do. If you have visions of big, full curls worn down around your face, you may want to wear simpler earrings.

, If you are choosing to wear a veil at your wedding, try your favorite rose gold earrings with your veil, as it's important that the two accessories complement each other. For example, an intricate, lace veil might work best with simple earrings, while a small, tulle veil can probably work with bigger, more dramatic earrings. The key is balance., A bracelet is a traditional wedding day choice, and there is a style for every gown. If your gown has an ornate neckline and you’re forgoing a necklace, a dazzling rose gold bracelet can add the sparkle you need. A simple bracelet can add a sweet yet understated touch to a more elaborate dress. Remember, your bracelet will be on display as you hold your bouquet, so pick a piece you love.


Chunky bangles or big cuffs can slide around your arms. Wear your jewelry before your wedding so you know if it’ll be bothersome or distracting. If it is, skip it for your ceremony, and then bring it out for the reception., If you want to add some rose gold shimmer to your look but aren’t a big jewelry person, you can always incorporate a rose gold hairpiece. Check out the options for rose gold crowns, tiaras, hairpins, or barrettes. If you find a piece you love, you can bring it to your wedding day hairstylist and have them work it into your wedding day hairdo.

The cut describes the way the diamond was shaped to reflect the light. The cuts should be at the right depth and angle to produce a fiery sparkle.

Diamonds come in a variety of colors, and selecting one over the other is a matter of personal preference. Diamond colors typically include silver, white, clear, and shades of yellow.
A carat is a unit of measure that describes a diamond’s weight. Diamonds with higher carats are more expensive, but a lower carat diamond can appear larger in the right mounting or setting."

These rings usually incorporate delicate nature motifs like flowers, plants, leaves, and even insects into the metalwork.If you wish to have an intricate, organic engagement ring, look for rings from these time periods.

Georgian rings usually incorporate flowers, leaves, and other natural elements into the design, but it is quite difficult to find these older rings intact.Victorian rings also incorporated nature motifs along with hearts, birds, and bows. In addition to diamonds, opals can be found in Victorian rings.Edwardian rings were delicate and typically made of platinum. These designs often included milgraining, which describes a small strand of beads or pearls that wrap around the edges of the ring or stone., Art nouveau was a popular style during the turn of the 19th century. The focus was on craftsmanship, so the intricate, organic designs took precedence over the material and gemstones., During the jazz age, there was a shift from natural designs to geometric styles with sharp lines. Art deco engagement rings often used emeralds, rubies, and sapphires more often than diamonds. King Tut’s tomb was unearthed in Egypt during this time, so many art deco rings are inspired by the geometric, ridged lines of ancient Egyptian art., Retro rings are inspired by the Hollywood style of the 1930s. These rings are large, bold, and often incorporate semi-precious stones like amethyst and citrine into their designs. These rings often use gold instead of platinum., Modern rings describe rings made during and since the 1950s. During this time, there was a lot of economic growth. The design focus shifted from intricate, linear designs and semi-precious gemstones. Modern rings aim to highlight a sparkling diamond, so the style became less dramatic and intricate than the designs of the past."

, Not all minimalist bands are completely smooth. Some have simple embellishments that add a bit of personality and uniqueness to the ring. You can choose from a split band or a few stones embedded into the band.For example, a minimalist band may have two lines of simple metal on the band. It may also have a few small stones embedded into the band beside the main setting, or have large simple stones embedded into the band. Some bands may have chevrons or lines etched into the band.
You may also choose a ring with small diamonds that go all the way around, but each diamond is set into the band in a circular, geometric, or teardrop shape all the way around.

, Any metal can be used in a minimalist engagement ring. Yellow gold, white gold, and platinum are the most popular choices.

What is it that you’re picturing? If you’re at a loss for how to get started, this type of mental exercise can help put you on the right track.;
, Get a sense of what you’re willing and able to spend on a wedding ring. This can help eliminate a lot of superfluous options right off the bat. Decide whether you’d rather finance a ring or buy it outright. Come up with an approximate figure that you’d be willing to drop on a piece and only look for rings in that price range.If possible, create a separate “ring fund” and set aside a small amount from each paycheck to go toward purchasing the ideal ring once you find it., Where should you even begin looking?

Stay away from pawn shops, deep discount outlets and mall jewelry kiosks that try to pass off uncertified merchandise at questionable prices.The internet can be a helpful tool in previewing types of rings, but it’s probably not your best resource for buying due to the inability to assess the quality of a ring up close, complications in getting it sized properly and a lack of live specialists who can inform you and answer any questions you may have in person.

Iron is the agent that gives the amethyst its purple hue. The shade can vary from a pale reddish-violet to medium violet to deep blackish-purple. The most valuable amethysts are those that are deep purple with rose, blue, or red flashes.;
,


Amethysts do not display their truest or best colors in artificial indoor lighting. Ask to see the stone outside in the daylight or under a jewelers light.

,


A good quality amethyst is transparent. If you hold it up to the light, the light should travel completely through the stone. Amethysts of high quality should be completely clear and should not contain inclusions. Also, check the surface of the ring to make sure there are no nicks or scratches.
The prongs or edges of the stone's setting within the ring should be secure, with no loose or sharp edges, and no chips in the stone itself.

, Many jewelers have websites where you can read testimonials from other customers.


If you plan to buy more gemstones, you might also consider joining a gemstone club to become more well-versed on how to select high quality stones and where to get them.

,


If you want a darker stone, you are going to pay more. The highest priced amethysts are Deep Russians, which are rare and carry an average cost of about $50,000 per carat.

It is always possible that, once you get your amethyst home, you will discover a flaw in the stone you did not see before you left the store. Make certain you can return or exchange your item should this occur.

Go shopping with your partner.,
Educate yourself on ring materials.,
Complement your partner’s style preferences.,
Pick out the perfect ring for you.",How to Buy a Wedding Ring2," Go together to pick out a set of rings that the two of your can agree on. Buying a wedding ring is a big, expensive decision, and it’s one that the two of you should make together. This way you can confer about what you like and don’t like, keep each other’s expectations in check and even come to an agreement on a set of matching rings. Whatever the case, make sure you’re both present and have equal say in the matter.Your wedding ring is one of the only pieces of jewelry that you’ll wear for years to come—perhaps even the rest of your life—so it only makes sense to bring your partner along to pick it out.
Schedule a day when you and your partner can devote several hours to visiting jewelry stores and looking at rings together.

, To choose a wedding ring that's right for you and your partner, you should consider the many different kinds of metals used to make rings. Gold and platinum are time-honored favorites, but a host of other materials are available to you in addition to these options: silver is another popular rare metal, and is sometimes mixed with gold and other metals to create unique amalgamations of color and shine. Aside from the traditional metals, you also have benefits of modern metals like cobalt, tungsten and titanium, which are renowned for their durability, vibrancy and ease of cleaning. It's important to communicate with your partner to achieve the right look and construction of your wedding rings.In addition to being harder and more durable, you may also be able to save money by opting for some of the more modern material choices.
Your ring doesn't have to be metal at all—take cues from other cultural traditions and look at rings fashioned from precious stones like jade, or even bohemian alternatives like wood or bone., If you happen to be on the hunt for a one-of-a-kind wedding ring or you’re buying the ring as a surprise, go armed with an awareness of your significant other’s affinities. Do they have a favorite metal that they tend to accessorize in? Are they partial to any particular colors, inlays or band styles? Study your partner’s jewelry collection or bring it up casually in conversation beforehand to be able to tailor your search for something that you know they’ll love.It is a major plus if the ring you buy is consistent with the other jewelry and accessories your partner typically wears.

, Aim to find a pair of rings that suits you and your partner's specific needs. One of the most important truths to keep in mind is that there’s no such thing as a perfect ring, only a perfect ring for you. With this in mind, you should stay focused on you and your partner’s preferences, uniqueness and buying power and stop convincing yourself that there exists a “best” ring out there. If it meets the criteria you’ve set, symbolizes your devotion to one another and makes you smile when you look at it, it’s perfect.


There is an almost limitless variety of metals, moldings, sizes and styles available, and you’ll never be able to look at all of them. Instead, keep a clear image in mind of what best represents you and your partner.

Pick out a ring that is meaningful to your partner.,
Assess the ""Four Cs"" when deciding on a gemstone.,
Choose the right style.,
Make it a surprise.",How to Buy a Wedding Ring3," Research your partner's style preferences to find out what kind of ring would make them happy. Have they always wanted a brilliant diamond, or would it be more dazzling to have the ring set with a colorful stone? Pay attention when your partner mentions what kind of styles they like, and take a look at some of their other jewelry for comparison. A wedding proposal is a momentous occasion, and they've probably been dreaming all their life about the day someone pops the question with the perfect ring.Having an engagement ring set with your partner's birthstone can be a moving alternative to the traditional diamond.Using your partner's other jewelry for reference can save you a lot of trouble weeding out options. For instance, if most of the rings and necklaces they own are silver, it's a safe bet that they are partial to silver over other decorative metals.

, In jeweler’s lingo, the “four Cs” refer to the Cut, Carat, Clarity and Color of diamonds and other precious gemstones. These are the most important qualities to look for when shopping for a ring set with a stone, and since you’ll be shelling out a lot of money for it, it can pay to know how to appraise what you’re shown. If you have a notion of what you’re after in terms of each “C,” you’ll also have a much easier time communicating your needs to the jewelry specialist.Cut deals with the shape and texture of a stone. These might come in their raw forms, or they can be cut with precise angles for greater symmetry and appeal.
Carat is a term that denotes a stone’s size. The higher the number of carats, the bigger the rock, and the more you can expect to pay for it.
Clarity is a desirable trait of gemstones that have a uniform, translucent appearance and are lacking any unwanted imperfections in shape.
Color refers to the natural hues of a stone, and is largely a matter of preference. Diamonds of the highest purity are most often clear or opalescent, but they can also be red, pink or blue, and some of these colors are exceedingly rare and valuable.

, Shopping for an engagement ring isn't just about picking the type, size and cut of a particular stone. Look at metals and setting types that you think would capture your partner's heart. Gold is the most traditional metal for engagement rings and wedding bands, but there are many others. Modern styles favor sleek, colorless metals, so silver or platinum might be your best bet. You'll also need to decide how the stone is to be set in the ring: it could have a single setting at the top, or be inlaid with multiple stones around the band. The choices are virtually endless.Expect to have to make a decision about a minimum of four areas: metal, band style, setting style and stone.
Confer with your jeweler about your spouse's preferences. They can help you pair different elements and narrow down your search.

, Unlike agreeing on a set of wedding rings, which should be a joint decision, the engagement ring is usually given as a surprise. Plan to present the ring to your significant other when they least expect it. Find a creative way of asking the big question or hiding the ring to thrill your partner when they find it on their own. Make sure you've done your homework and are confident with the ring you've chosen before surprising them to avoid disappointment.Surprises are fun, but be careful not to place the ring anywhere they you may lose or ruin it. It's advisable not to hide an engagement ring in food (this presents a choking hazard and may destroy the metal's finish), or have it out of the jewelry box somewhere that it may fall into a crevice or under a piece of furniture."

Be realistic about price.,
Save up to buy a ring.,
Purchase the ring on a payment plan.,
Talk to the jeweler about possible discounts.",How to Buy a Wedding Ring4," Settle on a ring you love that’s within your means and make sure you’re in a financially responsible position to afford it. Have a budget in place and refer to it before making any rash buying decisions. A wedding ring isn’t a make-believe decoration. It’s a serious investment, and no matter who you are, buying a quality ring that’s up to your standards is going to leave a dent in your checkbook. Try not to have any unrealistic expectations about finding a storybook ring for a steal. For the most part, you get what you pay for: quality metals and custom engravings are simply going to cost more.Resist the temptation to spend beyond your means. It’s one thing to live a little lighter for a while until you make up the cost, but spending more money than you have on a ring that you simply can’t afford is ill-advised., Instead of projecting an estimate of what you might spend on a ring and using that figure to inform your search, you might also consider finding a ring you like first and then saving up for it. Again, having a ring fund set up can be an invaluable aid, as all that money will have already been cleared for the purpose of buying a ring and won’t cause any unexpected hiccups in paying the rent or keeping the lights on. Purchasing a ring outright can also be a great weight off your shoulders—it might be a big expense all at one time, but once it’s yours, it’s yours.Quality rings are not cheap. It’s wisest to start saving up for a wedding ring as far as you can in advance.
In certain stores, it may be possible to negotiate the price of an item a little with the jeweler. Knowing that you’re committed to buying a ring then and there may be enough to convince the jeweler to haggle with you until you reach a price you can both live with.

, Realistically, most shoppers will be better off financing their ring of choice. Possible payment plans will differ depending on store policy where you buy your ring, but generally you’ll feel less financially limited if you have the option of paying the ring off a little at a time rather than in one fell swoop. Read the fine print of the jeweler’s payment plan paperwork, and, if possible, look for plans with zero interest or promotional rates that expire after a certain time. If you’re not careful, you might get stuck paying considerably more than you originally anticipated.Be wary of financing plans offered by jewelry stores. Their rates may seem attractive at first, but can skyrocket after the advertised promotions expire, and may leave you with the burden of debt in addition to your shiny new ring.If you’ve got your eye on a ring that you can’t live without but it’s a little out of your current price range, an installment plan might be just what you need, since you’ll be able to pay as you go.

Select a cut that maximizes sparkle and beauty.,
Equip yourself with knowledge about diamond color.,
Identify your ideal clarity.,
Take florescence into account.,
View potential diamonds from above.,
Pick the best shape for your diamond.,
Verify the diamond is certified.",How to Buy a Diamond Ring1," The cut of a diamond will influence how the stone redirects light, causing it to glitter. Many consider this to be the most important feature of a diamond ring. Even an expensive diamond, if cut poorly, can look lackluster. The main categories of cut are:Ideal cut (sometimes called ""Excellent""), reflects the most light possible back to your eyes, making the diamond sparkle brightly.
Very good cut, reflects slightly less light back to your eyes than an ideal cut.
Good cut, reflects most of the light that enters the diamond back to your eyes.
Fair cut, reflects noticeably less light than a good cut, but is generally considered to still be a quality gemstone.;
, When a diamond seller talks about the color of a diamond, they're actually referring to its lack of color. Diamonds are rated on a scale that goes from D to Z. Diamonds that are perfectly white are the most desirable/expensive and are ranked at D.


Color grades can be minutely different from each other. Selecting a diamond with a unnoticeably lower color grade can save you a significant amount of money.
Ranks F to E will only have minimal traces of color that can only be detected by a professional gemologist.
Ranks H to G are nearly colorless. The difference between these and higher color grade diamonds will only be noticeable when compared side by side.
Ranks J to I will generally have a detectable warmth to their color tone, usually in the form of yellowness, but are still considered to be near colorless.
Ranks worse than I will have noticeable yellow tones coloring the gem., Even the most expensive diamonds will likely have minute flaws and imperfections. Gem experts call these ""inclusions."" For high quality diamonds, these inclusions may only be visible with a microscope. However, too many flaws or the wrong kinds of flaws can make your diamond cloudy.Clarity grades, from flawless to visible flawed, are rated: FL (flawless), IF (internally flawed), VVS1, VVS2 (very, very slightly included), VS1, VS2 (very slightly included), SI1, SI2 (slightly included), and I1 (included).
You might save some money by choosing an SI1 clarity diamond. These often only have flaws visible under magnification, making them a more economical purchase without looking cheap.
Before purchasing a diamond with a SI rank or worse, verify with the seller that the diamond is ""eye clean."" This means there are no imperfections visible to the naked eye., Small amounts of boron are frequently trapped in diamonds, causing a slightly milky appearance in the stone. This is called ""florescence,"" and it is rated from Faint to Very Strong.


Unless you are able to appraise a diamond in natural light to ensure there is no milkiness, you should avoid Strong or Very Strong florescent stones., Looking at your diamond from above will give you a better idea of how the stone will look when placed in a setting. While most people evaluate the size of a diamond by carat weight (CTW), this can be deceptive. Even small diamonds that have been cut correctly can appear sizable.You'll also want to look at potential diamonds in many different kinds of lighting. Some stones look beautiful in bright light, but lose their appeal in everyday lighting.
Carat total weight (CTW) is the weight of all the diamonds in the ring, including side stones.
When only the CTW is listed, ask the diamond seller about the quality and weight of the centerpiece stone. If the seller does not want to share this information, this is likely a sign a sign that the diamond is low quality., The shape of your diamond will highlight different features. Round brilliant cuts will bring out the sparkle in your diamond. Step cut diamonds, like Asscher and emerald cuts, will reflect flashes of light as opposed to sparkle. Longer shapes, like oval, pear, and marquise cuts, can be suitable for longer fingers. Some other shapes for your consideration:


Round
Princess
Emerald
Radiant
Heart
Cushion, You'll want your diamond to have been graded by an independent authority so you know you're really getting what you're paying for. This is also known as a certificate, and will include an evaluation of cut, clarity, color, carat weight, light behavior, apart from providing other measurements such as fluorescence, proportions, alignment, symmetry, and fingerprint. The GIA (Gemological Institute of America) and AGS (American Gem Society) are two of the diamond grading authorities in the US.Beware of diamond grading scams: Diamond grades can differ from one lab to another, and also from one gemologist to another. This is due to certain shortfalls of the human eye, apart from other integrity issues. Note that the price of the diamond differs based on the diamond grade. There have been many diamond grading scams because of such subjective grading practices.

Find out about what her parents value.,
Talk to your girlfriend about marriage.Ask your girlfriend if she’d like to get married.,
Evaluate when the best time for you to get married is.,
Know the answer ahead of time.When you’re ready to ask your girlfriend’s parents for her hand in marriage, you should already have some sense of what they think of you and your relationship with their daughter.",How to Ask Your Girlfriend's Parents For Their Daughter's Hand in Marriage1," Before you decide to ask your girlfriend's parents for their daughter's hand in marriage, consider what you know about them and if this is something that they will expect or even appreciate. This is an old tradition that some parents might see as essential, while others might not expect at all.


If you are unsure about whether or not your girlfriend's parents will appreciate this gesture, then try asking your girlfriend what she thinks. You could say something like, ""Are your parents pretty traditional when it comes to marriage?"" or ""How did your parents get engaged?""
Conduct research into your her parents’ values if necessary. For instance, if your girlfriend’s parents are from India, you might need to investigate Indian marriage traditions to figure out whether or not asking a girl’s parents for her hand in marriage is a standard part of the marriage process. Use internet search engines and your local library to discover more about the specific cultural norms of your girlfriend’s parents.;
, This is different than proposing to your girlfriend. Inquire generally what she imagines in your shared future. Ask, for instance, “Where do you see us in three to five years?” If she brings up marriage, you can safely proceed with the process of asking for her hand from her parents.


If she does not immediately mention marriage, ask her specifically if she’d ever like to get married to you. For instance, you might ask, “Do you think we would be happy if we were married?” If she says yes, go forward with the process of asking her parents for her hand in marriage. If she is uninterested in marriage or unsure if she wants to marry you, don’t pressure her into it.

, Is now a good time for you two to get married? Are there any reasons you shouldn't? Think about it through your girlfriend's parents' eyes: would they want their daughter marrying you? If you have only known one another for a week, you may want to hold off on proposing marriage.


It is wise to date someone for at least two to three years before deciding to marry.Think about your and your girlfriend’s financial situation. Not only will the actual wedding be very expensive (the average wedding costs over $26,000), but other things like wedding rings and the honeymoon can quickly sink your financial ship. While you will probably not get married immediately after being granted your girlfriend’s hand in marriage, you should have enough cash to cover everything when the marriage occurs (usually six to twelve months after proposing to her).

, Do they look favorably upon the relationship, or are they skeptical of it? Ask your girlfriend from time to time what they think of you. Ask her to be specific.


Does her father-in-law, for instance, have only mild reservations which would be leveled at any suitor? In this case, you can feel confident about receiving approval. On the other hand, does he have concrete, specific concerns about your ability to provide or remain committed to your girlfriend? In this case, wait until you’ve secured the trust of your girlfriend’s parents before asking them for her hand in marriage.
While it might seem like cheating, going into the situation with the answer a foregone conclusion is in fact the best way to ensure you don’t waste your time or that of your girlfriend’s parents.

Prioritize physical stores over online sellers.,
Purchase from mom-and-pop shops for better bargaining.,
Avoid designer fads and names.,
Shop around before purchasing.,
Negotiate the final cost, if appropriate.",How to Buy a Diamond Ring2," Online diamond sellers can provide a wide selection often at competitive prices. However, it's unlikely you'll be able to inspect the diamond before purchasing, which in some cases can lead to diamonds of unsuitable quality being purchased. For this reason, you should prioritize stores you can visit in person.If you do decide to go with an online diamond retailer, make sure the seller is well established and has a good reputation.
You'll also want to check that any online diamond seller you are considering sells diamonds from a certified diamond authority.
To evaluate online sellers, you may want to us a diamond report, like the Rapaport Diamond Report, the Troy Diamond Report, Ajediam Antwerp Diamonds Monthly, and the Gem Guide., Franchise diamond sellers are oftentimes held to corporate policies that make it more difficult to bargain. Smaller, family owned stores will likely be more willing to budge where price is concerned, or may throw in extras, like free polishing or a deal on insurance.

, As with most products, popular brands will likely be more expensive than others. Two diamonds could be extremely similar except for the name attached to them, and this may be the only factor making one diamond ring more expensive than another., Some stores may specialize in certain kinds of diamonds. In some cases, certain diamond rings may be one of a kind or only available at some stores and not others. To get the most extensive selection, you'll need to visit several diamond retailers.


You should also ask about the ability of a potential diamond seller to accommodate special requests. For example, you may want to use a combination of metals in the band to cut down costs. Some stores might not have the facilities to do this., As previously mentioned, franchise sellers may be held to rigid corporate policies that make it difficult to bargain, and upscale diamond sellers might consider it in poor taste. However, even stores that adhere strictly to no bargaining policies still might offer other freebies to get your sale.


If you're shopping for a diamond ring with your partner, be wary of diamond sellers trying to convince you to spend more on a ring by upselling your partner.
Stick to your budget even when a ""special"" deal is offered. Specials are often a gimmick to increase sales.
If you miss a sale, inquire if its still available after the fact. Many times these kind of sales will still be available.
Don't let an emotional or pushy salespeople deter you from asking questions or taking your time. A diamond ring is a major purchase, and you should take your time so you end up with the right ring for you."
"
Set a budget.,
Discuss expectations with the recipient.,
Account for style.,
Utilize style trends while determining the best ring.,
Inquire about the diamond setting.,
Purchase your diamond ring.",How to Buy a Diamond Ring3," There is a general expectation that when buying an engagement ring you should spend about three months of your salary on it. You shouldn't feel obligated to do this, as this idea came about as a result of a diamond seller's marketing campaign.In some cases, a less expensive diamond may suit you and your partner's sense of style and financial situation better.
Having a firm price range will help prevent you from being upsold when purchasing your diamond. Diamond merchants are salespeople, and will try their hardest to get you to buy the most expensive diamond.

, If you're planning on surprising your partner with a diamond ring and a proposal, this may not be feasible. Still, you can bring up the topic as a ""what if"" situation, or you can get your partner on the topic by asking them their opinion on the rings of married friends and relatives.


A diamond ring is a significant investment and symbolizes a lasting commitment. Some diamond sellers have a limited return policy in case your partner doesn't like the ring you've chosen, but you should be sure to ask the seller about this if the ring is a surprise., You may notice that your partner prefers jewelry or accents that are gold in color. In this case, you may want to consider a gold band for your diamond ring. Similarly, if they prefer large, ornamental pieces, you may want to select a stone or setting that is more ornamental.


If you don't have the keenest understanding of your partner's fashion sense, you might want to ask family or a trustworthy friend what kind of diamond or setting you think might be best., There are many different variations of stone and setting, and this can make your buying the perfect diamond ring difficult. Current trends usually feature whimsical, organic, and vintage designs, like celestial, floral, and scrollwork inspired motifs. You might choose diamonds or settings in the shape of:


The stars and moon
An astrological sign
The shape of a favorite animal
Elegant and sweeping architecturally inspired designs, You may want a specific kind of setting for your stone, like one made of silver or gold. Depending on the facilities of the establishment selling you your diamond ring, they may or may not be able to provide you with the kind of setting you desire.


Just because a diamond retailer can't provide you with a setting doesn't always mean you have to go with a different seller. Ask how the seller can help you get the kind of setting you want., If you have enough money saved, you may want to pay the entire cost outright, but since diamond rings can be so expensive, some sellers may offer payment options. Inquire with your diamond seller to find out if these payment options are available to you.

Identify why you’re going to ask your girlfriend’s parents for her hand in marriage.Before going forward with the process -- which can be difficult under some circumstances -- you should know the consequences of a “yes” or “no” answer from you girlfriend’s parents.,
Meet your girlfriend’s parents before asking.You should be comfortable around your girlfriend’s parents before asking them for permission to marry.,
Arrange a meeting with her parents.When presenting them with news that their daughter might get married, it is important to meet them face-to-face.,
Choose the location in which to meet her parents.You could choose to sit down with your girlfriend’s parents at their home, or you might choose to have a nice meal with them.",How to Ask Your Girlfriend's Parents For Their Daughter's Hand in Marriage2," There are two conditions under which you’d ask for your girlfriend’s parents to marry:


You might be asking for permission to marry. In other words, if your girlfriend’s parents say no to the marriage, she will obey their wishes and reject any marriage offer from you.
You might be asking for your girlfriend’s parents approval. This is distinct from the request for permission. Asking for approval of the marriage means that they support the marriage of you and your girlfriend. If denied, your girlfriend may or may not accept a marriage proposal. Even if she remains open to the possibility of marriage, you might not want to go forward with the process. If you do end up getting married, prepare for some awkward family get-togethers at the very least.

, They, likewise, will feel more comfortable granting approval to the marriage if you are not meeting them for the first time when asking their permission to marry their daughter.


If you have not had the opportunity to meet your girlfriend’s parents before deciding to ask them for her hand in marriage, wait until after you have to ask for their permission to marry.

, This demonstrates that you take seriously the notion of marriage and the proposal process. Ask them to meet you for a brief afternoon outing.


If they ask why you want to get together, then you could say something like, ""I have something important that I want to talk to you about.""
Do not call your girlfriend’s parents on the phone to express your intentions for marriage or ask them for permission over the phone, unless you have no other option. Asking in person is the best option.
Do not send an email or a letter asking her parents to grant permission to marry.

, Think about what her parents are like. Would they like to go to a simple eatery? A fine restaurant? Would they want to have a conversation about at the bowling alley or on the golf green?


If your girlfriend’s parents live far away, finding the right location to meet them can be difficult. In fact, however, the apparent challenge distance presents is actually an opportunity. Traveling a great distance with the specific intention of acquiring their approval for your marriage proposal signals to them that you are fully committed to marrying their daughter and will go to great lengths to do so.
In the case of parents who live a distance away, you could also consider timing the question with a family visit you and you girlfriend make together. In this case, just take your girlfriend’s parents aside privately before leaving them.

Plan what you're going to say.,
Consult your girlfriend’s primary parent.If your girlfriend was raised by both parents, you should sit down with both of them.,
Begin by expressing how you feel for their daughter.Be honest and sincere when offering your feelings.,
Explain why you want to marry their daughter.You have, in part, already done this by describing all the good qualities you see in their daughter.,
Prepare to answer questions.After they’ve granted permission for the marriage, your future parents-in-law will have some obvious questions for you.",How to Ask Your Girlfriend's Parents For Their Daughter's Hand in Marriage3," Asking your girlfriend’s parents for her hand in marriage can be nerve-wracking. If you are very nervous or afraid that you’ll forget what you want to say to her parents, it would be helpful to memorize and practice the speech beforehand. If you want a more natural conversation, or feel comfortable asking for your girlfriend’s hand in marriage, don’t prepare a speech. Whatever you do, try not to overthink it.


If you prepare a speech, practice reading it to a close friend.Solicit feedback to help you figure out how to best phrase what you want to say.

, In the case of divorced parents, however, consult only your girlfriend’s primary parent. For instance, if your girlfriend grew up with her mom and rarely or never saw her father, do not feel obligated to ask him for his daughter’s hand in marriage. After her mother has agreed to the marriage, inform her father that you’ve asked for his daughter’s hand in marriage.

, For instance, you might say, “She’s a wonderful woman who inspires me to be the best person I can be. She makes me laugh and always understands what I’m thinking.”


Think about why you love your girlfriend when crafting your explanation.
Don’t exaggerate or say vague things like, “She’s perfect,” or “We never have any problems.” Conclude by informing them that they’ve raised a wonderful daughter.

, But in order to justify marriage, you have to express your undying commitment to their daughter. Tell them that you want to spend your life with her.


Say, “I pledge my whole heart to your daughter and will do everything in my power to provide for her the best life I can.” Then take a deep breath and ask directly, “I would like your approval to marry (your girlfriend’s name).”
Do not say, ""I would like to marry your daughter.” A comedic parent might ruin the solemnity of the moment by asking “Which one?” if they have multiple daughters.

, They will likely want to know when you intend to pop the question on your girlfriend, and when you plan on having the wedding. They might have more practical concerns, too, like where you intend to live together or what your job will be (if you expect to change it). Listen carefully to what they have to say and don’t be afraid to say that you don’t have those answers yet. Don’t make up answers in order to appear as if you have everything all planned out when you don’t.

Avoid sterling silver if you want a durable wedding band., Talk with your jeweler about the wedding band's warranty, and ask them questions about their specific policy.

If you find out for certain that your partner is planning to propose, you can take two approaches. You can address the situation up-front and tell your partner that you know, or you can wait for the proposal and do your best to act surprised. Consider which scenario will work best within your relationship dynamic.;
, If you know that your significant other is planning to propose, try to keep it to yourself. Restrain your excitement; don't tell your friends, your parents, or even strangers. Nothing is certain. You might be embarrassed or disappointed if you build the situation up in your head.

, Think about your life, career, and relationship goals; your maturity level and your personal finances; your significant other. Ask yourself whether getting married is the right choice for you right now. If you say yes, you should do so wholeheartedly, without any doubts. Explore your misgivings, if you have any, and determine how valid they are.Search your soul. Make a list of pros and cons, or journal your thoughts, or speak with a trusted confidante. It is perfectly reasonable to do a bit of soul-searching before making such a huge decision.
If you find yourself uncertain, do not feel pressured to accept the proposal. You can always ask your partner to give you time. You can keep the relationship in your life without committing to a marriage just yet. You don't need to do anything that makes you uncomfortable.

, It is easy to block out the words and start listening to the voices in your head. However, it may be wise to pay attention to exactly what your partner is saying. Consider the implications of his or her words. When all is said and done, consider your feelings on the topic: even if you've already thought it through, ask yourself in the moment whether you are ready to marry this person. Feelings can change when you confront the reality of a situation.Don't take too long. It's good to stay in touch with your feelings, but you might offend your partner if you keep him/her waiting.

, Be genuine and straightforward. Make it clear that you are accepting. If you hesitate or joke about the situation, you may hurt or confuse your significant other. Let yourself be swept up in the moment. Let it be special! It may feel more authentic if you don't plan your reaction.Let your emotions show how excited you are about marrying him/her. Say, ""Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!"" or ""Oh my gosh – of course I'll marry you!""
If your partner set up a special proposal (e.g. something with a theme, or something that plays on an inside joke between the two of you), consider responding in line with that theme. Have fun with it.
Starting with things like ""Oh, Sam..."" may throw your partner off balance. Unclear words can confuse the proposer. You may need to repeat your answer – it's easy for the proposer miss your words in his/her haste. Repetition also affirms your answer and makes it feel more real.

, Thinking about this kind of commitment might make you feel excited, peaceful, or anxious. Whatever you are feeling, feel free to express it to your significant other. If you want to build a life with this person, you should share your emotions! There are times when it's better to play it cool, but accepting a proposal is not one of those times.

, Place your hand on your partner's hand, and show some affection toward him/her. This small gesture will show some support and give your partner a sense of closure. Don't be afraid to show your excitement with your gestures. Hug him; kiss him; throw yourself into his arms. Make the moment special!

, This is a classic marriage tradition in many Western cultures. The proposer gets down on one knee and opens the ring box to ""pop the question""; the fiancee-to-be blushes, gets excited, says ""Yes!""; and the ring slides onto the finger to symbolically seal the deal. You don't need to do this right away, and you can let the proposer take the lead – but it wouldn't hurt to hold out your left hand to make it easier.If the ring does not slide on easily, you may have to help your new fiancee put it on.
If the ring turns out to be the wrong size, accept the situation gracefully. Your fiancee will probably be rather embarrassed, so just act natural. You can always take the ring to a jeweler to be re-fitted; but you cannot redo this magical moment. Focus on how excited you are to be engaged!

, Now is the time to get excited! Tell all of your friends and family, if that's your thing – or simply pass the news along as it comes up. Consider posting a status or photo to social media. This can be an efficient and appreciative way to spread the word to most of the important people in your life.


Consider your partner's comfort level, and consider the complexities of the situation. If you aren't supposed to be getting married (due to parents, religion, etc.), then it may not be wise to publicize the proposal just yet. On the other hand, if you have nothing to hide, a loving and joyful Facebook post might make your partner feel even more appreciated.

, Make sure that you both understand what this means. You have committed to marrying this person, and to sharing a life together – so it's important to be on the same page. If you have any special considerations, make them clear early on. Make the engagement a collaborative process so that no one gets hurt., Now that you're engaged, you have a wedding to look forward to! Collaborate with your partner, and make sure that you're both on the same page. You can plan a lavish wedding and invite all of your friends and family, or you can spring for a private, intimate wedding. Set a date and get planning – or simply head down to the courthouse!

",How to Buy an Engagement Ring," Knowing the styles of engagement rings she prefers will help you narrow down the vast list of possibilities.


If you want the engagement to be a surprise, pay attention to her comments on rings she sees or when other friends get engaged.
Ask her friends if you’re not sure. They will often know the styles she likes or exactly what she wants.
If the engagement isn’t a surprise, then ask your future fiancée what kind of ring she would like.
Shop together and have her pick out several styles she likes. This way, you can surprise her with the final choice.;
, Finding out your intended fiancée’s ring size assures that the day you propose you have the perfect ring for her finger.


People often don’t know their ring sizes. Take a ring she wears frequently and have it measured. Just make sure she doesn’t notice! A good way to do this quickly is to trace her ring on a piece of paper and then put the ring back. Many jewelers can estimate her ring size from your sketch.Some people prefer their rings to fit a little bit looser to accommodate for swelling.
You can have the size increased or decreased as needed once you purchase the engagement ring.

, Knowing how much money you can spend on a ring is important. You want to get your fiancée the perfect ring without going into major debt.The old rule of thumb on ring prices is you should spend 2-3 months’ salary.Be realistic about what you can actually afford. For example, it might only be 4-6 weeks pay.
If you know your budget before you research and buy, you can make adjustments to certain aspects of the ring like cut and color. This ensures that you get the best possible quality and value for your money., Buying an engagement ring isn’t as simple a task as going to a store and picking out something. Armed with your fiancée's preferences and a little information about the different components of engagement rings, you can easily make the right choice.


Any ring is made up of two parts, the setting and the stone. There are countless combinations of metals, stones, shapes, and cuts you can combine for your fiancée’s perfect engagement ring., The setting is ring’s metal framework and enhances the beauty of a stone.


Settings are normally in the following metals: gold (which comes in yellow, white, or rose), platinum, or palladium. Silver is also an option. Platinum is hypoallergenic and an excellent choice for someone with sensitive skin., Once you’ve decided on a what metal you would like for the setting, you can figure out what style setting you’d like. There are many options such as vintage, pavé, bezel, or channel set.You can also choose a setting after you’ve chosen your stone. Often, the brilliance of a stone is influenced by the setting’s metal. For example, colorless diamonds look best in white gold or platinum because yellow gold casts slight yellow tint onto a clear stone.Two other options are custom settings and vintage or heirloom rings.
Jewelers can craft custom engagement rings that specifically fit your fiancée’s personality, taste, and size. A jeweler will let you choose the setting, setting style and a stone or stones you like.
You can buy quality vintage or heirloom rings from jewelers, or even from websites like Ebay. Estate sales are another place to find vintage or heirloom pieces.

, This is arguably the most difficult part of buying an engagement ring because a stone has so many variables. The stone is what is placed into a setting and is the central focus of any engagement ring. The 4C’s- cut, clarity, color, and carats (or stone size)- are the characteristics of a stone and dictate its price.


If you are socially conscious, you may want to consider purchasing a “conflict free diamond,” which are stones that have not funded civil war or human rights abuses in African combat zones., Traditionally, engagement rings are clear diamonds. Colorless, round, brilliant cut diamonds are still the most popular for engagement rings.People are increasingly adding other gemstones, such as sapphires, emeralds, or rubies to their engagement rings, either as the center stone or to frame the center stone.
Fancy colored diamonds in yellow, pink, or blue are also popular- and expensive because of their rarity.Colors are rated on a scale of colorless (D grade) to light tint (N-Z grades).Aim to purchase color grade “H” and above so that the stone doesn’t have too much of a yellow tint., This refers to the stone’s shape, which is cut by a qualified jeweler.


Cut is considered the most important factor for beauty. A poor cut can make the stone look dull.Some examples of different cuts include: round, princess, emerald, and radiant. Cushion and Asscher cuts are considered “fancy” and are generally more expensive.Aim to purchase cut grade “very good” or above, which will guarantee your stone sparkles brilliantly., Carats refer the size of a stone. The more carats a stone has, the larger its surface area. Ring prices increase with carat weight.


Each carat is divided into 100 points: if you have a one carat ring with 50 points, it is equal to 1.5 carats.If your fiancée wants a higher carat weight ring and cost is an issue, one tip is to get a stone with a larger surface area and shallower cut. This way, you’ll get the size without a significant increase in price., A stone’s clarity measures imperfections, also called inclusions. The less inclusions a ring has, the more it will sparkle- and cost.


Clarity is graded on a scale from “FL” (flawless) to “SI” (some inclusions” to “I” (imperfect).Grades “VS” (very small inclusions) and “SI” (small inclusions) are considered “fine quality” stones., There are countless engagement rings for sale and you want to make sure that you find the right ring for your fiancée by exploring what styles are available at different vendors.


Give yourself time to find the perfect ring. Don’t buy the first ring you find- you can always come back to any ring after searching around a bit.

, Shop around to get a sense of what stores offer in terms of engagement rings and factors like their insurance and return policies.


It’s important to find a reliable location to buy your engagement ring. This will guarantee the quality of your purchase.
Ask for recommendations for jewelers from friends or family.
Big name chain stores like Tiffany, Cartier, or Macy’s are also safe locations to purchase a high-quality ring.The Gemological Institute of American can also suggest quality vendors., Once you’ve done your research and decided on the perfect ring, you’re ready to purchase it for her.

, There are a few questions you should ask when you purchase your ring about its quality, insurance, and pricing.


Ask whether the diamond comes with a diamond certificate. All quality stones come with a “diamond certificate” that contains information on the stone’s cut, carats, and clarity.
Ask whether or not you can purchase insurance for the ring. This is an excellent option if your fiancée loses the ring or it’s stolen. The store also may have a replacement policy if stones fall out of loose settings.
Ask about the return policy. You’ll want the option to return the engagement ring if you fiancée doesn’t like it or if the engagement breaks.
Ask about financing. If you don’t have the entire amount to cover the ring, ask if the company will finance the cost of the ring over a set period of time.

Pay attention to your family member's needs.,
Provide need-based assistance.,
Respond to a request for help or support appropriately.,
Help your relative acquire any special equipment or resources they might need.,
Demonstrate love and compassion.,
Plan family events thoughtfully.",How to Support a Family Member with a Disability1," Whether you live with the person you’re helping or if you just visit them from time to time, keep an eye on them to see if they need or want physical or emotional assistance. After all, if you don’t know what’s going on with your family member, you won’t be able to help them.


If the person lives with you, watch them to see if they need help.
If you don’t live with the person, you should call or contact them regularly to see if they’re okay and if they need help.
Always make sure to respect your family member’s privacy and personal space.How closely they need to be monitored depends on their age, needs, and amount of care received from other people. For example, a young, nonverbal autistic child will need more help than a fully verbal, semi-independent autistic adult.;
, Depending on the specific disability, you can support your family member by offering assistance. Assistance can come in the form of physical help, emotional support, or short-term/long-term planning.


Tailor your help to the needs you observe or hear about. For example, if your relative uses a wheelchair and has good hand strength, it would be appropriate to ask if they'd like you to move a chair out of their way, but it wouldn't be appropriate to offer to cut up their food. If they say they can do it, let them do it, and don't insist on ""helping.""
If offering emotional support, think about spending time doing activities your relative enjoys., A very important part of providing help to a family member with a disability is the way you respond to requests for help from that person. This is important, because if you don’t respond in an appropriate way, that person won’t feel comfortable asking for help or confiding in you.


If your relative asks for help with a specific activity, try to help them as soon as you can. Try not to put it off so long that the person no longer needs your help.
Always be polite and gracious when the person asks for assistance. Avoid saying things like “I’m sort of busy, but I can help.” You don't want them to feel bad for having a disability. Instead, just say, ""Sure, what can I do?""
Make sure you are pleasant and seem enthusiastic when you are helping or talking to your relative. Ultimately, if your relative feels like they are putting you out, they won’t want your support.Keep in mind that it may be difficult and take a lot for them to ask for help.

, Your relative might need disability-related resources that they don’t already have. In this case, you should do what you can to help them get the equipment or resources.


Consider applying for grants for resources or equipment for your relative.
See if your relative is eligible for benefits under Medicare, Medicaid, their health insurance, or other similar parties.
If your relative is a veteran, they might be eligible for equipment or resources from the Veterans Administration. Help them navigate the bureaucracy of the VA to get their benefits.
Don’t feel obligated to spend money you don’t have., Ultimately, one of the most important things you’ll need to do when helping a family member with a disability is to show that you love and care about them. Without showing love and compassion, your family member may feel uncomfortable or unhappy.


Try to do little things from time to time that might go above and beyond just help or emotional support. If you help a person who is immobile get food or go to the doctors, perhaps think about bringing them to their favorite restaurant or bringing them takeout.
Always accept them for who they are. Don’t dismiss them and don’t dislike them because of their disability. Try to view your relative as just another person with particular needs or challenges., One of the best ways to support your disabled relative is to plan family events thoughtfully. Whenever you plan an event, make sure to consider you relative's disability. Ultimately, you want them to be able to participate in family events just like everyone else.


Consult with your relative or their primary caregiver about what locations work the best or locations that the disabled relative enjoys visiting.
Be thoughtful when planning the time of the event. If your relative is best able to enjoy and participate in family activities in the morning or in the afternoon, plan for that time of day. If they have doctors appointments, plan around those appointments.
Pick activities that your family member can most participate. If they are hard of hearing, avoid noisy restaurants. If they are immobile, pick an activity that does not require much mobility."

Write a letter to a family member.,
Try to have fun.",How to Survive Being Grounded1," By grounding you, your parents want you to know that your behavior is not acceptable. Take responsibility for how you acted and apologize for this behavior. Write a sincere letter that explains your actions and apologizes for disappointing your parents.


Include what you have learned from the situation, and how you would act differently the next time.;
, Take this time to catch up on homework or to get ahead with school assignments. Don’t treat being grounded as a step backward. Instead, keep moving forward by completing tasks that you might not have enough time to do.

, Reading is an enjoyable and relaxing activity, and most parents love to see their kids bury their noses in a book. Use this time to learn something new or read an old favorite., Now is a good time to work on that model or sewing project. Having some dedicated time when you would normally be with friends can give you a little peace of mind to concentrate on a creative project. You can even use these projects as gifts for family or friends.

, You might feel that your parents are being unfair by grounding you. Writing your feelings in a journal can be a good outlet for your feelings. You can keep your journal private and write whatever you want in it. Tear up the pages after writing if you want.


You can also write a short story or do some other creative writing like poetry or a graphic novel.

, See if you can go for a run or a bike ride. Ask if your parent wants to come along with you. Exercise can be a great way to blow off steam. It can also be a great way to bond with your parent, especially when you’re not getting along.

Research your family member’s condition.,
Cultivate your patience.,
Evaluate what sort of support you can offer.",How to Support a Family Member with a Disability2," Because there are so many types of disabilities, you’ll have to put a bit of effort into researching your family member’s condition so you know what you need to do to help them. While spending time learning about the disability might seem like work, it will pay dividends in the future because you’ll have a much better understanding of your relative’s needs and the challenges that they face on a daily basis.


Disabilities can be physical. The main type of disability people think of when they think of people with disabilities are physical disabilities that restrict mobility.
Disabilities can be emotional or psychological. An increasing number of people are being diagnosed with emotional or psychological disabilities. One common psychological disability is post-traumatic stress disorder.
Disabilities can be developmental. Many people also experience learning disabilities. People with learning disabilities might require tutoring or extra help when it comes to making life choices or even choices on a daily basis., Ultimately, for many people who help relatives with disabilities, patience is an important virtue. Patience is necessary when dealing with many types of disabilities. This is important, because some people with disabilities (like everyone else) might not always acknowledge how much your support means to them.


Avoid thinking about time constraints when you are helping or supporting someone with a disability.
If you’re feeling really frustrated, chances are that the disabled person is frustrated too. You might be dealing with this when you're with them, but they have to handle it for their entire lives.

, While you may want to offer physical, financial, or emotional support, the amount of help you can offer your relative may be limited. This is why it is important to prepare to help your relative by evaluating what you can actually offer. Make sure to consider:


Your financial limitations.
Time constraints and other obligations, like work or caring for young children.
If you can’t offer time, you may be able to offer financial help. If you can’t offer financial help, you may be able to offer time. If you can't offer either, maybe you can simply check in on your relative from time to time and spend a few minutes on the phone with them.

Ask your family member if they need support.,
Listen to the person.,
Coordinate with other family members.",How to Support a Family Member with a Disability3," Instead of offering unsolicited assistance, you should ask your family member if they want physical or emotional support. Asking if they need and want you involved will enable you to provide help without being presumptuous and without your relative having to request help.


Say something like ""If you ever need help, you can count on me,"" or ""If you ever need someone to talk to, please call me.""
Offer both general and specific help. Sometimes people may be shy about asking for help, or might not know where to start. It can help to offer ""Would you like me to guide you to the restroom?"" or, ""What if I came over at 6:00 with some gluten-free lasagna?""
Asking your family member if they need support will allow you to initiate a conversation about their disability without you indirectly telling them that they need help., When communicating with a person about their disability, the most important thing is to listen to them. Without listening, you won’t understand their challenges and concerns. Ultimately, listening to the person you are helping will enable you to provide help that is truly needed and appreciated.


Listening to a person and allowing them to give feedback will validate their personhood.
When listening to your family member, avoid thinking about what you are going to say next. Try to truly clear your mind. Focus on listening.
Wait until your relative is finished to respond. Allow them the full opportunity to talk., Another great way to support your disabled family member is to make sure that the rest of your family is on board with your plan. In order to do this, you should communicate with other family members and coordinate events and care to better support your disabled relative.


If you're not the primary caregiver, make sure to stay in regular contact with the caregiver. The primary caregiver is probably the person who knows the needs and challenges of the disabled person best (next to the disabled person).
If your disabled family member requires substantial amount of financial support, talk to your other family members about setting up a pool to share the cost of their expenses.
If your disabled family member needs emotional support and companionship, talk to your family to make sure someone is always available to offer support."

Above all, don’t start yelling and name-calling. Demonstrate how you can be calm and respectful.Your parents want to see a good attitude from you. It can be hard to do this when you’re grounded, but you will find that there will be times throughout your life when you need to control your temper and be respectful, even when you don’t feel like it. Use this as a chance to prove your maturity to your parents.

, Your parents might tell you to do extra chores along with your regular chores. Do these without grumbling or whining about them. Tell your parents when you have finished a chore so they can check your work., If you see something that needs to be done, do these without being told to do them. If you see fingerprints on the front window, then get some glass cleaner and a paper towel, and go to work cleaning the window.


Some chores can be a good way to get out of the house for a few minutes. Offering to walk the dog or taking your little sister to the park might give you a chance to get some fresh air and a change of scenery.

, Ask to have a calm, sit-down conversation with your parents so that you can talk about why you were grounded. Make sure you are not just focusing on your opinions.

You can be honest with friends about why you’re grounded, but don’t use this as a time to gripe too much about your parents.

, Talk about how good it has been to get some “me” time. Talk about being grounded in a positive way by telling your friends that you got to do enjoyable solo activities that you don’t normally have time for.

, Your friends may have done something fun without you, but this won’t be your only chance to do something fun. Make plans to do a similar activity. Be sure to get your parents’ permission for this activity.

, If you’ve been grounded for something, don’t do it again. Show your parents that you learned your lesson and that you’ve grown from the experience.

, Go the extra step of avoiding past mistakes by doing the opposite. For example, if you were grounded because you were out past your curfew, make sure that you arrive home before your curfew for the first month after you’re finished with your punishment. If you got caught smoking, sign up for a cancer awareness 5K run. Show respect to your parents by being considerate, aware and responsible.

, If you would like to be able to do more things, you can offer to pay for them. If you have a part time job – even babysitting or dog-walking – you can demonstrate that you can handle more responsibility. Your parents will be impressed by your initiative and maturity, so long as you keep the job.

, Responsible people are able to compromise and they don’t throw a fit when they don’t get their way. Be content with what you’ve got and be prepared to give a little to get a little."

, A support group can be a huge source of comfort and support during IVF. A support group can help you connect with other people who are enduring similar problems. Support groups are a good place to exchange support and advice and meet other people going through similar challenges.Ask your medical doctor or therapist for a referral.


Find a local support group or join an online support network.

, One way to reduce anxiety is to practice relaxation. You can practice relaxation right before a nerve-wracking event, during the event, or use relaxation every day as a way to prevent anxiety and cope with stress regularly. Relaxation is a great way to handle stress and anxiety.Practice visualizing a calm and peaceful place by making it come to life. Listen to the sounds, see the sights, and imagine being at this serene location. You may choose a wooded forest, a deserted beach, or the top of a mountain. Feel the temperature, imagine the wind against your body, and look around for any animals present.

Practice progressive muscle relaxation. Lie down and get comfortable. Tense the muscles in your left toes, then relax. Do the same for your right toes, then move onto each of your feet. One muscle group at a time, work up your body, tensing and relaxing., Focusing on your breath is a great way to reduce anxiety. If you are feeling anxious during a procedure or in anticipation of a situation, redirect your thoughts to your breath. You may want to spend a few moments preparing for your procedure by focusing on your breathing. You can do breathing exercises alone or with other people around; it’s unlikely other people will notice.


To practice deep breathing, slowly breathe in through your nose, then hold it for two seconds. Gently exhale through your mouth. While breathing, make sure your breathe through your diaphragm, which means your belly should move and not your shoulders. Pause between each breath cycle. Do this exercise a few times until you begin to feel calm.You can also check out How to Do Breathing Exercises for more tips and information.

, Because IVF is an ongoing process, it can be beneficial to engage in a regular practice that encourages you to be calm and relaxed. Both yoga and tai chi are daily activities that can help move your body and release stress. Connecting your mind and body can help you ease your stress.It’s best to do these activities regularly and use them to combat and prevent stress and anxiety.

, Meditation can help with worry, anxiety, and stress by refocusing the brain and turning down the worries.While many people associate meditation with religion or spiritual practices, there’s no need to focus on anything other than your own calm thoughts and feelings. Mindfulness meditation is a way to focus on tuning into specific things in order to bring awareness.When your mind is racing a million miles per minute on procedures and outcomes, slow down and spend a few moments in meditation.


For example, focus your attention solely on your breath. You can also focus on your senses: your sense of hearing, touch, taste, or vision.

, Women and men can experience depression differently. Women may tend to blame themselves, feel anxious, avoid conflicts, set poor boundaries, and turn to food for comfort.Some other common symptoms of depression include changes in appetite and sleeping, fatigue and low energy, feeling hopeless, and a loss of interest in pleasurable activities.


For more information on a diagnosis of depression, check out How to Know if You Have Depression.

, Don’t let your existence melt into IVF. Allow yourself regular social contact with your loved ones and close friends. Being with friends is a great way to buffer feelings of depression and cope with depression symptoms. Even if you’re not in the mood to go out or meet with friends, do it anyway. It may feel more comfortable at the time to retreat and isolate yourself, however, being around other people is healthier when dealing with depression.Schedule regular phone calls with family or weekly get-togethers with friends. Surrounding yourself in friendship can help lift the feelings of depression.

, One way to beat depression is to remove the focus on yourself for a little while and place it on someone else. Volunteering is an excellent way to connect to your community, combat stress and depression, increase happiness, and give you a sense of purpose. Especially during IVF, much of your focus is on you, your body, what could go wrong, waiting for results, and hoping things work out. Re-focus your attention one day a week on people in your community and feel good about the work you’re doing.You may wish to work with children, such as working as a mentor for an after-school program or in a crisis nursery. You can also volunteer at an animal shelter, homeless shelter, or elderly home.
Check out How to Volunteer for more information.

, Some studies show that acupuncture can help with symptoms of depression.Acupuncture involves placing tiny, painless needles in specific points in your body for therapeutic purposes. It’s a safe and non-prescription way to target symptoms of depression that will not affect IVF treatments, fertility, or pregnancy.


Acupuncture may even help boost fertility."

Respond diplomatically.,
Know when to let it go.,
Change the topic if the conversation is not going well.,
Find the humor.,
Practice compassion.,
Set boundaries.",How to Stay in Contact with Judgmental Family As an Adult1," When your relative begins to talk about what they don’t like about you, try not to react defensively. Getting upset with them will only add fuel to the fire and make the situation worse. Instead, stay calm and end the conversation respectfully.


For instance, if the relative says something rude about your love life, say “I am happy with how it’s going, but thank you,” and then walk away. Ending the conversation by acknowledging what they’ve said, but leaving in a polite way, may prevent any hard feelings and may even stop the relative from bringing the topic up again.;
, Striking back may be your first instinct, but take a look at the bigger picture before you respond. Ask yourself if fighting back is worth the time, emotional energy, and backlash you may receive. You don’t have to react to everything that is said; it may be wise to save your strength to fight back against something that really matters to you., You may not be able to get a judgmental or critical person to see outside of their own point of view, but it is possible. In some cases, it is better to just change the topic because attempting to explain yourself or change the way they feel may leave you defeated and depleted. Pay attention to how the conversation is going and redirect the conversation if things start to get rocky.


For example, if your family doesn’t agree with the way you raise your children and you can tell the conversation is beginning to head that way, then you have the option to shut it down immediately. Instead of discussing what they have said to you, ask them a question about something they will enjoy talking about. This can get them off of your back and help the conversation to become positive., Laughter is the best medicine and can prove to be extremely helpful in this situation. The next time your family member berates you, find the humor in how their opinion is so wrong and so off-base from reality. Simply smile, shake your head and laugh knowing that what they say isn’t true and is actually quite comical.However, make sure not to do this in their presence because this could offend the person.

, Although it may sound counterintuitive to show compassion to someone who is negative towards you, it may make both of you feel better. Take a look at their lives and you may understand why they are the way they are, which may ultimately make you feel sorry for them. Showing them a little kindness may spark something inside of them, which can help your relationship improve.


Even when they are being mean, try to say something nice to them. Just saying “hi” when your interaction is usually limited can make a huge difference. Buy them a present, take them out to lunch or even send a nice card or flowers. Making the effort to rise above the situation and acknowledging that you are still human and family may be just what the critical person needs to become happy and find peace., Families are often so immersed in each other’s lives that it is easy to cross the line. Setting up boundaries, however, can prevent them from becoming too involved and potentially hurtful. Instilling rules for them—and yourself—and then sticking to them is extremely important in keeping negativity out of your life.


Tell your family members what they are and aren’t allowed to talk to you about. For instance, if the subject of your ex-spouse is off limits, let them know in a kind way. You could say, “I appreciate you looking out for me when it comes to my ex, but I don’t want to talk about it and won’t.”
Don’t waver or give in even just once, because doing so creates an invitation for them to break through the barriers that you worked so hard to hold up."

Plan visits when you're in good spirits.,
Arrange alternative accommodations.,
Bring a source of support.,
Limit contact, if all else fails.",How to Stay in Contact with Judgmental Family As an Adult2," If being around your family for even a short time tends to bring out the worst in all of you, it can help to be sure you visit when you are in a bright mood. Seeing them when you're already feeling down or angry will only heighten the negative energy.


Avoid visits when you are extremely tired or fatigued as you are more likely to succumb to provocations and end up insulting or arguing with judgmental family. Also, avoid seeing your family when you are sad, angry, or disappointed. These are all times when visiting will simply make matters worse.

, You can manage your visits with judgmental family by not staying at the home front. Instead of bunking with relatives, stay with a close friend in the area or splurge on a hotel room if you can afford it.


Just knowing that you can ""escape"" to a blissful place after a family visit can help you stomach your aunt's judgmental questions about your dating life. Plus, limiting your time with alternate accommodations gives you moments to relieve tension in between stressful visits., Sometimes, having a familiar, smiling face to serve as a buffer can help you get through meetings with toxic family. If you have a partner, coworker, or friend who is available, ask them to join you for the trip. This gives you added motive to arrange extra accommodations. It also gives you someone level-headed to talk or vent to when you've had enough.Offer to foot the bill on the hotel or buy a lunch in exchange for their company. Your friend will likely appreciate the free trip and be glad for the invite.

, Although you want to maintain contact with your family, doing so just may not be healthy for you. Keeping away, even for the time being, may be just what you both need to gain perspective and realize that the criticism isn’t worth it. You can always become close again if you feel comfortable with it.


Begin distancing yourself by reducing the amount of phone calls, texts and emails you engage in. When you do talk, keep things brief and impersonal. Although this may be difficult, you could find that the other person takes the hint and changes their ways. If not, you will likely find that your life becomes better without all of the criticism."

Address why it hurts so much.,
Find the positive in their negative.,
Tell yourself not to take it personally.,
Consider individual or family counseling.",How to Stay in Contact with Judgmental Family As an Adult3," Having a conversation with a judgmental family member can cut you to the core. Take this opportunity to figure out why it does. Examining the cause of your feelings may help you to deal with issues and emotions you didn’t know you had.


When you’re reeling with hurt, ask yourself, “Why does what this person said bother me so much? Do I think it’s true? Do I value their opinion that much?” Once you take the time to examine the reason for the hurt, you may be able to let go of it and move on., Perhaps hearing what a judgmental relative has to say bothers you so much because you know there is a grain of truth in what they have to say. Or maybe you realized you value their opinion much more than you originally thought you did. Whatever the reason, use this is a chance to better yourself.


For instance, if your relative tends to point out a character flaw you often exhibit, take time to work on that flaw and change it for the better. If what they say hurts so much because you care about what they think of you, maybe it’s time to reevaluate the relationship and what you see in that person.
Perhaps you’ll find that they aren’t who you thought they were and you’ll learn that their opinion isn’t as valuable as you once thought, which may make things easier on you., Critical people are often the way they are because they are unhappy with themselves. As such, they take their hurt out on others. After you receive a lashing from your relative because they have an issue with something you do, simply remind yourself that it’s not you, it’s them.


After you talk to the person, tell yourself, “The way they just spoke to me wasn’t appropriate, but I don’t have to take it personally. What they said isn’t true and they are simply unhappy with themselves, so they took it out on me. Don’t get down about it.” Having this little pep talk may prevent you from becoming upset and can help you to look at the bigger picture., If unresolved issues between you and family members are significantly impacting your life, it may be practical to talk to a professional. You can do this alone if you simply want to get closure about an estranged relationship, or if your family isn't willing to work on the relationship. If they are willing to attend counseling, going as a group can help improve your communication with one another."

Involve your older children in the pregnancy process.,
Remind your child that he or she was a new baby once.",How to Help Your Child Accept a New Baby1," You will have plenty of time from when you first know that a new baby is coming until the baby actually arrives, so use it to ease the transition. Try a few of the following ideas:


Explain the kinds of things that will happen before, when, and after the baby is born over and over so that your child is prepared for what can be confusing times. But leave a little room for the unexpected, e.g., a baby who has to stay in the hospital for a few days or weeks.
Avoid giving your child the idea that the baby will be ""someone to play with"" or ""your best friend"" right away - the younger your child is, the more crucial this is.
Make sure your child understands that for weeks the new baby will only sleep, eat, look around, poop, pee, and cry. Be especially clear about the crying, i.e., explicitly tell your child that some babies cry a lot and that this is NOT the older child's fault or responsibility.

Get a baby doll and have your child practice taking care of the ""baby.""
Allow your child to come with you to prenatal appointments to listen to the baby's heartbeat. Take them to an ultrasound appointment. If you have a good friendly OB, CNP, or midwife, see if he or she will let your child ""help"" in some way.
Consider allowing your older child(ren) a say in naming the baby. This can be done by providing a list of names you wouldn't mind the baby having as a first or middle name and letting them choose the ones they really like. Ask for their input in designing and putting together the nursery. If this would work for you and your family, see if your child(ren) can attend the birth itself.
Read stories to your child about new babies that provide realistic descriptions about how new babies act and positive models for how older siblings should behave. Stay away from books that paint an unrealistically rosy picture or that make ambivalent feelings seem unacceptable.
Above all, keep all of this preparation brief, light-hearted and casual. Going on and on about it will bore some children and make others feel more anxious than prepared.;
, Using age-appropriate and positive words, tell your child about his or her birth and what made it special. This will reassure your child of his or her importance to you, and help to make it clear why you're so excited about the new baby.

"
"
Keep the child's daily routines as normal as possible before, during, and after the birth.,
Figure out positive ways for your child to interact with the baby.,
Reward and reinforce behavior that's welcoming and positive, so that the child associates being a good sibling with having a happy parent and a happy family.,
As much as you possibly can, ignore or overlook behavior that's unwelcoming and negative - the very last thing you want to do is to teach your older child that your precious attention and time can be obtained just as easily by pinching the baby or by saying ""I hate the baby"" as by offering to bring the baby a clean diaper.

,
Try talking to the baby about the older child when the older child is nearby, e.g., ""Baby, look what your smart big brother did, he tied his own shoes/made his own bed/found the remote for me"" and ""Baby, when you grow up, Big Sister can show you how to play Candyland."",
Don't *always* drop what you're doing as soon as the baby cries.,
Do fun things alone with your older child, especially if you do things with just the baby.,
Do fun things as a family.",How to Help Your Child Accept a New Baby2," Try to keep a sense of normalcy so your child will not feel like the new baby is changing everything. Especially try to avoid major upheavals such as potty-training or a new childcare situation right before or after the birth.

, Your child can hold the baby (even toddlers can do this under close supervision, sitting down, with the baby on a pillow in the child's lap), sing to the new baby, try to ""teach"" the baby to smile, read to the new baby, and so on.

, For example, you can make a ""Welcome Home"" card with the child, spending quality time during the making and also making a big deal out of giving the card to both mother and baby.

,,

, Many many many times your older children will have to wait while you take care of the baby. Every once in a while, make the baby wait.

, If you're taking a mother-and-baby exercise class, for example, make a point of doing something special with your older child about equally often. This will help your child see that there's still time for just the two of you. Even a trip to the grocery story without the baby can be fun for your older child if you're not too exhausted to be nice.

, Your child will naturally resent the baby if he or she feels the baby is preventing your family from doing fun things together. Show your child that the new baby is part of the family - this is important because young children sometimes do not understand that the baby is here to stay - by planning family outings where you can bring the baby along to share in the fun.

Trust your instincts.",How to Choose an Infant Day Care," Group day care centers are state-licensed facilities that function like a school. Children of varying ages are cared for in groups in day care centers. Home care is childcare that is run out of a private home.Pros of day care centers are that they are accredited institutions, offer care for a variety of ages, are cost-effective, have longer hours (some are open for 12 hours), and have well-organized programs geared toward your infant’s development and growth. Cons of a day care center are your child’s exposure to illness increases, and they may be less flexible in terms of scheduling.Pros of home care are that there will be fewer children, so less susceptibility to illness, and more one-on-one time for your infant. Cons of home care are some providers are unlicensed and are not required to have childcare training. Therefore, home care providers are not regularly inspected for quality. Also, if the provider becomes ill, you will have to find a babysitter or take time off from work.;
, How much are you willing to pay? While you may not be able to afford the most expensive care for your infant, you do not want to pursue the cheap route, either. Choose an option where you are able to get the best care for your money.


Fees vary greatly depending on where you live. For example, the cost of childcare for an infant can range from $458 to $1,400 per month., Consider whether you would like the day care center to be close to your place of work or your home. Then, decide how far you would like the center to be from your work or home.


If you work long hours, and find yourself at work more than at home, then choose a facility that is close to your place of work. Also, try to choose a facility that is no more than 15 to 20 minutes away from your work.
If you have a flexible work schedule, and/or if you or your partner are at home often, choose a facility that is closer to home. Try to choose a facility that is no more than 10 to 15 minutes away from home.

, Some day care centers stay open for up to 12 hours, while others only stay open during regular business hours. If you work long or unconventional hours, or if you commute, choose a center that has longer hours, and one that is open during the holidays (if needed).

, When searching for the ideal center, start your search early. Try to start your search six months before you will need childcare. Some of the best centers fill up fast and have a waiting list. If you wait till the last minute, then you might be forced to make a hasty, uninformed decision.For example, if you know that you will be going right back to work once your maternity leave finishes, then start doing your research before your baby is born.
Make a list of the top five centers or home day cares.

, Contact friends, coworkers, or family members for day or home care recommendations. Personal references are some of the best, so make sure to ask them first.You can also ask your pediatrician if they recommend any facilities.
Also consider asking parents you meet at your pediatrician’s office, at the playground, or any classes you attend, like mommy-and-me classes., The Child Care Aware hotline (800-424-2246) can provide you with the phone number of your local childcare resource and referral agency. The referral agency can then refer you to licensed facilities and home day cares in your area.Also, ask for a list of accredited centers near you. Try to find centers that are approved by the NAEYC or the NAFCC., You can also visit the National Association for the Education of Young Children's (NAEYC) website at https://www.naeyc.org, or the National Association for Family Child Care's (NAFCC) website at https://www.nafcc.org for contact information and guidelines for day care centers. The NAEYC also has a database where you can search for accredited centers near you.Try searching for day care centers on Yelp. Yelp is helpful because you can read reviews written by parents who have sent their child to the center.
You can also try visiting your online Yellow Pages. It should have a list of day care centers and home care providers in your area. This is particularly helpful if you have just moved to the area.

, To avoid wasting time and energy, screen the day cares centers in your list by first calling to enquire about their costs and their hours. Enquire about their monthly cost, application fee, and if there is a waiting list. Also, ask about their weekday and weekend hours, and their hours during the holidays.If the day care center has inconvenient hours, is expensive, and the staff is not forthcoming, then cross that day care off of your list.

, Ask to see the center’s credentials and license. You can double-check the center’s accreditations by calling your local social services department. Also, see if the center is approved by the NAEYC; this is always a plus. The day care should be open about their credentials, policies, and procedures with all families, both current and prospective.Also enquire about the staff’s credentials. Ask, “What percentage of the teacher’s have an associate’s or bachelor’s degree, and have training in early childhood education (ECE)?” Also, ask what percentage of the teachers are certified by the state or have their CDA certification.Ask if the day care encourages staff development, like ongoing education, orientation for new teachers, and training for their teachers.Ask home day care providers, “Who else will be in the house while my child is cared for?” “What are the policies for personal emergencies?” “Does your insurance cover my child? “What kind of training do you have, and can I verify it?”, Ask how the center’s curriculum addresses all aspects of child development. The center should not focus on just one stage of development. Also, see if the children are given opportunities to learn and develop through exploration and play, and if teachers are able to give your child one-on-one time.


For example, ask, “Do the babies get to spend time outside?” “Is there a TV in the day care and how often is it used?” “What kind of activities will my baby engage in and are they age-appropriate?”

, The ratio the NAEYC recommends for infants is no more than eight children in a group, with two teaching staff. For toddlers, no more than 12 children in a group, with 2 teaching staff.Ask, “What is the staff-to-child ratio, and does it ever change?”
You can also ask, “Do toddlers and infants ever share a room?” If they do, ask how the teacher-to-child ratio changes, and what precautions are taken to prevent infants from playing with toys that are inappropriate for their age.

, Assess the center’s health policies by seeing if they have a clear plan for responding to sick children, i.e., how they decide whether a child needs to go home, and how you will be notified. Ask if they require their children and staff to be up-to-date with routine immunizations.Snacks and meals should be nutritious, and foods should be prepared and stored safely. You can ask, “What exactly are the children eating, and how is it prepared?”
Make sure all staff members have training in pediatric first aid.
Make sure infants are placed on their backs to sleep, and bottles are never propped.The center should have policies regarding regular hand washing and sanitization of the center’s facilities and rooms.

, Ask the center if you can have a list of former and current clients. Contact these clients to enquire about the day care’s quality and credentials. When you call you can ask, “How happy are you and your kids with the facility?” “Have you ever run into any problems with the facility, and what were they?” and “Would you recommend this facility?”


Also ask to see how the staff communicates with the parent. Do they provide weekly reports concerning the child’s progress and behavior? Are there teacher-parent meetings and conferences throughout the year?, After interviewing the center, drop by unexpectedly in order to see how the day care functions when the staff hasn’t been prepped. Observe the interactions between the staff and the children, the classroom set-up, and the children’s behavior. Ask yourself these questions as you peruse the facility:“Does the teacher-to-child ratio represent the NAEYC’s standards, and is it true to what they said?”
“Does the teaching staff engage in warm, friendly conversations with the children, and recognize children’s work and accomplishments?”
“Are the toys and activities age appropriate and well-designed?”
“Are children’s work and accomplishments proudly displayed on the walls?”

, If you are turned off by a center, even if it has high recommendations, do not feel like you have to choose that center. Remember that you have options. If you are having second thoughts about a center, schedule an interview with another center. Centers understand that you want the best care for your baby.Try to schedule a time for you and your partner to interview the center together. Consult your partner afterwards. When choosing a center, both you and your partner should feel comfortable and be in agreement about the chosen center.

Ask how you can help.,
Tell the child how they can help.,
Find a conclusion that benefits everyone.",How to Communicate Effectively With Children," Communication does not happen in half-hearted grunts or passing phrases. To truly and effectively communicate, set aside time for discussion, connection, or even just casual conversation, and watch your relationship flourish.If your family has a lot going on, set aside 1-2 nights a week for family dates, or one-on-one dates with your kids.
Choose a time that does not conflict with other obligations. Set aside time that does not have other obligations or prior plans, such as a meeting or class.;
, Your phone, computer, or television is a distraction, and will not aid you in communicating with children. When it comes time to talk, do not allow these objects in the room, or keep them turned off. Turn off your phone, power down your computer, and leave your TV behind.If you find cell phones or computers are being particularly problematic in your family’s communication attempts, set a rule to have no phones or computers out an hour before bed, or from dinner onward--then enforce the rule, and hold yourself accountable.
If the child in question is the one using the phone and not listening during class or while you are trying to talk, kindly request that the phone be put away for the next five minutes.

, Whether you are talking or listening, make eye contact. Don’t stare the child down, but make sure it is clear that the child has your full attention and awareness. Don’t glance around the room as they speak, and don’t look over their head as you speak. Hold eye contact whenever possible.Be careful of your gaze. Although you should make eye contact, do so naturally, rather than staring the child down. Blink as you normally would, and feel free to occasionally glance down to watch the child’s hands as they talk, or their mouth as it moves.
If you cannot hold eye contact, get on your knees or sit down so your eyes are on the same level. This encourages open communication and suggests you and the child are on equal footing.

, When a child talks, you may feel tempted to immediately leap to respond. Hold your tongue, instead, and wait a few minutes to process what they have said before responding. In an argument, this will help avoid impulsive language, and in a friendly discussion, this will demonstrate that you are genuinely listening to what they have to say.There is never a situation where hurrying to respond is a good idea. Take your time. Your conversations and time spent with children should not be rushed.
Keep in mind that children and teenagers are usually very good at manipulation and getting a rise out of adults.

, Stay in the present moment. Don’t allow your mind to wander while you are speaking or sitting with a child. Keep your mind and eyes focused on the task at hand. Even if you are sitting comfortably in silence, don’t let your mind travel to your to-do list--pay attention to the child’s body language, breathing patterns, and silent communication.Encourage children to practice mindfulness with you. Gently point out if a child’s attention has started to wander, or they have become less engaged. Lead by example, and teach kids how to be present.

, Although this might be met with a nonsensical gurgle from a toddler, get in the habit of asking about the child’s day. When started from a young age, a child will feel secure in knowing that they are cared for.When you ask, be prepared to listen. If you don’t have enough time to devote to the answer, wait to ask the question. If you make a habit of asking about a kid’s day, but are too busy or distracted to listen to the answer, you defeat the purpose of asking.

, Encourage your child in their hobbies, but don't force them to do things. If a toddler is interested in butterflies, suggest a trip to the library to check out a book about butterflies. If an adolescent is passionate about politics, have a small, civil debate. If a teenager is head-over-heels for playing the oboe, ask them to play a small concert for you.There is a fine line between getting involved, and being overbearing. Ask how you can get involved, and how they would like you to be involved.

, When a child speaks with you--particularly about serious things--repeat what they’ve said back to them, using your own words, and following with, “Right?” or “Do I understand?” This will not only let the child know that you are listening, but will give them a chance to clarify if you have misunderstood what they’ve said.Misunderstanding is one of the greatest pitfalls in effective communication. If you are not sure what a child means by something, take a few moments to ask and continue to practice this step until you have a clear idea of what is being said.

, Communication is a two-way street, and requires both parties to have an open mind about the other’s opinions and ideas. While you can’t enforce a child’s willingness to be open-minded, you can certainly make sure that you keep your own mind open and welcome new ideas.Being open-minded is not the same as being inconsistent or easily swayed. Being open-minded simply means listening to the opinions and views of others, and not immediately discounting them if they run counter to your own. Make sure your child's ideas and feelings are validated.
Remember that a child is a separate entity with their own feelings, ideas, and dreams, and should be treated as such.

, While communication is certainly about openness, it is also about setting limits and boundaries. Clearly identify what is and is not off-limits to children.


Children need boundaries to feel safe and secure. This is as true of an 18-month-old as it is an 18-year-old senior in high school. Setting boundaries gives children the freedom to make their own decisions without constantly needing to consult others.
Try to get your child or teen involved in setting boundaries as they are more likely to follow them this way and see that their opinions are valued.

, Children should never feel too afraid or ashamed to speak to you, so an open-door policy is the best possible policy to have. That being said, do have some caveats: although you are open to hearing whatever is going on, some behaviors and admissions may result in consequences.Some parents use a “safety circle” or other tool to encourage children to be open and honest, while keeping punishments low or nonexistent. Decide if this is the right decision for your family or situation.
You can also encourage open communication with the understanding that a fair consequence should be expected. For instance, a child may admit that they’ve broken a window with the understanding that they must contribute to the cost of repairing the window.

, A toddler might think playing with the computer cord is great fun, or an adolescent might prefer riding their bike in the street. Kindly but firmly let children know what types of behavior are not acceptable, and provide an absolute “no.”When saying “no,” remember that not every “no” is a negative answer. Instead, let children know that a “no” is like a fence or bodyguard that keeps them safe.
Be sure to teach your child that is it okay for them to say ""no"" sometimes as well.

, Do not merely toss out a “because I said so” when you are discussing boundaries and limitations with children. Even as young as infancy, explain your motives and reasons for your decisions.As you place an infant on the ground for tummy time, for instance, you can quickly say, “I am going to set you down for tummy time so you can get stronger.”
When you tell a school-age child they cannot go to a friend’s sleepover, explain that you do not know your friend’s parents, and you do not feel comfortable entrusting their safety to a stranger.
Keep in mind that you don't always have to explain yourself to your children. However, doing so now and then is a good way to model open communication.
Make sure that you do not bring yourself down to their level and be on the lookout for manipulation.
Also, make sure to pick your battles wisely. Some things are not worth fighting with your child about.

, Even if you come to the child with a clear need to speak, allow the child to say their part once you have finished, and make it clear that they should expect to hear a response (or rebuttal) once they have finished speaking.Although this is an excellent way to communicate, it serves the dual purpose of teaching children how to communicate with others. Work to model effective, civil conversation whenever possible.

, If a child comes to you with a problem or wants to do something you don’t approve of, ask how you can help, or what you can do to make it up to them. If they want to have friends over for a water balloon fight, for instance, and you don’t have the time to clean up hundreds of balloon shards, ask if there is another activity they would like, or how you can strike a compromise.Offering to alternatives is a good way to compromise and allow your child to be heard while also enforcing your own rules.
Sometimes, you will need to give a firm “no,” rather than a “no, but what about something else?” Learn to recognize the difference between something that requires an absolute no (something dangerous or impossible, for instance), and something that requires a “no, but…”

, When you set boundaries or discuss upcoming plans with a child, give them some responsibility. Explain how they can help make a new job easier for the family by cleaning the dishes several nights a week, or how important it is to treat their friends with respect when you play a new game in the classroom.Part of communication is explaining what being part of a community means, and how every community member needs to support and encourage others. Requiring a child to exercise responsibility teaches community quickly and effectively.

, Do not only think of your own welfare, and your own preferences. Include the child in your decision-making, and search for a conclusion that is not only beneficial to everyone, but also preferable to the majority.This will help to teach them empathy and out of the box thinking.


This can be practiced from toddlerhood and on. A toddler, for instance, can choose between a trip to the library and a trip to the store. An adolescent might like to choose between the beach or a camping trip for a summer vacation. A teenager might like to choose between two movies on a relaxed day in class. Teach and encourage children to make their own decisions, and to make decisions as a group.

Talk about some of the strengths associated with autism.,

Tell a non-autistic child how to respond.,
Warn a computer-savvy child not to look up autism.",How to Explain Autism to Children1," If you try to hide a child's autism or discuss it in whispers, they'll learn that it's something shameful or bad. You can mention the word ""autism"" in their presence even before they are old enough to understand. Many parents worry a child's self esteem will be harmed by being told their diagnosis. However, children will notice that they're different, and withholding the truth doesn't help them.Some children will begin asking questions earlier on than others. In general, when your child stars to ask questions, this may be a good opportunity to begin the explanation.
Usually, once an autistic child is surrounded by peers at school, they will realize that they act differently and are treated differently.They need to know why, or they might think something is wrong with them.;
, It's difficult to explain something if you don't even understand it. Do some research, so that you know the general facts and can answer simple questions. There are many great books written on autism that can help you explain the diagnosis to your child.Ask the Autistic community for reading recommendations. Search for books and essays written by autistic people as a primary source. Consider books written by non-autistic family members as a secondary source.
Some literature speaks very negatively about autism, treating autistic people as burdens upon their families. Watch your sources and use your judgment when selecting reading material.

, Your child will probably come back with more questions, and you'll have multiple opportunities to teach them. Don't feel that you need to fit all the information into one conversation. It's normal to have the conversation over a course of time.Always keep the conversation open. Remind your child that you're here if they have questions. Say something like, ""If you ever want to know more, just ask. You may be confused sometimes by why you're different from other people, and I'm always here to explain.""
In many cases, a child learns the most about autism through asking as questions arise. You may not always know the answer. You can always say ""I don't know"" and look it up or ask someone else later.

, Look for inclusive children's books and movies, especially those written by autistic people. This can be an easy and fun way to introduce the idea of diversity and acceptance. You do not want the child to see autistic differences as negative. Instead, focus how they are unique, special, and valued.Make sure the child knows that it's not bad to be disabled. Say something like ""Autism is why some things are hard for you, like loud kitchens or tying your shoes, and also why you're good at some things, like spelling and facts about cats. You're different, and that's okay.""
Remind your autistic child that they are not alone. Let them know that there are plenty of autistic children (and autistic adults) in the world. If your child is mainstreamed, make sure they have an opportunity to meet other autistic people.
Make it clear that childhood messages of ""be yourself"" also apply to autistic people, and your child shouldn't need to hide who they are. Make it clear that you're proud of your child, autism and all.

, Your attitude can help shape your child's opinions of autism. Use the same tone of voice that you'd use to explain why cars have wheels, or why you go to the grocery store every weekend. This sends the message that autism is okay, and nothing to worry much about., It's important to start with the simplest parts. Focus on what is most relevant to your child. This will depend upon the person, and if it is someone the child knows, how close they are to the child.

Explain why a sibling may behave differently. For example, say something like, ""Because your sister is autistic, sometimes she needs quiet time and gets upset when people touch her without her permission.""
Explain that autism is a brain type, not a choice or an illness. You could say ""Lucy was born non-autistic, and you were born autistic. That means you'll be different from each other, and that's okay. Some things are very hard for you, and some things are easier.""

, Metaphor can help a child developed a better understanding of autism. Think of metaphors you could use to explain to a child how their or their loved one's brain works differently.A toaster/hairdryer analogy is common in the Autistic community. For example, ""Let's say your brother's brain works like a toaster. A toaster is an important tool that achieves many vital tasks. Your brain works like a hairdryer, which is also a useful tool. However, it's very hard to make toast with a hairdryer, just as you couldn't dry hair with a toaster. Both of you have special contributions to the world. They're just very different."", Pinpoint a few strengths that the autistic person has, and explain them briefly. This lets the child know that autism isn't all bad, and that they don't need to feel sorry for the autistic person.

""Autism is also why you are so good at math, and why you have such a big imagination.""
""Alex is good with computers, and knows a lot of things about cats, because of autism. It has great parts and hard parts.""

, There's nothing ""bad"" or ""wrong"" with an autistic person, and they can be themselves just like other people do. Encourage a non-autistic child to be open-minded and accepting towards autistic people. Remind an autistic child that it's okay to struggle, and that autism doesn't make them bad.

Encourage your child to ask questions and be patient when they don't understand.

, You can let other children know how to help their loved one with autism. Briefly say what they can do to interact well and help the autistic person feel more comfortable. Offer insight into an autistic person's world to help explain.

You can say things like, ""If your friend is covering his ears, it means he needs some quiet time. You can help by giving him space and letting an adult know that he could use help.""
Also, explain any behaviors that could potentially confuse a child. For instance, ""Renisha flaps her hands when she is excited because she is autistic. It's normal for autism, and it just means she's having fun.""

, The internet is filled with negative and misleading sources such as Autism Speaks. This may lead an autistic child to feel ashamed of themselves, or for a non-autistic child to think that autistic people are a burden.

An autistic child who comes across negative attitudes about autism may start to feel low self esteem or even self hatred. You can combat this by praising the child's strengths, and teaching them that everyone is lovable and important, including autistics.

Make the ground rules clear.,
Explain differences in chores and expectations.,
Share your attention as equally as possible.,
Reassure your autistic child.,
Reassure your non-autistic children regularly.,
Find activities everyone can enjoy.",How to Explain Autism to Children2," Explain why your family might have different rules, and why they are important. Non-autistic children might not intuitively realize why some things are upsetting or painful to an autistic family member, so it's important for you to explain.

For example, ""Because Mommy is autistic, loud noises can hurt her when she is stressed. When this happens, she'll go to her room to relax. If Mommy is in her room, it's important to leave her alone, so she can feel better faster.""
Encourage all children to set boundaries like ""I don't want to be touched"" or ""I need quiet time."" It's essential for autistic children to know how to assert themselves, and non-autistic children could also benefit from this skill (and learn to take the autistic family member seriously).

, Non-autistic children may get frustrated or jealous if their autistic sibling does not have to help as much with chores. If they get upset, explain why this happens.

Emphasize that chores are based on ability, not age. It may take a lot of effort for an autistic child to do chores, so it's normal for them to have less or none at all.
Explain to your other children that therapy is work, and is different from play. For example, ""I know it looks like your sister's just playing, but it's actually quite hard for her. She's trying to learn certain skills that do not come easy to her. This is a chore for her, just like you have to clean your room. It's just different.""
Always reassure your autistic child that they are important. Remind them that being a family member isn't dependent on doing certain things, and that the child contributes in their own, important way.

, This can be difficult sometimes. Autistic children may often need special attention. Make sure to share your time as equally as possible. Provide positive one-on-one time with all of your children.

Make a habit of giving small gestures of affection to all your children. Say things like, ""I'm really proud of you"" and ""You did a great job on that assignment.""
When you have the time, spend one-on-one time with each of your children, especially ones who haven't gotten as much attention from you lately. This can sometimes be hard to schedule, but try to get in some one-on-one time a few times per week.

, Autistic children might fear being a burden, or worry that they aren't good enough. This can especially be a problem if everyone is focusing on their flaws. Avoid making your child's current inabilities into a big deal, and work on their strengths as well as their weaknesses.

Don't make a big deal out of your child's needs. If your child can't handle something, calmly offer an alternative. This way, they're less likely to feel guilty for being disabled.
Consider whether your child has any one-on-one time that isn't taken up by therapy goals. Are you ever having fun with them, or is every interaction spent working on something?
Give your child free time to just play, without being pushed to meet predefined goals. They should be able to enjoy childhood too. (And you don't need to spend the next decade transporting your child between therapies. You also can relax.)
Encourage your child to develop their strengths and special interests.

, Your non-autistic children may sometimes be frustrated or confused. They may feel their sibling gets more attention. Reassure them regularly they are valued, but have different needs. Say something like, ""We love you all the same. Lucy sometimes needs extra help when you don't. We help people when they need it, and Lucy often needs more."", Some family activities may be off limits for an autistic family member. If loud noises bother your autistic loved one, for example, going to the movies can be stressful. Try to compromise and find activities everyone can enjoy.

For example, if loud movie theaters frighten your autistic family member, home movie nights might be a lot more comfortable.

Add other family members.,
Lay your baby down in fake grass.,
Go outside.",How to Take Easter Photos of Your Baby2," You want your baby to be smiling in Easter photos. Find ways to make your baby smile. Think about what normally makes your baby smile. Do they smile when you sing or make funny faces? If so, do this from behind the camera. Then, quickly take a photograph while your baby is smiling.It helps to have one person make the baby smile while another takes pictures. Enlist the help of someone else if possible.

, Babies, especially very young babies, may nod off during photo shots. Even if this is not the pose you imagined, be open to taking a few sleeping photographs. You do not want to wake a baby just to get a picture. A baby who's, say, sleeping in an Easter basket can be a cute Easter photograph.Make sure to turn the flash off and be very quiet while photographing a sleeping baby.

, Does a local mall or community center do photo shoots with someone dressed in an Easter Bunny costume? If so, a photo of your baby with the Easter Bunny can be a cute picture. See if you can find the time to stop by and get a photo with the Easter Bunny.Keep in mind, some babies may be fearful of strangers and dislike getting photographs with someone dressed like the Easter Bunny. If your baby is shy by nature, you may want to stick to taking pictures at home.

, If you have an Easter basket, put in the photographs with your baby. You can try aligning a very large basket with blankets and placing your baby inside. This can make for a very cute Easter picture.Try putting toys your baby likes in the Easter basket. Take candid photos of your baby rifling through the basket and playing with toys.

Take many photos.,
Play around with perspective.,
Capture the details.,
Use the brightest room in the house.,
Try using a tripod.",How to Take Easter Photos of Your Baby3," Not every photo you take will turn out. Your baby may turn their head or suddenly start crying as the camera flashes, so make sure to get a lot of photos. This way, if a few don't turn out, you will have a variety of photos to choose from at the end of the shoot., Take photos from a variety of angles. Take some photos up close and others from far away. Get down on the ground and take a photo from your baby's eye level. Shoot a photo from above to get a bird's eye view. Having a variety of perspectives will give you a range of unique, quality photos., Go for a higher quality camera, if you have one, over a phone camera. This will allow you to capture more details. As your baby grows, you will want pictures preserving how they looked when they were small.Get close up pictures. Get photos of your baby's face, hands, and feet to preserve small details over time.

, Bright lights help with quality photographs. When shooting, do so in the brightest room in your home. Turn all the lights on and open any windows to get natural lighting.Rooms with a lot of windows tend to work best as they provide natural light.

Sterilize new bottle nipples.,
Consider your water source when determining how often to sterilize your bottle nipples.,
Try using a microwave sterilizer.",How to Clean Bottle Nipples1," Before using new nipples or bottles for the first time, submerge them in a pot of boiling water for at least ten minutes.Remove them from the pot with a clean pair of tongs and let them air dry on a clean towel.This method is safe on all kinds of baby bottles and will sanitize them and make them germ-free for the initial use.;
, If you have well water, you’ll want to sterilize your bottle nipples on a regular basis,but all other parents are fine moving onto everyday cleaning methods after the first sterilization.

, Another sterilization option is to buy a microwave sterilizer. To use this device, follow the instructions on the package. Microwave sterilizers generally involve placing a small amount of water in the base of the device, placing the bottle and nipples in the water, and then microwaving everything for a few minutes until the steam has sterilized the items.Microwave sterilizers are just as effective as the boiling method, and can be found at any baby store.

Pick up some good quality dish soap.,
Clean the bottle nipple after every time you use it.,
Separate all of the bottle parts and remove the nipple from any other part of the bottle.,
Squirt warm water through the hole of the nipple to make sure it is clear and working properly.A clean nipple will have a steady flow without water getting backlogged or squirting in all directions.

,
Be gentle with the bottle nipple.,
Rinse the bottle nipple with warm water and allow the object to air dry on a towel or on a special bottle-drying device available at baby stores.These devices act like trees to hold the various bottle parts and keep the pieces off the counter to dry evenly.,
Recognize mold.",How to Clean Bottle Nipples2," After being sterilized for the first use, bottle nipples can be cleaned with dish soap after each use. The only exception is if you live in an area with contaminated water or water that comes from a well. Otherwise, pediatricians believe warm water and soap sufficiently clean the bottle nips after the initial sterilization to give the nipple a fresh start.Dish soap is the best cleaner for everyday use. Avoid using harsh chemicals, such as undiluted bleach, because they can be harmful to your baby and can break down the bottle nipple materials, causing it to not work as effectively., Simple, everyday cleaning can make a big difference in your child’s bottle experience. Cleaning the bottle nipple after each use is much easier and safer than risking mold growing in dirty bottle nipples.

, Fill the sink with hot water and mild dish soap. Rinse the nipple and allow it to soak for five minutes. Use a sponge or the nipple cleaning attachment of a bottle brush (available at baby stores) to get into the folds of the nipple.

,, Bottle nipple cleaning is fairly simple and doesn’t need to be pushed beyond the basic instructions. A general rule is to be gentle about how you clean the nipple. If there is food residue on the nipple, let it soak and gently rinse it off instead of scrubbing vigorously.


Scrubbing too hard can hurt the nipple and stop it from performing like it should by interrupting the flow from the bottle, which makes it harder for your baby to drink.

, Drying racks are effective and can be beneficial, but aren’t a necessity for drying bottle accessories.

, Mold is a dark substance that doesn’t easily come off a surface. You may be able to recognize bits of food from the dishwasher as things you’ve eaten recently, but mold sticks around for a while. It also tends to be porous and has soft edges that can grow quickly.


If you notice mold or other substances growing in the bottle nipple, throw it away and start with a new nipple.

"
"
Place the bottle nipple on the top shelf of the dishwasher.,
Use hot water.,
Keep in mind that you should do whatever is easiest for you.",How to Clean Bottle Nipples3," Most bottles are dishwasher safe on the top shelf, but you should check with the bottle or nipple manufacturer to be sure.


Rinse the nipple with warm water and place it in a basket or mesh bag on the top rack of the dishwasher and run a normal or gentle cycle with the rest of your dishes.
The basket or bag keeps the nipple from getting lost in the dishwasher and is available at any baby store., Make sure the water is heated and that the dishwasher is set to a hot drying cycle so that water can dry quickly and not cause a risk of mold if it lingers on the nipple., Hand washing or using the dishwasher are both effective ways for cleaning a bottle nipple at each use—there isn’t a method that is more effective than another, so choose the one that works for your baby and your lifestyle.

Start feeding vegetables early on.As soon as your doctor recommends feeding solid foods start incorporating vegetables.,
Give your baby vegetables frequently regardless of his reaction.Even when he has a negative reaction, don't give up.,
Sneak vegetables into meal times.If you are still at the spoon feeding phase you can sneak vegetables into the meal.,
Establish a mealtime routine.This helps for babies, and continues to be effective as your baby grows older.,
Limit snacks to make eating vegetables more rewarding.If your baby is not hungry, he will not be as interested in eating vegetables.,
Dress vegetables up to be fun.Try making mealtime less about a power struggle and more about imagination.,
Show your baby that the vegetables are good.This is as simple as eating them yourself.,
Change up your vegetables.Don't try to feed him the same thing every day until he eats it.,
Use stories to encourage your baby to eat vegetables.If you like to read to your baby, try reading stories that encourage healthy habits.,
Hide vegetables in tasty meals or treats.Even as adults, people refuse to eat certain vegetables.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Eat Vegetables1," This will help acclimate your child to the different flavors. With luck, you may find that your child likes vegetables before he learns to throw his plate.;
, If he is not used to the taste he may spit it out or throw it. Continue giving him different vegetables and asking him to try each one.


Give your baby less vegetables when you anticipate a negative reaction. If he decides to throw his plate or food, you will have more to spare. Only put fresh vegetables onto his plate. If the vegetables are on the floor, throw those away.

, A couple spoonfuls of something tasty and then a random spoonful of vegetables. He may not like that bite, but you are getting him used to the vegetables.

, Have a routine during which everyone sits down to eat for a period of time. No body gets up until the meal is over. If your baby chooses not to eat then he sits there with a plate of food until the meal is over.


This is more effective with older babies. Younger babies may not understand a mealtime routine and become very anxious and upset if forced to sit without stimulation for long. Consider the age and understanding if your baby when you decide to enforce the routine.

, When he is hungry, he will feel satisfaction when eating vegetables. He will start feeling his hunger go away as soon as he eats. This self-rewarding feeling can be very beneficial to encouraging your baby to eat vegetables.

, If your baby will not eat broccoli, try telling him they are little trees. Build structures or faces on his plate. Tell him he is eating the snowman's nose rather than a carrot.

, Most of what a baby learns he learns by replicating others. If you eat the same or similar vegetables as you are feeding him then he may be more interested in eating them.


This can be difficult if you have other household members who refuse to eat their vegetables. Try to have everyone pitch in to show your baby everyone is eating the same vegetables he is.

, Try a different vegetable with each meal. He may like different brands of vegetables more than others. You may also want to try preparing them different ways such as cooked or raw.


Be careful not to mix processed vegetables in on a regular basis. Keep a close eye on the nutritional content of the vegetables you use to ensure your baby is not getting too much sodium, fats, or sugars.

, Kid's shows on television may also be a great way to stimulate your baby to emulate favorite characters. Chose stories that emphasize a certain vegetable. Then incorporate that vegetable into a meal.


Be careful with television shows and kids' movies. Although some encourage kids to eat vegetables, others may commiserate with the child. Poor choices of stories may actually discourage eating vegetables. Preview whatever you choose to show your baby.

, Many people may only eat sweet peas when they are in pot pie. Others may avoid lima beans unless they are mixed into a stew. Likewise, hiding vegetables in your baby's food may help encourage them to eat vegetables without them knowing it.


Consider a fruit and vegetable smoothie as a treat for you baby. He will likely have no idea what vegetables are in it unless you tell him. Make it right and he'll love it. Try mixing various fruits together with one or two vegetables so the vegetables' tastes are hidden.

"
"
Start by feeding your baby single bites.Vegetables are often bitter.,
Smile and laugh with your baby.Eating should be a fun experience.,
Serve vegetables and fruits together.Your baby will likely love his fruits.,
Feed your baby larger amounts of vegetables.As you familiarize him with the tastes, move beyond just one bite.,
Reward your baby after he eats his vegetables.When he eats all of his vegetables, reward him with praise or even with foods he likes.,
Practice using various rewards to learn what motivates your baby.You may find that your rewards are not effective all the time.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Eat Vegetables2," It may take some time for him to get used to the taste. Tell him ""Just one bite"" and get him used to trying them. You may even find at this point that he favors some vegetables over others.

, Don't let your frustration come out. He needs to see that even vegetables can be fun. At this stage of development, he needs a lot of positive attention. Be sure to compliment him when he tries or eats his vegetables.

, When something he likes (i.e., fruits) is served beside something he dislikes (i.e., vegetables) he will, over time, develop more positive feelings about the vegetables. This is very subtle and will take time to occur. Over time he will be more likely to eat that vegetable.

, Start giving him larger portions. The goal now is to get him to eat rather than simply taste. Don't reward him with smiles and praise as often for a single bite. Make him work harder for his reward.

, For example, you may give him an extra helping of fruit when he finishes his vegetables. A favorite dessert may also be a good motivational tool.


For this to be effective it must be consistent and quickly given. As soon as he eats the last bite he should be receiving the reward, if possible. Even before he can talk and communicate he will begin associating vegetables with praise and rewards.
Don't reward your child if he does not eat. You may be frustrated that the reward is ""wasted"" when you do not give it to him and it goes bad. Choose your rewards carefully to avoid this situation.

, Switch it up and see what else you can motivate him with. Try one different reward per meal to see what works.


Keep track of how much your baby likes each reward. Try to save the best rewards for the more disliked vegetables.
Add non-food rewards into the mix. Using only food as a reward may encourage your baby to overeat. Stick with healthy foods like fruits for food rewards, but start adding in favorite activities when your baby is old enough to understand.

Wash his face.,
Take off his diaper.,
Place your baby in the tub.,
Wash his hair.,
Wash his body.,
Clean the diaper area.,
Dry him off.,
Give him a massage.,
Put on his diaper and clothes.",How to Bathe a Baby Boy," To give your baby a bath you will need to gather together a clean tub to use, such as a washing up tub or special baby bath, two towels and some cotton wool (cotton balls). You will also need a cup to use to rinse him and a washcloth. You should also grab a clean diaper and some fresh clothes that you will dress him in after the bath.Plain water is best for your baby's skin for the first month. After this, you may use a mild baby soap to wash his bottom and in the folds on his arms and legs.If your baby is 12 months old or older, you can use a mild baby shampoo and a mild baby soap.;
, Next you need to add warm water to the tub. The amount of water you are recommended to use can vary, but often parents are advised to add 2 to 3 inches. If you use this amount you should carefully pour warm water from the tub over you baby during the bath to keep him warm.


Some research has suggested that using more water, enough to cover his shoulder’s, can help to keep him calm during his bath.
However much water you use, make sure you hold him securely at all times.Check the temperature of the water with your wrists to ensure it is warm not hot., You can wash your boy’s face before you put him into the tub. Take off all his clothes apart from a onesie and his diaper, wrap him in a towel and then hold him on your knee or lay him on his changing mat. Dip a cotton ball in the bath water and gently wipe around his eyes, from the nose outwards towards the ears. Do this with a fresh piece of cotton wool for each eye


Then get a fresh cotton ball, dip it in the bath water and wash gently around his ears, but not inside them.
Repeat this with a fresh cotton ball around his other ear.
Then dampen some more cotton balls and wash the rest of his face, neck and hands.
Gently dry him with a soft towel., To finish preparing him for the bath, take off his onesie and diaper and clean around his bottom and genitals with some fresh cotton wool that has been dipped in the warm water. It’s important to clean up any mess before you put him into the tub.This step is just to clean off any surface soiling. It is not a thorough cleaning of the area — this comes later.

, Once you are ready to place your boy in the bath, lower him gently into the tub. Use one hand to hold his upper arm and support his head, neck, and shoulders as you do this., If your baby has hair you should wash it if it seems dirty or he is developing cradle cap. This is a common condition which brings about scaly patches of skin on the baby’s scalp. Support his head and shoulders with one hand, and then gently massage a drop of mild baby shampoo into his scalp.


Cup one of your hands above his eyes to protect them, and then rinse his head with a dampened washcloth, or warm water from the tap.If you use water direct from the tap make sure you check the temperature first.

, Dip a washcloth in warm water and wash your baby’s neck and torso. You usually don’t need soap when cleaning most parts of a baby, so the plain water in the bath is fine. Clean under his arms and between his fingers, then clean his legs and toes. Make sure you are cleaning the folds and creases in your baby's skin.


As well as using a washcloth you can gently swish the water over his body, but take care not to splash him.
Always use one hand to support his body at all times, keeping his head well up above the water line.
Never leave him unattended in the bath for even a second., Use a clean cloth or cotton ball dipped in the water to carefully wash around his bottom and genitals. If your baby boy is uncircumcised, don’t try to pull back the foreskin. The foreskin will separate from the head of the penis over time, and you should allow this to happen naturally.


If you try to force to foreskin back to clean the head of the penis you may cause a tear in the skin, which can cause problems later on.
If he has been circumcised follow the instructions your doctor gave you.
A circumcised penis may take a week to ten days to heal.
Again, once your baby is older than a few weeks, you can use a use mild baby soap to clean his bottom, genitals, and the folds of his skin. Avoid products with alcohol or perfume., When you are finishing with the bath, lift out and him and pat him dry with a clean, warm towel. Be sure to pay close attention to the folds in his skin where moisture can gather. Drying inside the folds of the skin is the best way to avoid rashes for a very young baby., After bathing is a great time to give your baby a quick massage. A massage can help calm and relax him, and can help him go to sleep. If your baby has dry or eczema-prone skin, squirt some hypoallergenic lotion onto your palms, rubbing them together to warm up the lotion. Then massage it into his skin.


To avoid skin irritations, don’t use any lotions or oils until your baby is at least a month old., Once your baby is dry and massaged, put him in a clean diaper and clothes.

Decide on a weaning schedule.,
Start replacing breastfeeding with bottle feeding.,
Stay out of the room for the bottle feeding.",How to Wean a Baby from Breastfeeding1," You need to taper off gradually, not just immediately stop breastfeeding. Based on how long you have determined you have and then number of feedings you give your child per day, you will be able to figure out how to best wean your baby. It’s important to start slowly, both for you and the baby. He needs to get used to not breastfeeding, and your body needs to let down from producing milk.Weaning can be very tough for both the mother and the baby — be mentally ready for a challenge.;
, The easiest way to start moving your baby away from being dependent upon breastfeeding is to move her onto drinking formula from a bottle. Babies should not drink milk until they are a year old — then you can let them drink milk from a bottle as well.You can also try replacing breast feeding with formula in a cup if your baby seems ready. There are many options of cups meant for babies over six months old.


Replace one of the feedings per day with a bottle.
Start with her least favorite feeding.
After a few days or longer, replace another feeding with a bottle feed.
Continue replacing bottles for times you typically breastfeed.

, Babies can smell milk and understand when you’re near. Get someone else to do the feeding when you can."
"
Avoid making the act of not breastfeeding a big issue.,
Work on phasing out the night feedings.,
Start a new bedtime routine.",How to Wean a Baby from Breastfeeding2," Babies can take different amounts of time to finally stop breastfeeding. If you withhold the breast from the baby and she is gesturing her desire for it (licking lips, placing hands on your breast) it might make it into an issue when it wasn’t before. Try distracting her before she can start getting interested in breastfeeding at times when she typically wants to nurse., Breastfeeding your baby at night and in the early morning are often the most difficult habits to break. Many babies find it very comforting to fall asleep right after breastfeeding, or eat immediately upon waking. Some children might take easily to a bottle instead of the breast, but many like the comfort and closeness of breastfeeding and will resist switching to a bottle.Try holding your baby in the same position as you do when breastfeeding when you try to give him a bottle.

, Rather than the feedings being what you and your baby do to snuggle down, think about other ways she could relax. Some of the ways you can try to get your baby to sleep include:


Singing to your baby
Reading books to your baby
Patting your baby’s back

"
"
Find good solid foods to supplement your baby’s nutritional intake.,
Do not expect the baby to swallow much food.,
Begin the weaning process with just one food.",How to Wean a Baby from Breastfeeding3," If your baby is over six months old, it’s time to begin solid foods. Any earlier, and babies’ heads and necks tend to not be strong enough to support swallowing solids. Some foods are particularly good when weaning your baby. Weaning foods are complementary in nature — that is, they complement mother’s milk. The basic purpose of introducing these foods is: a) to provide taste and variety to the baby’s diet; b) to provide the “missing” nutrients; c) to teach the baby swallowing, chewing and eating skills; and d) to habituate the baby to the exact taste and flavor of home meals.Begin with liquids, then go on to semi-solids and finally to normal home foods. By the age of ten months, the baby should be eating an almost full diet.
Most pre-made baby foods have ""stages"" of foods to help you decide which foods to start with. Many parents start with rice or other grain cereals and go on to vegetables or fruits next.

, He is still learning to chew/swallow the food, and there will be times when the baby seems to be “refusing” the food, or even “throwing” it back out, when actually, he is just unable to co-ordinate his mouth and tongue movements sufficiently enough to put the food inside.


Start with just one to two tablespoons of solid food and increase over time as you baby wants more.

, Give this food daily for the first three to four days. Ensure that she is able to eat it, digest it and remain free from any allergic symptoms like coughing, loose bowel movements, or rashes. After the four days or so are up, start with another new item. A food item that does not agree with the baby can be re-tried after some weeks as long as it doesn't cause hives, wheezing, swelling, or trouble breathing.


In cases of families with a history of food allergies, atopic eczema, drug intolerance etc, new foods should be tried with caution.

"
"
Decide the best way to wean your child.,
Choose the appropriate time.,
Introduce your child to a sippy cup.",How to Wean Your Baby off the Bottle1," There are two primary ways to do this. As every child is different, a parent is best suited to judge which method works best for their child. Consider your circumstances before you decide.


Gradual weaning may be the easier way to phase out your bottle if your child is fussy. By slowly eliminating the bottle, your child almost won't notice. This is good when you have a lot of time. It is not ideal for older children, as they will not have the time frame to go slow enough.
In some cases, it may be necessary to just go cold turkey. This can be harder for some parents as it may result in fussiness or tantrums, leaving the parents feeling cruel; however, this is the fastest way to wean. Going cold turkey works best with very willing children and children who should have already been weaned from the bottle.;
, During certain ages children are more likely to try to appease their parents. Also, there is a certain age before which you should not wean your child. The success you have weaning your child has much to do with your timing. It is recommended that most children start to use sippy cups between the ages of six and nine months.Your baby needs to be developed enough to sit on his own and to eat solid foods from a spoon. You will not have success if you introduce the sippy cup sooner than your child is developmentally ready.
You should not choose to take away the bottle during the time of trying to move the child to a new bed, getting a new family member or pet, moving to a new home, changing babysitters, teething or any other potential events that may cause upsets for your child. These can derail your attempts.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends weaning from the bottle by 18 months. Waiting too long increases your child's risk of tooth decay, obesity, ear infections, and changes in the position of your child's teeth., This introduction can begin as early as six months of age. Allow the baby to explore the cup. He may even ""play"" with it rather than drink from it during the initial introduction. You will see him trying to use it as he becomes more familiar with it.


In general, only give formula or breast milk or, rarely, water, in the bottle. Offer other drinks such as healthy juices or milk (once the child is a year old) only in the cup. Your child will learn that the cup is where he gets these other drinks.

"
"
Give the baby a sippy cup instead of a bottle during mealtime.,
Remain consistent during the weaning process.",How to Wean Your Baby off the Bottle2," Begin using the cup at one meal per day once the child is familiar with the cup. This may occur at eight to ten months old. Then, replace your baby's bottle at other meals. Do this until all meals are eaten with a sippy cup instead of a bottle.


Start with meals in the middle of the day and with snacks.
Work on one feeding at a time. Don't rush, but be sure to always make progress.
Offer your child a sippy cup instead of a bottle during other times of the day such as nap time and snack time preparation.
Children are less likely to give up feeding habits first thing in the morning and right before bed. These are times when a child is likely to seek comfort.For weaning the night time bottle, have a bedtime ritual in place such as a warm bath, a story, and a favorite toy. This can help reduce the stress of losing the bottle.

, Going back and forth between the bottle and sippy cup during meals will only confuse the child. Continually diminish the presence of the bottle. Keep track of how frequently your child uses a bottle.

"
"
Be firm.,
Use critical periods.,
Make it an event.",How to Wean Your Baby off the Bottle3," When you go cold turkey, you must expect your child to be unhappy about it. She may want her bottle, and she may not take no for an answer. By giving in, you undercut your efforts. It is important for the success of this effort that you remain strong. Don't give in to your child's demands.

, A major, and easy, milestone one can use for the transition to sippy cups is the child's first birthday. This coincides with the transition from breast to cow's milk.It is acceptable to wait a little longer, but make sure to wean your child before eighteen months.

Switch no earlier than six months, as children at that age are too young.
Aim for the child's first birthday, as this is a natural milestone.

, Tell your child that on a certain special day coming up, he will have the opportunity to trade all of his bottles for some fantastic thing he wants. Tell him he gets to take some time to think of something he wants, and if he chooses, he can make the trade.By planting the idea and giving your child time to imagine something he wants, you get him to sell himself on the possibility of giving up the bottle.


Remind him that the day is coming up.
Offer suggestions, such as a really nice cup or a new toy.

Try to wake your baby up when she is sleeping lightly.,
Sit beside your baby if she is in a deep sleep.,
Try using light touches to wake your baby up.,
Take your baby out of her crib to help wake her up.,
Hold your baby in a feeding position.,
Tickle your baby's feet or hands.,
Use a cool cloth to wake your baby up.,
Let light into the room that your baby is sleeping in.,
Make some noise in the room where you baby is sleeping.,
Recognize the importance of feeding every two hours.",How to Wake a Baby for Feeding1," Like adults, babies can also fall into a lighter or deeper sleep. Your baby’s body cycles through these phases of light sleep and deep sleep. Try to only wake your baby up when she is in a light sleep, as this will be easier than waking her when she is sleeping deeply. You can tell when your baby is in a light sleep by looking for these signs:


Your baby moves her mouth as if sucking.
Moving her arms and legs.
Smiling in her sleep.;
, As mentioned above, you should try to avoid waking your baby when she is in a deep sleep. If you want to feed her but see that she is sleeping deeply, you may just want to sit and do some quiet activity near by until she starts showing signs of entering into a light sleeping phase.

, Skin contact can help to ease your baby into wakefulness. Try removing her blanket or clothes, and gently stroking her arm while she sleeps to help wake her up. Try gently stroking her head or cheek.


The physical stimulation, as well as a brief exposure to the cold, may be enough to wake him up.
Skin-to-skin contact helps to calm a stressed baby and prepares him for feeding.
You can also try dripping a small amount of milk onto your baby’s mouth. Some babies will wake up at the taste of milk.

, Taking her out of her crib and holding her in an upright position may be able to help her transition into a light sleep, or even into wakefulness.


While holding her like this, try singing or talking to help wake her up.

, Hold your baby like you are going to feed her, and then run some milk along her lip. Being in this position and tasting milk may help to wake her up.

, Try tickling your baby’s feet lightly to see if you can wake your baby up that way. You can also try gently blowing on her face or touching her cheek.


You may find that your baby reflexively turns her head to the side when you stroke her cheek because she thinks it is your breast touching her.

, Changes in temperature may help to wake your baby up. You can try getting a washcloth wet with cold water, and then applying the wet part of the cloth to your baby’s head, feet, or arms.


Removing her blanket may also help to wake her up, as she will suddenly be able to feel the cool temperature of the room.

, If your baby is sleeping in a darkened room, try letting some natural light in by opening the blinds. Your baby’s eyes are sensitive to changes in light.


However, too much light will make your baby want to keep her eyes closed, so try to let just a little light into the room.

, This does not mean that you should yell or try to bang things to wake her up; try instead to sing or talk with your partner. The sound of your voices may be enough to rouse your baby.

, It’s important that your baby is fed every 2-3 hours for them to stay healthy and well nourished.


Their small stomachs can digest food quickly, in about 90 minutes, so you have to make sure that their bellies are not empty, to avoid a fussy, hungry baby.
Even if your baby is already sleeping, you need to make sure they are fed.
This is important especially for newborn babies who need to be religiously fed every 2-3 hours, until your baby is ready to set his own feeding pace.

Look into on-site daycare.",How to Bond with Your Baby As a Working Parent," Watch your baby’s body movements, facial expressions, and vocalizations to figure out what they are trying to communicate. Over time, you may be able to distinguish an “I’m tired” cry from an “I want a diaper change” cry.The more sensitive you become to your baby’s needs, the faster you can meet that need and the better your bond can become, which is important if you spend limited time with your baby.


Notice the types of environments your baby enjoys. Some babies prefer noise and excitement while others like a quiet, relaxed environment. Make the most of your time together by being sensitive to these things.;
, Your baby will enjoy the sound of your voice.Narrate what’s happening around you and what you’re going to do next. Talk about everyday tasks by saying, “Now we’re putting on your socks. One sock, two socks. Now it’s time to change your diaper.” Even if you’re getting ready for work, talk to your baby and let them know what is happening.


Sing to your baby and share the joy of music. You may feel silly, but allow your child to hear your voice and enjoy your songs.

, Be sensitive to your baby’s actions, wants, and interactions. Keep communication a two-way street by being attentive to your baby’s cues and showing your baby that you understand.If your baby coos at you, verbalize back. Mimic the sounds your baby makes and acknowledge your baby’s desire to communicate with you.While you may be tired or in a bad mood, your child may want to interact with you, even after a long day’s work. Go along with what your baby would like to initiate. Save some energy after your workday to interact with your baby.

, Babies can benefit from following a regular and predictable schedule. When it comes to your work schedule, keep it as predictable as possible so your baby knows it can look forward to seeing you.


Be able to adapt to any new changes or adjustments that are needed as your baby develops.For example, if you tend to wake up early to spend time with your baby, be flexible if your baby starts needing to sleep late and make up the time at the end of the day.

, Have a ‘just got home from work’ ritual with your baby. Greet your baby the same way each day: a hug, a kiss, and an “I’m happy to see you!” You can also engage in the same activity each time you reunite. For example, play peek-a-boo, give your baby a massage, sing a song, or go outside for a walk together. This kind of predictability can help your baby adjust and look forward to seeing you.

, If you constantly have friends or family over for the weekends, consider taking at least one day off to spend with your baby. Do activities that involve just you and your baby. That way, your baby will be focused on you and nobody else.


You can also spend time together with your partner and your baby.

, Cherish the little moments with your baby. Engage in eye contact, touch, laughter, and play. It’s not just your baby who enjoys these moments; they can feel greatly fulfilling to you, too. Your tone of voice, touch, and interaction style can all help strengthen the bond between you and your baby.Set aside special time before you go to work or after you get home for these activities. Your baby may begin to look forward to these special times together.
Find things that make your baby smile or laugh and make a daily habit to have these types of interactions.

, Bathtime can be a fun and bonding time to spend with your baby.Many babies enjoy taking baths and find them calm and relaxing. Use this time to engage with your child and interact through play. Let your child splash and play without rushing them to hurry up. Set aside adequate time to enjoy and relax through the bath.


A bath can be nice before bedtime, especially if your baby has difficulty falling asleep.
Even if your baby doesn’t need a bath, use baths to relax and calm your baby. Enjoying every moment with your baby is important when you’re a working parent, and having a calm and relaxed baby can help you enjoy these moments instead of feeling frazzled.

, Nursing mothers can spend quality time with their babies through breastfeeding. Make eye contact with your baby and enjoy the contact on your baby’s skin on your own. If you bottle feed, skin-on-skin contact can boost bonding with your baby during feeding.While your baby may receive feedings from a care provider through the day, make the feeding time with you special by including the special contact.


Fathers can practice feeding their babies with a bottle using skin contact as well.

, When your opportunities to spend time together are limited, choose an activity that maximizes bonding potential. Babies, especially premature babies and those with medical problems, greatly enjoy massages.Touch is an important way to connect with your baby. If you give your baby medications or if your child has a hard time with certain activities, work in a massage to help calm your baby. Bonding through baby massage can help your baby feel safe, secure, and close with you.


Learn how to give your baby a massage by checking out How to Massage a Baby.

, Kangaroo care is when you hold your baby up against your skin. This type of holding is thought to improve your baby’s development, and it may also help to promote bonding.Try holding your baby while wearing a tank top so that they can have more contact with your skin.


Make sure that the baby’s skin can make contact with yours as well, such as by holding your baby while they are wearing only a diaper.

, Don’t feel guilty or ashamed of wanting or needing to work with a baby. Even if you spent every moment of every day with your child, there’s no way you could be a perfect parent. Having a bond with your baby means spending quality time together and being responsive to one another. A securely attached baby has their cues understood at least one-third of the time (not every time).Even if you don’t understand your baby’s cue, keep trying and recognize that one miss won’t destroy your bond.


If you miss your baby’s cue, do your best to correct for it and meet the need.
If you do miss your baby throughout the day while you’re at work, make the time you do spend together in quality interactions.

, If your baby is small enough to fit in a front-facing carrier, bring your baby with you on errands and along for your daily activities.This can give you and your baby that feeling of closeness while you go about your routine activities such as cleaning the house, making dinner, or folding laundry. Your baby can look at you, feel your body, and know that you’re close.


If your baby prefers a bouncer or cradle, face your baby toward you as you do activities so that they can watch you.
A sling can also be helpful for providing closeness while keeping your hands free to do other things. Carrying your baby in a sling can provide benefits to your baby as well, such as giving them more opportunities to learn and making them feel more secure., Parents who use a nanny or a babysitter can consider sending them to make quick errands for you during the day. That way, you can come straight home and spend time with your little one. You can also check out agencies that specialize in errand-running so that you can have the groceries ready, mail sent, and laundry picked up without you having to worry about it.Consider the costs of the services versus the benefits of spending more time with your baby.

, Just as it’s important for a baby to bond with parents, it’s also important for siblings to create a bond.Let older siblings gently play or take care of the baby. Let your child play next to the baby or hold the baby with supervision. Allow them to begin their relationship successfully.


Let older children participate in bonding activities such as bathtime, feeding, and giving skin contact.

, If your workplace offers on-site daycare, then this could be an excellent way for you to spend more time with your baby. You could visit during your lunch hour or go down on breaks to breastfeed your baby.


If your employer offers on-site daycare, pay a visit to see what it is like.

Draw your baby’s attention when she does start to wake up.,
Try to feed your baby in a position that she is less inclined to sleep in.,
Move your baby to the other breast.,
Burp your baby.,
Try to give your baby more milk.",How to Wake a Baby for Feeding2," Once your baby is awake, you need to try to keep her awake so that you can feed her. Laugh at her, talk to her, and look her in the eyes to keep her attention on you.


You can also try tickling her.

, When you tuck her up against your body, your warmth and heartbeat can lull your baby back to sleep.


Instead, hold her with one arm and hold her head with your other hand, keeping her a small distance away from your body heat.

, When you see that your baby is starting to lose interest and fall back to sleep, try to move her to your other breast. This movement will help to keep her awake and engaged.


You can also try removing your nipple from your baby’s mouth. Moving to release your nipple will help to wake your baby up. It will also help to remind her that she is still hungry. You can also try dropping a little milk on her mouth.

, Make a movement like you are going to burp your baby. This movement will help to wake her up, while also helping her to burp. Once she has burped, settle her back down on to your other breast.

, Changes in the pressure of the milk your baby is receiving can help to keep her awake. You can change how much milk your baby gets by massaging your breast and squeezing the area around your nipple.


However, do not give your baby too much milk, as she could choke.

Make it into a spread.,
Use it as a drizzle or dipping sauce.,
Pair it with yogurt or cottage cheese.,
Blend it into a smoothie.,
Freeze it into popsicles or fruity ice cubes.,
Use it as a healthy sweetener.,
Bake with it.",How to Use Leftover Baby Food1," Using a butter knife or spoon, remove baby food from the jar and spread it on a piece of toast, bagel, or cracker. Single-fruit baby foods, such as apricot and banana, work particularly well as spreads. The natural sugar content is high enough to mimic a store bought jam and the consistency is thick enough to stay on the top of bread without being totally absorbed.This also makes a great toddler snack. Cut up the bread with spread into long, thin pieces or small squares for a healthy “finger-food."";
, Take a spoon and drizzle baby food with a smooth consistency and complimentary flavor, such as pear, over a baked chicken or even a dessert, like a tart. Or, take the baby food out of the jar and place a small amount of it on a plate to be used as a dipping sauce with veggie sticks, chicken nuggets, etc.Feel free to add additional spices to the baby food to amplify its flavor as a dip. For example, you could add cinnamon to an apple baby food and then dip French toast sticks into the mixture.
If your baby food is Stage 1 and a smooth consistency, it is ready to be used as a side sauce. If it is a Stage 2 or higher (a bit more chunky), place the baby food in a food processor and pulse for a few times to smooth it out. Or, place the baby food in a bowl and whip it with a fork until it is a smooth consistency.

, Get a bowl, add a few spoons of cottage cheese or yogurt, and place some fruit baby food on top. You can eat it as is, or you can mix it all together. This makes an exceptionally healthy snack for children or adults.This recipe is also something that kids can help make. Give them the bowl with the yogurt and a bowl with baby food. Then ask them to mix the two together with spoons. They can taste test the various versions. A warning, though, this process may get a bit messy depending on the age of your child.

, Throw some ice cubes, fresh fruit, yogurt, and fruit baby food into a blender and pulse until smooth. You can also add fruit juice or milk if you prefer. Play with the consistency to see what you like, adding more food or less ice in different versions.


You can always make smoothies in bulk and then place them in to-go cups in the refrigerator until you want them. A good combination might be ice, orange juice, pear baby food, fresh strawberries, and plain yogurt.
This is another possible food prep activity for kids. Set out all the available ingredients and let your kids decide what to place in the blender. You blend everything together and then let them taste test their creations.

, Get an ice cube tray or plastic popsicle freezer tray. In a bowl or food processor, mix together baby food and fruit juice. Continue until you have a close-to-liquid consistency. Pour the mixture into the trays and freeze at least overnight.You can use the ice cubes with a fruity drink or even water to create additional flavor. The popsicles make a great, cool snack for children and adults. Feel free to include chunkier baby food or even fruit chunks in the mixture; just be careful not to give the final product to young children as it could present a choking hazard.

, Keep a few jars of fruit baby food available as a healthy substitute for sugar in your everyday recipes. For example, if you sprinkle sugar on top of your oatmeal for breakfast, try adding a spoonful of pureed apples instead. You will find that you eventually won’t notice the difference in taste at all., You can use baby food in a wide variety of baking recipes. Baby food adds moisture and additional flavor to most baked goods. You can find tons of recipes online by searching “baked goods and baby food” or “baking with baby food.” Look for those recipes with strong reviews and clear instructions.


Cookies, cakes, biscuits, pancakes, and breads are just a few baking options when using leftover baby food. For example, banana baby food is a great addition to a traditional banana bread recipe."
"
Glaze or marinate with baby food.,
Hide the baby food in soups.,
Add it as a binder to meat recipes.,
Mix it with eggs.,
Add it to pasta or rice recipes.",How to Use Leftover Baby Food2," This can actually work with either fruit or vegetable baby food; however, many people like the idea of ‘hiding’ veggies in this way. Get a cut of meat, season it, place it in a Ziploc bag, add a few jars of baby food, gently shake the bag to coat the meat, and let it sit overnight in the fridge prior to cooking., Ramp up the health factor in your run-of-the-mill soup by adding a jar or two of either meat or vegetable baby food. For example, in a vegetable soup you could add a jar of chicken baby food for additional texture and protein. Or, you could add a jar of mushed peas to make the broth taste richer.This is an especially good strategy to use if you have a picky eater who refuses to try certain vegetables. You can introduce the flavors to them in this subtle way and perhaps they will come to enjoy the taste.

, In addition to adding an egg in your meatloaf or hamburger mixture, throw in a jar of vegetable baby food as well. It will help to bind the ingredients together and it will contribute additional flavors and nutrients. For example, in a meatball recipe you might include a jar of green beans., Create an omelet or scrambled egg station with various toppings including cheese, meats, veggies, and baby food. If you add the baby food with these other items, you won’t even be able to taste it and you will get the nutritional benefit. Try to stick with baby foods with a more subtle taste such as mixed vegetables.


Add the baby food in to your egg mixture little by little to avoid creating a runny mess. Keep an eye on the eggs to make sure that the baby food doesn’t just burn to the outside and actually mixes in with other ingredients.
This is another moment where you can invite your kids to help cook. Set out the ingredient options and let them decide what to add to their eggs.

, After you’ve finished cooking the pasta or rice, and before you add any sauce, mix in some vegetable baby food. It will bind rather quickly with the rice or pasta, adding flavor instantly. Try to pick a baby food that will work well with your sauce selection. For example, a squash baby food pairs well with a spaghetti sauce.

"
Mix up a bath soak.,
Stir together a face and body scrub.,
Create a sensory bin.,
Use baby food as safe paint.",How to Use Leftover Baby Food3," This is an option that will work if you have leftover baby oatmeal or cereal. Run a nice warm bath and pour some of the oatmeal directly into the water (how much you use it up to you). The oatmeal will help to soothe irritated skin. You can also rub it against your skin with a hand towel or loofa to exfoliate.Oatmeal, in particular, can also lessen itching. So, if you or your child comes down with any type of rash, an oatmeal bath may be a good idea. It also has the benefit of being non-toxic in case of ingestion by younger children.

, Get out a small bowl and add two jars of fruit baby food of your choice. Stage 1 will work the best. Then, add a couple drops of essential oil. Stir together and gradually add raw sugar until it reaches a thick, but moveable consistency. Use this mixture as a face or body scrub while taking a bath or shower.You can also make extra batches and store them for up to a week in a sealed container. If you fill up decorative glass jars this can also be a great gift idea.

, Pull out a plastic bin and pour in your leftover baby cereals and liquid baby food. Then, let your child play and explore the different textures. Like many sensory activities, this can get quite messy so you may want to put a few towels down or even a plastic shower curtain before getting started. When they are finished, throw away the leftover food and rinse off all items that were used., Empty five or so varied colors of baby food into plastic bowls. Set out the bowls on a covered surface along with blank large sheets of paper. Let your child paint with their hands or give them brushes that they can use.


This type of art is not meant to last and be displayed. After the creation process is done you will need to throw away the food and art. Rinse off the artist and the utensils used."
"
Give it to a friend or family member.,
Donate it to a charity organization.,
Feed the sick with baby food.",How to Use Leftover Baby Food4," Baby food is expensive and usually lasts for quite a while. If you know someone who is expecting, offer to give them the food. You will help them out and it will clean out your pantry. Just make sure that none of the food is expired and that all of the jars are in good shape without chips, etc.

, Contact your local domestic violence shelter or food bank and ask if they are accepting baby food donations. They will most likely answer with an enthusiastic, “Yes!” If that is the case, drop by the leftover food that you have. Make sure that it is unexpired and not opened., Both sick animals and humans can eat baby food as part of a recuperating diet. Baby food is easy to consume and digest, making it ideal for anyone with an illness to overcome. If you feed it to your animal, just make sure that the baby food is non-toxic for them. For example, a beef baby food with onions would not be a good idea for cats."
"
Store unopened jars and pouches of baby food in a dry, dark location.,
Rotate jars and pouches out by expiration date.,
Store uncontaminated, opened jars in the refrigerator.,
Never store contaminated jars.,
Do not allow open containers to sit out at room temperature for more than two hours.",How to Store Baby Food1," A pantry or cupboard works best. Look for a relatively cool location and avoid notably warm spots. Even though the packaging should prevent the food from spoiling, prolonged heat still has the potential to spur bacteria growth.;
, Place the jars with the earliest expiration dates toward the front of your stockpile every time you restock. Doing so may help you to remember to use food before it expires.

, Tightly close the lid and use the food within 2 or 3 days.

, If you fed your baby directly from the jar, throw it away. Bacteria from your baby's saliva will transfer into the food and grow as it sits, making it unsafe for consumption later.

, Bacteria grow rapidly at room temperature, especially in liquid and pureed foods.

Determine how much vitamin D your baby needs.,
Decide whether you need to supplement.,
Give your baby vitamin D drops.,
Avoid giving too much vitamin D. Since vitamin D is fat-soluble, it is possible to give too much which becomes stored in fat tissue.,
Take your baby out into the sunshine.,
Learn what vitamin D does for the body.,
Prevent bone disease with vitamin D. Vitamin D prevents rickets, a disease in which bones can bend and become deformed.,
Reduce your baby's risk for illnesses.",How to Supplement Vitamin D in Babies," The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breast-fed infants get 400 International Units (IU) of vitamin D every day. If your baby takes a cow's milk-based or other formula, ask whether you should supplement. Most formulas are fortified with the recommended 400 IU of vitamin D (although these babies might need supplements later in life).


Breastfeeding mothers should get 600 IU of vitamin D a day.;
, Most vitamin D supplements are available to breastfed babies without a prescription (although you may get one from your doctor for insurance purposes). Your baby might be at higher risk for vitamin D deficiency if he is breastfed, has dark skin, lives at a higher latitude, or gets little sun-exposure (especially if he was born during the winter months).Continue to supplement your baby until he's weaned.


You probably don't need to supplement with vitamin D if your baby takes a formula that's already fortified with vitamin D.
You don't need to supplement if your baby is drinking cow's milk or spends lots of time in the sun.

, Vitamin D is most conveniently available in liquid drop form. Just be sure to get vitamin D3 drops. Some supplements contain the entire 400 IU dosage in a single drop while others contain the dosage in 1 ml servings. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions and try to give him the drop before feeding (in case he spits up).


If your baby struggles to take the drops, try placing the drop right on your nipple right before your baby latches on for feeding.

, To avoid toxicity, only give your baby 400 to 500 IU of vitamin D a day (if he's less than 12 months old). The most vitamin D your baby can tolerate is 1000 IU a day (if less than 6 months old).The UL for babies from 6 to 12 months is 1500 IU a day.

, You can also take your baby out into the sun for a few minutes if it's warm enough outside. Your baby can get enough vitamin D from just a few minutes of afternoon sun 2 to 3 times a week, although this can vary depending on the season, the amount of cloud cover, pollution, the shade of your skin, and whether or not your baby is wearing sunscreen.Never use tanning beds as a substitute for sunlight.

, Your baby's body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium in the gut. It's also important for bone growth because it allows your baby's bones to get strengthening minerals. The bones also need vitamin D for bone remodeling which is constantly happening and vital for strong bones and teeth.

, Rickets can cause your child to have fragile bones and a misshapen skeleton.Fortunately, vitamin D protects your baby's bones by helping the bones create a hard shell.


Vitamin D is also important in preventing your baby's bones from softening while they're growing (a disease called osteomalacia). , Your baby's cells and immune system need vitamin D to function properly. If your baby doesn't get enough vitamin D in infancy he'll be at a higher risk of having colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and Type 1 diabetes later in life. Supplementing with vitamin D can reduce your baby's risk of developing these conditions later in life:Severe respiratory (lung) infections
Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes
High blood pressure
Insulin resistance (pre-diabetes)
Multiple sclerosis

Pop the frozen cubes of baby food out of the tray.,
Alternatively, pour the pureed food into a small freezer-safe jar.,
Label each bag or container with the contents and date.

,
Rotate your stock.,
Do not store homemade baby food in the refrigerator.",How to Store Baby Food2," Use warm, soapy water or run them through a dishwasher cycle. You can also submerge the trays in boiling water. Before doing so, however, check the manufacturer's instructions to ensure that the trays are dishwasher safe and able to withstand boiling water.

, Fill each cube to the top, but do not allow the food to overflow.

, Make sure the wrap forms a sturdy seal along the edge of the tray to prevent dust or other contaminants from getting into the food.

, The food must be solid enough to maintain its shape outside of the tray.

, Place them inside a large freezer bag or an airtight, freezable container.

, Most glass jars will chip under extreme cold, but some manufacturers produce freezer-safe glass and plastic containers. Leave an inch of air in between the food and the rim to give the baby food room to expand as it freezes.

,, Put the most recently frozen food behind the oldest food in the freezer. Store baby food in the freezer for up to three months, but no longer.

, Use the refrigerator to slowly thaw frozen food, but use any baby food you place in the refrigerator within 48 hours. Anything that sits in the refrigerator past that amount of time may start to develop bacteria.

Know what foods will meet your baby’s nutritional needs.,
Shop and prepare food beforehand.,
Cook the food with as little water as possible.,
Let the food cool and then puree’.,
Freeze the food immediately.,
Defrost food when needed.",How to Preserve Baby Food," Babies need different foods at different points in their development. The younger they are, the more limited the diet. When you first begin giving them solid foods, it should be iron-fortified infant cereal and should be purchased because the homemade version lacks the iron your baby needs. Once the baby begins accepting the cereal, you can introduce more foods. The following are the minimum amounts to serve your baby, but don’t get discouraged if your baby doesn’t eat it all; babies regulate their own caloric intake:


Babies will need different items and/or amounts for breakfast, depending on their age. At 4 to 7 months, babies need 4 to 8 fluid oz. of breast milk or formula, and 0 to 3 tbsp. of infant cereal. At 8 to 11 months babies need 6 to 8 fluid oz. of breast milk or formula, 2 to 4 tbsp. of infant cereal, and 1 to 4 tbsp. of fruit and/or vegetable.
Babies will also need different food items for lunch or dinner depending on their age. At 4 to 7 months, babies need 4 to 8 fluid oz. of breast milk or formula, 0 to 3 tbsp. of infant cereal, and 0 to 3 tbsp. of fruit and/or vegetable.
At 8 to 11 months, babies need 6 to 8 fluid oz. of breast milk or formula, 2 to 4 tbsp. of infant cereal, 1 to 4 tbsp. of fruit and/or vegetable, and 1 to 4 tbsp. of meat or meat alternative.
Snacks are also important for babies. Since babies have smaller stomachs, they take in less food and need to eat more often. At 4 to 7 months, babies need 4 to 6 fluid oz. of breast milk or formula. At 8 to 11 months, babies need 2 to 4 fluid oz. of breast milk or formula, and 0 to 1/2 bread or 0 to 2 crackers.;
, Get all the tools and food out and ready before you start cooking. You should keep all meat and produce separate to avoid any cross contamination.


When purchasing food, you might want to consider organic to get as little chemical pesticide in your babies food. Also, consider purchasing meats with little or no additives.
Purchase produce the day of or day before you plan to make the food. The reason for this is that once produce is harvested, it immediately begins to lose nutritional value. In order to get the freshest foods, consider buying local and in season produce.
Always wash produce before cutting and cooking it. Do not wash meat before using it because it can spread bacteria.
Baby food does not need any spices, salt or pepper. Babies are more sensitive to flavor than adults and shouldn’t have meals seasoned the same way as adults. What may be bland to you is a whole new taste sensation for your baby.
Trim fat and remove skin and bones from meat before cooking.

, Steaming, baking and roasting are the best methods for preparing baby food. This will help the food retain as many nutrients as possible.


When steaming, use a steamer with the food out of the water or a pot with a steamer basket and cook until tender. Be sure not to overcook food because it will deplete its nutritional value.

, Puree’ the food in a food processor or blender with infant formula or breast milk to thin out.


For younger babies, puree’ very well and strain through a fine mesh strainer to help avoid choking accidents. The younger the baby, the more the food will need to be thinned with breast milk or formula.
You may consider adding a small amount of orange juice to fruits for the vitamin C. Vitamin C helps with iron and calcium absorption. Other than some orange juice in the fruit, avoid citrus until the baby is at least 1 year old and their bodies can handle the acidity.
Remove any excess fat from meats before pureeing. Meats and fish should be roasted and the internal temperature should be checked with a meat thermometer before further processing. The internal temperature should be at least 165 degrees F (73.9 degrees C).

, Without freezing, fruits and vegetables can be refrigerated for 48 hours and meats can be refrigerated for 24 hours.


To freeze the food, pour it into an ice tray and cover with plastic wrap to keep contaminants out. Place in the freezer until it has frozen completely through. Ice trays work well because they hold approximately 3 to 5 tbsp. of food in case compartment, and individual servings can be thawed easily and quickly.
Once the food has frozen, remove from the ice tray and place in a freezer bag. Be sure to label the bag with date and contents.
Baby food can be frozen for up to one month.

, Baby food should be thawed by leaving it in the refrigerator and not by leaving it out on the counter. Fruit and vegetables should be used within 48 hours after thawing and meats should be used within 24 hours after thawing.

Use your breast pump as directed until your milk comes in.,
Have your lactation consultant show you and your partner how to encourage a proper latch.,
If it doesn't work, have your committed partner feed the bottle so that the baby associates your breast with receiving food.",How to Pump a Year's Worth of Breast Milk for a Baby Who Can't Latch1," Before your milk comes in, just five minutes of pumping will bring a big benefit. Before pumping, have a cheap wide-mouth bottle handy containing 2 oz. of colostrum, purchased or donated breast milk, or infant formula.;
, Pump until you see the first drop of colostrum, then patiently offer the breast to your baby.


Just snuggling with your baby will encourage milk production, and you may be surprised to find that breastfeeding works once your nipple has been ""primed"" by the pump.

, Pump up to 20 minutes.

"
"
Once your milk comes in, begin single pumping both breasts consecutively.,
When you start pumping a breast, use your free hand to massage any hard spots, which could be plugged ducts that need to be emptied.

,
Before you finish pumping a breast, massage and squeeze it for the last couple of minutes.,
But if it looks like it's not going to work out, then give away your cheap wide-mouth bottles and buy some fancy standard bottles.",How to Pump a Year's Worth of Breast Milk for a Baby Who Can't Latch2,"


Put one breast shield on your more productive breast and pump it until it's empty or for up to 20 minutes, then pump the less productive breast for at least the same amount of time. ""Empty,"" means that you pump for a minute (some experts say two) without getting any drops.
Devices designed to hold breast shields onto your breasts may allow you to pump enough to relieve engorgement, but they won't empty most breasts because they can't create the snug fit you get from holding the shield to your breast with one hand.

,, You may be surprised at how much extra milk you are able to work out of the breast. (This is why babies instinctively grab at the breast or bottle while they nurse.) Lactation consultants will warn you that single pumping reduces your supply, but what they are saying is that it reduces the effect of nipple stimulation on your supply.


Consider this: single pumping allows you to get more suction out of the machine, single pumping leaves a hand free to massage and squeeze your breast, and single pumping allows you to use a remote control, read a book, eat a sandwich, or rock your baby in a swing. Only single-pumping will keep you sane for the marathon ahead.

Hopefully, your baby will begin to latch easily and you will not need the rest of these instructions.



, You can find bottles that help protect your breast milk from deteriorating in the bottle. Standard nipples are important because wide-mouth bottles can leave up to an ounce in the nipple that your baby can't reach from a comfortable feeding position.

"
"
Once you establish pumping and are getting enough milk to feed your baby, your committed partner can tend to other responsibilities.,
You want to stick to established pumping intervals, plus or minus 20 minutes or so.",How to Pump a Year's Worth of Breast Milk for a Baby Who Can't Latch3,"


Now, if your baby needs your attention while you are pumping, go ahead and stop pumping to take care of him/her and go back to pumping when you can. It's frustrating at first but it's important not to wait until you are sure you have 15-40 minutes free to pump. Babies are unpredictable and you may not get many times like that.

, Any more variation than that and your breasts will spend some time full telling your body not to pump.

"
"
Start stretching the capacity of your breasts by gradually increasing pumping intervals.",How to Pump a Year's Worth of Breast Milk for a Baby Who Can't Latch4," If you start to see your total daily supply go down too much, leave the intervals where they are. You can even simulate a ""growth spurt"" by pumping very frequently for a day or two. If you're lucky, your breasts will respond by permanently increasing production.

"
"
Familiarize yourself with guidelines for storing your breast from the CDC site listed under Sources and Citations.,
When you have enough fresh milk on hand, pump some milk to freeze.,
To freeze milk, first lay the bag flat in your regular freezer.",How to Pump a Year's Worth of Breast Milk for a Baby Who Can't Latch5,"


Ignore the American Academy of Pediatrics. Their advice would have you pouring most of your breast milk down the drain in the name of maximizing nutrition per swallow. Your lucky baby is getting milk much more easily thanks to those fancy standard bottles.
If the quality of the milk is diminished 2% because you followed the CDC guidelines instead of the AAP, your baby will more than make up for it by being able to drink much more milk with the same amount of effort as a breast-fed baby.

, You can pump directly into your standard size bottles (that's why they're called standard) or into bags that you attach to the bottles with a rubber band.


When you once struggled to give your baby a full 2 oz. meal, it can be exciting to fill a bag to bursting with 10 oz. or more. But when it comes time to thaw, you'll wish you had two smaller bags. You'll probably be happiest with bags of 6 oz. or less.

, This way, you'll be storing a flat rectangle instead of a lumpy bag. When it's time to freeze another bag, transfer your newly frozen bag to a shoebox or similar container in the back of the freezer.

"
"
Keep gradually reducing your pumping time until you find a balance that works for you.

,
Once you've got a long-term pumping routine, make a goal for getting out of it!,
Keep a running tally of your supply on hand.,
When each shoebox fills up, store it at the bottom of the freezer.,
While you are pumping, don't try to use thawed milk before it gets too ""old."",
Don't offer frozen milk until you've stopped pumping fresh, with these exceptions:


First, if you run out of fresh milk or something is wrong with your supply, thawed breast milk is much better than formula.,
Once your freezer is full, space your pumping even further apart.",How to Pump a Year's Worth of Breast Milk for a Baby Who Can't Latch6,", If you are pumping 40 oz. a day, you will make an extra day's supply in 2-4 days. That means that you could quit when your child is eight months old and still have enough milk to feed him/her until she is old enough for cow's milk. Wet nurses often fed six babies, so it is probable that a dedicated woman whose baby had a small appetite could lay in a year's supply in two months.

, It will be easy to remember to do this! You can use a notebook stored near your breast pump.

, This means that it will be hard to rotate stock but also that the bags that need to last the longest will be kept the coldest. Weigh the box, subtract 8 oz., and add that figure to your running tally of supply on hand.

, Milk placed at the bottom of a chest freezer when your child is one week old will be safe there on his/her first birthday. You may have heard that breast milk adjusts perfectly for a child's age, but this is only true for the first few weeks. After that, you have what is called ""mature milk,"" which varies more with your diet than your baby's age. Fresh milk is slightly better quality, which is more important when your baby is young.

,
Second, you may want to offer thawed milk once in a while to make sure your baby stays accustomed to the taste.
Finally, if you come close to running out of freezer space, you can start thawing the oldest milk to supplement your fresh supply, and freezing only enough to replace it. What you're doing here is making your younger baby deal with slightly degraded frozen milk so that your older baby gets slightly higher quality. You may just want to leave your freezer full of the old milk and stop pumping when you think you have enough to last out the year.

, Many women continue to produce milk nursing just once a day. Nonetheless, you'll want to continue increasing your intervals slowly. If your supply drop below your baby's appetite, you'll have the best chance to correct the problem if you haven't made big changes.

"
"
Keep pumping (and freezing, if space allows) until you have an adequate supply.,
Talk to your midwife or physician about how to quit pumping.,
When you have no more fresh milk, very quickly pull all your shoe boxes out of your freezer, laying them out in order of when you filled them.,
If you end up with extra milk to sell or donate, make sure to mention in your offer that you had to pump every drop for your baby and still fed him an entire year's worth of breast milk.",How to Pump a Year's Worth of Breast Milk for a Baby Who Can't Latch7," Your baby's daily intake of milk changes three times in the first year: it ramps up in the first month or so of life, stays at the same high amount until solid foods are introduced, then drops to a steady amount, at least twenty ounces a day, once your baby gets accustomed to complimentary foods. If you are lucky enough to freeze 3,640 ounces (twenty ounces a day for 182 days) by the time your baby is six months old, don't assume your baby will only want 20 ounces. Instead, wait until your baby is taking two small meals of solid foods per day. Then calculate an adequate supply for the rest of the year as follows: (52 - your baby's age in weeks) x bottles offered per day x size of bottles x 7 = adequate supply.

, Either you'll go cold turkey or you'll pump to relieve engorgement but try to leave the breasts full. Your level of production, pumping history, susceptibility to mastitis, and tolerance for leaks and discomfort will all play a part in forming your plan to stop producing milk.

, Quickly put them back in reverse order, with the newest boxes at the bottom of your freezer. Pull out your first bag and place it in cool water in the refrigerator. It will thaw faster in contact with water than air, but just as safely.

, Only sell or give your milk to mothers who recognize what an awesome sacrifice you've made for your baby's comfort and health. Congratulations!

Put a bib on your child.,
Lay newspapers around your child's eating area.,
Use sippy cups and bowls that attach to the table.,
Make the food easy to eat.,
Reduce the amount of food they can throw at one time.,
Have meals outside.",How to Reduce Toddler Food Throwing Messes1," A bib can prevent you from having to re-clean clothes because of messes created when eating. Make it a habit of putting a bib on your toddler before every meal.There are a variety of different bib types that are available at department stores or online. Feeding bibs are larger and are specifically made to keep messy toddlers clean. Bibs can come in plastic or machine washable cloth.There are long-sleeved bibs that are great for finicky toddlers who take off their bib often.
Consider getting a waterproof bib.
Compare different bibs and find one that fits your toddler the best.;
, If your child is prone to throwing food, newspapers or plastic mats can prevent the food from getting all over the floor and will make cleanup easier. Lay these down under their child seat before your put food in front of your toddler.You can also use bed sheets, towels, fabric or disposable tablecloths, large trash bags, or other similar items.

, Find bowls and plates that have suction cups on the bottom of them. This will prevent your child from lifting up their plate or bowl and creating a mess. Sippy cups will prevent liquids from spilling, even if your toddler throws their drink., Toddlers will be able to eat things like chicken fingers, fish sticks, or small pancakes with their hands.Sometimes food throwing is derived from frustration because of the difficulty toddlers have using utensils.Think of foods that won't create as much of a mess, such as buttered noodles instead of noodles with sauce.

, The less food your toddler has on their plate, the less of a mess it will create if they decide to throw their food. As they finish eating the portion you give them, give them more until they are full. This will also cut down on food waste if they throw their entire plate or bowl.

, If the weather is nice, consider eating outside with your toddler. This will limit the amount of mess that they can create inside of your house, and will limit the amount of food that you'll have to clean.

If the date has passed, discard the formula. Babies' immune systems are not as robust as adults', so they are more susceptible to food-borne illnesses that may be present in expired formula.If you have an unopened, expired can of baby formula at home, many stores will allow you to return it for a free replacement.
If you're feeding your baby breast milk, you should always label it with the date that you pumped the milk to ensure that it is not too old to be used. Breast milk can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours and in the freezer for up to six months.;
, As you're shopping for formula, check each container carefully to make sure it is not damaged in any way. Even small defects to the packing can allow harmful bacteria to grow in the formula.


Although a small dent may not seem like a big deal, it can cause the formula to spoil if the inner layer of the can is damaged.If your formula comes in pouches, do not purchase or use any pouch that is swelling or leaking., Your hands can carry lots of potentially harmful bacteria, so always wash them thoroughly before handling your baby's bottle. Household surfaces like counter tops can also harbor bacteria, so be sure to clean the surface on which you will be preparing the bottle before you begin., Before using a bottle or nipple for the first time, sterilize it in boiling water for at least five minutes. You should then thoroughly clean each component using soap and water or in the dishwasher before each subsequent use.You can also buy a special sterilizer for cleaning baby bottles. Some experts recommend that you sterilize feeding supplies before each use., If you are using a formula that you need to add water to, it's a good idea to sterilize the water before mixing the bottle. You can do this by boiling the water for five minutes. Then let the water cool for no more than 30 minutes before mixing the bottle.Don't use water that has previously been boiled and cooled.
Avoid artificially softened water, as it may contain too much sodium.
Bottled water is not always sterile, so you should boil it just as you would tap water.
If you use boiled water to make your baby bottles, be sure to let it cool down enough after mixing so that it will not scald your baby. You can check the temperature of the formula by squeezing a small amount on to the inside of your wrist.
If your bottled water indicates that it is sterile, you do not need to boil water prior to mixing., Start preparing your bottle by pouring the desired amount of sterilized water into a clean bottle. If you are unsure of how much water to add, consult the instructions on the packaging to determine a correct serving size.Always add the water before the powder. This will help ensure that you measure properly.

, Consult the formula packaging to determine how much powder you should add to the water. You should find a ratio of scoops of formula to ounces of water on the packaging. All formulas are different.Always use the scoop that was provided with the container of formula to measure out the powder. You do not need to pack the formula into the scoop; simply fill it loosely and level it off using a clean knife or a leveling tool (if one was provided with the formula).
It is very important that you add the correct amount of powdered formula to your baby's bottle. Adding too much can cause your baby to become dehydrated, and adding too little can cause your baby to become malnourished.

, Once you have added both the water and the powder to the bottle, place the nipple, ring, and cap on the bottle. Make sure it is closed securely, and then shake the bottle vigorously. Once the powder has fully dissolved, the bottle is ready to serve or store., There are two different kinds of liquid formula available: concentrated and ready-to-use. Read the packaging carefully in order to determine which type of liquid formula you have. This is very important, as you will need to add water if your formula is concentrated., Regardless of which type of liquid formula you are using, it's a good idea to shake the container before pouring the formula into the bottle. This will help ensure that the formula is fully mixed and not settled., After you have shaken the container thoroughly, open it and pour the desired amount of liquid formula into a clean bottle.Remember that if you are using concentrated formula, you will be adding water, so you will want to pour less formula into the bottle. The container should provide instructions regarding how much formula to use for various serving sizes.
If you do not use the entire container for your bottle, close the container and store it in the refrigerator. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for storing time.

, If you are using concentrated formula, you will need to dilute it with sterilized water before serving it to your baby. All formulas are different, so read the packaging instructions carefully to determine how much water you should add.If the formula is labeled as ready to drink or ready-made, do not add water.

, Once you have added the formula and the water (for concentrated formula only) to the bottle, attach the nipple, ring, and cap to the bottle. Be sure that everything is securely fastened, and then shake the bottle to mix the contents together. The bottle is now ready to serve or store., If you will be feeding your baby breast milk, but will be unable to breastfeed, you will need to express your breast milk ahead of time and store it until feeding time. If you will only be doing this occasionally, you may wish to express your breast milk manually.Do this by placing your thumb just above your areola and two fingers slightly below the nipple. Then apply pressure towards your rib cage and roll your fingers towards the nipple.
You can capture the milk in the bottle you will be using for feeding, or in a separate container. If you will be storing the milk, be sure to keep it in a covered container in the refrigerator.

, If you will be using bottles often, you will probably want to use a breast pump to express your milk. This will make expressing your milk much faster.Breast pumps are available in both manual and electric varieties.
Most breast pumps come with bottles or other containers that can be attached directly to the pump for easy collection.Always read the instructions to ensure that you are using your breast pump correctly.
You may be able to rent a breast pump if you don't want to buy one.
Be sure to clean the breast pump before using it.

, If you used a different container to collect the milk than you will be using to feed your baby, pour the milk into the bottle. Then attach the nipple and screw the bottle closed. If you will be storing the bottle, put a cap on it and place it in the refrigerator.

, Heating bottles is not necessary, but some parents choose to do it because their babies prefer warm bottles. There is nothing wrong with serving your baby a bottle that is cool or room temperature, as long as the baby will drink it.Don't leave formula out of the refrigerator for more than two hours.Breast milk can be safely kept at room temperature for up to six hours, although it's best to refrigerate it within four hours., If you choose to warm the bottle, one easy way to do it is to place it in a bowl of warm water for several minutes. The water should be very warm, but not hot.Place the bottle in the center of the bowl, making sure the height of the water is about the same as the height of the milk or formula.

, If you want an even easier way to warm your baby's bottle, you can purchase an electric bottle warmer. To use a bottle warmer, simply place the bottle in the device and turn it on. It will take about four to six minutes to heat the bottle.You can also purchase small, battery-operated bottle warmers to use while traveling.

, Another way to warm a bottle is to hold it under the faucet for several minutes. Make sure the water is warm, but not hot enough to scald you., While it may seem tempting to simply heat your baby's bottle in the microwave, you should avoid doing this at all costs. Microwaves do not heat evenly, so they may create hot spots that can scald your baby's mouth., No matter how you decide to heat your bottle, it's always a good idea to confirm that the contents are an appropriate temperature before you give it to your baby. To do so, hold the bottle upside down and sprinkle a few drops of milk onto your wrist. The milk should feel neither cold nor hot.If the milk is a comfortable temperature, you can go ahead and give the bottle to your baby.
If it is too hot, allow it to cool before feeding the baby.
If the milk feels cold, continue warming the bottle until it is lukewarm.

, The best way to keep bottles free from contaminants is to prepare them on an as-needed basis. If possible, do not mix extra bottles ahead of time and store them for future use.If you must store a bottle, store it near the back of the refrigerator, where the temperature remains the coldest., If you need to store bottles of breast milk for future use, you can typically store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. If you will not use the milk within 24 hours, you may freeze it in a plastic container with a lid or a breast milk bag.If your baby has been hospitalized, be sure to follow your doctor's recommendations regarding storing breast milk, as it may not be advised.
If you are using a regular freezer that is attached to a refrigerator, store breast milk frozen for no more than one month. If you are using a deep freezer, you may store it for three to six months. The longer you leave it frozen, the more likely the nutrients in the milk are to degrade, so use it as soon as possible.
Thaw frozen milk in the refrigerator, or place it in a bowl of warm water. Once it has thawed, do not refreeze it.
Labeling milk with the date is a good idea, as it will prevent you from accidentally using milk that has been stored for too long.

, Liquid formula, both concentrated and ready-to-use, can typically be stored in the container in the refrigerator for 24-48 hours. Storage instructions may vary for different brands of formula.Always read and follow the storage directions on the container. If the manufacturer recommends storing formula in the refrigerator for a maximum of 24 hours, don't store it for any longer.

, Extreme heat and cold can degrade baby formula, so try to store your containers of powered formula somewhere where the temperature will consistently be between 55 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep it away from direct sunlight and heating and cooling vents.Once a can of powdered formula has been opened, it's best to use the contents of the can within one month.

, If you will be out when your baby needs to be fed, you can make it easy to prepare a powdered formula bottle on the go. Simply boil and cool your water ahead of time and place it in a sealed bottle. Then measure out the appropriate amount of powdered formula and store this in a separate sterile container. When it's time to feed the baby, empty the powder into the bottle and shake.Make sure to wash your hands before mixing the bottle.
If you will be outside and the weather will be hot, then you may want to place both the bottle and the container of powdered formula in a cooler bag with a small, towel-wrapped ice pack. Remember that you do not want to make the water or formula cold, you just want to prevent it from becoming hot.
Storing the water and powder separately is preferable to storing pre-mixed powder formula because the powder may separate and clump during storage.

, If your baby doesn't finish a bottle within an hour, throw it out instead of saving it for a future feeding. This applies whether you are feeding breast milk or formula. The bacteria in your baby's mouth can get inside the bottle and grow while the bottle is stored in the refrigerator. This can sicken your baby later on."

Redirect your child's attention.,
Understand the behavior of your child at their age.,
Encourage eating by doing it in front of them.,
Make sure that your child is still hungry.",How to Reduce Toddler Food Throwing Messes2," Make eating a game or activity. This will increase the likelihood that your toddler will eat during mealtime instead of throwing their food. Challenge the child to use child-safe forks and spoons correctly, or ask them to name all the different kinds of food in their plate.You can say something like, ""How many broccoli are on your plate?""

, From infancy to 12 months old, your child won't have the cognitive skills to not make a mess. If they throw food, there's a chance they aren't acutely aware of what they are doing yet. Between 15 and 18 months, however, children start to develop more sophisticated reasoning skills and can typically understand simple commands to not to throw food.Do not get too frustrated with a younger toddler, because they may not know what they are doing.
If your child is 2 years old or older and is throwing food, there's a good chance they are not hungry.

, If you eat the food on your toddler's plate, they are more likely to mirror your behavior and eat the food in front of them. Say something like, ""Yum, these peas are so good!"" while eating a spoonful of peas off their plate. This may encourage them to eat instead of throwing food., Many children won't start throwing food until they are full and have become bored. If your child has already eaten and is throwing food, there's a good chance they are restless. Instead of getting angry, end the meal and let the child play."
"
Limit the amount of food that you put on their plate.,
End the meal if the food throwing gets out of hand.,
Set rules and limits on your toddler.,
Reward positive behavior.",How to Reduce Toddler Food Throwing Messes3," A lot of food in your child's plate may overwhelm them, which could lead to food throwing. Instead of piling food on your child's bowl or plate, regulate the amount of food you are serving out each time, and add more once they clear their plate., If the child is not listening to you and continually throws food or drops their plate on the floor, end the meal. Once the toddler understands the consequences of their actions, they may stop throwing food.If you are worried that your toddler didn't get enough to eat, you can give them a healthy snack later.

, When your child starts to throw food, it's important to make them aware of the rules even if they don't fully understand what you are saying. Tell your child not to do it and ask them if they are still hungry before ending the meal.Say things like ""Are you done?"" or ""Not hungry anymore?"" when your child starts throwing food.

, Give your toddler positive feedback when there is a successful meal that's free of food-throwing. Don't give too much attention or negative reinforcement when they throw food, or else they could perceive the attention as a reward.You can say ""Great job Henry! You had a great meal and you didn't throw any of your food.""
Affordable rewards like stickers or fruit snacks are also great tangible rewards for your toddler.

Put a small amount of baby cereal into a bowl.,
Add a little liquid to the cereal.,
Mix the cereal and the liquid together thoroughly.,
Serve the cereal.,
Thicken the cereal over time.,
Offer more cereal to your baby over time.",How to Mix Baby Cereal1," Once you've chosen a baby cereal (like rice cereal), put about 1 tablespoon (2.5 g) of it into a bowl. You'll want to start with a small amount.Since you'll be feeding your baby with a spoon and dipping it into the cereal bowl, you'll introduce bacteria that could grow over time. This is why you shouldn't store and reuse prepared cereal.;
, Pour about 4 to 5 tablespoons (60 to 75 ml) of liquid into the cereal in the bowl. You should use either breast milk or baby formula, depending on what your baby is used to.If you don't have breast milk or baby formula, you can use water as long as it is clean and fresh.

, Stir the liquid into the cereal so the mixture becomes very runny, like melted ice cream. Remember that your baby's reflexes may make them gag on anything that's too thick. If the cereal doesn't look runny enough, add another tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid., Once the cereal is thin, you can serve it. You don't need to heat or sweeten the cereal before you offer it to your baby, but your baby may refuse the cereal if it's very cold. To warm cereal made with formula or water, just microwave it at half power for about 15 seconds. Always stir and check the temperature before offering it to your baby.Avoid microwaving cereal made with breast milk, since this can break down nutrients in the breast milk. If you need to warm up the breast milk, place the breast milk in a bag and set it under warm, running water for a few minutes. Then you can stir it into the baby cereal.

, Cut back on the amount of liquid you use after a couple of weeks, once you can determine that your baby's ability to swallow has improved. Reduce the amount of liquid you add to the cereal by 1 tablespoon (15 ml) every few weeks until you are using equal parts liquid and cereal.

, By six to eight months, your baby can eat anywhere from 3 to 9 tablespoons (7.5 to 22.5 g) of baby cereal throughout the day. This amount can be stretched between two to three feedings.


Remember that your baby should still be getting their primary nutrients from breast milk or formula.

Decide when to offer fruits and vegetables.,
Choose a single fruit or vegetable puree.,
Mix the cereal with the usual formula or breast milk.,
Stir in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pureed fruit or vegetable.,
Introduce a combination of fruits and vegetables with the cereal.",How to Mix Baby Cereal2," Your baby should be used to eating cereal mixed with formula, breast milk or water before you begin mixing fruit or vegetable purees into the cereal. Most babies can start enjoying fruits and vegetables within a few weeks after starting cereal.


Your baby might enjoy cereal more when it's mixed with fruits or vegetables, since these will give the cereal a little flavor. The fruit and vegetables will also give important nutrients to your baby.

, Always use pureed fruits or vegetables when combining it with cereal. Start with a single fruit or vegetable at a time, so you can watch your baby for allergic reactions (like hives, swelling, or skin irritation). Consider starting with one of these easy-to-digest foods:Avocado
Banana
Sweet potato (cooked and pureed)
Carrots (cooked and pureed)
Pears
Peas (cooked and pureed)

, Combine the usual amount of cereal and formula or breast milk that your baby usually eats. It's alright if the mixture is a little thick, since the fruit or vegetable puree with thin it out a little.


For example, a five month old baby may be eating 2 tablespoons (5 g) of cereal with 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of breast milk or formula.

, The cereal will thin out a little and have a slight fruit or vegetable flavor. You can offer your baby any fruit or vegetable. Keep in mind that your baby might refuse a fruit or vegetable the first time, but may enjoy it the next time you offer it. Some basic starting combinations include:Pumpkin puree with oat or rice cereal
Applesauce with oat or rice cereal
Pureed peas with oat or rice cereal

, Once your baby has tried a variety of fruits and vegetables, you can begin combining them with the cereal. To create a flavorful meal, you can mix a fruit and vegetable into a cereal. You can also increase the amount of puree to one or two tablespoons. Some good flavor combinations include:Pureed peas and carrots with cereal
Pureed green beans and mashed potatoes with cereal
Applesauce, pureed sweet potatoes, and cereal
Mashed banana, pureed pears and cereal
Carrot puree, applesauce, and mango puree with cereal

Talk with your pediatrician about baby cereal.,
Wait before introducing new baby cereals.,
Offer cereal after feeding your baby.,
Follow your baby's lead.",How to Mix Baby Cereal3," Once your baby is 6 months old, you can talk with the pediatrician about introducing baby cereal. Fortified baby cereal is a good source of iron, which your baby might begin needing at this point.The doctor should give you specific recommendations about how much cereal to offer and how often you should give it.

, Many babies start with single grain baby cereals, usually made with rice. If your baby enjoys rice cereal, you can also offer oat, barley, or wheat cereals. Always wait three days after introducing a new food before offering another new food. This can help you identify any food allergies or sensitivities.If three days pass with no reaction, you can safely assume that your baby does not have an allergy to the food you tried. Move to the next food, mixing it into the cereal at the same proportion and without another fruit or vegetable.

, Feed your baby a little breast milk or formula before you offer them baby cereal. Before your baby is finished eating, offer the baby cereal. Your baby will be more interested in the cereal if they're not completely full or hungry for milk.Once your baby is done eating cereal, you can offer more breast milk or formula.

, If your baby seems disinterested in eating baby cereal from a small spoon, try offering a little bit of cereal on the end of your clean finger. If your baby still seems uninterested (cries or turns away), don't force them to eat. Your baby might prefer milk or formula for now.You can always take a break from baby cereal and offer it again in another week or so.
Consider making feeding a game. Try flying the spoon around like it's an airplane. Your baby might be so interested in the game, that they'll try the food on the spoon.

Or, serve cut fruit and yogurt on the side for dipping.

, Eat together as a family, if possible. Turn the TV off so the child doesn’t get distracted. Make sure toddlers aren’t eating snacks or drinks high in sugar in between meals, which can fill them up before mealtime. If there are foods the child is refusing to eat, try disguising them with other foods.Toddlers typically go through fussy eating stages, where they refuse certain foods or meals. If the child is at a normal height and weight and seems healthy, this is probably just a normal part of growing up.
Children tend to eat healthier foods when the whole family is eating together.For example, mash vegetables in with potatoes, or serve minced meat in with a sauce or gravy.

Sometimes, they can show up as quickly as a few minutes after your baby starts eating a certain food, if your child is particularly sensitive to it.Symptoms make take days to show up.;
, One symptom of a food allergy is a red skin rash, commonly known as hives. Usually, hives create welts on the skin. The outer edges of the welts are red, while the centers are usually white or pink. You may notice the baby trying to scratch these areas, as they can be itchy. They can show up anywhere on the baby's skin.Food allergies cause the body to release histamine, which in turn can cause hives.

, Other skin problems can also indicate an allergic reaction. One common symptom, for instance, is eczema.Eczema generally shows up as redness and scaly skin. You may notice your kid trying to scratch it. In addition, it sometimes produces blisters., Another common skin indicator of a food allergy is swelling skin. You may notice your baby's lips swelling, for instance. This symptom, in conjunction with other symptoms, likely indicates a food allergy. Also watch for symptoms like a swelling tongue., Another symptom of a food allergy is your child having stomach problems every time they eat a certain food. If your child vomits every time they have strawberries, for instance, that could indicate a food allergy or food intolerance., Like vomiting, diarrhea can be a sign that your baby is having stomach issues. In turn, that could mean your child has a food allergy to a particular food. Make sure to note what foods your baby ate if they have diarrhea, so you can determine what might be the cause., Other symptoms can indicate stomach issues, though they aren't as obviously stomach problems as diarrhea or vomiting. Both of these symptoms are serious symptoms of a food allergy.Blood in the stool may also indicate a milk allergy.

, A more serious allergy can cause problems with your baby's breathing. You may notice your baby is wheezing, for instance. Sneezing can also be a symptom of an allergy, as can other breathing problems., Infants can’t tell you about their symptoms, but they may act fussy or irritable as a result of their symptoms. If you notice that your infant is fussy or irritable and you can’t figure out why, then it may be due to allergy symptoms., There are other serious allergy symptoms that require immediate medical attention. For instance, you may notice your baby suddenly going pale, or they might lose consciousness.If this happens, seek immediate medical help., Up to 7 percent of infants have trouble digesting milk proteins. People of any age can have a milk allergy, but it's more common in infants. About 2 to 3% of infants have a milk allergy, and up to 7% have some form of intolerance. Generally, it's the proteins in the milk that the baby is allergic to, so pay attention to how your baby reacts to milk, particularly when you start feeding them formula.Keep in mind that your baby having issues with formula could be due to something else besides an allergy or intolerance, such as not mixing up the formula in the right ratio. Feeding the baby too much or acid reflux can also cause issues.

, Some babies have allergies to foods with gluten, such as foods with rye, wheat, and barley. If you're starting to feed your baby cereals, for instance, you may notice an intolerance due to gluten., Another common category of food allergy is tree nuts and peanuts. Peanuts, in particular, are becoming a more common allergy. Nuts are incorporated into many foods, so it can be difficult to isolate this allergy, particularly if it's severe. Some babies may have a reaction even if their food just came in contact with a nut or peanut., Eggs and soy are also common allergens that are in many foods. These foods may be harder to isolate, particularly soy, because of how common they are. However, reading labels can help you determine if one of these foods is what your baby is allergic to., Seafood is another common allergen. Fish such as salmon, tuna, and cod and shellfish such as shrimp, lobster, and crab can all cause an allergic reaction in your baby. Keep an eye out if you start feeding your baby these foods., If you notice your child is having trouble breathing or is losing consciousness or a sudden escalation of symptoms, call emergency services right away. Your baby's airway could close up, and if you try to drive them yourself to the emergency room, it may be too late., Your child's doctor can assess whether your child has an allergy or the root cause is something else. In addition, the doctor can help you come up with a course of action moving forward, so you can keep your child safe and healthy.An allergist can perform a skin or blood test to determine what allergies your baby might have.

, Before your baby turns 6 months of age, it's best to avoid the foods that commonly cause allergies in babies. When you do introduce these foods, try bringing them into the baby's diet one at a time, so you can see if any of them trigger a reaction., One way to help determine what is causing your baby issues is to start eliminating common culprits one by one from their diet. For instance, you might start by taking cow's milk out of your child's diet. If they're still having problems, try another common allergen, such as gluten. Keep eliminating foods until your baby stops showing symptoms, and you have your culprit.You should only try food elimination under advice of a doctor.
If you're breastfeeding, your doctor may suggest that you start eliminating foods from your diet.
Once you figure out which food is causing the allergy, avoid the food. The main course of action for a food allergy is to eliminate the food from the baby's diet altogether. Your doctor can help you come up with alternatives for the food if it's something common, such as formula. When eliminating foods, keep in mind that you'll need to read labels carefully to check for the allergen., If your child has a severe allergy, such as a peanut allergy, then it's probably not a great idea to try the food again. However, a mild intolerance, such as gassiness after eating a food, may disappear, as babies often lose their intolerances over time. With a mild intolerance, it's fairly safe to try the food again in a couple of months to see if your baby reacts to it, though you should always talk to the pediatrician first.Know the difference between an allergy and an intolerance. A food allergy affects the child's immune system, which is what makes it more severe. A food intolerance, on the other hand, only affects your baby's digestive system. Food allergies are not as common as food intolerances., You may feed your baby a food for weeks without any problems, and suddenly, they may start having symptoms related to that food. Just because you've fed your baby a food in the past doesn't mean they haven't developed an allergy to it more recently., If your baby is having severe reactions, your doctor may recommend that you keep epinephrine pens on hand in case your baby goes into anaphylaxis, a severe form of an allergic reaction. An epinephrine pen can help save your baby if they do have this reaction.Anaphylaxis is characterized by severe allergic reaction symptoms, including trouble breathing, loss of consciousness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting, and becoming pale or limp.Even if you use an epi pen, you still need to call emergency services if your child goes into anaphylaxis.

Supplement with other dairy products.",How to Transition a Baby to Cow's Milk," Babies under twelve months old cannot digest cow’s milk properly. In addition, they require the particular mix of nutrients that breast milk and formula provide; cow’s milk is not an adequate substitute. Therefore, wait until your child turns one before you introduce cow’s milk.;
, In most cases, you can begin transitioning to cow’s milk at any point after your baby’s first birthday; however, it’s always best to check in with your baby’s doctor. He or she may have specific guidelines for you.

, Milk is an important source of nutrition for young children. It is rich in vitamin D, calcium, proteins, and fats that are crucial for the growth of your child and the development of his or her bones. To maximize these benefits, offer your child whole milk, not low-fat or non-fat milk, at least until his or her second birthday.

, Once your baby is a year old, he or she should be eating a variety of nutritious solid foods – fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and proteins. As long as this is the case, you don’t need to rely on cow’s milk as the major source of nutrition as you did with breast milk or formula when your baby was younger. Two glasses of milk a day should be sufficient, especially if your child eats other forms of dairy, such as yogurt and cheese.


Keep in mind that you shouldn’t jump from no cow’s milk at all to two full glasses of cow’s milk a day. Introducing milk gradually is actually better.

, Cow’s milk does not taste exactly like breast milk or formula, so your baby may refuse it at first. If this happens, don’t worry; in time, he or she will learn to accept it. For strategies, scroll down to Part 2.

, Milk is a fairly common allergen. As with other foods, you should pay attention when you introduce it and note any adverse reactions. Babies with milk allergies or lactose intolerance may vomit, have diarrhea, show signs of abdominal pain, or develop a rash. If you suspect that your baby is not tolerating cow’s milk well, talk to your pediatrician.

, Your baby will be more likely to accept cow’s milk if he or she is not continually fed with breast milk or formula. There’s no need to make an abrupt change: you can transition gradually, eliminating one feeding at a time and replacing it with cow’s milk.

, Encourage your child to drink milk by limiting the amount of juice he or she drinks. Sugary beverages should be avoided completely at this stage.

, If your baby refuses to drink cow’s milk, try mixing it into his or her usual drink. Then you can slowly adjust the proportions. For best results, mix when both the breast milk or formula and the cow’s milk are at the same temperature – ideally about 37 °C (99 °F). You can experiment with the ratios, but, for example, you could try:


Combining ¾ of a cup or bottle of formula or breast milk with ¼ cow’s milk for the first week. Your child will not notice a huge difference.
Mixing cow’s milk with formula or breast milk in equal proportions for the second week.
Using ¾ cup of milk to ¼ cup of formula or breast milk for the third week.
Offering pure cow’s milk for the fourth week.

, Sometimes serving milk in a brightly colored new cup can appeal to your baby. And if your baby is still using a bottle, consider transitioning to a cup – he or she may accept cow’s milk more willingly if it’s not served in the vessel associated with breast milk or formula.


Be careful not to fill the cup much, and watch your baby carefully. You don’t want your child to associate cow’s milk with the frustration of repeatedly spilling it all over the place.

, Your baby will accept milk more readily if he or she is rested and happy. Try offering it when he or she first gets up, and offer it as a snack between meals. Hungry babies tend to be cranky.

, If you want to make cow’s milk taste more like formula or breast milk, heat it gently to room temperature (or slightly warmer). Your baby may accept it this way even if he or she refuses to drink it cold.

, Don’t get upset if your baby refuses cow’s milk, and don’t get into a power struggle with your toddler. Be persistent, but keep a relaxed attitude. Keep offering milk at different times of day and in different cups or bottles, and wait for your baby to accept it willingly.

, If your baby drinks the milk, offer plenty of praise and encouragement.

, If your baby rejects cow’s milk at first, try mixing it with foods he or she enjoys – mashed potatoes, cereals, and soups, for example.

, If your baby is not drinking much whole milk, make sure to offer yogurt, cheese, and other dairy products.

Take your time.",How to Trim a Baby's Nails," You will need a baby wash rag, a non-metal emery board, a dry hand towel, and a bowl of warm water. If you want to actually cut the nails, you'll need a baby-safe nail trimmer, too.
, Never try to wrestle a fussy baby.

, This depends on which you plan to trim first., In many cases, gentle filing is enough, and you won't need to cut the nails.



Brand-new babies have such moist fingernails, which often do not clip well. You can use the emery board to file them down until they are hard enough to clip.



, Use baby-safe clippers. Hold the baby's finger or toe pad and gently squeeze to pull the skin away from the nail.

,,, It may take two or three sessions to clip all ten nails!

Understand that the nutrients in most formulas are similar, but their sources can be different.,
Identify lactose in cow's milk formulas.,
Know that some formulas are made from soy.,
Understand the ingredients used in organic formulas.,
Be aware of probiotics used in some formulas.,
Look out for other ingredients that are often included in formulas.",How to Understand the Differences Between Baby Formulas1," All baby formulas are regulated and, in general, every baby formula contains basically the same combination of protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, and minerals, which closely mimic that of human breast milk.


The difference between the formulas is the sources of the proteins and carbohydrates that are used.
There can also be some variation in the sources of the other main components.
Some parents may prefer not to feed their baby a formula that has a particular nutrient source, such as corn syrup, while others have no problem with it.
Since the nutritional value is basically the same for all formulas, knowing about nutrient sources is a useful way to differentiate between baby formulas.;
, Breast milk and formulas made from cow’s milk have the same main carbohydrate, which is lactose.


However, there are lactose-free and soy formulas for babies that are lactose intolerant or being raised as vegans.
These, and other specialty formulas, contain various types of carbohydrates that might include sucrose, modified corn starch, corn maltodextrin, or corn syrup solids.

, Most formulas have cow’s milk as a base and whey and casein are their proteins, but some other formulas are made from plant proteins and have a soy base.


These proteins have a soy protein isolate that is easier for some babies to digest.
Soy-based formulas are often fed to babies who suffer from allergies or digestion troubles when fed formulas with a cow’s milk base.
Vegetable based formulas are also popular with vegans because they want to avoid products that come from animals.

, The ingredients in organic formulas are sourced from organic produce and organic dairy.


These ingredients are obtained without the use of chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, and growth hormones.
Some people believe that organic ingredients are more healthy for developing babies, and limit their exposure to harmful chemicals.

, Probiotic formula is formula that includes good gut flora, microorganisms that are meant to promote healthy digestion and regular bowel movements.


Generally, these formulas are given to babies who suffer from diarrhea or generally weak immune systems.
These bacterial cultures can strengthen the body's immune response and soften stools.

, The regulations for baby formula are strict about the nutrients that must be in the formula in order for the baby to grow and develop properly.


However, these regulations do not restrict the addition of “other ingredients”.
Various brands add these ingredients for various reasons.
One ingredient that is often added is various types of different nucleotides, which are supposed to help with the development of the immune system.
These added ingredients are safe for the baby to consume and may help them develop, but they are more likely a way for the different brands to make their formula stand out.

Notice the characteristics of ready-to-use formulas.,
Learn to identify powdered formulas.,
Realize what is considered a concentrated liquid formula.,
Get familiar with hydrolyzed formula.",How to Understand the Differences Between Baby Formulas2," Ready-to-use formulas are liquid and ready to be poured directly into the baby bottle without being diluted.


These formulas focus on convenience, especially for late night feedings.
Ready-to-use formula is also the most costly type of baby formula.
Because of its volume, ready-to-use formula also require quite a bit of storage space compared to other formula categories.
Another factor to keep in mind with this category is that this category of formula is perishable and will not last long after the container is opened, even when refrigerated.

, Powdered formulas are purchased in powder form, and mixed with water when preparing for feeding.


These formulas need to be measured and thoroughly mixed with the right amount of water when making a bottle for a baby.
Formulas in this category do take a bit more time when preparing a feeding, but several bottles can be made at once and stored in the fridge for later use.
Powdered formula is the least expensive and takes up the least amount of space in the pantry or diaper bag.
One issue with formulas in this category is the possibility that the powder might not get thoroughly mixed with the water in the bottle and clumps will form that can clog the nipple.
Another issue is that there may not be any suitable water available when it is necessary to make a bottle while away from home.

, Concentrated liquid formulas have characteristics of both powdered formula and ready-to-use formula.


Concentrated liquid formulas are in the middle category, being in liquid form, but still requiring additional water prior to serving.
The cost of these formulas is generally between that of the other two categories.
They are easier to mix than the powdered formulas because there is no chance of clumps forming, but there is the chance of leakage when transporting an open container.

, Hydrolyzed formula is formula that contains broken-down proteins that are easier to digest. There are two types of hydrolyzed formulas: partially hydrolyzed and extensively hydrolyzed.


The extensively hydrolyzed formula is intended for babies who have problems with allergies or problems with the digestion of nutrients.
Partially hydrolyzed formula is a formula designed for babies who suffer from colic and have stomach problems. This formula is easily digested because it is made from whey protein.

Push your bed into a corner.,
Check to see if your bed as a black-hole between the headboard and the mattress where your pillows go.,
Tuck your fitted sheets under the corners.,
Move your bed if it is over any vents.The heat or cold can get trapped under the bed and make it uncomfortable for not just the toddler, but you, too.,
Keep breakables out of reach.,
Consider replacing the hand-grip handles with knobs so that toddlers can't climb up on the dresser.,
Keep things around the dresser to distract the child from the contents of the dresser.,
Take care if you have a big closet on the wall without a door but with shelves sitting up on it and a big shower-curtain like pole that holds all the hangers.,
Keep your clothing out of reach.,
Check for all electrical outlets.",How to Toddlerproof Your Bedroom," Toddlers love to stand up on the bed, and having two walls near your bed helps to reduce the possibility of your toddler falling off.;
, If your bed has this, put something in there to prevent the potential for your toddler to get stuck in this gap. It will also stop things from dropping behind the bed, such as the sippy cup or a bottle. No one likes having to scoot the bed around to get the sippy cup out. Use spare pillows or towels to put between the headboard and the mattress.

, This prevents the toddler from crawling under the sheets and getting entangled or potentially suffocating.

, It can also prevent the rest of the room from getting the air circulation that it needs. Catnaps are always happier when the bedroom stays ""temperate"".

, Never put breakable objects in the bottom drawers of your dresser. It's best to keep things that are easy to break or not to be messed with in the higher drawers so that they're out of reach. Try to keep toddler-things in the bottom drawers, such as teddy bears, toys or books, things you feel comfortable with your toddler messing with.


Put breakables at the back of the dresser. This includes knick-knacks and mirrors. Keep breakables away from the edge.

, Toddlers always enjoy climbing, and that isn't always a good thing, especially if they upend the dresser when climbing.

, Consider buying a mini-dresser made out of clear plastic and put all of the toddler's toys and such in it ,so that the child can mess with their own things. Play bins and toy-boxes work, too.

, Toddlers love to yank down the clothes, so be sure to move the pole (if possible) up a notch to keep the clothes out of reach from small hands. If you can't move the pole, when hanging up your clothes, fold them in half, like you do when hanging pants, so that the clothes are still out of reach.

, While it is adorable to see your child prancing out in high heels, it can easily cause them to trip and fall. Instead, keep your stuff out of reach. Put a shelf up for storing your shoes higher up. It'll keep baby from wearing them and scuffing them up, or just plain out ruining them.

, They can be anywhere in the room, and especially near your bedroom TV and bed. The plastic plug-ins are easy for toddlers to pull out, and then they try to plug them back in. If you are not using the electrical outlet, put stuff in front of the outlet. Out of sight, out of mind, right? Put a toy bin in front of them, maybe a chair, love seat, dresser, table, shelf, all that stuff. Also, you can plug in childproof electrical outlet covers for unused outlets.

When you are using the outlet, try not to make it visible. If you have a bunch of wires sticking out of the wall, the toddler may wonder what it is. You can place things in front if it, but not pressed up against it, or else it's a fire hazard. Keep your things plugged in but still try to cover it. For example, if your TV is sitting on a shelf, make the shelf in front of the outlet but leave room for the plug to stretch from the outlet to the TV. You can do this with all the other plugins around the room.

Know when your baby is ready to learn how to sign.,
Watch for signs of increased interest by your baby.,
Pick a limited number of signs to learn first.,
Learn signs by looking them up online.,
Use signs in immediate proximity to an associated action.,
Stick to simple signs.,
Be constant and consistent with your signing.,
Say the corresponding word out loud as you sign.,
Be patient while waiting for your baby to sign back.",How to Teach a Baby Sign Language1," There’s no concern of starting too early, but there is a point at which your baby is better able to start picking up what you’re putting down. The best benchmark is your baby’s ability to sit up without use of their hands. At this point, they are able to begin reading and processing the concept of signing, and may even be able to start copying the signs you make.For some babies, this will occur as early as six months. Many babies will begin reading and using signs at around nine months old.
Look for signs your baby is already making. Chances are, your baby has learned a sign without your intentionally teaching it – most commonly, waving hello or goodbye to people is something babies simply pick up. If this is occurring, take it as a sign your baby will be especially receptive to sign training.;
, Lots of children will begin showing interest in regular things you do. For instance, if they start to coo or wave their arms around whenever you start running the bathwater, recognize that they are excited by the action and are trying to communicate. Know that babies will also want to sign about things they are excited about, in addition to their more basic needs.Take these signs of increased interest as indication that your baby will be receptive to training about how to communicate.

, Before you begin attempting to teach your baby to sign, make a list of the words you would like to teach. Shorten this list by choosing only the words or ideas that would be the most useful to be able to mutually convey to one another. These should be the basic and most important signs, such as ""eat"" and ""drink."", While there are lots of sources of booklets and examples of signs that could work, the most reliable and useful are likely those inspired by American Sign Language (ASL). Michigan State University's online ASL database provides the necessary material to learn more words than you could possibly learn, let alone teach to your baby!You can also make up your own signs, or adapt ASL signs into simpler versions, especially for basic activities such as eating.
For instance, pinch your fingers and thumb together and touch your lips while saying “eat” to sign for eating.

, Practice signs yourself. Be sure you know a sign and are able to execute it clearly before using it with your baby. Once you have it down, start using the sign in front of your baby. Initially, the goal is simply conveying the concept that certain hand signs indicate certain things.Right before you nurse your baby, sign “milk” – or before feeding, sign “eat.”
Sign in the air, on whatever you’re signing, or even right on the baby.
For instance, if signing “milk”, sign with your hand right in front of your breast or bottle.

, You’ll start with the most basic and common parts of your baby’s life, most likely having to do with eating. Expect to incorporate new signs slowly, and keep new signs simple too. Include fun signs and signs for important humans too.It’s especially satisfying to teach your baby a sign for “mom” or “dad.”
Know that no sign is too simple. Even informal gestures that might not even be considered “signs” can provide a helpful way to increase communication with your baby, including simple pointing.

, Use a sign every time the associated action is performed. Eventually, your baby will start to use these signs as well! Don’t stop using a sign your baby has learned. They’ll actually pick up new signs more quickly as they become familiar with the process of learning new signs.The key to helping your baby pick up a new sign is showing them that they can get their needs met by using the sign. Accordingly, be disciplined about always associating signs with the corresponding behavior.

, Conceptualize your signing as a physical emphasis of the word you’re speaking. Your child will eventually transition from signing to speaking, and speaking while signing will help this transition go more smoothly.Know that signing will not postpone or otherwise detrimentally affect your child’s verbal development in anyway.

, It may take months for your baby to make a sign back at you. However, know that a baby’s lack of signing does not mean they are not learning the meaning of the signs and words you’re saying with them. They simply may not be able to perform the physical act of signing yet.Know that your baby is probably trying to sign at you before they’re able to do so.
The ages at which babies are able to physically execute specific signs caries widely. Some babies may not be able to sign until they’re a full year old – this does not indicate slow development in any way whatsoever.
Once your baby begins to sign, they will likely begin to use a flurry of different signs if you’ve been consistently associating different signs with different things.

Imitate your baby.,
Be responsive.,
Show enthusiasm.,
Narrate your day.,
Sing to her.",How to Talk to a Baby1," Some people get nervous when talking to a baby--don't worry, there's not necessarily a right or wrong way. But there are several things you can do to make your conversation enjoyable and effective for both of you. One of the best ways to talk to your baby is to simply repeat what she says.Imitating a baby tells her that what she is trying to say matters to you.
Simply repeat the sounds your baby makes. For example, if she says, ""Ki ki!"", you can say ""Ki ki!"" right back. Use different inflections in your voice to make it feel more like a conversation.
When you repeat the baby's sounds, offer additional encouragement in the form of smiles and a positive tone of voice.;
, When you are talking to a baby, show enthusiasm. Respond in an upbeat tone to whatever noises she makes. If your baby is crying, respond to her vocally. Try saying, ""What's wrong? Are you hungry?""Babies can tell when you are paying attention to them. When your baby is ""talking"" to you, respond.
If your baby is not being vocal, but is looking around or trying to grab for something, you can respond to those cues, too. For example, say, ""Are you looking at your brother? That's your brother, Steve. He's coloring right now.""

, Your baby can interpret your tone of voice, so make it encouraging. When talking to a baby, try to demonstrate enthusiasm. This shows your interest, and that you are engaged with what she's doing.Try offering an exclamation when your baby does something. For instance, you can say, ""Wow, what a big smile! That makes my day!""
Offer encouraging statements to show your enthusiasm. Try ""I'm so glad to be home from work! I'm excited for time with you!"" She might not understand the words, but she will pick up on the sentiment.

, Your baby might not understand everything you do, but the best way for her to learn is by show and tell. Throughout the day, describe your actions to your baby. Say, ""Let's get you dressed and then go eat breakfast!"" After hearing these types of things repeatedly, the meaning will start to sink in.Use descriptive words. You could say, ""It's a good thing we put your hat on. It is cold today. Brrr!""
Experts have not found that baby talk impedes a baby's ability to learn. So feel free to mix in a silly tone or a wacky phrase you like into your narration. Do what feels natural to you, while mixing in adult phrases and words.

, Research shows that babies can detect rhythmic patterns when they are only one day old. That means from almost the moment they are born, music can be an important part of a baby's life. Try singing to your baby to connect with her.Singing and music are comforting to your baby, so try a simple melody if she is fussing.
Singing has also been shown to be beneficial for the language development of a baby. Choose an old favorite like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, or introduce her to your favorite Adele song.

Sign when your baby is paying attention.,
Convey excitement as you sign.,
Start saying “no” to your baby.,
Get others on board with signing.",How to Teach a Baby Sign Language2," There are certain times of the day when your baby will be especially receptive to training. These are mealtime, during baths, and at bedtime. Perhaps unsurprisingly, your baby will be most concerned with eating and drinking when it is very young. Especially while your baby is nursing, use meal time to teach your baby signs.“Milk” is a great first sign to use, because your baby will be especially motivated to learn anything that will indicate its desire for the opportunity to gulp down some nourishment.
Eating also provides a great natural opportunity to increase vocabulary, as your baby’s diet will slowly expand, offering the chance to learn new signs for new foods along the way.
Bath time offers the perfect chance to teach the sign for “toy” or “water.” While these words aren’t associated with needs, they are among those items that will likely greatly interest your baby.

, If you’re bored while your signing or convey signs without emotion or excitement, your baby is much less likely to pay attention. In particular, make a point of acting happily when your baby begins to sign. Even if the signs aren’t decipherable, be visibly excited whenever they’ve seemingly begun to consciously try to make their hands do certain things.Incorporate both facial expressions and body language to convey excitement.
Use every means of expression, including the tone of your voice, to indicate that you are having fun when you are trying to communicate with you baby.

, The concept that you cannot have something is one of the harder ideas to teach to a very young human – for you as a parent and for the baby to learn. However, it’s a vital thing to teach your child. Particularly when your baby learns the sign for an object such as a toy and keeps using the sign all day, take the opportunity to tell them no.


Don’t worry that your saying “no” will discourage them from signing. Your baby will not think you’re talking about their sign-making – if they know the sign means something, they will come to interpret your “no” as a denial of whatever they are signing.

, If a babysitter or other caregiver sometimes performs actions of behaviors that you have signs for, see if they’re willing to use the sign as well, as this will boost your baby’s learning process. Some daycares already use signing with babies that they often care for.Beware the haters. Some people simply don’t realize how smart babies are, and will doubt you baby’s ability to sign. Don’t let this bother you; if they’re willing to listen, explain that at the very least, it’s fun and likely diminishes the baby’s frustration.
Don’t worry about a caregiver that doesn’t sign with your baby. This will not detrimentally affect the baby’s learning process.
Consider leaving a visual booklet of the signs you use with your baby to make it easier for a babysitter to sign too.

Keep expectations realistic.,
Don’t fall for the hype.,
Don’t get spooked if your baby’s signing behavior seems to get de-railed.,
Get more information on baby sign language.",How to Teach a Baby Sign Language3," Know that signing essentially provides a way for babies to express themselves. Especially prior to the development of the verbal skills humans usually rely on to communicate, the inability to convey what you need or what you’re feeling can be incredibly frustrating. By offering a way for your baby to communicate, you will likely reduce the distress they may otherwise feel.If you’re not convinced yourself: It’s a certain fact that babies develop both an understanding of language and their physical motor skills – not to mention the operation of the full operation of their hand muscles – before they are able to speak.

, Stated simply: there are lots of claims made about baby sign language that are not based on anything other than the fact that a lot of websites – and companies – like to repeat the claim. More to the point, signing with your baby has not been proven to accelerate speech development or increase your baby’s intelligence.Further, it is unlikely that your baby will learn from signing videos, despite websites and apps that promote this idea and sell materials that purportedly teach your baby to sign. You baby is far more likely to learn signs from your positive association of certain signs with certain things., Your baby may simply stop signing out of nowhere, or simply use the same sign for all sorts of things. Babies can become entirely focused on certain things – especially the ability to execute a new physical feat like standing, that they will sometimes abandon other energy or attention demanding things like signing.If your baby uses the same sign for different things, don’t worry about it. In fact, this reflects a developmental process similar to that you will observe as your child begins to speak – much like using sounds that are similar before words are completely grasped.
Stay consistent with how you’re signing and they will develop a more nuanced understanding of differences between either signs or concepts that they may associate with one another at first.

, There are plenty of sources of information online that cover how to learn and teach ASL to your baby, as well as more commercially-motivated organizations that sell materials as well. Default to the freely available information provided by organizations who base their materials off of American Sign Language website."

Smile.,
Be patient.,
Use the right tone.,
Show physical affection.,
Listen.",How to Talk to a Baby2," When talking to a baby, your actions are as important as your words. Reinforce what you are saying with appropriate facial gestures. A smile is especially important. Babies understand that it is a positive facial expression.Your baby will likely spontaneously start to smile, especially when she sees people that she recognizes. You can encourage this behavior by smiling at her.
Try playing visual games such as peek-a-boo. When you reveal your face, offer a big smile.

, It's important to remember that everything is new to a baby. She also can't properly vocalize her needs or emotions. It's important to practice patience when talking to any baby and to be kind.Try different remedies. If the baby is fussy, you can try feeding her, changing her, or cuddling her.
Even babies need space. Sometimes your baby might seem to be fussing for no apparent reason. It could be that she is over-stimulated. Be patient, and let her have silence for a while.

, Tone of voice resonates with babies, just as it does with adults. When talking to a baby, the most important thing is to keep your tone warm and happy. This helps reinforce all of the positive things you are saying to her.Research shows that babies respond to the female voice. This is why many people instinctively make their voice sound high-pitched when talking to a baby. This is a perfectly fine way to talk to your baby.
Make your tone cheerful no matter what you are saying. It's fine to say ""Oh, darn! I spilled the milk!"" as long as you say it in an upbeat tone.

, Don't be afraid to shower a baby with kisses. Research tells us that babies who receive a lot of physical affection grow up to have less anxiety. Physical affection can have amazing positive benefits for a baby.In addition to kissing a baby, you can offer gentle hugs and cuddles.
Tickling a baby's tummy or feet is another way to show physical affection.

, Your baby can tell when you are paying attention to her. Demonstrate that you are engaged by showing that you are actively listening. Make eye contact with her when she is verbalizing.Try not to interrupt when your baby is ""talking"". Letting her babble is a great way to encourage the development of her language skills.

"
"
Learn about development.,
Encourage talking.,
Teach new words.",How to Talk to a Baby3," Although your baby reacts to your words and voice almost immediately, it will take a while for her to understand the meaning of individual words. For example, most babies will begin recognizing and responding to their name at about nine months old. At 12 to 15 months, she will begin to process simple requests, such as ""stop"" or ""quiet, please"". Remember, all children develop at different speeds.Many children will not understand multi-step sentences until they are around 3 years old. For example, the phrase ""Pick up your toys and put them away"" is not something that kids will understand during their first couple of years.
Talk to your doctor about your child's individual development.

, One of the best ways to help develop your baby's language skills is to talk to her. She will learn by hearing your words and observing your actions. For example, when you are ready to feed her, say, ""Are you ready to eat your dinner?"" She will begin to understand what these means at around 9 months.At around 12 months, she will probably have a vocabulary of about 20 words. These words will generally be things she is very familiar with, such as ""Mama"" and ""Dada"", and maybe ""milk"".
When she talks, demonstrate that you are listening and engaged. For example, when she asks for milk, say, ""Here is your milk! Thank you for using your words to ask for that!""

, You can help your baby's vocabulary grow by helping her to learn new words. Make this a fun activity. Babies love to play simple games, so turn language into a fun activity for her.For example, make a game out of teaching her the names for parts of her body. You can say, ""Where is Rachel's nose? There's Rachel's nose!"", while you point to her nose and laugh.
Singing is also a great way to teach your baby new words. Rhyming songs can help your baby hear patterns in language. Words with motions are also great, such as ""Wheels on the Bus"".
Reading to your baby is one of the best ways to teach her new words. It's also an excellent way to bond with your baby.

"
"
Help her brain grow.,
Develop her emotions.,
Increase your bond.",How to Talk to a Baby4," Talking to a baby is lots of fun. It's also incredibly important to her development. Some evidence shows that the spoken word is one of the keys to the early learning of a baby. Talking to her will help her learn. Use a combination of words, facial expressions, and actions to show your baby that you are engaged in communicating with her.

, Talking to a baby can help her develop emotionally as well as intellectually. By talking to her, you are demonstrating social skills and human reactions. Listening to you talk introduces your baby to emotions like happiness and excitement.Hearing conversations is the first way a baby can learn about interactions between people.

, Babies are naturally responsive to their mother's voice. That makes sense, since they heard it long before they were born. If you are not the mother, you can increase your bond with the baby by talking to her.By bonding with the baby, you are increasing her sense of safety and security.

Feed your baby smaller but more frequent meals.,
Keep your baby as upright as possible to help their digestion.,
Burp your baby frequently to allow air to escape.,
Keep a food diary of your eating habits if you’re breastfeeding.,
Eliminate irritating foods if you’re breastfeeding.,
Switch to a hydrolysate formula if your baby has milk intolerance.,
Use a fast-flow nipple if you’re bottle-feeding.,
Ensure that your baby has a proper latch if you’re breastfeeding.,
Avoid homeopathic remedies without first consulting your doctor.",How to Treat Colic With Natural Remedies1," Your baby will generally let you know when they’re hungry by smacking their lips, making sucking sounds, or getting fussy. While you never want to ignore these signs, try mixing up your baby’s feeding schedule by feeding them more often and in smaller doses over the course of the day.Most babies under four months will need to nurse or eat at least 8-12 times per day. Colicky babies may need even more frequent sessions to avoid engorging their bellies.;
, Try to position your baby in your arms so that they’re not lying completely flat on their back during and after feedings. Wait at least an hour after they eat to lay them down on their back. This should prevent your baby from spitting up the milk they’ve just eaten., One of the main culprits of colic appears to be air trapped in babies’ bellies. Avoid this problem by gently patting their back to burp them during and after your feedings.

Try burping every 2-3 oz. (59.14-88.72 mL) if you’re using formula, or each time you switch breasts if you’re nursing., Since your baby shares what you consume when you breastfeed, it’s a good idea to create a record of their likes and dislikes. Keep track of anything you add or eliminate and note how it affects your baby’s colic., Doctors may recommend that you cut dairy and allergy-causing products, caffeine, and cabbage or other green leafy veggies from your diet. Try skipping these foods and drinks for two weeks at a time and observing your baby’s responses.Allergy-causing foods to avoid are peanuts, eggs, tree nuts, whey, soy, and fish products. Leafy greens and cabbage-related vegetables on the restricted list may include broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts.
Check with your doctor before you make changes to your diet to ensure you’re still getting enough essential nutrients from what you eat.

, Hydrolysate formula contains already-broken-down milk proteins, which should help your baby’s digestion. If an allergy is causing your baby’s colic, you’ll notice improvement two days after changing formulas.Ask your doctor before you make this change, as they need to be updated on your baby’s diet.
You can also try a soy-based formula, but this may also cause allergies in your baby. Follow your doctor’s recommendations for which products you should try., If babies struggle to get milk through nipples with small openings, they may suck too much air into their bellies along with their food. Nipples with larger openings should allow your baby to suck gently and evenly., If your baby isn’t fully “latched” onto your breast, they may be pulling in too much air while they nurse. Get a proper latch by allowing the baby to pull your entire nipple into their open mouth once their tongue is down. None of your areola should be visible after the baby latches on.A good latch should result in a few minutes of “latch-on pain” followed by a deep pulling sensation in your breast. There should be few popping sounds.

, Popular remedies include gripe water, baby probiotics, and cell salts. The homeopathic industry is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, and there have been few medical studies showing the effectiveness of these cures. Your doctor can explain the risks and benefits of these items before you use them."

Swaddle your baby to help them feel secure.,
Give your baby a warm bath to calm and soothe them.,
Cuddle your baby to build their trust in you.,
Test different ways of holding your baby to see what they prefer.,
Massage your baby’s belly to help their digestion.",How to Treat Colic With Natural Remedies2," Being gently wrapped in a blanket may reproduce the feeling of being in the womb. This could help your baby avoid overstimulation, which may be the source of their colic., The warmth from a bath should ease any digestive discomfort your baby is experiencing. Try keeping them upright in the bath to help along their digestion.Don’t give your baby a full bath until after their umbilical cord falls off, usually about 2-3 weeks after birth. Until then, limit them to sponge baths.
Never fully submerge your baby in water.

, Your baby’s constant crying could be happening for any number of reasons. Let your baby know that you’re there for them by keeping them close to your body. They’ll respond positively to the feel of your body heat and heartbeat., One popular grip, known as the belly hold, involves the parent placing the baby face-down on their forearm and resting the baby’s head near the crook of the parent’s elbow, with the baby’s face looking out from the parent’s body. You can walk around slowly while patting your baby’s back during this hold.Be sure your baby’s head is turned outward so that they can breathe when they’re in face-down positions. You also want to be sure you’re carefully supporting their head and neck, especially before 4-6 months.

, Place your baby tummy-side-up on your lap. Imagine an upside-down U on your baby’s abdomen. Use baby-safe massage oil to very gently rub your baby’s belly in clockwise, circular motions along the line of the imaginary U. You can also try simply pressing your hand (with very low pressure!) into your baby’s tense belly as you lean them forward from your lap."
"
Walk around while you hold your baby upright.,
Take a walk in your neighborhood.,
Dance with your baby to make your time together more enjoyable.,
Use a chair to create motion for your baby.,
Drive your baby around in your car.",How to Treat Colic With Natural Remedies3," The combination of gentle motion from your walking and the baby’s upright position should help them digest and release painful gas. You can also try gently rocking or bouncing your baby as you walk., If the weather is dry and mild, try putting your baby in their stroller and going for a walk outside. The fresh air might soothe both you and your baby. This will also give them access to the motion they may be craving.

, If you’re getting bored with your typical walk-and-rock, try mixing up your motions. Move slowly and mimic the motions the baby felt in the womb, including up and down, side to side, and forward and backward. You can hum, sing, or even put on some light music as you dance., You may choose to sit in a rocking chair while holding your baby yourself. If you want a break, invest in a product that allows you to place your baby in a gently-swinging chair. Some of these chairs even include light massage options.

If you use a swinging baby chair, be sure your baby is fully and securely strapped in.

, Driving slowly with your baby in the car may provide them with the precise motion they need to calm down and relax. Be careful not to overuse this method, however, as it can quickly become a waste of gas.Avoid driving when you’re overtired. This will only put you and your baby in danger.

Play soft and calming music for your baby.,
Introduce white noise with a fan, dryer, or vacuum.,
Use your voice to give your baby both noise and vibration.,
Eliminate all stimuli by creating a silent environment.",How to Treat Colic With Natural Remedies4," Some babies may need background noise to avoid overstimulation. If you introduce a series of songs you play each time they get fussy, this will allow them to become familiar with the noises and the routine of listening to them. You can even sing along while you hold your baby against your chest so they can benefit from the noise and the vibration of your voice., Music may be too much for some babies, and you may get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again. Household products can provide you with alternatives, although you may need help to run the vacuum.Don’t put your baby on top of the dryer, even in their carrier. The vibration may cause the carrier to fall off the appliance.

, If you cuddle your baby close to the crook of your neck while speaking to them in low, soothing tones, your baby can both feel and hear your voice. This is especially effective for dads, whose deeper voices cause more vibrations., Your baby may be contrary and crave silence rather than noise. Give your baby a calming environment by keeping the room dark and quiet while you simply hold them. Your baby may need a break from motion as well."

Encourage more complicated language, even if incorrect.In the multiple-word sentence stage (2 - 2.5 years) she will start putting the rules of language together.,
Ask more complicated questions as her ability grows.,
Carry on full conversations.",How to Teach Your Baby to Talk," You can do this as you would normally, listening to music on a stereo or through the speakers of your car. Avoid putting headphones directly on your stomach, as this can overstimulate your unborn child.The recommended volume for your child to best enjoy music that you play should be at about the level of the ambient noise made by a washing machine.

Children begin to hear and make sense of sound in the womb at about 25 weeks into your pregnancy.Exposing your child to music in the womb does not guarantee that your child will be mathematically inclined or musically apt.But by engaging your child with sound, you give it practice at discerning differences in it.
Simple melodies will be less overwhelming for your child.Consider songs you might put your baby to sleep with, or childhood songs like:
The ABC songYou are my SunshineHush Little BabyTwinkle Twinkle Little Star

;
, Children can recognize the voices of parents and other family members that it has heard while in the womb.By talking to her or reading her books, you will help her begin learning about sound while still in the womb., Different languages follow different rules of stress and intonation. Studies have shown that your newborn will have the ability to identify her native tongue, so she might benefit from being familiarized with other languages.You might consider:


Watching foreign films.
Sitting in on classes teaching language.
Doing light volunteer work with an ethnically oriented outreach program.

, While it is unlikely that your child will learn the song you are singing in the way young children or adults do, familiarization with common childhood songs may encourage her learning of it after being born.There are many songs for you to choose from, including:


One Two, Buckle my Shoe
One Potato, Two Potato
Three Little Piggies
Months of the Year Song

, Your baby likely won't be able to articulate words until she is between the ages of 10 and 13 months.Instead, she will coo and cry as a means of communication. Respond to these as you would normally, and don't fret over using baby-talk. The cutesy language used to communicate with young children might actually help hold your child's attention and stimulate language learning.Try to match coos and cries with the objects she directs her sounds at. Instead of bringing her a bottle, ask, ""Does baby Tiffany want her bottle? Dada will bring you a bottle.""
Combine specific items with your spoken responses. You might ask her, ""Is this what you want? Does baby Gabby want her stuffed elephant?""

, This is especially important while she is learning to coordinate her speaking with new vocabulary. She might make a certain noise or cry when she is hungry or needs to be changed. Respond to this as you normally would with spoken language, saying things like:


""Little Emma feels like she needs her diaper changed! Do you need your diaper changed? Let's get you a fresh diaper!""
""Is baby Bethany hungry? It's almost lunch time. Let's go get your bottle ready.""
""Do you need more? More milk? Here you go.""

, When you interact with your baby or are doing something in front of her, describe the process as you do it. You might describe what you are shopping for in the supermarket, how you are buckling her into her car seat, or even what you are making for lunch.


""Does Kristin need help getting her toy off the shelf? I'll be right there, honey. Just let mama wash these dishes. Wash, wash, wash!""
""Look, Sarah! Fido wants to come in from going potty outside. Good boy, Fido.""
""What's daddy doing? Is he getting Amelia's favorite book? Look Amelia! I got it. Hooray! Let's sit down and read the book together.""

, If she's clapping her hands, say ""You're clapping so well, Amy!"" When she gets excited to see a family member coming towards her, say ""There's Dada, Meg! Are you so happy to see Dada?"" This is natural for many parents, but by saying, ""That's your toy! Are you playing with your toy?"" you will help your baby make connections between items and words, as well as her own actions and name.

, You may think that you are encouraging overly talkative behavior when you narrate daily life to your child, but this is not the case.Try not to worry about that, because your child will hear and understand a great deal, and she may even pick up on your hesitancy. After all, even young children can understand facial expressions.

Children who are not talked to enough during language development are often negatively impacted later in life.Some research suggests that children in talkative families are more linguistically stimulated due to the regular exchange of language. This could be a potential link to better performance on reading tests at older ages., Difficult phrases can trip even experienced speakers up, and these can be fun exercises for your child to practice. You might repeat difficult daily expressions that you've become tongue tied over, or you might try some simple tongue twisters like:


She Sells Sea Shells
Whether the Weather
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a Bear

, Children are sensitive to sound and can be easily upset by loud or confusing noises. The noise level of neonatal intensive care units is 50 decibels, or the sound of regular conversation at home., It has been proven that reading has a powerful positive influence on your child's development, including her language development.Reading will help develop her imagination and also contribute the expansion of her vocabulary. Familiar words will become reinforced in her mind, and enable her to start using those new words.


You don't have to wait until your child is old enough to make sense of the words on the page. A book with colorful pictures can become a pre-nap teaching activity.

, You only want what's best for your child, and when you think she should be at a certain level and she's not, it can be frustrating for a parent. However, your child will learn language at her own speed, and it's important to be patient and encouraging with her while she makes sense of vocabulary and grammar., In most cases, there is nothing to worry about, but sometimes lack of speech, motor control, or other features can indicate a developmental delay in your child.Early recognition of a delay can frequently result in the issue being resolved.To this end, you may want to bring it to your pediatrician's attention if you notice:


3 - 4 months: poor head support, no babbling or infrequent noise-making, regular eye crossing, and a lack of social smiling.4 - 7 months: overly stiff or floppy body, difficulty keeping head steady, difficulty sitting, lack of noise response/social smiling, lack of expressed affection toward caregivers, and doesn't interact with objects.7 - 12 months: no crawling, lack of evenness while crawling (one month after starting), can't stand with assistance, lacks curiosity (especially with hiding games like peek-a-boo), speaks infrequently, and doesn't use body language.13 - 24 months: unable to walk by 18 months, cannot make sense or use of daily objects, cannot vocalize a minimum of six words by 18 months or two-word responses by 24 months, doesn't repeat and mimic words and actions, cannot follow simple instructions, loses previously mastered skills.3 - 5 years: speech delays (stuttering, lisping, difficulty with articulation), poor motor skills, and under-developed social/emotional skills., In the pre-linguistic stage (0 - 13 months) your child will babble, cry, coo, and imitate some sounds with poor control. Toward the end of this phase, she might even begin saying, ""dadada"" or ""mamama.""Encourage these sounds and connect each with actions and objects throughout this phase.

, In the holophrastic stage (10 - 13 months), your baby will mostly speak one word at a time, adding meaning through context and non-verbal cues.For example, she might say, ""Dada"" forcefully, indicating she wants her father to come to her.

, The two-word sentence phase (at about 18 months) is where she will begin joining parts of speech together. She will often put nouns with adjectives or verbs with modifiers in expressions like, ""Bottle give,"" ""Where dada?"", and ""Not mama."", At this point, she'll probably make many linguistic errors, like ""I catched it"" or ""I falling off it."" This is normal, and part of the learning process.Encourage her efforts so she knows you are proud of her efforts at communication.

, When she reaches the complex sentence phase (2.5 - 3 years) she will have some practice at speaking. She'll start trying to put her thoughts in more complicated patterns.There are frequently many errors at this stage. Do not punish your child for poor grammar; this can make her afraid of speaking and making an error.Instead, ask her to explain herself and describe her thoughts.

, At the adult-like sentence stage (5 - 6 years), her grammar should be near native and her usage of even complex structures seamless.Continue to encourage reading and speaking around her, as this will still stimulate her linguistic centers and help her continue learning.

Remember to register for items at a wide variety of price points.,

Submit the registry form.,
Consider a more informal method.",How to Start a Baby Registry," Creating a baby registry can be a deceptively long process and may take a few revisions, so it is best to start early.


Most expectant moms start around twelve weeks, and add to their registry as they find out the gender of the baby. Aim to have your registry completed by the time you are six months pregnant.
Take into account when your baby shower is being held, and give guests a good opportunity to access your registry beforehand. The sooner you create a registry, the sooner people can being purchasing your desired items.;
, The first big step in creating a baby registry is choosing where to do it. Nearly every department store or baby store has a baby registry option.


Most moms register at one or two stores to give their baby shower guests options without making it too overwhelming.
If the thought of registering more than once makes your stomach churn, register for everything at a store that sells all of the baby basics.

, You should try to choose a store that is convenient for them. You’ll also want a store with a location near you for those inevitable returns or gift cards.


Choose a store with a large online selection, so out of town friends can still send gifts.

, Make sure it will be easy to return unwanted or duplicate items. Some stores also offer perks to their baby registers, such as completion discounts to get items left on your registry that weren’t given as gifts.

, If you enjoy bargains and aren’t picky about brand names, a registry at Target or Walmart is a good option. If you prefer fancier items, register at a place like Pottery Barn.

, A growing trend for baby registries is to use a universal registry that pulls from multiple stores.


This gives you the dream items from multiple stores in one place, so you can manage things easily and your friends and family can conveniently see everything at once.
Universal registries, such as MyRegistry.com or Wishpot.com, can be convenient for some people but may not offer the perks or ease of returning like with traditional registries.
You’ll also most likely have to complete your entire registry online, instead of choosing items in the physical store.

, This is especially helpful for the big-ticket items like cribs, car seats, and strollers.


Discuss with your partner how much money you want to spend and what characteristics of these items are important to you. Read reviews and talk to other moms about products they liked and didn’t like.
Preparatory research will help calm your nerves during the actual registering and help you find items that will be a good fit for you and your baby.

, Once you have chosen your registry location, visit the store to meet with a registry consultant, typically in the guest services center.


Some stores have a kiosk to enter your personal information, and other stores have a person to talk to and take your information.
You’ll then be given a “zapper gun” to walk around the store and scan the barcodes of items you would like. Once an item is scanned, you can change the quantity and edit items. Most stores also let you edit and add to your registry on their website.

, Be aware of your friends and family’s budget constraints and choose a selection of smaller, less expensive items.


You also shouldn’t shy away from larger, more expensive items in case friends give a group gift or someone is feeling particularly generous.
However, the bulk of your gifts should be in the mid-price range, somewhere between $30 to $700.

, Your best bet is to stick with the basics and resist the urge to register for everything in the store. The more items you have on your registry, the less likely you are to get the things you actually need. Many stores offer baby registry checklists of things that should be included on your registry—these can be a good guideline, but don’t feel like you have to register for every single thing on the list. A sample list is as follows:


Onesies (4-8)
Pajamas (4-8)
Socks (5-10)
Hats (1-3)
Crib or Bassinet, Mattress, Sheets
Portable play yard
Blankets (4-6)
Car seat
Stroller
Changing table or changing pad
Diapers, wipes, diaper rash cream
Diaper pail and liners
Baby bathtub
Hooded towels and washcloths (2-3)
Soap, lotion
Burp cloths (6-12)
Bottles, formula, breast pump
High chair
Bowls, spoons, bibs, sippy cups
Baby swing or bouncer seat
Baby monitor
Safety gate and childproofing products
Nail clippers, thermometer

, Although the focus of a baby registry and a baby shower is to get you ready for a newborn baby, that doesn’t mean you can’t add essentials your baby will need as he grows, such as supplies for eating solids, or clothes in larger sizes.

, After you have registered for the essentials, you can add a few fun items like clothes, toys, or books. Keep in mind that many people will give you clothes and other items without using your registry. Only include toys and other extra items if you are set on that exact item.

, The completed registry form is submitted to the store or entered online so that the information can be added to the store's database. Friends and family will be able to access the registry at the store or online to choose a baby item to purchase.


The registry will automatically keep track of items that were purchased and mark them as such so that the parents do not get unnecessary duplicates.
The parents can also access their list at any time to add or remove items and make any other changes, such as adding the baby’s gender when it is known.

, If, for some reason, the parents choose not to go with a store registry, they can still get a list of baby items from various parenting and store websites. The only problem with doing this is that there is no automatic tracking for what has already been purchased.


In order to keep the gifts more of a surprise until the baby shower, the parents can ask a friend or family member to manage the list and be the main contact person for people that are shopping for the baby gifts.

, Kid specific clothing stores such as The Children’s Place and Gap Kids heavily discount items every time a new clothing line moves in.  This usually happens once or twice a season.  Ask them about signing up for email alerts, coupon mailers, and store point cards to get even bigger discounts.  The Children’s Place, for example, offers Monster sales several times a year where you can find clothing and shoes up to 60% off.

Start early.,
Make stories a part of your daily bedtime routine.,
Try classic books for babies.,
Read to babies in a gentle, relaxing voice.",How to Read a Bedtime Story1," It might seem silly to read to your baby before they understand language or can focus on the pictures in a book. But reading to your baby at a young age will associate the warmth and comfort of your presence with the experience of reading, which might help to ensure that they grow into a book lover.


Even in the womb, a baby can hear your voice and begin to associate it with you. As a newborn, your baby will love hearing the sound of your voice and will also learn the cadence of language.;
, Having a routine at bedtime can help your baby settle into sleep easier and ensure that they sleep longer. It's also a great time to sit and cuddle together, and help your baby wind down from the day.


Consider a nightly bath, pajamas, a story, and then bed. Try to do the same routine each night at about the same time., Your baby can't understand words or follow a complicated story, so choose a book that is beautiful or engaging to look at and interesting to hear. The sounds of the words themselves can be educational to your child, who is just learning about language. Choose a book with a gentle, rhyming cadence. Also look for a book that is brief, since a baby won't have a long attention span when they're tired in the evening.


Some great English-language bedtime stories for babies include Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown, Bear Snores On by Karma Wilson, and Time for Bed by Mem Fox., Try to vary your pitch a bit as you read to keep your baby's attention and help them understand the flow of language. Because it is bedtime, avoid reading stories that are too active or upbeat. These might overstimulate a sleepy baby and make it harder for them to fall asleep.

"
"
Let your child choose the book.,
Expect to read the same story over and over.,
Choose something you enjoy, too.,
Consider a popular book for this age group.",How to Read a Bedtime Story2," There are several ways you might do this, depending on your child's personality and how well they are able to choose from a selection of books.


Take your child to the library and let them choose several picture books to bring home. For a child who is new to books, choose just two or three books; children who love story time and want a different book each night should get five to ten. When it is time for a bedtime story, let your child choose from the library books. You can also let your child choose from books in your home library, if you have one.
Alternately, if your child needs a bit of help with choosing, narrow it down to two or three books and then let your child choose.

, Children at this age learn from repetition, and you may literally have to read the same bedtime story dozens of times before your child tires of it. Your child is busy memorizing the pictures and words, and gets a thrill from knowing what is coming on the next page.


Kids learn from repetition. Reading the same book over and over can help to increase your child's vocabulary.Reading a familiar book is also a great way for a child to wind down at the end of the day. Their favorite books are comforting and soothing and can help ease them into a sleepy state., It can be a lot of fun to read books to children, but it can also be stressful or boring if you choose the wrong type of book. Some people love reading the tongue-twisting rhymes of Dr. Seuss books, for example, while other people find that type of reading difficult and unpleasant. If you enjoy a particular type of children's book or a particular author, be sure to incorporate those books into your reading ritual.


If your child is old enough and has a good attention span, you might try reading two short picture books every night. Let your child choose one, and you choose the other.

, Most toddlers and preschoolers love picture books that feature interesting but simple stories, lovable characters, and rhythm or rhyme in the words. Try to choose a book that is not too long, or your child (or you) might become bored.


Most children's picture books are around thirty pages; for this age group, look for books that do not have dense paragraphs of text but rather just a few lines on every page.
Some good titles for two to five year old children include What! Cried Granny by Kate Lum, The Napping House by Audrey Wood, and The Going to Bed Book by Sandra Boynton."
"
Try reading chapter books together.,
Don't worry about who chooses the book.,
Don't forget their old favorites.,
Read together as long as they are interested.",How to Read a Bedtime Story3," Before your child learns to read, you can read the book to your child. As your child gets older, you may find it fun to alternate paragraphs, or have your child read the book to you. Aim for one chapter per night.


Many elementary schools require their students to read for a set amount of time each night. Incorporating this homework into your bedtime story is a great way to multitask and make the homework fun.

, Sometimes your child may want to choose, and that's great. If your child doesn't have a strong opinion about what to read, you can introduce them to your own childhood favorites, or consult a list of popular children's books to find a new favorite for you both to enjoy.


Some classic stories for elementary-aged children include the Boxcar Children series by Gertrude Chandler Warner, The BFG by Roald Dahl, and The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster.
Older children ages twelve and up might enjoy books like the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling or even the Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien.

, Even when your child is old enough for longer chapter books, they might still enjoy a fun picture book every now and then. Follow your child's lead.


Remember that it is more important for you to spend this time together reading something they enjoy than it is to worry about the level or type of book that you're reading.

, You don't have to set a time limit on bedtime stories. It is totally normal for big kids to enjoy bedtime stories. If you have several kids, the oldest may still enjoy participating in bedtime stories together with the younger children.


At some point, your child may decide they would rather read on their own. That's ok too! You’ve had many wonderful years of bedtime stories.

"
"
Choose a cozy place to read.,
Focus on the child's interests.,
Read with expression.,
Encourage your child with early literacy strategies.,
Ask your child questions.,
Show enthusiasm for reading.,
Keep the book's complexity one level ahead of your child's comprehension.",How to Read a Bedtime Story4," You might like to sit in a rocking chair or a cozy love seat for your bedtimes stories. You can also cuddle in your bed or your child's to help induce sleepiness.


Let young children sit on your lap, and cuddle with a blanket while you read. Older children can snuggle next to you with your arm around their shoulders. If your child doesn't prefer to cuddle, that's ok too. Being together is what matters.

, While there are certain stories that are traditionally read at bedtime (like Goodnight Moon), you can read almost any type of story as a bedtime story. Most children express interest in certain types of books, and their interest can change over time. It's perfectly ok to choose a ""bedtime story"" that is not a typical story.


For instance, many children love to look at seek-and-find picture books, or may find looking at an almanac of dog breeds interesting. The important thing is to spend the time with your child and a book in a low-pressure, reassuring environment.

, Children of all ages love to listen to expressive tones of voice during story time. When you read a bedtime story with expression, your child will pick up on your enthusiasm and listen intently to the story. Try giving every character a distinct voice, and don't be afraid to be silly.
Build anticipation for what will come next in the story by adding strategic pauses or exclamations to the words on the page. For instance, instead of saying, ""Outside the window, she saw a big brown bear,"" you might say, ""Outside the window she saw a big… brown…. BEAR!""

, Even if your child can't yet read, there are a few things you can do to help them acquire the skills needed to begin reading. Try:


Pointing at words as you say them. This helps to teach the child that words on the page correlate to spoken words.
Anticipating what will happen next. Ask your child to predict what will happen on the next page. This encourages them to use context clues and decipher the story arc.
Read a few words, then ask an early reader to read a word. You can point to sight words they've learned recently, or ask them to sound out a word they don't yet know.

, You don't have to just read a story straight through; you can stop at any point to discuss what you've read, ask your child questions, or let your child look at the pictures in detail. A bedtime story should be enjoyable and relaxed.

, At the end of a long day, it can be hard to muster excitement for another round of Goodnight Moon when all you want to do is put your children to bed and enjoy some quiet time to yourself. But your children will pick up on your enthusiasm or lack thereof.


Remember that this time with your children is something they look forward to all day. Try to be present in the moment and enjoy it.

, Children learn a lot during bedtime stories. You can help grow their vocabularies by reading a book that is just a bit difficult, so that they are exposed to new words and slightly longer sentences. If your child is four years old, try books geared for five or six year old children. Generally, the age recommendations for picture books can be found on the back of the book's title page.


If you come across a word that your child does not know, briefly define it as you read. For instance, as you are reading, you might say: ""The princess memorized the secret code. Memorized means she learned it so that she could remember it later.""
Don't read a book that is too difficult. If you see your child losing interest, you might want to choose a different book.

"
Read at a slow pace.,
Don’t focus on reading the exact words.,
Use your voice and hands.,
Allow the baby to touch the book.,
Point to pictures.,
Ask questions.",How to Read a Book to a Baby or Infant1," As you read, make sure to go slow. In addition, enunciate words carefully and correctly. This way, your child – depending on age – can better follow along. In addition, reading slowly will make your time together more relaxed and enjoyable for both of you. Ultimately, if you rush through the book, the experience may seem stressful to you and your child., As you read, don’t stress about reading the book word-for-word. It is more important that you convey important ideas and engage your child in the book. Ultimately, focusing on reading the book word-for-word will not only distract you from this goal, it will also make the reading experience less attractive for your child.Paraphrase, if you want.
Rephrase or put difficult sentences or concepts in your own words.
Express familiar concepts in a language or cultural perspective that is unique to your family.

, Whether you’re reading to an infant or an older baby, try to be as interactive as you can. This includes changing the intonation of your voice, pitch, and more. In addition, use your hands to express the story to make it more exciting. After doing this, you’ll find that your child will be much more engaged in the activity., While infants may grab at the book and occasionally touch it, older babies will likely show more of an interest in touching the book. Touching the book is important as it will allow your child to gain an attachment to the book and be more vested in the reading process.


Help infants touch pictures and different textures and surfaces in the book.
Encourage older babies to help you turn the page., As you read your book, make sure to point to the pictures that are the subject of what you’re reading about. For example, if you’re reading about an apple on a given page, point to the picture. Then, encourage your child to point to and touch the picture, too. By pointing out what you’re talking about, you’ll stimulate your child and begin to lay the foundation of their vocabulary., While you read, stop and ask your child questions. Questions will make the experience more entertaining, interactive, and might pique your child’s interest. In fact, it doesn’t matter if your child understands the question you’re asking or even answers. Questions are more about transforming the reading experience into a dialogue between you and your child.

If the subject of your book is about pets, ask your child whether they like dogs or cats better.
If the subject of your book is about colors, ask what color they prefer. Then, use the opportunity to point out colors throughout the room."

Read daily.,
Pick a time when your child is calm and alert.,
Choose a good location.,
Place your baby on your lap.,
Find an appropriate book.,
Stop reading if the baby is unhappy.",How to Read a Book to a Baby or Infant2," Although it might sometimes be difficult to find the time to read, you should make it a point to read to your child every day. Ultimately, all you need is you, your child, a book, and a few minutes.Don’t stress about finishing an entire book.
If you’re short on time, five minutes may just do the trick. If you have more time, try to read for fifteen to thirty minutes.

, Make sure your child has been fed, has a fresh diaper, and has napped. If your child is alert and in a good mood, they'll get a lot more out of the experience.


While you may want to make reading part of your bedtime/naptime routine, you should also schedule reading time when your child is alert., When it’s time to read, find a good and relaxing location – like the baby’s nursery. The location should be relatively quiet, have sufficient light to read, and should have a comfortable space for you and your baby to sit. Avoid places where you or your baby will be distracted.Let other family members know that it is reading time.
Secure pets in another room so they don’t distract you or the baby from reading time.
Put your cell phone on mute.

, Situate your baby so they’re sitting or lying in your lap or against your body. This way, you’ll be able to hold the book in front of them at their eye level. This is important, so the baby will be able to sense your closeness and see the book as you read it., An important part of reading is making sure you have an age appropriate book. Ultimately, not all books work best for all ages. As a result, consider the stage of your child is in and then pick a book that works for your child.


Choose a book with little to no text and big, contrasting pictures for children 0 to 6 months old. Good books for this age group include ‘’Twinkle, Twinkle,’’ ‘’The Baby’s Lap Book,’’ and ‘’The Three Bears Rhyme Book.’’
For children 7 to 12 months, you can choose books that have vocabulary they might use every day. For example, books that reinforce words like “mommy,” “daddy,” “milk,” or “reading.”
Pick books that have a sentence or two on each page for children age 13 to 18 months., Once your baby has demonstrated that they’re done reading, you should quit. If you force reading, you’ll build a negative association and turn your child off to it in the future. Ultimately, if your child seems to be hungry, has messed their diaper, is crying, or is otherwise distracted, stop reading."

Choose a padded play area.,
Remain close to the ground.,
Avoid sharp edges.,
Supervise the baby.",How to Safely Rough and Tumble Play with Your Baby1," When you are playing with the baby, find a soft, cushioned, or padded area. If the baby accidentally slips or falls, they will land on the padded play area. A couch, bed, or carpeted floor may be suitable. You can also roll out a tumble mat or lay down some pillows to provide extra protection., If the baby falls a long distance, they may become injured. It is better to remain close to the ground or a padded surface when playing with the baby. Sitting on a couch, carpeted floor, or bed can help reduce the chances of a bad fall.

, While rough and tumble playing, you do not want to accidentally hit your baby’s head on a table corner or other sharp edge. When playing, make sure you are in a clear area that is free of clutter. Remove any objects that your baby could accidentally hit, fall upon, or trip over., If you are not holding the baby during play, you should watch them at all times. If they are crawling, make sure that they do not fall off a couch or bed during play. Prevent them from crawling into another room by closing the door. A playpen or baby gates can safely confine the baby while they crawl and play."

Bounce the baby on your knees.,
Lift the baby above your head.,
Tickle the baby.,
Swing the baby.,
Chase the baby.,
Avoid shaking the baby during play.",How to Safely Rough and Tumble Play with Your Baby2," Sit on a secure seat. Place the baby on your knees. Hold them under their arms, and gently rock your legs up and down to bounce the baby. Do not let go of the baby. Avoid vigorously shaking the baby., Instead of tossing the baby in the air, you should try lifting them above your head instead. Hold them under both arms with two hands, and raise them above your head, so that they are looking down at you. Glide them through the air. Do not release the baby, and keep both hands on the baby at all times.Tossing the baby increases the risk that the baby will be dropped, and a fall from that height could injure the baby. Furthermore, the sensation of being tossed might cause shaking-related injuries., You can start tickling the baby at around two months of age. Tickle the baby softly around their ribs, or gently stroke their foot. Only tickle the baby for a minute or two. Stop if the baby starts squirming, crying, or trying to roll away., When swinging a baby, hold the baby under their arms, not by their hands. Lift them an inch or two above a surface, and rock them gently from side to side. Do not swing roughly. You can also rest one hand under the baby’s neck and the other beneath their bum. Making a wide sweeping movement, rock the baby slowly.When swinging the baby, make sure that the area is clear. Keep a safe distance from furniture, walls, and other people to avoid accidentally swinging the baby into something.
If you hold the baby’s hands or elbows while swinging, you run the risk of injuring their joints or arms. It is always best to handle a baby under the arms instead.

, If the baby is crawling or walking, you can start chasing them.In a contained area, move towards the baby. You make play noises, such as monstrous roaring or say something playful such as “I’m going to get you.” If the baby, laughs and moves away, walk or crawl towards them. When you catch them, grab them with both hands and swing them into the air.


If the baby starts to crawl or hide, they may not enjoy this type of play. They might be scared. Stop immediately.
Watch that the baby does not crawl off the edge of a surface, run into a wall, or hit their face on a sharp corner. If it seems as though the play is getting too rough, stop chasing. Start playing a different game instead.
If the baby trips or falls, wait for a reaction. If they are uninjured, they may giggle and continue to play.

, Shaking a baby can cause severe brain damage. While moving the baby, instead of vigorously shaking or jostling the baby, use slow and controlled movements with wide movements.Symptoms of Shaken Baby Syndrome include vomiting, weakness, and irritability.Too much shaking can also increase the risk that you will accidentally strike the baby's head on an object.

Secure the baby’s head and neck.,
Protect the baby’s elbows and joints.,
Watch for signs of happy play.,
Stop if the baby cries.,
Avoid roughhousing before bed.",How to Safely Rough and Tumble Play with Your Baby3," Babies can start playing very young, but you may want to wait until the baby is a little older to start some activities. While newborns may enjoy being held and bounced, you may want to wait until the baby is three or four months old before you start swinging them around or lifting them high in the air., Babies have weak neck muscles, and they may not be able to protect their heads during play. While playing, make sure that the head and neck are supported. Place a hand beneath the baby’s neck. The baby’s head should not be snapping back and forth, nor should the baby experience any whiplash. If you notice this happening, stop immediately. Try slower movements in the future with wider arcs of movement., Your baby may not have developed strong joints or muscles yet, and vigorous play may cause accidental injury. When handling your baby, hold them under the arms instead of by the hands or elbows. Do not hold them by the feet or upside down., If the baby is enjoying themselves, they will likely be smiling or giggling. Their muscles will be relaxed. They will interact with you, by touching your face or mimicking your movements., If the baby starts crying, it means that they are not enjoying the rough play. While rough play can be beneficial to babies, it is not advisable to continue if the baby is uncomfortable. Other signs of discomfort include clenching face muscles or excessive squirming., It is best not to rile up the baby too much before they go to bed. Too much excitement may interfere with their sleeping patterns. It is better to rough play earlier in the day when they do not have to sleep. Allow them to wind down before taking a nap or going to bed."

Mount the gate in the desired location.,
Check the gate regularly.",How to Put Up a Baby Gate1," Pressure fit gates can be installed easily without any special tools, but they do require rigid, sturdy, flat surfaces on both sides for secure attachment. They are a great choice for doorways and door frames. You’ll need the correct dimensions to make sure your gate will fit properly, though, so first measure the area where you want to install it.;
, Pressure fit gates come in various sizes and styles. Choose one that fits your measurements and suits your home’s style.


For maximum safety, check to make sure that the baby gate you purchase is certified by your local children’s product safety organization. In the United States, for example, check for certification from the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (the JPMA).

, Before you install the gate, read the manual and make sure you follow the manufacturer’s specific directions. The details of the installation procedure may vary slightly from one brand to another.

, Attach the gate to a sturdy, flat wall or frame on both sides.


Most gates have soft pads designed to protect your walls or door frames. This will keep the gate from scratching paints and finishes.

Locate a nutritionist or a registered dietitian who is knowledgeable in vegetarian diets.",How to Raise a Vegetarian Baby: First Foods1," If he does not, you may want to look elsewhere for the knowledge and support that you may need to guide you.;
, It may not be wise to start your baby on a vegetarian diet if there are other health concerns present. Get a clean bill of health for your baby before moving forward.


It is a good idea to have her checked for nutritional deficiencies. A simple blood test will be able to determine if she is lacking in any nutrients such as iron.
If deficiencies are detected, speak with your pediatrician about treatment options. Depending on the specific deficiency, it may be possible to continue with your plans for a vegetarian diet.

,


Babies can be very picky, especially when first starting out on solid foods. While bananas are an excellent source of potassium, your baby may simply refuse to eat them. This is where working with a nutritionist can be helpful, as she can recommend other foods that have a high potassium content.

Introduce only one food at a time.,
Offer rice or oat single grain cereal before offering fruit and vegetable varieties.,
Introduce vegetables and fruits one at a time.",How to Raise a Vegetarian Baby: First Foods2," Continue with the same one food for 3 to 5 days to allow time for any allergic reactions to surface. If you observe any signs of a possible allergic reaction, discontinue that food and consult your pediatrician.


Symptoms of a food allergy in babies include a red rash on the body, red or swollen lips or cheeks, swelling of the tongue, itching, coughing and difficulty breathing. If you notice that your baby is making strange sounds or if she appears to be choking, seek immediate medical treatment.

, Choose cereals that are fortified with iron. If your baby is formula fed, use an iron-fortified formula to prepare the cereal. These 2 steps will ensure that your baby is getting all of the iron that she needs, an essential mineral that is sometimes lacking in vegetarian diets.

, Start with vegetables first and then move onto fruits.


Stick with one type of vegetable or fruit for 3 to 5 days before moving onto another variety. This will give you enough time to determine if your baby has an allergy to a particular food. By isolating one food for a few days, you will be able to pinpoint the exact culprit if allergic symptoms do develop.
Cook all vegetables thoroughly and be sure to mash it well to prevent choking. To make a thinner consistency, use a food processor to puree the food. Green beans, carrots, peas and potatoes are all good first vegetarian foods.
Be sure to mash fruits well before giving them to your baby. Good choices for first fruits for vegetarian babies include mashed bananas, strained peaches, applesauce and mashed avocados.

Make sure your baby is comfortable.,
Get your baby’s attention.,
Hide your face.,
Reveal your face.,
Play peekaboo with a toy.,
Repeat the game.",How to Play Peekaboo1," You’ll never get your baby to sit still for a game of peekaboo if it’s hungry, tired or wet. Feed your baby before you play and make sure it takes a nap. Change its diaper if you need to.


Peekaboo can be overwhelming for a baby that is already agitated. You’re baby is likely to get upset during peekaboo if all its needs are not met prior.;
, For your baby to get the maximum benefit from a game of peekaboo, you’ll need it to make eye contact with you. You can get your baby’s attention by making a few strange sounds with your mouth or making funny faces. Try sticking out your tongue or making a distracting sound. Everything’s new to a baby, so if it hears you make a sound that it’s not used to or sees you make a face it hasn't seen before, it will be transfixed by you.


Make sure not to make sounds that are too loud or faces that are too scary. You don’t want to scare your baby.
Making eye contact with your baby helps it to develop social skills and prepares it to connect with people in the world.

, Cover your face with your hands or drape a towel or cloth over your face. Remember that to the baby, you’re not just hiding, you’re gone. At this stage of development, babies haven’t developed an understanding of object permanence. Object permanence means that an object (you) is still there even when the baby can’t see it. For this reason, the first few games of peekaboo can be a bit shocking to the baby.You can ease your baby’s mind by talking to it while you’re hiding. You can say something like “Where’d mommy go? Where is she?”
You can also hide yourself behind a piece of paper, a book or anything else that you have around.

, Uncover your face and let out an excited “peekaboo!” Try showing your baby a variety of faces to see what it likes. For example, your baby might like a big smile or sticking your tongue out while scary faces or yelling ""peekaboo"" loudly might scare it.


Make sure not to hide behind your hands for too long or your baby might become distressed, wondering whether or not you’re going to return.
Watch for signs that your baby may be overwhelmed. Peekaboo can be mind-blowing for a baby. If it turns its head to side or makes a face like it’s about to cry, you may want to wait a while before playing again.

, If your baby is between 4 and 6 months old, it's starting to develop object permanence. This means you can try hiding one of their favorite toys and letting them find it. When the baby finds the toy, remember to say something like ""You found it!""For example, take one of the baby's stacking rings and hide it under a blanket. Let the baby try to pull the blanket up or away to reveal the ring. Reward the baby with lots of verbal praise when it does this.

, Babies learn through repetition. Play peekaboo as much as you can. At first, your baby will be completely surprised that you reappear after you hide in your hands. After a while, your baby will start to suspect that you will reappear. They’ll be delighted when you prove them right.


The baby learns to deduce that because you always reappear when you hide your face, you’ll probably do the same thing this time.
While the baby doesn’t yet understand that you’re there the whole time, it forms a hypothesis that you will reappear. The baby is introduced to analytical thinking.

Make your pictures with happy faces, sad faces,grumpy faces and and any other expression you can think of.At this point in your baby’s development, it’s starting to differentiate between identities. The baby is gaining a sense of identity and learning to compare its own identity to others.
Seeing faces with different emotions will introduce your baby to social cues so he’ll be able to better understand how people feel.

, Make sure the pieces of cloth are long enough to completely cover the faces that you have drawn. Glue the pieces of cloth above the faces on the cardboard. There should be a flap of cloth that can be lifted to reveal the face.


Give the glue a little bit of time to dry before showing it to your baby.

, Choose one of your cards and show it to your baby. Have your baby lift the flap to reveal the face. When it does, say, “peekaboo!” Your baby will be excited to see what new faces are on different cards.


Your baby is beginning to understand the concept of object permanence. Creating an interactive game of peekaboo encourages the baby to explore its surroundings for hidden surprises.The baby is learning to do research to find answers. It deduces that to see the funny picture, it will have to do the work of lifting the flap.
You may have to show the baby how to lift the flap a few times before it understands what to do.

, Your baby will likely want to play the game over and over again. Your baby will be excited to lift the flap and discover the face underneath every time. Searching for the picture and finding it will give your baby a sense of accomplishment. They’ll feel like they solved the riddle and were rewarded with the picture.Pop-up books are popular with children for the same reason peekaboo is.
You can make new cards periodically to keep the game fresh.

, As your baby gets older, it will become more interactive with peekaboo. Try covering your baby's face with a light cloth or towel and say, ""Where's baby?"" Pull the blanket away and say, ""Boo!"" Keep doing this until your baby begins to tug away the blanket in anticipation.At first, your baby may just wiggle or squirm under the cloth. Eventually, it will begin pulling away the blanket and may even say, ""Boo!""

Hide.,
Have the toddler search for you.,
Say “You found me!” When the toddler finds you, reward them by excitedly telling them they found you.,
Encourage your toddler to play hide and seek with other toddlers.",How to Play Peekaboo3," Have your toddler close his eyes and count to ten while you find a place in the room to hide. If your toddler can’t count all the way to ten, you can just yell that you’re ready when it’s time for them to look for you.


Make sure to hide close by. Toddlers are at the stage in their development where they want to explore and socialize but they can experience separation anxiety if you’re too far away. They need you to be their “home base”., Your toddler is learning to explore their surroundings on foot. The freedom of being able to walk around is new to your toddler. Playing a simple game of peekaboo may not excite them as much as being able to personally search for you.


Your games of peekaboo should become more interactive as the child grows. The child should be able to experiment with the new skills they learn as they mature. Hide and seek is an evolution of peekaboo that allows the child to use their new-found mobility.

, Congratulating your toddler for finding you serves as positive reinforcement for them. It teaches them to get excited about searching out answers.As they grow, they’ll look forward to solving more complex puzzles.
You want your toddlers to take pride in finding you so that they’ll take pride in meeting other challenges later on in life.

, You toddler is at a place in their development where they’re starting to seek out social interaction. Teach them to play with other kids at an early age so that they grow up well adjusted socially.


Set up play dates with other families with toddlers.
Make sure to stay close by to keep an eye on the toddlers.

Without a feeling of safety, your baby will be unable to learn as well as they could. Immediately after birth there are a number of steps you can take to make your baby feel secure, all of which are related to bonding with your child.Skin-to-skin contact helps bonding and brings a feeling of safety.
Keep your baby close when going out. Try using a baby wrap rather than a stroller.
Breastfeed if possible, as this has a number of benefits for bonding and brain development.
Try to avoid fighting with your spouse in front of your baby, as this will make the baby feel insecure.;
, Many parents worry that responding immediately to a baby's needs will result in spoiling a child, but this is not true. By responding immediately to your baby you are teaching him that they can communicate with you. You are also providing your baby with the security they need to develop into a smart baby., Children who are socialized with other children from a young age learn important life skills. It helps children become familiar with different ideas, people and cultures. Early socialization will also help your child when they go to school. They will be better prepared for a social environment, and recent studies suggest your child may read better as a result of socialization as well., We live in a high-tech and fast paced world, where there are apps and television programs designed to make your baby smarter from birth. Recent studies suggest that this is not the case, and claim that such programs may actually slow word learning. Some scientists argue that these results were found because apps and television replace one-on-one time between parents and their baby.As you go about your day, talk to your baby and tell her what you are doing and why. Even though she cannot respond, she are listening to everything you say!
By the age of three, babies who are talked to frequently have an IQ 1.5 times as high as those who were not talked to frequently., Excessive use of such devices has been shown to impact upon children in negative ways, ranging from poorer performance in school to attention deficit problems. Given that your child's brain is developing so rapidly at an early age, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend the use of these devices for children under two.Try setting up a 'screen-free' zones in your house. Make sure there are no televisions, video games or tablets in bedrooms. Also, try turning off the television during dinner.Educational television and apps are not necessarily a bad thing, but they should not be used to replace one-on-one parent contact and not be used before the age of two.

, While your baby will not be able to read, introducing her to reading early on will help her become a life long readers, and people who read tend to be smarter. Reading is also a great way to connect and bond with your baby.Buy books or barrow books from the library with lots of pictures. Your baby will love them and the sound of your voice.

, Toys have been show to help with a baby's brain development. It is important that toys are age appropriate - do not let your infant play with toys for a 2 year old, for instance. Toy labels are clearly marked with age guidelines and they should be followed.Infants up to 9 months are fascinated by colors and sound, so try giving a rattle to babies this age.
After 9 months your baby should be able to play with puzzle toys, so try giving her a stacking toy.
Any toys that encourage curiosity will be beneficial for your baby's intelligence.

, Experiencing different environments helps with a baby's brain development. It broadens a baby's horizons and allows him to see new and interesting things. Likewise, exploring different materials and textures will help get him interested in new things. All of this helps develop a smart baby.To experience different things, take your baby to different places: the grocery store, the library, museums, aquariums, zoos, farmer's markets and any other place where you may run errands.
Help your child explore different materials, textures and temperatures. Let him or her discover things for themselves, but be sure to provide a safe environment.

, When you are walking outside play games like ""what color is that car"" or ""what shape is that sign"". While playing these games, be sure to encourage your child constantly as they begin talking and identifying things. This will give her the confidence they need to be smart and expressive!


As you explore, point objects out with your finger to help your baby learn faster.

, Numerous scientific studies have concluding that breast feeding is the best food for your baby's brain development. Furthermore, studies have suggested that babies who are breastfeed exclusively have more brain development than babies who are given a combination of breast milk and formula.Doctors suggest breastfeeding for at least three months.

, Once you baby has stopped breastfeeding or formula, there are a number of foods that can be introduced that benefit brain growth. These include: blueberries, yogurt, squash, lentils, broccoli, avocado, meats, prunes, mandarin oranges and dark leafy green vegetables like spinach.Try cooking a stew with meat to make it nice and soft for your baby.
Try steaming spinach and mixing it in with your baby's cereal.
Don't be concerned with unsaturated fat. Your baby actually needs it for brain development.

, Studies have shown that children with regular physical activity score better on cognitive tests than children who are inactive. In particular, physical children are better at paying attention.A German study of older children found that children learn vocabulary words 20% faster after exercise.


Try getting your infant out of the car seat and stroller more. Of course your baby needs to remain in a car seat while driving, but keeping her in a car seat for hours at a time while not driving may actually be slowing her physical and mental development.Toddlers should get at least 30 minutes of structured play time per day.
Preschoolers should get at least 60 minutes.

Have eating concerns evaluated.",How to Measure Baby Growth," If your baby is steadily gaining weight, it is a good sign that she is healthy and feeding well.Weighing your baby can be especially helpful if she is a newborn that lost weight after birth or if there are other health concerns.


Use a baby scale to weigh your baby if you have one. This will give the most accurate reading because they can read smaller increments of weight; however, you can also a precise reading if you have a working and accurate scale. Simply weigh yourself while holding the baby and then weigh yourself after you’ve set your baby down in a safe space. Subtract your weight from the combined weight. The difference is about how much your baby weighs.Be aware that a baby’s weight can fluctuate throughout the day just like an adult. In order to get the most accurate measurements, try weighing your baby under the same conditions each time. For example, you could weigh the baby at the same time every day, right before a feeding, or after changing her diaper.;
, It can be difficult to measure a baby’s length accurately, especially if he moves a lot.Despite the difficulty, you may still want to have an idea of how your baby compares to growth charts or even buy the proper sized clothing for your baby.


Ask your partner or a family member to help you. He can help gently stretch out your baby’s leg to get the most accurate measurement.Lay your baby down on your bed, changing table or another soft, flat surface. Use a soft, flexible measuring tape to measure the baby from the top of the head to the heel. If your baby is too busy squirming, lay him down on top of a sheet of paper on a flat surface. Mark the sheet under the baby with a pencil at the top of the head and again at the bottom of the heel. Remove the baby and measure the length between the two marks.
Remember that this number likely won’t be exactly the same as your doctor’s, but it is still a good ballpark figure.

, A baby’s head growth can signal certain medical conditions or developmental problems. Checking the circumference, or the distance, around your baby’s head can indicate normal growth or alert you to see a doctor about possible issues.Wrap a soft and flexible measuring tape around your baby’s head just above her eyebrows and ears and then around the back of the head where her head slopes up prominently from the neck. You want to measure the baby’s head at the place where its circumference is largest.Make sure to line up the starting line on the measuring tape with the final point of the measurement. You can put a small dot or mark at each end to help you more accurately get the measurement, especially if your baby is squirming.

, In addition to your baby’s vital statistics, you can also check other factors, such as feeding, to measure his growth. Combined with weight, length, and head circumference, these can give you a sense of how your baby is growing. Look at:How often your baby feeds
How quickly your baby grows out of his clothing
When your baby meets developmental milestones such as smiling and waving
Whether your baby seems happy, alert, and generally well

, It’s important to be aware that your home measurements may not be as accurate as your pediatrician’s. Your doctor has specialized instruments to get the most accurate information about your baby’s development; however, you may also pick up on mistakes that your doctor made. As long as there isn’t a significant discrepancy in measurements, you can rest assured about your efforts.Take your own measurements after a doctor’s visit so that you can compare your scale to your doctor’s. This can give you a good reference point when you take measurements at other times.
Check your work by doing each measurement twice. If the two numbers don’t match, do a third round and take the more consistent number.

, It’s a good idea to take notes in a notebook any time you measure your baby. You can use these not only to chart and examine her growth, but also see how the measurements compare with those of your pediatrician.


Make sure to have the notebook and pencil ready before you start measuring your baby. This can keep you from scrambling around with a fussy or squirmy baby. Write the date at the top of each page and note each measurement as you take it. This can ensure that your notes are as accurate as possible. In addition, make notes about things such as your baby’s overall happiness, appetite, and anything else you think is important.
Consider keeping the book in the same place as any official baby books or notes your doctor gives you. This will help you stay organized and keep track of all of your baby’s measurements.
Take the notes to your baby’s pediatrician appointments if you like. You can ask the doctor any questions you may have about how your measurements and the doctor’s compare.

, Growth and milestone charts can provide you important information about your baby’s growth over time and compared to other babies of the same age and sex. They can track change over time and ensure that your baby grows on his own growth curve. This information can reassure you that your baby is growing at the expected rate and alert you to problems with feeding or other health issues.For this reason, it’s important to use growth and milestone charts from your doctor or another recognized organization such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).Be aware that the CDC, WHO, and UNICEF all use similar charts and may often refer you directly to each respective organization’s website. For example, the CDC suggests using WHO growth charts for children ages 0–24 months.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about interpreting the data on growth charts.

, In addition to using charts from recognized health providers and organizations, you’ll need to make sure you use the right chart for your baby. There are different growth charts for boys and girls as well as for premature babies and babies with certain chromosomal disorders.Be aware that a baby’s ethnicity has no bearing on what growth chart you use.
Recognize that the WHO does not provide information for preemies or babies with chromosomal disorders; however, organizations such as the American Association of Pediatricians and the Child Growth Foundation offer charts for preemies and babies with chromosomal disorders., Take out your notes and compare each measurement you took with the corresponding chart measurements. The charts will have nine percentiles lines that represent the range of growth considered normal for your baby. For example, if your baby’s line is on the 25th percentile line, it means that 25% of babies weigh less than yours and 75% weigh more. Doctors consider babies normal that consistently fall between the the 3rd and 97th percentile lines. The nine percentiles lines are:3rd percentile
5th percentile
10th percentile
25th percentile
50th percentile
75th percentile
90th percentile
95th percentile
97th percentile

, Although doctors consider children between the 3rd and 97th percentile normal, you child may fall above or below these levels for different reasons; however, your doctor may consider your baby’s growth normal so long as he grows along a consistent curve. Speak to your doctor about your baby’s growth curve to ensure that it falls within a consistent and normal range for your baby.


Notice if you baby suddenly goes up or down on his personal curve. If this happens, it may signal developmental problems or a failure to thrive. Contact your baby’s doctor if you see any inconsistent growth on your baby’s curve.

, Skills that babies meet at a certain age are called developmental milestones. These milestones include skills such as standing, walking, smiling, or waving goodbye. Your baby will meet milestones in how she plays, learns, speaks, behaves, and moves. Your doctor will likely ask you about these developments during regular visits. Ask your doctor about what milestones to expect from your baby. You can also access a list of developmental milestones from organizations such as the CDC and WHO. Your baby should reach certain milestones at the following ages:At 2 months, your baby should holding up her head and beginning to push up from his or her tummy
At 4 months, hold her head without support or push down on her legs when the feet are on a hard surface
At 6 months, your baby should begin to sit without support and roll over in both directions—front to back and back to front
At 9 months, your baby should be able to stand while holding something and crawl
At 12 months or 1 year, your baby should pull to a stand or stand alone and walk while holding on to furniture, also called cruising
At 18 months, she should be saying several single words and scribbling

, Remember that your baby is an individual and will not grow in the same way as someone else’s baby, or even your previous children. Watch your baby’s growth and overall well-being and listen to your pediatrician to reassure yourself that your baby is developing normally.


Remember that growth charts are also not a perfect measurement for your baby. Although growth charts are useful, they can’t detect or diagnose specific health problems and don’t account for all of the factors that influence your baby’s growth. For this reason, you should also avoid comparing your baby’s growth chart and developmental milestones with other babies’., In most cases, you can expect that your baby’s growth curve to be consistent; however, if your baby’s curve crosses two centile lines, either upwards or downwards, schedule an appointment with the pediatrician. You should also consult a medical professional if you notice any developmental delays or issues.Inform the doctor about your concerns and provide as much information as possible. This includes any notes you’ve taken during your personal measurements or assessments. Make sure to ask questions if you have them.

, In most cases, babies steadily gain weight and grow quickly; however, in some cases children may grow too quickly or not enough. There are many different reasons for growth disorder, which require a doctor’s diagnosis. Some of the reasons for inconsistent growth include:Chronic diseases
Complications during the mother’s pregnancy
Genetic conditions
Failure to thrive

, Some babies may not grow and gain weight normally after birth. Doctors call this “failure to thrive” and it can happen to any baby.It can be caused by a variety of things such as the child doesn’t get enough to eat or an illness such as gastroesophageal reflux or food intolerance. A mixture of medical problems and environmental factors can also contribute to failure to thrive.In most cases, failure to thrive will go away when a baby starts eating enough food.Be aware that your doctor may diagnose your baby as failing to thrive if he doesn’t gain weight for three months in a row during the first year of life. Give your doctor as much information as you can about your baby’s feedings or household stresses. Your doctor may order tests to see if there are any underlying conditions causing your baby’s failure to thrive.Other factors that your doctor may use to diagnose failure to thrive are: falling below the third percentile for weight on his or her chart and weighing 20% below the ideal weight for his or her height., Your baby’s weight gain and growth are connected. Ensuring that your baby is eating enough and gaining weight can also help her grow in length.Let your baby feed on demand instead of on a strict schedule. Make sure you let your baby feed for as long as she wants.
Check your milk supply and talk to your doctor or a lactation consultant if you have concerns. They may recommend ways to increase your supply or recommend supplementing with formula. This can help ensure your baby is getting enough to eat.Offer more high-calorie food like whole milk cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, eggs, avocados and whole wheat bread and pastas to babies eating solids. Sometimes special high calorie drinks such as Pediasure may be recommended.

, If you are concerned about your baby’s eating habits or inability to grow, consider seeing a specialist. A pediatric dietician or developmental pediatrician can help diagnose, address, and treat any problems with your baby’s growth.


Take all of your baby’s medical records to your appointment. In addition, give the doctor notes about feedings and any problems you’ve encountered with feedings. Answer any questions the specialist may have about your baby’s growth, feedings, or other habits.
Ask the specialist questions you have about treatment options for your baby. You may also have questions on how to best meet your baby’s feeding and growth needs.

",How to Make Apple Baby Food," Because apples are part of the “dirty dozen” and contain lots of pesticides, it is a good idea to purchase organic apples at the grocery store.Pesticides are associated with diseases of the nervous system, the endocrine system, cancer.So when possible, look for organic apples., Avoid tart apples such as Granny Smith, as the flavor can be too strong and unpleasant for babies.Keep in mind that one medium apple will make about five ounces of apple puree., You want apples that are firm, with no soft parts or bruises or wrinkled skin, as this is a sign the apples are not fresh.Remember that fresh apple should only be given to babies one year and older once they develop the ability to chew with their teeth, as apples are hard and a young baby can choke on them., Rub the apples one by one apple with your hands and rinse them well.If you are using sprayed apples rather than organic apples, you can try to remove as much of the pesticides as possible by filling your sink with water and adding one cup of vinegar.Soak the apples in the solution for 10 minutes and pat dry., Your baby cannot chew apple peels so it is necessary to remove them.


If you are using sprayed apples as opposed to organic apples, it is especially important to peel the apples as this will get rid of the pesticides on the peels.

, To do this, first cut an apple in half with a sharp knife. Put the halved peeled apple in your palm and with the tip of a sharp knife, remove the core of the apples, including the seeds. It is important to remove the seeds as your baby could choke on them.

, Do this for the rest of the apples you are going to be using.


To maintain freshness, it's a good idea to store the apples in the refrigerator and cut them up right before you are going to use them.

, Leave it on the stove to boil and then reduce the heat.Let the apples cook for 10 minutes on low heat.
You can also create other varieties of apple puree like an apple and pear puree, which is suitable for babies 6 months and older.In fact, an apple can be mixed with various fruits and vegetables. Depending on your baby’s age, you can prepare apples with carrots, potatoes, plums, pumpkins, fresh mashed banana, and meat., If it is cooked, it will be very soft and turn easily to a pulp.


If the apple is still hard, continue cooking the apples for another minute, until they are soft. #*After 10-15 minutes on the stove, the apples should be cooked. Do not cook them too long because the high temperature kills the vitamins and minerals in the apples., Drain the apples into a bowl and rinse them in cold water to stop the cooking process and preserve as many nutrients as possible.


Save the water from cooking for later use.
Do not add sugar to the apples as they will be sweet enough on their own and do not need any extra sugar.

, If it is too thick, add the water you saved from cooking or a little breastmilk or formula.


If you are preparing applesauce for babies older than 10 months, you can make a puree by crushing the apples with a fork or potato masher as it will not have to be as fine or smooth.

, Let the leftover applesauce cool completely and put in a clean sealed container, where it can stay in the fridge for up to three days.Applesauce made with the formula can be refrigerate for up to 24 hours, as long as it is made with refrigerated prepared formula.Applesauce made with breastmilk can stand in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. After that throw it away.If you are making a big batch of applesauce, the safest option is to add water to the apples and then add breast milk or formula when you reheat the applesauce. This way, it will not to spoil.You can also freeze applesauce for up to 3 months in BPA free plastic containers. Before serving it to your baby, thaw it by putting it in the fridge for 24 hours.

, You’ll need:


2 1/2 cups milk
1 cup water
1 cup rolled oats
2 apples, cleaned and peeled
Apple porridge is suitable for babies 9 months and older., Then, pour the cup of water into a saucepan and set it to boil.

, Cook them for 5 minutes.

, Cook the ingredients on low heat, stirring occasionally.


Let the porridge cook for 10 minutes.
The porridge is ready to serve to your baby when you get a smooth mixture and all the liquid is absorbed.
Make sure it is not too hot before you serve it to your baby.

, This variation on apple porridge with chicken is great for babies 8 months and older. You’ll need:2 cups of water
1 cup chopped apples, cleaned, peeled, and diced
1 chicken breast, diced

, Heat the pan until it boils and then lower the heat.


Let it cook for 20 minutes.

, Pierce an apple with a fork to make sure it is soft. Cut a piece of meat and check the color of the meat inside. If it is white instead of pink, the meat is cooked.


You can also try a piece of meat to make sure it is soft.

, Drain the ingredients and save the water.

, If the mixture is too thick, add a little of the water you saved.


You can also add a bit of homemade chicken soup or broth that does not have a lot of salt.

, To test if the porridge is cool enough, you can put a bit of it on the inner side of your forearm to make sure it is not too hot or try some yourself before feeding it to your baby.

, In fact, without a peel, the apple will turn to mush as you bake it.


Give your baby a baked apple when they are 6 months and older., If you are only feeding one baby for one meal, prepare one apple.


If your baby is 8 months and older, you can put a little butter or sprinkle some cinnamon on the inside of the cores. This will add a little spice and introduce your baby to a new flavor.
Small amounts of cinnamon are not harmful to your baby., Place the halved apples into the dish, with the peels facing up., Check the water level periodically and add more water to the dish if necessary.


The apples are baked when the inside of the apples are soft. Pierce the apples with a fork to check if they are soft and ready to come out of the oven.

, Once they are cool and easy to hold, peel them. Then, crush them with a fork to make a mush or use a spoon to scoop out the baked inside fruit of the apple and offer it to your baby.

Use the board books.,
Engage sound imitation.,
Try every day routine things.,
Consider a torch light: This can be a good bedtime play.",How to Play with a 12 Month Old Baby," Let him/her show you what engages their interest. For this you need to expose the baby to different environments. Different can range from a simple room filled with two or three toys to a walk in the park or a stroll outside your home.;
, Talk to your baby, try to capture her interest by pointing out and naming different objects, or how a toy operates etc.

, It's a good place to start exploring your babies interest. Go to the different sections and observe how your little one reacts. One maybe quiet taken with a soft toy another with a car, and a third with something else entirely different!

, Most babies like playing with water but this is to be done under strict supervision! Or give him/her some clay or dough to play with , after some time they tend to put it inside their mouth so again, this is to be done if you are sure not to take your eyes of the baby even for one second.

, Babies have different taste in music, try different numbers and see which one catches your babies attention. Pick him/her up and sway gentle, some giggle and sway along, while others find it annoying. Keep up the light moves if your baby seems to enjoy it

, Hide behind a little piece of cloth and emerge with a smile or interesting sounds, surprise the baby,don't startle! If she shows interest let her do the hiding. Again do this with caution, don't leave the baby's face covered in cloth, as this could cause breathing hazard or even scare her.

Give up your baby for adoption if you find parenting too stressful in general.",How to Prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome1," This condition is often accidental, but can severely injure or kill a child.At least 1 in 4 shaken babies die.
Those that survive may experience blindness, cerebral palsy, intellectual/developmental delays, seizures, and other conditions.
Experts warn that shaking a baby is similar to shaking a half-empty container of water: the contents crash around inside, even after the shaking is done. Even one or two shakes can be devastating to a baby's brain.

People can be sent to prison for shaking a baby.;
, This includes long, inconsolable bouts of crying. It's typical, and it'll get better as the baby gets older.You are not a bad caregiver if your baby cries a lot (or if you get frustrated by it). It is how babies communicate., Family members, babysitters, and other people who look after the baby should know how to treat them right.Tell them what soothes the baby best (for example, maybe she loves being put on top of the washing machine or being danced to sleep).
Tell them what to do if the baby is still crying. You could even print off this article.
Screen daycare providers and babysitters, and don't leave your baby with someone who may lose control.
Teach children to be very gentle with babies, especially their heads.

, Make sure that you are getting enough time to sleep in. Exhaustion can make it harder to deal with stress. Take turns with your partner or another caregiver.

Try working out an arrangement where you take turns dealing with the baby each night, or one person handles the baby before midnight and the other handles the baby after.
Take time for yourself whenever you can. You're allowed to take breaks.

, Parenting is hard, and it's okay not to have it together all the time. Classes can help you be prepared for the different stressors, and know how to deal with problems that might arise., Parenting can be difficult, especially looking after a baby. You don't have to face this alone.

Would any grandparents, neighbors, or friends be willing to babysit?
Would they be willing to bring over a meal or help with chores?

, You don't have to raise a child if you aren't ready or willing.

In the United States, you can surrender a baby to a safe haven.

Talk to your baby’s doctor.,
Offer peanuts at the appropriate age.,
Avoid whole nuts and large amounts of peanut products.,
Provide a first taste of peanuts.,
Introduce more peanuts gradually.,
Offer peanut products in different ways.,
Recognize the signs of a severe reaction.,
Monitor for peanut allergy symptoms.,
See your baby’s doctor.",How to Introduce Your Baby to Peanuts," Before you introduce peanuts to your baby, talk to your pediatrician. Your doctor can confirm that it is safe for your baby to try peanuts, especially if they have other food allergies or eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis).Answer any questions your pediatrician may have about family history with peanuts. If you or the baby’s other parent has a peanut allergy, the baby may also have one.Recognize that your doctor may refer your baby to an allergist to test for potential allergies and develop a plan to introduce solid foods.;
, Parents have increasingly delayed giving their baby peanuts and peanut products. However, you don’t need to wait years to give your child peanuts. Instead, introduce peanuts into your child’s diet between the ages of 4-11 months.This may prevent your baby from developing a peanut allergy in the long term.Feed your baby peanuts only after they have had and tolerated other solid foods.
Give your baby small amounts of creamy peanut butter as early as 4-6 months if they are eating solid foods., Because peanuts are small and hard, they can pose a choking hazard for infants and toddlers. Steer clear of giving your baby whole peanuts until they are older and able to chew and swallow the peanuts whole. You should also avoid giving your baby large amounts of peanut products such as peanut butter to prevent choking.Recognize that you should not give a child whole nuts until your child is four. If you want to introduce nuts at a younger age, you should chop them into tiny pieces., The best way to introduce your baby to peanuts is through peanut butter. When your baby is comfortable with solid foods, give them a tiny bit of peanut butter on the tip of your finger. A thin layer spread on your fingertip is enough to see if your baby reacts to it while minimize the risk of choking on larger amounts.Only give your baby creamy or smooth peanut butter. Do not give them chunky peanut, which can be a choking hazard.
Give your baby their first taste of peanut butter at home so you can control the situation. This may give you a bit more ease than letting your child have their first taste of peanuts at day care or in a restaurant., Wait a few days before giving your baby another taste of peanut butter or a different peanut product. This gives you the chance to see if your baby has any reaction before introducing more peanuts.Wait at least 3 days before you give your baby any more peanut products. Only let your baby have more if you didn’t notice a reaction.

, You don’t need to stick to letting your baby lick peanut butter off of your finger. Instead, you can try all sorts of different ways to introduce peanuts to your baby’s diet. Some additional ways to offer your baby peanut products include:Tossing noodles with a teaspoon of peanut butter
Blending a banana with a tablespoon of peanut butter
Mixing peanut butter thoroughly into your baby’s cereal, yogurt, or applesauce
Spreading a very thin layer of peanut butter on to a piece of toast or a crackerStirring peanut butter into purees or smoothies

, Although rare, peanuts are the most likely food to cause anaphylaxis, which causes the airways to swell and blood pressure to drop, and even death.Paying attention to your baby’s behavior after eating peanuts or peanut products can help you quickly identify and get prompt treatment for a serious reaction. This can minimize the risk of anaphylaxis or more serious complications. Call 911 and seek immediate medical attention if your baby has any of the following symptoms after eating peanuts or peanut products:Trouble breathing
Itchy mouth and throat
Pale, bluish complexion
Low pulse
Loss of consciousness

, In most cases, your baby won’t have a severe reaction to peanuts. But they may still have an allergic reaction to peanuts. Just as it is important to watch for a severe reaction, you should also check your baby for other symptoms of a peanut allergy. Common symptoms of a peanut allergy include:Rashes or hives
Swelling around the mouth and face
Abdominal cramps
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Sneezing or a stuffy nose
Coughing or wheezing
Itchy eyes, Most mild peanut allergy symptoms clear up after a few hours, especially with the help of an antihistamine. If you recognize or suspect any signs or symptoms of a peanut allergy in your baby, call your pediatrician immediately. Your doctor will let you know the best way to handle the reaction. This might include giving your baby an antihistamine suitable for their age, providing you with an an epinephrine auto-injector (also known as an epi-pen), or teaching you how to avoid peanuts.Make sure to give the doctor or their office any important information such as your baby’s symptoms and what the baby ate.
Consult your baby’s doctor before giving them an antihistamine for a reaction to peanuts. If the condition worsens, seek emergency care.

Educate yourself about the iron needs of babies who are breastfed.,
Learn about breastfeeding and supplements.,
Provide iron supplements to your baby.,
Take supplements.",How to Give Your Baby the Right Amount of Iron1," While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends breastfeeding when possible, the AAP has also noted that breast milk alone may not supply babies with enough iron during their first year of life. Consider that:


Breast milk contains very little iron.
Babies who breastfeed are at a higher risk of developing iron deficiency after four months of age than babies who are given formula.
The longer you continue to breastfeed, the more iron supplementation your baby may need.;
, Because breast milk contains very little iron, babies who are breastfed should be given an iron supplement.


Without some sort of iron supplement in their diet, a baby who is breastfed may become iron deficient.
Breastfeeding babies should be given 1 mg of liquid iron supplement per kilogram of body weight a day between four and six months of age. Do not start supplementation earlier than four months.
Make sure you do not provide too much iron to your baby, or they may get iron poisoning. This can affect their heart, lungs, and liver.Follow advised guidelines and your pediatrician’s guidance as close as you can, and do not give more iron unless you are specifically instructed to do so.
Talk to your pediatrician if you have any questions at all., After learning about iron supplements, you'll have to administer some to your baby. While the process is fairly simple, there are some things you should consider.Ask your pediatrician to recommend or prescribe iron supplements for your child.
Begin administering iron supplement after your baby is four months old (unless your doctor recommends earlier). Continue providing supplements until your baby is regularly eating solid, iron-enriched foods, generally around six months.
Drop 1 mg of the supplement per kilogram of body weight into a small amount of water, breastmilk, or another liquid. You can also use a dropper to put it directly into your baby's mouth.
Do not exceed the recommended dose unless your doctor tells you to do so., Nursing mothers with certain dietary restrictions or problems may need to take supplements. Ultimately, while the baby does not get much iron from breastmilk, it is still important to maintain healthy iron levels while nursing.


Women on vegan or vegetarian diets should take a B-complex supplement.
Women who have a history of iron deficiency or anemia should take iron supplements.
Consult your doctor if you have any questions about supplements you should take when breastfeeding."

Keep your baby on breast or formula milk for 6 months before introducing solids.,
Consider what allergies already exist within your immediate family, including your own strong reactions to certain foods.,
Avoid known food triggers when beginning your baby on solids.,
Look for organic food choices.,
Cease feeding your baby anything that causes a reaction.,
Be pragmatic as your child grows up.",How to Know Which Foods to Avoid in Baby's First Year," The baby's digestive system remains immature for the first 6 months of life and milk is perfect for it.;
, These experiences and existing family allergies serve as an excellent indicator of foods that should be treated with great care with respect to your child; seek advice from your health professional as to appropriate times to introduce such foods.

, There are some key foods that can precipitate allergic reactions if introduced too early in a child's life. Consider holding off on the following foods for at least the first year of your baby's life (and possibly longer if there are known family allergies):Dairy products - the protein in cow's milk is hard for a baby's digestive system to break down
Wheat - this includes products made using wheat flour
Honey - honey can contain botulism spores; when we are older, our digestive system can cope with these but babies' systems cannot, and it can be life-threatening.Soy - dairy-sensitive babies are often soy-sensitive also and the jury is still out on the safety of heavy soy usage for babies
Egg whites - leave cooked egg whites until later and be very wary of raw egg whites at all ages; egg yolks are fine
Peanuts and peanut butter - only introduce later. If there is a family history of peanut allergy, seek professional advice; you may need to delay introduction for years.
Shellfish - can trigger allergies for lifetime if developed early; family history is a good indicatorTree nuts - this includes pecans, hazelnuts, almonds, pistachios, macadamia nuts, pine nuts, cashew nuts and walnuts; nuts can also get caught in a baby and young child's airways, so are best left until your child understands to chew thoroughly
Citrus fruits - these can cause rashes. This is especially likely with a family history.Strawberries and berries - strawberries contain a protein that is difficult for babies to digestChocolate - the caffeine and dairy content are not appropriate for baby's digestive system; it can also cause headaches and a babe with a sore head is very unhappy indeed
Yeast - a common allergen

, Preferring organic foods lowers the potential for introducing pesticide traces into your baby's diet. Although not always possible, there are some foods that are better organically grown or raised than using conventional methods.

, Seek medical advice as soon as possible. Common symptoms of a bad reaction include vomiting, rashes, diarrhea, coughing, wheezing, excess wind, hives, constipation, runny eyes, swollen mouth, or a painful stomach. Sometimes it can be hard to pinpoint the exact problem and if your child is in daycare or with other carers, you may need to quiz the carers as to what your child is eating. Avoid the temptation to believe that your baby will ""grow out of it""; at this early age, it is more likely to develop a permanent inability to cope with the food and reintroducing it later in life is much better than to persist now.

, While it is crucial to ban certain food from your child's diet where it is life-threatening or produces pain and illness, it is also important to weigh the consequences of preventing your child eating certain things; for example, if a rash forms after eating citrus fruit but it is not bothering your child and is merely temporary, it may be better to let the child eat oranges and gain the nutrients than to ban yet another food and have your child watching others eat it. Seek advice from your health professional in reaching your decision.

Look for clues.,
Prepare runny cereal.,
Let them be comfortable with it.,
Experiment proportions.,
Stop when they stop.",How to Introduce Cereal to a Baby," Before your baby advances from a straight milk diet to foods, ask your baby's pediatrician or dietitian for approval to start. These are clues to see if your baby is ready.
Positioning: keeping their head up and sitting with little or no support. A helpful tip is to use highchairs, including restaurant ones, and stuff blankets around the baby to help position themselves.



 


Mouth actions: a baby doesn't need to start teething before starting foods, but they may be pre-teething though. They may also start grabbing everything in their reach and pulling it to their mouths or constantly sucking on their fingers. A good clue is when they start to gnaw, not just suck, on things.






Food interest: they may see your table food and stare at it as if they want it and may bring their hands and arms out to reach for something.






Weight gain: doubling their birth weight is a plus in starting foods.;
, The first cereal feeding should be very runny or liquidity. Measure 1 tablespoon of cereal and mix it with 4 to 5 tablespoons of formula or breast milk. Never use cow's milk for small babies.

, Scoop a very small amount of cereal with a spoon and place it around their mouth & nose. Let them smell and lap the spoon with their tongues. You can also ""shovel"" or ""scoop"" up any dribble around the mouth and chin and place it back into the mouth. Make it interesting for them; distract them with the television or make sounds as you're feeding them.

, When the baby accepts cereal, try to see if they'll accept their meal if you increase the cereal amount or decrease the formula/breast milk amount.


When they begin fruits and vegetables, you may scoop mashed bananas and add them to their cereal.

, If the baby has no interest, seems full, or doesn't accept it, stop with the feeding. Discard any leftovers immediately.

Learn about the iron needs of babies on formula.,
Look at different formulas.,
Transition your baby to baby food.,
Feed your baby table food.",How to Give Your Baby the Right Amount of Iron2," Studies have shown that most babies need more iron than their mothers can provide through breastfeeding. Thus, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other similar groups have endorsed providing infants with at least some iron supplementation through formula during their first months of life.


Whether your baby relies entirely on formula or relies on it as a supplement, formula should have added iron.
Most commercially available formulas contain enough iron for babies born on time and without serious medical conditions.
Consult your doctor if you have any questions about your baby’s iron needs and their formula., There are a wide variety of formulas available to ensure babies have enough iron in their diet. Ultimately, though, all formula given to babies should contain iron supplements.


Formula that contains added iron may be labeled “with iron” or “iron fortified.”
Avoid low-iron formula or milk until your baby is over a year old.
Your doctor may recommend a specific formula., Between four and six months, you’ll begin to transition your baby from breastmilk or formula to solid food. This is an important transition, and you must continue to consider your baby’s iron needs during it.


Consider iron-fortified baby cereal.
Buy baby food fortified with iron.
Talk to your pediatrician about the iron content of baby food. They may be able to recommend something., After eight months or so, you should begin the process of transitioning your baby to table food. You'll know if your baby is ready for table food if they are very proactive at meal time, if they play with their spoon, or if they mash or lump their food. When transitioning to table food, feed your baby foods rich in iron like:


Poultry, beef, pork, chicken, or fish
Eggs
Lentils, beans, or tofu
Iron-fortified baby cereal
Baby food fortified with iron."

Monitor your iron levels during pregnancy.,
Ask your pediatrician about iron levels in newborn babies.,
Schedule follow-up visits.,
Run diagnostics.,
Look for symptoms of iron deficiency.",How to Give Your Baby the Right Amount of Iron3," Perhaps the most important thing you can do to make sure your baby has enough iron is to make sure they get it while in the womb. This is important, as babies acquire all the iron they need for the first four months of life while in the womb.


Have your doctor check your iron levels while you are pregnant.
Be specially cognizant of your iron levels if you are anemic, have other blood diseases, or are on a vegan or vegetarian diet.
Take iron supplements if your levels are low.
Stay proactive about monitoring your own health during pregnancy. If you're not healthy, your baby won't get everything they need before birth., Based on factors unique to your baby, your pediatrician will make recommendations about how you should maintain healthy iron levels for your baby. In the end, your pediatrician has the substantial experience needed to determine your baby's iron needs.


If you are concerned about iron levels, ask your pediatrician. For instance, say “since my baby was about two weeks premature, does she need iron supplements?”
Healthy babies born full-term already have enough iron for the first four months after birth.
Babies born premature may need iron supplements during the first four months after birth., If your doctor is concerned about your child’s iron levels for some reason, they’ll recommend follow up visits. These visits will allow them to keep a closer eye on your baby. Your doctor will recommend frequent follow-ups if:


Your baby is born premature.
Your baby is anemic or has a similar blood disorder.
You choose to breastfeed and you are anemic, iron-deficient, or are on a special (restrictive) diet., Regardless of whether your baby has a blood-related condition, was premature, or was born healthy and full-term, your doctor will recommend diagnostics to monitor the overall health of your baby – including their iron levels.


Doctors will run blood panels on your baby if there are any special circumstances, like premature birth.
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening all babies at 12 months for iron deficiency and anemia., Iron deficiency in babies often manifests as anemia, a condition where red blood cells can’t provide enough oxygen to the baby’s body. Anemia can be a life-threatening condition if not treated properly. Signs of iron deficiency related anemia include:


Paleness
Weakness
Excessive tiredness
Rapid heartbeat
Decreased appetite
Swollen tongue
Brittle nails."

Trust your baby to eat when she's hungry.,
Don't be concerned by a picky eater.,
Limit spitting up and reflux.,
Be aware of potential intolerances.",How to Get an Infant to Eat More1," If you are think that your baby is not eating enough, or seems to only feed for very short periods of time, there is not necessarily a cause for concern. There are many reasons why a baby might refuse food, ranging from simply already being full, to being tired, distracted, or a little ill. Try to trust your baby and avoid making feeding time into a battle. If you are concerned, and she if appears underweight or the change is dramatic or sudden, don't hesitate to talk to your doctor., It is not uncommon for a baby to turn her nose up at a new and unfamiliar food. In most cases she will grow out of this, but that can take a while. Be patient, and if she rejects something, offer her something you know she likes. Return to the new food later.She might also be avoiding the food for other reasons, such as teething, tiredness, or just already being full.
Don't get restless and annoyed with her. Just set the new food aside and come back to it later.

, Spitting up is a common occurrence for babies as they get used to digesting food, and tends to reduce as they become a year old. Frequent spitting up can interfere with your baby's diet, so taking steps to reduce spitting up will help her get into good eating habits. Be sure to burp her regularly, don't overfeed her, and keep her upright when you feed her. It is also advisable to avoid playing with her immediately after eating so she has time to digest a bit.


To manage reflux, feed her a bit more slowly, and a little bit less at each meal. Keep her upright for half an hour after eating, by sitting her in a chair or buggy.
If she spits up often, throws up violently, or is increasingly sick, you should contact your doctor., Food intolerances or allergies could be one reason why your baby might not seem to be eating as much. Allergies can appear suddenly, and will often have very noticeable symptoms, such as vomiting, a rash, diarrhoea, sweating, or stomach pain. Food intolerances may produce less severe symptoms, but can result in your baby feeling bloated, gassy, and uncomfortable.If she has a allergy or intolerance she will most likely not want to eat, so look out for any symptoms and contact your doctor.
Your doctor will be able to run tests to investigate a potential allergy.Take your baby to the doctor or emergency room immediately if you see signs of wheezing, swelling, hives, or trouble breathing.

Start by introducing the baby to only one vegetable.,
Introduce solid food only if the child is healthy.

,
Give your child the new product only in the morning at breakfast.,
Boil vegetables for 15 minutes or steam them for 5-10 minutes until they are very soft.,
First give vegetables, then fruits.,
Use plastic, soft-tipped spoons to avoid gum injuries.

,
Let the baby try the vegetable 10-15 times so that he will get accustomed to it.

,
Start with only one spoon a day of a new puree.,
From the second week, add one spoon of a new veggie (or fruit), in addition to the first one.,
Create an order of foods to introduce to your baby.",How to Introduce Solids to a Breastfed Baby," Just give the child the plain cooked vegetable without adding any salt, sugar, corn starch, or other food thickening.;
,, If the baby is going to have any negative reaction, then you will have time to take necessary measures.

, Then blend them very well; the result should be a liquid. After 8-10 months, you can make a thicker texture with small, soft pieces of veggies. For cooking, you can use a Beaba babycook, which steams, blends and warms food.

, The fruits will be sweet, so babies will surely prefer them and may refuse veggies. The pureed food should be warm.

,,, Then, you may give either breast milk or formula. The next day, add another spoon. On the third day, three spoons. The traditional method includes one kind of puree per week, which equals to seven spoons by the end of the week, though you may only do it on five consecutive days.

, By the end of the first month, you will be able to change one milk or formula feeding to puree in the morning.

, One regular order of vegetables and fruits that you can introduce to your child is squash/zucchini, broccoli/cauliflower, carrot, pumpkin, and potato, apples, pears, sweet potato and peaches. Here's how you can do it:


On the first week, you will introduce squash/ zucchini.
On the second week, you will give 1 teaspoon of broccoli + 7 tea spoons of squash, 2 tea spoons of broccoli + 7 tea spoons of squash, 3 tea spoons of broccoli + 7 tea spoons of squash and so on until 7 tea spoons of broccoli + 7 tea spoons of squash.
On the third week, the first puree should be replaced with a new one, so on the 15th day, you will give 1 teaspoon of carrot + 7 tea spoons of broccoli, then 2 tea spoons of carrot + 7 tea spoons of broccoli, and so on.

Make new foods look like an established favourite.,
Offer finger food.,
Make the most of mealtimes.,
Involve more people.,
Give her plenty of variety.",How to Get an Infant to Eat More2," If you find that she is regularly rejecting a new and unfamiliar food without tasting it, you can try to put her at ease by making the new food appear similar to one of her favourites. For example, if she is big fan of mashed potatoes, but doesn't like the look of sweet potato, try mashing it up so it has the same consistency.


Try to ease her in with small portions that you gradually increase over time.Introducing new foods gradually, and not trying to force anything on her, will help her develop her tastes gradually.
A completely new food can be a very strange sensation for a baby.

, You can try to increase the amount she eats throughout the day by offering her small amounts of finger food between meals. Soft cooked vegetables are good choices for finger foods, as are washed and peeled fruits. If your baby is more than six months old, you can also try dry food such as graham crackers and melba toast. Noodles are also a good finger food.


Don't offer food that may cause choking. Avoid apple chunks, grapes, popcorn, hot dogs, nuts, or hard chunks of uncooked vegetables.
Avoid salty or sugary foods.
If your baby is around 6-8 months and is teething, toast strips, teething biscuits, and unsalted crackers can make good finger foods.

, Your baby will copy a lot of what you do, so eating together can encourage her. She will watch you carefully and learn from what you are doing. If she turns away from the spoon, eat it yourself to show her how tasty it is. Talk to her when you feed her, and include her in family mealtimes. Having regular mealtimes can help your baby learn what time is food time.


You should expect some mess, and make sure you keep mealtimes fun.
Be sure to allow plenty of time for eating, and be patient. Go at your baby's pace, and don't try to rush or force her to eat something.Don't leave the table until she has finished eating too., Sometimes bringing in more people to a mealtime can encourage your baby to eat more. This can work well if you have an adult friend or family member who she likes. Get your friend along for dinner and your baby will often eat happily for someone who isn't mum or dad.


If she has some friends that are good eaters, inviting them round for dinner can also have the same effect., It's important to provide plenty of variety so she has a healthy balanced diet, and gets introduced to all sorts of different foods at a young age.Generally, once babies get used to new foods they will learn to like them. Give your baby a good range of healthy foods at a young age to help her grow and develop, as well as get into good dietary habits. Giving her foods and drinks with added sugar, salt, or fat, will increase the chances of her wanting these in the future.


Providing a variety of foods, and allowing her to choose what to eat for a particular meal, can help her get used to a new foods.
Babies like to choose foods themselves, so try to give her a choice every now and again."

Find out how often a baby up to four months old can feed.,
Provide more food less frequently after four months.,
Recognise the signs to introduce solids.,
Introduce solid foods.,
Bring in strained fruit and vegetables.,
Move on to meat.",How to Get an Infant to Eat More3," When your baby is this young, all her nutritional needs will be met with breast milk or formula. If you are breastfeeding, a baby may nurse around 8-12 times a day, approximately every 2-4 hours, or when they are hungry and demand feeding.


If you are using formula, your baby may need to eat 6-8 times a day. Newborns will start with a daily consumption of about 16-24 ounces, with about 1 ounce per serving for the first week, and 2-3 ounces per serving after the first week of life.
If the baby does not feed enough during the day, waking her at night to feed may be necessary if she is underweight.
Maintain close contact with your doctor so she can monitor your baby and advise on the action you should take.

, By the time your baby has reached around four months, she will begin to cut back on the number of times she feeds each day. If you are breastfeeding, she may now feed 4-6 times a day, rather than 8-12. The amount of milk she consumes at each meal will, however, increase.


If you are using formula the number of feedings will also decrease as she gets older. To adjust to this, the amount of formula you provide for each meal will go up to around 6-8 ounces.
By the time the baby is 4-6 months old, she should be consuming around 28-45 ounces of formula a day, and you can begin the transition to solid food.

, When your baby is around 4-6 months old you will be preparing to start transitioning her to solid foods. You need to take care and not try to rush this change. If your baby is not physically able to deal with solid foods, there is a risk that she could choke. There are a number of milestones in her development that may indicate she is ready to solids:


Her weight has doubled since she was born.
She has good control of her head and neck.
She can sit up with a bit of support.
She doesn't keep pushing the spoon or food out with her tongue.
She can indicate to you that she is full by not opening her mouth, or turning her head away from food.
She is beginning to show interest in food when she sees that other people are eating.

, When you begin to introduce solids into her diet, use a iron-fortified baby rice cereal, which you have mixed with breast milk or formula. Make sure it is mixed to a thin consistency in the early stages. As she becomes more adept with solids you can use a thicker consistency.


To start with, mix one or two teaspoons with the breast milk or formula. Offer this as a serving twice a day.
Gradually increase the amount of cereal you mix in to 3 or 4 tablespoons, once or twice a day.
Once she is eating cereal regularly and routinely you can try bringing in other instant cereals, such as oats, wheat, or barley.
Carefully control the new cereals and don't introduce more than one new cereal every 3-4 days. With each new one watch for intolerances and allergies.
There is some disagreement amongst experts about in what order to introduce new foods. Experts do agree that you should introduce your baby to a wide variety of new foods, but there is no scientific consensus about in what order they need to be introduced.Some people begin with fruits or vegetables, while some even start with meats. Talk to your pediatrician if you are thinking about trying a different order of starting foods.

, When your baby is around 6-8 months old and has successfully mastered a variety of cereals, you can begin to introduce more variation to her diet with strained fruits and vegetables. As with the cereals, introduce them one at a time and wait a few days before adding another food so you can check for allergies or intolerances.


It's best to start with plain vegetables, such as peas, potatoes, squash, and carrots. For fruits, you can start with banana, apricots, apple sauce, and pears.
You might want to start with vegetables first, as some people believe that the sweetness of fruits might make the vegetables less appealing.
Offer 3-4 servings a day of 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of vegetables and fruits. Depending on the child, the total amount she might consume per day can vary from 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) all the way to 2 cups.
Although her consumption of breast milk or formula will be falling, you should continue to offer it 3-5 times a day.

, When your baby is around 6-8 months old, she will be eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, and will be ready for some strained or finely chopped meat. If you have been breastfeeding your baby, 6-8 months is the appropriate age to introduce meat. Breast milk is not a rich source of iron, and by 6-8 months her iron stores will need replenishing.


You should continue to offer breast milk or formula 3-4 times a day. Your baby should, however, be off the bottle by 1 year old. Any bottle you use after 1 year should just contain water.
Introduce meats one at a time, and allow a full week before you offer a new meat. Offer the meat in 3–4 tablespoon (44.4–59.1 ml) servings.
Increase the serving size of fruits and vegetables to 3–4 tablespoons (44.4–59.1 ml), four times each day.
You can also feed her cooked egg yolk (not white), 3 or 4 times a week.

Discuss your baby’s issues with their doctor.,
Switch your baby’s formula.,
Eliminate dairy from your diet.,
Feed your infant plenty of liquids.",How to Handle Milk Allergy or Intolerance in Infants1," If you think your baby has a milk allergy or intolerance, you should first talk to their doctor. Your child’s doctor can confirm whether this is what is making your baby sick. They can also recommend the best way to go about changing your baby’s diet and possibly tell you which formulas are best for your baby.

Be prepared to discuss your baby’s diet and symptoms with your doctor. It might help to write down what they eat and how it affects them for a week or two before the appointment.;
, If your infant has a milk allergy or intolerance, you will need to eliminate milk and milk proteins from their diet. Doing so will keep them from having an allergic reaction or suffering symptoms of intolerance, like diarrhea, spitting up, or gas. If you are bottle-feeding your baby, this means you’ll need to switch their formula to one that does not contain milk products. In general, switching to a hydrolysate formula in which the milk proteins are already broken down is recommended.Formulas that do not contain milk are still a great source of nutrients for infants and many doctors will recommend continuing to feed it to children who are on restricted diets because of allergies well into their toddler years.Switching to a soy-based formula or goat’s milk is not usually a good solution. Many babies that are allergic to milk are also allergic to these things., If you are breastfeeding, you should eliminate dairy from your diet. This includes such things as milk, butter, cheese, cottage cheese, half-and-half, pudding, sour cream, and yogurt. You should talk to your doctor about what foods to eliminate, as well as what foods to supplement your diet with to ensure you’re still getting enough calcium and other nutrients.Be sure to read the labels on the food you are eating. Food manufacturers are required to state if their product contains milk or milk products., Diarrhea is a symptom of milk intolerance and can cause your baby to become dehydrated. When your baby is having significant diarrhea, make sure you are providing them with plenty of liquids, such as Pedialyte®, Naturalyte®, and Infalyte® if their recommended formula isn’t effective.Refrain from giving your child fruit juices that are high in sugar, as these may cause your baby to become more dehydrated.

Check with your pediatrician if you are concerned that your baby may be getting dehydrated or if you want to know which liquids are safe for your baby to have.

Feed your baby slowly and in smaller portions.,
Increase skin-to-skin contact with your baby.,
Dress your baby in loose-fitting, natural materials.,
Create a comfortable, soothing environment for your baby.",How to Handle Milk Allergy or Intolerance in Infants2," When you’re feeding your baby, try to make sure they are drinking slowly, not gulping their formula or breastmilk. It might help for you to pause from time to time while you’re feeding them. In addition, feeding your baby several smaller meals throughout the day, rather a couple large meals, might help them slow down when they’re feeding. Doing these things can help ease reflux and gas, both of which a baby might experience when they have a milk intolerance.

Also, try to keep the nipple on the bottle you are using to feed full of milk. This will help cut down on the amount of bubbles your baby might ingest while they’re feeding, which can help reduce reflux and gas.
Keep your baby in an upright position for a while after feeding to let the food digest and burp your baby after each meal., If you’re dealing with colic-like symptoms, or excessive crying, try increasing the amount of skin-to-skin contact you have with your baby. You can try carrying them in a sling with them pressed against your body as you walk around or massaging your baby’s skin., Children who have a milk allergy or intolerance sometimes also suffer from rashes. Dress your baby in natural materials and avoid tight-fitting clothing to prevent further rash irritation. Avoiding tight-fitting clothes can also help with reflux.

If your baby continually scratches at the rash, keep their nails cut short and invest in some anti-scratch mittens.

, Making sure your baby is as relaxed as possible can help ease its symptoms as well. Play soft music or soothing sounds, like the sounds of a fan or a heartbeat, to help comfort them. In addition, try using rhythmic motions to soothe them, such as rocking them or placing them in a vibrating infant carrier."

Use an epinephrine auto-injector immediately.,
Take your baby to the emergency room.,
Call 911.",How to Handle Milk Allergy or Intolerance in Infants3," If your child displays symptoms like swelling of the mouth, tongue, or throat, trouble breathing, or symptoms involving two different parts of the body (like hives and diarrhea), they may be having a serious allergic reaction to milk. Inject them with an epinephrine auto-injector as soon as possible. An epinephrine auto-injector contains prescription medication in a container about the size of a pen. Ask your doctor to show you how to use it correctly.

Keep in mind that a severe reaction usually happens immediately after ingesting milk, but it can happen hours later.
Keep two epinephrine pens on hand in case of an emergency., Even if you have injected your baby with the epinephrine pen, you should take them to the emergency room after a severe allergic reaction. It is important that your infant is under medical supervision, even if it seems like the worst has already passed. It is possible to have a second wave of severe reactions hours after the initial reaction.Be prepared to discuss your child’s allergies with the emergency room doctor so they can administer care without causing further complications.

, If you are unsure what to do when your child has a severe allergic reaction or are unable to get them to the hospital immediately, call 911 to help. The operator can walk you through the steps you need to take to help your child and send an ambulance to take them to the emergency room.

Every second counts in an allergic reaction so it is best not to risk that your child can wait to see a doctor or be treated."

Encourage a good latch.,
Recognize when your baby is latching correctly.,
Cope with the pain.,
Fix issues with biting.,
See a doctor for intense pain in your breasts.,
Seek outside support.,
Be vigilant about mastitis.",How to Fix Common Baby Feeding Problems1," If you're having trouble getting your baby to latch, you may be feeding them before they're hungry. Try to schedule breastfeeding sessions when your baby is actively displaying signs of hunger.Your baby may suck on their lips, finger, or fist.
They may fuss or fidget.
Babies cry if they're very hungry, and a hungry, distressed baby will be harder to breastfeed. For the best results, try to address hunger when your baby first starts fussing or sucking on their lips, fingers, or fists.;
, If you're still getting used to breastfeeding, or are struggling with latching, sit on a good chair that provides back support and rest your feet on a stool. To encourage the baby to get in the right position, use a breastfeeding pillow or a pile of pillows in your home.You and the baby should be tummy to tummy at all times.
The baby's ears, shoulders, and hips should be in alignment.
Make sure the baby's nose is opposite the nipple.
If this position is not working, you can try using an alternate position. For example, you might try cradling the baby across your lap as they breastfeed., Once you're in position, you can encourage the baby to latch. A baby that's struggling to latch may need some guidance.Keeping your fingers away from your nipples, turn your breast toward the baby in a ""C"" or ""U"" position.
You want your baby to latch naturally, so aim the nipple at their nose or lip. Do not try to force the nipple in the baby's mouth.
If your baby still hesitates to latch, tickle the lip with the nipple gently.
When your baby does open their mouth, gently slip the nipple in. Most of the lower part of the your nipple should be in their mouth and the baby's nose should be sunk slightly into the skin above the nipple. The baby's lips should be fleshed out on either side, like fish lips.

, You want to make sure the baby is getting enough food while latching. You may have to encourage the baby to latch again if they're not latching properly. The following indicate a good latch:You can see the baby's tongue at the bottom of their lip.
Their ears wiggle.
Their jaw is wiggling.
You can hear swallowing noises.
There is little discomfort.

, Breastfeeding can hurt some women. If you experience frequent pain when breastfeeding, take steps to reduce tenderness and soreness to your nipples and breasts.Tuck cabbage leaves into your bra between feedings. This may reduce some swelling and soreness.
Treat your breasts with care between sessions. Wear breast pads if you leak between sessions and change them often. When bathing or showering, avoid getting harsh soaps or shampoos near your breasts., Unfortunately, some babies do bite when they breastfeed. If biting is an issue with your baby, do not pull back as this can cause your baby to bite harder. Instead, push the baby into your breast as this is more likely to cause them to let go as it reduces airflow.If you notice the baby getting ready to bite, gently stick your finger in the corner of their mouth to prevent biting.

, Breastfeeding should not be intensely painful. There may be issues with you or your baby if your have very sore, sensitive breasts and nipples during breastfeeding. Certain problems should be addressed by a medical professional.Plugged ducts can cause very sore spots on one area of the breast. They can also cause red spots to appear on the breast. Such issues should be handled by a doctor.
Pink nipples and shooting pain in your breasts can indicate an infection of you or your baby. You should consult a doctor for evaluation.

, If you continue to struggle with breastfeeding, you should seek outside support. Find a lactation support group in your community by checking at your local hospital. You can also seek lactation support groups online. If you're worried your baby is not getting enough nutrition due to breastfeeding issues, make an appointment with a lactation specialist.

, Mastitis is an infection of the breast tissue that can be caused by breast feeding. It is marked by tenderness, swelling, redness, burning, and pain in the breasts. You will also experience flu-like symptoms, including a fever. Mastitis should be addressed by a doctor.Usually, painkillers and antibiotics are used to treat the infection. You should take all the pills as directed to properly treat mastitis.
Your doctor may also want to talk over your breastfeeding techniques with you. They may have suggestions about preventing a reoccurrence of mastitis.

Introduce your child to the right foods at the right time.,
Use formula or breast milk to stop spitting issues.,
Avoid forcing food if your baby's not hungry.,
Be patient with new foods.,
Consult your doctor if issues persist.",How to Fix Common Baby Feeding Problems2," You should not attempt to feed your baby solid foods until the age of six months. After this, you can expose your baby to small amounts of healthy foods, like fruits and vegetables, in addition to breast milk.Pureed fruits and vegetables are usually good foods for babies, as they'll help your baby get a taste for healthy food early on. These may be labeled as ""stage one"" on store-bought baby foods. Some pediatricians encourage introducing vegetables before fruits.Grain cereal is also a popular choice, as it's a healthy finger food your baby can easily eat.
Baby foods made with meat can be helpful if your baby has been breastfeeding. The vitamins may be easier to consume in meat.

, If your baby is spitting food out with every bite, they may not yet have outgrown their tongue-thrust instincts. These are instincts that prevent a baby from choking. You can address this issue by adding breast milk, formula, or water to whatever food you're serving.Adding liquid will help thin out food. This will make your baby less likely to feel they have to push it out to prevent choking.
Instead of using a spoon, dab some food on your finger and feed your baby this way.

, If your baby is turning their head away when you offer food, they may simply not be hungry. You can try offering a different type of food, but if your baby still refuses do not push it. Your baby will likely eat once they're hungry.Children often have a better sense of when they need to eat than adults. While adults may eat out of boredom, very young children are still developing a relationship with food. They're often more likely to listen to their body's cues, so respect when your child does not seem hungry., You want your child to develop for a variety of flavors. However, it's not uncommon for a child to make a face or refuse new foods. Have patience when this occurs. Remember, your baby is probably wary of the food because of how it looks or smells. If you can coax them to give the food a chance, they may like it.Keep trying with new foods, especially healthy ones that are important for a baby's diet. Do not stop feeding your baby something like spinach simply because they seem to dislike it.
It can take up to 15 tries for a baby to accept a new food, so have patience. Keep introducing the new food at meal times and encouraging your child to eat a little bit more each time.

, If you continue to struggle with getting your child to eat, talk to a doctor. It's important your baby make a healthy transition into solid foods. If your child is refusing food long term, this could indicate a medical problem that you need to address.

Correct changes in the taste of breast milk.,
Give vitamin rich foods to a baby who grazes.,
Change your feeding practices to address gas.,
Talk to a doctor if a food causes rashes.",How to Fix Common Baby Feeding Problems3," If your child suddenly starts refusing breast milk, think about whether you've made any changes to your lifestyle recently. This can affect the taste of breast milk. You may have to adjust your diet or habits to get your child to take breast milk again.Medications, new foods, or changes to your level of physical activity can all affect the taste of breast milk. Lotions and creams applied near the breasts can also affect the taste of breast milk.
If your child is not taking breast milk, try cutting back on any new foods or habits and avoiding lotions and creams. If medication is the culprit, talk to your doctor about switching or lowering your dosage.

, Some babies prefer to snack all day instead of eating one single meal. It is often easier to let a baby eat when they want instead of forcing meal times. However, if your baby does not eat regular meals, break up nutrient-rich meals into small chunks instead of just feeding your baby snacks. Take what you would normally prepare for breakfast, for example, and feed it to your baby throughout the morning in small portions.For example, if you normally give your baby a serving of fruits, vegetables, and carbs in the morning, try breaking this up. Early in the morning, offer your baby fruit. Later, feed them vegetables. Once it's almost afternoon, offer the carbs.

, If your baby is very gassy, diet or eating habits may be to blame. Try adjusting your baby's diet and see if this improves gas. This may be particularly important if your baby gets fussy or uncomfortable in response to gas.Try opting for smaller, more frequent meals instead of three big meals a day. This allows more time for digestion, reducing gas. You might also try burping the baby more frequently.
Make sure that your baby's head is above their stomach when feeding them. If you are breastfeeding in a cradle position, this means that the head should be higher than the rest of their body.
If the baby is fed with a bottle, tilt the bottle when adding milk or formula, and fill it completely to prevent air from being trapped in the bottle. If using powdered formula, give it a few minutes to settle after you shake it., Rashes around the bottom, similar to diaper rash, and around the mouth can indicate a food allergy. Allergies may also be accompanied by vomiting, wheezing, a running nose, and watery eyes. A pediatrician should evaluate your baby is you suspect a food allergy. You want to make sure you properly identify an allergen to keep your baby safe."

Be patient with your baby.",How to Choose the Best Cereal for Your Baby," There are a wide variety of opinions on what foods babies should start with and when, and some of them are far more scientifically-grounded than others. You and your baby’s physician are most familiar with your unique little human being and should work in concert to plot his transition to solid foods.


Most pediatric organizations now say that babies should be breastfed exclusively — or if necessary, breastfed with formula supplementation — for the first six months.This has less to do with a baby’s readiness for solid foods and more to do with his nutritional needs. Seek your doctor’s advice on the best time to start the transition with your infant.
Many experts think that waiting to start solids until 6 months of age may reduce a child's risk of developing allergies and even eczema.
Regardless of when you start solid foods, your child’s doctor will almost certainly advise you to continue feeding the baby breastmilk until at least twelve months of age.In consultation with the doctor, consider the following steps in this section when determining your baby’s readiness to begin solid foods such as infant cereal.;
, Before he can safely advance on to cereal, he needs to be able to hold his head upright during feedings. This is an important safety measure and is crucial in preventing choking.In almost all cases, feeding your baby breastmilk (along with formula, if necessary) exclusively is perfectly fine beyond six months of age. This may be the best choice if he cannot yet adequately control his head for safe feeding. Be patient, be safe., It is okay if your little one cannot sit upright without assistance, and the use of a supportive seat is perfectly acceptable. The important factor is if the baby can maintain the upright position he is placed in.If baby slouches down in the seat, flops his head and body to one side or just cannot maintain a sitting position, he is at an increased risk of choking on solid foods.
Use your best judgment and position him so that he remains as vertical as possible during feeding.

, Before your baby is ready to move on to solid foods, you may notice that his tongue has the natural ability to automatically push food right out of his mouth rather than swallow.If this happens when you introduce cereal, wait a few days and try offering cereal again.

, If your baby has roughly doubled his birth weight (and is at least 13 pounds) by the time he is close to six months old, it is a good indicator that he is ready to begin solid foods.As always, however, consult with your child’s pediatrician.

, Adding cereals to your baby’s diet is a process of trial and error, not only in the feeding process (get ready for a lot of messes!) but in determining how your baby reacts to certain new foods. Starting with single-grain cereals before moving on to multi-grain varieties allows you to better monitor your baby’s reactions and identify potential allergens.


Rice cereal is the common first choice, largely out of tradition but also because it is considered low-allergy, easily digested, and easy to mix and eat.There is, however, no medical evidence that rice need be the first cereal choice; many in fact prefer oats, which are also easily digestible and generally low-allergy as well.There is some controversy over whether or not the gluten content in wheat-based cereals — or barley cereal, for instance — help facilitate the development of wheat allergies and/or celiac disease, or if this actually decreases the likelihood. Recent studies have found that introducing wheat before your baby is six months old may reduce the risk of her developing a wheat allergy.Talk to your baby’s doctor, especially if she is under six months.

, Once you have determined which grain variety to begin with, feed with it exclusively for two to three days before moving on to the next grain. Alternatively, you can add the second grain to the first, and so on.Keep a close eye out for signs of allergies as you introduce each new grain. Rashes, hives, digestive problems like vomiting or diarrhea, and breathing problems can all be signs of a food allergy. Call your child’s doctor right away if you suspect a food allergy, or take him to the emergency room if symptoms seem severe (or if there is any evidence of breathing difficulty)., Although there is some debate on the topic, most experts seem to agree that babies over six months of age, especially those who are breastfed exclusively, benefit from iron supplementation. Iron deficiency in small children has been indicated in developmental delays, and breast milk is limited in iron content (although formula is fortified).Talk to your baby’s doctor about her iron needs, especially if you are breastfeeding exclusively at six months. Should iron supplementation be advised, commercial infant cereals are usually an excellent choice because they are almost always fortified with iron. Check nutritional labels for iron content.
There are other alternatives for iron supplementation, including the introduction of pureed meats to the diet., Much about what you decide to feed your baby has less to do with scientific proof and more to do with your preferences as a parent. When evidence is inconclusive, contradictory, or just not available, you will have to trust your beliefs and instincts. Some of the decisions you will have to make include:Whether or not to avoid genetically-modified crops. There is no reliable evidence that GM crops have any negative health impacts, but some parents want to avoid them for various reasons. Most baby cereals, so long as they don’t contain corn products, won’t have GM ingredients regardless. To be certain, you can select 100% organic products, which by USDA rules cannot have any GM ingredients.
Whether to limit or avoid rice cereal due to its arsenic content. Because of how rice is grown, all forms of it tend to have higher concentrations of arsenic, which in excess can cause skin and vascular problems in children. It is possible that only one or two servings of rice cereal per day could reach the FDA recommended limit for infants, although there is no official recommendation that parents should limit or avoid serving it.
Whether to select whole or refined grains. While whole grains generally provide better nutritional content, refined grain cereals tend to facilitate the absorption of the fortified iron in the product. Both refined or whole grain cereals are acceptable options for babies, but you may want to consider the latter unless your baby has an iron deficiency. Talk to your pediatrician.
Whether to skip cereal as the first solid food. There is no evidence that cereal needs to be the first food group to be introduced, and many parents opt to move right on to ground, mashed, or pureed fruits, vegetables, and meats. Baby cereals are easy to prepare and provide ample nutrients, but babies can thrive without them being the first option, if that is your choice., Commercial baby cereals usually have only a few simple ingredients, along with added nutrients, but if you want more control over the content of your baby’s food, it is easy to make your own baby cereal.


Making rice,oat,, or barley cerealis no more complicated than grinding the uncooked grain (most conveniently in a spice or coffee grinder), cooking it in water for 10 minutes (15-20 for barley), and mixing it with milk or formula.
Please note that homemade cereals are not fortified, so if your baby needs additional iron, for instance, you will have to provide other sources — such as pureed meats.

, Especially when your baby is new to solid foods, be sure that the cereal is prepared more on the loose side rather than thick, closer to soup than porridge.Use breast milk or prepared formula to thin the cereal, whether store-bought or homemade.
Adjust the milk-to-cereal ratio to thicken the food as your baby gets used to eating it.

, Get to know your baby’s needs and implement a feeding schedule that works best for him.Start with just 1-2 teaspoons of cereal mixed with breast milk or formula.
Early in the day works best for some babies, when they are generally the most hungry. Other babies have a difficult time breaking from their routine first thing in the morning, and will do better when cereal is offered in the evening or before bed.
Limit feedings of cereal to once or twice per day when first starting out. As your baby becomes more accustomed to eating solids, the amount of feedings will increase.
Keep providing 24 ounces or more of breast milk or formula per day.

, Remember, eating in this way is a new experience. He may need lots of practice before he can eat cereal. Don’t be discouraged if he does not take to the cereal right away. Wait a day or two and try again.Never force your baby to eat cereal. If he is not ready or willing, wait and try again.

Be sure to cover your back and shoulder with a cloth to avoid getting spit up on your clothes.;
, Place the baby against your chest and shoulder, but high enough up that your shoulder presses slightly into their stomach. This should help coax out any gas in their stomach. Gently rub their back with one hand and hold them with the other.Check to make sure that your baby is not slumped over too far and still able to breathe properly.
This position may work better when they are at least four months old and have more head and neck control.
Put a cloth on your shoulder and back to avoid getting spit up all over your clothes.

, Position your baby so that they are sitting on your lap or your knee facing away from you. Cradle your baby's chin in the palm of one hand and rest the heel of that hand on the baby's chest. With your other hand, pat the baby's back gently until you get a burp.Check the position of your hand. Make sure you are not holding the throat or making it hard for your baby to breathe.
This position may work better once your baby is around four months old and has better head and neck control.
Put a cloth on your baby and in your lap to avoid getting spit up everywhere.

, Put the baby face down on your lap and make sure that they are perpendicular with your body. Support their chin with one hand and gently pat their back with the other.Keep the baby's head higher than the rest of their body so blood does not rush to their head.

, If you baby is fussy, they may also need to pass gas from their bottom. In order to help them with this, lay the baby on their back and slowly flex their knees up to their chest. This will help them work gas out of both ends, but particularly the bottom., If you are not having success with one position, try another. Because of your baby’s anatomy, they may respond better to one method than another. Also, as they grow, the baby’s body will change and you may find that the method you have been using no longer works and you need to try a new one. Luckily, most babies grow out of needing to be burped after 4 to 6 months.

Burp a fussy baby in the night.,
Help relieve the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).",How to Burp a Newborn2," Because babies swallow so much during a feeding, it is important to burp them midway. This will help them expel gas that has built up in their esophagus. It will also help them eat better and keep them from getting fussy later. However, if your baby seems comfortable and happy, keep nursing.For bottle feedings, burp the baby every 2 to 3 oz. (60 to 90 mL).
Burp breastfed babies every time you switch the baby from one breast to another.
In general, try burping your baby every 15 to 20 minutes., If your baby starts to cry or refuses to eat, a burp might be required. Regularly burping your baby during feedings should prevent fussiness, but each baby eats at their own pace and you might have to wait for your baby to let you know that they need some relief.If your baby cries when your interrupt their feeding, you should allow them to keep nursing. Crying babies ingest air, which can make them more uncomfortable., Most babies will need a little pat at the end of a feeding. They have usually ingested about 6 oz (180 mL) of breastmilk or formula, as well as a lot of air. You should burp your baby after a meal even if they do not seem fussy. This will help them release any gas that may build up later.If your baby has not burped for four minutes after feeding, you may need to burp them.
Your baby should no longer need burping once they are 4 to 6 months old.

, If your baby is fussy during the night, but uninterested in eating, they may be a gassy. Picking them up and helping them burp might make them feel better., This disease occurs when a baby’s esophageal sphincter is weak or not working properly, allowing stomach juices to flow back up into their mouths. This can be painful and uncomfortable, causing your baby to be fussy. Regularly burping your baby can help reduce the symptoms of GERD.If your baby suffers from GERD, try burping them whenever they become fussy.
Talk to your doctor if your baby's symptoms are causing them to be uncomfortable, to not want to eat, or to spit up a lot.

Position the baby properly.,
Breastfeed the baby if you can.,
Stop feeding if your baby is fussy.,
Listen to your baby.",How to Burp a Newborn3," One of the keys to preventing babies from ingesting too much air while feeding is to position them so that they get a tight seal when they latch-on. Try to sit the baby upright and feed them at roughly a 45 degree angle or greater. You should also support the weight of the breast and let the baby wrap around you instead of dangling away from the breast. This will help ensure a tight seal and minimize the baby’s intake of air., Infants who are breastfeed have fewer problems with burping. This is due in large part to fact that they can control the flow of milk, which allows them to better coordinate breathing and swallowing. Bottles have a faster milk flow that babies are unable to control, forcing them to swallow air between quick gulps.Try different bottles and nipples if possible. Some bottles have an angled shape or a bag inside to reduce the amount of air that your baby swallows. Different nipples can also reduce air intake. You can also try smaller nipple hole sizes to slow down the milk flow if your baby seems to drink too quickly.

, If you are nursing your child and they get fussy, it may be better to stop the feeding than to continue. Letting your baby fuss and nurse will cause them to ingest more air, which will only make them more uncomfortable.Your baby might also spit up if they get too much air.

, Some babies will need to be burped regardless of what you do. They may be fast feeders and gulp lots of air, or the mother’s milk flow may be too fast for the baby to control. It is therefore important to pay attention to what your baby is doing. If they are fussy, take a break from feeding and give them a burp. However, if they are not fussy, it may be better to continue on with your feeding.If your baby is chronically fussy, they may be suffering from GERD or colic. Be sure to consult with your pediatrician if you believe that your baby suffers from either issue.
Spitting up is normal for most babies, and not usually a cause for concern. However, if you believe that your baby is spitting up more than normal or seems to be more uncomfortable or eating less, be sure to contact your pediatrician.

Be patient.",How to Follow Baby Led Weaning1," Baby led weaning should not be started before the baby is ready. Due to a baby’s development, most infants can start baby led weaning at six months of age. Trying to start baby led weaning earlier, like at four month of age, may pose choking risks.Your baby will demonstrate that they are ready developmentally to make the transition from breast milk to food. It may occur a little later than six months.
You will know your baby is read for solid foods when they can sit upright with assistance, hold their head up, and stop the reflex to push everything out of their mouth with their tongue. They may also show interest in solid food by reaching for it.Your baby also needs to be able to do chewing and swallowing motions, which usually corresponds to less drooling. Your baby will also have doubled in weight from their birth weight by the time they're ready for solids. Your baby's appetite will also grow, meaning they may need to be fed eight to ten times a day on formula.;
, You may want to take an infant CPR course before you start letting your baby transition from liquids to solids. You will learn how to give CPR to your baby in case of any choking. It is better to take a class in person than trying to learn from a book or online.You can find infant CPR courses through local hospitals or pediatrician offices. You can also contact the American Red Cross or American Heart Association. Both organizations offer courses on infant CPR. You can call them or search online for the nearest class near you., Though your baby is in control of their eating, you should still always be present and monitor your baby while they eat. Make sure your baby stays upright, which significantly reduces the risk of choking.Gagging may occur as they move the food around in their mouths. If your baby gags, watch them closely to make sure they have moved the food and they are not choking.
Gagging causes coughing-like or other throaty noises. Choking is silent, and your baby will not be able to breathe and may look scared., In baby led weaning, you want the focus to be on the food, not on the dishes. Dishes can distract babies from eating and instantly become a toy. They may dump the food out of the dish, bang it on the counter, or throw it across the room.Babies will eat with their fingers, not with a fork and spoon.
Just place the food on a clean surface, like the dining room table or the high chair tray.

, Be prepared for baby led weaning to create quite a mess. The high chair should be easily cleaned. Nearby chairs should not have cloth on them, but an easier cleanable surface, like plastic, wood, or vinyl. Remove all cloth tablecloths.You may consider removing the baby’s clothes or putting them in things you don’t mind getting dirty.
Consider placing a cheap plastic shower curtain or tablecloth under your baby’s high chair, especially if you have carpet.

, You may want to give your child a lot of options to choose from, but this may be too much for them. They may get overwhelmed or distracted by too much in front of them. Instead, stick to smaller amounts of foods.For example, don’t place five or six different choices from different food groups on the plate. Instead, go for two. Put out some carrots and mango, or macaroni and cheese and cucumbers.

, Baby led weaning means that the baby controls all aspects of feeding, including putting the food in their mouths. Babies will put the food in their mouth where they need it and then move it around.If they gag, don’t automatically think they’re choking. It’s a natural reaction as they move food around in their mouth.
You may want to put the food in their mouth if they have trouble picking it up or are playing with it more than eating. Instead wait for them to do it.

, Part of the idea behind baby led weaning is that you let your baby learn and discover how to eat. This means they take control of their eating and development. Because of this, you take a hands-off approach. Be patient as you monitor your child during baby led weaning. They are discovering food and learning how to eat.For example, you shouldn’t get upset about the amount the baby is eating, what they like and dislike, if they play with their food, or if they make a mess.

Feed your baby real food.,
Choose the right texture.,
Offer finger foods.,
Avoid choking hazards.,
Include iron-rich foods.,
Continue giving breast milk.,
Take caution with foods that are common allergens.",How to Follow Baby Led Weaning2," One of the principles of baby led weaning is giving your child real food instead of baby food. So, instead of buying jars of baby food, you will be giving your child the same food the rest of your family eats. The food may need to be prepared differently, like steamed so it’s soft and cut into appropriate-sized pieces.For example, you may feed your child steamed carrots, steamed broccoli, toast cut into strips, thin cucumber slices, banana slices, mashed potatoes, spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, or chunks of mango. Soft fish or other meats can be introduced as they progress, and you can also try beans, spinach, hard-boiled or scrambled eggs, zucchini and squash, sweet potatoes, and ripe avocado.Be careful of the amount of salt and sugar in your baby's diet. Avoid buying processed foods that have a lot of sodium; try to make your own food whenever you can. Don't add more salt or sugar to food., One thing you want to do while you are transitioning your child to solid food is offer a variety of textures. You should combine mashed or pureed food with real food. Make sure the mashed or pureed food has soft lumps in it. This helps your baby get food as they learn to chew and swallow, and also helps them get used to different textures.Think about food that is easily chewed, picked up, or squished between their fingers.
Children who are not introduced to different textures early often become picky eaters and refuse to eat certain textures, like lumpy food. Getting your child used to the textures early can establish healthier eating habits from the start.

, When you transition from breastfeeding to solid foods, you will offer your child solid foods. These foods should look like what the rest of the family is eating instead of separate baby food. When you serve your baby food, it must be given in small finger foods that are easy to pick up.Start with pieces of food that are large enough for a baby to grasp, but not large enough to choke on. Think about the size of a chip or an adult finger.

, At first, your child won't be able to eat all foods. This will develop as their motor skills develop. To start with, don’t give your child whole grapes, cherries, or nuts. These foods are too large and won't be chewed, so they pose a choking hazard when swallowed.Avoid round foods, especially if they are hard or large.
Don’t leave hard peelings on fruit, and refrain from giving them hard fruits, like apple, or hard vegetables until they are old enough to chew.
Avoid foods like hot dogs, marshmallows, raw carrots, and similar foods because they can get stuck in their throat.
Stick with foods that small and easily mashed or squished.

, One of the main downsides to baby led weaning is the lack of iron in a baby’s diet. They are not able to eat meat yet, so they may not get enough iron. To help with this, give your baby iron-rich foods. These foods include:Soft fish
Eggs
Beans and legumes
Spinach and other leafy greens
Tender pieces of meat, like roast, small pieces of ground beef, or soft meatballs

, The transition between breast milk and formula to real food may take awhile. Your baby may not start eating the food immediately. They may play with it, learn how to hold it, suck on it, throw it, or practice trying to bite and chew it. This is all normal, but means your baby might not get enough food. Feed them formula and breast milk between meals.You can slowly transition between liquid to solid as your baby starts to eat more food.

, You may not realize if your baby has any food allergies yet. This means you should be careful when you introduce certain foods. Watch your baby closely after giving them new foods for signs like swelling, trouble breathing, rash, or other abnormalities.Common foods that cause allergic reactions are nuts, especially peanuts, wheat, and eggs.

Learn the theory behind baby led weaning.,
Identify the importance of baby led weaning.,
Recognize the dangers of baby led weaning.",How to Follow Baby Led Weaning3," Baby led weaning is a newer approach to feeding your baby used when they transition from breastfeeding into more solid foods. The concept moves away from using a spoon to feed your baby. Once the baby stops breastfeeding, instead of the parents feeding them baby food with a spoon, the child is allowed to feed themselves.Babies are also allowed to have breast milk whenever they want until they have weaned themselves. This generally happens around age one. You may have to wean the baby from breast milk yourself around this age, otherwise your baby may continue breast feeding until they are toddlers.
Babies sit at the table with their families instead of being fed separately.

, Those who support the baby led weaning approach believe that it is better for babies for a number of reason. BLW is supposed to give the child control over their food so they only eat until they are full.When babies breastfeed, they stop eating when they are no longer hungry. However, when they are spoon fed, parents feed them until the parents are satisfied, not until the baby is satisfied. This can cause overfeeding or underfeeding.
Some believe that BLW helps babies develop healthier eating habits and body weights, but the results are currently inconclusive., Though baby led weaning gives babies control over their food and helps them stop when they are no longer hungry, there may be drawbacks. Baby led weaning may lead to inadequate food intake. In addition to not getting the proper amount of calories and energy, the babies may not be getting the proper amount of nutrients because they are allowed to choose their own food. This means they may never eat foods that contain important nutrients.Baby led weaning also may cause a choking hazard.
Baby led weaning may not be appropriate for your child if they have developmental delays or motor skill delays.
Talk to your pediatrician about whether or not baby led weaning if right for your baby.

Select fresh, good-quality produce.,

Don't sweeten your baby's food.,
Avoid exposing your baby to nitrates.,
Feed your baby the same food as the rest of the family.",How to Make Homemade Baby Food," The first step in producing tasty, nutritious food for your baby is to select fresh, good quality produce.


Buy organic if possible, and make sure fruits and vegetables are ripe and blemish-free. Try to use or cook all foods within 2 or 3 days after purchase.
Choose items like apples, pears, peaches and sweet potatoes to try first. Avoid foods that may be stringy or hard for baby to swallow, such as green beans or peas with shells, unless you pass them through a fine strainer after they have been cooked and blended.;
, The next step is to prepare the food for cooking or serving -- this involves cleaning the food and removing any parts that the baby cannot chew or digest -- such as skins, pips, nuts, seeds and fat.


Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly. Peel foods with skins and core items with seeds. Dice vegetables into similar sized cubes so they will cook evenly. In terms of quantity, 2 lbs. (900 g) of clean, diced produce will make around 2 cups (300 g) of homemade baby food.
You can prepare meat and poultry by washing, removing the skin and trimming any fat before cooking. Grains like quinoa and millet should be prepared according to the instructions on the package.

, If you're preparing a ripe fruit -- like a soft pear or avocado -- you can simply mash it up with a fork and serve immediately. Vegetables, meat and grains on the other hand, will need to be cooked first. You have several options when it comes to cooking methods:


Steaming is the best option when it comes to cooking vegetables, as it preserves the most nutrients. Use a steamer basket, or simply place a colander over a boiling saucepan of water. Steam produce until it is tender, usually about 10 to 15 minutes.
Boiling can be used to cook grains, vegetables and certain animal produce. You can boil the food in a broth to add more flavor, if you wish.
Baking is a good option for things like sweet potatoes, cruciferous veggies, meat and poultry. You can add a little flavor to these items by adding herbs and mild spices during baking (don't be afraid to give your baby flavor!)

, This ensures that the ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Also keep in mind that some foods will require the addition of a little liquid in order to achieve the correct consistency -- this liquid could be water, breast milk, formula or a little of the preserved cooking water (if the food was boiled).

, Once the food is thoroughly cooked, set it aside and allow it cool fully. Make sure that meat and poultry products have no traces of pink left, as babies are more susceptible to food poisoning.


Choose a processing method. Small babies will need their food pureed into a creamy texture before eating, whereas older babies can handle chunkier foods. The method you choose to process your baby food will depend on the age of the baby and your own personal preferences.
Some parents choose to invest in fancy all-in-one baby food makers, which can cook, puree, defrost and reheat fruit, vegetables and meat. These are a little on the pricey side, but make making your own baby food a breeze!
Alternatively, you can use your regular kitchen blender, food processor or hand-held blender to process food into a smooth puree. These are fast and easy to use (and eliminate the need to buy another gadget) but may be a pain to assemble, clean and dismantle if you're only working with small quantities of food.
You could also try using a try using a hand-turned food mill or a baby food grinder. Both of these gadget are non-electric and portable. These work well and are relatively inexpensive, but are slower require more physical effort to operate.
Lastly, for very soft produce like ripe bananas, avocados and baked sweet potatoes, you can simply use a good old-fashioned fork to mash the food into the desired consistency.

, Once your homemade baby food is cooked, cooled and pureed, you can serve some of it immediately, then store the rest for later use. It's very important to store homemade baby food correctly, so it doesn't spoil or develop bacteria that will make your baby ill.


Spoon the baby food into food safe glass jars or plastic containers with airtight lids and place in the refrigerator. Label the container with the date the food was made, so you can keep track of freshness and dispose of any foods that are more than 3 days old.
Alternatively, you can spoon the food into covered ice cube trays and freeze. Once the cubes have frozen fully, remove them from the tray and place in a sealable plastic bag. Each cube of baby food will be enough for for one portion, so defrost accordingly.
You can thaw frozen baby food by placing it in the refrigerator overnight, or by setting the container or bag containing the food in a pan of warm water (not over direct heat) for approximately 20 minutes
Frozen pureed fruit and vegetables will keep for 6 to 8 months, while frozen meat and poultry will stay fresh for between one and two months.As making your own baby food can be pretty labor intensive, a good strategy is to make large quantities of baby food on a single day, then freeze it for later use.

, Most traditional baby food is comprised of soft, naturally sweet fruits and vegetables that are easy to prepare.


Such foods include fruit like bananas, pears, blueberries, peaches, apricots, prunes, mangoes and apples and vegetables like sweet potatoes, butternut squash, sweet peppers, avocado, carrots and peas.
These foods are popular as they are easy to prepare and enjoyed by most babies. They are a good place to start when you first introduce your baby to solids, but don't be afraid to branch out and try more adventures foods.
This will help to expand your baby's taste buds and make mealtimes more interesting. Be careful not to overwhelm your baby however -- try introducing one new food at a time and wait at least three days before introducing another. This will help you to easily identify the cause of any allergic reactions., Stewed meats are a great first food for babies -- they are tasty, nutritious and can be enjoyed by the rest of the family as well, which is always a bonus!


Try making a beef stew using some light Chinese or Mexican flavors, such as soy sauce or mild poblano chillies (yes, chillies!). Babies from around the world are commonly introduced to these more intense flavors from a very early age.
Alternatively, you could try cooking a pork shoulder with some citrus juice for a tasty dinner that will keep baby and the rest of the family happy., Traditionally, parents were advised to avoid feeding their baby fish and other potentially allergenic foods until they were at least a year old. Thinking on this subject, however, has recently changed.


A study published in 2008 by the American Academy of Pediatrics stated that it's safe to feed these foods to babies over the age of 6 months, provided they show no signs of allergies (food or otherwise), don't suffer from asthma and have no family history of either.Therefore, you should consider feeding your baby fish like salmon, which is full of healthy fats and is highly nutritious. Try simmering the salmon in a pot of lightly seasoned water until it's fully cooked. Allow it to cool before pureeing (for younger babies), mashing into a bowl of carrots or other vegetables, or simply breaking it up into small chunks (for older babies).

, It's a good idea to start your baby on whole grains such as quinoa and millet as early as possible.


Whole grains introduce your baby to a whole new world of texture and encourages them to use their mouth and tongue in more advanced ways, which can help them with their speech later on.
Whole grains don't need to be bland and boring, you can spice them up by cooking them in chicken or vegetable stock, or by mixing them with soft, flavorsome veggies like onions or butternut squash.

, Like with fish, parents were traditionally were advised to avoid feeding their babies eggs until they were a year old. Nowadays, it's believed that babies can eat eggs from the start, provided they show no signs of allergies or have no family history of allergies.


Eggs are very nutritious, containing high levels of proteins, B vitamins and other important minerals. You can cook them anyway you like -- scrambled, poached, fried or cooked into an omelette.
Just make sure that both the white and yolk are cooked until solid -- undercooked or lightly cooked eggs can cause food poisoning.
Try mashing a hard boiled egg with half an avocado, mixing scrambled egg with some vegetable puree, or adding a chopped fried egg to rice or oatmeal (for older babies)., Many parents become stuck on the notion that baby food needs to be bland and tasteless -- but this is not the case at all! Babies are fully capable of enjoying a wide variety of flavors.


Try adding some rosemary to the pan when you're roasting butternut squash for pureeing, sprinkle some cumin or garlic powder on a cooked chicken breast, add a dash of cinnamon to your baby's oatmeal, or add a little chopped parsley to mashed potatoes.
Babies can also tolerate spicy foods much better than you might think. Of course, you don't want to burn or irritate your babies mouth, but you can certainly think about adding some pureed peppers (mild varieties like Anaheims and poblanos) to things like vegetable purees and meat stews., It may come as a surprise to learn that many babies enjoy the taste of sour foods. You can find out if your baby is one of them by pureeing some pitted sour cherries. You could also try stewed, unsweetened rhubarb or pureed plums, both of which have a tart, refreshing flavor., Solid baby food should be served no hotter than body temperature, to avoid burning the baby's mouth.


You should be especially careful when reheating pre-prepared foods in the microwave, as the microwave can reheat food unevenly, creating hotspots in certain areas.
Therefore, when you remove food from the microwave, give it a good stir to distribute the heat evenly, then leave it to sit for a few minutes until reaches room temperature.

, When feeding your baby, try to measure out exact portions for each meal. This helps to avoid waste, as you won't be able to save any leftovers. This is due to the high chance that your baby's saliva will get into the food as you spoon feed him/her, which makes it much easier for bacteria to grow in the food.

, You should never sweeten your baby's food before feeding. Babies don't require any extra sugar, especially given the high rates of childhood obesity nowadays. You shouldn't use any alternative sweeteners like corn syrup or honey either, as these can cause a potentially fatal form of food poisoning in babies known as botulism.

, Nitrates are chemicals found in water and soil which can cause a certain type of anemia (known as methemoglobinemia) in exposed babies. These nitrates are eliminated from all store-bought baby foods, but can be a problem in homemade versions (especially if you use well water).


As the major source of nitrates in baby foods comes from the use of well water, it's a good idea to have your well tested to ensure that the water contains less than 10ppm of nitrates.
The level of nitrates increases in unfrozen food over time, so use fresh fruits and vegetables within a couple of days of purchase, freeze pre-prepared baby food as soon after cooking as possible and consider using frozen packets of veggies like beets, carrots, green beans, spinach, and squash (instead of fresh versions) as these tend to have the highest level of nitrates., Instead of preparing separate meals for your baby, make life easier for yourself by grinding, mashing or pureeing the same meal that the rest of your family is eating.


This saves you time and effort, but will also help to train your baby to eat the same food as everyone else, which can come in handy as your baby grows up.
Babies can eat most healthy foods that the rest of the family eats, provided they are mashed up or blended to the correct consistency -- stews, soups and casseroles can all be adapted to become baby appropriate.

Select mashable foods.,
Avoid choking hazards.,
Find age-appropriate foods.,
Buy fresh foods whenever possible.",How to Choose Finger Foods for Your Baby1," When you first introduce finger foods to your baby, they will likely not have all their teeth in yet. Subsequently, it is important to select foods that are easily mashed between the gums. Look for produce that can be steamed, as well as soft foods such as grain-based cereals, which can melt in their mouth.Small pieces of produce like carrots or whole peas can be steamed to make them soft and easy for your baby to consume. Remember to wait to serve them until the food is cool to the touch, though, as your baby will be eating these items with their hands.
Cubes of fruit are also a healthy, soft option for introducing finger foods to your child.;
, Some soft foods, such as grapes, may be easy enough for your baby to gum, but they are still too large for your baby to safely ingest early on. Opt for foods that can be cut into small pieces, including soft cheeses, pitted fruits that are ripe and peeled, and even things like meat and pasta.The food should be cut up small enough that it doesn’t pose a serious threat to your baby. Try to make food chunks pea-sized or slightly larger.
Whole foods that pose a choking hazard include nuts, raisins, olives, marshmallows, chips, grapes, and hot dogs., Generally, finger foods come into a baby’s diet at around eight to nine months. Though they can grasp and chew more food now, it is still important to select age-appropriate foods. Consulting with your pediatrician may be especially helpful in determining the right diet for your baby.At eight to nine months, your baby should be eating mostly thick mashes of fruits and vegetables, along with some grain and dairy, as well a few protein-rich foods every day.
While scientific studies frequently produce new information on the subject, it is generally popular wisdom to avoid giving your baby whole eggs in their first year to help avoid developing an allergy. Typically, only yolks are thought to be safe for babies early-on., Pre-packaged foods including instant meals, takeout food, canned soups, canned sauces, and snacks like chips and crackers are often high in sodium and sugar. Your baby's kidneys cannot handle high levels of sodium, so try to select fresh foods or preservative-free foods whenever possible.If you do have to rely on packaged food for certain things, look at the sodium content. Babies under 12 months should have less than 1,000 mg of salt a day, while children under three should have no more than 2,000 mg.Find packaged foods that are specifically meant for babies and toddlers, or look for low-sodium packaged goods when you must.
Opt to use herbs and spices to help flavor your baby’s food instead of relying on salt.

"
"
Try tiny portions.,
Disguise the food as something your child likes.,
Allow your baby to smell the food.,
Offer your baby options.,
Eat at the same time as your baby.",How to Feed a Baby Who Won't Eat1," If you baby won’t eat her food, try feeding it to her in smaller portions. This may be especially helpful if you are trying a new food.When you are trying to get your baby to eat new foods, give her a small taste from your hand or spoon.
You may also try to feed your baby small portions of familiar foods if she is refusing to eat.;
, Sometimes, your child may not want to eat an unfamiliar food. A way you might get her to eat it is to make the new food she’s resisting look like a food she enjoys.For example, if your child really likes pureed vegetables, give her a new vegetable in the same form. You can also try foods of the same color.
Try changing the texture of the food she eats. When switching from baby food, try mashing the food or putting it in a blender if she won’t eat it in whole pieces.Just make sure to increase the lumpiness of your baby's food slowly, such as by mixing a bit of lumpy food in with your baby's pureed food.

, When your baby is refusing to eat, try letting her smell the food. This allows her to become familiar with the smell and decide if it is appealing or not.This might mean holding a chunk of food or the spoon to her nose.

, If your baby is struggling to eat, then try different foods. Give your baby options in case she will eat one thing and not another.If your baby is being spoon fed and doesn't like one baby food, try a different flavor.
If your baby feeds herself, set out multiple foods so she can touch, smell, and taste them and decide what she wants.

, Your baby may benefit from eating with you. As babies develop, they like to imitate what they see. Watching you eat may encourage her to eat.Make sure your baby sees you eating. You can even demonstrate eating to your baby to help her want to eat.
Eat some of your baby’s food. If your baby sees you eat the food, she may be more inclined to eat it.

Get at least 1300 mg of calcium a day to make your baby’s bones strong.,
Go for walks in the sun to make sure you are getting around 0.10 mg of Vitamin D each day.,
Take iron supplements so that you are consuming 10 mg of iron a day.,
Make sure you’re roughly 500 mcg of folic acid (vitamin B9) daily.,
Consume 2000 mcg of vitamin B12 every day.,
Increase your vitamin C intake to roughly 40 mg a day.,
Eat foods that are rich in iodine to keep your iodine levels at around 250 micrograms a day.",How to Breastfeed on a Vegan Diet1," As a vegan mother who is breastfeeding, you need to ensure you're getting enough calcium in your diet. Calcium is one of the most essential nutrients to get while breastfeeding as it will help your baby to grow up with strong bones. You can take a calcium supplement or eat calcium-rich foods like:


Dark green leafy veggies like kale, spinach, and bok choy.
Calcium-fortified soy milk.
Tofu made with calcium sulfate.;
, Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Unless you live in a very cloudy area, you are most likely getting enough vitamin D simply by spending time in the sun.Going for walks in the early morning hours is the perfect way to get your daily intake of vitamin D.

, Iron has many important functions: it helps build blood cells, transports other nutrients to vital organs after metabolism and helps your baby to grow at a regular rate. Good sources of iron include:


Pumpkin seeds, tofu, raisins, whole wheat breads, sunflower seeds and parsley.
Your doctor may also recommend that you take an oral multi-vitamin and multi-mineral supplement, containing 18 mg of iron daily while you breastfeed to prevent anemia. These supplements generally contain ferrous, ferrous sulfate, ferrous citrate, ferric gluconate, or ferric sulfate that are types of elemental iron.

, Folic acid, which is also known as vitamin B9, plays a role in helping the body to make new cells. Often, doctors will recommend that breastfeeding women keep taking their prenatal multivitamins while they are breastfeeding because this is one of the easiest ways to get folic acid every day.Foods that contain folic acid include:


Dark greens like collard greens, spinach, romaine lettuce, and turnip greens.
Asparagus and broccoli.
Citrus fruits like papaya, grapefruits, and oranges.
Beans, peas, and lentils.

, Vitamin B12 plays a large part in the development of your baby’s brain. Because of this, it is important that you get a good amount of this vitamin each day.To get enough vitamin B12, you can take supplements or use yeast or fermented soy beans.
You can also eat B12 fortified cereals, whole-wheat breads, and whole-wheat pasta.

, Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, which means that it is not stored in the body for very long. Water-soluble vitamins can get removed from food when the food is boiled, so it is best to grill or steam vitamin C-rich vegetables (if cooking them at all). You can take a supplement or eat foods like:


Yellow bell peppers.
Guavas.
Dark leafy greens like kale, Swiss chard, and spinach.
Kiwi.
Broccoli.
Strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries.
Citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, and grapefruit.

, Iodine is a nutrient that you need in very small quantities but that is still important. It plays a role in the proper development of your baby’s brain and nervous system. The best way to this is to take an iodine supplement that contains exactly 250 μg.You can also eat foods that contain traces of iodine like:


Sesame seed butter, onions, artichokes, garlic, and vegetables grown in iodine rich soil, to increase your iodine intake.

"
Create variety in your baby’s diet.,
Look for iron-rich foods.,
Buy full-fat dairy products.",How to Choose Finger Foods for Your Baby2," Your baby needs the same nutrients you do, just on a different scale. When introducing finger foods, think about the types of mashes and baby foods you will continue to use in your child’s diet, then use finger foods to help fill in some of the nutritional voids.If, for example, you plan to regularly feed your baby vegetable mashes such as peas and carrots and sweet potatoes, you may want to consider introducing protein-rich finger foods such as small meat or tofu cubes.
Generally speaking, babies seven to twelve months old should get around 95 grams of carbs, 11 grams of protein, 30 grams of fat, and a variety of micronutrients such as vitamins and iron a day.Remember to check labels for nutritional content. Pay special attention to things like sugar, which is a form of carbohydrate and should be factored into your child's overall carb intake.

, Your baby needs an iron-rich diet from six to twelve months, so look for finger foods that are naturally rich in iron, or otherwise iron-fortified. Iron-fortified infant cereals are often a popular choice for finger foods, as they combine a single grain such as wheat or barley with added iron.Meats rich in iron that are safe to offer to your child include turkey, beef, chicken, lamb, fish, and pork. High-iron meat alternatives that can easily be cut up and ingested include chickpeas, lentils, beans, eggs, and cooked tofu., Cheeses are a great option for finger foods, but buying reduced-fat or low-fat cheese for your child is not beneficial. Babies are constantly growing and have very different nutritional needs than adults. Opt for whole milk cheeses instead of reduced fat to make sure your baby is getting the proper nutrients.Check the packaging to make sure the cheese is not reduced fat, low fat, or part skim. Unless otherwise stated, most cheeses are typically made from full-fat dairy products."
"
Look for indicators that your baby is ready to self-feed.,
Start with single ingredient foods.,
Include your baby in meal time.,
Keep portions in control.",How to Choose Finger Foods for Your Baby3," Most babies have developed the fine motor skills necessary to self-feed by around eight or nine months. Still, it is important to make sure your child is ready to get food into their mouth. To see if your baby is ready to self-feed, look for signs like:Grasping and raising spoons to their mouth, though the spoon may not go in the mouth
Grabbing items between their thumb and forefinger
Holding their head upright without assistance
Being able to put things in their mouth on their own
Holding a cup with a lid without help

, Introduce single ingredient foods to your baby first, and introduce them one at a time. Wait three to five days between introducing a food and feeding it to a child for the second time. This allows you to monitor for allergic reactions. Even minor allergic reactions should be seen by a doctor. Signs of allergic reactions may include:Swelling of face, lips, or tongue
Tingling
Itching
Burning
Hives
Chronic eczema
Ongoing vomiting or diarrhea
Coughing or wheezing

, As you start your child on finger foods, start including them in your family mealtimes rather than setting aside a special time to feed your baby. This will allow them to mimic you with their finger foods, and help make the transition toward full solid meals.It is alright to have some time set aside to breastfeed or formula feed your baby, but try to encourage them to eat solid foods during family meals.

, Healthy eating habits start early, so while your child may have a healthy appetite, it's your job to make sure they get reasonable portions that are neither too large nor to small. At any given meal, your baby should be eating around four ounces of food.


This is the equivalent of a small jar of strained baby food.If you notice your child is not eating, or if they have an abnormally large appetite, contact your doctor immediately.

Let your baby feed herself.,
Feed your baby on your lap.,
Make feeding time enjoyable.,
Eliminate distractions.",How to Feed a Baby Who Won't Eat2," Babies may refuse to eat from a spoon. They may turn away, refuse to open their mouths, or even knock the spoon out of your hand. If this happens, your baby may not want to be fed anymore.Babies are usually ready to feed themselves at around eight to nine months old.


When this occurs, let your baby try to eat by herself. Try small finger foods and letting your baby eat her normal meal with her hands.
Good finger foods to start with are small, soft pieces of peeled fruit. However, avoid foods that are choking hazards for babies, such as peanuts, hard vegetables or fruit, large pieces of food like fruit, meat or hot dogs, or candy.

, You can try to feed your baby on your lap if she refuses to eat. By placing her on your lap, it might make her feel safe because she is close to you.Offer food slowly and calmly to your baby, trying to make her feel comfortable with eating.

, If you are anxious or upset, your baby may feel the same. Instead, make mealtimes fun for your baby. You can do this by singing to her or pretending the spoon is an airplane.You may also want to talk to your baby in happy, light tones.
Make sure you smile and laugh a lot. This will help evoke a similar reaction in your baby.

, When you feed your baby, make sure that is all you two are doing. Make sure all toys or devices that make noise, move, or may distract your baby are not where you are trying to feed her.You may also consider turning off the television or the radio when you’re feeding your baby.
If your baby is having a lot of trouble eating, consider asking other members of the house to stay out of the room until she finishes eating so she doesn’t get distracted

Determine if you are feeding your baby the proper foods.,
Keep your baby hydrated.,
Refrain from forcing your child to eat.,
Avoid punishing your child for playing with her food.,
Avoid rushing your child.,
Refrain from introducing too many new foods.,
Take your baby to a specialist.",How to Feed a Baby Who Won't Eat3," Sometimes, parents may give their babies solid foods before they are ready for them. If you are trying to give your baby solid food but she won’t eat it, this may be your problem.Most babies under six months old are not ready for solid foods. Wait until your baby is ready to start switching to solid foods.
Make sure to start with the right type and amount of food. Check with your pediatrician for advice on how to start giving new foods to your baby.

, If your baby refuses to eat, make sure she gets enough to drink. Not eating may make her dehydrated. Though food is important, keeping her hydrated is essential.This might be the case if your baby is not eating due to sickness.
Try water or diluted juices, but do not give diluted juice too soon before a feeding, or your baby may not want to eat. You may also try soups, frozen-juice desserts, or juicy fruits.

, If your baby doesn’t want to eat, she might turn her head or refuse to open her mouth. This is pretty common and can be normal. If your baby refuses to eat, don’t force her. Instead, come back later and try again.Forcing your child to eat may make her want to eat even less than before or turn her off from a certain food.If your baby continually refuses to eat, there might be a more serious problem. If the problem persists, take your baby to see the pediatrician.

, Sometimes your child throws food on the floor and none of it ever gets into her mouth. Babies go through independent phases where they want to feed themselves and have control over their food, and when they are beginning them, they might start by throwing food.Babies may also learn about new foods by squishing or smelling them.

, Your baby may be reluctant to eat if you try to rush her. Rushing or forcing her to eat may cause her to get cranky or agitated. Instead, take your time feeding her.Wait for your baby to open her mouth when you hold the spoon up to her mouth.
If she refuses to eat, try again later. Sometimes, babies will eat very little at one meal.

, When you are trying to get your baby to eat new foods, like solids or an expanded menu, do this slowly. Try introducing one food at a time. If you try to introduce too many foods to your child at one time, it may overwhelm your baby.Give your baby one new food each day.
If your baby doesn’t eat a new food, wait a few days. Introduce the food again. Keep at it and eventually your baby will eat it.

, If you baby consistently refuses to eat, you should take her to the pediatrician. Your pediatrician can do an exam and determine if it is a phase or something more serious.If there is nothing wrong with her medically, your doctor may refer you to a feeding specialist.

Try to eat around 100 grams of starchy carbohydrates a day.,
Eat carbs that are high in fiber.,
Eat foods that are rich in protein so that you get roughly 56 grams of protein every day.,
Combine different plants to get complete proteins.",How to Breastfeed on a Vegan Diet2," Carbohydrates (aka carbs or starchy foods) should make about a third of your diet while you are breastfeeding. Starchy foods give your body energy that helps to keep both you and your baby healthy. Carbs also help your baby develop a good metabolism that will help her/him grow.Carbs that are vegan-friendly include:


Whole-wheat bread.
Cereals like corn or bran flakes.
Brown rice.
Rolled oats.
Potatoes.
Whole barley.

, While the previous step talked about carbs in general, you should make sure that you are getting specific carbs that boost your fiber intake. Fiber helps to keep your digestive system operating smoothly.High fiber carbs include:


Potatoes without the skin.
Bran flakes.
Whole-wheat pasta.
Pearled barley.
Oatmeal.

, A vegan diet is sometimes low in complete proteins, as animal products such as meat, poultry, eggs, and fish are the richest protein sources but are banned from a vegan diet. Complete proteins are protein sources that contain all the 9 types of amino acids. While most foods that have all nine amino acids are meat products, beans are also an excellent source of all nine amino acids.You do not necessarily need to get all of your amino acids at once.. Vegan foods that are high in protein include:


Beans such as Lentils, cannellini or white beans, soya beans and soy products, black eye peas, kidney beans, mung beans, lima beans, and black beans.
Whole grains such as millet, amaranth, oats, quinoa, and barley.
Seeds such as chia, hemp, sunflower, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, and flaxseeds.
Nuts such as almonds, walnuts, pine nuts and Brazil nuts.

, If you are concerned that you are not getting all nine essential amino acids because you don’t eat meat, you can try combinations of protein-rich foods. Listed below are several different combinations of food that will give you all nine amino acids in one serving:


Combine soy beans and rice.
Corn and any type of bean.
364 grams of pinto beans and 12 grams of Brazil nuts.
1-1/2 cups of tofu or lentils and 3-1/2 cups of soy milk add 25 grams of protein to your diet.

Gather essential breastfeeding supplies.,
Gather optional supplies if you want.,
Start by feeding one at a time.,
Latch the babies properly.,
Try different nursing positions.,
Know when the babies are full.,
Burp them after each feeding.,
Keep track of feedings.,
Get the babies on the same nursing schedule.",How to Feed Twins1," Before your twins arrive, it is necessary to gather the things you need in order to prevent stress and chaos. When newborns are hungry, they tend to cry, and if you don’t have the proper supplies, you can get upset and stressed. While breastfeeding really only requires the breast itself, many supplies make the process easier, especially with twins.


Gather burp cloths, which help catch and clean up spit up.
Prepare snacks and a water bottle to help you stay hydrated and well fed. You may feel very thirsty and hungry after each feeding.
Get a comfortable chair or spot on the couch reserved for nursing. Plush gliding rockers are nice, as are recliners and plush easy chairs.;
, You may benefit from a breast pump, a piece of equipment that the Affordable Care Act requires to be furnished free of cost by most insurance companies.You may also need bottles, nipples, a nursing pillow, and nursing clothing to make yourself more comfortable.


Pumping helps prevent engorgement when your milk first comes in, and allows you to be away from the baby if you need to.
Purchase nipples with a variety of flows to grow with your baby for feeding bottled breast milk.
You will also find a nursing pillow designed for twins to be one of the best supports for breastfeeding. These pillows are extremely dense so that you can sit comfortably with a twin on each side.
You can find clothing that helps with nursing, like nursing tank tops and nursing pads, which help you access the breast without having to remove your clothes and prevent you from getting covered in breastmilk.

, Starting off breastfeeding by feeding each baby individually allows you to focus on the needs of each baby. For example, one twin may have trouble latching while the other does not. Individual feedings at this crucial stage help you work out any problems so that you can successfully breastfeed long term.You can transition to simultaneous feedings once each baby seems to be latching properly, if you want. Some mothers like simultaneous feedings because it saves time, but some babies might prefer to be fed individually.
You should alternate which baby you feed first, if possible. Especially early on, the milk at the beginning is really nutrient dense, so you want to make sure that each baby gets enough nutrients.
It's also a good idea to alternate which breast you feed with first.

, Start by getting into position. Get in your comfortable chair and place a pillow under the breast you want to feed on first. Hold the baby comfortably across your arm, with their head in your hand under the breast you are feeding on and feet toward the crook of your arm. Make sure you aim your nipple toward the baby's upper lip to get them to open wide. Then when the nipple is in their mouth, make sure the top and bottom lips are flared out like a fish.Watch the jaw line for movement. This indicates sucking. Also listen for swallowing sounds.

, You might try tandem nursing (feeding at the same time ) positions like double clutch, double football, cradle clutch, and double cradle hold.If you don't want to nurse at the same time, you can use these same positions for a single baby.


For example, double clutch or double football means that you position each baby under an arm, like a football player does with a ball as he is running. Place each so that their faces are at your breast and their legs are toward the back of the chair. Secure their bottoms with your elbows.
A nursing pillow for twins is helpful for this.

, Allow the babies to suckle until they are full. Signs of fullness include relaxed hands, falling asleep, hiccups, being calm, a relaxed body, and unlatching on their own., After each feeding, or between sides if you decide to feed one baby on both breasts in one sitting, you should burp each baby to minimize gas. Set one baby down safely, then cover one shoulder with a burp cloth and hold the other baby against this shoulder so that their face is peeking over. Gently bounce your body and pat their back until you hear a burp or they spit up. Repeat with the other baby.


If you don't burp between sides or directly after a feeding, some babies will spit up more than usual.

, You may want to get an app or make a feeding chart to be posted in your home so that you remember when each baby ate last and which breast they need to be on. The frequency of feedings decreases over time, but at first you should be nursing every two to three hours.

, Even if you aren’t feeding the twins simultaneously, you can at least get them to eat within the same hour. This way, you aren’t feeding them 24 hours a day and you can get some rest.


One way to do this is to watch for hunger cues in one baby and offer the breast to other even if they aren’t showing signs of hunger.

Choose foods that are highly acidic.,
Wash all food before preparing it.,
Steam cook the fruit to preserve more vitamins and minerals.,
Puree the food.,
Alternatively, mash the food.,
Add lemon juice.",How to Can Baby Food1," Think tomatoes, apples, peaches, and other fruits. High levels of acid create an unfriendly environment for bacteria to grow.;
, A thorough scrub under running water can remove much of the dirt and bacteria that might be contaminating the food. You must remove as much as possible in order to create food safe for your baby to consume.

, Boiling can reduce the nutritional content of many foods.

, Blend the cooked fruit with a little liquid in a blender or food processor.

, If your baby is a little older, he or she may be able to handle chunky foods, so a pureed recipe is no longer necessary. Use a fork to mash pre-cooked, softened foods into the desired consistency.

, A touch of lemon juice acts as an added preservative, raising the acidic content of the food enough to ward off harmful bacteria. It also acts as a flavor enhancer.

Find support.,
Set breastfeeding goals.,
Get help with chores.,
Take care of your body.,
Consider combined feeding.",How to Feed Twins2," Breastfeeding twins is a big task, but not an impossible one. It is a life transition that, even though it is temporary, is worth gathering support for. Find a local gathering of breastfeeding moms to get encouragement for the days when it is hard to persevere through breastfeeding. Finding other moms who have breastfed twins is also a good idea.


Don’t forget to talk to a lactation consultant if you get discouraged or have a question. You may have met a lactation consultant when you were in the hospital giving birth. You can also talk to other moms in order to find a good one in your area.
Your pediatrician can also provide support and resources for you.

, Setting goals for breastfeeding twins will help you stick to it on days when you feel overwhelmed. For example, you could decide to breastfeed for six months and then switch to formula.


You could also set up a feeding once a week or more where your partner feeds the babies pumped breast milk while you take a break.

, Making the transition to breastfeeding twins can take a few weeks, especially if you have other children. It is wise to get help with your household chores until you have an established breastfeeding routine so that you don’t get overwhelmed.

, In order to continue to produce a good milk supply, and to stay motivated to breastfeed, you must take care of your body. For the first few weeks of your twins’ lives, you are also recovering from giving birth (unless of course you have adopted), so you need to make sure your body heals properly.


Drink a lot of water, eat a balanced diet heavy in lean protein, and rest when your babies sleep.
Eating foods heavy in calcium, vitamin D, iron, and folic acid can help both your milk and your body.
Get as much rest as you can. If necessary, ask loved ones to take care of the babies so that you can get the rest that you need.

, At some point, once breastfeeding is firmly established, you may want to consider something called “combined feeding”—a combination of breastmilk and formula. This can be helpful in giving you more free time or allowing you to go back to work during the day. Babies also tend to start consuming a high volume of milk as their sucking reflexes strengthen, so adding formula can give your body a break.Breastmilk is the best nutrition for a newborn baby, and making the decision to breastfeed twins is commendable because of how much time it takes, especially in the beginning.Some twins, especially if they are born prematurely, may need special formulas or supplements in addition to breast feeding. However, most babies can still have at least some breast milk, even if they do need supplements to their diet.

"
"
Gather bottles and formula supplies.,
Mix up bottles of formula.,
Position the babies close together.,
Feed the formula to the twins.,
Feed one baby at a time.,
Burp your babies during and after feeding.,
Teach your babies to hold their own bottles.,
Keep up with the feeding schedule.",How to Feed Twins3," While you are still pregnant or waiting for the twins to arrive, it is a good idea to gather your feeding supplies. This prevents feeling stressed when the babies are crying with hunger. If you are bottle feeding with formula, gather items like bottles, nipples with varying levels of flow, bouncy seats, pillows for support, and formula.


Newborns will drink 1 to 3 ounces per feeding every two to three hours, which adds up to between 16 and 24 bottles in a 24 hours period.By the time they reach 6 months, they usually will be drinking 6 to 8 ounces only four or five times in 24 hours, making that between 8 and 10 bottles a day.
You can find both liquid and powdered formula, though liquid is more expensive., To make a bottle of formula, you should pour the correct amount of water (designated on the formula package) warmed slightly above room temperature into the bottle followed by a scoop of powered formula. This prevents having to warm up a cold bottle and eliminates clumping at the bottom.Make sure that you follow the directions on the formula package exactly.


A mixed up bottle can only be left at room temperature for one hour. Refrigerated formula bottles only last 24 hours.
Make the bottles up the night before, since at the beginning you may be going through up to 16 bottles a day. Read instructions on your formula package to determine if bottles can be left at room temperature or should be placed in the fridge., There are different ways to position twins to make it easier to feed them at the same time. After all, you are going to be feeding them a lot, and being hunched over isn’t good for your back. Try placing them in tandem bouncy seats or on a nursing pillow designed for twins to give you proper support.Set up bouncy seats in an area of your home where it is easy to quickly place the twins and strap them in.
Even though you aren’t breastfeeding, a nursing pillow for twins is very supportive. You can position the twins on the pillow alongside you with a bottle in each mouth, allowing you to hold the bottles in place without wearing out your arms.You can use two firm pillows, or two single-baby nursing pillows, as alternatives.

, In order to get a baby to suck from the bottle, brush the nipple against their lips. This should stimulate them to open their mouths wide. Place the full nipple in their mouth and allow them to suck.Make sure they can breath well. If they are propped up in bouncy seats, make sure their neck aren't tilting to one side.
If you are holding a baby, support their neck with your elbow and hold them as upright as you comfortably can.

, If simultaneous feeding is too hectic, you can try feeding them individually. This can mean having your partner feed one baby while you feed the other. Or it can mean feeding one baby first, and the other right after.Get them on the same schedule so that you are not spending 24 hours a day feeding the twins. Even if you want one twin to eat first, they can still share a meal time.
Try to get them on the same schedule by watching for signs that one is ready to eat. Feed the other one at this time even if they aren’t showing signs of hunger. Cues include rooting, sucking on their hands, and smacking lips., Burping is part of the digestive process whether breast or formula feeding. It is especially necessary for preventing gas and gas-related colic in bottle fed babies because they tend to swallow more air.


Try to burp each baby about halfway through their feed.
Burp one baby at a time. Persevere through crying, which may happen if you have fed the twins at the same time and both are uncomfortable because of a needed burp., Although of course newborns won’t be able to feed themselves, introducing the idea of self-feeding to an infant will give you a break sooner rather than later. Start at the newborn stage by placing their hands on the bottles, and within a few months they should start to understand how to hold it.Make sure they are propped up at small incline when feeding. However, don't prop the bottle up against the baby, leave the baby alone with the bottle, or let the baby sleep with the bottle.

, You can find an app for your smartphone for tracking feeding. Open and tap the app when you feed each baby so that you don't forget when they ate and which baby should go first next time.


You can also make a chart to hang up in your home and write on this instead.

"
Decide what age to start.,
Get two of everything.,
Have them share meals.,
Sit them next to each other to feed them.,
Deal with food strikes individually.,
Set up an eating routine.",How to Feed Twins4," Between four and six months, most babies show signs of wanting to eat solid food. To get twins started on solid foods, you should pay attention to their attitudes and behaviors. Signs of readiness for solid foods include being able to sit up and a focus on you when you eat.At around 6 months old, your twins may also imitate your chewing motions when you eat, have a general fussiness that indicates remaining hungry after obviously being satisfied with milk, and development of the pincer grasp (being able to pick things up with finger and thumb).

, When you are ready to begin your twins on food, start by gathering supplies and getting two of everything. Feeding them at the same time saves time and also prevents dealing with fussiness while one waits. Because of this, two high chairs is beneficial.


You also need double of bowls, baby spoons, and eventually sippy cups.
Also gather food like single grain baby cereal, fruits and vegetables that can be mashed easily (bananas or avocados), and other single-ingredient baby food.

, Not only is it good to feed them at the same time, but it is ok for them to share food out of the same container. One bowl of cereal and one jar of baby food, for example, can be all the twins need for a good meal when they first start eating., Set the twins up in their high chairs for feeding time so that you can easily reach both mouths in the same sitting. This saves time and concentrates the mess to one area., If one baby doesn’t like a food but the other can’t get enough, don’t get upset and try to force the picky one to eat. Find an alternative and keep looking until you find what the other baby likes to eat. Chances are that the non-picky eater likes it too, and you can cater to the picky one.


Try to vary their diets and introduce new foods on a weekly basis. If your picky eater simply won’t be open to new options, keep supplying the other baby with different flavors. You may end up feeding them two different meals, but at least you are expanding the palate of the baby that is open to it.

, Your twins will start to understand that waiting is a part of their lives as twins, even in infancy. Mealtimes are one of the places you will see this patience forming. Set up a routine for mealtimes so that your babies can more easily adjust to waiting.


For example, start cleaning them in the same way and order each time. Start by using a wet cloth on one baby’s face and hands, then move to the other baby. The second baby may whine, but it is likely they will get accustomed to waiting if you repeat the routine."
"
Look for freezer-safe jars.,
Ladle the pureed or mashed food into the jars.

,
Leave 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of space between the food and the rim of the jar.,
Seal the jar with the right lid.,
Store in the freezer for up to two months.",How to Can Baby Food2," Most glass jars are not safe for freezer use. Glass expands, which may cause chips or cracks to form and contaminate your baby's food. Some canning companies do produce freezer-safe glass and plastic jars, however.

,, Cold temperatures cause food to expand. Leaving extra room inside the jar allows the food to expand without the risk of breaking the jar.

, If using a glass jar, consider using plastic caps instead of two-piece metal canning lids. Plastic lids are more flexible, which means that the glass is less likely to chip or break.

, The temperature should be at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-17 degrees Celsius).

"
"
Select the right jar.,
Ladle the prepared food into each jar.

,
Fill your canner with 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) of hot water.

,
Place filled jars onto the pressure canner's rack using a jar lifter.

,
Fasten the lid of the pressure canner securely.,
Set the canner to a high heat setting and steam for 10 minutes.,
Time the process once the dial or weighted gauge indicates that an appropriate level of pressure has been reached.,
Turn off the heat and allow the canner to depressurize.,
Unfasten the cover and tilt the far side up.,
Remove the jars from the canner.,
Allow the jars to cool for 12 to 24 hours before storing in a cool, dark, and dry cupboard.

",How to Can Baby Food3," Stick with glass jars in pint or half-pint sizes when preparing baby food.

,,,, The lid must be snug and tightly sealed to maintain pressure during the canning process.

, Close any vents to allow the canner to pressurize. This process should take an additional 3 to 5 minutes.

, If you live at an altitude between 0 and 1000 feet, pressure can the food for 20 minutes. If you live at an altitude between 1001 and 6000 feet, give the process 25 minutes.

, Do not force cool the pressure canner by running it under cold water or refrigerating it. Allow the pressure gauge to return to zero at a natural pace.

, Doing this allows the steam to escape away from you.

, Place on a rack lined with dry towels or newspaper and allow them to air dry and cool naturally.

Look for “Stage 1” foods.,
Buy single-ingredient foods.,
Check jars for ingredients and freshness.,
Choose your own Stage 1 foods.,
Cook and puree the food thoroughly.,
Let the baby decide how much to eat.,
Look for “Stage 2” foods.,
Choose a mixture of favorites and new foods.,
Buy for your own Stage 2 meals.,
Mix and match.,
Move to “Stage 3” foods.,
Look for added textures, flavors, and ingredients.,
Do it yourself or use table food.,
Continue to avoid non-nutritious foods.",How to Buy Baby Food," Some manufacturers use different levels for baby foods. Stage 1 is for babies who are just beginning to try soft, solid food. The possibilities are mainly soft cereals or single fruit and vegetable purees which have a lower chance of causing allergic reactions.These foods are usually for babies around 6 or 7 months old.
Your options will include soft rice, barley, or oat cereals, pureed apples, beets, carrots, peas, and others.;
, When your baby first starts on solids, you should give her single-ingredient meals at first while slowly introducing new foods. These foods are easier to digest. Also, if she has an allergic reaction, you will have a better idea what caused it.Start with one food and follow the “four-day wait rule.” In other words, wait about four days between the introduction of new foods.
Say, for example, that you introduced your baby to pureed carrots on Monday. Continue giving her carrots through Thursday and then, on Friday, add a new food like pureed apples.

, If you are buying ready-made food, examine the jars before you buy for sell-by dates and ingredients. Make sure that you are sticking to single ingredients that are fresh.Make sure that any and all seals are intact, that there is no evidence of tampering, and that the expiration date has not passed.
Avoid foods that have preservatives other than Vitamin C, especially salt or nitrates.
Make sure that the food also does not have other additives like sugar.

, More and more parents are choosing to make their own baby foods these days. This has advantages: cost saving, more control over the food, and fewer preservatives. Just be sure to know what to look for.Making your own food can be a big cost-saver. Baby food jars cost about $1 each, and a child can eat about 600 jars in all.Home-made food can cost a fraction of that.
Focus on single fruits and vegetables. Since Stage 1 foods are single-ingredient, you’ll only need to buy one kind of fruit or veggie for each dish. Easy!
Try things like bananas, pears, peas, pumpkin, and squash. Don’t forget grains, as well. You can feed your baby soft cooked rice, oat, and barley cereals.
Again, make sure the ingredients are fresh and avoid preservatives. This means no canned fruit and veggies, as these usually have added salt and sugar.

, While baby food in jars is ready to serve, you’ll need to prepare your ingredients if you’re making your own. Once you’ve purchased your choice of fruit and veggies, cook and puree them until they have a smooth consistency. Food that isn’t mashed enough can be a choking hazard.You’ll need to simmer some fruits or veggies in boiling water for between 15 to 20 minutes. If you want, you can steam, bake, or microwave the foods until they are soft instead. Some fruits (like apples) will need to be peeled, as well.
Place the softened ingredient in a food processor of your choice and puree it thoroughly. For a smoother consistency, add a bit of water, formula, or breast milk.
The same goes for grains. Boil them for about 10-15 minutes, stirring regularly. Add extra water or breast milk to get a smoother consistency.
Fruits which can be easily mashed or cut up with a fork do not need to be cooked. Bananas and peaches do not need to be cooked.
You can also set aside some of the food to freeze in small containers.

, How often and how much should you give your child to begin? At this stage, try to introduce solid food once per day. She might be wary at first, but should soon learn to like the texture and taste. Try a spoonful or two of cereal one day and of sweet potato puree the next.By about 8 to 9 months, your child should be eating about three meals of solid food per day, for a total of 3 to 9 tablespoons per day. This will increase in coming months.
Let her decide when and how much to eat. A hungry baby will let you know by reaching at food, pointing, or showing excitement.On the other hand, a full baby will close her mouth, push food away, or start playing with food.

, Stage 2 foods are thicker purees than those in Stage 1. They also introduce more flavors, mixed together in food combinations. This group can even contain early proteins and “finger foods,” like small pieces of soft vegetables or pasta.Stage 2 food is usually for babies aged 8 to 10 months.
Since they contain more than one ingredient, the flavors and options for Stage 2 are wider.

, At this stage, your baby should still have purees and soft foods. But she can start to eat foods mixed together, with more flavors and textures. Try to mix it up.


For example, you might buy mashed pears and bananas, apples and blueberries, or apples and carrots.
It’s OK to buy fine meat protein, as well, like in pureed apples and chicken or pureed rice and chicken.
Too much of a favorite food might make your child a picky eater, but you should let her enjoy trusted foods reasonably often.
At this stage, you can also start to introduce dairy products. While children shouldn’t be drinking cow’s milk before about one year, feel free to incorporate yoghurt and cheese starting at 8 months and older. Be sure to use the regular or full-fat kinds., Do-it-yourself Stage 2 foods will be like Stage 1 meals, but with some small changes. You can now mix ingredients and also add some spices, proteins, and dairy. You can also leave the food a bit more “chunky.”Buy foods as before, like apples, carrots, mangos, papaya, melon, and others. But, consider adding ingredients that are a little more fibrous and/or acidic, like blueberries and lentils.
Pastas, veggies, and most fruits should still be cooked and mashed at this stage. You should also cook and puree or finely chop protein like egg yolk and meat.
Try small dashes of spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, all-spice, or dried herbs. Continue to avoid salt and sugar, however., During this stage your child will be getting used to a much wider array of foods, and lots of different mixtures. Plan and create some simple but yummy combinations for your baby. Usually, meals with two or maybe three ingredients are fine.Combos of fruit are a great idea: try mashed apples and bananas, blueberry, apple, and pear sauce, or avocado, peaches, and sour cream (if your baby is ready for dairy).
Soft carbohydrates are also still fine. For instance, you might boil some pastina hot cereal in water and then mix in mashed banana. Or, you can prepare oatmeal with added mashed blueberries.
Babies that are 7 to 11 months old start to grab at food. It is usually OK to indulge them, so long as the food is healthy, nutritious, soft, and small enough. You can do this with diced pasta, small pieces of well-cooked fruit and veggies, and pea-sized bits of soft meats., Stage 3 food is for babies who are about 11 to 12 months old and not completely ready to switch to table foods. They contain larger chunks of food to help older babies learn to chew and become familiar with varying textures, easing the transition to full solids.By 8 or 9 months, most babies have developed enough coordination, finger dexterity, and swallowing skills to move to finger foods.
Babies in this age group are also learning to mash and chew their food with gums or first teeth.

, Babies who have reached this point can eat chunkier textures, larger portions, and more foods overall. This includes foods that have “bits” in it, like softened muesli.


Try pre-prepared foods that mix several ingredients, like Beech-Nut Organic’s mango, pineapple, and granola or sweet potato and barley.Earth’s Best has soups, chunky vegetable combos, and also “chunky blends” like peach apricot muesli and spaghetti with cheese., As always, you can also prepare the food on your own for your baby. You’ll still usually need to cook the fruit and vegetables, but you can mix in finger foods as well as chunky purees. Finger foods should be cut into small pieces. Table food – also cut into small pieces – is OK, too.For instance, for breakfast you might make your baby a quarter to half cup of mashed eggs and cereal with some diced fruit.
Lunch could be diced meat or chunky cottage cheese, with a quarter to half cup of diced meat and fruit and veggies for dinner.
Eating the same food as your baby is a easy way to save, as well. Your grocery bill will be smaller if you aren’t cooking two separate meals – yours and the child’s., Keep it healthy. Added sugars or empty calories won’t help your baby grow the way she needs to. Make sure that foods don’t have added sweeteners or salt.Go for lean meats like chicken.
Limit sweets such as cookies, candy, or sweetened fruit drinks like punch. These should be saved for special occasions only.

Gradually increase your baby’s feedings to two to three feedings a day.,
Be patient if your baby gets fussy or refuses the oatmeal mixture.,
Only add oatmeal to your baby’s bottle if it is recommended by your pediatrician.,
Always introduce oatmeal into your baby’s diet gradually.,
Avoid adding honey to your baby’s oatmeal.,
Avoid adding fruits and vegetables to your baby’s oatmeal.,
Don’t put egg or peanut in your baby’s oatmeal.,
If your baby has an allergic reaction, call your pediatrician immediately.",How to Add Oatmeal to Similac Baby Milk," You can make your own oatmeal by pulsing plain oats in a blender or food processor until they are a fine powder.;
, There are many varieties of Similac formula, ranging from soy and organic to powder and pre-mixed, as well as Similac Advance Stage 1, Similac Advance Stage 2, and Similac Go & Grow Stage 3. Your pediatrician can recommend the best type of formula for your baby.Feel free to also try a few different varieties of formula until you find the type that keeps your baby full and happy.

, The formula package should have instructions on how to mix the formula together and will give you the proper ratio of milk to water. Add the appropriate amount of milk and water into the bottle and then shake until combined., Usually, one to two tablespoon of oatmeal is added per four to five tablespoon of milk prepared.


Mix the oatmeal and the milk until they are combined.
You should start with a small amount of oatmeal and gradually work your baby up to eating two tablespoons of oatmeal at every feeding.
The consistency of the mixture should be as smooth as possible, with only slight oatmeal grains throughout.

, This will allow the oatmeal have a nice, thin consistency as it needs to be semi-liquid to make it easier for your baby to swallow.


If you heat the bottle in the microwave, make sure it is microwave safe.
Once heated, shake the bottle thoroughly to be sure the oatmeal is mixed well with the milk.

, These nipples usually work better with a thickened mixture as they prevent clogging. Most babies can drink easily from this type of nipple.


You can use Dr. Brown’s Y-Cut Nipples.You can also cut a “Y shape” into a regular nipple so that the liquid flows easier out of the nipple. Make sure the hole is not too large as this can lead to a choking hazard.The safest option is to ask your pediatrician for a recommendation on the best Y-cut nipple for your baby’s age and size.

, Choking is a major hazard when feeding your baby solids through a bottle.


Feeding using a bottle is suggested for babies who are three to four months of age, as this is the stage where babies can sit by themselves and hold their heads up on their own.
If you are unsure about feeding a bottle with solids to your baby, consult with your pediatrician.

, As your baby gets more comfortable with the added oatmeal and if you don’t see any side effects, you can gradually add it to more of their bottles until they have oatmeal at every feeding.

, In general, babies who are ready for solid foods can hold their own head up, sit with support, and are interested in food and putting things in their mouth.To help with proper digestion, babies should be fed solid foods sitting up on a high chair or sitting on their parents’ lap., Add water and Similac formula to the oatmeal, based on the instructions printed on the oatmeal package.


Usually, one to two tablespoons of oatmeal is added per four to five tablespoon of prepared milk.The type of Similac formula you use will depend on what your baby likes and what your pediatrician recommends.

, If you use the microwave, make sure you stir the mixture well to get rid of any hot pockets.


Never make the mixture too hot to avoid burning injuries for your baby.

, Younger babies have a hard time eating thicker oatmeal compared to older babies, who know how to chew and swallow.


You can gradually thicken the consistency of the oatmeal once your baby becomes comfortable eating it with a spoon from the bowl.

, You can do this by putting a small amount of the mixture on your wrist to make sure it is a comfortable temperature.

, You do not want to cut or hurt your baby’s teeth and gums as you feed them the mixture.


Avoid stainless steel utensils, which can be sharp.
Purchase rubber spoons that have a soft edge and tip.You can also use Gerber Soft Bite Spoons, which are gentle on your baby’s mouth., Once your baby becomes accustomed to eating the oatmeal and formula mixture, you can also increase the amount of mixture you are giving your baby every day.

, Your baby may need time to adjust to the taste of the mixture, though adding oatmeal to formula is one of the best ways to serve oatmeal to your baby.


If your baby refuses the mixture initially, try to feed him again later in the day or at another time of day.

, Babies with reflux have difficulty keeping their food down because their esophagus isn’t fully developed.So, giving your baby thicker formula helps their food to stay down and can be very beneficial for their reflux issues.Reflux is the most commonly accepted reason for adding oatmeal to a young baby’s formula, as giving your baby oatmeal before they are ready can lead to food allergies and a choking hazard.
If you are concerned about your baby’s eating habits, consult your pediatrician for options.

, Begin with one ingredient (oatmeal only) baby food and then have a four day interval before introducing other foods to your baby or combining oatmeal with other ingredients., Honey cannot be given to babies under the 12 months of age as there is bacteria in honey that can contaminate their food.Avoiding honey can also reduce the risk of infant botulism, a muscle weakness.
Some of the signs of infant botulism are suckling, crying, and constipation.

, Your baby could have a serious allergic reaction to certain fruits or vegetables, especially if your baby is very young and you not sure what he is allergic to, as his immune system is not fully developed yet.


The safest thing to do is to avoid adding other food to your baby’s oatmeal to limit the possibility of an allergic reaction.
Some fruits and vegetable also contain high level of pesticides, which can be harmful to your baby, for example berries, potatoes, apples, celery, peaches, etc.

, These foods can cause an allergic reaction in your baby.


If your baby is having an allergic reaction, symptoms like rashes, trouble breathing, low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, and vomiting may occur.
There are eight food groups considered responsible for 90% of all food allergies, including:eggs, milk, peanuts, wheat, soy, tree nuts (for example, walnuts, Brazil nuts, and cashews), fish (like, tuna, salmon, and cod), and shellfish (such as, lobster, shrimp, and crab).

, Sometimes the symptoms of an allergy do not appear right away, as they could appear up to two hours after your baby has eaten the food.


For severe allergic reaction, such as swelling on your baby’s face lips, head, or eye, call emergency services right away. These symptoms can cause your baby’s airways to close, which could be very dangerous.

Clean up.",How to Feed a Baby or Infant Solid Food," It is generally recommended that babies consume only formula or breast milk until about four to six months. Don't press solid food too early, as it has been linked to food allergies and even eating disorders.It can be time for solids if your baby displays the following signs:


Baby is able to sit by his or her self or can sit with some support.
Baby's weight has doubled.
Baby can turn his or her head away from you if you try to do something unpleasant to the face (like wiping a runny nose).
Baby shows interest in others eating.
Baby shows signs of hunger even after 8 oz/236 milliliters (8  fl oz) of milk.
Baby can show signs of fullness by turning away the head or not opening the mouth, perhaps pushing away with hands.


For absolute reassurance if you're feeling uncertain, check with your child's doctor regarding what foods to introduce and when.;
, A high chair is ideal, but in a pinch you can use a car seat. Have the baby sit in your lap only in desperation, because this position is awkward and will leave you messy. Be careful that the seat is set up safely and the baby secured properly.

, Commercial messy-mats are available, but a shower curtain, a painter's drop-cloth, a garbage bag, or chair mat will also work. Or, simply be prepared to sweep and mop the floor after.

, You will usually need one bowl for cereal, and one for a ""side dish"". Generally, choose unbreakable bowls, because babies tend to grab and drop everything. Be sure any dish used is clean and safe.


You may wish to be careful about choosing containers made from #7 plastic due to concerns about its bisphenol A (BPA) content, which is thought to be able to leach into food and drink and may be a form of endocrine disrupter.Wide scale concern was expressed as to this type of plastic container in the late 2000s, although the research done thus far has not convinced major government food safety authorities as to its lack of safety.Since babies' immune systems are developing, many people prefer to err on the side of precaution and many products now voluntarily state that they are BPA-free. Or, you can prefer glass over plastic or simply avoid heating anything edible or drinkable in a plastic container.







, Regular tablespoons or dessert spoons can be hard on little baby gums. Baby spoons have a protective covering. Some are color-changing to indicate unsafe temperature. Either way, this should also be very clean.

, Whether you use paper, or cloth, have some on hand. Babies get messy.

, Babies on solid food need some liquid. Find out if the baby prefers using a sipper cup or a plastic cup (or you can simply make this choice for the baby). Use clean, filtered water, or juice diluted by half.


Do not get the baby too used to juice; keep it to a minimum, as it is sugar-filled and can harm growing teeth.

, Wash your hands before preparing or serving food.

, If you have an older baby, choose an approved ""finger food"" like rice crackers, meat sticks, and the like. This can also be an ""appetizer"" as you are preparing other food., Even experienced babies should have cereal at least for one meal––it's one of the most nutritious solid baby foods available. The cereal should be the central ""entrée"" (main part of the meal).


Experienced babies will usually eat a variety of grains: oatmeal, barley, or rice. Prepare as per directions.
You can add a little bit of baby food for flavor, or pureed fruit or vegetable.
For a first-time feeding, rice cereal, mixed with formula or breast milk, is the typically recommended food.
For the novice, be sure it is very liquid for easy swallowing.
Always check the temperature of any warmed-up food before feeding the baby.

, Experienced babies usually will have some sort of prepared baby food. On commercial baby foods, the jar often will indicate the appropriate age level. If you choose to heat the food, be sure it is a safe temperature.

, Check lids for airtight seal on unopened containers. Check expiration date for commercial foods. Rinse the container if possible. If feeding food from a jar or container, only do so if the food will not be saved. If not, pour a serving into a bowl, cover, and refrigerate the leftovers. Otherwise, the baby's saliva and dirty spoon can introduce bacteria and viruses into reused food. Use all food within 48 hours.

, The bigger, the better. For feeding you may want to have something waterproof to prevent liquids from soaking the clothes under the bib.

, An experienced hungry baby will usually open his or her mouth to indicate where to put the spoon. Take a spoonful of food, and feed baby. Wait until baby has swallowed before offering more food. A baby just starting on solids will eat only about a tablespoon, so don't expect more than a few bites.

, Every 5-10 bites, offer the cup. Bring the cup gently to lips if necessary, and give a sip or two. This is often very messy.

, Curious babies will tend to grab at everything in arm's reach, including the food bowl, spoon, cup, and even you. A baby will also delight in watching things drop (hence why you need either unbreakable utensils or a very soft landing).

, Older babies can often feed themselves. Less experienced babies may hold onto the spoon or cup while you feed them. Encourage them to ""help"" even if it's messy as long as it is not becoming difficult to feed.

, If the baby is turning the head away, whimpering, crying, pushing away the spoon, or throwing food, he or she is probably done. Either remove baby from feeding area, or offer a toy or other distraction (like a clean spoon, or plastic cup or bowl) as you finish the clean-up.

, Many parents will record what was eaten, when, and how much. A log book, calendar, or the like is useful. This is helpful for keeping an eye on possible food allergens, keeping multiple babies organized, and monitoring special dietary needs. However, it can also be just one extra task in an already very busy day of caring for your baby, so it's no biggie if you don't want to or can't find the time for it; not every person enjoys maintaining such minutiae and others simply have good memories and rely on that instead.

, Clean baby with the towels, especially face and hands. Use warm, not hot, water. Prepare dishware and containers for washing. Clean the high chair area with mild detergent and water. Prepare cloth towels, bib, and any soiled clothing for the laundry.

It's important to make sure the temperature isn't too cold, since the baby's clothes will be removed during the massage. Lay the baby on her back on a soft towel or blanket placed on the floor or a safe flat surface. Put on some soft music if you wish.


You can massage your baby with everything removed or just a diaper on in case of an accident. Choose the option that will make your baby more comfortable.
If you want to massage your baby as a way to calm her down before going down for a nap, you might wish to use the baby's nursery as the massage room. That way you can easily put her in her crib if she falls asleep during the massage.;
, If you want to use massage oil, choose olive oil, avocado oil or another edible oil, since the baby’s fingers might end up in her mouth. Don’t use mineral oil or another inedible oil, since these aren't possible to digest and could hurt your baby's stomach.


Don’t use peanut oil, almond oil or other oils produced from foods that are common allergens.
If the oil is cool, rub it between your hands to warm it up before applying it to your baby's body.

, Do not massage a baby using the same force you’d use for an adult. Use your fingers to gently rub your baby’s body, never pushing too hard or kneading. The goal is not to work out knots or do a deep tissue massage, as it would be with an adult; rather, you want to use soft, circular rubbing motions to gently stimulate the baby's skin.


You'll want to massage the baby’s back, tummy, arms, legs, head and neck. Handle all parts of your baby's body with gentle care.
As the baby grows, you can apply a little more pressure. A toddler can handle a slightly firmer massage than an infant.

, The general practice is to massage the skin away from the direction of the heart. This has a calming effect on the body, so it's a good technique to use if you want to help her get to sleep more easily. You can also massage toward the heart instead, but bear in mind this has a stimulating effect. Massage toward the heart when you want your baby to feel more active.


Choose the direction depending on the time of day you massage her. If it's playtime, a stimulating massage might make her feel like having some fun. But massaging this way right before bedtime probably won't have the effect you want.
Massaging away from the heart is a great way to calm down a baby who's feeling fussy.

, This is a good technique to use on your baby's arms and legs. Make a loose circle or C-shape around your baby’s arm or leg with your forefinger and thumb. Use a very gently pulling motion to pull downward toward her foot or hand, as though you were milking a cow. Repeat the motion several times.


Never grip too tightly, and take care not to wrench her limbs.
Continue until you’ve massaged all her limbs.

, Your baby might enjoy the feeling of having her arms and legs ""rolled.""Gently roll your hands over a limb at a time, as though you were rolling out dough. Rock the limb back and forth against the blanket or towel your baby is resting on. Repeat with all four limbs.

, The massage is meant to be relaxing, and this could be irritating to your baby. Help your baby come to associate massage time as a relaxing, calming bonding session. She should know what to expect, and a tickle could be shocking or overstimulating.

, As stated above, massage is an excellent way to help your baby calm down and get ready to go to sleep.Doing it at regularly scheduled times will help her get into a good bedtime routine. Make it part of your nightly ritual following her bath and other routines your family has established. Plan to start about a half hour before her scheduled bedtime.

, Massage can be a great way to connect with your baby and help her feel less agitated any time of day. Babies often cry when they want attention, and massaging your baby lets her know you're present. It has a deeply calming effect, and many parents find it to be an effective tool for quieting a baby during especially fussy times.


Be sure her other needs are met first, so she’s comfortable during the massage. Your baby might be crying because she's hungry, tired, or for another reason. She won't enjoy the massage as much if she hasn't yet had dinner.
Wait 45 minutes after meals. Massaging a baby right after she eats can cause her to get an upset stomach. Babies spit up quite easily, and any sort of massaging motion has the potential to make her lose her last meal. Make sure she has plenty of time to digest her food before you give her a massage.

, Sometimes babies don’t feel like being massaged, and it’s important to stop if she’s exhibiting signs of distress. If she stiffens and cries, let it go for now and try massaging her another time, when she's in the mood to be touched.


If she seems as though she's in pain when you massage her, make sure your technique is gentle enough. If your technique doesn't seem to be the problem, you might want to take her in to see the pediatrician to see why she seems to feel pain during massage.
If she's enjoying the massage, she'll seem relaxed and receptive to your touch.

, Start by massaging for just five minutes. This will give your baby time to get used to the feeling of being massaged, and decide that she likes it. Go a little longer each time until you work up to half an hour or so. This is the optimal amount of time per day to spend massaging your baby.Massage benefits are myriad. Massage helps to stimulate your baby's growth, give her immune system a boost, and help her digestive system stay healthy. It also reduces stress and aids in emotional development.
As well, massaging your baby helps the two of you bond. It's a great way for fathers to bond with their babies.

, Encircle the baby's thigh with your thumb and forefinger. Gently stroke her leg from her thighs down to her feet, then rub her feet with your thumbs. Curl and uncurl her toes. Repeat with the other leg, then gently bend and unbend the knees at the same time.You can start with any part of the baby's body. Many like to start with the legs and feet in order to help the baby transition from play time to calm time more easily. The baby may kick and squirm, having fun as you massage her legs and feet.
Remember to be very gentle; don't pull on her legs or exert too much pressure as you bend her knees. If she straightens her legs in protest, don't force her to bend them.

, This part of the massage has the most profound calming effect. Start by massaging her chest from the center outward, away from the heart, smoothing your hand over her skin as though you were smoothing open the pages of a book. Then, massage her tummy in a clockwise rubbing motion. This mimics the path of digestion. Keep doing this part of the massage until your baby seems calm.


Remember that if you're massaging as part of playtime, you can make your baby feel stimulated by massaging your baby's chest toward the heart, rather than away from it.
Be careful not to tickle your baby's belly as you massage it.

, Use your fingers to make circles on her head. Gently “walk” your fingers across her forehead and cheeks, and draw a smile on her lips.Steer clear of her eyes and nose, since massaging her too close to these areas might make her uncomfortable.

, Gently turn your baby over so she's lying on her stomach. Massage her back by smoothing your hands from the center of her back outward. Don't grip her shoulders and knead as you would an adult's; instead, use circular motions to rub her shoulders and lower back.

, Fold it in half top-to-bottom first. Next, fold it again, this time left-to-right. Make sure that all of your edges align., Measure 22 inches (56 centimeters), then tie the string to a dressmaker's pen or pencil. Use the string like a compass to draw an arc from top corner to bottom corner., Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors for this, and be sure to cut through all layers of fabric. Unfold the fabric when you are done and discard the scraps (or save them for a future project). You should have a circle., Spread your desired quilted backing fabric on the floor. Place the circle you just out on top of the quilted backing fabric and pin it in place. Use a dressmaker's pen or pencil to trace around the circle.You can match your quilted backing to your main fabric. You can also use a contrasting color instead.

, Remove the pins and the main fabric first. Cut the quilted backing along the lines that you drew using a pair of fabric scissors. Discard the scraps., Place the quilted backing fabric circle right side down. The wrong side should be facing you. Place the main fabric circle wrong side down. The right side should be facing you. Pin the circles together along the edges.You are doing this because you won't be turning the fabric inside out. You will be covering the hem with trim instead.

, Use a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. You can co back over the edges with a zigzag stitch when you are done. Alternatively, you can use an over lock stitch if your sewing machine has that option., The trim needs to be wider than your hem, so at least ¼-inch (0.64-centimeters). Great options include double-fold hem tape, lace, and fringe. Choose a color that coordinates nicely with your fabric. Because of the size of your play mat, a wider trim would look better than a thinner one, but the final choice is up to you.

Pin lace and fringe around the edges of your circle. Overlap the stitching by a little bit.Fold double-fold bias tape around the edges. Make sure that the fabric tucks right into the crease of your bias tape. Fold the ends under by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) to conceal any raw edges. Pin it in place.

, Sew as close to the inner edge as you can, about ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter). Use a thread color that matches your trim. Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing so that the stitching doesn't come undone. Be sure to remove the pins as you sew.

If you are using lace or fringe, choose a bobbin color that matches your quilted backing.
If you are using double-fold bias tape, choose a bobbin color that matches your bias tape.

Make a little tower out of soft toys, baby block/bricks, anything that won't be damaged or do harm when the tower falls down.",How to Make Baby Games," Use what you've got. If you are working with a girly toddler, and have a pink tricycle in the garage, that might be the perfect fit.


However, if you are working with an infant who just learned to sit up and you don't have that many play toys in the house, you are going to need to invent a game. You could do simple things, like ""roll the ball to me"" game (warning: this can be an extraordinarily boring game)

Count everything all the time (this is for older babies/toddlers and preschool), try something a little advanced, like ""Let's count the spoons!"".
It does not matter that they have no idea what that means at first, but they learn everything that way.
Start by making groups: a ""one spoon"" group, ""Two spoons!"" in another, a group of ""Three spoons!"", count a cluster of four; okay, 4 is high enough for beginners. Repeat; count cans of food, bottles of spice (let him or her smell of the spices as you count them) do it a few times and think of new wrinkles, again.

Count some toys or a certain color, and say
""One red block, two red blocks, three red blocks,"" etc.

;
, You can fill a plastic egg with beans and cement in well with instant glue and shake it to make a maraca or rattle (but, of course, never leave toys with small parts like beans for them to play with, or they may choke on them). Momentarily place a blanket or you hands over your own face and move it away to play ""Peek-a-Boo!""



Sort by color. You separate the toys, shapes, etc. into little piles of one color. Play with one color for a minute, for example: red and chant ""Red, red, red,..."" Play with another color and sing ""Yellow, yellow,..."", etc. This takes advantage of many infant and toddler toys are made in single, bright colors.

Then when the child has a single color toy in one hand or bangs the toy on a chair or on your leg, then keep saying the color ""Purple, purple,..."" and touching it, or such... If the child has two colors, such as: green in one hand and blue in the other, then touch the blue and say ""Blue!""; then touch the touch the green and say, ""Green!""

Play ""color tag"". Once the child gets the idea or colors, then if the child places a hand on a red automobile, car door and stares at you expectantly say ""R-e-e-e-d!"" or shows you a solid pink wall say, ""Pink,pink,pink,pink!"" and stuff like ""Umhuh Pink! Umhuh Pink!,...""


Make music. Babies love to hear things and make sounds themselves. Even if you're only clapping your hands, humming ""twinkle, twinkle, little star"", or stomping your feet to a simple rhythm, you could get them going, and remember: it's all a game to them!

, If you see them reaching for a blanket, rattle, or teething toy, encourage them to use it. Get it for them and try to make a game out of it by playing along. Sometimes, babies (even though they don't realize they are doing it) like to make the choices too. Don't immediately jump into a game - see what the baby goes for and work with that.


If a baby is trying to reach for something, give it to them, or put the toy nearer to them so they aren't struggling.

, Going into a huge, complicated game will not be fun for a baby. Let's play hide the bunny in the living room rather than Mafia. Also remember to do something that is easy for the baby. It's good to challenge the baby, but not always when your playing, or they may be too challenged and think that playing is too hard and won't want to.

, Whether it's a snack, some tummy time, or taking a nap, when you've hit rock bottom, find an activity that isn't exactly a game. Sometimes, babies like these even better.

, If you make real rules for the game that you need to follow in order to play, the baby will immediately get bored and confused and won't want to play. Babies can't follow the rules because they're only babies, and won't know how. If they change the rules a little, like pass the ball in a different direction, don't worry about it and don't try to fix it.

, Encourage them to keep playing, and if you sense boredom, become more excited. Clap your hands, smile and laugh to let the baby know you are ready to keep playing. Put lots of enthusiasm in it and the baby will have a ball!


If you think the baby is getting antsy, find a new game.

, It's okay if they don't do it right on the first try, or break a rule, or wind up playing a totally different game, because they are just babies and won't know better. Keep playing though! They'll get the hang of it.

, Talk to the baby as you do it. ""Look baby, I am putting all these toys into a neat tidy tower. Oh, I hope my tower won't topple over"". Turn your back. If baby knocks the tower over, play act a bit sad and disappointed, ""Oh, now I have to build it all over again"". If the baby doesn't knock the tower over, 'accidently' do it yourself. Start again, finish the tower, turn your back, off you go again. Many babies seem to find it hilarious to destroy your 'hard work' and will chuckle with delight as they gleefully, repeatedly destroy your tower. You can add an educational element by describing your tower, ""I will put the biggest block on the bottom, add the next biggest block, the red one, next, etc."" It'll get boring for you but many babies love repetition."

, Fold the fabric in half from top to bottom first. Then, fold it in half again from side to side.Do this step for both pieces of fabric.

, Pin some string to the corner where all folds meet. Measure 20 inches (50 centimeters) and tie the string around a dressmaker's pen or pencil. Use the string like a compass to draw an arc from corner to corner.Do this step for both pieces of fabric.

, Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to do this, and be sure to cut through all layers of fabric. Cut the two circles out separately. Do not attempt to cut through both pieces of fabric at once; it will be too thick. Discard the scraps or save them for another project.

Keep your scissors at a slight angle and make smaller cuts. It will take longer, but your circle will be neater in the end., Pin one of your fabric circles to the batting of your choice. Make sure that the right side of the fabric is facing up. Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut around the batting. Do not remove the pins just yet., Make sure that the right side of the fabric circle is facing up, and the edges are aligned. Use a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance., Set your second circle down with the right side facing up. Measure out your desired trim, and pin it around the circle. Make sure that the trim's edges are aligned with the circle's edges, and that the fancy part is facing inwards. It may look weird now, but when you are down sewing, the fancy part will be sticking out., Use a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Be sure to remove the pins as you sew., Place the first circle down on the floor, right side up and batting side down. Place the second circle down on top of it, right side down. Make sure that the edges match up and that the trim is tucked inside. Pin the circles together.

It may look weird at the moment, but the batting will be on the inside once you turn the circle inside out.

, Use a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Leave a 3 to 4-inch (8 to 10-centimeter) gap for turning. If you'd like, you can go over the edges again with a zigzag stitch, but don't go over the gap. Be sure to remove the pins as you sew.If you are using jersey knit fabric, use a ball point needle. This will prevent the needle from pulling on the fabric and breaking the thread., If you'd like a neater finish, cut notches into the hem all the way around the circle every couple of inches/centimeters. This will help reduce buckling and bulk., Focus on the edges of the circle, and try to avoid the fringe. When you reach the gap, tuck the hem inside; secure it with sewing pins if needed. Be sure to use a setting suitable for the type of fabric you are working with., Sew ⅛ inch (0.32 centimeter) from the edge of the circle (where the trim begins). This time, go over the gap that you made. Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing so that the stitching doesn't come undone."

Apply antifungal cream.,
Treat scalp ringworm.,
Make a garlic paste.,
Try coconut oil.",How to Treat Ringworm in Babies2," If your baby has ringworm, your doctor will more than likely suggest an over-the-counter antifungal cream. This will help to kill the fungus causing the rash. Common brands of creams include Lamisil, Micatin, and Lotrimin. You can spread the cream over the rash. Make sure to spread at least one inch beyond the edge of the rash spot.Use the cream twice a day. Make sure to keep using the cream for a week after the rash has cleared up or until your doctor tells you to stop. It usually takes two to three weeks to completely clear up.
Make sure to wear gloves when you apply the cream. This will minimize your chance of catching ringworm or spreading it to other family members.
If you don't wear gloves, wash your hands thoroughly before and after applying the cream — including under the nails.
You may also use antifungal lotions or powders.

, Scalp ringworm can be a lot more difficult to get rid of than ringworm on other parts of the body. If your baby has ringworm on the scalp, your doctor will probably prescribe something stronger than over-the-counter creams. The child will usually be prescribed an oral antifungal, which may be administered for four to eight weeks.The doctor will probably also give you a special shampoo to wash your baby’s hair with to help get rid of the fungus and reduce contagiousness.

, Garlic has antifungal properties that can help treat the fungus responsible for ringworm. You can make a paste with crushed, raw garlic to spread over the rash. Crush two cloves of garlic and mix it with a carrier oil, like almond oil. Spread this paste onto the rash. Let it sit for 10 minutes before washing it off with warm water.You can do this two times a day.
You can also use garlic oil. Add two to three drops of garlic oil to four tablespoons of almond oil. Apply the mixture on the rash. Leave for 10 minutes, and then rinse with warm water. You can do this two times a day.

, If you think your baby may have gotten ringworm from a pet, you should take your pet to the vet. Both dogs and cats may transfer ringworm to a human. You should take your dog or cat to the vet to get him checked out for any ringworm infection, and then treat the pet if he is infected.If your baby got ringworm from an animal, she will not be able to transfer it to another human because it is a different type of ringworm.

, Ringworm is most commonly spread through direct contact with an infected person. This is why it is less common in babies than school children; however, your baby can catch ringworm by interacting with other children with ringworm. He may also catch it by crawling across or touching an infected surface.Your baby may also get ringworm from pets since dogs and cats both carry ringworm fungus.
Ringworm is usually no longer contagious after about 48 hours of treatment.

Try using cornstarch.,
Use oatmeal to soothe your baby’s skin.,
Use cold compresses to treat your baby’s rash.",How to Treat Neck Rashes for Your Baby1," In particular, look for clothes that are made from cotton.

Call your doctor.,
Make an appointment to address sores.,
Make an appointment to discuss ongoing issues.",How to Treat Diarrhea in Newborns1," Call your baby’s healthcare provider if you have questions that you need to have answered or if you are in any way unsure about your baby’s condition.


Newborns are very fragile, and can become quickly dehydrated. If you suspect that your baby is dehydrated, or if he has any of the following symptoms, call the pediatrician immediately:Fever. Call the doctor for any temperature above 100.4 F in babies under two months, or any temperature over 101.5 F in babies over two months.Vomiting. While vomiting and diarrhea commonly occur together during bacterial or viral illnesses, newborns are already at risk of dehydration and that risk increases when both factors are present.
Symptoms of dehydration including dry mouth, less than six wet diapers per day, lethargy, sunken eyes, a sunken fontanelle (soft spot), no tears when crying, or dry skin.
Diarrhea that has lasted for 24 hours or more or if there is blood in either the vomit or stool.
If the baby refuses to eat, is very irritable, or is very sleepy or difficult to wake up.

;
, Have your baby seen by her healthcare provider if her bottom develops open sores that are not helped by any of your attempts to sooth them, or if the irritation does not appear to be getting better.


Sores on the bottom as a result of diarrhea are very common, but open sores can become infected if not treated properly. The pediatrician can prescribe an ointment to sooth the baby's discomfort and prevent infection, as well as helping improve the diarrhea so that the sores do not worsen.

, If you find that your baby has recurrent bouts of diarrhea, even if they are not severe or accompanied by other issues, it is a good idea to schedule an appointment to discuss the issues with the doctor. That way, the doctor can help to pinpoint the underlying cause and prescribe a plan to prevent future issues.


Ongoing issues with diarrhea could signal intestinal problems, food intolerances or allergies (in newborns, this can include sensitivities to foods that mother eats if the baby is breastfed, or an allergy to ingredients in formula).
A pediatrician can also help to ease your mind if you are not sure whether or not your baby has diarrhea. Feel free to save a representative soiled diaper in a large ziplock bag and take it to your next appointment. The pediatrician should be able to tell if the baby is truly struggling with diarrhea.

Know what is normal.,
Do not expect newborn stools to resemble adult stools.,
Recognize diarrhea in newborns.",How to Treat Diarrhea in Newborns2," Newborn stools come in a variety of textures depending on the baby's age and diet, and loose, watery bowels are not always a direct indication that diarrhea is present.


Because every baby's stooling patterns differ slightly, it's important to keep track of your baby's patterns so that you can recognize if something is not normal. Most hospitals will give you a chart to keep track of your baby's feeding, urination, and stools, but if they don't, be sure to keep track in a journal or notebook. Simply write down the date every morning, and list the start and end time of any feeding sessions, the time you change diapers that are wet only, and the time you change diapers that are soiled with feces throughout the day.
In the first days of life, newborn stools are known as meconium, and are sticky, black or green, and similar to tar in consistency. These stools are composed of substances the baby swallowed while in utero, amniotic fluid containing body cells.As the meconium is cleared from the baby's system, it is replaced by the first stools resulting from the baby's diet. A breastfed infant and a formula fed infant will have different bowel patterns, and the stools of the two will be different in appearance.

, While you would be shocked if your stools were mustard yellow or seedy, loose stools like these are normal for newborns.


A breastfed newborn's stools are usually bright yellow and seedy in appearance, similar to dijon-style mustard or yellow colored small curd cottage cheese. All babies' digestive systems differ (depending in part on the mother's diet and the baby's muscle tone), and so some breastfed newborns will pass stools after every nursing session while others may only defecate every few days, or more rarely, even once a week! This is because breastmilk is used very efficiently by the newborn's body, and there isn't much waste to eliminate.A formula-fed newborn's stools are typically tan or yellowish in color and firmer than a breastfed baby's. They are typically the consistency of smooth peanut butter. They are also generally smellier. Formula-fed babies usually stool several times a day to several times a week.

, If you have kept familiarized yourself with your baby's typical stooling patterns, it should be easier to recognize a deviation from the norm. In general, diarrhea in newborns has the following features:


Increased frequency of stools (generally more than one per feeding).Increased amount of liquid or mucus in the stool. Call the pediatrician immediately if there is any blood in the stool.Often a larger volume of stools.

"
"
Note the mother's diet.,
Consider any recent changes to the baby's feeding.,
Consider any other additions the baby's diet.,
Look for signs of illness.,
Know other factors that can cause changes in stools.",How to Treat Diarrhea in Newborns3," While rare, the diet of a nursing mother can affect her breastfed baby enough to cause a temporary bout of diarrhea.


Pay attention to what was eaten by mom in the day before her baby had a bout of diarrhea. If the baby has another bout of diarrhea after her mom has once again consumed that same food, eliminate that food from mom’s diet while she continues to nurse her baby. Wait and see if the condition clears up. Common culprits include dairy, soy, wheat, or peanuts., Know that a change from breastfeeding to formula feeding can lead to the development of diarrhea in newborns. Your baby’s digestive system is still immature and as such is sensitive to the introduction of new foods.


If you have recently introduced a new formula into your baby’s diet and he appears to develop diarrhea shortly after the introduction of that food, it may be that your baby's digestive system is reacting to the sudden change. If this happens, you can make a choice:

Stop feeding your baby formula. Wait until your baby’s digestive system matures a little more before introducing the formula again, and breastfeed in the meantime.
Try to introduce the new formula at a slower pace. Slowly combine more and more formula with less and less breast milk until your baby is able to digest the desired amount of formula.



, While a newborn should not be fed any solid foods before the age of six months,any introduction of new food to your baby’s diet can disrupt the intestinal tract for a short period of time.


Pay close attention to the way that your baby reacts to any new foods and always introduce only one new food at a time for at least three to four days at a time. This may be the only way to determine if your baby is suffering a reaction from the new food.
Be sure to talk to the pediatrician before introducing new foods to your baby's diet, or before introducing any foods but breastmilk or formula before the age of six months.

, Keep a very close eye on your baby and watch for other signs to develop that may indicate illness.


A fever and a runny nose or vomiting usually indicate that the diarrhea is the result of some type of underlying bacterial or viral illness. In a young newborn age two months or younger, you should call the pediatrician immediately about any fever. A fever coupled with diarrhea is particularly dangerous, since a very young baby can dehydrate quickly.
In addition, if other family members also have diarrhea, it is likely caused by an infection, or less likely, food poisoning.

, A change in stool frequency and texture is most likely diarrhea, but other changes indicate other possible causes.


An infant that is on medication, including vitamins or supplements, may have a change in bowel texture or frequency. Antibiotics often cause diarrhea. If diarrhea continues or worsens, you may have to discontinue using that medication and begin another.
You should never give an infant under six months water or juice (they get all the water they need from breastmilk or formula, and too much additional water can dilute their blood and damage their kidneys, resulting in severe complications or even death). However, giving an infant water or juice is also known to cause a change in bowel patterns.
Teething can also cause diarrhea, which is thought to be triggered by the excessive production in saliva during the teething process. While uncommon, newborns can experience early teething resulting in diarrhea.

Change your baby's formula.,
Keep your baby hydrated.,
Monitor your baby closely.,
Understand that your baby’s bottom may become intensely sore and irritated.",How to Treat Diarrhea in Newborns4," Speak with your healthcare provider if your newborn baby is on a diet of formula and develops diarrhea. It may be that your baby just needs to find a formula that works for her.


Often, parents have to try out several different types of formulas before they find the right fit for their baby. While most babies thrive on dairy-based formulas, others must special formulas, including lactose-free and soy-based formulas. In general, babies who have a sensitivity to their formula are also gassy and fussy.For babies who have a weak or undeveloped digestive system or a true milk allergy, there are specific formulas that are developed for sensitive tummies. These include formulas made from broken-down proteins or an elemental formula. Speak with your doctor to get a recommendation. Some require a prescription.
Talk to your pediatrician before changing your baby's formula.

, Whether your baby is formula-fed or breastfed, it is important that you increase the milk that you offer while a baby is sick with diarrhea or vomiting, as both can quickly lead to dehydration in such a small body.


If you normally nurse or offer a bottle every three hours, try offering every two or even every hour. A newborn cannot drink too much formula or breastmilk, especially while sick.
If your baby is vomiting, offer smaller amounts at each feeding, but offer it more frequently.
Do not offer the baby water or water down the formula. This is very dangerous for newborns, as it can dilute the blood and cause kidney failure.To increase hydration, you must increase breastmilk or formula intake only.

, Diarrhea can cause dehydration to occur rather quickly. Any bouts of diarrhea that last for more than 24 hours indicate that your baby needs medical assistance. Any signs of dry diapers for longer than six hours or the absence of tears when your baby cries are clear indications that your baby has become dehydrated. Seek medical assistance promptly.


Discuss with your baby’s healthcare provider the possibility of giving your baby an electrolyte solution as a way to rehydrate her for the time being. These include Pedialyte and Enfalyte as well as other brands. They are especially useful if your baby is vomiting.
Your baby's pediatrician may also suggest a probiotic to help replenish the natural bacteria in her gut.

, It is not uncommon for bouts of diarrhea to leave a baby’s bottom literally raw with open sores. Extra attention is needed to prevent this from happening.


Coat the baby's bottom and genital area with a thick diaper rash cream or petroleum based product like Vaseline or Aquaphor to prevent further irritation.
Keep your baby’s bottom clean and dry. Sometimes, regardless of how often you change your baby’s diaper baby, he will still develop a red, sore bottom. Diarrhea can be harsh on sensitive skin. Promptly remove the diaper and gently cleanse diarrhea from the skin. The less time the skin is exposed to the irritant, the better it is for the skin.
Remove baby's diaper, clean the baby's bottom, and allow your baby to rest on a blanket with no diaper on. Fresh air may help clear up the diaper rash. Avoid excessive wiping of your baby’s bottom. His sensitive skin can become very tender when wiping is increased drastically.
Call your healthcare provider if you notice a rash developing in the genitals, skin folds or thigh areas as this could be a sign of a yeast diaper rash. This is often very red, and may have red bumps spreading out from the red areas. You will need to get prescribed medication to treat a yeast diaper rash.
Refrain from using unnecessary cleansers on your baby’s bottom right now. Try to purchase a cleanser that is specifically designed to sooth sensitive skin. Organic products, even if you don’t usually use them, are worth a try to help alleviate irritation.
Switch to extra soft chemical-free baby wipes for the duration of the diarrhea. You can also try soaking your current wipes in clear water to remove some of the irritating ingredients before wiping your baby’s bottom with them, or using soft squares of flannel fabric from the fabric store soaked in water and a tablespoon of coconut oil. You can also use a clean washcloth with warm water to cleanse the diaper area.

Buy a diaper pail, (or use a five gallon bucket) and place it near the toilet.,
If you decide to use a wet pail, put two inches of water in the bucket and add about a half a cup of borax or baking soda and stir.,
Drop diapers that are only wet directly into the pail.








,
Use a diaper sprayer or spoon to scrape solids into the toilet.,
Collect enough diapers to do a load of laundry.,
Do a cold wash or pre-wash on the diapers to remove most of the loose matter.,
Wash the diapers in a washing machine.,
Line dry the diapers.,
Fold and store the diapers for reuse.",How to Wash Diapers,"






;
,









As you add more diapers, the two inches of liquid you have added will ""wick up"" by capillary action, keeping all the diapers a lot fresher than they would be without the solution. And yet, because you are only using a couple of inches of water, your pail won't get so heavy you can't lift it.

,,









A spoon works better than a flat scraper because the curved surface of the spoon gives you more control. Once you have scraped the diaper, drop it in the bucket. If it was a really messy one, you may have to dip the diaper in the toilet to rinse it or use a diaper sprayer which connects to the back valve of your toilet and works great.
Choose a mismatched spoon for this task so you always know which is the diaper spoon. Most thrift stores have inexpensive, mismatched flatware.

, Depending on how many diapers you have and how often you need to change them, you should wash diapers every day or every other day. Thus having plenty of fresh, clean diapers on hand, and greatly reducing the odor.








, This may be less necessary with a wet pail or pre-soak method.








, Use hot water, and do not add fabric softener. Fabric softener can reduce the absorbency of the diapers. Use 3/4 of a cup of vinegar, instead. It will keep your diapers soft and absorbent.









Depending on your water quality, you may need to experiment with different types of laundry detergent or adding an extra rinse to the end of the wash cycle. Use only about 1/3 of the amount of laundry detergent that you would normally would otherwise the absorbency of the diaper will be reduced. Chose a laundry detergent that is specifically designed for babies. the use of regular detergent over time can be very irritating on a baby's tender skin.

, Sunshine is best, but you can dry them on a rack indoors if weather or living arrangements don't allow outdoor drying.









If you dry them in a machine they tend to wear out faster. Also be aware that many all-in-ones and wraps lose their waterproofing if you machine dry them.
For fast, easy air drying, purchase a hanger for multiple pairs of pants with a lot of bars on it. This way you can fit more than one diaper per hanger. Hang the diapers up on your shower curtain rod with the fan blowing. When dry just hang the pants hanger full of diapers with the babies things, instantly put away.
Line drying also saves money. Clothes dryers take a lot of power to run.

, Fold them the way you will fold them to put them on the baby, so that they will be ready to go.

These materials are comfortable and slightly stretchy, allowing them to adjust to the contours of both you and your baby's body.To make the wrap, you will need 5 yards (4.6 m) of your chosen material (42 inches wide).;
, You will need to have a scissors readily at hand which you can use to cut the required amount of material. Sewing shears are the best for cutting fabric - these have blades that are more than 6 inches (15.2 cm) long and have different shaped handles for your fingers and your thumb.A piece of chalk will also come in handy to mark out the line for cutting.

, The last items you need to make a Moby wrap are a sewing machine and some thread. You could sew the material by hand, but the sewing machine will be faster, make your stitches look neater and help to prevent fraying.

, Before you make your own Moby wrap, go to a baby supply store and examine their stock of Moby wraps. This will give you an idea of the proper size, length, width, stretchiness and texture before you make your own.

, Once you have purchased 5 yards (4.6 m) of an appropriate material, in your favorite color or texture, take it home and spread it out flat on the floor or on another large surface.

, The easiest way to cut the material in a straight line is to fold the material in half, then mark several points along the crease with a piece of chalk.


Open the material out again and carefully cut along the chalk-marked line, using the fabric shears. It will be easier to cut if you ask someone else to hold the material taut as you work.
Once cut, you should have two strips of material, each approximately 5 yards (4.6 m) long and 20 inches (50.8 cm) wide. Each of these long strips can be used to make a Moby wrap.
Alternatively, you can ask one of the employees at the fabric supply store to cut the material in half for you before you bring it home.

, Once you have cut your fabric in half, your Moby wrap in half, it is ready to use. However, you can make the wrap look much neater and prevent the edges from fraying by sewing the edges.


Use pins to fold over the rough edges to the desired width, then iron these folded edges to make them easier to sew.
Place the thread in the sewing machine and use an overlock or zigzag stitch to hem the edges.

, Brand-name Moby wraps have a tag in the center of the material so you can easily find the middle. This is helpful when you are tying the wrap around your body.


If you like, you can emulate this tag by sewing a small square of fabric (in a contrasting pattern/color and fabric) onto the center of the fabric, along the top edge.
Using a patch of material made from a different fabric will help you to easily find the tag by feel alone.

, Take the Moby wrap and gather the material together. Wrap the material around your body from front to back, so the tag is at the center of your waist, just above your belly button.


If you want a cleaner look, fold the Moby wrap in half lengthwise before you begin wrapping. Make sure to keep the seams together.

, Cross the two ends of the material behind your back to make an x. Bring the ends over your shoulders (like straps), keeping the material as flat as possible for optimal comfort.

, Tuck the two ends of the wrap underneath the piece of fabric around your waist (directly behind the tag), from top to bottom. Arrange the material so it fits snugly around your body.

, Cross the ends of the wrap a second time, making an x shape in front of your stomach. Bring the ends around to your back then continue to wrap them all the way around the body, before tying the two ends together in front of your stomach.

, Once the Moby wrap is secured around your body, you can place your baby into it. The most popular position is the cradle hold:


Start by holding the baby upright on the shoulder opposite the first panel of fabric (the shoulder panel closest to the body). Then carefully place the baby into the first panel of fabric, in a seated position. Spread the fabric wide to cover the baby's bottom, back and shoulders. Continue to support the baby with your arm as you do this.
Place the baby's legs into the second panel of fabric (the shoulder panel on the opposite side). Then find the third panel (the one that goes around your waist) and pull it up to cover the baby.

Prepare to take your baby’s measurements.,
Position your baby.,
Measure your baby’s feet.,
Note the measurements.",How to Measure Baby Feet2," Grab a tape measure, and enlist someone else to help you keep your child still.

, Have your baby stand as still as possible (have someone else help minimize the squirming and fidgeting).

, For each foot, put the broad side of the tape measure against the outside, with the end of the tape measure either on the tip of the big toe or the end of the heel.


For best results, measure two or three times. Babies wiggle a lot, and it can be difficult to get an accurate measurement.

, Write down your measurements, and shop accordingly.

, Have your baby sit in someone else’s lap or in a comfortable chair, with his or her knees bent at a 90-degree angle.

, Make sure your child’s heel sits against the gauge’s heel rest. Check that the gauge is parallel to the floor and that your baby’s ankles are at a 90-degree angle as well.

, Move the toe slide until it touches the tip of your baby’s big toe. Take note of the length measurement shown in the circular window, indicated by the black lines on its sides. Add any extra millimeters in the side panel.


For best results, make sure that your baby’s toes aren’t bent. Gently press them down against the gauge with your thumb as you measure.

, Use the width tape to measure. It should be placed automatically at the correct part of the foot. Don’t pull too much; if you do, you may wind up with a tight measurement. Note the width. , If you live in U.K. or E.U., simply go to the Clark size calculator online (at http://www.clarks.co.uk/sizecalculator) and enter your data. The site will tell you the correct shoe size to purchase.

Use size 1 diapers to form the stroller.,
Form the wheels of the stroller.,
Consider making axles for the wheels.,
Connect the wheels with the paper towel roll axles.,
Build the carriage of the stroller.",How to Make a Diaper Stroller1," There are many different ways of assembling a diaper stroller, some more complicated than others, so the list of materials varies depending on the desired finished product. However, since most newborn babies wear size 1, that is the best diaper size to use.


If multiple babies are expected, the person can make a different looking diaper stroller for each one.;
, To form the wheels, six to eight diapers can be curled around each other and held in place with a rubber band or tape. They do not have to make a perfectly round wheel, but should be firm enough to support the weight of the rest of the diaper stroller without looking flat.


Remember that a stroller has four wheels, so you will need approximately 24 to 32 diapers to form the wheels.
To make the diaper stroller as festive as possible, you could also think of using ribbons to hold the wheels together, or even just some colorful tape.

, You can use paper towel tubes to form axles for the wheels. Once you have formed the wheels, bend the center diaper slightly so that a small hole is formed. Insert the paper towel roll into the hole so that it is in the center of the wheel. You should only need two rolls, as you will be putting one roll through two of the wheels, so as to hold the wheels together.


Consider placing a small gift inside the center of the roll.

, Once you have put a paper towel roll through the center of one of the wheels, put the same roll through the center of another one of the wheels. Connect two different wheels with the same roll, and then connect the other two wheels with a different roll. This should form two sets of connected wheels.


While you do not have to do this, connecting the wheels can help to make your stroller sturdy.

, The main part of the stroller is usually made with roughly 30 to 40 diapers, though the number you use is up to you. Stack the diapers in rows of five or so and connect them with tape or rubber bands to form the flat carriage, or main part, of the stroller.


Consider putting a receiving blanket over the diapers that make up the body of the stroller. This is not necessary, but may be a nice extra gift.

Purchase your supplies.,
Wrap the hoop in yarn.,
Create your fabric/felt shapes.,
Sew your shapes together.,
Stuff your mobile pieces with batting.,
Cut pieces of thread.,
Attach thread to the fabric/felt pieces.,
Connect your thread to the hoop.,
Attach strong thread to the hoop to hang.,
Position your mobile.,
Hang your mobile.",How to Make a Baby Mobile1," For this kind of mobile you will need a metal hoop or ring, about 10 inches in diameter, several different colors of felt and/or fabric, strong thread, cotton balls or batting, and yarn. The felt, fabric, yarn, and thread, can be in any colors you want.


For this project you will also need a pair of scissors and a needle. You can choose to use hot glue or tacky glue if you aren't comfortable with your sewing skills.;
, Taking the metal hoop that you bought, wrap it in your yarn until you have completely covered the metal. This is what the fabric and felt will hang from. Start by tying a bow when you first begin to wrap your yarn. After you have wrapped the entire hoop, untie the first bow that you made, and then tie it in a knot with the other end of the yarn. Cut any remaining yarn.It could be fun to wrap the hoop in a brightly colored yarn, or you can keep it simple by wrapping it in a white yarn.
Make sure that you keep the yarn tight together as you wrap it so that none of the metal will show through. You'll want to give yourself a good thirty minutes to do this, and try to do it in one setting so the yarn doesn't unravel.

, Here you have lots of room to create whatever shapes you like and be creative. Cut your fabric or felt out in your desired shapes, making sure to cut two of each shape so you can sew them together. You can make as many shapes as you want, but a good start is making at least three shapes, with two cut-outs of each shape.


To come up with shape ideas, think about the theme of your baby's room. Maybe you want to make little clouds, flowers, hot air balloons, dinosaurs, or stars. Use your creativity to make different shapes suited for your baby. If you aren't sure what to make or you need help creating the shapes, you can find pictures of the shapes online, print them out, and then trace them onto your felt or fabric.

, Take your needle and thread, and sew your cut-outs of your shapes together. Flip your pieces around so that their fronts are against each other, and then match the pieces of fabric or felt up so that they are lined up together. Begin by sewing around your shape until you have about an inch left of fabric to sew. Then, turn your fabric right side out.


You can sew your shapes with a needle and thread, or you can use a yarn needle and your yarn for a thicker seam. It's your personal preference what kind of seam you want. A yarn seam can be a really cute addition to a baby mobile, especially if you have used felt fabric, but a regular thread stitch looks great too. If you sew with yarn, you'll want to match the shapes with their right side out, because you won't be flipping them once you have sewn. The yarn stitch will be outside of the fabric instead of inside the fabric.

, Now that you've sewn most of the way around your pieces, you'll want to stuff them with cotton balls or batting to give them some depth. Fill your shapes with as much stuffing as you want, and then sew them up so that the stuffing does not come out. Then, cut off any remaining thread., You will need the same number of pieces of thread as the number of fabric shapes you have made. You can cut your thread equal lengths, or you can cut them in different lengths so that some shapes hang down lower than others. Make sure you use light weight thread here as your shapes may not be heavy enough to pull down heavy thread.


You can also use fishing line here if you want your connections to be less noticeable. Whatever connection you choose to use, make sure you cut pieces that are longer than your desired length, as you'll need some extra thread to sew into your shapes.
To figure out the length of your thread you may try holding your mobile up above your crib or in your baby's room, and then holding the shapes underneath it at your desired length. Then, cut a piece of thread for each shape that is long enough to connect the shape to your hoop, with a few extra inches for sewing.

, Take pieces of thread and attach them to your fabric pieces by sewing them to one of the seams. Make sure to start sewing the thread into the side of your shape, and then finish once you have reached the middle, top of your piece. This will ensure that your shape hangs straight. Once you have reached the middle of your shape, tie a knot in the thread but don't cut it.


You can also sew a line straight down the middle your shape. Start the thread in the middle, center of your shape and sew a line upwards, to the top middle of your shape. This could be a good idea if the color thread you are using is the same as the color of the shape.

, With your remaining thread, bring it up to your yarn hoop, and connect it by tying a secure knot around the hoop. You'll want to space your thread out evenly around the hoop so that your shapes hang an equal distance from each other. If you want more security with the knots, after you have tied them you can glue them to the inside of your yarn hoop with hot glue.

, In order to hang your hoop, you'll need to attach three pieces of thread to your hoop, equal distance apart. The pieces should be about 36 inches long. Once you have attached your pieces around the hoop, tie a loose knot in the middle of the thread by taking the three pieces of thread and wrapping them around each other., After you have tied your loose knot, hang your mobile to figure out the perfect angle. You'll want the hoop to lie flat, so you'll need your knot to be in a place that doesn't cause your hoop to lean one way or another. Once you have the right angle for your hoop, secure the knot on the thread.


Once you have done this you should see your hoop with three threads connected to it, that meet in the middle to form a knot. Then, the rest of the threads will be used to hang your mobile.

, With your remaining thread, tie a loop at the very end of it so that you can hang it onto a hook. To make the loop, loop the end of the thread so you have a small loop, and then tie it to the hanging thread with a double knot. Hang your mobile up, and if you decide you want it shorter you can cut some of your thread and tie the loop lower.

Make a pillow for the stroller.,
Create the hood for the stroller.,
Add decorative finishing touches.,
Fill the stroller with gifts.",How to Make a Diaper Stroller2," You can also use a smaller bundle of diapers covered in a second receiving blanket to form a pillow inside the diaper stroller. This will most likely take six to eight diapers connected with tape so that they form the shape of a rectangle pillow.

, The hood of the stroller can be made of several diapers that are stacked and bent slightly to form the curve of the hood.


It can also be made from another blanket that is folded over the end of the stroller and propped up with the diapers that form the pillow.

, Once the diapers have taken on the basic form of a stroller, finishing touches can be added. Put your own personal touches on it. Add accessories like ribbons, balloons, or even baby shower decorations like tiny plastic baby bottles.


Consider stenciling or stamping the baby’s name onto a piece of paper and attacking it to the front or back of the stroller like a license plate.

, If you plan to give more gifts, consider putting the gifts in the center of the baby carriage. You could wrap the gifts, or simply fill the stroller. Cute gifts include:


Stuffed animals, dolls, blankets, washcloths, or baby clothing.

Gather your supplies.,
Cut out circles in your paper.,
Position your circles.,
Place your remaining circles until you have used them all.,
Attach your yarn or thread to your circles.,
Paint your embroidery hoop.,
Attach the yarn to your hoop and hang your circles.,
Hang your mobile.",How to Make a Baby Mobile2," For this type of mobile you will need different colors of construction paper or card stock, an embroidery hoop, yarn or thread, and hot glue or tacky glue. Your mobile will be more secure if you use a sewing machine instead of glue, but you can use glue for the sake of simplicity.

, You can cut any shape you choose, but circles are the easiest. If you want an ombre or multi-colored paper mobile, use five different colors and cut them as follows:Color #1: twenty-two, two inch circles
Color #2: seven, two inch circles, and 11, 1.6 inch circles
Color #3: 19, 1.6 inch circles
Color #4: 11, 1.6 inch circles, and nine, 1.3 inch circles
Color #5: 22, 1.3 inch circles

, Lay out your circles on the ground, in the order that you want them. To use the above circle numbers and colors, create 11 columns of circles. You will then lay your colored circles in rows across the columns until you have used all of your circles. Your columns will not be an even length, but this will make your mobile look more fun.First, lay your color #1 circles in two rows with an inch between each row. You will have two rows of the same color with 11 circles in each row and two circles in each column.
On your third row, you will start by laying your color #2 circles, alternating between sizes. In your first column, lay one of your two inch circles. Then, in your second column lay a 1.6 inch circle and underneath that in a fourth row lay your two inch circle. Then, in your next column lay your two inch circle, and in the fourth column repeat your second column (lay a 1.6 inch circle and below that lay a two inch circle). Continue to alternate these until you have used all of that color.
For your third color, you can begin to place the circles out randomly. For example, on column one you can use two circles, on column two you can use two circles, and then on column three you can use one circle. Place the circles in these columns with one inch separating them, but have fun in placing them randomly. There doesn't have to be a specific order, and it's okay if on one column you already have a ton of circles and on another you only have three or four. You will fill in the gaps with the remaining colors.

, As with the previous step, you will begin to place your remaining circles in a random order on your mobile. It looks best if you place all of one color at once, meaning you don't place color #3, then #4, then #3 again in the same column. Try to group the colors together when you place them. After you have placed all of your colors, you can go back and make the changes you want.


Your columns should be all relatively even, with only one or two circles difference between the column length. You don't want one column to have 5 circles and another column to have 15, so make sure that they are somewhat close to the same length. They don't have to be perfect, though, meaning the space between your circles doesn't have to be the exact same length. Sometimes it looks better if it looks like you didn't try to make the space perfect -- then it looks like the randomness was intentional.

, Take your yarn or thread and cut out 11 pieces, each piece long enough to cover the length of your circles with two inches remaining. Then, place your yarn along your circles and begin to glue each circle to the yarn. Make sure you glue the yarn to the entire diameter of the circle so that the circle doesn't bend over.This is the step where it may look better if you use a sewing machine. If you choose to take on that task, use thread instead of yarn and push each circle through your machine. To use your machine simply place a circle under the presser foot, sew it, and then pull the thread some before you place your next circle down. Don't stop your machine between each circle. You won't need any special thread or needles -- so it can make this project much easier by using a sewing machine.
If you choose to use glue, yarn is better to use than thread because it will hold better against your paper.

, Choose a color for your hoop and paint it before you attach your circles. It can look good to use the same color for your hoop as your first row of circles, so that there is some uniformity. Let your hoop dry before you attach the yarn.

, Take the end of the yarn and tie knots around your hoop, securing all your strings to the hoop. You'll want to space these out somewhat evenly, but because there are so many strings, it won't be very noticeable if some of your circles are closer than others.

, Following the final steps in the previous section, attach your thread to your hoop, and tie a knot to connect the three strands. Then, position your hoop as you would like it and secure the knot. Hang it on your wall and enjoy!

Cut your ribbon.,
Tie the ribbon around the mobile.,
Tie the ribbon to hang your mobile.,
Hang your mobile.",How to Make a Baby Mobile3," For this mobile you will need about 10 to 20 spools of ribbon and an embroidery hoop. You can choose to use different colors of ribbon, or you can use one or two colors, depending on the variety you desire for your mobile. Basically, you'll need enough ribbon so that you have enough to cover the circumference of your mobile, with each ribbon being doubled up.

, You will use your ribbon to cover the entire circumference of your embroidery hoop. Each piece of ribbon needs to be long enough to double over and knot around the embroidery hoop. So if you want your ribbons to be a foot in length, then you'll want to cut your length of ribbon to be about 26 inches in length. Your ribbon might look better if you cut different lengths, so you can vary each length of ribbon by one or two inches.To figure out how much ribbon you will need, place your embroidery hoop on the floor. Then, take a piece of ribbon and place it over the hoop. Do this until you have covered the entire hoop with ribbon. Then, you'll know how much ribbon to cut for your mobile.

, With each piece of ribbon you cut, double it over, so that both ends meet each other. Then, place the folded end over your embroidery hoop. Take the rest of the ribbon and stick it through the loop of the fold, creating a full circle around your hoop. Pull tight, and your ribbon should create a knot around your embroidery hoop.


It's best if you use relatively thin ribbon here, because you will be able to create tighter knots. If your ribbon is too thick, your knot won't stay secure and you may have to glue the ribbon to the hoop.

, Take two pieces of ribbon, about three feet long, and tie each end of the ribbon to the hoop. Tie one end of the ribbon to one side of the hoop, and tie the other end to the opposite side, exactly across from the previous end. Then, take your second ribbon and tie one end in between the other two ends, exactly in the middle. Then tie the other end across from the previous end.Once you are done tying you should have your ribbons evenly spaced on your hoop, at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 hands of a clock.

, Attach a hook to your ceiling and hang your mobile by taking the middle of the ribbons you just tied and placing them on the hook. Your mobile may lean one way or another, so you may have to position your ribbons so that the hoop of your mobile lies flat.

Wrap the wreath in ribbon.,
Cut your flowers.,
Pin your flowers to the wreath.,
Attach ribbons to the wreath.,
Position and hang your mobile.",How to Make a Baby Mobile4," For this mobile you will need silk flowers, thick ribbon, straight pins, and a straw or styrofoam wreath. A 12 inch wreath will be a good size, and you'll need several bouquets of flowers.

, Start by attaching the ribbon to the inside of your wreath with two straight pins (push the pins into the wreath). Then, wrap your wreath in the ribbon until it is fully covered. If you have lots of ribbon to spare you may want to wrap it tightly so that the ribbon continually overlaps. This will prevent your wreath from showing through. Then, secure the end of the ribbon inside your wreath with two more straight pins.It's easier to wrap your wreath if you leave the packaging on. Styrofoam wreaths don't always have packaging, but straw wreaths generally do. This will keep the straw from falling out of the wreath.

, Take your flowers and cut off any excess leaves, stems, or parts of the flower that you don't like. The flowers will need to be relatively flat, and you want each bloom to be an individual, meaning you don't want to leave the flowers connected to one another. You can use different colored flowers here, but one flower would look pretty as well.

, Hold your wreath and place each flower on the outside of the wreath, securing it with pins. Make sure you place the pin as far inside the flower as you can so it doesn't show. Cover the entire wreath with flowers. You can use glue here instead to attach your flowers, but pinning is easier and will provide a more secure hold for the flower.You don't want to place the flower on the wreath as if you were hanging it from a door. Instead, imagine your wreath is flat on the ground. You want to place your flowers on the side of the wreath, that is more perpendicular to the ground, rather than the top of the wreath that is parallel with your ground. Place your flowers around the wreath as if you are creating a crown.

, Take two ribbons and attach them to the wreath as you did in the previous section, on the 12, 3, 6, and 9 points of a clock. Because your mobile doesn't have anything hanging from it, your ribbons will need to be much longer. Cut your ribbons four to five feet each so that when you hang them the mobile will hang down about two to two and a half feet from the ceiling.It may be better to start off with longer ribbon, because you can always cut it if it's too long. If you cut your ribbon too short, you will have to cut another length of ribbon to make it longer.

, Hang the ribbons from a hook attached to your ceiling and position your mobile so that the wreath is parallel with the ceiling. If you find it is too long you can always trim the ribbon and reattach it to your wreath.


This wreath is a simple, yet elegant mobile. You can make it more exciting by adding different types of flowers, or you can keep it elegant by using a white or off white flower with a solid color ribbon.

Talk to your dentist.",How to Know If a Baby is Teething," There is a wide age range for when babies start teething. Some parents may notice signs as early as three months, with the tooth pushing through the gum between four and seven months. Most children will have all 20 of their primary teeth by the age of three.Looking for the signs of teething can alert you to examine your baby’s mouth for teeth, soothe his discomfort, and clean your baby’s mouth of bacteria.Be aware that some babies will exhibit no signs of teething. In these cases, checking your baby’s mouth can alert you to teeth pushing through.;
, If you suspect your baby is teething, you may want to check to see if you see any signs around her mouth. You can do this by checking the skin around the mouth and then looking inside your baby’s mouth.Make sure that your hands and fingers are clean before you examine your baby’s mouth to keep any bacteria that can cause infection at bay.
Check to see if you notice any drooling or if your baby’s mouth is extra wet. This is a good sign that your baby is about to start or is already teething.
Look for a facial rash or rosy skin on your baby when you check for drooling. Developing a facial rash is often a sign that babies are teething. It may not be particularly dark, but if your baby’s skin appears more pink or red than normal, this could be a rash developing.
Peel back your baby’s lip very gently to examine her gums. Be aware that you may see bulging gums, especially around the molars. In other cases, you may notice a buildup of fluid that creates a bluish cyst. This is completely normal and you should leave it alone.Massage your baby’s gums as you feel for teeth or hard spots. This can provide a bit of relief to your baby while helping you figure out if she is teething.

, Most babies will exhibit some physical symptoms of teething before the first tooth pushes through his gums. Many babies will bite or suck on toys, fingers, or other objects. If you notice that your baby seems to be biting or sucking things more often, this is a likely sign he is about to start or has begun teething.Check if your baby is rubbing his gums with the items on which he is sucking or biting. Many teething babies will rub their gums in addition to sucking and biting.

, Babies often associate the pain of teething with their ears. If you notice your baby pulling or batting at her ears in addition to other symptoms, she may be teething.Be aware that it is common for babies to pull or play with their ears out of curiosity. However, it can also be a sign of ear infection. If you are not sure if the pulling is related to teething or an ear infection, which can be serious if left untreated, call your pediatrician.
Other signs that point toward an ear infection include a fever, having a cold, or acting fussy when pulling the ears, lying down, or drinking from a bottle.

, If your baby’s cheeks or skin is pinker or feels warm to the touch, he may be running a mild temperature because of teething; however, you should be aware that teething will only cause a slight increase in temperature. If your baby is running a high fever, he could be teething and have something causing the fever. In this case, call the doctor to check if your baby needs to be seen., In addition to the physical symptoms of teething your baby might have, she might also exhibit behavioral signs. Two of the most common behavioral symptoms are irritability and excessive crying.See if your baby is fussier than usual or even irritable despite attempts to comfort her. This can be a result of pain or discomfort your baby feels from teething. You may notice that your baby’s fussiness or irritability is worse in the evening because tooth eruption is more active at night.Listen if your baby is crying more than usual or over the course of a few days. This may signal teething, especially if your baby has other symptoms; however, you should also be aware that excessive crying can be a sign of gas, colic, or another medical condition such as an ear infection., Because teething can cause your baby discomfort in his mouth, it may affect his eating habits or patterns. Make sure to pay close attention to how much or if your baby is eating, which can signal a tooth erupting or the onset of teething.Watch to see if your baby suddenly prefers nursing or bottle-feeding if he usually eats solids. This can be the result of a spoon or fork irritating your baby’s inflamed gums; however, your baby may prefer eating solids because the counter pressure  from the utensils feels good on his gums.
Recognize that your baby may pull back from nursing or bottle-feeding because sucking puts uncomfortable pressure on his gums and ear canals.
Make sure to take your baby to the pediatrician if he is refusing to eat. This can be a result of teething or another condition. In either case, your doctor can help diagnose and treat the problem.

, Because tooth eruption happens mostly at night, the teething process may disrupt your baby’s ability to sleep at night and even nap. Note changes in your baby’s evening habits, including wakefulness or disrupted sleep. Your baby may also experience disruption to her nap schedule. If your baby has these symptoms along with other signs of teething, she may be getting ready to cut teeth.Remember that disrupted sleep from teething can also cause or increase your baby’s irritability or fussiness.

, Giving your baby’s gums a gentle massage can relieve any discomfort he is feeling. In addition, this can help you feel any teeth pushing through or potential problems with your baby’s mouth.Wash your hands before you massage your baby’s gums. Be sure to thoroughly rinse off any soap residue your baby could ingest.
Use one or two fingers to rub your baby’s gums. Apply gentle pressure and rub his gums in a circular motion.

, If you notice any signs of teething in your baby, especially drooling, use a cool washcloth to your baby’s benefit. Not only can this soothe your baby’s discomfort, but it can also prevent a rash from developing on her mouth as well as remove bacteria buildup.Use a clean washcloth washed in an unscented detergent for sensitive skin to ensure that this doesn’t irritate your baby’s delicate skin or gums. Run the washcloth under cool or cold water and wring out any excess moisture.
Wipe the cloth over any parts of your baby’s mouth where there is drool. After this, gently open your baby’s mouth and massage her gums with the washcloth. Both of these can help remove bacteria buildup inside and outside your baby’s mouth.Start your regimen of massaging and cleaning your baby’s gums as soon as you can. Ideally, you’d start this immediately after her birth., The counter pressure of chewing on a teething implement can help relieve any discomfort you baby is feeling. From teething rings to teething biscuits, you can try any number of different toys to soothe your baby.Put a moist washcloth in the refrigerator or freezer for 30 minutes and allow your baby to chew on it. Make sure to not let the washcloth get rock hard because it can bruise your baby’s swollen gums.
Chill a rubber teething ring in the refrigerator and give it to your baby. Be aware that you should never put rubber teething rings in the freezer or boil it to sterilize it. These extreme temperature changes can damage the rubber or plastic and cause it to leak chemicals. You should also make sure to never tie a teething ring around your baby’s neck, as this risks strangulation.

, Anything cool can help relieve your baby’s discomfort. Let your baby have a cold drink or a cold food to help him feel better. This may also help a baby who is having trouble eating because of discomfort get vital nutrients.Let your baby drink a bottle of ice or icy cold water if he is over six months. If your baby is under six months, he can have a small amount (1–2oz) of ice-free water from a bottle or cup. Don't give water to babies more than one to two times per day unless recommended by your doctor.
Give your baby chilled foods such as yogurt, blended peaches, or applesauce to soothe gums. You can also give him popsicles or freeze fruits such as bananas and plums in a baby feeder mesh bag. This bag will keep gummed-off food from choking your baby. Only give your baby teething biscuits or frozen and cold foods only if he is already eating solids.Make sure your baby is sitting upright when you provide these options., If your baby is older than six months, you can give her a dose of ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Younger babies can take acetaminophen with approval from your doctor. Pain medication can relieve discomfort and irritability. Make sure to consult with your baby’s pediatrician before giving her any pain relievers.Consider giving your baby a baby-formulated pain reliever of ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Follow the packaging instructions for dosing or ask your pediatrician if you are unsure.
Remember that you should never give your child aspirin unless specifically directed by your doctor. Aspirin consumption in children can lead to Reye’s syndrome in children., There are a lot of remedies that can soothe a teething baby, but there are also some from which you should steer clear. Alcoholic remedies and teething gels or tablets can be harmful to your baby’s health.Avoid doing the following to relieve discomfort in a teething baby:


Placing an aspirin against a tooth or the gums
Rubbing alcohol on your baby’s gums
Giving your baby a teething tablet
Massaging teething or numbing gels on your baby’s gums, because some of them contain medicines that can be dangerous for babies
Putting an amber necklace on your baby because they don’t work and pose a choking hazardDabbing whiskey on your baby’s gums can sedate the child and be dangerous

, If you are concerned about your baby’s teething process, schedule an appointment with your dentist. A dental examination can alert your dentist to potential problems and help the dentist develop a treatment for them.


Let your dentist know about your specific concerns. You may want to inform your dentist about what signs and symptoms of teething your baby has exhibited as well as anything you’ve done to relieve them.

,, Cut at the correct length, leaving a little extra space. Cut a few longer pieces for streamers. If you would like to write something on one of the streamers (the baby's name, etc.), do so now. You can make a bow, or cut several pieces at a time to build a bow, by looping and gluing one piece at a time.

, Apply hot glue sparingly, beginning in the top center to the back of the handle of the broom. Place one of the cut ends of the ribbon on the first glue dot and press, allow to dry. Then slowly wrap the handle, leaving small gaps, so that the broom can be seen; once to the end, apply a dab of glue, press and hold. Snip any excess ribbon off.

, The goal is to place the ribbon on the broom section; thus you need to decide how you want the broom to be hung up, for that will make a big difference in what direction to place the ribbon. Before adding the streamers be sure the word (Welcome or baby's name) has been already applied; then carefully glue pieces up under the bow, by simply lifting the edges of the bow and applying dabs of glue...then follow suit...same as above. See tip below for streamers.

, These items can be glued on, or tied on by using thin ribbon. If using glue just follow the same step as for ribbon. See suggestion under Tips.

Monitor your crawling baby closely when changing them on an elevated surface.,
Use a safety harness when strapping your crawling baby in.,
Install safety gates in front of stairways.,
Cover the space between bannisters if necessary.,
Position low furniture away from windows.,
Remove all climbable objects from your crawling baby’s bed.",How to Keep Your Crawling Baby Safe1," If you’re changing your crawling baby on a countertop or table, they might roll or crawl over the edge if you’re not around to monitor them. Therefore, you must always be watchful and stay by your crawling baby when they are on an elevated surface.It’s best to change your baby on the floor on a changing mat or towel. This will prevent your crawling baby from being hurt in a fall.
Even a relatively low elevation like a sofa or chair could be high enough for a crawling baby to really hurt themselves if they fall.Some changing pads have straps to help hold the baby in, but you should never leave your baby unattended even if you use these.;
, If you put your baby in a baby carriage or high chair, ensure that your crawling baby won’t crawl out by strapping your baby in with a five-point harness. A five-point harness is a piece of safety equipment that ties around the crawling baby’s waist, crotch, and shoulders to keep them from crawling out of the place they’re meant to remain. If your crawling baby is not safely strapped in, they could crawl out and get hurt in the fall., Safety gates are removable barriers that prevent the passage of crawling babies from leaving a certain area. While adults can easily step over safety gates, for crawling babies, safety gates are an impenetrable obstacle.Do not use older accordion-style gates. They might trap your crawling baby if they put their head through them., If your baby is crawling about on an upper story and your home has an area of bannisters along a walkway, they might fall through the bannisters if they are spaced further than 2.5 inches (6.5 cm) apart. In this case, cover the bannisters with boards or a safety net., Crawling babies are very creative. If your low furniture is close to windows, your crawling baby might clamber onto a chair or sofa and crawl right out of an open window. Your baby might also open a closed window and crawl out. Fit your windows with locks or safety catches that make it impossible to open the window more than 2.5 inches (6.5 cm).Ensure that you and the other adults in the house know where the keys for the safety catches or locks are to get through the window in case of fire (or in case you just want to let in a nice breeze).

, If your crawling baby has any toys or bumpers in their cot, they might climb or crawl on them to escape.In so doing, your crawling baby might take a nasty fall and get hurt. To prevent this from happening, remove these toys and bumpers from the crawling baby’s bed."

Cut a long piece 1½-inch (38-millimter) wide ribbon.,
Seal and knot the ends of the ribbon.,
Determine how long you need to cut the tulle.,
Cut a cardboard template according to that measurement.,
Buy 2 different colors of tulle ribbon.,
Wrap the tulle around the cardboard.,
Cut both ends of the tulle.,
Cut the tulle strips in half lengthwise.,
Repeat the process with your second color.,
Loop a tulle strip around the ribbon.,
Loop the rest of the tulle strips around the ribbon.,
Secure the tutu to the high chair with Velcro.",How to Make a High Chair Tutu1," It needs to be long enough to wrap around the table and back rest of the high chair, plus about 14 inches (35.56 centimeters).;
, Hold the cut ends of the ribbon near a flame for a few seconds. This melts the ribbon and seals them, thus preventing fraying. Tie a knot into the ribbon 7 inches (17.78 centimeters) away from each cut end., Decide how long you want the tutu to be. Double that length, then add 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters).

, The cardboard needs to be a little wider than your tulle. You will be wrapping the tulle around this in the next step.

, Tulle ribbon is also called tulle on a spool. It is 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) wide tulle sold on a spool. You can typically find it in the bridal section of an arts and crafts shop. If you can't find any, buy regular tulle, and cut it into 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) wide strips.


Make sure that the colors go well together. Consider having one solid color and one glittery one.

, Place the end of the tulle strip against one of the narrow ends of the cardboard. Wrap the tulle around the cardboard template. Be careful not to pull too hard, or the tulle will stretch.Wrap the tulle a few times around the cardboard; you will need to do this process a few times.
If the tulle slips too much, secure it with double-sided tape.

, Slip it off the cardboard when you are done. Now, you will have twice as many strips of tulle. This is just like making a pompom, except that you won't be tying it in the middle.

, You will end up with 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) wide strips of tulle. A quick way to do this would be to fold it in half a few times widthwise, then cut it in half down the middle., You can have the same amount as your first color, or fewer. You can also do more colors, but make sure that they all go together. Plan on having one strip of tulle per inch (2.54 centimeters) of ribbon.

, Lay the ribbon out in front of you, right-side-up. Fold a tulle strip in half, widthwise. Place it behind the ribbon, with the folded end pointing down. Pull the loose ends of the tulle across the ribbon and down through the loop. Tug on the ends to tighten the knot.Start looping the tulle after the first knot on the ribbon.

, As you finish knotting a tulle strip, push it up against the last one. This will make the tutu nice and fluffy. If you run out of tulle strips, simply make more.


Finish looping the tulle before the last knot on the ribbon.
Have a pattern in mind. Try four strips of your base color, then one strip of your accent color.

, Place a few self-adhesive Velcro squares or circles onto the back of the tutu. Place the matching Velcro pieces onto the high chair. Wrap the tutu around the high chair, then tie the 7-inch (17.78-centimeter) ends into a bow.Use your fingers to comb through the tulle and make it lay nicer.

Remain patient with your baby.",How to Stop Breastfeeding Without Pain," Begin the weaning process in a gradual, slow manner. Any abrupt cessation of breastfeeding will confuse your body and cause pain (or worse) from engorgement. If you abruptly stop nursing, your body is less likely to handle the transition smoothly, and you are more likely to experience pain.


Your body has prepared itself to meet your baby’s nutritional needs based on how often your baby nurses. Your body has not been prepared to stop producing milk at a quick rate. It needs time to realize that the milk is no longer needed.
Painful side effects of stopping abruptly include engorgement, mastitis, and plugged ducts.If you wean gradually, it will take as long for your milk to dry up as it does to wean, which means anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. If you stop breastfeeding suddenly, the length of time for your milk to dry up depends on how much milk you are producing at the time. If you are producing a lot of milk, it can still take several weeks or months.;
, Your baby will most likely let you know when he or she is ready to wean, such as an interest in solid food and a loss of interest in nursing. However, babies should not be taken completely off of mother’s milk or formula until at least 12 months, and they should not drink cow’s milk until this age as well.


You can follow the philosophy of baby-lead weaning, which means allowing the baby to eat table food whenever he or she starts reaching for food.Your baby will gradually eat more food than breast milk over the next few months.
Follow your intuition with regards to your baby’s readiness for weaning. Remember that you are the mother and no one can know your baby better than you. Listen to your baby.
Remember that every baby is different. Every mother is different too. Learn from the experiences of others but don't take them as gospel if you feel differently. Your own experiences are your best guide.
At around five to six months, babies may want other foods despite not having teeth. You can tell they are ready for food by increased fussiness, ability to sit up without much help, watching you eat with interest, and chewing motions.Some people think that you have to start weaning when the baby starts teething, but this is not true. It is okay to keep breast feeding your baby even when he starts teething. Just keep in mind that some babies will bite when they are nursing after they develop teeth, but gently telling your baby this is not okay should be enough to make him stop.

, To get to the point where food is the main source of nutrition, you should begin slowly. Baby’s digestive system is still developing, and he or she will need either breastmilk or formula until about 12 months. Start at around four months with baby cereal and progress to table food.


When introducing an exclusively breastfed baby to food for the first time, express some breastmilk and mix it into a single-grain baby cereal. This will make it more appetizing and easier for the baby to chew. Food should be introduced at around six months.Between four and eight months, you can introduce pureed fruits, veggies, and meats.
At nine to 12 months, you can offer non-pureed finger foods such as rice, teething biscuits, and ground meat.

, If your baby nurses every three hours, at around nine months you can start nursing every four to five hours.Or you can simply skip over baby’s least favorite feeding (or the most difficult feeding) and see if your baby notices. If not, keep skipping it.A few days or weeks later, skip another nursing and see if your baby notices. If your baby continues to adapt to the skipped feedings, you can continue this trend up until the last feeding.
You may want to keep the early morning and bedtime feedings until the very end. For one thing, you have more milk in the morning after a long night without nursing, so keeping this feeding will prevent engorgement. And the evening feeding is probably part of a comforting bedtime routine, as well as a way to help baby feel full and sleep better. The evening feeding is usually the last one to go.Cut out middle of the night feedings by having your partner or someone else comfort the baby., If you are trying to wean before your baby is 12 months old, you need to replace breastmilk with formula. Substituting breastmilk with formula one feeding at a time for several weeks each will eventually wean both you and the baby.Experiment by switching out the breast for the bottle. If you usually offer the breast each time the baby wants to feed, try offering the bottle first and see what happens.
Alternatively, if you nurse the baby to sleep, when they are just starting to fall asleep, slip the breast out of their mouth and slip in the bottle's nipple. This may help your baby get used to the taste and the bottle nipple without even realizing it.
If your baby won’t take a bottle, try different things, like having someone else (like dad) try, offering the bottle when the baby is tired, or use a sippy cup instead.
If your baby is over 12 months, you can substitute breastmilk with whole cow’s milk.

, If you are mostly or exclusively pumping, you still need to wean off of pumping and take your time doing so. The same principles of weaning from the breast apply: reduce the number of pumping sessions per day. The first step is to reduce to two pumpings a day, preferably 12 hours apart.Wait a few days between dropping pumpings.
Once you are down to two pumping sessions per day, reduce the length of each pumping session.
Then reduce it to one pumping per day, staying here for a few days.
Reduce the duration of this last pumping session.
Once you are only getting two or three ounces from a pumping session, you can stop pumping altogether.
All the same steps apply to weaning from pumping if you feel engorged, blocked ducts, or general pain.

, Cold compresses, like a gel ice pack or cold wash cloth, can restrict blood vessels in the breasts, leading to lowered milk production. Cold compresses can also reduce pain and raise your comfort level.There are bras on the market that come with gel packs you can freeze and slip inside a pocket over your breast.
If you don’t want to spend money, just get a washcloth wet with ice-cold water and slip it between your breast and the bra cup. Replace the cloth often or freeze it first, as body heat makes cloths warm up very quickly.

, Both activities can make your body think the baby is sucking and that you need to produce more milk. This of course defeats the purpose of drying up your milk.However, if you are truly engorged, it’s not safe to leave the milk there as it can block ducts. Instead, hand express or pump out just enough milk to relieve the pain. Be careful to only pump this small amount, and your body will still decrease its milk supply.A warm shower can assist in hand expressing the milk, but you should not use this as a solution often, as it can increase milk supply.
Place some nursing pads against your nipples if leakage becomes a problem, which it can if you become engorged. Many women are embarrassed when leakage presents itself through their clothing. The pads are an effective way to promote absorption.

, Cabbage leaves have been used for centuries to help hasten the drying up process of breastmilk. To create a place for cabbage compresses to remain stationary, wear a well-fitting bra even during sleep. Too small or too large of a bra will be uncomfortable.


Cabbage leaves release enzymes that encourage the drying up process, so be sure to crush the leaves by folding or rolling them with a rolling pin before applying to your breasts; this releases the enzymes.Place one large, cool cabbage leaf into each cup of your bra and keep replacing them when they are wilted for 24 to 48 hours.
Avoid bras that contain underwire.
If the cabbage leaves don’t work after a few days, stop using them and find another method for reducing pain and drying up milk, like cold compresses.

, Start a massage routine immediately if you feel lumps in your breasts. If this occurs, it probably signifies that a plugged milk duct is present. Begin paying extra attention to the area and increase massage time to it. The point is to break the plug up with massage.


Warm showers can be beneficial in helping massage work more effectively, but they are not recommended, as warm water can increase milk production.
Place warm compresses, like a warm wash cloth, on the breast before massaging and a cold compress, like a cold pack or cold wash cloth, after massaging.Watch for the development of any sore, red areas, or a fever. This can indicate mastitis.
Seek medical attention if the massage efforts fail to unplug a duct within a day or so. If the symptoms worsen or if fever takes place, it is possible that the plugged duct has progressed to a condition known as mastitis. If you suspect that this is the case, contact your healthcare provider immediately, as mastitis can have serious complications if not treated quickly and properly.

, Speak to your healthcare provider about the use of ibuprofen as a pain reducer if pain becomes too great to bear and no home remedies are working.


A medication called paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, can also offer relief., Keep in mind that the hormonal changes of reducing milk supply can affect your moods. Weaning is a psychological experience as well as physical. Allow yourself to feel whatever it is that you are feeling.


Don’t be ashamed of wanting to cry during weaning. You will probably feel a bit sad, and tears are a way to help you grieve the end of this season of closeness with your baby.

, Continue to eat a well-balanced diet and stay hydrated. Promoting good health is always an effective way to help the body function better.


Remain taking your pre-natal vitamins to ensure proper nutrition to the body as it tries to adjust to the changes occurring.
Try to get a full night's rest each night. The body is going through serious changes and it could use some help from you. Sleep is one of the best ways for the body to regenerate and heal itself.

, Speak to someone who specializes in the subject of breastfeeding, such as a lactation consultant. Lactation consultants can be found in the maternity wing of hospitals and sometimes at pediatric offices, as well as independently in the community. Ask around or look on the internet to find one.


Ask questions about your individual situation so that you can apply their valuable advice in the most accurate way possible.
Many centers offer educational seminars, meetings, or classes for breastfeeding mothers wishing to learn more about the weaning process. These professionals can often be your best resource for finding real life tips from those who have experience with breastfeeding and weaning.

, If you encounter other weaning problems that you aren't finding answers to, talk to other moms. Find out what their weaning process was like. You may be surprised to hear some of the tips that others have to offer. Many times, other moms can be an excellent source of information for nursing, weaning, and other parenting tips.


Write down what they say and refer to their tips throughout your own weaning process.

, Keep in mind that your baby may be having some difficulty adjusting to the change. Not only did she lose her mother’s breasts, she lost her comfort time with her mom. Find alternative ways to comfort and reassure your baby that do not involve the breast.Spend more time cuddling and showing affection, like extra hugs and kisses. This helps the baby get used to the reduced physical contact of weaning.
Spend more time one-on-one.
Ignore stimulants like TV, phone apps and communications, reading, pretty much anything that would divide your attention.
Work extra cuddling into your routine so that you don’t forget to do it, and so that you can have a specified time frame for ignoring your phone.

, Use distraction methods to prevent your baby from craving your breasts. Distraction can be accomplished easily and in many different ways. Anything that averts your baby’s attention from the breast is a successful distraction tactic.During a time that you would usually nurse, get your baby involved in a fun game or outing to help them forget about it.
Avoid sitting in spots that you usually nurse in.
Switch up the daily routine so that you aren’t doing things in the same order as when you were breastfeeding.
Rearrange the furniture in the room where you usually nurse to help the baby stop associating the room with nursing.
Get your partner involved in games and other activities to keep baby distracted during a feeding time, such as having your partner take the baby on an outing without you.
Don’t discourage the baby from forming an attachment to a blanket or stuffed animal, as this assists in the emotional adjustment of the weaning process.

, Babies and toddlers can be fussy and irritable during the weaning process because they are reacting to change. This time will pass, and you and your baby will move on to another chapter in your lives before you know it, and staying patient while both you and they make the transition is important.


Play with your baby or toddler, as this is their most important method of learning and experimenting, as well as communicating.When your baby gets into a crying jag while you are weaning and it’s not time to nurse, you can do things like take a personal timeout by placing baby in the crib or letting your partner take over for a few minutes, take a walk with the stroller, or quietly sing and pat the baby."

Nurse on the smaller breast first.,
Pump more on the smaller side.,
Take your baby to the doctor.,
Understand that it's medically fine.",How to Balance Breast Size During Breastfeeding1," Your baby's suckling is what triggers your body to produce milk.Also, babies tend to suckle harder when they first start feeding; therefore, if your baby suckles on the smaller breast first when you feed them, it can help trigger milk flow in that breast, helping to balance out the size of your breasts.


This solution only works if one breast is producing normally while the other is under producing. If one is overproducing, you may need to drain the milk off to prevent engorgement. Hand-express the overproducing breast for no more than 20 to 30 seconds.Another option is to nurse more often on the smaller side than the larger side.;
, Once your baby eats, try pumping for 10 minutes or so afterwards. In addition, you can try pumping just this side between the times you feed your baby., Sometimes, a preference for one side or the other means your baby doesn't feel right in a certain position. That discomfort could indicate an illness for your baby, such as an ear infection, or a treatable condition called torticollis. If you notice your baby always fusses unless they are on one side, take them to the doctor to have them checked out., That is, your breasts being different sizes doesn't indicate anything is wrong health-wise, unless other symptoms are present. In fact, many women produce different amounts of milk in each breast, leading to different sizes. You can even only feed on one breast if you need to do so, and your other breast will slowly regain the size it was before you got pregnant."

Trace a bib pattern.,
Find a bib pattern online.,
Choose fabric that is good for a baby.,
Pin the pattern to your first piece of fabric.,
Cut the fabric around your pattern.,
Repeat step two and three with your second piece of fabric.,
Pin both fabric pieces together.,
Sew around your bib, but leave a gap at the bottom.,
Turn the bib right side out.,
Iron the bib flat.,
Sew a topstitch all around the bib.,
Attach snaps with snap pliers.",How to Make a Baby Bib," Bib patterns are easy to make yourself. Make sure you draw neck straps about an inch wide to leave room for the snaps on each end. Baby bibs should be about:


10.75 inches from top to bottom.
8.5 inches from side to side.
11 inches around the neck.;
, As easy as bib patterns are to make yourself, you may want to use one already tested out. Find a free pattern download at http://www.lifewithmylittles.com/2015/07/best-and-easiest-bibs/., Pick something soft and absorbent, like terrycloth or one called minky fabric. Minky is extra soft for wiping around babies' mouth. Look for cotton fabric, since it won't irritate your babies skin and is hypoallergenic., You will need two pieces of fabric total, one for each side of the bib. Pin your pattern parallel to the perimeter of the fabric with sewing pins that are spaced about four inches apart., It’s best to use scissors designed for and used solely on fabric. Simply cut the fabric around your pinned pattern with sharp scissors, so it doesn’t fray., Use a complementary pattern for the fabric on the back of your bib. You can also use the same fabric you decided to use for the front., Take both pieces of cut fabric and lay them together so the right sides are facing each other. Place your pins parallel to the edges and about an inch from the perimeter. Place as many pins as you think is necessary to keep the fabric pieces securely together., Use a sewing machine to stitch around the pinned pieces of fabric. Place your stitch as close to the edges as possible. Do not sew all the way around the bib. Leave two inches of space open at the bottom.

, Grab ahold of the two inches you left open at the bottom, and turn the fabric right side out. This may take a bit of tugging around the neck straps, since they’re not as wide as the body of the bib., To make the next steps easier, it’s best to iron your bib flat. The two pieces of fabric may have a gap between them and look wrinkled, after you turn them right side out. Smooth them down with your hands first. Then use a properly heated iron to flatten out the fabric thoroughly.For cotton fabric use high heat.
For polyester-cotton blends use medium heat., Now that your bib is right side out, you can sew all the way around it. Sew a topstitch 1/8th of an inch from the edges with your sewing machine. It will make your bib look professional and put-together. Keep the following things in mind:Use an all-purpose thread.
Adjust the tension on your machine so it is not too loose or too tight.
Make your stitches 3 mm wide.
Don’t backstitch to secure the topstitch. Shorten the stitch length as much as possible towards the end instead., Plastic snaps are great to use on baby bibs, because they don’t weigh as much as metal ones and snap pliers will quickly and easily attach snaps to your baby bib. Make sure you attach snaps on opposite sides of each neck end.Place each snap a half inch from the tip of each neck end and center them.
Place the appropriate plastic stud on the fabric and use your pliers to secure it in place."

Keep small objects away from your crawling baby.,
Keep plastic bags away from your crawling baby.,
Never tie a dummy to your baby’s clothes.A dummy is a small rubber bit that fits in the mouth of crawling baby to help keep them quiet and enable them the opportunity to suckle.,
Keep curtain cords out of reach.,
Do not dress your crawling baby in stringy clothing or accessories.",How to Keep Your Crawling Baby Safe2," Do not use a baby crib that has slats spaced more than 2-3/8 inches (6 cm) apart. Otherwise, the crawling baby might get stuck between them and be strangled. Before placing your crawling baby in the crib, remove its bib. The cords might get caught on something and strangle your crawling baby. Finally, don’t hang diaper bags or purses on cribs, as the cords used to hang such objects might be used by the crawling baby to strangle itself.Don’t place pillows or duvets in your crawling baby’s crib. They might suffocate on them.
Make sure the crib isn't close to hanging cords from window blinds or curtains.

, Do not store jars of coins or stacks of buttons on or near the ground where your crawling baby might get into them. Your baby might get into these small objects and put them in their mouth. This could cause your baby to choke.Instead, place these small objects in sealed containers at an elevation where they are inaccessible to your baby. For example, you might place them in a locked cabinet or a cabinet that is several meters from the ground.
Other objects you should prevent your crawling baby from playing with include sewing needles, broken glass, nuts and bolts, pins and tacks, batteries, and small toy parts. Avoid toys that have thin or spindly bits on them that could break off and pose a choking hazard for your crawling baby.

, If you have plastic bags in your home, do not leave them lying about or give them to your baby to play with. If your crawling baby places these bags over their head, they might suffocate. Instead, place plastic bags in a locked cupboard that only you can access, or in an elevated cabinet that your baby cannot access., But tying the dummy to your crawling baby’s clothing or around their neck could lead to strangulation. For instance, if your crawling baby’s dummy gets caught on a piece of furniture while they are crawling about, they might end up getting strangled, which could produce brain damage or death.A dummy is sometimes also referred to as a pacifier, nuk, or binky.

, If you have low-hanging curtain or blind cords, tie the ends up with a twist tie at an elevation where the crawling baby cannot reach them. For instance, if your crawling baby can reach one meter above, the ends of your curtain or blind cords should be at least two meters above. This will prevent your crawling baby from getting strangled.Remember to place cribs and baby beds away from curtain and blind cords, too.If possible, replace your corded blinds with cordless ones.

, Never dress your crawling baby in anything that has a drawstring or forms a loop. For instance, necklaces, headbands, and the like should be off-limits when dressing your crawling baby. This will prevent your crawling baby from getting the looped or stringy wearable caught on something and being strangled."

Prevent your crawling baby from accessing cleaning supplies.,
Put locks or safety latches on cabinets and drawers.,
Keep your crawling baby away from smoke.,
Check the temperature of the bathwater before placing your crawling baby in it.,
Cover all electrical outlets.,
Keep alcohol, firearms, and any other hazardous items away from your baby.",How to Keep Your Crawling Baby Safe3," If your crawling baby strays too close to a hard, sharp piece of furniture, they might get a splinter or suffer a cut or other injury. Your crawling baby might jam their eye into a sharp corner and suffer a serious eye injury. Monitor your crawling baby as they crawl and keep them away from sharp corners and edges of furniture.Alternately, cover sharp, pointed edges of furniture with guards and padding (available at many home goods shops) or remove the sharp-cornered furniture altogether.

, If your crawling baby gets into medicine, they could overdose on the medicine and suffer serious harm. All medicine should be stored in locked cabinets that are out of your crawling baby’s reach.This includes vitamins and other supplements.


For instance, instead of placing your medicine in a ground-level cabinet or drawer beneath the sink where your baby can easily access them, place your medicine in a locked cabinet two or three meters above the ground that your crawling baby will not be able to access.
Most medicine – both prescriptions and over-the-counter medicines – have baby-proof packaging and caps that make them hard to access. Be sure to always replace the caps properly just in case your crawling baby does somehow crawl to these medications.

, Like medicine, cleaning supplies are very useful. But in the hands of a crawling baby, they can be dangerous and cause serious harm. Remove cleaning products from low-lying cabinets or shelves and place them in higher, out-of-reach places.Don't forget about dryer or dishwasher pods, as these have been associated with serious injuries to children.

, If you don’t have room to move your medicine and cleaning supplies to a higher elevation where they will be inaccessible to your crawling baby, install locks or safety latches on the low-lying cabinets instead. This is also a good idea for cabinets and drawers containing knives, firearms, matches, batteries, and other objects that your baby might choke on or use and get hurt., Don’t smoke around your crawling baby. Do not allow others to smoke around your crawling baby, either. If somebody wants to smoke near your baby, say, “I’m sorry, my baby cannot tolerate smoke in their small lungs. Please smoke outdoors.”Keep your baby far from people who smoke. Cigarette and cigar smoke clings to the clothes and your baby can inhale the smoke particles as secondhand smoke, which can be just as bad as regular smoke.
Have people remove their coats or change their clothing before being around the baby if they smoke outside.

, If the water is too hot, your crawling baby could be scalded.No crawling baby should be placed in bathwater greater than 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit). Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature of the tub water.If you’ve drawn a bath for your crawling baby that is in excess of the acceptable temperature, simply wait a few minutes for the water to cool to an acceptable level. Or, you can also add some cold water to the bath to cool it down quickly if it is too hot.
Never leave your crawling baby in the tub on their own. Crawling babies can drown easily in even two inches (5 cm) of water.

, It would be hard for your crawling baby to get electrocuted, but it is possible. To prevent such a misfortune from occurring, place an outlet cover over all your sockets. You can choose from sliding covers, swing-shut covers, or clear solid-piece covers., To protect your baby as they roam about and explore, make sure to put away any other potentially hazardous items.For example, you should keep all firearms locked in a safe and put alcohol up in a cabinet to keep it out of the reach of your baby. If something seems like it could pose a danger to your baby as they crawl around, put it up out of their reach."

Keep stairs and walkways clear of baby toys and clutter.,
Hold onto the handrails when going up and down stairs with your crawling baby.,
Reduce your crawling baby’s risk of suffocation while in a sling.,
Never carry hot food or drink while carrying your crawling baby.",How to Keep Your Crawling Baby Safe4," If your stairs and walkways are littered with toys and other debris that makes it hard to walk about without stepping on something, you might fall when carrying your crawling baby. Your crawling baby might get hurt if you fall while holding them.Assign each toy a special place. For instance, you might get a large chest and place all your crawling baby’s toys in it. Place the toy chest in a special play room. When your crawling baby wants to play, take them to the play room. When playtime is concluded, replace all the toys in the toy chest.
Obtain a lidless toy chest. Otherwise, your crawling baby might accidentally slam their head in the toy chest and get injured., Holding onto the handrails will give you a greater degree of balance while navigating stairs. If you do not use the handrail, you increase your likelihood for a fall that could hurt your crawling baby.Use a baby sling while navigating stairs so that you don’t have one hand on the handrail and one hand on the crawling baby.

, To prevent your baby from suffocating in a sling, keep your baby tight to you and in view. You should be able to see their face and they should be close enough to kiss. Support your baby’s back so that they don’t slump over into your chest., For instance, do not carry a mug of tasty hot chocolate in one hand while carrying your crawling baby in the other hand. You’ll have a hard time supporting the crawling baby, and the hot chocolate might slosh all over your baby, leading to burns.Instead of carrying hot food or drink along with your baby, first carry either your crawling baby or your food. Set it down. Then, pick up the one that you didn’t carry and set it down, too.
Similarly, do not carry hot food or drink near a crawling baby. You might trip on the crawling baby and your hot food or drink could spill on your crawling baby. This will hurt your crawling baby and it will start crying.

Pull the loose ends of the strip through the loop.,
Continue tying the strips to the cord in a similar fashion.,
Stick 5 clear, plastic hooks onto the chair.,
Wrap and tie the tutu around the high chair.",How to Make a High Chair Tutu2," You will need ½ yard (0.46 meters) of four different types of fabric. Cotton fabric works the best for this project. Choose colors and prints that go well together. It might be a good idea to have a solid color in there as well., How long you cut the strips depends on how long you want the tutu to be. The strips need to be twice the length you want them to be, plus an extra 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters).Use a sharp part of fabric scissors or a rotary cutter.

, The cord needs to be long enough to wrap around the table and back of the high chair, plus about 6 to 12 inches (15.24 to 30.48 centimeters). Choose a color that goes well with your fabric. White is always a safe bet, however., This will keep the fabric strips from slipping off. You can seal the ends of the cord with glue or tape to prevent fraying. If the cord is made out of a synthetic material, you can heat-seal it by holding it close to a flame.

, Fold a fabric strip in half with the right side facing out. Place it behind the cord, with the folded part sticking down, forming a loop.

, Gently tug on the loops to tighten the knot. Make sure that the right side of the fabric is facing out. Don't let the fabric twist too much.

, You can tie the strips on randomly or use a pattern. Keep going until you have the entire cord filled.Leave a few inches/centimeters at each end blank.

, Purchase a set of clear, plastic, self-adhesive hooks. Stick them around the table and back part of the high chair., Wrap the tutu around the highchair, allowing it to settle into the hooks. Tie the ends of the cord together so that the tutu doesn't fall off.

Flip the tutu over.,
Secure the tutu to the high chair with double-sided tape.",How to Make a High Chair Tutu3," You will need 1½-inch (38-millimeter) ribbon in four different colors. You will also need ⅝-inch (16-millimeter) ribbon in four different colors as well. You can use the same colors for both sets of ribbon.The ribbons can be solid-colored or patterned.
Use matching patterns to prevent clashing.

, This includes the table part and the back of the chair, plus a few inches/centimeters. ⅝-inch (16-millimeter) ribbon would work the best for this. This is your base ribbon.It is always better to cut the ribbon longer than you need to in case it ends up being too short in the end.

, Take the length of your ⅝-inch (16-millimeter) ribbon, and divide it by 1.5. Next, divide the answer by 4. The answer you get are how many ribbons you need to cut of each color. This includes the 1½-inch (38-millimeter) ribbon and the ⅝-inch (16-millimeter) ribbon., Measure down from the high chair's table to where you want the tutu to end. Cut the 1½-inch (38-millimeter) ribbons down to that length. Next, cut the ⅝-inch (16-millimeter) ribbons down 2 inches (5.08-centimeters) shorter than the 1½-inch (38-millimeter) ribbons., If you don't do this, the ribbon may fray. Light a candle, then hold the end of each ribbon close to it for a few seconds. This will melt the end of the ribbon and seal it, preventing it from fraying.

, Place a ⅝-inch (16-millimeter) ribbon on top of a 1½-inch (38-millimeter) ribbon. Make sure that it is centered and that the top edges of both ribbons are aligned. Secure both ribbons along the top edge with hot glue or fabric glue. Repeat this step for all of the ribbons.Make sure that the right side of each ribbon is facing out.
Don't glue down the entire length of the narrower ribbon. You want it to be loose so that it can flap around.
Mix and match different colors and patterns.

, Take the long, ⅝-inch (16-millimeter) base ribbon from before. Flip it over so that the back is facing you. Hot glue the layered ribbons to the base ribbon, right-side-down. Make sure that they are all facing in the same direction and that the top edges are aligned.


You can leave small gaps between the ribbons. ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) would be ideal.You should only be seeing the backs of the ribbons now.

, You should now have the base ribbon on top, and the layered ribbons hanging down from underneath it.

, Place small strips of double-sided tape around the table and back parts of the high chair. Wrap the tutu around the high chair. Press the ribbon into the tape so that it is secure.If the tape is not strong enough, use self-adhesive Velcro. You can remove any residue later using an adhesive remover, such as Goo Gone.
If you have excess base ribbon, overlap the two ends, and secure them with another strip of double-sided tape.

Watch for symptoms.,
Feed often.,
Prepare before breastfeeding.,
Breastfeed on the larger breast if it is engorged.,
Focus on latching.,
Pump only when needed.,
Use cold to help with the tenderness.,
Pick a good bra.,
Know when to call the doctor.",How to Balance Breast Size During Breastfeeding2," Your breasts will become larger after you give birth; however, sometimes you may develop engorgement, where your breasts become hard and swollen because milk is getting blocked up inside. Symptoms can include your breast being tender and warm or a throbbing sensation. You might also notice your nipple flattening out or that you are running a light fever (under 100.4°F or 38°C).If not treated, you can develop a plugged duct, which will cause your breasts to be uneven, as well as being a problem medically., One way to help treat engorgement is to feed often. That means letting your baby eat when they want and as long as they want, often eight to 12 times a day.That also means feeding at least every four hours; even if your baby is asleep, you should wake them up to feed., To make breastfeeding easier, try using a warm compress before you feed. Apply light heat for three minutes.Another option is gently massaging your breast so that it releases milk.You can also gently massage your breast while your baby is suckling., Once your breast becomes engorged, you should try to use that breast more often. When one breast is underperforming and the other one is normal, it's fine to use the smaller one more often to stimulate milk; however, when one is engorged, you need to focus more on it to help release some of the build of up milk, which is causing the problem.It's common for just one breast to become engorged, rather than both at the same time.

, If your baby isn't latching on well, you may need to work with a specialist (such as a lactation consultant or your doctor) to help with latching. If the baby is not latching, they may not be getting enough milk.One way to help your baby latch properly is to bring their head up underneath your breast, letting their chin be closest to your breast. Try to get them to touch your breast with their bottom lip on the far bottom side of your areola. That way, they can pull in enough of your breast, situating your nipple towards the back of their mouth., That is, if you're feeding your baby regularly (every couple of hours), you don't need to pump unless your breast becomes hard, and your baby is not ready to eat. If you pump too much, you'll encourage your body to produce more milk, which can lead to engorgement for long periods of time. Also, keep your pumping sessions to about two to three minutes on low.If you've returned to work and need to pump, try to do it when you would normally feed your baby to keep on the same schedule; make sure you are pumping at least in four-hour increments., When you're not feeding, you can apply cold to your breasts to help ease the pain. Use an ice pack covered in a cloth. You can use it directly before or after feeding., If your bra fits well, it can help with engorgement. Make sure it is not too tight. In addition, make sure it supports your breasts, but skip ones with underwire.If a bra is too tight, it can contribute to engorgement by cutting off the flow., If you notice that your breasts have become hard, especially if they are painful, it's time to talk to your doctor. You should also give them a call if your child seems to be having trouble with breastfeeding. Finally, if you are running a fever over 100.4°F (38 °C) or notice the skin of your breast has become red, you may want to call.You will notice some hardness in the first few days of breastfeeding, which is normal, but if you suddenly develop hardness with pain in your breasts, it's time to call the doctor.

Watch for symptoms.,
Feed on the plugged side.,
Apply a warm compress.,
Massage your breasts.,
Help your baby latch.,
Watch for mastitis.",How to Balance Breast Size During Breastfeeding3," When an engorged breast becomes completely blocked, it's called a plugged or clogged duct. Essentially, the milk duct becomes clogged, not allowing as much milk to come through.You will notice a lump in your breast that is painful; usually, this condition isn't accompanied by a fever.Most of the time, your breast will be partially blocked, not fully blocked; however, sometimes, you may have skin cells grow over the end of your nipple, which you'll be able to see as a small white dot., Just as with engorged breasts, it is important to focus more on this side while the breast is plugged. Doing so can help release the clog.Even if your breast is truly blocked, your baby feeding can help. If they don't pull off the small bit of skin cells, you can use a washcloth or even your fingernail to gently remove it., Use a warm compress to help relieve the pain. It can also help release the clog.Doing so right before you feed can make your milk come faster., Massaging can also help plugged ducts. Begin with where you find a sore spot, rubbing in the direction of your nipple. This motion can help ease pain as well as help your milk to flow., Latching is important in getting milk to flow well; therefore, if your baby isn't latching properly, your milk may not be flowing fast enough. In addition, your baby may not be eating enough., If you develop a fever (101°F 38.3°C or higher) or chills, you likely have mastitis instead of just a plugged duct. You may also just feel bad all over, in addition to the symptoms you feel because of the plugged duct. You might also notice your skin turn red on your breast (sometimes in a wedge shape) or a burning sensation, especially while feeding. If you notice these symptoms, definitely call your doctor.Mastitis is essentially an infection in your breast that sometimes develops after a plugged duct."

Try a padded breastfeeding bra.,
Use a pad on the smaller side.,
Fit your bra to the larger breast.",How to Balance Breast Size During Breastfeeding4," Most nursing bras have some extra padding to absorb any extra flow. Nonetheless, make sure you pick one that is molded or that has padding. If it has both, even better. Padding and molding will help hide the unevenness of your breasts., You can either buy bra pads or pick a bra that has removable pads. Don't use one on the larger side, but insert it on the smaller side. The pad will make your breasts look more even., If you need to buy a new bra due to unevenness, pick one that fits the larger breast. You don't want to restrain the larger breast by purchasing a bra that is too small."

Achieve lactation longevity.",How to Become a Wet Nurse," In order to become a wet nurse, you must first induce lactation. You can do so either with or without becoming pregnant. The next two parts cover are the two methods you can choose to initiate lactation.;
, Decide carefully on which method of fertilization you want. Artificial insemination is becoming more common and has a high success rate. However, if you want to get pregnant the old fashioned way, all you need to do is eliminate birth control from your regime and have unprotected sex when you are most fertile.


Buy pregnancy tests in bulk, as you will need to use one five to six days after you have sex. It is also useful to use more than one pregnancy test to ensure that you are not getting any false positives.

, They can help you choose the method of fertilization best suited to your health and lifestyle. When you see your doctor, ask her or him if it would be beneficial for you to start taking prenatal vitamins prior to becoming pregnant.

, Having sex right before you ovulate increases your chances of getting pregnant. You can determine your ovulation patterns by noticing changes within your body during that time. Normally your body temperature goes up by a few degrees when you ovulate, so keep a thermometer handy. Your vaginal discharge also tells you a lot about your fertility. When is is clear and more fluid like, you are more fertile than when it is a dry, milky white.

,, During pregnancy, hormonal changes occur within the body and you need to be ready for them. Your breasts will start to feel swollen, tender, and you may not fit into your normal bra size. Your nipples may also become swollen, puckered, or darker. Little bumps that secrete oils called Montgomery’s tubercles may also appear on the nipples. These are signs that the body is getting ready to produce milk and may start in the first trimester.

, It is important to pump out the colostrum from your breasts before you start marketing yourself as a wet nurse; unless, of course, your clients want you to breastfeed their children with the excess fats, proteins, and antibodies found in your colostrum. Pumping gets the breasts accustomed to producing milk, thus facilitating the feeding process for your little clients.

, Within two days after giving birth, your body ramps up production of hormones which increase lactation longevity. The clients you had during pregnancy will find your services to be even more useful now. You may even feel as if you have super powers, as your mammary glands are now equipped with tense muscles that make your milk squirt as far as 10 feet!

, Side effects may include and are not limited to swollen/sore nipples, enlarged breasts and frequent mood swings. Side effects occur due to the hormone supplements you will take for the lactation process to occur that signal the body to believe that it is pregnant.

, Lactation specialists are best equipped to provide the necessary prescription to receive pills, supplements or other medications. It is important to obtain a medical examination record to show your customers that you have a drug- and alcohol-free lifestyle.

, Domperidone is the most common hormone supplement purposed with inducing lactation. Consult a doctor prior to taking any supplements, as they can prescribe the supplements most appropriate to your health and lifestyle. However, pharmacies within the US do sell this hormone without a prescription. However, it is not advised that you take any pills without a doctor’s prescription.

, Follow the prescription instructions exactly, as any minor deviation can slow the process of inducing of lactation. Pay attention to the side effects that come along with taking certain hormones and monitor these side effects to ensure that you are not having any allergic reactions.

, This will help with the transition of lactation. Six months before you wish to begin breastfeeding, stop taking estrogen because this action tricks the body into thinking you have given birth (How to Lactate) and are now ready to produce larger quantities of milk.

, Breast pumps can be found in baby department stores and retail stores that sell a wide range of products. Using a breast pump to initiate lactation provides consistent stimulation to the nipple. Use the breast pump three times a day for 15 to 20 minutes. Start with a low suction, allowing the nipples to adjust to the sucking feeling. Lactation may not occur immediately. Improve your chances of lactating sooner by taking your hormones consistently and practicing nipple stimulation daily.

, With this labor intensive process, you begin massaging one breast with both hands. It is important to massage your entire breast, focusing especially on the nipple. Stimulate yours nipples in a fashion similar to that of a suckling infant. Massage your breasts 10 to 16 times a day. When you begin to feel engorged with milk, start bending forward while doing your daily massages, allowing the milk to flow downwards and excrete from the nipple. If you do not see any lactation within two months, it is best to resolve to the breast pump method.

, Your clients will likely want to see your medical history and you will look very professional if you have copies of it. For more details on the things you should be tested for, visit mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sexually-transmitted-diseases-stds/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20034128.

, The health of your little clients depends on your cleanliness. Ensure that you sanitize your nipples in between clients. It is recommended that you only breastfeed children who do not have teeth, as bites can cause skin breakage and will put you out of commission until they heal. If you are bitten, visit a doctor immediately to get the all clear and also let your clients know about the incident in writing of your being bitten prior to breastfeeding their child.

, Ensure that the supplements you take are safe for both you and the infants you will be breastfeeding. Organic supplements may not last as long as artificial ones and may be more expensive, but they are usually safer and are highly recommended. You can refer to motherlove.com’s homepage for more information on taking organic supplements.

, You do not want to deal with the discomfort of a bra that is too big or too small during or after breastfeeding. Go to a nearby maternity store and have them measure your bust to ensure that you get the right cup size. Also get a tightly knit cup size to provide ample support for your breasts.

, You can also get a bra that unlatches from the front.

, Avoid any lace or silky material that can be easily soiled. Underwire bras may result in irritation of the breasts as the wire may push against the breast tissue and create discomfort.

, Washing your bras with hot water and mild laundry detergent is extremely effective. Sanitizing them with chemicals is not recommended because often these chemicals are too harsh and may harm your little clients upon contact.

, Paperwork is necessary for this exchange of bodily fluid. You must always enforce the safety of the child as well of yourself while wet nursing. Have a lawyer draw up a contract detailing exactly what services you will provide to your little clients and have the lawyer include a consent form that must be signed by the parent with an unbiased witness present.

, A contract also helps to avoid any awkwardness that may accompany this kind of transaction, as it includes the risks, benefits, compensation, binding period (how long you will provide these services), and consent of both parties in writing.

, You can start marketing yourself as a wet nurse on freelance websites like Craigslist. If you prefer not to have bodily contact with your clients however, consider opting for freezing and selling your milk to local hospitals or even online (just make sure the seal is airtight).

, Some mothers are not able to produce milk for their infants, or should not because they have harmful substances in their systems. Therefore, making yourself known to local hospitals and OB/GYNs as a wet nurse is a good way to start marketing because hospitals recommend breastfeeding instead of artificial feeding and would likely make use of your services.

, A good place to start marketing during your pregnancy is La Leche League, an organization dedicated to providing support and education to breastfeeding women. They hold meetings regularly and you could easily find a client there! There are also companies like Certified Household Staffing, based in Los Angeles, who act as middlemen and connect wet nurses to employers.

, Feeling sore is normal. For the first few days of breastfeeding, you may feel discomfort. This pain can be alleviated by gently rubbing ice on your nipples or applying organic, paraben-free ointment. Start wet nursing two to three children a day, slowly adding clients as you grow comfortable.

, While breastfeeding, women must stay hydrated to continue maximizing their milk volume. Drink five glasses of water per infant, per hour. Another way to balance your liquids is to consume raw vegetables, fruits, and drink herbal teas. Avoid heavily salted foods and caffeinated beverages, like coffee and soda.

, Consume specific foods like oatmeal, garlic, carrots and nuts. These are nutritional foods that several sources claim increase lactation. Include fenugreek and fennel seeds in your diet to increase milk production. Consider using go-lacta pills or powder, which can be found at www.golacta.com.

, Stay stress free. Getting into the right mindset about lactation will increase the chances of milk production. Maintain a healthy lifestyle mentally and physically. Babies sense stress and fatigue, so do not bring such emotional states into the feeding environment. If you feel stress or anxiety, consider yoga or meditation classes.

, Monitor your milk production. Keep in mind that your revenue directly correlates to your client base. Whether you chose to become pregnant or not to induce lactation, you must still continue to breastfeed in order to continue producing milk.

, Breastfeed indefinitely, if you choose to. Judith Waterford, a renowned wet nurse in the early 1800s, continued to produce milk until she was on her deathbed at 81 years old!Continue to breastfeed every day, and continue to pump milk on your days off.

Separate the cap, nipple collar, nipple, vent insert, vent reservoir, travel disc, and any insert components from the bottle so you can clean each part.If you’re not sure how to take apart your particular Dr. Brown’s bottle or how many parts that your bottle has, consult the manufacturer’s insert and instructions.;
, The easiest place to clean the bottle by hand is in the kitchen sink. Make sure that the sink is clean, and then fill it with hot water from the tap. Squirt some dishwashing liquid into the sink and agitate the water slightly to create a hot, soapy solution.If you prefer, you can fill a bucket or basin with the soapy water to clean the bottle.

, Once the sink is full of hot, soapy water, place the bottle pieces into the mixture. Allow the bottle to sit in the water for 15 to 30 minutes., After you’ve allowed the bottle pieces to soak in the hot, soapy water for several minutes, use a small brush to thoroughly scrub all of the pieces. Pay special attention to any holes, grooves, or other nooks and crannies to ensure that the bottle is completely clean.Many Dr. Brown’s bottles come with at least one brush for cleaning. You can also purchase brush sets from the brand that feature brushes in different sizes to make scrubbing all of the different components easier.

, After you’ve finished scrubbing all of the bottle components, drain the soapy water out of the sink. Turn on the faucet and rinse the pieces with hot water to ensure that there is no dirt or soapy residue remaining.When rinsing the bottle parts, taking care to ensure that the nipple hole is completely clean and clear.

, After washing the bottle, it’s important to allow the pieces to dry completely before putting it back together so mold doesn’t grow. Set the pieces out a clean towel or in a drying rack, and allow them to dry overnight.Dr. Brown’s sells a drying rack designed specifically for their bottles and components, which make it very easy to separate the pieces as they dry.

Acquire a baby scale.,
Make sure the scale is set to 0.,
Weigh the baby.",How to Weigh a Baby1," Look for a scale that is sturdy and accurate. There should be a tray or indentation in which your baby can lay safely. Additionally, there should be no sharp or rough parts that could hurt your baby. Look for a scale that can hold up to 40 lbs (approximately 18 kg).Make sure the scale can read differences of as little as 10 grams.Scales are available for purchase online for around $50.
Baby scales can be digital, colorful, utilitarian, and can include accessories like a length measuring arm.
In some regions, you can rent a baby scale. This is a practical option for people with budget or space limitations.;
, Whether a digital or analog scale, be sure the reading is 0 when there is nothing on it. If you plan to put the baby on top of a blanket, you can null this weight on a digital scale. To do so, first place the blanket on the scale. Once its weight registers, press the tare key. This will void that weight.

, Set the baby on the scale, preferably naked. Keep one hand hovering over, but not on, the baby’s chest. You want to be able to catch the baby if he slips. Read his weight. Record the baby’s weight in a notebook. Keep track of weight gain or loss. As weight fluctuation happens often, it is best to weigh your baby every two weeks to measure longer term gains or losses.Don't worry too much about short-term weight gains or losses, unless your child seems ill or is having feeding problems. In that case, check with your doctor.
If the weather is too cold, weigh your child’s clothes separately and then dress your child for the weigh-in. Subtract the weight of the clothes from the weight shown on the scale.
Set the scale on a sturdy, flat surface. Your dining room table would work as would a wood or linoleum floor.

Take the bottle apart.,
Place the small parts in a basket.,
Arrange the bottle on the top shelf.,
Run the dishwasher as usual.,
Dry the bottle before reassembling.",How to Clean Dr Brown Bottles2," Before placing a Dr. Brown’s bottle in the dishwasher, you must disassemble it so all of the parts are cleaned. Separate the bottle, cap, nipple collar, nipple, vent insert, vent reservoir, travel disc, and any other insert components., When you’re washing the bottle in a dishwasher, you don’t want any of the parts to fall to the bottom of the machine where the heat may damage them. Set the small parts, such as the cap, nipple collar, nipple, vent insert, vent reservoir, travel disc, and any other insert components into the dishwasher’s basket so they’ll stay put when you run the cycle.Dr. Brown’s sells a dishwashing basket if your dishwasher doesn’t have one. It has space to arrange the cap, nipple collar, nipple, vent insert, vent reservoir, travel disc, and any other insert components for washing in the dishwasher.
Whatever basket you use for the smaller components, make sure that you place it in the top shelf of the dishwasher.

, After you’ve added the smaller pieces to the basket, place the bottle itself on the top shelf of the dishwasher. You don’t want to put in the bottom shelf because it may fall out during the cycle and become damaged., Once the bottle and all of the pieces are secure in the dishwasher, add your usual detergent and turn it on. You can use whatever cycle that you usually use, but the sanitizer cycle can be helpful when washing bottles.It’s a good idea to set your dishwasher to run a dry cycle after the washing cycle is complete. That will allow the bottle and its components to be steam cleaned as well.

, The bottle and its parts will be mostly dry when the dishwasher cycle is finished. However, there may be some condensation and residual moisture on the components. Wipe the bottle and other pieces with a clean towel to ensure that they’re thoroughly dry before reassembling it.To be sure that the bottle is completely dry before putting it back together, you may want to leave the pieces out to air dry for several hours before reassembling it.

Dissemble the bottle and wash. Before sterilizing your Dr. Brown’s bottle, take it apart to break it down into the individual components, such as the bottle, cap, nipple collar, nipple, vent insert, vent reservoir, travel disc, and any other insert components.,
Fill a pot with water.,
Bring the water to a boil.,
Soak the bottle parts for several minutes.,
Turn off the heat and allow the water to cool.,
Remove the bottle pieces and allow the pieces to dry.",How to Clean Dr Brown Bottles3," Next, wash the pieces with your prefered method.Even if you are sanitizing a new bottle, you should wash it first.

, To sterilize the bottle, you’ll need a medium or large pot. Add enough water to the pot to cover the bottle and all of its components when it is either lying on its side or standing up.While you can leave the bottle and its components in the pot while you’re adding the water to determine the appropriate level, be sure to take them out before you place the pot on the stove.

, Once the pot is filled with water, set it on the stove top. Heat the water on medium-high until it comes to a boil, which should take 7 to 10 minutes., When the water is boiling, carefully add the bottle and its parts to the pot. Let the soak in the boiling water for 5 minutes to fully sanitize them.Be very careful when placing the bottle and parts into the boiling water because the water and steam can easily burn your skin. You may want to use a pair of tongs to place them in the water.

, After the bottle and parts have boiled in the water for 5 minutes, shut off the heat. Remove the pot from the stove, and let the water cool, which should take 15 to 30 minutes., When the water is cool, lift the bottle out pieces out of the water. Set them down on a clean towel and allow them to dry completely for several hours or overnight.For best results, use clean tongs to lift the bottle and parts out of the water. If you are using your hands, make sure that they are freshly washed.
Pat the bottle and parts dry as best you can with a clean towel before setting them out to dry.

Weigh yourself.,
Pick up your child.,
Weigh yourself and your baby.",How to Weigh a Baby2," Stand on the scale. Register your weight. Write it down. Ideally, use a scale that can measure in tenths of a pound. This method is less precise than a baby scale but is cost effective.


1/10 of a pound is 45.36 grams or 1.6 oz

, Preferably hold your child while she is naked. This will ensure a more accurate reading. If you prefer, you can hold your child’s clothes while you weigh yourself so that only the child’s body weight is added when you weigh yourself with a dressed child.

, Register the weight. Write it down. Subtract your single weight from your combined weight. The result is your baby’s weight.


For example: if you alone weigh 140 lbs. and you and the baby weight 149.8 lbs., then your baby weighs 9.8 lbs. on his own.

Schedule a visit.,
Have the medical professional weigh your baby.,
Keep attending check-ups.",How to Weigh a Baby3," Call your doctor. Ask whether you can drop in to use her scale. Some offices allow this. Others require you to have an appointment.

, Your doctor or a nurse will weigh your child on a medical baby scale. She will note the baby’s weight in his chart. All babies are weighed at birth. Medical professionals also will weigh your baby again during his first week. At period check-ups throughout your baby’s early years, your child will be weighed again.Medical baby scales are often extremely accurate and more expensive than home scales. Their designs can be similar to home scales with contoured dips. Some doctor’s offices might have car seat-like baby scales as well.

, As your child ages, it is important that in addition to home weigh-ins, that you bring her to the doctor. The doctor will have advice and feedback on your child’s weight gain or loss.


The doctor might suggest dietary changes, such as feeding more or less or feeding different foods or liquids.

Despite prevalent attitudes today, there's no shame in bottle-nursing.,
Hold your baby in the same positions you would if you were nursing him/her.,
Take your time and get comfortable with pillows or a Boppy, just as you would if you were nursing.,
Be sure to always hold the bottle at the right angle - every bottle system is different, so follow the instructions that come with the bottles.

,
Don't rush things.,
A good latch is just as important for bottle-feeding as it is for breastfeeding.,
Each baby is unique and has his/her own suckling technique.,
Gaze into your baby's eyes, talk to him/her, and sing to him/her.,
Always offer formula at near-body temperature.,
DO NOT BOTTLE-PROP.,
When you bottle-feed in public, try the same things that breastfeeding mothers do: Find a quiet place, get comfortable, and even cover your shoulder and the baby with a blanket so they can have a nice, cozy, non-distracting environment to eat in.

,
If you feel discouraged, remind yourself why you are doing this: To recreate the nursing experience for both you and your baby.

",How to Bottle Nurse a Baby," Choosing whether to breastfeed or bottle-nurse is a personal decision and no one should be able to sway you from your decision. Stay positive about your decision to bottle nurse.;
, Get skin-to-skin as much as possible, as often as possible. Your baby needs to benefit from your warm skin, your breathing and your heartbeat. Be sure to include extra snuggling and skin-to-skin contact throughout the day when you're not feeding the baby.

, You can even prop a small baby comfortably on a pillow so he/she is facing you, and then you have a free hand to touch her. Let him/her play with your hands, your fingers, your face. Gently discourage him/her from playing with the hard, plastic bottle by offering your soft, warm skin.

,, Let the baby eat at his/her own pace. Sometimes you have to take the nipple out a bit and let the baby ""catch up"" on swallowing, much like during breastfeeding let-down. Don't force-feed the baby. He/she will start and stop on their own. Be patient. Your baby will let you know when he/she is done.

, Breastfed babies develop their jaw, tongue and facial muscles and coordination through suckling, so ensure your bottle-fed baby has a good latch. His/her lips should be averted (rolled outwards), and touching the nipple all the way around so no air gets in his/her mouth. Look at pictures of breastfeeding latches to learn more.

, You may need to go through several styles of bottles and nipples before you find the one that's right for your baby. Pay attention to your baby's comfort level during eating - is it too slow? Too fast? Is the nipple too wide or too narrow? Is the baby taking in too much air (causing painful gas and fussiness)? Are they just chewing on the nipple and not able to suck effectively? (Also, remember your baby's suckling style will change as he/she grows.)

, Rock in a rocking chair or glider. Curl up in bed. Dim the lights, shut out distractions, and focus entirely on your baby - because the bottle is between you and your baby, you'll need to go the extra mile to get close to the breastfeeding experience.

, Some babies will take a room-temperature or cold bottle, but remember, with bottle-feeding you need to compensate for having that bottle between you and your baby.

, EVER. It is unsafe. Also, because you have the bottle between you and your baby, you can compensate for any lack of physical bonding by dedicating yourself to bottle-nursing with love. Bottle-propping leads to feeding problems, possible choking, and dental problems, in addition to possibly creating detachment in both parent and baby.

Buy extra nipples.",How to Choose Bottles for Your Baby," Plastic bottles are the most commonly bought bottle type because they are affordable, lightweight, strong.


Although there was previously some debate over the safety of using plastic baby bottles because of their chemical composition, in 2012 the US Food and Drug Administration or FDA officially banned the use of BPA or Bisphenol A in the manufacture of plastic baby products.
Nowadays, plastic baby bottles are considered safe and are used by almost every parent due their convenience and affordability.;
, One disadvantage of plastic baby bottles is that when they are repeatedly cleaned in the dishwasher or in hot soapy water there is a danger of chemical leaching.


Therefore, parents are advised to replace plastic bottles when they have been used for a long period of time (usually within one year). You will also need to replace plastic bottles as soon as they become cracked or chipped.
So, should you avoid plastic altogether? Experts say no, as plastic bottles also have ecological advantages in that they are recyclable and lightweight and they have low energy consumption.

, Rather than avoiding plastic altogether, just be sure to read the label and choose the plastic product carefully. According to the non-profit organization Healthy Child Healthy World, the most common recyclable plastics that are safe to use for food are plastics #2, #4, #5 and #7, if the label says it is a bio-based plastic like polylactic acid., To prevent any issues of chemical leakage, avoid cleaning plastic bottles in the dishwasher and do not microwave plastic bottles. Instead, just hand wash plastic bottles in warm soapy water and rinse thoroughly after the initial sterilization process.

, Plastic bottles are generally easy to use and there is no added fear of them shattering if you or your baby accidentally drop it.


A variety of plastic bottles have narrow or wide mouth openings, so choose a bottle that has a wide mouth-opening in order to transfer breast milk or formula easily.
Make sure to choose a bottle with a sturdy design that has measurement markings that you can easily read, so you will know exactly how much you are feeding your baby.

, Plastic bottles should have zero leak potential in them. It would be such a waste to see milk that has leaked out of the bottle, be it breast milk or formula, because milk is precious.


Choose a bottle that is easy to assemble both when you are static and when you are mobile. You never know when you will have to assemble a bottle of milk while you are walking, in a moving vehicle, inside an elevator – the possibilities are endless.
Keep in mind that the more pieces a plastic bottle has, the more potential it has for leakage.

, A basic plastic baby bottle will include a bottle, a screw cap or nipple ring, a nipple and the nipple cover.


Make sure that the nipple cap or cover audibly “snaps” when you cover the nipple, especially if you are on the go. You wouldn’t want to discover the milk you prepared for your baby has leaked out of the bottle when traveling because the cap was not put on tightly enough.
Apart from that audible “snap” on cover, make sure to inspect the cap before buying to see if it has an indentation inside that will fit the tip of the nipple when covered. This feature ensures that the nipple hole is “plugged”, which prevents further leakage.

, With proper care and attention, glass bottles are more durable and long-lasting than plastic bottles. They are also dishwasher safe and there is no fear of chemical leaching.


However, even though glass products are sold with a durable rubber coating to protect the glass inside, there’s always a chance of it chipping or breaking, making it virtually useless.
You also have to think about whether your baby is ready to grasp a glass bottle because they are somewhat heavier than a plastic bottle.

, If you are going to use a glass bottle for your baby, make sure that you are also available to hold the bottle properly in place while your baby is feeding, so they don't get too tired of holding it and drop it.


When your baby is using a glass bottle, make sure that you or another responsible adult is present so if the bottle drops and shatters, your baby will be prevented from stepping on the broken glass.
In addition, you should regularly inspect the for any chips or cracks because these present a leaking hazard, especially if you are on the go.

, Some disposable bottles can be handy to have around for those quick “need to go now” moments, especially if you do not have any plastic or glass bottles clean or available for use at that time.


Disposable baby bottles come in different designs, but the basic concept is to have a special sterilized liner inside the bottle which you can transfer breastmilk or formula into. Once baby is finished feeding, you just dispose of the liner and replace it with a new one for the next feeding.
The downside to disposable bottles is that they are costly, since you have to keep purchasing new liners for the bottles when re-using. Additionally, since the disposable inserts are made of a soft plastic material, it can be a challenge to transfer pumped breast-milk or formula into the disposable inserts while you are on the go.

, Stainless steel baby bottles are lightweight, durable, eco-friendly, contain no harmful plastic chemicals. Some manufacturers even produce bottles that “grow” with the baby, converting the baby bottle into a sippy cup or a container for cereal later on.There is also no danger of these bottles shattering when you or the baby accidentally drop them. Additionally, you do not need to think of replacing the bottle after prolonged use because there are no chemicals that will accidentally leach into the milk, even after repeated heating in the dishwasher.
The only con when it comes to stainless steel baby bottles is that they are more expensive than plastic and glass bottles.

, The most commonly used nipples for baby bottles are clear silicone nipples because they are firmer and more durable than other nipple types.


Since silicone nipples are firmer, they provide a good solid latch on your baby’s mouth and coupled with a wide base, they can mimic a mother’s breast. This way, your baby won’t gag, smack or leak a lot of precious milk from the corners of her mouth.
Basically, a nipple should have a large, wide base because this will help your baby to latch on properly. A narrow base may present a choking hazard as the base can get in your baby’s mouth during feeding, especially if your baby’s suction is strong and powerful.

, Some manufacturers use latex because it is softer than silicone, however latex presents an allergy hazard more than silicone so some babies might get an allergic reaction to it.


Latex nipples also tend to tear more easily, which presents a choking hazard and means you will have to replace the nipples more frequently, which can be costly.

, When buying nipples, make sure to buy nipples for the bottle they were designed to be used for (so buy within the same brand). When nipples and bottles are mixed and matched, there is always greater potential for leakage because the parts will not fit together perfectly.


Once you buy the nipples, sterilize them and any other accessories according to the manufacturer’s directions - this is the only time you will need to sterilize them. You just have to wash the nipples in warm soapy water after every use.
Make sure to regularly check the nipples for any tears, especially if your baby has started teething. She will usually bite the nipples and play with them after feeding and if there is a tear on the nipple, this presents a choking hazard, so you need to replace it right away.

, Some manufacturers just have the basic bottle, nipple, nipple ring and cover as the parts of the baby bottle, but others also contain air vents and special valves, which are intended to prevent colic.


Bottle manufacturers have included air vents in their nipples to prevent air bubbles from being accidentally ingested by the infant, as this is believed to be the cause of colic.
If after your research you find that your baby is not colicky, you can do without nipples that have special vents and valves, but if you find that your baby will benefit in the long run from using such a product, then by all means, this is what you should consider buying.
The disadvantage of these nipples is that since the air vents and valves are small, they are difficult to clean and maintain; there’s also the danger of them falling down the drain when being washed.

, If you end up with these types of bottles, purchase a stainless steel basin that you will use only for cleaning them so that the small parts included in the set won’t be in any danger of falling down the drain during washing.


Purchase and use a cleaning brush set with a big brush and small brush so that you have one for each part of the bottle set. The big brush will be used to clean the whole bottle, and the small brush will be used to clean the nipple, nipple ring, valves and air vents.
Make sure to swoop your hand through the basin before throwing the water into the sink to check if there are other small parts left inside that you just can’t see because of the soap bubbles.

, Try each type of bottle first before buying several of them. See how your baby responds to the bottle and consider whether the bottle fits his needs.


Once you have identified the bottle that works best for your baby, you can start buying more of the same kind.
Make sure that the bottles are BPA-free, as this chemical has been linked to health problems.

, If you are not breastfeeding and your baby is mostly bottle-fed, it is recommended that you buy around 6 to 12 bottles. This number may need to be increased depending on your baby’s consumption.


On the other hand, if you are breastfeeding, you will still need to have at least two bottles as you will need them whenever you express your milk and for storage.

, Bottle nipples come in different shapes, sizes, materials, and flow levels. It is important to know the appropriate flow for your baby to prevent him from struggling while feeding or from not getting enough food.


There are three types of nipple flow: soft, medium, and fast flow. Soft-flow nipples are used by newborns from ages 0-3 months. Medium-flow nipples are used by babies over 3 months of age as they may require more milk due to their increased sucking ability.
Fast flow nipples are used by babies who are ready and can cope up with the speedy milk flow.

, You need to have more nipples than bottles, as you will need to change the nipples more regularly when they become worn out or the baby chews a hole in them.

This situation cannot be avoided as your baby might be teething. However, you can reduce the tendency of your baby to chew on the nipple by giving him a teething ring to use instead.

Put the nebulizer on the baby.,
Supervise the baby as he inhales the complete dose.,
Clean the nebulizer as directed by the instructions and the doctor.,
Stay with your baby while the nebulizer is on.,
Let the child personalize the nebulizer if he is old enough.,
Don’t put the nebulizer on a crying baby.",How to Use an Infant Nebulizer," An infant will inhale the medication in a mist provided by the mask. Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions and any additional advice provided by your child’s doctor. Study pictures or watch a training video to learn how best to use the nebulizer. Most nebulizers are easy to set up. Wash your hands thoroughly before handling the nebulizer.Plug in the air compressor to an electrical outlet.
Put the correct dosage of medication into the medicine cup.
Connect the various parts by attaching the air hose to the nebulizer and the machine. Then attach the mask to the nebulizer cup.
Put the mask over the baby’s nose and mouth. It may have an elastic strap that you can use to hold it in place.;
, This usually takes about five to 10 minutes. The baby should breathe normally.Hold the baby sitting upright in your lap and make sure the mask is snug against the baby’s face. If there is space between the mask and the baby, the mist will leak out and the baby will not get the whole dose.
As the mist slows down, flick the medicine cup with your finger to make sure the last few droplets of medication are nebulized and inhaled.

, It is important to keep the nebulizer clean to prevent your child from inhaling germs. This could cause an infection.Clean the pieces quickly after each usage. This should include taking the pieces apart and rinsing all of them, except the air hose, in warm water. The mask should be washed with warm water and soap. Shake some of the water off, then let the pieces to air dry. If the tubing is damp, run air through it with the compressor for a few minutes until it is dry.
Do a thorough cleaning three times per week when you are using the machine regularly. Soak the pieces in warm soapy water for 20 minutes. Rinse them, then soak them in a 1:4 solution of white vinegar and water for another 20 minutes. Rinse them, then let them air dry.
Some nebulizers can be disinfected by boiling. Check the manufacturer’s instructions to make sure yours can withstand it. If so, you can boil it for 10 minutes.Wipe dust off the machine with a damp cloth once a week and check the air filter once per month. The nebulizer, but not the air compressor, should be replaced every three to six months.

, You can make it a relaxed part of your daily routine by doing it at the same time each day. In addition, you can make the time as enjoyable as possible by:Reading to the baby
Singing
Playing with special toys
Putting on her favorite video
Praising your child for having done a good job inhaling the medication

, This will give the child a sense of ownership over the nebulizer and make it seem less scary.Some children put stickers on the compressor.
Your child can even pick out a mask that he likes. Possibilities include an elephant mask, a turtle mask, or a fish mask. You can also refer to it as a pilot mask or space mask and encourage your child to pretend to be a pilot or astronaut while inhaling the medication.
Pacifier attachments are available for infants. The pacifier helps to soothe the infant while he wears the mask.

, This will give the baby a bad experience with the nebulizer which will make it harder in the future. In addition, a crying baby will not successfully inhale the medication.When a baby cries, she makes a very quick inhalation and a long exhalation. This means that almost none of the medication will be inhaled deeply enough to make into the lungs.
If you cannot soothe your baby by holding her and singing to her, you may need to wait and try the nebulizer later when she is less fussy.
However, if your baby is having trouble breathing and will not calm, you can use the nebulizer for rescue treatments if needed to help her breathe, even if she is crying.
If your baby is a sound sleeper, you may be able to put the nebulizer on while she sleeps.

Wash your hands again.",How to Use a Bulb Syringe on a Baby," You should always consult your pediatrician before administering any type of medication or using any kind of medical device on your baby. Your doctor will be able to diagnose your baby, and provide an adequate treatment regime. If your baby is severely congested, you doctor might prescribe nose drops, and syringe your baby's nose during the appointment in order to provide immediate relief. Your doctor can also show you how to correctly use the bulb syringe., Congested noses can make it hard for your baby to breathe, and thus, to eat and sleep. They can also cause discomfort, like headaches. If your baby develops a congested nose that is preventing them from feeding and causing them discomfort, you should consult your doctor about using a bulb syringe on your baby's nose.Illnesses that can cause a congested nose are the common cold, influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis, and respiratory syncytial virus.

, You can buy a nasal bulb syringe from your local pharmacy, like CVS or Walgreens. You can also find them at Walmart. Bulb syringes might also come in packages with saline drops for the nose.


Also look in the baby section at Target or your local grocery store.
Buy a bulb syringe that is made from soft material like rubber or silicone.

, Wet your hands with warm running water. Apply soap and lather your hands by rubbing them together. Lather your hands for at least 20 seconds. Rinse your hands under clean, running water. Dry your hands using a clean towel, or air dry them., Place ¼ teaspoon of table salt in one cup of warm water in a jar or glass. Stir together until the salt is dissolved.You can also buy over-the-counter saline drops from your local pharmacy or drugstore.

, Make sure the nose dropper is not cracked or chipped. While squeezing the end of the nose dropper, place the tip of the dropper in the saline solution. Release the end of the nose dropper to allow the solution to enter into the nose dropper.

, Wrap your baby and its arms in a blanket. This is to keep your baby from using its hands to cover its nose and face, or swat the nose dropper. Then, lay your baby on its back with its face positioned towards the ceiling, i.e., looking up.Swaddle your baby by:Laying a blanket down on a flat surface. Fold the top corner to make the blanket a shape of a diamond. Place your baby on the folded blanket.
Holding your baby's right arm down by its side, fold the right side of the blanket over your baby's arm and body. Tuck the corner of the blanket under your baby's body by rolling your baby over on its side. Then roll your baby back on its back to hold the tucked corner in place.
Holding your baby's left arm down, pull the bottom corner of the blanket up and over your baby's shoulder. Tuck any remaining parts of the blanket under your baby's left arm and side. Make sure to leave enough room at the bottom of the blanket for your baby to bend and straighten its legs.
Pulling the blanket's lose left corner across your baby's front and to the right side. Wrap the blanket all the way around your baby's back and tuck.

, While holding your baby’s head, drop three to four drops of the saline solution into each nostril. Gently hold your baby’s head back for 1 minute to let the saline solution loosen the mucus.If your baby begins to cough or sneeze, help your baby sit up. Then lie your baby on its back again.
After the drops are administered, check to see if your baby's breathing has improved. Sometimes, saline drops alone are as effective as a bulb syringe. If your baby breathes better after the drops, there is no need to use the syringe.

, Before putting the bulb syringe in your baby’s nostril, squeeze all of the air out of the bulb with your thumb on the top of the bulb.Keep the bulb squeezed and place it in your baby’s nostril. While keeping the bulb squeezed, gently place the tip of the syringe into your baby’s nostril. Make sure the syringe seals the nostril.Do not push the syringe too far. This can cause discomfort and/or damage your baby’s nose.

, Once the syringe is in the nostril, slowly release your thumb to let the air come back in the bulb. The suction will pull the mucus out of your baby’s nose and into the bulb., To discard the mucus from the bulb, squeeze the bulb onto a tissue until all the mucus is removed.


Once the bulb is cleared of mucus, repeat steps one through four on the second nostril. Also, repeat these steps until all the mucus is removed from your baby’s nose., After you have removed all of the mucus, wipe your baby’s nose and face with a tissue. Make sure all mucus is removed from the outside of your baby’s nose and face to avoid irritation.Avoid placing any tissue or cotton swabs in your child's nose, as this could force the mucus upward and make it harder to remove.

, Fill a bowl with warm, soapy water. Place the bulb syringe and the nose dropper in the bowl. Squeeze and release the bulb syringe to let the soapy water enter into the bulb.

Place the thermometer in the armpit.,
Keep the thermometer in place.,
Wait for the temperature and record the reading.",How to Use a Baby Thermometer1," To take your baby's temperature by placing a thermometer in the armpit, you'll need a simple digital thermometer. You can find digital thermometers at you local pharmacy or grocery store. While this is one of the easiest ways to take your baby's temperature, it's also not as accurate as the other methods.You shouldn't use take your baby's temperature from the baby's armpit if the baby is under three months. This is because an accurate reading is important for newborns.;
, Take off your baby's shirt or onesie. Turn on the digital thermometer and put it under an armpit so that it comes into contact with the skin.

Choose a necklace made of Baltic amber.,
Verify that the amber is real.,
Choose a necklace with the right size beads.,
Look for a necklace that has knots between each of the beads.,
Look for a necklace that will fit your baby.,
Look for a necklace with a screw clasp.",How to Use a Baby Teething Necklace1," Baltic amber contains succinic acid, which is a natural remedy for inflammation and pain. Watch out for fake teething necklaces that are made of plastic as plastic will not work to bring your child relief. Keep in mind that some children may not have their pain relieved by these necklaces as it has not been confirmed that they actually work, though many parents and homeopathic practitioners believe that they do.When amber rests against your baby’s body, it heats up because of your baby’s body heat. When amber heats up, it releases oils that may help your baby to feel less pain while teething.;
, There are many fake amber teething necklaces out there. It is important to make sure that the one you purchase is real amber. To do this:


Heat the necklace by holding it near something warm, such as near a candle. If the necklace releases the scent of pine wood resin, it is real amber.
If the necklace begins to smell like its burning, it is most likely not real amber.

, Try to choose a necklace with small beads as teething necklaces could be a choking hazard if the baby were to lay down with a heavy necklace made of large beads around his or her neck. However, you should never leave your child unsupervised while he or she is wearing the necklace.


Look for beads that are round so that they do not have any edges that could cut your baby’s skin.

, Look at the necklace closely; can you see any knots in between each bead? These knots will prevent all of the beads from falling off the necklace if the necklace were to break. It is important to have these knots because if the necklace without knots were to break, the individual beads could become a choking hazard.

, Necklaces are generally 31 to 36 centimeters (11 to 14 inches) in length. To find the right size for your baby, measure the circumference of your baby’s neck. Then, look for a necklace that is a little larger than your baby’s neck so that it does not squeeze his or her neck.


At the same time, you should avoid really long necklaces that dangle down on to your baby’s chest. This is because a dangling necklace is more easy for your child to play with a potentially break.

, These clasps are the hardest to unhook, which is helpful if you are concerned that your baby will figure out how to take the necklace off.

Decide if your baby needs a bath.,
Select the type of bath tub.,
Put the tub in a safe place.,
Gather your items.,
Make sure the temperature of the water is safe.,
Add the right amount of water.,
Place your baby in the tub.,
Keep a hand on your baby at all times.,
Start washing your baby.,
Do not step away from your baby.,
Take your baby out of the tub.,
Clean the tub.",How to Use a Baby Bath Tub," Babies, especially young babies, don't need to bath everyday. Before you decide to bathe your baby, take a few minutes to determine if they need a bath that day. Keep some of the following ideas in mind when deciding if you need to bathe your baby:Babies under two to three weeks old should only have sponge baths. You can give a tub bath once the umbilical cord has fallen off and the stump has healed.
It's okay to bathe your baby only two or three times a week.
Bathing your baby too often can cause dry skin problems.;
, There are many different types of bathtubs that are made especially for babies. These tubs all have different shapes and safety mechanisms in mind that will help make bath-time safe and enjoyable for your child. Review the following styles of baby bath tubs to find one that is right for you:There are stand-alone plastic tubs that are designed for babies.
These tubs may have a textured bottom that will grip most surfaces to hold the tub in place.
Other baby baths may use a kind of sling or hammock that holds the baby over the tub while you bathe them.
You can purchase a plastic basin or inflatable tub to use inside a larger bathtub.

, After you have a baby bathtub selected you will need to make sure it is used in a safe place. Ideally you will place the bathtub low to the ground and on a stable and sturdy surface. Make sure the tub will not move during the bath and that it will safely contain both water and your baby.


Don't place the tub near any edges or areas where it could fall from.
Make sure the surface under the tub is safe and won't allow the tub to shift during the bath.
Place the tub in a place that lets you have full control over your baby during bath-time.

, It can be a good idea to fully prepare for your baby's bath before you start. Doing this will allow you to focus on the task, make it easier on both of you, and help make bath time safe and easy. Take a look at the following list to make sure you have the basics covered:Baby soap or shampoo if you are going to use it.
Your bath tub or prepared bathing space.
A washcloth.
A cup to rinse your baby with.
Towels to dry the baby off with after the bath.
Clean clothes and diaper to change into.

, Babies are very sensitive to both heat and cold. As a result, you will need to make sure that your baby's bath water is the right temperature. Remember some of the following key points when checking if the water is a safe temperature for your baby:Do not use hot water.
Bath water should be warm.
Mix the water to eliminate any cold or hot areas.
You should test the water with your wrist or the inside of your elbow.
A thermometer should read 37c/98.6f or 38c/100.4f.
Make sure the room temperature is comfortable and not too cool also.

, Although bathing your baby is necessary and some babies enjoy the process, it can also be a danger. Too much water can pose a hazard to your child. Since this is the case, you will need to make sure the bath has a safe amount of water in it.For newborns and very young babies, fill the bath with only 2” or 5cm of water.
Older babies and children can have the bath filled up to their waist level when seated.
Never leave your baby in the bath with the water running.
Never leave your baby in the bath alone.

, Your first step in bathing your baby is to introduce them to the water. Take your time and gently place your baby into the water and allow them to get used to it. Hold your baby in the following manner when you are lowering them into the bath:Place one hand under the baby's bottom.
Place your other hand under the baby’s head, supporting both the head and neck.
Don't put your baby in the water too quickly as this might alarm them.

, You will always need to keep at least one hand on your baby during bath-time. Taking both your hands off is too risky and can open your baby up to the danger of drowning. Never take a chance and always keep full control over your child's safety.


Keep one hand under the baby's head or neck at all times.
Use your free hand to wash your baby.

, Once your baby is safely in the water you can begin to bathe them. Most parents will begin by washing the child's hair and head, before moving down to wash the rest of the body. Keep some of the following tips in mind when cleaning your baby during their bath:Start by washing the baby's head or face. You won't always need to wash their hair.
Gently pour water over the baby's body during the bath to keep them warm.
Gently move down the rest of the body.
Try to clean in between any skin folds.
Wash your baby carefully and gently.
Try cupping your hand to keep any rinse-water from entering the baby's eyes.
Wash your baby's diaper area last.

, No matter what, do not ever leave your baby unattended during their bath. Doing so puts them in harm’s way, opening them up the danger of drowning. It only takes 3cm or around 1 inch of water for a baby to drown in and they won't always give obvious signs that they are in trouble., After your child is clean you can take them out of the tub. Make sure you have a good and safe grip on them as you remove them from the water and dry them off immediately. Remember some of the following tips when removing your baby from the tub:


Pick them up with both hands, placing one under their bottom and the other under their head.
Wrap them in a towel to keep them warm.
Thoroughly dry them off before dressing them again.
Make sure you dry off the areas between any skin folds.

, After your baby is out of the tub, dried off, and safely watched after, you will want to clean the tub. Although you just cleaned your baby using the tub, the tub itself may accumulate soap residue or other substances that can make the tub dirty. Try to clean the baby tub after every bath in order to keep it clean and safe for your baby.


You can use soap and water to clean the baby bath.
Avoid using any harsh cleaning chemicals as these may come in contact with your baby if left on the bath.

Get a tympanic (ear) thermometer.,
Turn on the thermometer and insert the tip.,
Wait for the beep and record the temperature.",How to Use a Baby Thermometer2," A digital tympanic thermometer measures the infrared heat waves from your baby's eardrum. These thermometers have a narrowed tip that is inserted into the outer ear canal. Many come with protective plastic coverings that you can discard after each reading.Tympanic thermometers are best for babies over six months old. The ear canals of babies younger than six months are too small to get accurate readings.

, The thermometer should be on when you insert the tip and direct it toward the baby's opposite eye. If your baby is over one year old, you should also pull the baby's earlobe slightly outward before you insert the thermometer. This will straighten the ear canal for an accurate reading.Many tympanic thermometers will make a sound or alert you if the thermometer isn't inserted correctly or if it can't take an accurate reading. Be sure to read your owner's manual.

, Depending on your thermometer, you may need to wait a few seconds before pressing a button to record the temperature. Your digital thermometer may work without you needing to press anything. Either way, the thermometer will probably beep when a temperature is taken. Remove the thermometer and record the temperature.If your baby has been outside on a chilly day, wait 15 minutes before checking the temperature. Don't worry if your baby has tubes in its ears or earwax since these shouldn't affect the temperature reading.
Note also that the temperature may not be accurate if your baby has an ear infection on the side you take it.

Get a thermometer.,
Clean and lubricate the thermometer.,
Position your baby.,
Insert the thermometer and take the temperature.",How to Use a Baby Thermometer3," To take a rectal temperature, you'll need a multi-use digital thermometer or a rectal thermometer. The thermometer should have a flexible tip with a wide handle so you can easily insert it just a little into the baby's rectum. If you use a multi-use digital thermometer, designate it just for use in taking rectal temperatures. Get another digital thermometer if you plan on taking oral or axillary temperatures.Taking your baby's temperature rectally is one of the most accurate ways to check temperature, especially in babies from newborn age to three years old.

, Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and rub it over the tip of the digital thermometer. You could also wash the tip in soap and water if you don't have rubbing alcohol. Rinse the soap away with cool water. Rub a little bit of petroleum jelly or lubricant on the end of the thermometer.Avoid rinsing the thermometer with hot water since this could cause inaccurate temperature readings.

, Lay your baby belly down across your lap or on a table. Keep your baby still by putting the palm of your hand against the baby's lower back near the bottom.If your baby squirms too much, try keeping your baby face up. Bend your baby's legs towards the chest so the bottom is exposed.

, Use your free hand to gently insert the thermometer into your baby's rectum. You should only insert it 1/2 inch to an inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm). Hold the thermometer in place while cupping your baby's bottom. Leave the thermometer in place until you hear a beep, signaling that the temperature was recorded. Remove the thermometer and write down the temperature.If you insert the thermometer more than an inch, you risk damaging your baby's rectum."

Get a thermometer.,
Put the thermometer sensor on the forehead.,
Swipe the sensor across the forehead.,
Stop and release the button.",How to Use a Baby Thermometer4," You'll need a temporal artery (forehead) thermometer. These are usually digital and work by recording the temperature of infrared heat waves from the temporal artery in the baby's forehead. This type of thermometer can be expensive, but it's easy to use.Temporal artery (forehead) thermometers work reliably in babies of all ages and are likely more accurate than axillary (armpit) thermometers in babies under three months old. (A rectal temperature is still recommended for babies under 3 months old.)

, The temporal artery thermometer will have a circular tip that looks like a flattened knob. Place this sensor head on the center of your baby's forehead.Make sure you're using a digital thermometer designed for temporal artery readings. These are not the same as forehead strips, which should not be used because they're too inaccurate.

, Press down the thermometer's ""on"" or ""start"" button while you slowly move the thermometer's sensor across your baby's forehead. Keep holding down the button until you reach the top of the baby's ear.Keep the sensor against your baby's skin the entire time you sweep it across the forehead.
Or, follow the manufacturer's directions on the package, especially while you are learning how to use the thermometer.

, You can stop holding down the button when you get to your baby's hairline. By this point, the thermometer should display your baby's temperature on the digital screen. Record the temperature.The reading should only take a couple of seconds, making this the fastest and one of the most accurate way to take your baby's temperature.

Place the teething necklace around your baby's neck.,
Check to see that the necklace fits your baby.,
Put the necklace under your baby’s shirt.,
Supervise your child while he or she is wearing the teething necklace.,
Do not let your baby chew on the necklace.",How to Use a Baby Teething Necklace2," When you put the necklace on your baby, make sure that it is loose enough that it does not leave impressions on your baby’s skin. Make sure to tightly screw the clasp into place so that your baby can’t take the necklace off.

, In addition to making sure that the necklace is not too tight, it is also important to check that the necklace cannot reach your baby’s chin. If the necklace can do this, he or she might also be able to put it into his or her mouth.


If it can reach your baby’s mouth, you will have to shorten the necklace if you can, or take it back and purchase a shorter one.

, In order for the amber to release the chemicals that will help soothe your child’s teething pain, it must be placed against his or her skin. However, its also important to make sure that the child does not play with the necklace, so putting the necklace under his or her shirt were help to do both of these things.


If you put the necklace over your baby’s shirt, it will not get enough heat to work properly.

Cracked
Red
Tender
Dry
Leathery
Thick
Itchy
Crusting
Red patches
Small blisters;
, If you notice your baby having an eczema flare up in response to particular irritants, you should record them in your health journal. Ask your doctor if there is a connection to your baby’s eczema. Possible irritants and allergens that could make your baby’s eczema worse include:Cow’s milk
Dust mites
Woolen and synthetic fibres
Heavy bedding
Animal dander
Pollen
Dust
Mold
Dry air
Harsh soaps
Harsh detergents
Strong shampoo
Chemicals in bubble baths
Hot or cold temperatures

, You could try taking probiotics during breastfeeding in order to reduce the chance of baby eczema. Although more research is required, there is some indication that probiotics during pregnancy may lower the chance of your baby getting eczema. You could take probiotic supplements or eat more yogurt that contains live active cultures.Breastfeeding itself can reduce the occurrence of baby eczema compared with formula feeding.

, It can be hard to keep track of all of the treatments you try for your baby’s eczema. To keep track of your baby’s symptoms, your doctor’s prescriptions and any home remedies you try, record everything in a health diary. For example, consider recording the following:Eczema flare ups
Symptoms
Irritants
Topical or oral medications used to treat your baby's eczema
Details from trips to the doctor such as date and prescriptions

, Since hot water can remove too much oil from your baby’s skin, you should bathe them in lukewarm water. You should also avoid excessive amounts of bathing.Give your baby a ten-minute bath about 2-3 times per week., Many cleansers and soaps have additives that irritate or dry out your baby’s skin, which will make the eczema worse. Instead, look for soap products that are unscented and with few additives.For example, you might try a natural product, like Burt’s Bees Baby Bee Shampoo and Wash, an unscented product, such as Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar, or another dermatologist recommended product, such as Aveeno, Cetaphil, CeraVe, or Eucerin., Your doctor may recommend bleach baths if your baby has moderate or severe eczema. Bleach baths will help control the bacteria on your baby’s skin. If your doctor recommends a bleach bath, put one or two teaspoons (15-30 milliliters) of bleach per gallon (4 liters) of water or add 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) to a half-tub of water. Use lukewarm water, and bathe your baby for ten minutes.Make sure your baby does not touch their eyes while in the bleach bath.
You should only do the bleach bath two or three times per week.
Within three minutes of leaving the bath, you should moisturize your baby’s skin.

, Apply a thick layer of moisturizer to your baby’s skin two to three times per day. Every time your baby gets out of a bath, you should immediately moisturize their skin. Generally, ointment based moisturizers are best because they contain the most oil. If you cannot find an ointment, creams are also good. Lotions have less oil and don’t hold in the moisture as well, so pick an ointment or cream instead., Eczema creams have ingredients to reduce the itching and moisturize the skin. You should consult your doctor before using any steroid ointments and always follow the directions when using them. If used appropriately and according to your doctor's directions, topical steroids are a safe and effective treatment for infantile eczema.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends topical steroids alongside an action plan for families that addresses bathing as well as moisturizers.If you use doctor prescribed steroid ointments or creams, you should use the lowest strength possible.Some creams use a mild hydrocortisone or colloidal oatmeal to control itching.
You should avoid aqueous cream because it contains detergents that may irritate your baby’s skin., If you need to apply a steroid ointment or cream, you should apply a small to moderate amount and use a mild steroid, unless your doctor recommends you use a stronger steroid for a period of time. Try to avoid applying the steroid ointment to the groin, armpits and other creases in your baby’s skin. It should only be applied to the area affected by the eczema. Once it is applied, you will need to apply a layer of moisturizer., Your doctor may recommend an antihistamine to help control your baby’s itching. The antihistamine may make your baby drowsy, which may help if they are having a hard time with itching at night.Common antihistamines include Benadryl, Claritin and Zyrtec. Ask your doctor before using any of these products., A dermatologist may prescribe stronger creams or ointments for your baby's eczema, or in some cases oral medications or antibiotics if the eczema was caused by an infection. Your dermatologist can also use light therapies to treat your baby.

Wet wraps usually help with severe flare-ups. To use a wet wrap, soak your baby in warm water. Then apply the prescribed ointment or cream. While the ointment or cream is still wet, soak the wrap in warm water and then apply it over the cream. Finally, wrap a dry bandage over the wet cloths. You can remoisten the wraps by spraying water on the wet cloth. Wet wraps are usually used for a few days, but follow the specific recommendations of your doctor.Do not use a wet wrap unless it's recommended by your doctor.

Consult a doctor or pediatrician before switching formulas.,
Consider a new formula with the same protein type.,
Choose a formula with a different protein for digestive intolerances.,
Read the formula labels.,
Switch formula immediately if you are using the same protein.,
Transition gradually to a new formula if you are changing the main protein.,
Increase the ration of new formula to old formula.,
Watch for digestive problems.,
Notice hives or a rash.,
Look for blood in your baby’s stool or vomit.",How to Switch Baby Formula," You should always talk with your doctor before switching formulas. This includes if you are switching for dietary or financial reasons. Your doctor will be able to recommend a formula suitable for your baby and can help you with the transition to a new formula.If your baby gets hives, a rash, redness, or vomits forcefully after drinking formula, they may have a true allergy to the milk or soy protein found within the formula.
Your doctor or pediatrician may also recommend switching formulas for dietary reasons. For example, your baby may need more iron in their diet and, therefore, an iron-fortified formula may be best.
If the doctor does not suspect a true medical problem; however, they may be able to recommend a brand or formula that can improve other health symptoms, such as fussiness, gas, iron deficiency, or poor weight gain.;
, It will be easiest on your baby’s digestive system to stick with the same protein type when switching formulas. If you have decided to try a new brand for cost rather than medical reasons, this should be relatively easy. For example, if your baby's current formula uses cows' milk as the protein type, then you should choose a new less expensive formula that also uses cows' milk., If you are switching formulas because your baby has a digestive intolerance, you will need to choose a formula with a different protein type. See which new formula your doctor thinks will help your baby's digestion.Your doctor may recommend that you try a soy-based formula instead of a cows' milk formula to treat a lactose intolerance.

, If your baby was previously drinking a formula with iron, DHA, or other additives, consider selecting another formula with those characteristics. Reading the label will also help you understand the ingredients and you can avoid any ingredients that may cause an allergic reaction in your baby.

, In some instances, your baby will be able to switch formulas relatively easily and will not fuss about a new type of formula. Try giving your baby a little bit of the new formula to see how they react. If there is no issue, then you can switch to the new formula immediately.Similarly, if your baby is allergic to their old formula, you may need to switch completely to the new formula with no period of transition.

, In some cases, your baby may be a little fussy about the taste of the new formula. In these instances, switch formulas gradually. This will mask the flavour of the new formula and make the transition easier.Begin the transition by giving your baby ¾ of the old formula and ¼ of the new formula.
Feed your baby this mixture for one day. Then, try half of the old formula with half of the new formula and feed your baby this mixture for one day.

, Continue to increase the ratio of new formula to old formula each day. For example, on the third day feed your baby a mixture of ¼ of the old formula with ¾ of the new formula and on the fourth day give your baby 100% of the new formula.By this point your baby should expect the flavour of the new formula.

, While transitioning from one formula to another, monitor your baby. Watch for persistent vomiting, diarrhea, excessive gas, or constipation. These are all signs that your baby may be experiencing an allergic reaction. Allergic reactions differ from normal digestive irritation because they are chronic and may impact your baby's ability to gain weight.For instance, acute diarrhea and gas is common among babies, but chronic diarrhea or constipation often means the child has an intolerance.If you believe your baby has an allergy to the new formula, seek medical attention immediately.

, Allergies can also present themselves on the surface of the skin in the form of hives or rashes. If you baby begins to develop a rash, you should take them to a doctor immediately. This could be a sign that they are allergic to the new formula., If you notice blood in your baby’s stool or vomit, you should take your baby to the emergency room immediately. This is a sign of a severe allergic reaction and needs medical treatment."

You should sterilize every part of the bottle, including the nipple and attachment rings.;
, You should do this while your child is very young, as her immune system will be weaker than when she is older. As your child grows, you can gradually switch to sterilizing the bottles after every few uses during the first six months of your baby’s life., Sterilizing a baby bottle isn’t effective if the bottle isn’t clean first.Always rinse and wash baby bottles with baby-safe dish soap before sterilizing them.


Be sure to wash your hands before touching a baby bottle to limit the amount of dirt and germs that touch the feeding tools.

, After your baby reaches six months of age, your baby’s immune system is stronger, and cleaning the bottle by hand with dish soap or in the dishwasher is sufficient., To sterilize by boiling, place the baby bottles and all other feeding equipment in a large saucepan and cover them with water. Cover the pot with a lid and bring the water to a boil—keep the water boiling for five minutes.


Leave the lid on as the water cools, then drain the water and store the equipment in the refrigerator until needed.

, To sterilize the bottles with baking soda, fill a large pot with water and three tablespoons of baking soda. Add the bottles and accessories to the pot. Bring the water to a boil and allow the water to boil for at least three minutes. Once the water has cooled, remove the bottles and allow them to air dry before use.


Baking soda can be incredibly useful for more worn baby bottles, or if you want an extra boost to the sterilization.

, To sterilize the bottles in the dishwasher, simply put the glass baby bottles on the top rack of the washer and put the accessories in a basket on the top rack. Run a hot rinse cycle and allow the bottles to dry completely either in the dishwasher or on the counter., Special microwave baby bottle sterilizers can be purchased at any baby store. Follow the instructions on the sterilizer’s package:


They typically require you to put a small amount of water in the bottom of the device, place the bottle inside, and microwave on high.
The steam and hot water from the microwave remove germs and bacteria from the bottle.

(200 ml) of water, but this amount can vary depending on the manufacturer. Too little water may not sterilize the bottles properly, but too much could cause the basin to overflow.;
, Place one bottle upside-down on each prong. Do not attempt to load more bottles into the sterilizer than there are prongs. Most only have room for about six bottles, so if you have more than that, you will need to clean the bottles in batches.

, These other pieces should be spaced apart evenly enough so that they do not touch. If the sterilizer has lower prongs, space them in between these prongs to hold them in place.

, In order to clean the bottles, the sterilizer will need to generate steam. The steam needs to be contained in order to have the desired effect.

, It should automatically begin heating the bottles to 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), creating enough steam to kill off any bacteria. For most electric steam sterilizers, the process takes about 10 minutes.

, Do not attempt to remove them until after the sterilizer finishes its cooling cycle. Dry the bottles with a clean dish towel or allow them to air dry.

Get your baby used to the movement.,
Allow the baby to hold the bottle with you.,
Watch your baby's motor skills.,
Help them to understand the relationship between the bottle and feeding.,
Give the baby an empty bottle.,
Keep the baby in the correct position.,
Remove any distractions.,
Help your baby out.,
Support her arms.,
Hold your baby as she feeds.,
Never leave your baby unattended.",How to Get Your Child to Hold Their Own Bottle," If you are feeding your baby with formula rather than breast feeding, you can start familiarizing your baby with the feel of the bottle from as early as 2 to 3 months.


Take your baby's hand and press it gently against the side of the bottle as you feel her. This will get her used to the correct arm motion and the feel of the bottle.
Of course, your baby is still far too young to know what she is doing or to support the weight of the bottle by herself, so keep a firm grasp on it at all times.;
, Once your baby reaches between 6 and 10 months old, you can encourage them to hold the bottle with you during feeding.


Once you feel that they have a firm grasp on the bottle and can support it's weight by their self (while still being able to feed), you can experiment with letting go of the bottle for short periods of time.
Remember that all babies develop differently, and while some might be able to hold their own bottle from as young as six months, others will take longer. The size and shape of the bottle can also make a difference. Some bottles are better designed to fit in a baby's hands than others.

, A good way to identify whether your baby is ready to try holding their own bottle is to keep an eye on their motor skills.


If your baby has mastered holding and grabbing objects around them such as toys (or chunks of hair!) she may be ready to hold the bottle.
Remember that the smaller the item that your baby is able to pick up, the more advanced their motor skills are, so if they're able to pick up small pieces of food, they're probably ready to hold their own bottle.

, The best incentive for your baby to learn how to hold the bottle is hunger. So the best time to practice bottle holding is during baby's first feed of the morning, when she is probably hungriest.

, Another way of determining whether your baby is ready to feed herself is to hand her an empty bottle and then observe her to see what she does with it.


If the baby is able to grasp the bottle and knows that she is supposed to bring the nipple to her lips and put it in her mouth, this proves that she knows what the bottle is for and how to use it.
Try the same technique again with a full bottle to ensure that she is able to handle the weight of it before you allow her to feed herself.

, When teaching the baby to hold her own bottle, make sure her head is raised above the level of her feet.


You can do this by holding her in your arms, or by propping her up on a pillow on your bed.
This is important, because if the baby is feeding while in a horizontal position, milk may trickle from her mouth into her ear. If the milk reaches the Eustachian tube it can lead to ear infection.

, When teaching your baby to hold her own bottle, turn off any bright lights and music and remove any toys before feeding. These things can be distracting for a baby, and she needs to concentrate if she's going to learn the new skill of holding her own bottle.

, Even if your baby is able to hold the bottle herself, there are still some things you should do to help her. When beginning to feed, hold the bottle yourself for a moment until the baby gets a firm grasp with both hands. Make sure she is holding on tightly before you let go.


Keep a close eye on her while she feeds. Make sure she is holding the bottle at the correct angle so she is not sucking in air, which can cause bloating and gas.
If the bottle slips or falls out of her hands, pick it up and clean it off (if necessary), then set it back in her hands and let her try again.

, Holding up a heavy bottle can be tiring for your baby's little arms, so it's a good idea to support her forearms and elbows while she feeds.


Try wrapping your hands around the baby's wrists to help her support the weight of the bottle and help her hold the bottle at the correct angle.
You can also purchase additional equipment that makes it easier for your baby to feed herself. Consider buying Velcro straps that keep the bottle attached to the baby's wrists, or purchase special bottle holders that are easier for your baby to wrap her little fingers around.

, Even if your baby is now able to feed herself, it's important that you continue to hold her as she feeds.


Feeding time has always been a special, quiet, bonding time for the two of you, and there's no reason to give that up just yet.
Holding the baby and making lots of eye contact with her as she feeds will help her to feel loved and secure. You can even sing softly to her or talk to her as she feeds.

, Even if your baby soon becomes confident holding the bottle by yourself, you should never allow her to feed unattended. She may swallow her milk the wrong way, causing her to cough or even choke.


Always stay in the same room as your child when she is feeding and don't allow yourself to get too distracted.

Make sure to thaw frozen breast milk before it turns bad. When stored in a deep freezer, it can last from 6 to 12 months, but when stored in a standard freezer attached to the refrigerator, it only lasts 3 to 6 months. If kept in a freezer compartment of a refrigerator, breast milk is only good for 2 weeks.Place the container of breast milk near the front of the refrigerator as you thaw it. The front of the refrigerator is slightly warmer than the back but still safe enough to thaw the milk.;
, Give the container of breast milk about 8 hours to defrost completely.


Check that it is thoroughly defrosted by opening the container and stirring it with a spoon or coffee stirrer. If you feel any frozen chunks of breast milk, allow the container to thaw in the refrigerator for another couple of hours or finish thawing it quickly by placing it under cool to lukewarm running water.

, Thawed breast milk is best used immediately, but it is safe for your baby to drink when stored in the refrigerator for up to five days.


Move the container to the back of the refrigerator, where temperatures tend to be the coldest.

, Re-freezing the breast milk can cause lipids in the milk to degrade. The milk will be of lower quality and may even start to spoil.

Place frozen breast milk under cool water.,
Gradually increase the temperature of the water.,
Warm chilled breast milk under warm water.,
Swirl the milk around.",How to Warm Breast Milk2," If you are warming breast milk straight from a frozen state, begin by holding the container of frozen breast milk under cool running water.The water should be just slightly cooler than room temperature.
Using cool water for this initial stage is recommended because it brings the temperature of the breast milk up more gradually. If you immediately jumped to hot water, you could cause hot spots to form along the outside while the inside remained frozen. Moreover, you could also accidentally destroy more of the valuable enzymes contained in the breast milk.
Only use cool water until you feel that the breast milk has thawed. Looking into the container, you should only see liquid and no floating chunks of frozen breast milk. Gently shake the container to feel for hidden chunks of frozen milk.

, Slowly increase the temperature of the running water after the milk is thawed.


Increase the water from cool to room temperature, from room temperature to warm, and from warm to hot. Bringing the temperature up slowly destroys fewer enzymes in the milk and heats it more evenly.
Stop before the water begins to steam. You do not want to make the breast milk so hot that it burns your baby's sensitive mouth.
Note that chilled breast milk is perfectly safe for your baby to drink, but if you have a fussy eater, you may need to warm it to room temperature to make it seem more appetizing., If you thawed the milk in the refrigerator or only had it stored in the refrigerator to start with, skip the cool water stage and place the container of breast milk directly under warm running water.


Gradually increase the temperature of the water from warm to hot, stopping before the water begins to steam.

, Make sure that the breast milk is evenly warmed by gently swirling the container or bottle, thereby swirling the milk around.


You could also even out the temperature by stirring the breast milk with a spoon or coffee stirrer.

Do not allow the water to reach its boiling point, as it may end up heating the breast milk too quickly if it is this hot.
Always pull the pot of water off the stove before preparing to put the bottle or container of breast milk inside. Never directly heat the breast milk over the stove.







,


It is safe to allow the bottle to touch the bottom of the pot once you remove the pot from the stove, but if you are still apprehensive, simply hold the bottle in the water without letting it touch the bottom.
You can warm breast milk from a frozen or chilled state using this method. If you are warming breast milk from a chilled state, it should only take a few minutes. If warming it from a thawed state, it may take twice the time.

, Carefully swirl the bottle or container of milk to even out the temperature.


You could also stir the milk with a spoon or coffee stirrer to accomplish the same task.

Read the instructions.,
Note whether the warmer uses a bath or steam.Some bottle warmers warm the bottle in a hot water bath, but most use steam.,
Fill the water reservoir.,
Insert the bottle.,
Set the control dial and warm the milk.",How to Warm Breast Milk4," No two bottle warmers are exactly alike, so it is essential that you read the instructions thoroughly before using it.


While the exact specifications and instructions vary from machine to machine, there are some general similarities.
Note that many, though not all, bottle warmers can also double as baby food warmers for when your child starts eating solids and cereals.

,


Bottle warmers that use a warm water bath work the same, in principle, as a warm water bath you create without a bottle warmer. The bottle of breast milk is immersed directly into the heated water.
Bottle warmers that use steam use less water. The water is heated in a separate compartment by a heating element or hot plate, and the steam comes up into the bottle compartment to warm the breast milk. This is a more gradual heating method.

, Pour tap water into the reservoir up to the bottle warmer's ""fill line.""


If the warmer has no fill line, check the instructions to determine how much water to use.






Water bath warmers tend to use more water than steam warmers.
The water should be changed in between uses for almost all water bath warmers and most steam warmers. Some steam warmers have reservoirs that stay filled until the levels dip too low, at which point a refill sensor light goes off.

, Secure the bottle of breast milk in the warmer, placing it inside the bottle compartment.


The bottle will sit loose in some warmers, while others may require you to ""snap"" it into place.

, Follow the instructions to determine how high or low to set the temperature dial, if the warmer has a dial. Press the start button and wait for the appliance to click off.


Most bottle warmers have a sensor light that comes on and off to tell you when the warming session is done. Others also make a ring or alarm noise when the process is done.

You should use a nipple that does not collapse and has the right sized hole. It should squirt in drops.;
, Just use a sponge to wipe the sides,inside and outside clean. Make sure you rinse out all of the soap to prevent the baby from getting sick.

, If you are using powdered formula,mix it with water and then pour in. If you have it already made, just pour it in!

, Do NOT use a microwave. Microwaves heat things unevenly,so some of the formula will be scalding hot,while another amount will be the right temperature. Heat the formula by putting it in a bucket of hot water. Before serving it to your baby,check its temperature by squirting some on your wrist.

, Make sure that the baby is sitting up while feeding,so they don't have stomach troubles. Don't forget to burp the infant,too!

Keep track of your baby’s weight.,
Ask your pediatrician.,
Talk to a lactation consultant early on if you have twins or triplets.,
Discuss the medical reasons for low milk supply with your doctor.",How to Use Fenugreek Seeds to Increase Milk Supply1," The majority of women do produce enough for their babies. Breastfeeding and the way it feels can change throughout the time you nurse your baby. You may think that your supply is low, but typically you’re just responding to some of the changes your body goes through as it becomes more used to breastfeeding. If you leaked a lot of milk in the beginning and now do not -- this is not decreased milk supply, it’s just your body regulating the amount of milk it is making to the appropriate level for your baby., This is the best and easiest way to tell if your infant needs you to produce more milk. Babies typically weigh an ounce more each day from birth to three months (after the weight drop following birth) and then about a half ounce each day from 3-6 months. If babies weigh within a normal range, eat well, and appear healthy and happy, you are probably fine. , Mothers produce different amounts of milk, but almost always enough for a single baby. Typically your milk supply will regulate itself after a few weeks following your baby's birth, producing enough for your child. but sometimes that doesn't happen. You also might experience decreased milk production once you start back to work and have to start pumping.

, Mothers of multiples often have difficulty keeping up with nursing two or more babies. For these mothers, low milk production is an issue, and some do decide to take fenugreek. , Women with fertility issues often face problems with milk supply. Environmental toxins can also be a culprit. Women who have had breast cancer or breast surgery also report low milk problems. Finally, for some women, not fully draining the breasts becomes an issue in continuing to produce milk. The breasts need to be regularly drained of milk so that they can become completely full again.

If it isn’t, simply reposition the pad. This can help prevent wet clothes, leaks, and irritation.Be aware that it’s normal for your breast pads to show through your clothing. You can buy thinner ones if you have less leakage that won’t show through your bra or clothing., Active pregnant women and mothers may notice that their breast pads slide during use. This is normal, especially if you are not using pads with sticky pieces. If you feel like your nursing pad is sliding around in your bra, check it and remove or reposition the pad. This can contain leaks and prevent irritation., Moisture on your breast can lead to skin irritation and even infection. Changing your nursing pads as soon as you notice they are wet can prevent leaks, irritation, and potential infections from bacteria.Remove your breast pads as often as you need. There is no rule for how often you need to change. How long you wear the pads may vary day to day.

, If you notice your pads are moist, wet or leaking, take off your shirt. Then gently remove the pad from your nipple to avoid pulling your skin. If the pad is stuck to your skin, simply moisten it with some warm water. This can prevent removing any skin as you pull the pad away from your breast., You’ll likely want to get rid of your soiled breast pad. If you are using disposable ones, throw the old pads away.

You may need to wear breast pads for anywhere from a few weeks to months. Your needs may also change over time. Keeping a notebook of colostrum or milk production can help you figure out your needs and find the best breast pads for you. Some things you may want to consider are:How much milk do I leak? Does it change during the day?
How long do I plan on breastfeeding?
Do I want to collect the leaking milk for my baby?
Do I want a breast pad that moisturizes?
Do I care if my breast pads are visible?
Do I want a simple pad or one contoured to my breast?
How much money do I want to spend?
Do I want natural fabric?

This ensures that you don’t run out and risk a leak on to your clothing.Purchase lanolin pads if you have breast irritation. These help heal and protect sore breasts., Most women won’t need breast pads for very long. If you prefer to not invest in nursing pads, you can also make your own out of common items in your home. Construct your own breast pads by:Tucking a cotton handkerchief inside your bra
Cutting a four inch circle from a cloth diaper
Cutting sanitary pads or liners into small squares

, Plastic-lined breast pads may sound like a great idea to contain leaks and wetness and protect your clothes. However, these can retain moisture, which promotes bacterial growth and can contribute to sore nipples. If you are experiencing a lot of leakage, consider using a larger and more absorbent breast pad."

Hold your baby in your arms with her back lying along your inner arm.
Her head should be on your forearm.
Your baby should be facing your breast, with her mouth aligned with your nipple.
Pillows can be used to raise her to the appropriate nipple height.
Her head and bottom should be aligned with each other.;
,


While sitting upright, place one or more pillows on your lap in order to raise the baby up to nipple height.
Use the cradle hold with the opposite arm. Use your hand to support your baby’s head and place a pillow under your hand for support. Your free hand will support you breast.
With your baby turned on her side facing you, touch her lips with your nipple. When she opens her mouth to begin sucking, pull her close to you. You breast will open the baby’s mouth further for bigger mouthfuls of milk.

,


Sit upright with your back and shoulders well supported.
Place a pillow on your lap, towards the side of your hip.
Place your baby on the pillow, facing you.
Her mouth should be aligned with your nipple.
Tuck her legs and feet under your arm and bend her slightly at the waist so that her legs stretch out along your back.
The soles of her feet should be facing the ceiling with her leg’s pointing upwards and her bottom resting on the pillow.

Ask your lactation consultant about fenugreek.,
Take fenugreek if you have decided it’s a good choice.,
Monitor yourself for any side effects.,
Refrain from taking fenugreek if you are pregnant.",How to Use Fenugreek Seeds to Increase Milk Supply2," There are strong opinions on both sides about its efficacy. Some people claim that it can increase milk production dramatically, while scientific studies show that there is only anecdotal evidence to support those claims. If you are still unsure after talking to your lactation consultant, ask your OB/GYN for their advice. , It is typically available from vitamin and health food stores and comes as a powder in pill form. You can take the seeds if you choose (a teaspoon = about 3 capsules) but it is much easier to find it in pill form. The recommended dosage is 2-3 capsules or 3 times a day. Women who have taken it report an increased milk supply 1-3 days after taking it. Once you have reached a point at which you have enough milk, discontinue taking the pills., Many mothers report urine or sweat that smells like maple syrup, which ends when they stop taking the pills. More serious side effects include flatulence and diarrhea, which again will end when the pills are discontinued. Be aware that women with diabetes, hypoglycemia, or asthma need to be very careful when consuming fenugreek because it can aggravate their conditions., Fenugreek can affect the uterus, even causing preterm labor. If you think you may become pregnant, also refrain from taking fenugreek."

Sleep as much as you can.,
Drink water.,
Eat healthy.,
Breastfeed more often.,
Choose formula for your baby.",How to Use Fenugreek Seeds to Increase Milk Supply3," Even though life with an infant often doesn't allow for long stretches of uninterrupted sleep, try to nap when you're tired if you can. Being well rested helps keep up your supply.

, 64 ounces a day minimum is a good place to start. Nursing depletes your body of liquids and you need to replenish yourself., You might find that you need bigger portions. This is normal. Feeding an infant requires about 20 calories for one ounce of milk. This means that you will probably burn between 400 and 600 calories daily, depending on how much your baby eats. Focus on eating fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and fish, and don't shy away from good fats like nuts and avocados. , Sometimes the best and easiest way to stimulate more milk supply is to feed you baby more frequently. Rather than every 2.5 to 3 hours (the recommended length of time between feelings) try every hour or hour and a half., If nothing else seems to be working, your baby can get the nutrients he or she needs in formula. Breastfeeding can be wonderful and healthy for both the mother in baby in the right conditions, but it doesn’t always work for everyone.

Make sure that the baby is correctly latching on to your nipple.,
Touch your nipple to the baby’s lip.,
Insert the nipple far into the baby’s mouth as soon as she opens her mouth wide enough for you to do so.,
Pay attention to baby’s sucking and swallowing action.",How to Use Different Breast Feeding Positions2," Many times it can be difficult to know if your child is latching on properly.


It is important to make sure that the baby’s mouth is covering a large portion of the nipple and not just the tip.
The baby’s head should be held firmly against the breast to ensure that the nipple is not pulled to the side in any way.
Always make sure that you gently press your breast down with one finger so that it is not covering the baby’s nose at all. If the nose is obstructed, the baby will not be able to breathe properly.

, If the baby turns her head away from the breast before you can make contact, gently stroke the baby’s cheek with your nipple or the tip of your finger. This will stimulate the baby’s rooting reflex, which will make her instinctively turn her head towards your beast.

,


Make sure that a large portion of the nipple is placed into the baby’s mouth.
Avoid inserting just the tip into the baby’s mouth, as this can interfere with proper latching and can result in nipple soreness or cracked nipples.

,


If you see that the baby is just holding the nipple in her mouth, you may need to stimulate her to nurse. If she continues to avoid sucking, she may be too tired to nurse at the moment and you may have to try again later.
If you see that she is sucking but not swallowing, she may just be using your breast as a pacifier to help ease her to sleep. If this continues, try again after a brief nap.
When baby sucks at the breast, you should notice a slight pulling sensation at the nipple. If you do not experience this sensation, she may not be sucking enough to stimulate milk let-down. However, it is possible that your baby will be nursing just fine and you will not feel the tugging sensation. For this reason, you will also have to pay close attention to her sucking and swallowing habits.
If the pulling sensation is too strong, your baby may not have enough of the nipple in her mouth. Be sure to insert more of the surface area of the nipple into the mouth to prevent improper latching

Allow your baby to set the pace.,
Be ready to offer the other breast to baby if it appears that she is still hungry after emptying the first breast.,
Begin each feeding session with the opposite breast of the one that was used first during the last feeding.,
Insert your finger into the corner of baby’s mouth to break suction when necessary.",How to Use Different Breast Feeding Positions3," Although some parents prefer to schedule feedings, this method is generally not recommended for breastfed babies. Unlike formula-fed babies who are given a specific number of ounces of formula per feeding, there is no way to gauge exactly how many ounces of breast milk your baby is eating. For this reason, it is recommended that breastfed babies be fed on demand. Your baby will determine when she is hungry and will provide the cues to alert you.

, She will decide when she has had enough to satisfy her needs. Some babies will need encouragement to empty the first breast, others will be completely satisfied after just one breast and some babies may need to empty both breasts to feel full.

,


Alternating breasts at each session will prevent one breast from becoming engorged with milk while allowing each breast time to replenish the milk supply.
The composition of the milk changes throughout the nursing session. Fore milk is the milk that is produced during the beginning of a nursing session. It is a thinner consistency and does not contain much fat. It is the first portion of the milk to trickle out of the milk ducts, leaving behind the fat cells. This milk quenches the baby’s thirst.
Nursing stimulates increased milk production, which causes ducts to squeeze out additional milk, along with the fat cells that were left behind. This milk is produced towards the end of the nursing session and is referred to as the hind milk. By alternating breasts at the start of every nursing session, you can ensure that your baby is receiving the benefits of both types of milk.

, You should never pull your nipple out of baby’s mouth without first breaking suction; otherwise you may begin to experience tender nipples. In addition, the abrupt cessation of milk may cause your baby to become irritable.

Refrain from offering a newborn baby a pacifier as it may interfere with breast feeding.,
Remain calm when baby is fussing.,
Avoid bending over to feed your baby or you may also find yourself experiencing shoulder, neck and back discomfort as well as sore nipples.",How to Use Different Breast Feeding Positions4," Once breast feeding has been established, a pacifier can be introduced. It is generally best to wait until the baby is 3 to 4 weeks old to prevent nipple confusion.

, Breast feeding can be challenging for both you and your baby. When you are stressed, your body may not trigger the let-down response. Additionally, if you are stressed out, your baby will sense your stress and may become agitated. This can make breast feeding even more difficult and start a vicious cycle.

, Good posture is important. Always bring baby up to your breast to prevent strain on your back. Place a pillow on your lap to support the baby and your arms while you hold her up to your breast.

Leave any leftover milk on your nipples after nursing.,
Pat your nipples gently with a soft cloth when you do not have time to let them air-dry.,
Change your bras frequently.,
Keep cleansers such as shampoo and soap off of the nipples.,
Treat dry and cracked nipples with breast-feeding ointments.",How to Use Different Breast Feeding Positions5," Allow the nipples to air-dry naturally. Refrain from wiping them off, as this can irritate the nipples and lead to discomfort. Breast milk has healing properties that are anti-fungal, anti-bacterial and anti-viral. Allowing some milk to air-dry on your nipples after each feeding can protect them from invading germs.

, Avoid using abrasive fibers; over time this can lead to nipple irritation and discomfort.

, Milk often leaks out of your nipples throughout the day. Even with the use of breast pads to collect leaky milk, your bra can become wet and soiled. Breasts covered in bras that are wet with breast milk are more susceptible to infection, so it is important to wash your bras often.

, When showering, do not use soap on your nipples. Instead, simply rinse them off with warm water.

, There are many all-natural ointments that are designed for breast-feeding mothers and are completely safe to use during pregnancy. Many do not even have to be washed off before nursing. If you have any doubts about the safety of a particular ointment, check with your doctor or pharmacist.

When does the milk need to arrive?
How long can it take to get there?
Does the company accept milk packed with dry ice? If so, in what quantity?;
, If you are going to ship breast milk, make sure it is fresh. Either pump it immediately before mailing, or remove the correct amount from the freezer.

, You can either use bags made specifically for storing breast milk, or you can use glass or BPA-free plastic containers. If you use glass or plastic containers, wash them with warm, soapy water, then rinse well. Dry them, and then fill them with milk.


Label each container clearly with the date that you pumped the milk.

, Make sure the cooler is not damaged or broken, and check to see that the lid closes well. If the ice melts, the breast milk won’t be safe to drink.

, If you are using regular ice, simply cover the cooler’s bottom evenly. For dry ice, wear gloves and use a hammer to break it up before you spread it into the cooler.


For short trips, you can also use frozen gel packs. If you choose to use these, follow the manufacturer’s instructions, and make sure they are completely frozen.

, Whether you use bags or containers, arrange them neatly over the ice. If you are packing milk that has been pumped at different times, put the oldest milk on the bottom and the freshest milk on top.

, Whether you are using ice, dry ice, or gel packs, cover the milk by filling the cooler the rest of the way.

, Make sure the cover is completely closed, and apply adhesive tape to make sure it will not open.

, Place the cooler in a box, and, if necessary, fill excess space with packaging paper or crumpled newspaper. This will prevent the cooler from moving around too much inside the box.

, Close the cardboard box with adhesive tape to make sure it will not come open during transport. Label with stickers reading “Perishable – breast milk” on the top side of the box. Ship according to the terms of transport.

Use a nipple shield if the baby is having difficulties in latching on.,
Wear a nipple shield if you have flat or inverted nipples.,
Use a nipple shield if you have a skin infection or disease.,
Avoid using a nipple shield if your baby is not experiencing any problems with breastfeeding.",How to Use a Breastfeeding Nipple Shield1," The breastfeeding nipple shield was designed initially for an infant who is having difficulties in latching, or the act of grasping and sucking the mother’s nipples and lower areola area. It is important that the baby latches on to achieve maximum breastfeeding potential without friction or other complications., The breastfeeding nipple shield is can also be used if you have flat or inverted nipples. These sort of nipples make it very challenging for a baby to latch on.

, The shield also provides protection to the infant in case you have a skin diseases such as psoriasis or eczema, especially in the latching area.


Using a nipple shield can help prevent the transfer of any of the aforementioned skin diseases from the mother to the infant.

, Some professionals believe that you should not use a nipple shield if you are not experiencing any of the problems listed above. They hold that the nipple shield will allow your child to get used to a firm nipple which may cause the infant to become confused when you try to feed him with your real nipple.This disorientation that can occur is called nipple teat confusion.
The recommended length of time that you should use a nipple shield is generally only 14 to 30 days.

Consider how long you're going to be nursing.,
Look into fit and shape.,
Decide whether or not you want fastening straps.,
Make sure it's easy to clean.",How to Use a Breast Feeding Pillow1," A breastfeeding pillow is a somewhat long-term investment. If you enjoy using it, and it works well for you and your baby, you will be using the pillow until you're finished breastfeeding. Keep this in mind when selecting your pillow.


Some mothers only breastfeed for 3 or 4 months. In this case, you may not need to worry about the length and size of the pillow. A baby in that age range should fit on most breastfeeding pillows without much trouble.Some women choose to breastfeed longer. If you intend to breastfeed your child for a couple of years rather than a couple of months, go with a larger sized pillow that can support a bigger child. However, as a baby gets older he'll be able to hold his head up and control motor functions more easily. A pillow might not be necessary for support as you get past a year old.;
, Your baby is not the only factor when selecting a breastfeeding pillow. You also need to keep in mind your own size and shape to make sure the breastfeeding pillow fits your body.


Many breastfeeding pillows are designed to strap around your torso so the pillow can support the baby's head and neck when you breastfeed. Try to select a pillow that will fit your midsection shortly after birth. It's helpful to imagine yourself 5 to 6 months pregnant, as this is a good gauge of the size you'll need.Breastfeeding pillows come in different shapes: ""c"" shape, ""o"" shape, and the crescent shape. The ""c"" shape tends to be the most universal shape and generally fits the most body types while providing adequate arm support.O-shaped pillows wrap around the entire body, which can be good if your need extra support after pregnancy due to complications or a c-section.Crescent shapes are designed to wrap around the side of your body. They might not work as well for smaller women as the sides might fall on the back of the chair, sofa, or wherever you're sitting. Some crescent shaped pillows, however, are adjustable and can be maneuvered to fit multiple sizes., Fastening straps are a popular addition to breastfeeding pillows. They are buckled straps that allow the pillow to fit closest around your body.


The main pro of fastening straps is that they keep the pillow more secure. This makes breastfeeding less disruptive. You can also use the straps to pull the baby closer to your body.The biggest drawback of fastening straps is the difficulty of getting them on and off. Breastfeeding is unpredictable. Your baby could have issues, such as spitting up. Other children or pets could need attention, resulting in you needing to walk away from breastfeeding for a moment. The presence of straps could delay your response time to any issues that occur., Breastfeeding pillows get dirty easily. Babies spit up or have other accidents that causes debris to gather. Find a pillow that's easy to clean.


The easiest breastfeeding pillows to clean have covers that can be removed and then machine washed and dried.Some breastfeeding pillows come with foam inserts that can be hand washed and then laid out to dry.Materials used also play a factor in the ease of cleaning your pillow. Sometimes, organic materials can be harder to clean. However, if you feel more comfortable with pesticide free padding and fabrics know you might have to take time to hand wash your pillow."

You can store your milk in plastic bags or freezable bottles--two to four ounces is best for each container., The composition of your breast milk changes as your baby gets older, so don’t use breast milk more than four months old. Labeling your milk will help you make sure your baby is getting the best milk for his or her developmental stage., Store new milk in the back of the freezer. That way, the first portion you use is always the oldest., Make it part of your nightly routine to take the next day’s portion of milk out to thaw.

, Make sure the cooler is not damaged or broken, and check to see that the lid closes well. If the ice melts, the breast milk won’t be safe to drink.

, Spread regular ice over the bottom of a clean cooler. Do not use dry ice. When it melts, it emits poisonous carbon dioxide that you will be in contact with each time you open the cooler. Dry ice should be used for shipping only.

, Whether you use bags or containers, arrange them neatly over the ice. Pack it in such a way that you use the oldest milk first.

, Leave the cooler closed during your trip so that the ice does not melt. You should be able to count on the milk staying frozen for four to six hours.

, If the milk has thawed, you must use what you can immediately and get rid of the rest. If it is still frozen, you can put it in a freezer right away.

Choose a nipple shield of the correct size and shape.,
Make sure the nipple shield is not too long or too loose.,
Ensure that you do not have an allergic reaction to certain materials.,
Place a couple of drops of breast milk into the cup area of the nipple shield.,
Place the lower half of the shield under the nipple and areola.",How to Use a Breastfeeding Nipple Shield2," Your infant will most likely not get the milk that he needs if you do not choose the correct nipple shield. Factors to keep in mind include:


As there are different breasts and nipple sizes, the breastfeeding nipple shield also comes in a variety of sizes to fit most women. The breastfeeding nipple shield is shaped like a breast and is transparent. In choosing the proper size, the nipple shield should mimic the mother’s nipple.
To determine the correct size, place the nipple shield directly on top of your breast and make sure that your nipple can fit into the shield’s cup area. The nipple shield should feel like a part of the breast.

, The nipple shield should not be loose, and the length of the nipple shield should be longer than the area of the breast it is attaching to.


If the length of the nipple shield is long, it can cause unpleasant consequences for your infant such as gagging or difficulties in attachment. This is because the excess nipple shield might topple down on your infant’s face during feeding, making it hard for your child to get any milk.

, As there are many brands of nipple shields out on the market, you should try different ones if you are concerned that one brand may cause you to have an allergic reaction.


Common allergies include rubber, soft latex, or silicone. Make sure that you are not allergic to any of these, or that the nipple does not contain these materials if you are allergic to them.

, Once a breastfeeding nipple shield has been chosen, the next step is to fit and place the shield properly before starting breastfeeding.


Put a couple of drops of breast milk, or express, into the nipple shield’s cup area. Doing this ensures that there is breast milk coming out of your breast. Doing this also helps to make sure that the milk can pass through the holes of the nipple shield.

, After checking for the patency of the breastfeeding nipple shield, place the lower half of the nipple shield under your nipple and areola area.


After this, pull the other half of the nipple shield up, crossing your nipple to the top part of the areola, making sure that the nipple is in the center of the shield. By doing this, you can make sure that the whole area covered is sealed, maximizing breast milk transfer and preventing chafing.
Keep in mind that most nipple shields will still allow your infant’s face, nose and chin to touch your skin.

Ensure that the baby’s hip, shoulder and ear are aligned.,
Form a C-shape with your hand and hold your breast.,
Guide the nipple into your baby’s mouth.,
Allow the baby to latch onto the nipple shield.,
Understand that breastfeeding with a nipple shield will take longer than normal.",How to Use a Breastfeeding Nipple Shield3," After putting on the breastfeeding nipple shield, the next step is to position your infant properly. Proper positioning and latching is as important as placing the nipple shield on correctly.


If your infant is not positioned properly, the sucking mechanism may not be enough for your infant to get milk and will require more force from your infant to suck, which consequently makes your infant tired and hungry.
If your infant is too far or too low or too high from your nipples, your nipples may get sore because they will be forced to stretch while your child has to suck harder.

, By doing this, your infant will be at a level where he is not too low or too high for your breasts. This position is also more likely to be comfortable for you because you will not have to carry your infant high up on your arms.Remember to bring your infant towards you as you place your infant’s head near your breast. Do not move towards your infant as this will cause excess strain on you. Remain in an upright position.

, Once you are positioned stomach to stomach and you are sitting in an upright position, make sure that your infant’s hip, shoulder, and ear are aligned.This will help your baby to swallow more easily.


Check that your infant’s nose is opposite your breastfeeding nipple. This position will allow for easier latching.

, Next is guiding the infant to your breasts. Once your infant’s nose is aligned with your breastfeeding nipple, you should form your right hand (if using the left nipple, or left hand if using the right nipple) into a C shape that fits snuggly into the side of your breast.


By holding the breast in a C shape, you will not be interfering with the already positioned head and body of your infant. Also, by using a C shape to grasp your breast, you will not be touching the nipple and disrupting the nipple shield.

, While you are in the C grasp position, you can now move the nipple closer to your infant’s nose or upper lip. Do not move it towards the center of your baby’s mouth.


Moving the nipple directly into the center of your baby’s mouth does not ensure that his mouth will open. Rubbing the nipple against your infant’s top lip will make your infant more likely to open his mouth.
Once the infant has opened his mouth, place the nipple inside it ensuring that the lower areola is also included.

, Once properly latched in place, the next step is to check the infant’s “latch” to the breastfeeding shield. Your infant’s mouth should not be close to the edge of the nipple but should be taking in as much of the breastfeeding nipple shield as possible. This will ensure that your infant will be able to suck as much breast milk as he can.


The infant will stop feeding on his own when there is no more breast milk or when he is full.

, Using a nipple shield takes longer than breastfeeding without one because the infant will need to forcefully suck more than necessary because the nipple shield is a bit tougher than your natural nipple.


After feeding, ensure that the breasts are adequately drained of milk as well to avoid breast engorgement by manually pressing the breasts. If there is still milk, a breast pump might be required to manually drain the breasts of milk.

Wash the nipple shield thoroughly after use.,
Dry the shield thoroughly, then store it in an airtight container.,
Sterilize the nipple shield if you or the baby has been sick.",How to Use a Breastfeeding Nipple Shield4," Caring for the nipple shield is also important. After use, the nipple shield should be rinsed with cold water and then washed with a mixture of hot water and soap. After using the hot water and soap, rinse it with cold water again.Take note that you should not put soap directly on the nipple shield. Instead, fill a basin with hot water and then add soap to it, mixing it thoroughly. This is important to remember because when soap is placed directly on the nipple shield, it could compromise the integrity of the shield. The soap could be ingested by your infant, making him sick.
This process will help eliminate dirt and grime.

, The nipple shield should be dried. To do this, pat it down with a fresh, clean cloth and then store it in a container that is sealed and airtight. This will ensure that no bacteria or virus will get on it.


It also means that there will be no need to clean it before you feed your child next time.

, If you have been sick, or your child has been sick, boil the nipple shield in hot water and soap for two to three minutes. This will help to eliminate any lingering bacteria or viruses.

Decide how you'll sit while feeding your baby.,
Use a breast feeding pillow while breast feeding.,
Try using the pillow for bottle feeding.",How to Use a Breast Feeding Pillow2," How you use the pillow depends on how you position your body during breastfeeding. Choose a position that provides you and your child the most comfort.


Some women choose to breastfeed while lying back, or on their side, which is a popular position for breast feeding. You can cuddle the baby by laying him across your chest or stomach to feed him, or have him lay right next to you on a bed or sofa. A breastfeeding pillow might not be necessary if you use one of these positions.If you breastfeed while sitting on a chair or sofa, with the baby lying across your lap, the breastfeeding pillow is particularly useful. It can support the baby's head and neck while you breastfeed.Many women tuck the baby under their underarm for support and breastfeed from the side. Some kind of pillow is usually necessary in such cases. A breastfeeding pillow, especially a crescent shaped pillow, can help with such feedings., When you sit down to breastfeed, regardless of the position and pillow type you chose, make sure your breastfeed with you and your baby's safety in mind.


Place the breastfeeding pillow along the arm, lap, or side of your body where the baby will be seated during feeding.Gently, take your baby and place his feet under your arm, facing your back. Position him so his tummy is facing your body.Ease your baby down onto the breastfeeding pillow. The pillow will do some work for you in regards to supporting your baby.Make sure your baby is positioned on his side with his tummy facing you. Improper positioning could lead to gastric reflux or difficulty swallowing., If you're weaning your baby, or your partner also feeds the baby, you can also safely use the breastfeeding pillow when bottle feeding.


Find a comfortable place to sit and position the pillow on your lap or side. Lie with whichever arm you're using to support the baby's head on the pillow.When bottle feeding, your baby should be lying on a slight incline. His head should be tilted upward slightly.While you'll need to use your arm to keep the baby from wriggling too much, the pillow will still provide some support and take some of your baby's weight off of you."

Use a breastfeeding pillow during pregnancy.,
Add a breastfeeding pillow to tummy time.,
Understand the pillow is not for everyone.",How to Use a Breast Feeding Pillow3," If you purchase a breastfeeding pillow before your baby arrives you can use it to provide relief from pains and discomforts during pregnancy.


Tucking the breastfeeding pillow between bent knees during sleep offers lower back support. You can also tuck the pillow behind your back to help you stay on your side while sleeping.If you have pregnancy related heartburn, you can use an extra pillow to raise your head while sleeping., Tummy time is a routine in which a baby is placed on his tummy for a little bit each day. The purpose of tummy time is to strengthen a baby's neck muscles and teach him how to push, roll over, crawl, and stand. Breastfeeding pillows can be used to enhance tummy time.


Most baby's sleep on their backs, in accordance to standards laid out by the American Academy of Pediatricians in 1992. This is to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. As babies spend so much time on their backs rather than their stomachs, tummy time can be stressful. Babies might resist being forced on their stomach.A breastfeeding pillow can help ease your baby into tummy time. Propping a baby up on a pillow can give him a new perspective and allow him to see more of a room. This can distract him from the discomfort of being on his belly, and prevent crying and distress during tummy time.Make sure you don't prop your baby up using a breastfeeding pillow before 3 or 4 months, as his neck muscles might not be strong enough for this to be safe until then., Breastfeeding pillows can be a great tool, but they do not work for every mother.


Sometimes, a breastfeeding pillow can result in your baby having difficulty latching. Some babies do not take to breastfeeding and prefer to be held, resulting in them becoming fussy or difficult to nurse when using the pillow.Nursing pillows are bulky and can be difficult to take from place to place. Some others also report having to lean over the pillows and experiencing back aches because of this.Remember, a nursing pillow is designed to provide you added comfort. Some women find the pillow to be helpful to them and their babies, but if a breastfeeding pillow causes you discomfort it's not a necessity. Old fashioned breastfeeding is fine if you don't feel comfortable with a breastfeeding pillow.

Recognize that hormonal changes during weaning can affect your mood.,
Get support if you need it.",How to Stop Breastfeeding Quickly," Before weaning you must ensure that your baby will have an adequate diet without breast milk, which will vary depending on their age.


A baby under the age of one will need to transition to formula for the majority of their calories. Babies under the age of one need about fifty calories per pound of body weight every day,and because they cannot digest cow's milk, they will need to get this nutrition from a commercial infant formula available at any grocery store.
While babies older than six months can begin experimenting with solid foods like infant purees, remember ""food before one is mainly for fun.""Solid foods before the age of one generally do not provide many calories and are not enough to meet your baby's nutritional demands.
After the age of one, you can transition your baby directly to whole cow's milk and solid food, provided they have become adept at eating solid foods and have a varied diet. A toddler between the ages of one and two needs about 1,000 calories a day spread between three small meals and two small snacks. About half of those calories should come from fat (primarily through dairy milk, cheese, yogurt, butter, etc.) and the other half from proteins (meat, eggs, tofu), fruits, veggies, and whole grains. ;
, Babies eat every few hours, so your baby will need something immediately available to replace your breast milk.


If you must stop breastfeeding immediately, having a variety of options available for your baby might help ease the transition.
If your child is under one and has not had formula, consider purchasing several varieties of formula (and baby food, if they are over age six months). Ask your pediatrician for recommendations, but remember that formula acceptance can be trial and error for babies who have not had it before. Each type has a slightly different taste, and some can be gentler on your baby's stomach than others, or have a more or less pleasant flavor, so your baby may tolerate one better than another.
If your baby is one or older, purchase whole cow's milk. If you have reason to think your child may have a sensitivity or allergy to cow's milk, you will need a milk substitute that provides enough fat, protein, and calcium for a toddler's developmental needs. Consult your pediatrician, and discuss whether you might try goat's milk or full-fat soy milk with added calcium, both of which are available at most grocery stores., A child may resist weaning and may be hesitant to accept a bottle or sippy cup from their mother, because they associate her with nursing. It helps to have other trusted adults to offer bottles or food during this transitional period.


Ask the baby's father or another trusted adult that the baby knows well to offer bottles or sippy cups. Many babies refuse a bottle from their mother, but will accept it from someone else since they do not associate this other person with nursing.
If a child is accustomed to eating during the night, ask the baby's father or other adult to take care of night time feedings for a few nights.
Having a friend, parent, or grandparent stay with you can be helpful during this time period. Your baby may become frustrated by your presence, and there may be times when you might find it helpful to leave the room or even run an errand to give the baby a break.

, Young babies or those who have not yet learned to drink from a bottle or sippy cup are especially vulnerable to malnutrition during the transition period.


Watch the level on the side of the bottle or sippy cup to ensure that the baby is taking in adequate amounts during each feeding.
If the baby cannot suck or figure out how to latch onto a bottle or sippy, you will need to try a medicine dropper or cup feeding. Cup feeding can be hard with very small infants, but it is possible with patience., Very young babies will not understand weaning, but older babies and toddlers tend to understand words before they can speak and may be able to comprehend simple explanations of weaning.When the baby reaches for the breast, say ""Mommy doesn't have any milk. Let's go get some milk,"" and then proceed to take the baby immediately for a bottle or sippy cup.
Be persistent in your explanations. If you say you don't have milk, don't give in and offer to suckle the baby. This will confuse the baby and prolong the process.
Older toddlers can benefit from redirection when they ask to nurse. ""Mommy doesn't have any milk anymore. But Daddy has some milk. Go ask Daddy for milk,"" can be a good distraction for a mobile toddler, who can then go find Daddy and ask for a sippy cup of milk. Toddlers who typically nurse for comfort rather than because they are hungry might need a different type of distraction. Try taking them outside or finding a toy they haven't played with in a while to distract them.

, Weaning is often an emotionally and physically challenging time for infants and toddlers, and they may not behave like themselves for several days.


Remember that breastfeeding provided more than just nutrition to a baby: it also provided one-on-one cuddling time several times every day. Be sure that the baby receives extra cuddling and attention during the transition, which is crucial to a young child's emotional and social development and feelings of safety and belonging. This will help them feel secure and know that the lack of breastfeeding does not mean a lack of affection or security.
Interruptions in sleep are common, especially if the baby is used to nursing before naps or bedtime. Be persistent but patient.
If your baby is clingy and you find your patience is growing thin, take a break. Ask a trusted friend to stay with your baby and take a shower or go out for a coffee. If you feel very overwhelmed, place the baby in a safe place like a crib and close the door. Take a few minutes to breathe deeply and calm down. It's always ok to step away and take time for yourself.

, Drying up a full supply of milk suddenly can be a lengthy process, with about a week before you are comfortable again and up to a year before your breasts completely stop producing milk (though by that point it will be very minimal).The process can be painful, with engorgement pain similar to the beginning of nursing when your milk first came in. It might help to take some ibuprofen or acetaminophen for your discomfort.

, A high-impact sports bra can help to compress the breasts and slow milk production, but be careful that it is not too tight.


A bra that is too tight can cause plugged milk ducts, which can be very painful.Wear a bra no tighter than you would wear for sports.
Similarly, avoid underwire bras, as the wire can also lead to plugged ducts.

, Avoid letting the water beat directly on your breasts and keep the water temperature warm, not hot.


The warmth of water can cause your milk to let down and stimulate more milk production.

, Cabbage is known to help dry milk, although there has not been enough research to understand why.Wash the leaves and insert into your bra, directly against the skin. You can use them chilled or room temperature.
Leave the leaves in your bra until they begin to wilt, and replace with fresh leaves. You can continue this process as needed until you are finished drying up your milk.
Alternately, you can try ice packs for pain.

, Expressing milk with a pump or manually can stimulate more production, but it is sometimes the only way to relieve the pain of engorgement.


Wait as long as you can and squeeze out only enough to relieve the pressure. Try manually expressing a bit by gently squeezing your breast with your full hand just above the areola.

, There is no evidence than any medications, supplements, or herbs can be used to dry the milk supply any faster. There may be anecdotal evidence that a decongestant helps during weaning, but there is no scientific proof to back this up. Talk to your doctor if you wish to try this — it is likely not going to harm you, but it is unlikely it will actually cause your milk supply to dry any faster.


Many women have relied on herbs like sage, jasmine, and peppermint to aid in drying up their milk supplies. Be sure to talk to your doctor about these options and, again, remember that there is no proof they will have any effect.

, They will become heavy and sore and you will likely be uncomfortable.


The feeling of engorgement can be very painful — your breasts will feel tender, bruised, and very firm — and can last for two to three days. If your breasts become warm to the touch or if you see red streaks, or if you develop a temperature greater than 100.4°F (38°C), contact your doctor immediately because you may have an infection.You may also experience a plugged milk duct, which frequently occurs when nursing stops abruptly due to engorgement. A plugged duct feels like a hard knot in the breast and is tender to the touch. Plugged ducts should be treated by using warm compresses and gentle massage on the lump. See your doctor if it does not improve in a day; it might indicate an infection., Leaking is common during the weaning process, especially after you have missed a couple of feedings and your breasts become engorged.


You may find that the sound of your baby crying or even just thinking about your baby will cause your breasts to leak. This is normal and will not last more than a few days.
Purchase nursing pads from the store to absorb any unexpected leaks.

, Nursing burns extra calories, so unless you also cut back on your calorie intake, you will gain weight when you wean your baby.


Because weaning can be hard on your body, it's best to begin reducing calories gradually rather than to go on a drastic diet right away.
If you want to continue taking in as many calories as you did while you nursed, you will need to increase your activity level to burn off those calories.

, It may take the body several weeks or longer to totally return to the pre-pregnancy state and until it does, your hormones may be out of balance.


For some women, feelings similar to postpartum baby blues are common. This can include feelings of irritability, anxiety, and weepiness and a general down feeling. Sometimes these feelings can lead to depression.Contact your doctor if you don't feel like yourself.

, Weaning can be difficult physically and emotionally and you may need someone to talk to.


Talk to a friend or lactation consultant about the weaning process and what you are experiencing. Sometimes just hearing that your experience is normal can be reassuring.
Consider contacting the La Leche League International for additional help and support. Their website http://www.llli.org/ is easy to understand and can be an excellent resource for mothers trying to wean.
If at any time you feel helpless or hopeless, or if guilt or anxiety becomes overwhelming, call 911 for immediate support or schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss options to manage your anxiety.

Start by looking at your parenting books, talking to your doctor, searching the internet, and talking about night weaning with your family and friends. All babies are different, and there are many methods for stopping breastfeeding at night. This will help you get an idea of what to expect!


Keep in mind that you may also have to pay attention to your baby’s cues to find the best way to stop breastfeeding at night. For example, if you usually wake your baby up to do a nighttime feeding, then you might start to skip this when the baby is sleeping.;
, In order to wean the baby off of breastfeeding at night without sacrificing needed nutrients, start nursing more during the day. If you usually breastfeed every 3 hours, you can try nursing every two hours instead. This will help to fill the baby’s belly up during the day and reduce nighttime hunger.However, keep in mind that if your baby is not hungry, then he probably won’t want to eat, so trying to feed more during the day may end up being more frustrating than anything else.

, Some babies need to breastfeed so much at night because they are too distracted during daytime feedings to take in enough milk. Studies have even shown that babies older than 6 months take in 25% of their daily intake at night due to distractibility during daytime feedings.Some tips for minimizing daytime distractions:


Nurse in a quiet, dark room with the door closed and the blinds pulled down.
If you have older children or pets in the house, be sure they are not in the room while you nurse.
Try nursing lying down, which can be a more relaxing position for both mother and child.
Either nurse in silence or talk in quiet, soothing tones.

, In order to help increase feedings during the day, it is important to keep an eye out for clues your baby is hungry. Many breastfeeding experts advise that an initial pulling away is not an indication that the baby is done feeding.Rather than assuming that your baby is finished, try coaxing him back onto the breast a few more times to be sure.

, It is typically recommended to introduce solid foods around 6 months, which is also when moms often begin weaning their babies off of breastfeeding.Depending on your baby’s age, start by replacing one breastfeeding session with either a single formula bottle or solid food. Some babies do well with food, such as cereal in a bottle, before bed while others do not. See how your baby reacts to food before bed, and if it works, then continue with it.

, In the early evening hours, “tank up” your baby by nursing at least every 1 to 2 hours. This will fill your baby’s tummy with milk and nutrients, and a full tummy typically means a sleepy baby. It is also recommended that you only nurse on one breast during these feedings so that the baby gets milk with a higher fat content, which helps the baby go longer between feedings., It seems counterintuitive, but many babies have a hard time going to sleep if they are overtired. Look for signs of sleepiness in your baby, and begin settling him in early on. Dress him comfortably so he doesn't get too hot or too cold, and change his diaper to a nighttime diaper. Be sure to keep the atmosphere relaxed and soothing during this time. Some signs your baby is getting sleepy:Loss of typical coordination
Yawning
Rubbing eyes or nose
Pulling ears or hair
Fussing or whining

, Sometimes called “dream feeding,” nurse the baby right before you go to bed even if the baby is already asleep. This usually takes place in the time between getting the baby ready for bed and when he is deeply asleep and actually put down. Breastfeeding the baby one last time while you are holding him in your arms or in a sling will fill their stomachs and help increase the amount of time you have to sleep before he wakes up again., Especially if you have introduced solid foods into their diet, a baby doesn’t need mid-night feedings, they want them. Your baby wants to be held and rocked back to sleep more than they want to eat, so try using other forms of comfort besides feeding:If you have a partner, get them involved in the bedtime routine. Having your partner put the baby to bed will help your baby associate sleep and comfort with someone else besides you.
Feed your baby a bottle with just a few ounces of water in it.
Give your baby a pacifier to suck on. This suckling motion is extremely comforting to babies even without getting any milk.
Give your baby a comfort item like a teddy bear.

, When your baby wakes up in the middle of the night wanting comfort, it is important to deter breastfeeding with your clothing as well. Cover up and wear clothing that makes it harder for your baby to access your breasts while you comfort him. If the baby cannot find the nipple quickly, most will often just fall back to sleep., Sometimes the distance between the baby and mother can affect their nighttime waking patterns. If your baby is still having difficulty not being breastfed at night even with the other techniques, try other sleeping arrangements until you find one that works for you and the baby.Co-sleeping is discouraged by many pediatricians, so you may want to steer clear of this. However, you can try moving your baby’s crib into your room for a few nights to see if this helps with weaning.

, It is important to remind yourself that sleeping through the night is a developmental milestone that different babies will reach at different times. Weaning a baby off of breastfeeding at night will take time and a lot of patience. Stick to your daytime and nighttime routines as much as possible and you will start to see results eventually!

, You are closing a chapter of your life together, and this can result in some feelings of sorrow. Seeing your baby in distress over being weaned off nighttime breastfeeding can also cause you to feel guilty for making him experience this anguish.Expect to feel frustrated, angry, and sad from time to time as the changes occur.

, As you start breastfeeding less and less, it is possible that you may have some breast discomfort. If this happens, gently massage the entire breast area in slow, circular motions. If you see or feel any lumps or have areas that are especially sore, you may have a clogged milk duct and should contact your doctor., If your breasts become engorged or leak significantly at night, try pumping the breast milk that is no longer being consumed during nighttime feedings. Be sure to only pump enough milk to prevent discomfort; pumping too much milk will trick the body into producing even more milk to compensate., Sleep in a firm, well-fitting bra to help with any discomfort that may occur during the evening. Refrain from sleeping in a bra that has an underwire, but also be sure the bra you are wearing is fitted enough to give you some support. If leakage becomes an issue during the night, place a nursing pad in your bra for extra absorption.

, Weaning your baby off of breastfeeding at night helps your baby get more sleep, but it also helps you get more sleep during these breaks too. This is equally important, with some studies even indicating a relationship between sleep deprivation in mothers and postpartum depression.In order to maximize sleep for everyone, be sure that you go to bed soon after putting the baby down at night. And enjoy the longer periods of sleep!

Decide on a breastfeeding replacement.,
Decide whether to wean the baby from the bottle.",How to Stop Breast Feeding1," When you're ready to stop breast feeding, you need a suitable substitute that is nutritious enough to meet the baby's needs. Seek guidance from your pediatrician about foods that will ease the baby's transition from breastfeeding to eating from a bottle or cup. These options are among those available to mothers who choose to stop breastfeeding:


Continue feeding breast milk that has been pumped. Just because you no longer want to breast feed doesn't mean you have to stop feeding the baby breast milk. This is a good option for mothers who are unavailable to breastfeed the baby but aren't yet ready to stop feeding the baby breast milk.
Replace the breast milk with formula. Ask your doctor about which fortified formula might be right for your baby.
Replace the breast milk with solid food and cow's milk. If the baby is 4 to 6 months old, he or she may be ready to take solid food along with breast milk or formula. Babies over 1 year old may also have cow's milk.;
, In some cases, ending breast feeding is also a good time to wean the baby from the bottle and have him her or use a cup instead. Take the following factors into consideration:

Babies need liquid nutrition in the form of breast milk or formula throughout their first year, but they can start drinking from a cup as early as 4 months.






Babies who drink from the bottle after age 1 may develop tooth decay and other dental issues."

Always wash your hands.,
Express or pump the milk into your chosen containers.,
Label the containers.,
Store the milk in the refrigerator or freezer.",How to Store Your Expressed Breast Milk2," Before you express milk or use a breast pump, wash your hands and the equipment you're using with warm, soapy water to prevent the breast milk from getting contaminated.

, If possible, express or pump the milk directly into the containers you're going to use to store the milk, rather than using a different container in between. Pumping directly into the container you're using to store the milk reduces the chances the milk will get contaminated. When you're finished filling the containers, close the lids tightly.

, It's important to label the containers with the date you pumped or expressed the milk and stored it. If you don't, you may forget when milk was first stored and accidentally reach for spoiled milk one day.

, Breast milk may be safely left on the table or countertop at room temperature for 6-8 hours at a temperature no higher than 77°F, or 25°C. If you're not going to use the milk within that time, it's necessary to store it in the refrigerator or freezer.Breast milk can be safely stored in the refrigerator for 5 days at a temperature of 39°F or 4°C. If you express or pump milk more than once in one day, you can add it to the same container. Store milk expressed or pumped on different days in different containers.
Breast milk can be safely stored in the freezer for 3 - 6 months. Don't add more milk to breast milk that has already been frozen; store it in a different container."

Do the feeding in a new room in the house. Weaning a baby is both a physical and psychological transition. Doing it in a new room can help the baby ease away from associating a particular atmosphere with food.






Give the baby extra comfort and hugs during the feeding to help the transition go more smoothly.

, As the baby grows used to the new style of eating, keep replacing another feeding every two or three days. Don't rush the process too much, or the baby may grow confused and the weaning plan could backfire.

Offer the baby milk or formula in a cup or bottle before every feeding, even those you don't plan to fully replace. Getting the baby used to these alternative feeding instruments is an essential transition step.Shorten the breastfeeding sessions you still have.
Continue replacing and shortening feedings over the course of a few weeks until the baby has switched almost entirely to drinking from a bottle or cup, depending on which one you have chosen to provide.

, For example, many babies breastfeed right before they go to sleep. Start putting the baby to bed without first breastfeeding so that he or she will be able to sleep without this activity.


Replacing breastfeeding with another ritual can help. For example, consider reading a story, playing a game or rocking in the rocking chair before the baby goes to sleep.
Don't replace breastfeeding with an object, like a stuffed animal or pacifier. These items will make the weaning process more difficult for the baby., Babies need the skin contact they get while breastfeeding almost as much as they need the nourishment. It's important to provide extra cuddles during the weaning process."
"
Stick with it.,
Know when to take the baby to a doctor.,
Don't forget to ease your own body's transition.",How to Stop Breast Feeding3," Weaning is a different process for every baby. It may take a few months before the baby is able to take a cup or bottle without complaint. In the meantime, don't give up; stick to the routine you've set up, and continue gradually replacing feedings for as long as it takes.

Know that your baby may need extra comfort when he or she is sick. It's fine to revert to breastfeeding during times like these.
Having the baby spend extra time with a father, older sibling, or another relative can help. As the baby's relationships with other people grow, he or she won't be as reliant on breastfeeding with you to be the sole source of comfort.







, Sometimes the transition from breastfeeding can result in medical complications. If you're not sure whether weaning is the healthiest choice for your child, it's best to see a doctor right away. Look for the following issues that commonly crop up during weaning:


The baby refuses to eat solid food even though he or she is over 6 or 8 months of age.The baby develops dental cavities.
The baby focuses only on you and breastfeeding, and doesn't seem interested in other people or activities., As the baby drinks less breast milk, your breasts will start producing less. However, there may be times when your breasts become uncomfortably engorged or inflamed. Try the following techniques to make yourself more comfortable:



Express a very small amount of milk, either by pump or manually, during missed feedings. Do not empty your breasts, or that will signal your body to make more milk.
Apply a cold compress to your breast 3 or 4 times per day, for about 15 to 20 minutes at a time, if you need some additional relief. This helps relieve inflammation and constricts the milk-producing membranes.

Ensure proper latching.,
Take away all distractions.,
Give the baby your full attention while nursing.,
Clear their nose first if they have a cold.",How to Stop a Breast Feeding Baby From Biting1," Your baby cannot bite when they are properly latched. When in position to feed, gently touch your nipple to your baby’s bottom lip to encourage them to open wide. You can also gently lower their chin to prompt them to open their mouth. Allow them to take your whole nipple and much of the areola in their mouth.When your baby is latched properly you shouldn’t get a pinching feeling on your nipple. Rather you should experience a slight pulling feeling on your breast.;
, Some babies who bite while nursing cannot concentrate on eating when there are various things to look at or listen to in the room. Go to a dark, quiet room so that the baby can focus on eating, rather than biting out of excitement or anxiety., Some babies bite to get their mother's attention as they nurse. Avoid biting by talking to your baby while feeding, touching them, and making lots of eye contact., Sometimes a baby will bite if they are sick and their nose is congested, because it’s hard for them to breathe. Clear your baby’s nose with a bulb syringe before nursing to minimize likelihood of biting."

Consider the time frame.,
Contact a lactation consultant.,
Set aside at least two weeks.,
Build a base of support.,
Quit being so hard on yourself.,
Nurse your baby every two hours.,
Rent or buy an electric pump.,
Take care of yourself.,
Use fenugreek.,

Choose the right time and place.,
Stay calm and patient.,

Apply milk to the nipple.,
Supplement with formula.,
Consider using a supplemental nursing system.,
Gradually decrease the amount of formula.",How to Relactate," Your odds of success mostly depend on how old your baby is and how long it's been since you initially stopped breastfeeding. Your genes will also determine how feasible relactating is.


It is easiest to relactate if the process is started within three weeks after the birth of your baby. After that period, prolactin levels drop dramatically. You can still relactate after that window passes, but doing so can prove more difficult.
Babies younger than three months are usually willing to resume breastfeeding, especially if they were breastfed previously. Between three and six months, individual temperament will determine how willing your baby will be. After six months, most babies will not be willing to return to breastfeeding.;
, Contact the hospital you delivered through and ask to speak with a lactation consultant they have on staff there. If the hospital does not employ a lactation consultant, ask for a recommendation.


You can also ask your midwife, your doctor, or your baby's doctor for a recommendation.
Most of the tricks and techniques you can use to relactate are things you can try on your own, but a lactation consultant will usually be able to give you additional advice. This can be especially helpful if you are dealing with unusual circumstances.

, For two full weeks, your main concern should be breastfeeding and stimulating relactation. The entire process might take more time, but you need to keep it your primary focus for at least two weeks if you want to maximize your odds of success.Keep in mind that the amount of time it takes to relactate is usually equal to the amount of time that has passed since you stopped breastfeeding.
Only 50 percent of mothers who successfully relactate establish a full supply within one month. The rest took longer, and some never produced a full supply.

, You will need both emotional and professional help to make it through this difficult process.


Turn to understanding family and friends for emotional support.
If you know anyone who has successfully relactated, ask her for support and advice.
Talk to your doctor, lactation consultant, and other related healthcare professionals for professional support.

, Relactation is not easy and does not work for every woman who tries it. You can do everything right, and the process may still fail. Understand that it is not your fault and that failing to relactate does not, in any way, make you a bad mother.


Ultimately, you need to do what is best for your baby. If you cannot stimulate an ample enough supply of milk or if your baby remains unwilling, that's okay. The “right thing” is simply keeping your baby healthy and providing the nutrition he or she needs, regardless of whether that nutrition comes through breastmilk or formula.

, The most important factor in relactation is physical stimulation. If your baby is willing to latch onto your breast and suck for at least two or three minutes, commit to nursing every two hours.If possible, keep your baby at your breast for 20 to 30 minutes each time.


Offer the breast as a pacifier before your milk comes in. The sucking motion can help stimulate your supply, so as long as your baby is willing, treating your breast as a pacifier can help speed the process along.
Offer the breast before, after, and in between formula feedings, too. Do this regardless of how much formula your baby drinks.
Switch sides. Offer your baby both breasts in equal intervals and for equal periods of time. Doing so stimulates equal milk production in both breasts and can prevent possible health problems.

, You will probably need to stimulate milk production with a fully automatic electric pump kit, especially if your baby is initially unwilling to latch on.


Double pumps are better than pumps that only work on one breast at a time.
Since good electric pumps can be expensive, many mothers opt to rent them. Talk to a hospital, doctor, or lactation consultant about safe, trustworthy breast pump rental options available to you.
Double pump eight times a day. Each session should last 10 to 15 minutes, no matter how much you are able to produce in that amount of time. Any stimulation is better than none.

, Drink plenty of water and get plenty of sleep throughout the entire process. Doing so will keep you healthy and will improve your chances of success.


You need to be fully hydrated if you want to produce sufficient breastmilk. Try to drink eight to ten 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water daily.
Sleep as much as possible and rest when sleep isn't possible. Your body will be less able to make the adjustments it needs to make if you are tired and running on empty.

, Fenugreek belongs to a class of supplements known as galactagogues. Taking fenugreek on a regular basis is a safe, natural way to stimulate milk production. Among milk-stimulating supplements, it also has the highest rate of success.


Fenugreek stimulates your sweat glands. The breast is actually a modified sweat gland, which is part of the reason why fenugreek is believed to be effective.
Take two or three 500 mg fenugreek capsules up to three times daily.Most mothers see a notable increase in milk production within 24 to 72 hours of first use.
Fenugreek tea is not as strong as pill supplements are and tends to be less effective.

, If galactagogue supplements aren't strong enough, you can talk to your doctor about taking a prescription galactagogue medication like reglan or domperidone.Domperidone has fewer side effects and is available in many countries, including Canada and Australia, but it is not available in the United States. If you are able to get a prescription for domperidone, you will need to take 10 mg three times a day. After taking it for a few weeks, this amount will be increased to 20 mg four times a day.
Reglan should be taken three times a day in 10 mg doses. You'll need to decrease the dose gradually to avoid a dramatic drop in milk production. You should also note that taking it for four or more weeks can trigger or worse depression.

, Your baby may be more receptive to resuming breastfeeding if you set the right mood. As a general rule, the baby should feel comfortable and soothed.


Do not wait until the baby is very hungry or very tired. Your baby should be relaxed, even to the point of falling asleep.
Sit in a rocking chair placed in a dimly lit or dark room. Play soothing music. Keep the area free of distractions for both you and your baby.

, Try not to stress out each time you sit with your baby to nurse. If your baby senses your stress, he or she will probably become stressed, too. A stressed baby will have very little interest in nursing.


Keep the experience as pleasant as possible—for yourself and for your baby—so that your baby feels as though breastfeeding is a positive thing.
Staying calm can also make the process easier for you to bear and may increase your odds of success.

, Some studies suggest that increasing the amount of physical contact between you and your baby can encourage your baby to accept breastfeeding while also stimulating your milk supply.


Skin-to-skin contact is especially helpful.
Spend more time cuddling and stroking your baby. Consider sleeping together or bathing together.
Use a sling or a baby carrier to keep your baby close even when you aren't actively nursing.

, If your baby still refuses to latch on, apply a little milk or formula to the nipple and areola. When your baby tastes it, he or she will identify the area as a source of food and may want to latch on.


Before you produce any breastmilk, you can apply formula. After you've succeeded in stimulating some relactation, apply actual breastmilk to the area.

, While you work on building up your milk supply, you will need to continue feeding your baby formula. Do not cut back on the amount of formula you feed your baby until you begin relactating and your baby accepts it.


Use bottles with slow flowing nipples. Liquid flows out of standard bottle nipples quickly, so your baby doesn't need to work very hard to eat. As a result, he or she can become more resistant to the idea of taking milk from the breast, which is more difficult to do.

, A supplemental system will deliver formula to your baby through a soft tube while your baby is nursing at the breast. As a result, your baby gets the food he or she needs while re-associating food with the breast instead of the bottle.


Many babies are willing to work with these supplemental systems because each suck is rewarded with a steady flow of formula.
You will need to wear a container of formula around your neck on a cord. Thin, soft tubes leading from this container will be inserted into your baby's mouth as he or she is at your breast. When your baby sucks, formula from these tubes will flow into his or her mouth.
Note that you can use these systems with both formula and breastmilk.
It is strongly recommended that you receive help from a lactation consultant before using this device since it can be difficult to maneuver at first. If used incorrectly, it can even hurt the baby's mouth., Once your baby begins to breastfeed well, you can start cutting back on the amount of formula he or she receives.


Monitor your baby's weight during the entire process. If he or she is younger than four months, your baby must gain at least 1 oz (28 g) per day before you can safely cut back on formula supply.
After your baby begins breastfeeding well, decrease the amount of formula by 1/2 fl oz (15 ml) in each bottle. Decrease by another 1/2 fl oz (15 ml) the following day. Repeat this pattern until you can eliminate or reduce supplemental formula feeding as much as possible without jeopardizing your baby's health.

Know the symptoms of mastitis.,
Check breasts for any lumps, swelling or areas of heat.,
Take note if you are feeling a bit under the weather.,
Seek the assistance of a medical professional to determine if antibiotics are necessary.",How to Relieve Pain from Mastitis1," Symptoms include pain, soreness, a lump or swelling in the breast. While mastitis can occur at any time during breast-feeding, it's most common within the first month. If symptoms don't show improvement within a few days, see your doctor for treatment.Any discomfort or redness is an indication of a potential problem.
A tingling sensation in the nipple at the start of a nursing session that becomes painful as baby suckles may be the start of mastitis.
Many women who have mastitis think at first that they have the flu.;
, If you notice these conditions, take special precautions to ensure you are receiving proper breast care.Mastitis usually appears within the first four weeks of nursing, though it can occur at any point during breastfeeding, especially when a mom returns to work and is trying to pump, or when she is trying to wean.
Continue to monitor your symptoms. If an improvement is not seen in a few days or if the symptoms worsen, contact your health care provider immediately.

, Mastitis symptoms resemble those of flu. Feeling unusually tired and achy, experiencing chills, having a headache or the presence of a fever are all indications that an infection is more than likely present.This will frequently happen before you experience any symptoms with your breasts.


Stress, fatigue, and being a first-time mother increase your chances of acquiring mastitis.
Remember, mastitis is an illness. Get plenty of rest, and stay hydrated. This will help replenish your immune system.

, Discuss your symptoms with a physician as soon as they develop. Mastitis can rapidly progress into an abscess which can require disfiguring surgery to resolve. Several antibiotics are deemed safe to take while nursing.Continue taking all medications even if you are feeling better. If antibiotics are discontinued before the infection is completely cured, mastitis can come back.
If you don't feel better within 2-3 days of starting antibiotics, contact your medical provider.

Set up a feeding station.,
Try to determine when your baby may be hungry before he or she starts crying and offer the breast at least every two-and-a-half to three hours.,
Go to your comfy spot and breastfeed your crying infant.,
Relax.,
Examine your baby.,
Think about what other things your baby might need.,
Act when your baby has finished feeding.,
Set baby up to be happy.,
Do ""check-ins"".,
Repeat.
",How to Raise a Happy Baby Through on Demand Nursing," Find a comfortable place in the house where you like to breastfeed. Stock it up with the essentials, water, the phone, maybe a book or a notepad. It may be good to have the diaper (nappy) changing station close by.

, If your baby is already crying, respond quickly. From Erick Erickson's Eight Stages of Development, we learn that the first and most important thing your infant learns is ""Basic Trust Versus Basic Mistrust"". Responding quickly to baby will teach baby that the world is a safe place.
, Many new mothers stress over what a crying baby needs; and this is a simple and effective response.
, Watch baby's muscles relax now that baby is feeding. Take inspiration from baby and relax your muscles also. But, you will say, there is more to raising a child then nursing...
, Is baby cold, hot, or in need of a diaper change? Now that your baby is close to you, it is a perfect time to check over his or her physical well-being.
, Does baby want attention, a nap? If so, your job is easy because baby should already be dozing off. While you are still sitting there calm and relaxed, think of what you can do to best help this baby stay happy. Can you carry baby in a sling while you work? Can you sit baby in a bouncy chair where he or she can watch you run about the house and clean it? Can you give baby an interesting object to put in her or his mouth?
, Solve any of these other problems that baby is in need of.
, Maybe attach baby to you with a carrier or a wrap. Maybe put baby in an exerciser or a seat where she or he can watch you work. Place within the baby's view a toy, a kitchen utensil (a whisk works well) or some other daily object that is safe. If you set baby up well, you may be able to get something done while he or she is happy.
, Return any lost toys that cause baby to get upset. If baby is close by where he or she can watch you work, you can catch little problems before they become big. If a toy is dropped you can pick it up before the baby cries and give back to baby before an upset. Check in often with baby. Put your face close to baby so that she or he can see you. Talk to baby and stroke his or her soft little head. This little check-in when the baby is not upset will strengthen baby's confidence and trust in her or his support network.

Choose the right formula.,
Sterilize new bottles.,
Prepare your formula.,
Warm your milk -- if the baby likes it warm.,
Hold your baby the right way.,
Know how often to feed your baby.,
Wash your bottles and nipples after you feed your baby.,
Throw out any leftover formula.",How to Bottle Feed a Newborn," You should choose a formula that is iron-fortified. Though low-iron formulas are available due to the belief that iron makes babies gassy and constipated, this belief has been disproved by studies. The iron-fortified formula will help your baby build strength.Consult your pediatrician if you have any concerns about your baby's health, such as thinking your baby may be lactose intolerant because it runs in your family.
Always check the expiration date on the formula to make sure that you can still use it. Never use expired formula.;
, To sterilize a new bottle, you simply have to submerge it in boiling water. Just make sure that the bottle is not made of plastic.

, Follow the directions for how to mix your formula. If it's a liquid formula, check to see if it needs to be diluted first. Most formulas come in a powder or concentrate form and they need to be mixed with water. Ready-to-feed formulas are available, but they are more expensive.


If you're worried about the safety of your tap water and need to dilute your formula, use bottled water.
Use a clean can opener to open cans of formula. Wash the can opener after every use.
Always wash your hands before you prepare your formula or feed your baby.

, There's no health benefit to warming up your milk, but if your baby likes it, you can do it before it's feeding time. You can heat up the bottle just by placing it in a bowl of warm water or running it under the warm tap.



Never use a microwave to heat a bottle of breast milk or formula. This can create pockets of heat in the milk and may burn your baby.
You can also buy a bottle heater designed for heating bottles.

, You'll have to observe your baby to get a sense of whether or not he or she is comfortable. If you hear a lot of loud sucking noises when he or she is drinking, then he or she may be taking in too much air. To help your baby take in less air, hold him or her at a 45-degree angle. Cradle him or her in a semi-upright position and support his or her head.


Tilt the bottle so the nipple and neck are always filled with milk or formula.

Never prop a bottle. This can cause your baby to choke.

Don't feed your baby when he or she is lying down. He or she can get an ear infection if the formula flows in his or her middle ear.

, In the early weeks of your child's life, you don't need to worry about sticking to a rigid feeding schedule. However, you may start to work out a pattern in the first month or two. First, just focus on offering the bottle to your baby every two or three hours or when your baby seems hungry.Until your baby weights about ten pounds, he or she will typically eat one to three ounces of formula during each feeding.
Don't force your baby to eat when he or she isn't hungry, and don't force him or her to finish the bottle if he or she doesn't want to. As long as your baby still shows interest in feeding from time to time, there's no need to force it.
If your baby continues to suck on the bottle when there's nothing left, that means he or she is hungry. Give him a little bit more to eat.

, You don't have to sterilize your bottles after the first use. Just wash them in the dishwasher if they're dishwasher safe or just wash them in the sink in warm, soapy water.


The nipples can also be washed in a sink full of soapy water.

, Don't put away the formula and use it later. Used formula should not be reused because of potential bacteria growth.

Deal with teething.,
Make sure your baby is getting enough milk.,
Nurse on a regular schedule.,
Know when to end your feeding session.",How to Stop a Breast Feeding Baby From Biting2," Check your baby’s gums for teeth coming through, or watch for other signs of teething such as excessive drooling, swollen gums, and an upswing in fussiness. Deter your baby from biting due to teething by offering them a teething ring, a cold washcloth, or your finger to chew on right before and right after nursing.This will improve their teething pain while teaching them not to use you as a teething toy.

, Some babies bite out of frustration due to lack of milk. If you’re unsure whether they are getting sufficient milk, break their latch and squeeze your nipple to make sure that milk is coming out.If low milk supply is the problem, try to breast-feed often (about every 2-3 hours), be sure to nurse from both breasts, pump your breasts if you miss a feeding, and don’t drink alcohol or use nicotine..
If you’re struggling with insufficient flow, you may have a blocked milk duct. You would probably also feel soreness in the breast, or some swelling.If this occurs, keep feeding from that breast. Try to massage your breast before feeding. If it doesn’t resolve, gets worse, or you develop a fever, see your doctor., Infants eat fairly regularly, usually about every two to three hours, and if you wait too long to feed your baby may be more likely to bite.Every baby is different, so keep on eye out for your infant’s feeding patterns. Watch for signs that your baby is getting hungry, like moving their mouth, making suction motions, crying or becoming restless., You can usually detect signs that your baby is bored, full, distracted, or otherwise ready to stop feeding. Most biting happens at the end of a feed, so take them off your breast if you notice that your baby is showing signs of being done with their feeding. They may get fidgety, clench their jaw muscles, stop feeding for a moment and look around, or other signs particular to your baby."
"
Put your finger in your baby’s mouth when they bite.,
Break the latch with a hug.,
Stop nursing for a few minutes if your baby keeps biting.,
Avoid yelling at your baby when they bite.,
Sternly say ""no"" to your baby when they bite.",How to Stop a Breast Feeding Baby From Biting3," This should break the mouth's grip on the nipple, as well as interfere with feeding. It might feel natural to pull away from pain, but gently inserting a finger into the baby’s mouth will be more comfortable for you. Your baby will learn that their feeding gets interrupted when they bite.

, When removing your baby from your breast, hug them closer in towards your breast rather than pulling them off of you. The baby will briefly not be able to breathe with their face against the breast, forcing them to release your nipple without injury to either of you., This is a negative feedback system, telling your baby that if they bite, they don’t get to nurse.Try nursing again in a few minutes.


Notice that if you stop feeding and your baby doesn’t cry or seems disinterested after a few minutes, they may not need to feed more. This might indicate that they were biting out of boredom or because they were full.

, Do your best to remain calm, and not to cry out or yell at your baby when they bite you. This may scare them away from nursing for a while, or cause them to bite even more out of fear or anxiety. It’s also possible that your baby will enjoy your strong reaction, and it may drive them to bite again out of amusement., While a younger baby might not catch on to this hint, they will eventually understand its meaning, especially if you stop nursing for a few minutes afterward.Consistently tell your baby “no” when they bite and do not let them nurse if they are biting, and eventually they will learn the command and will stop biting without you discontinuing the feeding.

Breastfeed as often as you can, but gently.,
Use hot compresses to reduce swelling and alleviate pain.,
Take analgesics for fever and pain.,
Alternate hot and cold compresses.,
Take warm showers or baths frequently throughout the day.,
Massage the breast prior to feeding the baby.,
Nurse your baby frequently.,
Experiment with a variety of nursing positions.",How to Relieve Pain from Mastitis2," A full breast increases the pain of mastitis, so draining the breast of milk helps reduce pain. Your pain will be less if your breasts are as empty as possible. If breastfeeding is too painful, use a pump.Start each feed on the sore breast. If that's too painful, start with the other breast, and once your milk is flowing well, switch to the affected breast until it feels soft.
If your baby doesn't empty your breast of milk in a feeding, finish by pumping milk until the breast is empty.
Your baby may appear reluctant to nurse on the affected breast. This isn't because anything is different about the milk, but because your breast feels different to the baby. Express a little milk from your nipple to encourage nursing.

, Apply to the affected breast for 15 minutes prior to breastfeeding. This will aid in reducing some swelling and help allow the milk to flow more freely.Use warm towels that are fresh out of the dryer to apply heat.
Also try using warm, wet washcloths.
Repeat this process at least 3 times per day.

, Acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen will help ease pain, without causing complications for your baby. The relief of pain during mastitis aids healing.Aspirin is not recommended. Aspirin has blood-thinning properties that may adversely affect your baby. Aspirin may cause your baby to acquire Reyes' Syndrome, a rare but serious medical condition.
Analgesics that have anti-inflammatory effects, such as ibuprofin, have greater effectiveness than those that don't, such as acetaminophen.

, While warm compresses stimulate breast milk production, cold compresses will help relieve pain between feedings by slowing the milk production. Cold compresses also temporarily numb pain.Damp heat, as in a warm washcloth, will be more effective than a dry heat, such as a heating pad.
Cold compresses can be crushed ice cubes in a plastic bag, with a soft thin towel to protect your skin. A bag of frozen fruits or vegetables also works well. Keep the frozen compress against your breast until it's no longer cold, about 10-15 minutes.

, Massage the affected breast while in the warm water. The warmth of the water increases circulation and helps healing, while massage helps unclog the breast ducts.Stand under the shower stream with the water directed to the affected breast.
Set the temperature of the water to be as hot as you can comfortably tolerate it.
Soaking your breasts in a warm Epsom salt bath speeds healing, and relieves pain.You can also fill up a bowl with warm water and soak your breast in the bowl.

, This will aid in increasing circulation and assist in the milk let-down reflex, which will allow the milk to flow freely. Be sure to massage gently. Rough handling of the breast can increase swelling.With two fingers, find the spot on your breast that hurts the most. Starting here, gently rub in a circular motion. Move first clockwise, then counter-clockwise. Repeat frequently during the day, from differing angles.
Massage will help to release milk that may have built up, clogging your ducts.

, Try to nurse at least every 2 hours. Emptying the breast is the best way to speed up recovery. A full breast will also be more painful, so nursing offers natural pain relief.Wake up your baby throughout the night and from long naps to increase feeding sessions.
Avoid giving baby a bottle. If baby is reluctant to nurse, continue to try periodically. Do not allow yourself to be discouraged if baby does not want to nurse. Just stick with it and continue offering the breast often.

, This will allow pressure to be put on a variety of breast ducts. Incorporate pillows into the feeding sessions for added comfort and pain relief.One suggested position is to crouch above your baby, on your hands and knees. Allow your breasts to hang down freely from your ribcage. Lower your breasts towards your baby's mouth, until she latches on.If you're in public, you can try a modified version. With your baby in your lap, lean over so that your breasts are falling downward. This position drains the ducts more efficiently than any other.

Apply slices of raw potato to the breast within 24 hours of first symptoms.,
Place some raw, chilled cabbage leaves into the cup of your bra.,
Attempt to eat 1 clove of raw garlic daily.,
Take echinacea root tincture.",How to Relieve Pain from Mastitis3," This is a treatment recommended by Bridget Lynch, RM, Community Midwives of Toronto to reduce pain, swelling and redness associated with mastitis.Slice 6-8 raw potatoes lengthwise, and place into a bowl of cold water for 15-20 minutes. Remove a few potato slices from water and place on affected breast.
Allow to remain on the breast for 15-20 minutes, then remove and discard. Repeat with fresh slices.
Continue for 1 hour, for a total of 3 applications. Take a break for about 30 minutes, then repeat the procedure.

, Cabbage leaves have anti-inflammatory properties. This practice is recommended by herbalists as an all-natural remedy to soothe inflammation and assist with flushing the infection from the milk duct.Replace the cabbage leaf every hour.
Some mothers have reported decreased milk production using this method. If your milk slows, discontinue using this treatment.

, Herbalists consider raw garlic to be one of nature’s strongest antibiotics. Peel the clove before eating. Follow with a glass of fresh water, which will help ease the pungent flavor.If you prefer, mince the garlic and combine with butter. Spread this on fresh bread or a steamed vegetable. The garlic will maintain its antibiotic properties while perhaps being more palatable.
Pay attention to the reaction that the consumption of garlic may have on your baby. She may dislike the aroma or flavor that it adds to the milk. Notice if it appears to upset baby’s tummy and if so, discontinue use.

, Echinacea stimulates the immune system, and assists the body in fighting off infection.The recommended dose is 1/2 drop of tincture for every pound of your body weight.Dissolve the tincture in water, or place directly on your tongue.
Recommended dosage is 3-5 applications per day, but some herbalists suggest as many as 12 doses per day.

Eat a healthy, anti-inflammatory diet.,
Include good sources of Omega-3 in your diet.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Avoid compressing the breast with restrictive clothing.,
Drink more water.",How to Relieve Pain from Mastitis4," Avoid sugar and refined food products. Include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains such as brown rice and bulgar wheat.Eat lean protein choices, such as chicken and fish.
Include plenty of spices, such as ginger, curry and tumeric. These spices have anti-inflammatory properties which will help with pain relief.

, Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties, and also contribute to good neonatal brain development.Coldwater fish, such as salmon or cod, are excellent sources of Omega-3. You can also take fish oil supplements.
Flax seeds, walnuts, avocados and other heart-healthy nuts provide Omega-3 as well.

, Rest will boost your body’s infection-fighting power. Ask for help from others if it is difficult for you to find time to rest more.Rest in bed with your baby. This will promote frequent feeding, helping in pain relief. It's also good for bonding with your baby.
Sleep on your back rather than on your stomach to keep from mashing against your breasts. Sleeping on your side is an option, as long as you don't tend to roll too far over, which can constrict your breasts.
Remove your bra before going to bed. If not wearing a bra at all is an option for you, go bra-less for a time.

, Wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothing. Avoid close-fitting shirts or blouses, or any clothing that constrains your breasts.Wear a supportive bra, if you must wear a bra. Underwire bras are not recommended.
If you wear a swimsuit, choose one that isn't too tight.
Avoid clothing that rubs or irritates the nipples.

, Increasing the amount of liquid you drink will help flush toxins from your body, and speed healing.


Drinking water also helps to cool the body's temperature, and provide comfort.
Water can also be used to dilute fruit and vegetable juices."

Know when you need to sterilize.,
Pour water into a pot to boil.,
Separate bottle parts.,
Wash bottles with soap and hot water.,
Place bottles and all parts into the boiling water.,
Remove bottles from the boiling water.,
Use the baby bottle.",How to Sterilize Baby Bottles1," Although it never hurts to be extra clean, sometimes going through the work of sterilization is unnecessary.

Historically, water has never been filtered as much as it is today. That means mothers of the past had to deal with bacteria in the water contaminating their baby bottles. Today, unless you know your water has bacteria in it, you may not need to sterilize it for this reason.
No environment is completely sterile. Therefore, although you may sterilize a bottle, it will likely come in contact with bacteria from your hands, air, counters, etc. Soap and water is often all that is necessary to thoroughly clean a bottle, making further sterilization superfluous.
It is safe to sterilize baby bottles before the first use after purchase from a store, as well as after extended periods of disuse or if your baby was recently ill.;
, You will need to pour enough so that the bottle(s) as well as the nipple(s) are completely submerged., Remove the nipples or tops from their bottles.

, This is to clean any preliminary grime or bacteria that may have found its way onto the bottles. Do this while bringing the pot of water to a boil., The bottles should be completely submerged, and left to soak for at least ten minutes. This allows time for the bottles to be completely cleaned of any remaining bacteria.

, Use metal tongs to grab them and place them to dry upside-down on a drying rack.

, The process of washing and boiling removed any harmful bacteria from the bottles, but being placed back into a natural environment removes any sterility they had. This is fine though, as all homes house bacteria which is important for helping a baby’s immune system to develop. If a bottle is not used immediately, put all the parts back together and store in a covered area to keep from the insides being contaminated."

Request a bag of formula samples and coupons.,
Ask if any additional samples are available.",How to Get Free Baby Formula1," Some hospitals will only distribute formula bags to women who request them, so make it clear that you would appreciate any samples they have, as well as free bottles or coupons.;
, In some cases, hospitals are able to give a few weeks’ supply of infant formula, or multiple sample bags, to women who need or request the extra samples.


Some hospitals don't receive / give out formula samples at the urging of the World Health Organization (WHO), which recommends breast feeding for all newborns. If your hospital says they don't have samples, that's probably why.

Educate yourself about breast care techniques when breastfeeding.,
Check out educational pregnancy and baby websites.,
Identify conditions that can lead to mastitis.",How to Relieve Pain from Mastitis5," Speak with your health care provider or locate a lactation specialist if need be.Don't use soap to clean your nipples, as soap may dry them out. Only clean with water.
Use mild, unscented laundry detergent to wash bras and undergarments.
After breastfeeding, express a small amount of milk and rub it onto the nipple. This will help moisturize and clean your nipple better than breast cream.
If breast cream is necessary, because of dry, chapped nipples, use lanolin.

, These sites have sections geared toward nursing mothers and the conditions that may accompany breastfeeding, including mastitis. Gather as much helpful information as you can from these sources.La Leche League International provides education, support and encouragement to nursing mothers worldwide.
Find a new mothers' group in your area. If there isn't a local group, look online. Many new mothers find support and encouragement through peer groups.
Remember, mastitis is a common condition of nursing mothers. You are not alone!

, Although mastitis can sometimes develop in the absence of any of the following conditions, eliminating these risk factors can help decrease the chance of developing Mastitis, as well as alleviate the condition much quicker.Cracked or bleeding nipples can allow bacteria to enter into the breast. This can occur when your baby fails to latch on properly.
Missed feedings or a longer-than-usual time between feedings can result in breast engorgement. If breast engorgement occurs, milk ducts can become clogged, which increase the risk of developing mastitis.
Stress, poor nutrition and lack of sleep can all lower the body’s ability to fight infection.

Use a dishwasher to clean bottles.,

Unlike boiling the bottles, it does not remove all bacteria though., Wash the bottle parts with soap and water, and place them in the microwave separately. Run for about ninety seconds and allow time to cool., Purchase non-toxic sterilization tablets produced by companies such as Milton and dissolve in a container of cold water. Allow bottles to soak in the water for a minimum of thirty minutes. They can be rinsed when finished, but are safe to use immediately afterwards. "

Sterilize using a travel kettle.",How to Wash Baby Bottles," As soon as you have finished feeding your baby, give the bottle a quick rinse out in the sink.


You can wash the bottle more thoroughly later on when you have time, but this will prevent any old milk or dirt from accumulating in the bottle.
Try to use hot water when rinsing out the bottle, as this will clean more effectively.;
, When cleaning out baby bottles, it helps to use the right materials. Make sure you have:


A bottle brush to help you clean the bottom and sides of the bottle and a nipple brush to clean out the rubber nipple, which is prone to accumulating bacteria.
Dishwashing liquid designed specifically for baby bottles. This is very gentle and non-toxic and will not leave a soapy residue on the bottles.
If you are using plastic baby bottles, make sure that they are free from BPA (bisphenol A), an estrogen-mimicking chemical that was banned by the FDA in 2012., Before you wash your bottles, it's a good idea to clean the sink you intend to use first, to remove any potential bacteria or chemicals.


Use a sponge or scouring pad to scrub down the bottom and sides of the sink and around the plug using hot water. You can use a little baking soda as a natural disinfectant if necessary.
Once the sink is clean and rinsed, fill it with hot water (as hot as your hands can comfortably handle) and dish soap.

, When cleaning baby bottles, it's necessary to take them apart and wash each part -- the bottle, the ring and the nipple -- separately.


This is important as a lot of old milk can build up between the ring and the nipple, leading to the growth of bacteria.
Place all of the bottle parts into the hot, soapy water and wash separately. Use the bottle brush for the bottles and the nipple brush for the plastic nipples and rings., If your bottles are labelled dishwasher safe, you can go ahead and wash them in the dishwasher.Stack the bottles upside-down on the top rack of the dishwasher, away from the heating element.
You can buy special dishwasher-safe baskets for the nipples and rings in baby supply stores.

, After washing, rinse the bottle parts thoroughly in hot running water to remove any bubbles or soap residue.


Place the parts on a bottle drying rack (available at baby supply stores in a range of cute designs).
Make sure the bottles are left to drain in a well-ventilated location to ensure that they dry thoroughly. Bottles that remain damp for too long can grow mold or fungus.

, Once the bottles are dry, remember to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before handling the bottles or feeding your baby.

, Although parents were once advised to sterilize bottles after every use, this is no longer deemed necessary.


According to The American Academy of Pediatrics, washing your bottle with hot, soapy water is enough to effectively clean it -- as long as the water is safe to drink.However, it is still necessary to sterilize new bottles before their first use and to sterilize bottles that have been washed with well water after each use.

, When you need to sterilize your bottles, you can do so using an electric steam sterilizer or a microwave steam sterilizer.


With both types of sterilizer, the bottles are immersed in steam at a temperature of 212 degrees F (or 100 degrees C), which kills off any bacteria.
With the electric sterilizer, you add water, stack the bottles, rings and nipples (spaced well apart), cover with a lid, plug in and turn on. The sterilization process takes approximately 10 minutes.
With the microwave sterilizer, the process is essentially the same. Once the bottles are in the sterilizer, place it in the microwave and heat on full power for 4 to 8 minutes, depending on the wattage of your microwave.

, The old fashioned way of sterilizing bottles simply involved boiling them in a pot of water.


Bring a large pot of water to the boil, then add the bottle parts, cover with a lid and boil for at least three minutes.
This method is best for sterilizing glass baby bottles, but will work on plastic ones too (provided they don't contain BPA).

, The best way to deal with bottle cleaning when travelling is to be prepared.


Carry a small bottle of dish soap and a bottle brush in a sealable plastic bag at all times.
Use disposable bottle liners, so you only have to bring one bottle. The liners can be changed after each feed so the bottle only needs to be washed at night.
If you're staying somewhere with a microwave, bring a portable microwave sterilizer with you when you travel.

, If you're prepared and have your dish soap and bottle brush with you, you can wash the bottles in any available sink.


Just make sure to give the sink a rinse down first, to remove any obvious dirt.
Once washed, place the bottle parts on a clean towel to dry.

, If you've used a sink with water unsafe for drinking, you may need to sterilize bottles while traveling.


As mentioned above, the easiest way to do this is with a portable microwave sterilizer, but if you don't have access to a microwave, you can make do with a travel kettle and a small pair of bottle tongs.
Simply fill the kettle with water, plug it in and allow to boil. Pour the boiling water over the (washed) bottle parts in the sink. Use the tongs to remove the items from the sink and place them on a clean towel to dry.

Mix the rice cereal and formula.,
Serve the rice cereal and formula mixture with a spoon.,
Serve a small amount initially.,
Look for allergy symptoms.,
Avoid arsenic found in rice.,
Introduce another first food.",How to Add Rice Cereal to Formula," Talk to a medical professional before you introduce solid foods.Your physician can verify that your infant is developed enough to handle solid foods. This is the time for you to ask questions and mention any concerns you have about solid foods.


In some cases, your infant's intestinal tract may not be fully developed or your baby may not be able to fullness, leading to potential overfeeding.
Do not give your infant solid foods until your doctor says that is alright.;
, Your infant's digestive system is not ready to process cereal until about 6 months of age. Giving your infant cereal too early increases the chance of choking or inhaling the rice cereal mixture into his or her lungs. Early exposure to cereal can also increase your baby's risk of developing food allergies.Your baby may be ready to try rice cereal at 4 months of age. Your doctor can help you decide what is best for your baby.
It may be alright to introduce rice cereal before 4 to 6 months of age if your baby has reflux issues. Talk to your pediatrician before you try this though.Your baby should also be able to eat from a spoon before you introduce rice cereal to his or her diet.Feeding your baby solid foods too early can cause your baby to become overweight., In addition to being old enough, your infant should meet certain developmental milestones before you introduce cereal. Your infant should be able to sit with support, have head and neck control, push up with elbows from a lying position, place hands or toys in his or her mouth, and lean forward and open his or mouth when hungry or interested in food. If your child is 6 months of age, but has not met these milestones, you may need to delay the introduction of rice cereal.Waiting for these milestones is important. They help ensure that your infant can safely swallow the rice cereal.
Infants also have an extrusion reflex that causes them to raise their tongue and push against objects that are placed between their lips. This reflex is usually gone by 4 to 6 months of age. Trying to spoon feed your child cereal with this reflex can be frustrating and difficult.

, This is typically only done to treat infants with gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Eating cereal from a bottle can make it more difficult for your baby to learn to eat from a spoonand can increase the risk of your baby eating too much and becoming overweight.To reduce reflux, keep your infant upright (i.e. on your shoulder) for 20 to 30 minutes after a feeding.
Try a premixed,""anti-reflux"" formula. These formulas contain rice starch.
Try a hypoallergenic formula that does not contain cow milk or soy milk and see if your infant's reflux improves. Try this for one or two weeks.The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend that you feed your baby rice cereal from a bottle.However, your pediatrician is the best source for deciding if you should feed your baby rice cereal through a bottle.

, Start by adding 1 teaspoon of rice cereal per ounce (i.e. 6 teaspoons) of formula.Prepare the bottle right before you plan to feed your baby. The mixture will continue to thicken if you let it sit.Your doctor may recommend a different ratio of rice cereal to formula.
You can add up to 1 tablespoon of rice cereal to the bottle.

, The bottle with the rice cereal should be your baby's last feeding for the night. This may help your baby sleep longer because the baby's stomach will feel fuller. Cut a larger hole in the nipple of the bottle because the mixture is thicker than formula alone.Don't give your baby rice cereal at every feeding. Rice cereal is mostly carbohydrates and does not provide the same nutrition that formula or breast milk does. Giving your baby rice cereal at every feeding may decrease the amount of nutrients the baby is getting.
You can either cut a small ""x or ""y"""" in the nipple of the bottle or go up to a larger nipple size to accomodate the rice cereal formula., Watch how your baby is swallowing the rice cereal. If the mixture is too thick, your baby will have difficulty getting it down and may become tired during the feeding. Notice if your baby becomes constipated or starts gaining too much weight. These are common side effects of drinking rice cereal.


Adjust the amount of rice cereal you are giving your baby based on your observations.
If the rice cereal makes your baby constipated, you may want to try oatmeal instead.If you are trying to treat your baby's reflux, you should start seeing results in 2 or 3 days. If you see no improvements in that amount of time, rice cereal may not be a good solution for your baby.

, Read the package instructions for preparing the rice cereal. Typically, you add 1 tablespoon (14.78 ml) of rice cereal to every 4 tablespoons (60ml) of formula or breast milk For example, if you are currently feeding your infant 8 tablespoons of formula, you must add 2 tablespoons of rice cereal.


Stir the mixture with a spoon until it looks like thin milk or has the consistency of soup.
If you have purchased rice cereal that already contains formula, prepare the cereal as directed on the packaging. In some cases, you may only need to add water.

, Although the mixture has the consistency of milk, serve it to your infant with a small spoon.Eating the mixture from a spoon will also keep your baby from overeating and ingesting too many calories.Your baby is used to drinking formula from a bottle and instinctively knows how much to drink based on volume.However, adding cereal and eating from a spoon can make it more difficult for your baby to know when to stop eating.

, The first mixture that your infant eats should be thin. You can thicken the mixture over time. Give your infant one teaspoon (5 ml) of the mixture at the end of breastfeeding or bottle feeding at first. Gradually build up to one to four tablespoons (15 to 60 ml) of the mixture two times a day. This process will give your infant time to develop his or her ability to swallow.Place the spoon near your baby's lips and let your baby smell and taste the cereal on the spoon first. Your baby will probably refuse to eat at first.If your infant is not interested in the mixture or refuses to eat it, try the mixture again the next day. You can also try a thinner mixture.
Your infant may intermittently spit out some cereal with his or her tongue as a natural reflex.
You can also feed your infant formula or breast milk from the bottle, serve the rice mixture from the spoon, and then end the feeding with formula or breast milk from the bottle.
You can begin to thicken the mixture once your baby has tolerated the mixture well for three to five days.Your baby may vomit after trying the rice cereal the first few times. Do not worry about this. Just try the rice cereal again the next day.

, An infant that is allergic to the mixture may experience bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased gas. If your infant experiences any of these symptoms, stop feeding him or her the mixture until you speak with your doctor. If your infant has hives or difficulty breathing after eating the mixture, see a doctor immediately.Your infant is more likely to have an allergic reaction if a close family member has any type of allergies, eczema, or asthma.
Talk to your doctor about your family history of food allergies when you discuss introducing rice cereal and solid foods.

, Most rice cereals are made from processed, white rice. Rice has a higher concentration of arsenic than other grains. Arsenic is a carcinogen (i.e. cancer causing) that can set your child up for health problems later in life.If you are concerned about exposing your baby to arsenic, you can choose a cereal made from other grains (e.g. oats, quinoa, wheat, and barley).Not only does whole grain cereal reduce your baby's exposure to arsenic, it has more fiber and nutrients than white rice cereal.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends cereals made from oats as an alternative to rice cereal., Although rice cereal is the most common first food, other foods are acceptable as well. Finely chopped meat and pureed vegetables can be your baby's first food.Mashed avocado and stewed pears are good options for a first solid food.Introducing rice cereal is a tradition, but it is completely safe to try other solid foods first.No matter what solid food you offer, make sure it contains no sugar or salt.
Wait three to five days between each new food that you introduce."

After your baby has finished feeding and has burped make sure to clean the bottle and nipple in hot soapy water.",How to Bottle Feed Babies," Before you are able to bottle feed you will need to purchase bottles, nipples, a bottle brush, and a sterilizer. A sterilizer is optional if you have a dishwasher that has a steam setting. There are many types of bottles and nipples you can choose from. Some babies take to only one type of nipple and may you go through many nipples trying to figure out which one they like and latch on too. It is very important to watch the flow on the nipples. There are different step nipples that allow either a slow flow or a quick flow. A newborn baby should have the lowest flow. You increase the flow with the baby’s age and how quickly they are drinking their bottle.;
, If you are formula feeding your baby it is important to stick to one type of formula unless it causes complications for your baby. There are many types of formulas on the market. Most hospitals will start your baby off on one kind of formula and if your baby is taking this formula without any gas, constipation, fussiness, or spit up you can continue to use this type of formula. If you are not sure which type of formula to start your baby on talk to your pediatrician and they will help you choose a formula that will work for your baby.

, To prepare formula you need to follow the directions on the side of the can. It is not necessary to heat up formula as long as it is at room temperature. Some babies prefer their formula a little warmer and it is up to you whether or not you want to heat it up for them. If you choose to heat it up you can stick the bottle in boiling water for a short time or use a bottle warmer. Make sure to shake the bottle up after heating it to make sure that there aren't any hot spots. It is not recommended to use a microwave because they can cause serious hot spots in the milk that will burn the baby’s mouth. You can test how warm the formula is by putting some on the inside of your wrist. If it’s too hot cool the bottle off by running it under cold water.

, Cuddling and comforting your baby are one of the many joys of feeding your baby. This is a time when you can bond. Cradling your baby is one of the easiest ways to hold your baby while feeding them. It is not recommended to lay your baby flat down while feeding them because milk can go up the tubes and cause ear infections. Putting a bib on the baby will protect you from getting his/her clothes dirty if he/she spits up. It is very important to burp a young baby 2 to 3 times per feeding to prevent him/her from getting gas. You can do this by patting your baby on the back until he/she burps.

, Use the bottle brush to clean the inside of the bottle. Some bottle brushes have nipple cleaners on the other end. Make sure to clean the nipple out well. After the bottles are clean make sure to sterilize them for future use. New babies are more susceptible to germs and don't have as good immune systems to prevent sickness. Sterilizing the bottles helps kill of germs and keep your baby healthy.

Decide what type of pump is right for you.,
Pick the right time to start pumping.,
Let your baby's feeding schedule be your guide.,
Get relaxed.,
Encourage letdown.,
Make sure your supplies are clean and wash your hands before starting.",How to Pump Breast Milk1," Every type of breast pump comes with pros and cons. Reflect on your lifestyle, your baby's needs and your own preferences and decide which pump works best for you. Pumps can cost as little as $30 or as much as $1,000, and range from simple manual devices to high-tech electric machines. Here's an outline of the options:



Manual pumps. These simple devices are the least expensive option. They come with a shield that is placed over the nipple and a plunging device that sucks the milk into a bottle. Women like manual pumps because they're cheap and nice to have around when you just want to pump a little milk. On the other hand, this option isn't practical for women who plan on bottle-feeding their baby using primarily pumped milk, because each pumping session takes at least 45 minutes and requires the use of both hands.

Electric pumps. These pumps are easy to use and pump more milk much faster than hand pumps. You flip a switch and let the machine go to work, and in the 15 - 20 minutes it takes to pump the milk, you can type, read a book or make a phone call because your hands are free. However, this option is the most expensive; plan to pay several hundred or up to $1,000 dollars, depending on the brand.

Battery-operated pumps. Consider this type of pump the middle ground, both in terms of expense and the amount of effort required. Battery-operated pumps don't pump quite as much milk as electric pumps, but they don't require the use of both hands like manual pumps. One downside is that they frequently run out of batteries during pumping sessions.;
, Every mother has different needs and preferences when it comes to choosing when to start pumping and bottle feeding. Premature babies may need to take the bottle from day one, meaning you'll need to start pumping right away. In most cases, it's advised to wait at least 3 weeks before you introduce the bottle, to avoid ""nipple confusion."" Ultimately, though, the choice is yours as the motherIf you're planning to start pumping when you go back to work, practice for a few weeks beforehand to get used to it first.
If you want to start pumping before you're ready to introduce the bottle to your baby, you can freeze the milk for later.

, On the days when you pump, the easiest way to make sure you get the most milk is to align your pumping with your baby's schedule. That way you can take advantage of your body's natural cycle, rather than trying to force milk to come at random times.


Keep in mind that the more often you pump, the more milk you'll produce.You can pump one breast while your baby is feeding on the other. This is an easy way to get plenty of milk.
You can wait one hour after a feeding and pump both breasts.
If you're at work or away, pump at the time of day when your baby would normally feed.

, The pumping process is easiest and least uncomfortable when you're feeling relaxed and calm. Whether you're pumping with your baby on your other breast or you're in the middle of the workday, it's important to find a space that feels peaceful and give yourself plenty of time. Rushing the process is only going to make it more difficult.

, That means helping the milk move down into your breasts so that it'll flow freely into the pump. Massaging your breasts, draping a warm cloth over them, and allowing them to swing downward can all help to encourage letdown., This will ensure that the milk doesn't get contaminated during the pumping process. Be sure to wash the pump, bottle and other supplies after each pumping session, too.

Place the breast shield over your nipple.,
Use the squeeze or plunging mechanism to begin pumping.,
Reposition the pump's handle if necessary.,
Try leaning forward to make milk express more easily.,
Continue until the milk flow slows.",How to Pump Breast Milk2," Make sure that you have the appropriate-sized shield for your breast. Selecting an inappropriately sized shield can result in failed suction efforts, pain, and irritation.

, Hold the shield in place with one hand and squeeze the mechanism with the other. The milk will begin pumping into the bottle.

, Changing the position of the pump's handle can affect its suction ability, so move it around until you find an appropriate suction level that makes your breast pumping efforts easier.

, Using gravity can help encourage the flow of milk into the container.

, When pumping with a manual pump, it usually takes about 45 minutes.

"
"
Position the breast shield over your nipple correctly.,
Turn the machine on and let it work.,
Adjust the automatic suction as necessary.,
Remain calm while the suction occurs.,
Continue until the milk flow slows.",How to Pump Breast Milk3," If you have a double breast pump, you'll want to position 2 shields over your nipples simultaneously. Double breast pumps can save enormous amounts of time for mothers who need to produce milk quickly or who have a baby who requires a lot of milk.

, The milk will automatically begin pumping from your breast into the container.

, If the milk seems to be pumping slowly or the suction feels painful, adjust it. Try repositioning your breasts and the rest of your body. The process should not be painful, although it may feel strange at first.

, This will make the pumping process go much more smoothly. Some mothers can be made uneasy by a loud breast pumping machine. However, if you're relaxed, you will often produce more milk in less time than you would while anxious.

, When using an electric or battery-operated pump, you should be finished within 15 to 20 minutes.

Store milk in the refrigerator for up to three days.,
Freeze milk for a few months.,
Store milk in convenient serving sizes.",How to Pump Breast Milk4," You can store it in either the bottle that it's pumped into or in another container designed for breast milk storage. Make sure to label the containers and use the oldest milk first., If you have extra breast milk, you can freeze it in plastic containers designed for breast milk storage. Fill the containers 3/4 full to allow room for the milk to expand. Label the containers and be sure to use the milk within three or four months.


Don't freeze milk in bags that are not designed for this specific purpose. Certain plastics can leach chemicals into the milk. Disposable bottle bags are too flimsy.
When you're ready to use the milk, thaw it in the refrigerator first. Don't thaw it at room temperature.
Don't add fresh milk to a container of frozen milk.

, Rather than storing a big jar of milk, store it in small serving-sized containers in portions of 2 - 4 ounces, depending on how much your baby usually takes."

Start above the breast and stroke with a circular motion while moving towards the nipple.Then move again to the outside of the breast in a different area and repeat, moving towards the nipple. Do this until you have moved around the entire breast.
Do not “rough up” your nipples by scrubbing them roughly with a towel. This will remove the natural oils that your breast produces and may make them sore.;
, Some women have inverted, or flat, nipples which appear to have an indentation in the middle. You can determine whether your nipples are inverted using the pinch test:Pinch your breast between your thumb and forefinger on the areola, the dark area about an inch above and below the nipple.
If your nipple becomes erect, it is not inverted. If it retracts into the breast, it is inverted. Women may have one inverted and one protruding nipple.
The degree of inversion can vary from slight to severe.
Your doctor will also be able to tell you whether your nipples are inverted or flat.

, Many women with inverted nipples are able to successfully breastfeed without a problem. However, there are devices you can buy and techniques you can learn about to prepare in case your baby has trouble:Push your nipples out with breast shells. Breast shells are plastic devices which press on your breast making the nipple pop out. You can prepare your breasts by wearing them before the birth and then after the birth for about 30 minutes before feeding time.
Use the Hoffman Technique to stretch your nipple and make it easier to pop out. Put both thumbs on either side of your nipple and press into your breast while also spreading your thumbs apart. Work your way around the nipple. Start doing it twice a day and work up to five times per day. Continue doing it after birth.
Use a breast pump to pull out your nipple right before feeding.
Try an Evert-It Nipple Enhancer. This device uses suction to pull your nipple out.
Stimulate your nipples to make them erect before feeding. Massage them between your thumb and forefinger until they protrude. You can also, very briefly, apply a cold compress, but do not numb it. This will make milk less likely to flow.
As your baby latches on to drink, squeeze your breast or pull the skin back towards your chest. This will help the nipple protrude.
Try a nipple shield in consultation with a lactation specialist. This is worn over the breast and allows milk to flow through a hole to the baby. If the baby has difficulty gripping the breast in its mouth, the shield may help. But do not use it without professional help to make sure it is done properly.

, Washing your breasts in clear water will be sufficient to keep them clean.Lotions and lubricants are not needed unless your nipples are very dry.
If you have psoriasis or eczema, talk to your doctor about what medications you can use while breastfeeding.
Wash your hands before breastfeeding or expressing milk., Adoptive mothers can often breastfeed by stimulating their breasts to produce milk.Stimulate your breasts through pumping every 2-3 hours around the clock before the baby comes.
Use a Medela Supplemental Nursing System or a Lact-Aid Nurser Training System to feed your baby additional milk while he or she stimulates your body to increase its milk supply.
The quantity of milk adoptive mothers can produce varies greatly. It may still be necessary to provide some formula.

, They can provide you with advice and support.


Breastfeeding difficulties are very common, so chances are you will know people who have had similar problems.

, Many maternity wards in hospitals and birthing clinics have staff available to assist new mothers.Consult your doctor about any medications, herbal remedies, or supplements you may plan on taking while breastfeeding. Ask your doctor whether they are safe for your baby during breastfeeding.
If you have had breast surgery or implants, ask your doctor whether it will likely impact your ability to breastfeed.

, You will be able to learn techniques for breastfeeding, including how to hold the baby to encourage it to latch on properly.Most courses encourage partners to attend as well so they can learn what to do to be supportive.
Ask the experts any questions you might have.

, Even if your baby has not yet arrived, you can meet the consultant, discuss your concerns, and develop a trusting relationship.If you need help learning to breastfeed, the expert may be able to come to your home and assist you.

, Your doctor may be able to suggest a support group in your area. If there isn’t one, you may be able to find one online.La Leche League International has in-person and online support groups and information sessions in many languages."

Consider continuing prenatal vitamins.",How to Prevent Hair Loss While Breast Feeding1," Although you cannot prevent hair loss when you are breastfeeding because of hormonal changes, poor hair care may make your hair loss worse.Using good and healthy hair care habits may help minimize how much hair you lose.

, Clean your hair and scalp regularly and in a gentle manner with shampoo and conditioner. This can help prevent damage that may cause further hair loss.Wash your hair every other day or as little as necessary. Frequent washing can damage your strands.Massage shampoo into your scalp and into the length of your hair.Rinse by allowing water to flow from your scalp down the ends of your hair. Don’t rub your hair as it rinses, which may cause further hair loss., After you finish washing and rinsing your hair, apply a conditioner along the length of your hair from ends to scalp. This can help prevent further hair loss through damage, including breaking. It can also make your hair appear fuller.Make sure to use conditioner every time you wash your hair.You can use a rinse-out or leave in conditioner., Drying your hair with towels and hair dryers can cause damage and break off strands of hair. Dry your hair with caution to help prevent breakage and further hair loss.Use a soft towel to rub or pat your strands dry.Avoid the temptation to wrap your hair in a towel, which can damage your hair and cause breakage.Let your hair air dry if possible.If you use a hair dryer, use the lowest heat setting.Reducing the number of times per week that you use a hair dryer can also promote hair growth., If you brush or comb your hair, try and do this as infrequently and gently as possible. Reducing how often you brush or comb and changing the way in which you do it can help you from losing strands and prevent breakage.Only brush your hair to style it. It’s a myth that you should brush your hair 100 strokes a day.Allow your hair to air dry a bit before brushing or combing after washing.Use a wide toothed comb to untangle wet hair. This will may minimize how much hair you lose through brushing.If your hair is tangled, remove tangles gently and use a conditioner to help you if necessary.

, Many women want to style their hair or use styling products such as curling irons, which are often hotter than a dryer. If you style your hair, choose loose styles, avoid heavy products, and use lower heat tools.Pulling hair back tightly in ponytails or styles such as cornrows not only can break or damage hair, but also may cause hair loss. Wear your hair pulled back loosely and try different hairstyles every day to allow your hair and scalp to relax.A loose ponytail or braid can keep strands from falling on to your baby but also may prevent your baby from pulling out your hair when you breastfeed her.
Use covered elastic bands to pull back your hair. Rubber can pull and break hair.If you use styling tools such as curling irons or hot combs, keep them at the lowest setting.If you wear a weave or hair extensions, make sure they are light so that they don’t pull at your hair and scalp and cause further hair loss., This is some mixed evidence that massaging your scalp may stimulate and increase blood flow.

Try massaging your own scalp to help prevent further hair loss and promote hair growth.Increased blood flow results in increased nutrient absorption, which may help prevent hair loss and breakage, and could stimulate your hair to grow more quickly.Massage can help condition the scalp and strengthen the roots of your hair, which in turn may minimize how much hair you lose while breastfeeding., There is some evidence that lavender oil may help hair loss. Massage a small amount into your hair and scalp to minimize hair loss and promote growth.You can get lavender oil at health food stores and some grocery stores.
Rub a small amount into your scalp once a day., If you are breastfeeding, you need to get enough nutrients to produce milk and maintain your health. Increase your intake of nutrients can keep you healthy, help you produce enough milk, and may also help your hair stay strong, which may prevent further hair loss.Not getting sufficient vitamins and nutrients can exacerbate hair loss. Be sure you’re eating properly and staying hydrated.
In addition to your regular calorie intake, you will need to factor in extra calories for nursing. You will need up to 650 extra calories per day to produce sufficient milk.Protein is one of the building blocks of hair. Getting enough lean protein from meat, dairy products, fish, eggs, and nuts can help your hair get strong and grow.
Iron helps prevent hair loss. You can get extra iron from red meat, fish, and chicken, as well as options such as lentils, kale, and broccoli.Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron as well as produce collagen that can strengthen your hair shafts. Try eating blueberries, broccoli, oranges, and strawberries to get sufficient vitamin C.Omega-3 fatty acids help keep the oils on your scalp, which in turn keep your hair hydrated. Get Omega-3s in fish such as salmon and trout, and other sources including avocado and pumpkin seeds.A lack of zinc and/ or selenium can lead to hair loss. Eat fortified whole grains, oysters, beef, and eggs to get enough zinc to prevent hair loss.Biotin helps keep hair strong and flexible. Too little may cause brittle hair or hair loss. You can get biotin from whole grains, liver, eggs, and yeast., Your body will need sufficient additional nutrients to support milk production, but also to keep you and your hair healthy. You may want to consider continuing to take pre-natal vitamins to help you get additional nutrients to help ensure that your hair stays as strong as possible.


During breastfeeding, the body is designed to put your child’s nutritional needs before yours. If you’re not getting enough nutrients to support your health, you may experience exacerbated hair loss.
It’s safe to continue taking pre-natal vitamins if you’re breastfeeding and your doctor may recommend them to you to ensure you’re getting the nutrition you need.Try and get as many nutrients as possible from healthy and whole foods.

Wash your hands before you handle or express breast milk.,
Start the milk flow.,
Express milk by hand.,
Pump following the manufacturer's instructions.,
Do not use a secondhand pump.,
Prepare a clean container to store expressed milk.,
Do not add fresh milk to frozen milk.,
Follow the recommended guidelines for storing milk.,
Observe the recommended time limits when freezing milk.,
Use the oldest milk first.,
Thaw frozen milk carefully.,
Do not thaw milk in the microwave.,
Check the temperature of the milk.",How to Prepare Breast Milk," This is very important to prevent bacteria on your hands from contaminating the milk. Babies’ immune systems are not as well-developed as those of adults, so bacteria that wouldn’t make older people sick can be harmful to an infant.

Scrub your hands thoroughly with soap. Don’t forget to include under your nails and between your fingers.
Rinse your hands in warm running water. Let the water run over your hands and wash away any dirt or bacteria that may be there.
Dry your hands with a clean towel.;
, If you express or pump at the times when your baby would normally feed, this will help you to continue making milk on schedule for your baby. You do not need to wash your breast or nipple before expressing milk. You can start the milk flow by sitting in a quiet place and thinking about your baby. If you have trouble, you may want to try:Looking at a photo of your baby
Holding a blanket or item of clothing that smells like your baby
Gently massaging your breasts or nipples
Putting warm, wet compresses on your breasts

, This technique has the benefit that it is convenient and free. You don't need to bring any specialized equipment with you. It may require some practice. Once you are good at it, it can be as fast as pumping.Put your thumb and forefinger on opposite sides of your areola.
Move them backwards against your chest.
Gently squeeze your fingers together while moving them slightly towards your nipple. Your fingers should not slide along your skin.
Release the pressure. Continue this process while moving your fingers to different positions around your areola.
Collecting the milk can be difficult when expressing milk by hand. Try expressing into a large, clean bowl or a sterilized container with a large mouth — you may want to place these containers on a table that is about hip-height or hold them with one hand. You can also express into a milk storage bag, holding the bag with one hand and using the other hand to express the milk., There are two main types of pumps: manual and electric.Manual pumps require that you work it with your hand. It requires some skill and practice. This option is generally best if you only need to pump occasionally. It may also increase your risk of a breast infection. Manual pumps generally cost $50 or less.
Electric pumps run on batteries or electricity. They can also pump both breasts simultaneously. They usually cost between $150 to more than $250.
Pumps must be washed with soap and water between uses.

, There is a difference between pumps that are available for purchase and pumps that are available to rent. Rental pumps are closed system pumps, which means that there are certain parts of the pump that never come into contact with the milk. A purchase pump is an open system, which means that the pump motor comes into contact with the milk. Unfortunately, the way the open system pumps are built means they cannot be completely sterilized, like a rental pump. So, if you use a secondhand pump, your baby may receive particles of another mother's milk.Viruses such as HIV (AIDS) can be spread through breast milk.
Rental pumps can be obtained from hospitals or breastfeeding organizations.
Breast pumps must be covered by health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

, It is important that the container be sterile and strong enough that it won’t break. It should also be BPA-free.You can store the milk in a sterile bottle. The cap must be water- and airtight so that it cannot spill or get contaminated. Bottles with screw tops work well. Bottles have the advantage that they are stronger and less prone to tearing and leaking than bags. Because milk expands as it freezes, do not fill the container to the brim.
Bottles can be sterilized by using a commercial cold water sterilizing solution, steam sterilizing, or boiling. Follow the bottle manufacturer’s directions for how to sterilize your bottles. The directions may instruct you to boil the bottle for several minutes. Steam sterilizers can be purchased at your local pharmacy.
You can purchase bags designed for storing breast milk at your local pharmacy or any store that carries baby items. Bags can be put into a plastic container to protect them while they are stored.
Do not use ordinary thin plastic bags or formula bottle bags because these are not as strong. They are more prone to tearing.
Write the date on the container so that you will know how long it has been stored. If you are providing the milk to someone else, like a day care agency, label it with the child’s name.
You may also want to write how many ounces you pumped so that you will know how many bags you need to thaw at a time.

, The fresh milk is warmer and it will cause the frozen milk to partially thaw, providing the opportunity for bacteria to grow.If your baby does not drink all of the milk from one feeding, do not save the milk to be used again. Some people find it useful to store each 2 to 4 ounces separately. This means that you only need to thaw the amount for one feeding.

, The amount of time that you store milk depends upon the temperature at which it is stored. The following guidelines are for healthy infants that were carried the full term. For premature or sick infants, follow the guidelines provided by your hospital or doctor.Milk can be kept at room temperature (77°F or 25°C) for no longer than six hours. It should be kept cool and covered. If the room is warmer, you should not keep it for longer than four hours.
Milk can be kept in an insulated cooler bag (5 to 39°F or -15 to 4°C) for 24 hours. Ice packs should be in the insulated bag with the milk.
Milk can be stored in a refrigerator (39°F or 4°C) for five days. The temperature will be the most constant at the back of the refrigerator.

, If you store the milk at the back of the freezer, the temperature will be the most constant. This will minimize temperature fluctuations that occur when you open and close the freezer. If milk is stored for longer than the amount of time listed, it starts to degrade and is less nutritious.Milk stored in the freezer section of a refrigerator (5°F or -15°C) can be stored for two weeks.
Milk stored in a separate freezer section of a refrigerator (0°F or -18°C) can be kept for three to six months. The freezer compartment should have a separate section so that the temperature doesn’t rise every time someone opens the refrigerator.
Milk stored in a deep freezer (-4°F or -20°C) can be kept for six to twelve months.

, This will help you to avoid storing milk too long or wasting it. In addition, the nutrients in human milk change over time so that the milk provides your baby with what it needs at the current time. This means that by preventing some milk from getting too old, you make sure that your baby gets what they need at each feeding.After three months, the fats in frozen milk begin to degrade, reducing the nutritional quality of the milk.The milk loses vitamin C over time, so the sooner you use it the better.

, The milk should be fed at body temperature. If your baby will drink cold milk, you can also feed them directly after taking it out of the refrigerator. Thawed breast milk may look a little different or have a consistency that is a little different from fresh milk. This is okay and it is still safe to feed to your infant. Thawing can be done either in the refrigerator or using warm water.If you plan to use the milk the next day, you can put it in the refrigerator to thaw overnight.
Milk can also be thawed by running the closed, watertight container under warm water or putting it in a bowl of warm water.
Milk that is thawed should be used within 24 hours or thrown out.

, A microwave will heat the milk unevenly. This means that some of the milk might be too cold and some might be so hot that it might burn the baby.Bottles that are heated too quickly may explode in a microwave.
If the milk is heated too much the nutrients may start to degrade, making it less nutritious for the baby.
Heating the milk too fast may damage the antibodies in the milk that help build up the baby’s immune system.

, Breast milk can be given warm or cold; however, if it is too hot it may burn the baby.Swirl the milk gently to mix it. This will mix and distribute the cream part, which rises to the top, throughout the milk. Do not shake the milk because that can cause some of the nutrients to break down.
After swirling, apply a few drops to the inside of your wrist. It should be warm but not hot. It should not feel uncomfortable.

See your doctor.,
Understand that postpartum hair loss is normal.,
Accept that your hormones—and hair-- will return to normal.,
Use volumizing hair products.,
Consider a new hairstyle.",How to Prevent Hair Loss While Breast Feeding2," If you feel your hair loss is excessive or you are depressed or anxious about it, make an appointment with your doctor. She may be able to reassure you, prescribe medications to help you cope with your hair loss, or may even suggest medical treatments to help you stimulate hair regrowth that will not harm your baby when you breastfeed.Your doctor may order blood tests to assess your postpartum hormone levels, which can cause hair loss., When you are pregnant, the increased levels of estrogen stop your hair growth and hair that would have normally fallen out stays attached to your scalp. This results in the thicker hair most women experience during pregnancy. Once you’ve given birth, your estrogen levels will drop, and the hair that didn’t fall out during your pregnancy, will.You don’t need to worry about going bald. Remember that you had increased amounts of hair during your pregnancy and your body is just getting itself back to normal after you give birth and breast feed., You cannot completely prevent or stop hair loss after birth or when you are breastfeeding. It may take anywhere from 6 to 12 months for your hormones and hair to return to their pre-pregnancy stage, at which point the loss may slow down and return to normal.While you are waiting for your hair loss to cease, you can cope with your new hair by being adventurous in other ways with the hair you have. You can try a new cut or color or even new styling methods.
It can help to speak to other mothers who have experienced hair loss while they were breastfeeding. This may help you to manage your anxiety about your hair loss and more readily accept that you will likely return to normal within the first year of your child’s birth., If the hair loss is bothersome or heavy, try new hair-care products designed to help thicken your hair. These products can make your hair appear fuller and give you confidence until your hair returns to normal.Products such as mousse and hair texturizers are formulated to give you more volume as well as “bulk up” the appearance of your hair., Hair loss can be less obvious in shorter or layered hair. With a new baby at home and trying to keep to a breastfeeding schedule, you may want to consider a new hairstyle that is simpler.You may also want to consider a new style to pep yourself up if you are feeling sad or depressed about your hair loss.You don’t automatically have to consider cutting off all of your hair. If you’re loathe to lose length while you’re breastfeeding and losing hair, consider a layered style, which will increase the appearance of your hair’s volume."

Consume enough calories.,
Get the right nutrients.,
Stay hydrated.,
Continue with your supplements.",How to Plan a Vegetarian Diet for a Breast Feeding Mom1," Just like when you are pregnant, you are eating for two when you are breastfeeding. It's very important that breastfeeding moms make sure to consume enough calories — in fact, you will need to consume more calories than you did when you were pregnant. Your body will be burning extra calories when you breastfeed, so take that into account when planning your meals. Typically, women will need an additional 400 – 500 calories per day during the first six months of breastfeeding.This is useful for losing pregnancy weight, but it means you need to account for the loss of calories when planning your diet.
During the second six months of breastfeeding, you will likely burn about 400 additional calories per day.;
, When you are breastfeeding, it's not enough to just eat more calories — ""empty"" calories, or those that provide no nutritional value, should be avoided. You need to make sure that you are choosing nutrient-rich foods. You and your baby need specific nutrients in your diet to keep you both healthy.It is important to get enough protein. Sometimes, this can pose the greatest challenge for vegetarians. Aim to get about 89 grams per day. High protein foods include beans, nuts, and eggs (which many vegetarians don't eat).
You also need to make sure to eat plenty of Vitamin B12. You can get your daily 26 mcgs by drinking milk or fortified soy milk. You can also find it in fortified cereals and yogurt.
Breastfeeding moms need about 1,000 mgs per day of calcium.Eat vegetarian dairy products, fortified orange juice, dark leafy greens, and almonds. You can get Vitamin D from these sources, too.
Empty calories include things like cakes, cookies, pastries, soda, ice cream, bacon, hot dogs, and pizza.

, It's important to drink plenty of fluids while you are breastfeeding. Make it a habit to drink whenever you are thirsty. Water is the best choice, but you can supplement that with low-sugar juices and soups. Make sure to limit your caffeine intake while breastfeeding. Opt for caffeine free green tea instead.
Low fat milk is also a great choice to help you stay hydrated.

, It can be difficult to get the required nutrients when you are following a vegetarian diet. Continue taking your daily prenatal vitamins until you stop breastfeeding. In fact, the Mayo Clinic recommends that all women of child bearing-age take a prenatal vitamin, even if they are not planning to become pregnant.Your doctor may also suggest additional supplements.


One of the most common supplements for breastfeeding mom is Vitamin B-12. This nutrient is key to your baby's development, and is found almost exclusively in animal products.Your doctor might also recommend a Vitamin D supplement. This is especially common if you are not able to get enough natural sunlight.
Your baby needs Vitamin D to help him absorb calcium. A Vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets, which is a weakening of the bones.

Make rest and sleep a priority.",How to Lose Weight While Breastfeeding," It may seem counterintuitive, but it is important to eat regularly to lose weight. While nursing, you should never eat fewer than 1,500-1,800 calories daily, and most women require much more than this. Starving yourself is never a good idea, and is particularly dangerous when recovering from childbirth and nursing your baby. Too few calories can also be counterproductive to your weight loss goals.


Breastfeeding burns an additional 300-500 calories per day, and has been shown to reduce postpartum weight retention overall for most women even without caloric restriction.You should eat enough to satisfy that calorie requirement in addition to that of a healthy diet.
While studies have not shown that there is a significant relationship between reduced maternal intake of calories and milk production, eating too few calories can put your health at risk and increase fatigue.Eating regular meals and snacks will take the edge off of your hunger and allow you to more easily manage what you eat. If you allow yourself to get too hungry, you will end up reaching for the most convenient food available, rather than the healthiest option.
When you don’t take in enough calories, your body enters a “starvation mode” known as adaptive thermogenesis in order to reduce the amount of energy you are expending, including burning calories. This can function as a type of weight loss sabotage.;
, Eating a treat such as nuts, apple slices, or carrot sticks between meals is an excellent way to keep hunger at bay. Whether working at home or outside of it, nursing moms don’t have a lot of free time. Prepare healthy snacks in advance when you have a spare moment.


Keep healthy snacks within reach while you are nursing your baby. Nursing forces you to sit still for a moment and rest, the perfect time to grab a bite.
Try keeping nonperishable snacks, like nuts or dried fruit, in your purse or diaper bag, or in your car for easy access on the go.
Make sure to wash all fruits and vegetables. The FDA recommends washing fresh produce under running water just before eating, cutting or cooking. Using soap or commercial produce washes is unnecessary., It's advisable to wait a minimum of a full 2 months after childbearing prior to actively attempting to slim down. But during this time, you can be eating healthy and avoid junk food as much as possible. After that period has passed, try to lose weight at a slow, but steady, pace, rather than all at once. A pound and a half a week is a reasonable goal.Avoid trend diet plans, cleanses, promises of rapid weight loss, fat burning medicines, diet plan tablets and natural supplements. These things might possibly be risky for anybody, and are especially high-risk while nursing.
Studies show that losing weight too quickly puts additional stress on your cardiovascular system. Childbirth and nursing put enough stress on your body, you don’t need to add more.When you go on a crash diet, your body tends to burn muscle and lose water weight, instead of burning fat. This makes keeping the weight off a lot more difficult than if you had lost weight over a more extended period of time., Not all women experience postpartum weight loss during breastfeeding the same way. You should think about your weight loss plan as a long term, healthy lifestyle, rather than an immediate goal. Don't get discouraged if your weight loss doesn't go exactly as you hoped.


You may drop some weight quickly in the first few weeks after you deliver, but keep in mind that it will not all come off that quickly.
Don't expect results overnight. It might take a year or more to lose the additional weight you have acquired while pregnant. Unless you're a celebrity with a personal trainer, nutritionist, and live-in nanny, losing your baby weight takes time.
Some women find it very difficult to lose weight while breastfeeding and experience a greater loss in weight after they wean their baby. This may be due to lack of routine and sleep, which can contribute to overeating.
Your body also releases the hormone prolactin during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which triggers milk production. Some research suggests that if you have a higher level of prolactin, it can suppress your metabolism.When taking stock of your weight loss goals, remember that you will usually keep about three pounds of extra tissue in your breasts as long as you are nursing. , Choose foods rich in iron, protein, and calcium, as opposed to foods with empty calories or those high in fats or sugars. High protein foods are especially important because they will keep you feeling full for longer. Try to avoid foods that are highly processed or that are simple carbs, like white bread, white rice, cookies, and candy. This will help you lose weight without sacrificing your nutritional health.


Good sources of iron include whole-grain products, dark leafy vegetables, and citrus fruits.
Eggs and dairy products, as well as leans meats, soy products and meat substitutes, legumes, lentils, nuts, seeds and whole grains contain protein.
For calcium, consider dairy products or dark green vegetables. You can also find calcium-enriched products like juices, cereals, soy milk, yogurt and tofu., Not only will it help you lose weight, but a healthier diet enhances the nutritional value of your breast milk. Junk foods and fast foods offer empty calories that do not offer sustained sources of energy you need to take care of yourself and your baby.


Avoiding the extra salt, sugar and preservatives in processed foods is better for you overall.
Decrease your fat intake to 20-25% or less of total calories. Replace those fat calories with foods that are lower in fat, but higher in protein.Watch out for hidden sugars in juices and sodas that add on additional calories without nutritional benefit. Many sodas also contain caffeine, which should be limited to less than 2 to 3 cups per day. More than that can disrupt your baby's sleeping habits (and yours)., There are creative ways to chart the progress you have made in your efforts to lose weight. A weight loss chart can help you see on a daily, weekly, monthly and even yearly basis how much you have lost.


Make you own chart using an excel spreadsheet. This option allows you to include information that is most relevant to you.
Download a weight loss chart. There are many different types of weight loss charts available with just a brief online search. Many are free to download and print out.
There are examples of other types of body measurement charts available online as well. Get inspiration from what other people have done to create your own.
If you chose to chart every day, pick the same time of day in which to weigh yourself and record it. Remember that you tend to weigh the least first thing in the morning.It is easy to begin obsessing about your weight once you start to keep close track of it. Try to keep your charting within reason. Avoid weighing yourself more than once a day, and don’t get frustrated if your weight fluctuates both up and down.

, The stress that comes with a new baby is difficult to handle, but try to keep stress at bay as much as you can. Stress can get in the way of your weight loss plans. When you feel stressed, your body releases cortisol, which can increase appetite and drive you to eat more. Stress can also cause you to store extra “visceral fat” in your midsection, exactly where you probably wish to slim down the most.To reduce stress, write down your feelings and frustrations during the day, so they don’t keep you up at night. Keep a journal of your experiences with motherhood, breastfeeding, and your efforts to lose weight.
Talk about how you’re feeling. Share your thoughts with your partner or a trusted friend or relative. Commiserate about the challenges that come with a new baby with other moms online or in person.
Try to focus on good moments with your baby, rather than the struggles that come with motherhood. Keep in mind that the time your baby is of breastfeeding age is very short.
Ask for help. If you’re feeling overwhelmed with the responsibilities of breastfeeding and motherhood, reach out to those around you for help. Make sure your partner is shouldering his or her share of the burden. Ask grandparents to help take care of older children or help prepare meals.

, An exercise as easy as power walking can result in fast and efficient weight management all over, including your belly. There are several fun ways to stay active, even while taking care of a nursing baby. Power walk or run while pushing your child in a stroller around your neighborhood. This is a pleasant way to get some exercise for yourself and some fresh air for your baby.
There are many exercise strollers available on market. Some are designed for serious running, while others are more tailored to a brisk walk. Find one that suits your exercise needs.
If you dislike the bulk of pushing around a stroller, consider buying a baby carrier or sling to use on walks and outings with your baby.
Make your cardio workouts a social event. If you know other moms with young children in your area, invite them to go for a walk. This is a great way to get out and socialize, which can be difficult if you are staying home to care for your baby.
Everything in moderation. Do not exercise to the point of exhaustion, but even vigorous exercise is fine while breastfeeding (after getting the green light from your doctor post-partum of course)., There are a few extra steps you as a nursing mother should take before engaging in exercise for your own comfort and the comfort of your baby. It is important to keep your body and your breasts in good shape for nursing and milk production.


Wear a supportive sports bra when doing vigorous activity. Supporting your breasts with a well-fitting bra reduces nipple friction and discomfort. Nursing sports bras are now available for active moms.
Drink some extra water before and during your workout. An extra two of three glasses of water will help ensure that you do not get dehydrated, which can affect your milk supply.
Try to nurse before your workout. This will settle your baby, if you are bringing him or her along, and working out without engorged breasts is much more comfortable.If you sweat extensively when working out, rinse your breasts before nursing. Some babies don’t like the taste of salt., You don’t need to “bulk up” to get the benefits of weight training. Building any amount of muscle mass burns more calories, even while at rest. Building strength overall is also beneficial for carrying your baby.


Use elastic bands or weights for resistance training, and exercise at intervals that are high in intensity.
More repetitions with lower weight is just as effective at building muscle as working out with heavier weights, and less likely to cause injury.If you regularly lift weights or do exercises with repetitive arm movement, it is important to start slowly. If you find that your breasts become irritated or develop plugged ducts, cut back on these type of exercises for a while., You do not need to do 1000 sit ups to get the benefits of abdominal toning. Just tightening your stomach muscles routinely will aid in toning the muscles there.


Pilates or yoga offer many effective workouts that firm up your core. Yoga has other benefits as well, such as helping your posture after a day of pushing a stroller and lifting your baby.Try planks, or exercises in which you assume a position and hold it for a short period of time. Planks have the benefit of working several muscle groups at once, including muscles on your front, sides, abdomen, back, and even your arms., Most people need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. This is especially difficult for breastfeeding moms who are frequently required to nurse throughout the night. Getting enough rest, however, is important when trying to lose weight.


If you are tired, you will be more likely to reach for a quick shot of energy in the form of carbohydrates or sugar. Your brain’s reward centers become more active when you are tired and you might start looking for an easy fix.
A study has shown that sleeping too little leads some people to eat bigger portions of food, and thus additional calories. This can quickly derail your weight loss plans. You are also less likely to be physically active if you are not getting enough rest. Exercising or going to the gym seem impossible when you are sleep-deprived.Consider pumping your milk and allowing your partner to take over one or two feedings during the night so you can sleep.

, This is particularly true for mothers of infants. The old adage of “nap while the baby naps” is good advice. Take advantage of family members and friends who offer to watch your baby for a few hours so you can rest.


Don't spend all of your baby's nap time doing chores around the house. Take some time to rest while your baby sleeps. Let other people take over some household responsibilities. If you have older children, make a chore chart and get them to do simple and age-appropriate chores like dishes, vacuuming, or taking out the trash.
Just getting off of your feet and resting is beneficial for your body. Remember your body is working extra hard to make food for your baby, be kind to it.
Napping has additional benefits aside from helping you lose weight. A recent study has shown that mothers who nap are less fatigued overall and able to foster more positive interactions with their infants., It is very easy as a new mother to put other people first. While taking care of your baby is very important, taking care of yourself is also a necessity. There are a few strategies you can use to optimize your resting and sleeping while breastfeeding.


Say no to added responsibilities at school and work. Fight your inclination to volunteer for every activity at your older child's school or to work overtime. Set aside time to rest, as well as time to be physically active. Make yourself and your rest a priority.
Avoid caffeine, especially later in the day. Caffeine can keep you awake and destroy your chances of grabbing a few precious hours of sleep.
Make your evenings as peaceful as possible. Try to avoid watching TV, or using the computer or phone before bed.
Make your bedroom a haven for sleep by keeping it quiet, dark, and cool. If you need to, use a sleep mask for maximum darkness."

Use a checklist.,
Plan for multiple meals per day.,
Try a variety of foods.,
Try foods that may increase lactation.,
Make meals in advance.,
Plan some menus.,
Organize your shopping list.",How to Plan a Vegetarian Diet for a Breast Feeding Mom2," When you are pregnant or a new mom, you are bound to be tired and overwhelmed. That means it's even more important to have at least some of your meals planned in advance. When you have a new baby, you'll want to focus your energy on the baby, and not spend the day thinking about getting enough nutrients.Set aside some time at the beginning of each week to plan your meals. The government offers a very useful checklist that you can rely on. You can find checklists here: https://www.choosemyplate.gov/MyPlate-Daily-Checklist

Choosemyplate.gov will allow you to view food choices that will supply you with the needed nutrients. You can pick some foods from each group, and the site will help you figure out which nutrients you're getting and which you still need.

, It is important that you eat frequently while you are breastfeeding. As a new mom, you may find that you don't have time to sit down for a large meal. This means that you need to make sure to eat several smaller meals to ensure that you are getting enough calories for you and your baby each day.Try to eat three regularly sized meals and three between meal snacks per day.
Even if you are at home with your baby, try packing a lunch as if you were going to work. Then you will have a meal you can just grab and eat as needed.
Have plenty of snacks prepared. The ones you can eat with one hand are best, so that you can still care for your baby as needed.
Keep a supply of nuts, fruits, yogurt, and cheese handy.

, You may be planning to breastfeed for several months, so you will be carefully monitoring your food intake for a while. To keep yourself from growing bored with traditional vegetarian fare, try out some new foods. Once you have spent some time learning about the best foods to eat, you'll feel more comfortable experimenting.Make use of lentils. Lentils are an excellent source of protein, but often overlooked. You can make a wide variety of lentil soups, casseroles, and veggie burgers. Bonus: lentils are very inexpensive and will keep in your pantry for a long time.
Try dried fruits. Although fresh fruits are delicious, even our favorite things can grow tiresome. Try switching up your routine by adding some dried fruits, such as mangoes, to your meals. You can even add them to salads.
Experiment with meat substitutes. Most vegetarians are probably familiar with tofu and tempeh. In addition to these great products, grocery stores are adding more meat substitutes each day. Try some vegan gyro ""meat"" to add some variety.
Eat nutrient-dense foods, such as avocado, beans, and full-fat soy milk.

, Talk to your doctor or search online for recipes for meals or snacks containing foods that are thought to boost milk production. While there is no scientific proof that these foods can increase lactation, but there are some foods that have some anecdotal evidence that they can help. Foods to try include oats, fenugreek, fennel, brewer's yeast, spinach.Try searching ""vegetarian lactation bars"" or ""vegetarian lactation cookies"" into a search engine. You will likely find many different recipes.

, If you can prepare some meals in advance of your baby's arrival, you'll find it can make all of the difference in your life as a new mom. In the weeks before your due date spend some time in the kitchen. There are several meals you can make that are nutritious and freeze beautifully.Even without a baby, mornings can be hectic. Don't forget to make some breakfasts to freeze ahead of time. Single-servings of oatmeal or muffins are great options.
Make large batches and freeze into single servings. This will make them easier to reheat and eat. Try a pot of vegetarian chili, a vegetarian lasagna, or a lentil casserole.
Don't forget about snacks. You could make a big batch of granola or homemade peanut butter energy balls to freeze and have on hand.

, Try writing out some daily menus when you are doing your planning. Being able to refer back to your ideas will help you to make sure you have the time and ingredients that you need. You'll also probably gain some peace of mind by planning out your menus in advance.For example, try muffins for breakfast. You can make a whole batch of these single serve meals and freeze them. In a muffin tin, combine eggs (if your vegetarian diet permits you to eat them) and any vegetables you like (think spinach, onions, tomatoes). Add some shredded cheese for extra protein and bake until no longer runny. Wrap in foil and place in a freezer bag. In the morning, just pop one in the microwave for 1 minute and enjoy with one hand.
Lunch can be a challenge. Make burritos or wraps your friend. For example, wrap a whole-wheat tortilla around black beans, cheese, spinach, and salsa. You can make this any time throughout the day (or a day or two ahead) and keep in the fridge. Then, just heat and eat whenever you're ready.
For dinner, eat vegetarian lasagna. You can pack this with veggies, and low-fat cheese is a great source of protein. Make ahead of time, freeze, and heat single-servings as necessary.
Snacks are a necessity. Try making (or having a friend make them) homemade fruit and nut bars to keep on hand., If you can plan a week's worth of menus ahead of time, you will be able to list everything that you need from the store. Match your grocery list to your menus, adding in extra items such as fruit and nuts. If you have a list ready, you'll be able to easily let your friends and family help you out by doing the shopping for you.Try planning only two options for breakfasts, two for lunch, and two for dinner. This will get you through the week, but cut down on the amount of ingredients you need to buy.
A full fridge will help ease your stress, so buy more than you think you might need at first. You'll find that with a new baby, it's much harder to pop out to the store if you need something.

Talk to your doctor.,
Understand the benefits.,
Know how your baby is affected.",How to Plan a Vegetarian Diet for a Breast Feeding Mom3," Don't forget that as a breastfeeding mom, you have special nutritional needs. This is especially true when you are following a vegetarian diet. Consult with your doctor before your baby is born and ask him for tips about your diet.When you take your baby for checkups, talk to your doctor about what you have been eating.
Ask plenty of questions. Let your doctor know if you have any concerns about your baby's development or nutritional needs.

, Research shows that breastfeeding is very beneficial for babies. It can have a major impact on your baby's health. Studies show that babies who are breastfed are less likely to have asthma or suffer from childhood obesity.Breastfeeding is also good for the environment, as it produces less waste than purchasing food.
Breastfeeding can make your life easier, as you don't have to worry about shopping for formula or baby food.

, When you are breastfeeding, it is important to remember that whatever you consume, your baby also consumes. Certain foods and drinks can cause your baby to suffer an allergic reaction or become irritable. If you are concerned, talk to your doctor.Avoid large amounts of caffeine and alcohol, as they can be harmful to your baby's health.

Do not eat much fish. Fish is good for you, but many varieties contain high levels of mercury, which can harm your baby. Do not eat more than 6 oz. of fish per week.

"
"
Consume up to 500 more calories a day.,
Have protein rich foods like lean meats, eggs, dairy, and beans.,
Eat a balanced diet of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.,
Try to eat a variety of different foods.,
Note any allergic reactions your baby has to foods that you eat.,
Ask your doctor about vitamin and mineral supplements.,
Increase your nutritional intake if you follow a vegetarian diet.",How to Make Breast Milk More Nutritious1," To maintain your energy, you can consume an additional 400 to 500 calories a day. It’s important that you go for nutrient-rich food sources for these extra calories and keep a close eye on not going over 500 extra calories a day.However, as you breastfeed, you are not required to increase your calorie intake and you can maintain a very similar diet to your diet when you were pregnant. Avoid over consuming on calories as this can stall your post-pregnancy weight loss, which is an important part of recovering from your pregnancy.;
, To give your breast milk higher nutritional value for your baby, maintain a diet that is rich in good sources of protein. Lean meat like chicken, as well as eggs, milk, beans, and lentils are all good additions to your diet.If you are maintaining a daily calorie intake of 2400 calories, you should have three cups a day of dairy, such as yogurt, milk, or cheese, as well as six and a half ounces of meat and beans, such as fish, lean meat, beans, and nuts.You should always look for seafood that is low in mercury to avoid increasing the mercury levels in your body. Shrimp, canned light tuna, pollack, and salmon are all good options.

, You should also maintain a good balance of vegetables, fruits, and sources of whole grains, like whole grain bread and brown rich. Remember to always wash your fruits and vegetables before consuming them to reduce your exposure, and your baby’s exposure, to pesticide residue.If you are maintaining a daily calorie intake of 2400 calories, aim for three cups a day of vegetables, such as leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale, orange vegetables like peppers and carrots, and starchy vegetables like squash and potatoes. You should also have two cups a day of a variety of fruits, and eight ounces of whole grains a day., Having a variety of foods as you breastfeed will actually change the flavor of your breast milk and expose your baby to different tastes. This will help your baby expand her palate and ease into solid foods when she gets older.Most babies will enjoy the flavors of food that come through your breast milk and most mothers do not need to avoid certain foods as they breastfeed.

, Sometimes, your baby can be sensitive to something you eat, like dairy products or spicy foods, and may display symptoms of an allergy. Keep in mind if your baby displays any sensitivity symptoms or an allergic reaction, she is responding to the food you ate and not to your breast milk itself. If you stop eating the foods that seem to bother your baby or eat less of it, the symptoms should fade on their own. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned about your baby’s reaction to the foods in your breast milk. Your baby may display symptoms of a reaction, including:A green stool that contains mucus and/or blood.
Diarrhea and vomiting.
A rash, eczema, hives, or dry skin.
Fussiness during and/or after feedings.
Crying for long periods of time and appearing inconsolable.
Waking suddenly in discomfort.
Wheezing or coughing.
If your baby displays any of these symptoms within minutes of breastfeeding or within 4 to 24 hours of breastfeeding, try to stop eating certain foods to determine the source of the allergy or sensitivity. If your baby has problems breathing, call 911 or head to the nearest emergency room.

, Your breast milk, coupled with a healthy balanced diet, should provide enough vitamins and minerals for you and your baby. But if you’re concerned about providing enough nutrients for both of you, talk to your doctor about taking vitamin and mineral supplements.Your doctor should check your vitamin A, D, B6, and B12 levels to ensure you have enough nutrients in your body. Undernourished mothers or mothers with health issues may need to take vitamins and minerals like vitamin D supplements and vitamin B12 supplements.

, Mothers who have a restrictive diet may require more nutrients through adjustments to their diet and vitamin supplements.Your diet should be high in foods that contain iron, protein, and calcium. This includes lentils, whole-grain products, peas, and dark leafy green vegetables. You should also eat citrus fruits to help your body absorb the iron in your food. Your diet should contain foods rich in protein like eggs and dairy products or plant based protein sources like tofu, soy milk, and soy yogurt.
Your doctor can also recommend daily vitamin B-12 supplements, which are essential for your baby’s brain development. You also may need vitamin D supplements if you have limited sun exposure and you do not eat vitamin-D rich foods like cow’s milk. Vitamin D is essential for your baby’s diet as it can help her absorb calcium and phosphorus.

Make sure that the bra fits well.,
Gather your supplies.,
Cut your bra straps.,
Sew in the clasps.,
Secure the elastic.,
Try your new bra.",How to Make a Nursing Bra1," Choosing a bra that you've had in your drawer for the past five years is probably not the best idea. It could be ill-fitting, damaged, or falling apart—there’s a reason why it stayed in your drawer for so long.The band on your new bra should fit properly on the last clasp so that you can tighten it as your bra stretches over time. The straps should feel comfortable and not like they are digging or pinching at your skin.Make sure there are no lumps or bulges.






If you haven’t been measured by a professional, do so right away. You can usually do so for free at your local department store.






Not only do regular bras work, but so do sports bras which some women prefer because they tend to be more comfortable and offer more support.






Negative effects of poorly fitting bras include clogged ducts or mastitis, which results in swollen, painful breasts that require antibiotic treatment.;
, There are only a few supplies required including thread that is the same color as the bra, nursing clips, elastic, sewing needles, and scissors.If you don’t have thread at home, any local fabric shop or store will have it.
As for elastic, plush elastic is recommended as it has a soft plush finish that is made for being in direct contact with the body.Nursing clips can also be purchased at a fabric store or online.

, On the front of the bra, cut about an inch above the seam where the strap and the cups meet. Make sure the fabric is pulled taut to make cutting easier.


Avoid using dull scissors. Opt for fabric scissors that you can find at your local crafts store.
Cut on a hard, flat surface like a table. Cutting on soft or uneven surfaces can result in inaccurate cutting.
Don’t cringe at the thought of cutting up an expensive bra. In order to make this conversion work for you, you have to use something that is well-made and of good quality.

, It is important to do this well in order to ensure your clasps are even and secure. Sew the bottom clasp to the end of the bra strap closest to the cup, and sew the top clasp onto the strap that goes over your shoulder.


Feel free to use your preferred stitch—satin or zig zag will do the trick. For those who aren't adept in sewing, a simple running stitch will work best.






For a running stitch, weave the needle in and out of the fabric to create a ""dashed"" look.The stitches should be approximately 1/8th of an inch.Remember, the only person who will be close enough to see stitching irregularities is your nursing baby so don't get bogged down with the type of stitching. Just make sure it is secure.Make sure to double check the clasps before sewing into place to ensure they aren't upside down or backwards.






Repeat the same process on the other bra strap.






When done sewing all four clasps, check to make sure they fit together and connect without issue.







, Cut a piece of elastic that is long enough to extend from the bottom of the cup to the top clasp. This will be sewn in to keep your bra strap from falling behind your back during nursing.This step is optional. Other women find that tucking their strap into their shirt works just fine.


Measure a piece of elastic that stretches from the top clasp to the bottom of the cup. Cut using a sharp pair of fabric scissors.






Pull your piece of elastic through the clip attached to the longer piece of the strap and sew into place using a running stitch.






Sew the bottom of the elastic piece to the bottom of the bra cup using a running stitch. Make sure to leave a little bit of slack.






Repeat the process on the other strap and cup.







, Put on your bra to ensure a proper fit and to ensure the clasps are working properly. Your bra should not be too tight, should not pinch your skin, and the straps should not fall down on their own. You should be able to unclasp one side and pull down the cup to expose one breast at a time.

Educate yourself while you’re pregnant.,
Consult with your lactation specialist before leaving the hospital.,
Position yourself correctly.,
Ensure proper latching.",How to Prevent Painful Breastfeeding1," Talk about your breastfeeding plans with your doctor or midwife before you give birth. They will be able to recommend books and other resources to help you learn proper breastfeeding procedures.Consider taking a class on the subject to prepare yourself.;
, Get a tutorial on breastfeeding from this lactation professional. Often they will sit with you for your first few feeding sessions to offer feedback and advice on proper and comfortable methods. This is an invaluable tool for new mothers.


You can even schedule appointments with a lactation consultant after you have your baby. However, keep in mind that these visits are not usually covered by insurance.
Another option is to look into community support groups for breastfeeding in your area.

, Sit comfortably and support your back with pillows or a cushion. Do not lean forward or bend over your baby; instead, hold the infant close to your body with their body facing yours and their head at the same level as your breast. With one hand, support your baby’s head. With the other hand, support and offer your breast by forming a “C” shape with your hand around, but not covering, the areola (the darker area around the nipple).You can put a pillow under the arm that is supporting the baby.

, Poor latching is a common cause of breastfeeding pain. When in your correct position, gently touch your nipple to your baby’s bottom lip to encourage them to open wide. You can also gently lower their chin to prompt them to open their mouth. Allow them to take your whole nipple and much of the areola in their mouth.When your baby is latched properly you shouldn’t get a pinching feeling on your nipple. Rather you should experience a slight pulling feeling on your breast."

Understand how induced lactation is possible.,
Understand the pros and cons.,
Prepare for the changes that will take place in your body.",How to Lactate1," Although it may seem surprising, it is indeed possible for women who are not or have not been pregnant to produce breast milk. This is usually undertaken by a mother who wishes to feed her adopted baby.


The body's production of breast milk is usually triggered by the complex interactions between three hormones - estrogen, progesterone and prolactin - during pregnancy.
If the production of these hormones can be mimicked through physical stimulation and/or hormone supplements, then breast milk can be produced outside of pregnancy.Prolactin ( the main hormone involved in milk production) is produced in the pituitary gland, not the ovaries. Therefore, it is possible for women to induce lactation even if their uterus has been removed. However, the induced lactation process is usually more successful in women who have previously been pregnant.
The induced lactation process can take several months, so it is a good idea to begin the process as soon as you have an idea of your adopted baby's arrival date. Adoptive mothers have the greatest chance of their baby ""latching-on"" successfully if the baby is younger than three months.;
, Inducing the production of breast milk is a huge undertaking, so the pros and cons should be carefully weighed before any final decisions are made.



Pros: Obviously the main advantage of producing your own breast milk is the benefit it will have for the baby. Breast milk contains important antibodies, proteins, fats and vitamins that will help your baby to grow and gain weight, and fight off infections and disease. In addition, breast feeding is wonderful, intimate way for mother and baby to bond. This is especially true when the baby is adopted, as the bonding process can take time. This is also the most natural method of feeding your baby, and can eliminate the need to use store-bought formulas which may contain chemicals.Cons: The major drawbacks of induced lactation mainly involve the time and effort required to be successful. Stimulating the production of milk requires huge dedication and commitment, as breast pumping and stimulation needs to be performed 6 to 12 times a day, including night-time sessions which involve waking up in the early a.m. This process can be painful and uncomfortable on your breasts, and if you're using hormone therapies, you may experience mood swings and disruptions to your menstrual cycle., Before you begin the process of inducing lactation, it's important to aware of what will happen to your body, and the possible side effects.


The side effects of induced lactation will be more severe if you are taking hormones, as you are essentially tricking your body into thinking you are pregnant. You can expect enlarged breasts, swollen or sore nipples and irregular menstruation.
You will probably experience fatigue and increased hunger, as your body believes it is eating for two. You should increase your calorie intake by about 200 calories per day, but try to make healthy food choices in order to minimize weight gain.
You may also experience mood swings and periods of depression and anger. This is why it is helpful to have a supportive partner, friend or family member to help you through the process and to remind you of the importance of the end goal. Your sex drive may also be affected by the hormones.

Be aware of the current medical recommendations.Doctors recommend six months of exclusive breastfeeding at the start of your baby's life, followed by at least six more months of partial breastfeeding complemented with other foods (until your baby is one year old).,
Boost your baby's immune system through breastfeeding.The antibodies (immune system molecules) passed on to your baby through breastmilk are perfectly designed to fit the needs of your baby.,
Provide tailored nutrition to your baby with breastmilk.Up until six months of age, your baby can feed off of breastmilk exclusively and receive all of the key nutrients they need, except for vitamin D (which many pediatricians will recommend for breastfeeding babies).,
Reduce digestive stress by breastfeeding.,
Explore the numerous other health benefits of breast milk.,
Be aware of the hormonal benefits that breastfeeding offers your body.It helps to diminish stress by releasing positive chemicals into your brain, which can help to cope with the many adaptations and changes of first having a baby.,
Know the possible contraceptive effects of breastfeeding.,
Help yourself to lose weight post-pregnancy via breastfeeding.Moms that breastfeed and eat a well-balanced diet as they try to lose weight find it easier to shed pounds than mothers who bottle feed.,
Save money by breastfeeding.You will not have to purchase bottles, refill bags, replacement nipples, bottle cleaners or the many cases of formula it will take to feed your baby if you are not breastfeeding.,
Welcome the ease of feeding your baby from the breast.,
Know that research shows overall health benefits for the mother, too.",How to Know Why Breastfeeding Is Best," Between six to 12 months, you should start adding solid foods into your baby's diet, as breastmilk alone will no longer be sufficient to meet all of your baby's growth and nutrient needs after six months.Interestingly, despite medical recommendations, only 79% of women in the United States breastfeed initially, and this number drops to 46% of women who have continued breastfeeding through to six months.
Doctors are hoping to increase the percentage of women who are compelled to breastfeed by providing the latest evidence in support of its benefits, both to the baby and to you as a mother.
Physicians recommend breastfeeding except in rare cases, such as if the mother has an illness that is transmittable through breastmilk such as HIV, or if the mother has other problems with breastmilk or breastfeeding. If you worry this may apply to you, speak to your family doctor, your obstetrician (a specialist), or a lactation consultant (someone who specializes in breastfeeding) for further information.
Certain medications are not compatible with breastfeeding so women on regular medications should consult their doctor.;
,


As a result, breastfeeding diminishes your baby's likelihood of catching an infection, and also increases his or her capacity to fight off any bugs he or she may come in contact with early in life.
This means less of a chance of your baby getting respiratory infections, ear infections, or other illnesses.

, The breastmilk even naturally changes in composition as your baby grows, in order to be a perfect nutrient match — one that is so specifically tailored to your baby's growth that it cannot be fully matched by any store-bought formula.

, Breastfed babies experience fewer episodes of diarrhea, suffer less gastrointestinal problems, and have a reduced risk of food allergies.In addition, studies indicate that the benefits are carried over into adulthood by lowering the risk of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.

, For instance, research shows that breastfed babies have a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), although the reasons for this are not fully understood.


Breastfeeding has also been linked to reduced rates of certain childhood cancers (mainly leukemias), as well as to diminished rates of cardiovascular (heart) disease, diabetes, and obesity.In addition, breastfed babies suffer less from skin disorders than do formula fed babies.
Research has also shown that babies that are breastfed for at least 12 months have a higher IQ.

,


Breastfeeding also diminishes post-pregnancy bleeding. This is because it stimulates the release of a particular hormone, called oxytocin, which helps the uterus to contract more quickly and lessens bleeding after the birth.Oxytocin (known as the ""love hormone"") also promotes bonding with your baby, and helps to strengthen the relationship you share.

, Breastfeeding, if done continually, can sometimes serve as contraception (birth control) for up to six months. This is because the hormone balance created in your body while breastfeeding is not conducive to becoming pregnant with another child. This is not, however, the case for all women — some women will get pregnant while nursing, so don't consider it a fool-proof method of birth control.


If you don't want to get pregnant again while nursing, then you need to utilize another form of birth control.
Breastfeeding will also postpone the return of your period.

, Breastfeeding automatically burns calories every time you produce new milk, which equates to approximately 500 calories per day for the average nursing mother.

,


Infant feeding costs are estimated to cost around $1,000 USD for the first year.
Also, due to the increased immune system function of a baby who is breastfed, you will save yourself money from visits to the paediatrician for potential illnesses., It is always available without waiting for preparation. There is no need to get up to prepare a bottle or heat the formula before offering it to your baby.


Also, consider your breastfeeding as an environmentally friendly gesture. Think of all the trash you will not be contributing as waste.

, It has been proven medically that women who breastfeed have a lower risk of developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer, postpartum depression, and type 2 diabetes."
"
Drink water after every feeding.,
Limit yourself to less than three cups of coffee or caffeinated beverages a day.,
Limit alcohol while breastfeeding.",How to Make Breast Milk More Nutritious2," Your fluid intake does not affect the amount of breast milk you produce, but you should drink when you’re thirsty and try to drink water after every feeding. Try to stick to just water and avoid drinks high in added sugars, like soft drinks and fruit drinks., Be careful about consuming too much caffeine, as it can cause your baby to act fussy and not sleep well. You can drink a moderate amount, up to three cups a day of coffee or other caffeinated beverages., It is okay to have a drink now and then while you are breast feeding. A small amount of alcohol in your breast milk is unlikely to harm your baby, especially if your baby is more than a few months old.If you have more an one drink, then you may want to avoid breast-feeding until the alcohol has been cleared out of your system.Depending on your body weight, 12 ounces of 5 percent beer, 5 ounces of 11 percent wine, or 1.5 ounces of 40 percent liquor takes two to three hours to clear out of your body.
Do not try to pump and dump your breast milk in an attempt to speed up the removal of the alcohol from your breast milk, as this will not work. The best course is to wait a sufficient amount of time for the alcohol to clear your system.

Choose a bra.,
Gather supplies.,
Cut the bra extenders.,
Connect the hooks to the eyes.,
Cut the straps of the bra.,
Connect and sew the hook.,
Sew the eye piece to the strap.,
Try your new bra.",How to Make a Nursing Bra2," Choose a bra that fits both your body and your personal taste. A bra with wider straps will work better because you'll be sewing part of a bra extender to the straps.

, The list of materials includes fabric scissors, needle and thread (the same color as your bra), and a bra extender (preferably the same color as your bra).


The bra extender will need to have at least 2 hooks. Most bra extenders have hooks that are similar to regular back clasping bras. They can be found at your local retail store and usually come in 3 colors: black, white, and nude.

, Using scissors, cut off the hook end of the extender. You'll want to cut at about the first seam so that you form a pocket to tuck the bra strap into later.Use fabric scissors that are strong enough to cut through the thick material.


Be sure to cut on a flat surface to ensure you are able to cut straight across the seam.

, Connect the hooks you just cut with the corresponding eyes. Cut down the middle of the eyes, creating two long rows of one hook and multiple eyes.These cuts do not have to be as accurate.

, Using fabric scissors, cut at the top where the strap meets the cup. There is no need to measure, but pull the material taut to ensure an easier cut.

, Fit the pocket part of the hook over the cut strap. Make sure the hook faces inward towards your body, and that the hook faces downward (like an upside down ""J"").Sew into place using a stitch that suits your abilities. A zig-zag stitch on a sewing machine works best but a running stitch will also do the job.






For a running stitch, weave the needle and thread in and out of the fabric, creating a ""dashed"" effect. The dashes should be about 1/8th of an inch in length.






This stitch is good for very small spaces such as this project.






Make sure it is attached in a straight and secure manner to avoid discomfort later.Repeat on the other strap.







, Position it so that the lowermost metal eye aligns with the bottom of the strap without extending past it. Make sure you are sewing the eye piece to the front of the bra, and that the eyes are facing downward.


Use the zig-zag setting on your sewing machine or a running stitch if you're hand stitching.






Repeat on the other strap.







, Put on your bra to ensure a proper fit and to ensure the hooks and eyes connect properly. Your bra should not be too tight, should not pinch your skin, and the straps should not fall down on their own. You should be able to unsnap one side and pull down the cup to expose one breast at a time.

Find or buy a camisole.,
Cut the straps.,
Loop rubber bands.,
Put on your garments.,
Connect your camisole to your bra.",How to Make a Nursing Bra3," You will still need a nursing bra with clasps for this method. Find a camisole that has rings where the straps connect to the body. This will allow you to connect your cami to your nursing bra without any sewing.


This method is perfect for women who are self-conscious about the baby weight around their stomach, or women who want more coverage as they breast feed.
This method allows you to pull your cami down without stretching or ripping the fabric, or having to hold it down with your hand.
Choose quality material like strong cotton or a cotton blend that won’t stretch out or tear easily.
Camis come in more colors than black, beige, or white (like other underwear). Feel free to choose colors that fit your personality and style.

, Using a pair of fabric scissors, cut the straps from the front and back of your cami. Leave the rings attached to the body of the cami. Straps can be disposed of or recycled as they will no longer be used.


Be sure to cut on a flat, hard surface to avoid mistakes in cutting.
On the back of the cami, cut in a quick, smooth motion to avoid fraying of the top.

, Choose small, black rubber bands that are usually used for hair styling. Take one rubber band and loop it around the ring, then pull it through to create a slip knot.Repeat on both sides of the cami.

, Put on your nursing bra followed by your newly made camisole. Make sure the garments aren't too tight and don't pinch your skin anywhere. Also make sure that your breasts are not constricted by the layers of garments.

, Unclasp your nursing bra and loop the rubber bands around the clasps of your bra. Re-clasp your bra and your nursing tank will stay attached until feeding time.When ready for use, unclasp one side of your nursing bra and pull down to expose your breast. The cami will follow while still keeping your stomach covered.
Be sure to remove rubber bands before washing and drying your tank. They can be easily reattached after laundering.

Nurse your baby on a regular schedule.,
Discourage biting.,
Alternate your breasts for feedings.,
Express milk regularly to prevent engorgement.,
Wear supportive, but not overly tight, bras and clothing.,
Keep clothes and pumping gear clean with thorough washings.,
Delay giving your baby a pacifier.,
Stay hydrated.,
Wean your baby from breastfeeding gradually.",How to Prevent Painful Breastfeeding2," Infants eat fairly regularly, usually about every two to three hours. Nurse on a consistent schedule. If you wait too long to feed, your baby may be more likely to bite down on your nipple.Keep in mind that babies tend to bite when they are really hungry, so pay attention to your baby’s signals to avoid letting them become too hungry.
Every baby is different, so keep an eye out for your infant’s feeding patterns. Watch for signs that your baby is getting hungry, like moving their mouth, making suction motions, crying or becoming restless.This might indicate you should feed more frequently.

, It’s not uncommon for your baby to bite down on your nipple when they develop teeth. You should gently discourage this and train your baby not to bite. When a bite happens, remain calm but briefly stop feeding and firmly tell your baby, “No.”When removing your baby from your breast, hug them closer in towards your breast rather than pulling them off of you. They will usually let go when this happens.If biting is due to teething, give your baby your finger or a teething toy before and after nursing.

, Allow your baby to fully drain the milk from one breast before moving to the other breast. This usually takes 15-20 minutes, but every baby is different; your breast will feel softer once it is empty.Then offer the other breast, or begin with the other breast for the next feeding.


Start feeding on the least sore breast first, unless the cause is mastitis or engorgement.

, If you are between feedings and your breasts are feeling overly full and tender, express a little milk by rubbing or massaging them gently. Use a breast pump to relieve pressure and save milk for your baby if you work full time or are otherwise away from your baby during the day. Try to pump every few hours., Putting unnecessary pressure on your breast with a tight bra or blouse might affect how milk can flow through the ducts. This can lead to mastitis or a blocked duct, two causes of painful breastfeeding. You want bras to support full breasts without squeezing or constricting them.

, Keep your breasts free from bacteria or yeast that cause infections. Nipples can develop yeast infections, causing sharp or burning pain that lasts throughout a whole feeding.Keep bras, pumping equipment, and nursing pads clean by washing them frequently.


Wash your hands before and after you breastfeed.
Do not use shampoo or harsh soap on your nipples; avoid using bath products that can irritate your skin.Gentle cleaning with warm water should be sufficient.

, Wait to give your baby a pacifier until their feeding habits are well-developed, usually after 3-4 weeks. Sucking on a pacifier can teach them poor habits, since a pacifier differs from a nipple.Once they have the hang of feeding, it’s okay to introduce a pacifier.

, Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water every day. Staying hydrated can help to prevent painful causes of breastfeeding like a blocked duct., If you abruptly stop breastfeeding, you will likely experience painful engorgement. Make it a slow process by gradually decreasing how frequently and for how long you nurse every day. Do this over a few weeks, or even months.Use a cold compress on your breast if you do have uncomfortable swelling during this time.

"
"
Heal chapped or cracked nipples with lanolin.,
Use a heating pad on a blocked milk duct.,
Treat mastitis.,
Check for tongue-tie.",How to Prevent Painful Breastfeeding3," Nipple irritation, drying, and cracking is common with breastfeeding mothers. Use purified lanolin on cracked nipples after you feed your baby.You can also dab some of your own breastmilk onto sore nipples, which can be soothing.


Gently pat wet nipples dry. Rubbing them can cause further irritation. You can also dry them with a hair dryer on the cool setting.

, Blocked ducts usually cause a firm, swollen mass in the breast tissue and cause the skin over it to redden slightly. Blocks usually resolve on their own in a day or two, but do what you can to resolve them quickly to minimize discomfort.Use a heating pad or hot water bottle on the area to soothe it.


Try to unblock the duct by continuing to feed from that breast – get a good latch, and gently squeeze around the duct with your hand as your baby suckles. You can also massage the lump towards the nipple. This may help the breast drain better.
Take lecithin supplement (1200mg, 4 times daily) to help prevent blocked ducts., Mastitis is an infection in the breast that usually occurs due to bacteria getting in through a cracked nipple. You will have a warm, swollen, painful lump in the breast, and probably a fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher. If you suspect that you may have mastitis, then call your doctor right away for antibiotic treatment.You do not have to stop breastfeeding when you have mastitis. In fact, continue to feed from the affected side. This can help to clear the infection, and causes no harm to your baby.A blocked duct can lead to mastitis.
Make mastitis more comfortable by placing hot compresses or water bottles over the tender area.

, Tongue-tie, or ankyloglossia, occurs when the thin tissue connecting your baby’s tongue to the bottom of their mouth is unusually short. This makes it more difficult for them to move their tongue, and can increase the pain of breastfeeding. Check whether your baby’s tongue is shaped like a heart at the tip, or ask your doctor to check at your next visit.Tongue-tie is easily fixed with a simple procedure.

Start taking hormones.,
Use an electric breast pump.,
Stimulate milk production manually.,
Allow your baby to suckle.",How to Lactate2," There are a number of different hormones that can be used to simulate pregnancy and stimulate the production of breast milk.


The most widely used hormone is domperidone, which suppresses the body's production of dopamine and therefore indirectly increases the amount of prolactin in your system, which is the hormone directly responsible for breast development and the production of milk.
Sometimes, additional hormones are recommended for use alongside the domperidone, such as estrogen and progesterone. Having higher amounts of these hormones in your system helps to mimic your body's natural state during pregnancy. If you are under the age of 35, you can take these hormones using the estrogen-progesterone combination birth control pill.
If you have time before the arrival of your adopted child, it is recommended that you begin your ""fake pregnancy"" six to nine months in advance (however, there are accelerated programs for people with less time). Start taking the three hormones recommended above, following the dosages recommended by a qualified lactation consultant.
Keep taking the hormones over the course of several months, until approximately six weeks before the baby's arrival. Then you should abruptly stop taking the progesterone and estrogen, thus tricking your body into believing you have given birth.
Keep taking the domperidone and begin physical stimulation of the breasts using an electric pump or other manual techniques. The milk should start to arrive in as little as a few days, or as long as two weeks. Once it arrives, you should continue taking the domperidone until you achieve a substantial milk supply, or the baby is ready to be weaned.Taking hormones without adequate medical supervision can result in serious side-effects. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you set up an appointment with a qualified lactation consultant at a hospital or clinic before you start the process., If you are using the hormone method of inducing lactation, you will also need to use a breast pump. However, it is sometimes possible to produce breast milk using the pump alone, although it can take a little longer.


Physical stimulation of the nipples triggers the release of the prolactin hormone, which aids in the development of the mammary glands and stimulates milk production. It also releases oxytocin, the key hormone necessary for the release, or ""let down"", of milk.
The best equipment for the job is a hospital-grade electric breast pump, which allows you to pump both breasts at the same time. These are expensive, but are worth the money if you consider the amount of time you'll spend using them. You can also use hand pumps, however the motorized versions are better at simulating the sucking motions of an infant.
If you decide to go down the breast pump only route, you will need to begin pumping at least two months before the arrival of the baby. You will need to set a strict schedule, pumping every 2 to 3 hours, for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.
You will also need to include at least one nighttime pumping session, as your body's natural prolactin levels are highest between 1 am and 5am, so it's important to take advantage of this fact.
Before you begin pumping, use your hands to to gently massage your breasts and nipples. This will make them erect and ready for pumping. Apply the pump to both breasts simultaneously, doing your best to keep your nipples centered.
Turn the pump on to a low suction and high speed, as this best mimics the rapid suckling motion of a baby. As you get used to pumping, you can gradually increase to a medium suction, or as high as you can comfortably go without making your nipples sore.
Don't panic if you're not seeing any milk at first. It can take weeks before you see a single drop. Just stay calm and focused and stick to your schedule - the milk will come.

, Instead of using a breast pump, it is possible to induce lactation by hand, using nipple stimulation and breast massage.


Producing breast milk this way will take more time and require greater effort than the previous two methods, but it is more natural than using hormones and cheaper than buying a breast pump.
In terms of technique, you will need to use both hands to massage around the entire breast - almost as if you were giving yourself a breast exam. Then you will need to stimulate your nipples and areolas using your fingers and thumbs, massaging them and rolling them between your fingers. Try to press the areolas as you pull the nipples, as this is the motion that best replicates an infant's sucking.
You will need to do this at least 8 times a day (including one nighttime session) for about 20 minutes at a time. If you feel comfortable with it, you can enlist the help of your partner or a close friend to massage with you. In order to have milk in time for the baby's arrival, you will need to start this process at least two months in advance.
As you get closer to producing milk, you will need to lean over, so both of your breasts are pointed towards the floor. Gently shake your breasts, as this allows any potential milk to make its way towards the nipples.
You may find it necessary to purchase a nipple lubricant or balm to protect your nipples from chaffing and becoming sore. However, no matter how sore your nipples become, it's important not to give up. Try to persevere and remember how how glad you will be once your baby arrives.

, If your baby has already arrived but you still have not produced any breast milk, don't worry. Allowing your baby to suckle on your nipple, even if they are not receiving any milk, will help to speed up the process.


Instead of pumping or manually stimulating your breasts, simply allow your baby to latch on. A baby's natural sucking motion is the best possible way of stimulating the hormones necessary to produce milk. That's because the entire experience - from the feeling of the baby's mouth on your nipple to the suckling sounds your baby makes - feels a lot more real than pumping or manual stimulation.
In fact, the production of breast milk is as much a psychological process as a physical one. The knowledge that your baby is present and needs milk can be enough to trigger a natural let down response from your body.
The only issue with this method is that babies can become frustrated if they are attempting to feed but are not receiving any milk. To solve this problem, you can invest in a lactation aid. This is a simple device, consisting of a tube that attaches to the mother's nipple on one end and a bag of formula on the other. In this way, the baby receives food while the nipple is stimulated, eventually allowing the mother to produce her own milk.
Even if you never achieve a full milk supply, the simple act of breast feeding your baby is an important and irreplaceable bonding experience, which allows you to connect with your adopted child in a special and intimate way. When you look at it this way, any milk you produce is a bonus.
If your baby has not yet arrived, you can still use the suckling method to induce lactation - you just need to get your partner to do it instead. This requires a huge commitment from both partners, but can be quite effective and can actually create a deeper connection between the two of you. Some couples also do this for erotic reasons, even when there is no baby involved. However, if you are doing it for milk, it is essential that your partner learns the correct latching on and suckling technique, and that you stick to a strict schedule."

Take herbal supplements.,
Drink lots of water.,
Eat oatmeal.,
Get into the right frame of mind.",How to Lactate3," Many women recommend herbal supplements to naturally increase the supply of breast. The most popular and effective herbs are fenugreek seed and blessed thistle herb.


In terms of dosage, it is recommended that you take three capsules of fenugreek seed (containing 390mg per capsule) and three capsules of blessed thistle herb (containing 610mg per capsule) three times a day, with food. You should start taking these supplements as soon as you start pumping milk.
You can also purchase an herbal tea known as ""Mother's Milk"", which contains a blend fennel, coriander, fenugreek, blessed thistle and aniseed. It tastes like licorice and can be sweetened with honey or sugar, if desired. It should be drunk up to three times a day, directly before feedings.
In addition to encouraging increased milk production, this tea may also help to reduce gas and colic symptoms in babies.

, Water is used in the production of breast milk, therefore it is very important to stay hydrated throughout the breast feeding process.


It is recommended that breast-feeding mothers drink between 6 and 8 glasses of water per day to avoid dehydration. You can also drink herbal teas and eat fruit and veg with a high water content to increase hydration.
You can tell if you are dehydrated by looking at the color of your urine. It will be very light or straw yellow in color if you are adequately hydrated and will be dark yellow if you are dehydrated.
It's a good idea to cut back on coffee and other caffeinated drinks while you are breastfeeding, as these are diuretics which cause rapid fluid loss., A common recommendation for breastfeeding mothers is to eat oatmeal in order to increase milk supply.


There isn't much scientific evidence to explain why, but many breastfeeding moms notice an increase in their milk production on days when they eat oatmeal for breakfast.
Some theories include the fact that oatmeal contains high levels of iron and helps to reduce cholesterol - both of which are important for healthy milk production.
Aside from those reasons, oatmeal is a warming comfort food which provides lots of energy - two things that new mothers definitely need., If your baby has not yet arrived and you are finding it difficult to increase your milk supply, then you may need to work on the psychological side of lactation.


As you are pumping or manually stimulating your breasts, it's important to focus on the reason you are doing it - to feed your baby. This will help your body's natural maternal instincts to kick in and promote milk production and let down.
If you are having trouble visualizing the need for milk, you can use some props to help you. Hold a photo of the baby you are adopting, watch videos of mothers nursing their babies online, or listen to the sound of a baby suckling. Even holding an article of baby's clothing or a baby blanket can help.

Don’t be afraid of odd colors and textures.,
Be careful with milk that is three days old.,
Test for sour smell.,
Don’t fret over a metallic or soapy smell.",How to Know when Expressed Breast Milk Is Spoiled1," It is common for the color and the texture of your milk to change. Much of this reflects the changing dietary needs of your baby. Appearance is no way to judge the freshness of milk .It is common for the color of milk to change during the course of storage or even a single feeding. It is natural for the milk to occasionally have a bluish, greenish, yellowish, or even brownish color.
It is also common for it to separate into layer of lighter milk and more dense cream. This is not dangerous, but you should gently swirl it to mix the two together.;
, Expressed milk can often last much longer than this, but its shelf life varies considerably depending upon the details of its storage. After three days in the refrigerator, you should smell the milk carefully to verify that it is fresh.Similarly, you should be careful if the milk has been out for three hours without being refrigerated.It is okay to store milk at room temperature from three to six hours depending on how cool the room is. If you are storing milk in an insulated cooler, it is safe to leave it in the cooler for 24 hours.

, Sour breast milk has the same strong, distinctive smell that sour cow milk has. This is the one and only meaningful way to determine if milk is rancid., Some mothers will find that their milk will over time develop a soap like or metallic taste if stored. This taste is not a sign of spoilage and most babies do not mind it.


If your baby does reject it, try scalding it before storing to halt the development of this smell.

Store in the back of the fringe.,
Store in a tightly sealed container.,
Date containers of milk.,
Freeze the milk.,
Scald milk with a soapy flavor.",How to Know when Expressed Breast Milk Is Spoiled2," Keeping the milk on or near the door will expose it to more heat or temperature fluctuations from the opening and closing of the refrigerator. In the back the milk will be colder and more likely to keep., Glass, disposable bottle liners, or “mother’s milk” bags are best. Polypropylene or polybutylene hard plastics are preferable to soft plastic polyethylene bags.


It is also important to ensure that other containers in the fridge are closed tightly so that that the milk does not absorb these other odors.
A box of baking soda in the refrigerator can help absorb other smells., Writing the date you expressed the milk on the container can help you make sure you use the older milk first and before it spoils. You can label each container or put all milk from the same week or month together in a bag or box that is labeled.

, If you do not plan to use the milk in five to eight days, you should freeze it. Place it in a tightly sealed container in the back of the freezer. Use within 24 hours after thawing.Depending upon how frequently you open the freezer, your milk can last for anywhere from three months to a year.Do not use a microwave to thaw the milk. Thaw it under warm, running water. Do not bring to boil.
It is natural for it to separate into milk and cream while frozen. Swirl it gently to mix these together., If you find that your milk has a soapy flavor and that this is a problem for your baby, you should scald it. Heat to about 180 °F (82.2 °C) (it should show signs of a full bubble, but not a rolling boil). Immediately afterward cool and store the milk.


If this flavor does not bother your child, do not scald it. The milk will lose some of its nutrients in the process."
"
Don't consume alcohol when your baby is feeding.,
Cut out any allergens that you notice.,
Learn your baby's preferences.",How to Know What Foods to Avoid While Breastfeeding1," No amount of alcohol is acceptable or safe for your baby to consume. Breastfeeding after you have had any alcoholic beverage will potentially transfer some of that alcohol to your baby, which is dangerous. Always wait for your body to fully process and remove the alcohol before breastfeeding your baby.Generally you will need to wait around two hours per drink before you can safely breastfeed again.
One drink is considered 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz or liquor.
You cannot “pump and dump” to remove the alcohol from your breast milk. Only time will remove the alcohol from your body.
Never drink while you are caring for any baby.;
, Eating certain foods and then breastfeeding may cause an allergic reaction in your baby. Carefully watch your baby for any signs of allergic reactions after breastfeeding. If you notice any allergic reactions, think back to any foods you may have recently eaten or any new foods in your diet. These foods will need to be removed from your diet.The most common symptom of an allergic reaction can be found in your baby's stool. Any stool that is mucous-like, green, and blood-specked will indicate a potential allergic reaction.
Allergic reactions may also cause your baby to become fussy, develop a rash, get diarrhea, become constipated, or in some extreme cases may cause difficulty breathing.
If you notice any signs of allergic reaction, take your child to the pediatrician as soon as possible.Common foods that may cause allergic reactions are peanuts, soy, wheat, cow's milk, corn or eggs.
Keep a food diary to have an accurate list of what you have eaten recently. This will allow you to discover which foods might be responsible for the allergy.

, Your baby may simply not enjoy the taste that some foods can add to breast milk. Food and drink that have naturally strong flavors or taste can transfer these flavors into breast milk, causing your baby to not want to eat. Keep track of what you are eating and when your baby seems to react to learn which foods your baby doesn't like.


Try keeping a food log so that you can more easily remember what you ate, when you ate it, and which foods you might want to stop eating.

"
"
Consume a minimum of 1,800 calories a day and drink at least 6 glasses of fluids while you are lactating.,
Consult your doctor about using prescription or herbal supplements to increase breast milk.,
Supplement feedings with pumping.,
Limit the use of pacifiers and bottles while you're trying to make more breast milk.",How to Increase Breast Milk Production1," If you're currently dieting, it could be decreasing your milk production. Unsurprisingly, what you eat has a big impact on the quality and quantity of the milk produced. Here are some general guidelines for you to remember about diet and breast milk:


Find excellent sources of calcium. These will help your little baby's little bones grow healthy and strong. Calcium-rich foods include dairy products (opt for organic dairy products, however), leafy green vegetables, and certain fish (sardines and salmon).
Eat fruits and vegetables. Make fruits and vegetables a big part of your diet, as they are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
Opt for complex carbohydrates. Complex carbs are healthier than processed carbs, which you may by and large avoid. Complex carbs include such things as brown rice, whole-grain pasta and bread, as well as beans.
Opt for lean meat. Lean meat is better than fatty cuts. Think skinless chicken breast, fish, low-fat dairy products, and soy products like tofu.;
, Herbs that work well include fenugreek, blessed thistle and red raspberry. The prescription drug metoclopramide is sometimes used as a last resort by doctors to treat low milk production in nursing mothers.

, Pumping is beneficial for two reasons. First, pumping allows you to store breast milk when your baby doesn't need it, allowing you amass and store more expressed milk. Second, pumping stimulates the production of more breast milk.Invest in a high-quality pump. Pumping isn't exactly the spice of life, so it pays to invest in one that works well. You can rent a hospital-grade pump if you don't own a high-quality, double pump.
Whether you are at work or at home, consider pumping for 15 minutes every couple of hours. Either that, or pump for 5 to 10 minutes after nursing. Pumping at least 8 times during a 24-hour period will help to quickly increase breast milk production. If you can't pump immediately after nursing, try to pump halfway in between feedings.
Pump both breasts at the same time. Pumping both breasts will give you twice as much breast milk twice as fast in addition to helping stimulate more production.

, This makes sure all your baby's sucking needs are met at the breast. As the baby gets older, it will be easier for him to go back and forth from breast to pacifier without you losing important breast stimulation. If you are using bottles for supplementing, try to replace those with a syringe or spoon.

"
"
Watch the level of spice in your diet.,
Eat the right kinds of fish.,
Cut back on caffeine.,
Monitor your intake of certain vegetables.",How to Know What Foods to Avoid While Breastfeeding2," Eating spicy foods won't cause any harm to your baby when you are breastfeeding. However, some of that spicy flavor may transfer into your breast milk and your baby might not enjoy it as much as you do. If you notice your baby becoming fussy or refusing to eat after you've eaten something spicy, try eliminating those spices from your diet., While fish can be a great addition to your diet, providing omega-3 fatty acids and protein, some fish can also contain contaminants. Eating these fish can cause contaminants, such as mercury, to enter your breast milk. Since your baby will be extremely sensitive to these contaminants, you will want to avoid consuming large amounts of certain types of fish.The main types of fish to avoid are tilefish, king mackerel, and swordfish.
Eat no more than 6 ounces of fish a week.
Contaminants such as mercury can affect your baby's nervous system.

, While the levels that can be found in breast milk are not considered to be harmful to your baby, they can still have an effect. Babies who are consuming caffeine through breast milk can have difficulty sleeping or become agitated. Limit the amount of caffeine that you drink daily to keep it out of your breast milk.Do not drink more than 2 to 3 cups of coffee per day.

, Some vegetables can cause adults to become gassy. If you are eating these and breast feeding, it may also lead to your baby becoming gassy. Watch you baby for signs of excessive gas and try to avoid eating any foods that may be causing it. Keep an eye out for some known foods that can cause excess gas:Broccoli
Beans
Cabbage
Cauliflower
Chewing Gums
Onions
Whole-grain foods

Get enough fruits and vegetables.,
Make sure proteins are a part of your diet.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat the right amount.,
Try adding supplements to your diet.",How to Know What Foods to Avoid While Breastfeeding3," Getting plenty of fruits and vegetables in your diet can be a great way to improve your own health as well as the quality of your breast milk. Eating certain vegetables and fruits can be a great way to get iron, protein and calcium.Eat around 2 to 4 servings of fruit everyday.
Get 3 to 5 servings of vegetables per day in your diet.

, Getting enough protein in your diet is important if you are breast feeding your baby. You will need to make sure that you are getting the right amount of protein in your daily diet to keep your baby's diet balanced and healthy.Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese can provide protein, as well as calcium.
Lean meat, chicken, or fish are good sources of protein.
Legumes, lentils, seeds and nuts are good plant based sources of protein.

, Breast feeding can cause women to feel dehydrated or thirsty. It is important that you are drinking enough fluids every day to stay hydrated. Drink enough water to satisfy feelings of thirst, without feeling like you are forcing extra hydration.


On average women should drink around 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water every day. Women who are breastfeeding may need to increase this amount.
Water, juice, soup and skim-milk are healthy choices that can hydrate.
Try to drink around 8 cups of water per day.
Avoid sugary drinks such as soda or juices with sugar added.

, You will need to eat the appropriate amount of food during the time you are breastfeeding. In addition to eating an amount of food that will allow you to maintain a healthy weight, you will need some extra calories to maintain energy while breastfeeding.For the first 6 months of your baby's life, you will need around 500 to 600 extra calories a day.

, Generally it is recommended that you add dietary supplements to your daily diet. This can help ensure that you are getting proper nutrition during the time you are breastfeeding and provide the healthiest milk for your baby.Vitamin B-12 is important in the development of your baby's brain.
Vitamin D is critical in building strong bones and avoiding rickets in your baby.

Relax.,
Allow your baby to nurse frequently for as long as he wants.,
Practice undressing your baby to stimulate skin-to-skin contact during breast feeding.Undressing your baby while he breast feeds may help him feed longer.,
Try sling feeding.,
Offer your baby both breasts at every feeding to let your body know to make more breast milk.,
Try taking a nursing ""vacation.",How to Increase Breast Milk Production2," Loads of stress can hurt your ability to produce milk.Try to relax before pumping or breastfeeding by playing soothing music, looking at pictures that produce happiness, or just having a moment with the love of your life.


If you want to, try putting warm compresses on your breasts or massaging them for a short period right before you intend to pump or breastfeed.

, The more often your breasts are stimulated, the more milk your body makes. At least 8 feedings in a 24-hour period is ideal, more if possible. If you normally feed on a set schedule, allow the baby to feed on demand to increase your breast milk production.

, (Longer sessions mean more production of breast milk.)


Undress your baby down to his diaper, but drape a blanket over his back to ensure that he doesn't get cold.
Take off your bra and wear a shirt that can be unbuttoned on the front to promote skin-to-skin contact.

, Wearing a sling and keeping your baby close to the ultimate food supply should encourage him to feast more frequently. Some babies tend to feed more when on the move.

, Switch breasts as soon as your baby slows down. It's best if you can switch again and offer each breast twice during a single feeding session. Let your baby nurse for as long as possible-until he falls asleep or detaches.

,""For a day or two, take your baby to bed with you and do nothing but nurse when the urge hits your baby. Of course, you get to go to the kitchen and the bathroom and hit other motherly duties, but this vacation is all about you and your newborn.


During this vacation, take advantage of nap nursing, which is exactly what it sounds: sleeping with your baby ever-close to his favorite food. This relaxes both mother and child. It also increases the stimulation of milk-producing hormones.

This can stimulate prolactin production. Start by pumping for 5 minutes, three times daily. Gradually increase this to pumping for 10 minutes every four hours, and then to 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours. Keep doing this until the baby is born.The goal is not to actually produce milk, but to stimulate your nipples and breasts to produce more prolactin.;
, The more your breasts are stimulated, the more prolactin your body produces.Breastfeed on a regular schedule as often as you can, and use a mechanical pump daily, even after feedings. When you start to transition your baby to bottles, formulas, or soft foods, pump your breasts every time you feed your baby.Pumping after you feed can drain your breast of the milk your baby left behind, stimulating further prolactin production.Aim to use your pump for 30 minutes on each breast daily., Some mothers find that the herb fenugreek may increase milk supply, likely by increasing prolactin. Get capsules at your drug store or health food store, or by ordering them online in 610mg capsules. Try taking 2 capsules 3 times daily with food. If you have no side effects, you can gradually increase the dose to 4 capsules 3 times daily.A normal side effect is that your urine and sweat may start to smell like maple syrup.


Diarrhea may occur, but resolves when you stop taking the herb.
Do not take fenugreek if you are pregnant, or have a peanut or chickpea allergy.
Take it with your doctor’s supervision if you’re diabetic or have asthma – asthma symptoms may be worsened, and fenugreek can cause low blood sugar. It may also affect your thyroid function., Whole grain oats contain a protein that may increase prolactin, so incorporate them into your meals regularly. The same goes for quinoa and seeds, especially sesame seeds."

Determine if the person is open to a conversation.,
Consult scientific literature.,
Emphasize the benefits for the baby.,
Define how breastfeeding improves the mother’s health.,
Send people interesting information about breastfeeding.,
Avoid judging other mothers.",How to Educate Others on the Importance of Breastfeeding1," While you may want to educate all new and expecting parents on the benefits of breastfeeding, you should understand when such a conversation is appropriate. Gently ask the person, ""how are going to feed your baby?""If they answer they are going to breastfeed, ask them if they have any questions. You can say, ""That's great! Do you have any questions about it that I can answer?""
If they answer that they are going to bottle-feed, you can ask, ""Do you mind if I ask about your reasons?"" If they don't want to answer, stop the conversation. It may be a personal issue that they are not willing to discuss.
If they are not certain, you can ask, ""Do you have any questions about breastfeeding that I can answer? I might be able to help you decide."";
, There are many myths on the internet about healthcare and breastfeeding. If you are going to educate others, you want to make sure that you are providing accurate information. As you research, try to find resources from scientific journals. Government health organizations and UNICEF are other good sources to find scientifically sound information about breastfeeding.


The Lancet offers a series of peer-reviewed articles on breastfeeding.The US National Library of Medicine has many free articles from scientific journals regarding the benefits of breastfeeding.The American Academy of Pediatricians offers a host of resources regarding healthy breastfeeding practices.The Center for Disease Control offers information about recent research in breastfeeding., When teaching others, you should inform them that breast milk is the best food and drink for an infant for the first six months of life. No other food or drink is usually needed during this period, not even water.There are many reasons for this, including:


Breastfeeding helps protect babies and young children against dangerous illnesses. It passes on the mother’s immunities to the baby.Babies who are breastfed are less likely pass away because of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).Breastfeeding can improve eye and brain development in infants.Babies who are breastfed have lower lifelong risks of diabetes, obesity, and allergies., Many women might be concerned about how breastfeeding will impact their health. They might think that breastfeeding will decrease their sex drive or hurt their breasts.When educating them, you can let them know that this is not the case. In fact there are many benefits for mothers who breastfeed. These include:


Reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes
Reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancerRelease of oxytocin into the mother’s body, improving her mood and mental healthIncreased metabolism, When other people ask you about breastfeeding, you can refer them to good sources of information about breastfeeding. These include websites, pamphlets, books, charts, and videos.


You can post links over social media to help spread awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding.
You can share a helpful book or website with a pregnant friend who might be interested in breastfeeding.

, You might feel passionately about the benefits of breastfeeding, but understand that other women choose not to breastfeed for a variety of reasons, including medical reasons. While it is true that the majority of women are able to breastfeed, you never know what situation a mother is in.


If a woman is infected with HIV, there is a risk that she can pass the infection to her infant through breastfeeding.Insufficient glandular tissue, breast cancer, thyroid imbalances, or galactosemia might cause a woman to be unable to produce milk."

Wash your hands.,
Put a cloth moistened with warm water over your breast for 2 minutes.,
Give your breasts a massage.,
Sit up and lean forward.,
Position your fingers over the milk reservoirs on your breast.,
Apply pressure inward toward your chest wall.,
Express breast milk.,
Collect the expressed breast milk in a container.,
Repeat the process on the other breast.",How to Hand Express Breast Milk," Your hands should be washed before you attempt to hand express breast milk. If you washed your hands with cold water, let them warm up before touching your breasts. Cold hands can cause the process to take longer than warm hands. If it's your first time and you're feeling uncertain, you can also ask for help from a nurse, or even get some help from your partner.;
, This can help with the expression of milk. Though it's not necessary, it certainly won't hurt the process.

, If you want to prime your breasts for hand expression further, you can give your breasts a gentle massage using your hands or a soft towel. Just gently knead and massage the skin around both nipples to help your breasts relax and get ready to produce milk.

, This position will make it easier for you to express your milk and to stay comfortable during the process. You won't express as much milk if you're standing or lying down.

, You should position your hands in a ""C"" above or below your nipple. Here's what you should do:


Put your thumb above your nipple. It should rest approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) above your nipple.
Place the first 2 fingers of your hand 1 inch (2.54 cm) below your nipple directly in line with your thumb.
Adjust your finger placement for comfort and your breast size.
Refrain from cupping your breast in this position.

, The pressure should be gentle and firm, but should not feel like you are squeezing the breast at all. Avoid tightening or stretching your skin over the areola, because this will make it more difficult to express the milk. Press your thumb and index finger directly back into the breast tissue, into the wall of the chest. Here are some other things to keep in mind:


Remember to press back, not out, and to roll your fingers, not slide them.
Roll your thumb and fingers forward so that you squeeze the milk out of the milk sinuses, which are found under the areola, under the nipple.
Keep fingers together. Spreading your fingers out reduces the effectiveness of the process.
Lift larger breasts before applying pressure.

, Use a rolling motion away from your body with your thumb and fingers. Compress your breast with this rolling motion. As the saying goes, you should press, compress, and then relax. Once you get used to it, you should be able to fall into a rhythm, as if the baby were nursing, which will help you express your breast milk more easily.


Every woman's breasts are different. It's up to you to find the best position that helps you express the most milk.
You can also experiment with expressing your breast milk, massaging, expressing your milk, and massaging again.

, If you're expressing just to make your breasts feel more comfortable, you can express the milk into a towel or just express it over a sink. Here are some things that you can do if you do want to save the milk for later use:


Utilize milk bags to collect the expressed milk.
Express the milk directly into bottles for later use.
Use a funnel to direct the breast milk into your chosen container, if necessary.
Use a container with a wider mouth, such as a coffee cup or a small jar. Once the cup is filled, transfer the milk into a storage container.

, Change positions slightly on each breast to completely express all milk. Moving back and forth between the breasts will stimulate even more expression of milk.

Use your milk to soothe cracked nipples.,
Wash your nipples after breastfeeding.,
Use ointment.,
Apply a cold compress or hydrogel dressing over the nipples.,
Use nipple shields with the guidance of a lactation educator.,
Try salt water rinse.,
Recognize other causes for sore nipples.,
Know when to seek medical help.",How to Heal a Cracked Nipple when Breastfeeding1," One of the easiest remedies to soothe your cracked nipples is applying your own milk to the tender skin. Your own milk is sterile and the most natural liquid to apply over the skin that will not adversely impact your baby.Manually express a little milk and let it air dry on your nipple.
Besides providing a natural way to soothe the skin, the human breast milk is also thought to carry antibacterial healing properties.However, you should not let your skin bathe in the breast milk for extended period of time if you have thrush. Yeast can thrive in the milk if allowed to do so and this can worsen the infection.;
, Make sure to clean your nipples with water and a gentle soap after breastfeeding to wash off your baby's saliva and dried milk.


Rinsing off your nipples after each feeding will decrease a risk of infection, which can lead to cracked and sore skin.Use only unscented, gentle soap to wash the skin to reduce irritation. Be sure to rinse off the soap entirely as leaving a residue can irritate the skin and worsen the problem.After washing your nipples, gently pat them dry with a soft cloth and allow them to air dry. This can help reduce soreness and prevent irritation caused your bra or a shirt.You can also keep your irritated nipples from coming into contact with a constricting bra by putting them into doughnut-shaped nipple shells., You may want to check out over-the-counter ointments to help soothe cracked nipples. Make sure you evaluate their ingredients, as they should be all natural and contain no chemicals that are unsuitable for your baby.


Choose antibacterial ointment to soothe and treat skin that is infected. Your lactation specialist or doctor may also recommend a prescription strength ointment.Olive oil or medical-grade lanolin ointments can also help promote healing of your cracked nipple and keep it from forming a scab. Because the ingredients are all natural, you do not need to worry about washing it off between feedings.A moisture barrier may also help speed the healing of your sore nipple, as research has shown that keeping a cracked nipple naturally moist and slowing natural evaporation promotes healing., You can use a cold compress or a moist dressing to treat your cracked skin. Both techniques can help relieve irritation, pain, and inflammation.


Hydrogel pads can be applied to your nipples between feedings to keep them from drying out. Make sure that you do not touch your nipple tissue directly with your fingers, as you could possibly transfer bacteria to it.Avoid using hydrogel pads if you already have a fungal or bacterial infection on your nipple, as enclosing your nipple in a moist environment can worsen the infection.You can make a cold compress using ice or purchase an ice pack from the drugstore. A cold compress helps soothe your nipples and can decrease inflammation., Some practitioners may recommend using nipple shields, which are silicone shields placed over your nipples during breastfeeding. Be aware that these devices can do more harm than good if used improperly, including increasing your baby’s difficulty to latch.Get help from your doctor or lactation educator so you know how to use them correctly.


Ineffective latching and breastfeeding due to the nipple shields can cause your nipples to be pinched, creating a larger injury., A saline solution that is about as salty as tears can be prepared at home to clean and disinfect cracked nipples.


Mix ½ tsp of table salt in a cup of sterile water. Bathe your nipples for no longer than 5 minutes in the solution.Rinse your nipples in sterile water to remove the salty taste before nursing your baby., Sore nipples are almost unavoidable in the first few weeks after delivery, as your baby's mouth is very small. Poor latching and positioning are typically the main causes of sore and cracked nipples during nursing. However, there are other causes of sore nipples you should be aware of.


Your baby may get a yeast infection in her mouth or throat, known as thrush, and pass this onto you during nursing. Symptoms of thrush include painful, and sometimes cracked nipples, as well as redness and itchiness of the breast. If you suspect thrush, seek medical treatment for both you and your baby.Mastitis, a bacterial infection of the milk ducts, can cause your nipples to become cracked and your ducts to become too inflamed to let milk down effectively. This infection can also result in a fever, chills and body aches with more serious complications.You may suffer from nipple discomfort due to Raynaud’s syndrome, which causes your nipple to become blue or white after a feeding session and you experience pain as blood flows back to your nipple., If nipple soreness persists after the first week of nursing or if you think your nipples might be infected, seek help from a lactation consultant or doctor. You might have another underlying problem in addition to a poor latch from your baby.If you experience any symptoms of infection, including bleeding or oozing nipples, tenderness around the areola, pain during or after nursing, fever and chills, talk to your doctor."

Take domperidone (Motilium), if it’s available.,
Try metoclopramide to boost milk supply, if approved by your doctor.,
Limit the prolactin-decreasing drugs you take.,
Use hormone therapy to mimic pregnancy.",How to Increase Prolactin2," Domperidone can be taken under the supervision of your doctor, and may help boost milk supply by increasing prolactin levels.Domperidone is not available in all countries.Discuss all medication usage with your doctor, and only use it as directed.


Do not take domperidone if you have a history of heart problems.
Domperidone is generally considered safer for breastfeeding mothers than metoclopramide, and is in the “safest” category to take while breastfeeding., Metoclopramide (Reglan, Maxolon) indirectly increases your prolactin. It requires a prescription, so visit your doctor to discuss whether this medication is safe for you to take.Do not take metoclopramide if you have a history of depression. Regardless of your mental health history, watch for signs of depression like low mood, crying a lot, lack of interest in things, and feeling suicidal.

, Some medications decrease prolactin as a side effect. Never stop taking your medications without talking to your doctor first, but if you’re taking any of the following then discuss your concerns with your doctor. Ask whether you can use an alternate medication to the following:Dopamine
Amphetamine (used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy)
Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta)
GABA
Histamine H2 receptor antagonists (Ranitidine, Cimetidine, etc.)
Cholinergic agonists (atropine, tiotropium bromide, tropicamide, and more)

, If you need to increase your prolactin but you can’t or don’t want to get pregnant, you may be able to work closely with your doctor to “trick” your body into thinking you’re pregnant. This involves taking estrogen and progesterone in certain amounts and at certain times, possibly for over 6 months."

Wait for an appropriate time.,
Explain why you breastfeed.,
Answer questions.,
Talk about the myths of breastfeeding.,
Defend your right to breastfeed.",How to Educate Others on the Importance of Breastfeeding2," It is crucial that you do not start the discussion too early or late, especially with expectant mothers. Expectant mothers should be in their third trimester before you start this conversation.


If you try to start the conversation right after a woman announces she's pregnant, you risk sounding insensitive. Consider the mother's needs during pregnancy, and wait until she is farther along.
If you wait too long after the baby's birth, you risk missing a vital window for the baby to start breastfeeding. Women should start breastfeeding their baby within an hour of birth.If you are seeking to educate people other than mothers, wait until the topic comes up naturally in conversation. Perhaps you are discussing another friend's baby, or maybe you read an interesting article on the matter.

, If you are a breastfeeding mother, you may start the conversation by sharing your personal reasons for breastfeeding. Perhaps you breastfeed to improve your baby’s health or maybe you do it to increase your bond with your baby. Either way, let others know why. You can say:


“For me, it is important to give my baby the best start in life that I can.""
""Breastfeeding can reduce my baby's risk of disease and infection. Babies are so vulnerable, so it is very important for me to protect mine any way that I can.""
“I felt as though there was an important social bond developing between me and my baby. Breastfeeding really helped us grow together.”

, Some people might be confused or put off by breastfeeding. If they have questions, do your best to answer them in a confident but non-judgmental way. Do not feel defensive. They are just curious, and by answering their questions, you can help teach others.For example, if they ask “Why are you breastfeeding instead of using formula?” you might say, “Breastfeeding will help protect my baby against sickness. It has been shown that babies who are breastfed have fewer allergies, infections, and skin diseases, and they are healthier over the course of their life.”, Some people might have certain notions about breastfeeding. Perhaps they think it is inconvenient, or maybe they worry that it prevents women from returning to work. Explain in a gentle tone how breastfeeding can be part of their life and schedule.


You can say, “Breastfeeding does not require you to wash bottles. You won’t have to pack formula before you leave the house. It’s really convenient!”Let working mothers know that breastfeeding is possible while they work. You can tell them, “You can always pump your milk and save it for when you are not around your baby. Breast milk can be refrigerated for up to eight days. You can even freeze your breast milk!”You might want to inform people of how breastfeeding might save them money. You can say, ""Did you know that you can save up to $1000 a year by breastfeeding instead of giving your baby formula?""If a woman has reasons for not breastfeeding, do not try to convince her to do it. While breastfeeding might be right for some women, you should not lecture someone who is unable to do it.

, If someone makes a comment about you breastfeeding in public, stand up for yourself. You can use this opportunity to teach them about the importance of breastfeeding.


If someone asks you to stop breastfeeding in public, you can say, ""I am just feeding my baby. It is important that they receive proper nutrients, and this the most natural way for me to provide that to them.""
If someone asks you to go to go to the bathroom, you can say, ""A bathroom is not a sanitary place to feed a baby. Would you eat in the bathroom?""In many English speaking countries, including the US, UK, Australia, and Canada, it is legal to breastfeed in public.If someone challenges you, you can say, ""What I am doing is perfectly legal, and I have every right to stay here.""

Report violations in the workplace.,
Breastfeed in public.,
Sign up to be a breastfeeding counselor.,
Join a breastfeeding support group.",How to Educate Others on the Importance of Breastfeeding3," Most places have regulations protecting the mother’s right to pump milk while at work. Understand your local laws. If your employers refuses you a sanitary place to pump your milk, report the violation to your department of labor. This will encourage other employers to provide women the proper facilities to pump.


In the US, employers are required to provide a sanitary pumping room for mothers. This does not include a bathroom. Lactation rooms must be a private room with an outlet. Employers must allow mothers breaks to pump their milk.In the UK, you should provide written notification to your employer before you return to work that you intend to breastfed. While your employer is not legally obligated to provide you a separate space for pumping, they do have to allow you to rest and take breaks.In Australia, it is against the law to discriminate against breastfeeding mothers. While laws vary from state to state, you may be able to prove discrimination if your employer does not provide a sanitary space or adequate breaks for breastfeeding.In Canada, employers must accommodate breastfeeding mothers by providing a private space for pumping milk, adequate breaks, and alternative work arrangements., The best way to spread awareness of breastfeeding is to show others that breastfeeding is a normal, natural thing. You can do this by breastfeeding in public. While some might judge you for this, it perfectly legal in most English-speaking countries. The more you do it, the more normal and accepted it will become.More and more stores are offering sanitary areas for breastfeeding. You can ask a store if they have a nursing area for mothers.
If you are out at the park or playground, you can breastfeed your baby there. It is not illegal for a woman to breastfeed in open, public places.
In general, employees do not have the right to forbid you to breastfeed in stores.You should double-check your local laws to see if you are able to breastfeed in a private establishment, such as a store or restaurant.

, Breastfeeding USA offers accreditation to mothers who want to become consultants to other mothers. They may offer one-on-one lactation sessions or hold group support meetings. To apply, you must be a member of the organization and have breastfed for at least one year., If you are struggling with breastfeeding or if you want to connect with other likeminded supporters of breastfeeding, you can find a local breastfeeding group. These groups help support women with infants. They also work to educate people on maternal health and lobby the government for mother’s rights. Even if you are not a breastfeeding mother, you may want to contact these groups to see how you can help.


La Leche League International offers groups across the world. You can search their website for information on locating a group near you.Breastfeeding USA can connect Americans with local breastfeeding counselors and support groups.The Australian Breastfeeding Association offers programs across Australia to help connect mothers and advocates.Your local hospital may offer its own support groups led by a lactation consultant.

Allow your baby to self-latch.,
Position baby correctly.,
Adjust your baby without unlatching.,
Recognize early signs of hunger.,
Check if your baby has a tongue-tie.",How to Heal a Cracked Nipple when Breastfeeding2," Your baby is born with the innate instinct to feed. Barring anatomical abnormalities, you may be able to avoid painful breastfeeding by letting your baby direct the latch.Sit in a semi-reclining position and place your baby belly-down on your chest with her head close to your exposed breast.Allow your baby to orient herself to your nipple and self-latch., You can help guide your baby’s body and your own body into the most effective nursing position. This helps your baby to latch onto your nipple correctly.


Sit comfortably with your baby on your lap. Support your baby’s shoulders with your arm but do not direct her head so that they are able to self-latch.Point your nipple downward toward your baby’s nose so that she can latch properly and the nipple will be aimed for the roof of the baby’s mouth., If your nipple hurts as your baby starts to nurse, then adjust her body instead of detaching them from your breast. Detaching can cause your baby to become frustrated and to clamp down on your nipple, causing more damage.


Position your baby’s shoulders lower or higher to help adjust the angle of her head, as this may improve the latch.Try bringing your baby closer to your body so that her head dips down slightly. This allows her to bring your nipple further into the mouth and improve latch., A frustrated hungry baby is more likely to clamp down on your nipple than to latch onto it correctly. Look for feeding cues and feed your baby before she gets frustrated and over-hungry.


Soothe your fussy baby by allowing her to feed immediately when she shows signs of hunger., Your baby may be unable to latch properly due to having a tongue-tie. A small piece of skin tethers your baby’s tongue at the bottom of her mouth, which makes it impossible to move the tongue forward.


Check to see if your baby is able to extend her tongue past the bottom lip or can lift her tongue to the roof of the mouth when crying.A doctor can clip the small piece of skin tethering your baby’s tongue in order to help improve the latch. This is a simple procedure that your baby recovers from very quickly."

Wean gradually, whenever possible.,
Take a pain reliever containing ibuprofen or acetaminophen.,
Avoid nipple stimulation, as this will trigger milk production.,
Avoid pumping your milk as it signals to your body that it needs to produce more.,
Drink lots of water.,
In severe cases, talk to your doctor about estrogen injections.,
Prepare emotionally.",How to Dry Up Your Breast Milk Supply1," Start replacing one or two feedings a day, and work your way to completely stopping. This is the safest, and most painless way as your body will slowly stop producing milk.


Breasts that are not weaned gradually, but suddenly, can become painful, engorged, and even put mothers at significant risk for developing mastitis.If you have been pumping and wish to stop, here is a typical schedulethat will wean you off your pump slowly but surely:
Day 1: pump for 5 minutes every 2-3 hours
Day 2: pump for 5 minutes every 4-5 hours
Day 3-7: pump just long enough to relieve discomfort

;
, This should reduce your discomfort and some swelling.

, Wear a supportive, but not-too-tight bra. Opt for clothing that is loose and less likely to show milk spots; consider wearing nursing pads to absorb leaking milk.


Taking a warm shower, although it inevitably involves some stimulation, may help to relieve pressure in the breast and soothe discomfort. Avoid direct stimulation from the water whenever possible.

, If you start to become engorged, hand pump just enough to reduce your discomfort.

, If you become dehydrated, you will actually start producing more milk, and your discomfort will increase.

, Estrogen injections have fallen out of favor, although they were once used to promote estrogen suppression. Some forms of estrogen injections contain known carcinogens.If you have consistent trouble with lactation suppression, ask your doctor about taking medications like bromocriptine (Parlodel). Doctors usually don't recommend taking Parlodel because of increased likelihood of hypertension, stroke, and heart attack., Hormone levels will change drastically as your milk production slows, which will trigger mood swings. Many women feel guilty, inadequate and sad. Getting through these emotions may be the hardest part of the whole process, but having a good support system will help.

Add protein to your diet.,
Eat dairy.,
Stay hydrated.,
Limit caffeine intake.,
Limit alcohol consumption.,
Eat junk food sparingly.,
Take supplements.,
Do not binge diet.,
Exercise.",How to Eat While Breastfeeding," Rice, bread, pasta, and breakfast foods like granola can help keep your energy levels up. Sticking to whole grain sources of carbohydrates gives you extra fiber. This will help your digestive system.Consider making your own muesli for breakfast with bananas, chopped whole oats, granola, dates, and any other items you prefer.You burn calories when you breastfeed.For this reason, it is important to keep your energy levels high with sufficient carbohydrates.;
, Just like when you were pregnant, incorporating fruits and vegetables into your diet is a wise idea. Having five portions of fruits and vegetables daily is a good benchmark. Aim for fruits and vegetables with varying colors to maximize the nutritional benefits.Spinach, kale, and darker lettuces give you needed iron while citrus fruits like oranges or grapefruit provide Vitamin C.Make sure to wash all fruits and vegetables to remove any pesticides that might be on them. Organic vegetables and fruits should have fewer chemicals. The following amounts represent one portion:Half a grapefruit
One apple, one banana, or one orange
Half an avocado
Half a green pepper
One full tablespoon of dried fruit
Fistful of berries or grapes
Two apricots
Two plums
One slice of pineapple
Three full tablespoons of cooked vegetables or beans
150 mL (5 oz.) glass of freshly squeezed orange juice

, Protein is very important for your muscular strength and overall health. Seek protein through meat (preferably lean), eggs, and legumes (kidney beans, pinto beans, lentils). Also consider having two servings of fish per week. “Oily” types of fish like salmon are particularly good.Eat fish that are low in mercury.Salmon, trout, shrimp, tilapia, anchovies, perch, oysters, and crab are good options. Avoid grouper, sea bass, mackerel, marlin, shark, and tuna.Oily fish contain omega-3 fatty acids, which are thought to vital to your baby's brain and eye development. If you don't eat fish, consider taking an omega-3 supplement.
Vegetarian mothers run the risk of having a B12 deficiency. Their babies also can have this deficiency, which causes decreased appetite, vomiting, muscular atrophy, and other problems. Talk to your doctor about taking a supplement. Also, you can get B12 through fermented soybean products., Although cow milk can cause problems for some babies, having a small amount of low-fat dairy products like yogurt is healthy. Goat milk products also can be a healthy alternative to cow’s milk. If you remove cow’s milk from your diet, your doctor might advise you to take calcium and/or Vitamin D supplements.If your child has an adverse reaction to cow’s milk (ingested through your breast milk), your baby might display these symptoms:Bloating
Rash
Eczema
Changes in excrement
Insufficient growth
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Itchy skin
Swollen face, lips, eyes
Coughing
Constipation

, Although you do not need to drink excess water while breastfeeding, aim to have at least eight 8-oz glasses (about 2 liters) of water or other fluids (apart from alcohol) during the day. While breastfeeding, your body releases the cuddling hormone oxytocin, which causes you to be thirsty.Keep water handy while breastfeeding.Make sure that your urine is pale. If it is dark yellow or smells strange, you should drink more water.Check the chemical levels in your water. Although some tap water is healthy to consume, in other cities it is not. In the U.S., your water supplier must provide you with a copy of a Consumer Confidence Report, which shows what chemicals exist in the water.Consider buying a filter for your water. This can give you peace of mind that your water is safer and often improves taste as well.

, Try to keep your caffeine intake under 200 mg per day. This equates one mug (5 oz) of filter coffee, two mugs (10 oz) of instant coffee, or two mugs (10 oz) of tea. Excess caffeine should not hurt your baby but could cause sleeplessness.Non-caffeinated herbal teas like peppermint, camomile, or fennel can be delicious alternatives. You should not drink these too often, though.Remember that caffeine is also present in other food and drink, like sodas and chocolate.

, Although you now can enjoy a drink now and then, try to drink alcohol only once or twice weekly. Generally, aim for no more than one glass (5 oz.) of wine, one 12 ounce beer, or one shot of liquor per drinking session.More than this amount can harm your child.Your baby ingests alcohol through your breast milk so it is best to feed your baby before drinking rather than directly afterwards. Newborn babies also need feeding more frequently so it could be best to abstain from alcohol for the first six weeks postpartum.

, Although it is okay to eat a candy bar or a bag of potato chips every now and then, keep those foods for special treats. Your body needs to heal and healthy foods can help make that happen. Similarly, your baby benefits from the food you eat. Strive to make healthy choices accordingly.


Although you should limit junk food, you should not limit all foods with fats. Your body needs some fats. Eat dairy products, almonds, or salmon for sources of healthy fats.

, Breastfeeding mothers should take a Vitamin D supplement containing 600 IU of Vitamin D.If your prenatal vitamin already contains Vitamin D at this level, you can continue taking that supplement. In this case, you do not need extra Vitamin D.Continue to take a multivitamin while breastfeeding.
You may be advised to take calcium supplements as well. The recommended amount is 1,000 milligrams (mg) per day.

, Although you might feel pressure to lose your pregnancy weight, it is unwise to drop pounds too quickly while breastfeeding. In fact, depending on your weight gain during pregnancy, you might need to add 400 – 500 calories/day while breastfeeding.Ask your doctor to be sure. Breastfeeding burns calories and can burn fat that your body stored during pregnancy. A weight loss of 2 lbs. (approximately 1 kg) per week while breastfeeding is healthy.Calorie needs are typically between 2,200 and 2,800 kcal per day, but this depends on your weight and physical activity.
dieting can reduce breastmilk volume and effect your ability to nurse your growing baby.
Waiting until your six week postpartum check-up to lose any weight is advisable. You will need all your energy for your baby in those first weeks., While breastfeeding, it is important to stay fit and active as well. Although strenuous exercise like marathon training is not right yet, doing pelvic floor exercises can help your body heal. These exercises tone your vagina.See Do Pelvic Floor Exercises for specific instructions.
Avoid swimming until you have not had vaginal bleeding or discharge for one week."

Drink sage tea.,
Apply cold compresses or cabbage to your breasts.,
Take vitamin B6.",How to Dry Up Your Breast Milk Supply2," Sage contains a natural estrogen that is reputed to dry up your milk supply. You can find sage in one of two forms:


As a tea: buy sage tea at your local specialty health store, and brew it along with some milk and honey.
As a tincture: buy a sage tincture, which is mixed with a little bit of alcohol, at a health food store. This tincture is reputed to be a bit more efficient than sage tea at drying up your milk supply.

, Cabbage leaves work great as they are cool, and there is a component to them that naturally dries up your milk. Apply them to your entire breast and replace them when they wilt.

, Vitamin B6 is reputed to stop the body's production of plasma prolactin, which is what causes mothers to produce breast milk. Several studies, however, found no statistically relevant data to suggest that vitamin B6 actually helped women suppress lactation."

It may feel hot, uncomfortable, or painful.

, If you have a clogged milk duct, your breast may hurt when you nurse your baby on that side, especially at first, as your milk lets down. You may notice that the pain decreases or even disappears immediately after nursing., Many women do not experience a fever with a plugged milk duct, but some do. In addition, a fever can be a sign that infection is present or that you are developing mastitis. If you develop a fever or feel like you have the flu, call your doctor., The primary cause of plugged milk ducts is that your breasts are not getting drained regularly and completely.This can happen for a number of reasons, including feeding problems. If your baby isn’t latching correctly, isn’t breastfeeding frequently enough, or isn’t draining your breasts, you may develop clogs.


There’s no reason to worry unnecessarily about one clogged milk duct, but it may be a good idea to follow up with a lactation specialist or your baby’s pediatrician, just to ensure that your baby is healthy, thriving, and feeding correctly.

, If you pump your milk, make sure that you are using one powerful enough to drain your breasts completely. Otherwise, milk sits in the ducts, potentially causing clogs.


You should invest in a high quality pump. You should get a hospital grade double electric pump. Many insurance plans will cover pumps like this. Consult your health insurance to see if you can get one for a reduced price.

, If you are wearing a nursing bra that fits incorrectly and compresses your chest, you may be trapping milk inside your ducts, which can lead to clogs.

, When you are sick, your routine is disrupted. You may sleep more, and you may not pump as frequently or feed your baby as often. Plugged milk ducts sometimes result from this changes.


Similarly, if your baby is sick he or she will likely have a diminished appetite. When your baby feeds less (even for just a small period of a few days) it can leave too much milk in your breasts leading to clogged ducts., If you stop breastfeeding altogether (as opposed to tapering off gradually), you risk developing clogs.


If you do, for whatever reason, decide to stop breastfeeding suddenly, you can pump milk from your breasts in the days that follow (in gradually diminishing amounts) in order to allow your breasts to naturally taper their milk production., You may feel pain or discomfort when you nurse from the breast with the clogged duct, but continuing to do so is the best solution to the problem. Try to empty the affected breast completely, which will likely ease your symptoms., If you can, start breastfeeding with the affected breast. This helps ensure that the breast will be emptied completely. In addition, babies tend to suck strongest at first, when they are hungriest. The force your baby exerts when sucking may help dislodge the clog., By positioning your baby at your breast in different ways, you help ensure that all the milk ducts get drained.Some experts recommend, in particular, positioning your baby so that his or her chin is pointed to the sore spot. You may have to lie down or a different hold than usual to accomplish this task, but it may help dislodge the clog., If your baby is not emptying your breast, use a breast pump to express the remaining milk. Expressing the milk by hand will also work. The key is to drain your breast completely., This may help unclog your ducts and push the milk through.

, Heat can help open your ducts to let milk through. Try placing warm, moist compresses on your breast for a few minutes before you nurse your baby.Alternatively, you can take a warm bath or shower.
You can also fill up a large bowl with warm water and soak the affected breast in it. When the water starts to become milky, use gentle massage to help unclog the duct.

, Either is fine. Experiment to see which helps you the most.

, You can minimize your discomfort by taking the recommended dose every four hours.

, Unless you are purposely weaning, the best way to avoid clogged milk ducts is not to let milk accumulate in your breast for too long. Feed your baby frequently.

, If you miss any feedings or if your baby is not emptying your breasts completely, pump the excess milk, either by hand or with a breast pump.

, Underwire may compress your milk ducts, as will a poorly-fitted nursing bra. Shop around for a comfortable style that works for you.

, Lying on your stomach for extended periods of time can also compress your milk ducts.

, Some studies suggest that lecithin – either a tablespoon of the oral granular kind or a 1200 milligram capsule, three or four times a day – may help prevent plugged milk ducts.

Have a rehearsal.,
Plan and schedule your days while at work.,
Make compromises.,
Stay relaxed.,
Keep things in perspective.",How to Continue Breastfeeding After Returning to Work," Before returning to work, you need to plan ahead and prepare early. This means building up a stockpile of expressed breast milk (EBM) and establishing the infrastructure for successfully expressing breast milk at work. If you invest the time and effort to get this done first, it will be less challenging once you are back at work. Build up a stockpile of EBM while still on maternity leave. This is achieved by expressing extra~milk in between feeds and freezing them for later use. The stockpile serves the purpose of providing you with a buffer that will help minimize the stress from adjustments in the early weeks when you return to work.;
, EBM’s can be kept for up to 3 months in a freezer. Assuming that you are in a job that does not require you to travel, a small stockpile of 3 to 4 days of day feeds (about 4 to 5 bottles a day) should be a good buffer for a 3 month old baby. If you have a job that requires you to travel away from home, then you will need a larger stockpile and~more advance planning and preparations. It is important to rotate your frozen milk, so none of it goes to waste. Send some each week or each day with your baby, and freeze some each week to replace it.

, You should be able to start expressing breast milk for storage once your supply is well established around the 2nd to 3rd week after giving birth, if you have been exclusively breastfeeding all the time. The best time to express is in the morning, in between feeds, approximately 1 to 1.5 hours after a feed. Start by initially expressing a third to half of a feed (so that when the baby wakes, you will still have sufficient milk to satisfy) at a time 2 to 3 times a day. Combine these at the end of the day into a full bottle that you can then freeze for later. Doing so, you will be able to put aside one bottle every day whilst you are still on leave. In terms of volume, you will have to gauge based on your baby's appetite. A rough gauge for a 3 month old baby would be between 120 to 160 ml per feed., Once breastfeeding is well established, you will need to start getting your baby used to bottle feeding as well. Always have someone else other than yourself feed a bottle of your EBM to avoid confusing the little one. It helps if the person is an experienced care giver. Doing this earlier rather than waiting until you are about to return to work also helps. A good time to start is around 3 weeks old. When the baby is being fed by bottle, express your milk for storage. Once the baby is used to getting both a bottle feed as well as feeding direct from the breast, you should maintain this familiarity by having the baby bottle fed two or three times a week (and again, express your milk for storage when this is happening).

, It is important to train the care giver on how to give EBM and establish a system that both can agree on. For example, if you are using milk bags to store your EBM, you will need to explain to the care giver how to manage the milk bags and also the amount of time needed to get the milk to the right temperature. It can be very tiring working a full day, expressing on the side, and then coming home to breastfeed the baby directly, so it is important for your family to be supportive.

, Getting your supervisor's support is very important as you will need to excuse yourself 2 to 3 times a day for between 20 to 30 minutes to express your breast milk. It is important to assure him or her that this will not affect your work quality and delivery as well. If you know of other mothers who have or are currently expressing milk at work, connect with them as they will be a valuable support network for advice and resources. Find out in advance if there is a lactation room available at your office location and if so, what equipment might already be provided for. If there isn't a lactation room, consider requesting this early in your maternity leave. If that is not possible, you will need to find a discrete and private room that is available. This may be a meeting room with a lockable door that you could book in advance.

, Here is a list of important equipment that you will need:


Breast Pump: There are many types and brands in the market. The most suitable will be an electric double breast pump, as this will half the amount of time you need to express breast milk. An electric pump, and a hands free pumping strap or band, also means you will not end up with aching arms and hands at the end of everyday and you would still have your hands free during pumping to read a report if you are pressed for time at work or have a drink or take a bite. If you can, find one that can operate both on electricity and batteries so that you have maximum flexibility at work.
Tupperware: Depending on your breast pump, you may require Tupperware to store the funnels and keep them sterile. Some pumps have covers that are designed to keep them sterile, so Tupperware will not be required. Tupperware is handy for transporting the pump to work after you have sterilized it at home.
Bottles: Although there are milk bags available on the market, bottles are the most reliable way to transport EBM. The last thing you would want to find when you get home is that the bags have burst or leaked and you have wasted your time expressing milk. If you store EBM in milk bags, transport the EBM back home in bottles and then transfer them to milk bags at home.
Cooler bag: A small cooler bag with ice packs will keep the milk cool on the way home. You can get these from shops that sell camping gear instead of paying a premium for special equipment from the manufacturers of the pumps. If you do not have a fridge at work to store EBM during the day, you may wish to consider either buying a small bar fridge or electric cooler. Another alternative that recently became available is ""Fridge to Go"" which is a cooler bag with embedded ice packs that promises to cool liquids down and keep them cool for up to 12 hours.
Sterilizer: A sterilizer will be needed if you are going to pump more than once in your workday. If the lactation room in your office does not have one, you may wish to buy a small sterilizer. There are some small sterilizers that can hold 2 normal bottles. An alternative is to use sterilizing tablets and have a container at the office to hold the liquid. The advantage to this is that you do not have to wait for sterilizing cycles and you can keep all your equipment sterile throughout the day by leaving them submerged in the liquid. Another alternative is to buy extra funnels and parts, sterilize all of them in the morning and keep them in a Tupperware till you are ready to use them. Microwave sterilizing bags are also another alternative, readily available at baby stores.
Breast Pads: Breast pads are absolutely necessary to help you avoid accidents and unsightly milk stains at work. If you are concerned about the environment and do not want to use disposable breast pads, consider buying washable ones.

, It may be useful to have a ""rehearsal day"" a few weeks before returning to work. About 2-3 weeks before you are due to return to work, you may wish to go to work for a full day. This will help the baby and care giver to get used to a full day of bottle feeding and for you to get used to working and balancing the time required to express milk. This is especially helpful if it is your first time doing so. The experience will help you to test your system and check your equipment. If you have any problems or questions, you will then still have some time to address these before you are back to work full time. You may also consider taking a day off every week when you first come back to work. The best day to do this is on Wednesdays. If you have returned to work after just 3 months of maternity leave, your baby may not yet sleep through the night and this will provide you with a welcome break after 2 nights of disrupted sleep. Taking the middle of the week off will allow you time to recuperate and rest and regain your milk supply if it was disrupted by the stress at work. Do not plan errands or chores for the day itself, focus only on resting and feeding the baby direct from the breast.

, Block off time in your calendar in between meetings explicitly to express your milk. If you do not do so, you may get caught up with work and won’t be able to find the right time to excuse yourself when required.

, You may have to be prepared for some trade-offs so that expressing at the job does not affect your work. Instead of lunching with colleagues, you may have to multi-task by having lunch while expressing. Be clear on what you want up-front and what you are willing to trade-off so that it does not become a point of stress for you.

, Be aware that stress at work will affect your supply of milk. It is important to take it easy and not get overwhelmed by work. It is also important to drink plenty of fluids and eat well (something you may tend to overlook when you get really busy), so have a jug of water and some snacks within easy reach to keep you energized and your milk production up. If your milk supply does get disrupted due to work schedules and stress, your stockpile at home as well as your day off will be useful buffers to help you establish your rhythm.

, To sustain this over many months, you need to be relaxed and enjoy this and not see it as an obligation or commitment. If maintaining breastfeeding when you return to work adds a lot of pressure to you and sends your stress levels through the roof, continuing to do so will lead to you becoming a cranky and guilt-laden mother. If maintaining your breast milk supply at work interferes with your enjoyment of motherhood and your bonding with your child, do consider seriously if you should stop. If you take it one day at a time, the task will seem less daunting and eventually you will meet your goal. There are many ways to be a great mother and they all begin with a happy and relaxed one!

Sterilize the pump parts once per week.",How to Clean a Medela Pump," It's important that you wash, rinse and sterilize the newly bought pump first before using it. Before washing, separate all the pump parts, including the connectors, valves, and membranes.;
, Clean all parts of the pump after each use. Hot water is better for cleaning as it softens any residue or hard to remove dirt that may be in the pump, making it easier to remove.


Cleaning with hot water is also effective in germ reduction as it kills bacteria and microorganisms.

, Some of these include: bottlebrushes, chemicals, or antibacterial soaps, as these may scratch, crack, or break the pump parts.


If you really want to use a brush, make sure that you use a soft one in order to avoid damage. If any part of the pup becomes damaged, you will need to replace it.
Use mild soap when cleaning your breast pump. The Quick Clean Breastmilk Removal Soap by Medela is highly recommended when using a Medela pump.
You can also browse the Medela site for more specific instructions in cleaning your breast pump.

, Rinse each part of the pump in clean, running water after washing, then you can either let them air dry in the dish rack or put them on a clean dish towel.


Do not use a cloth towel to dry your pump. Towels may carry bacteria which can be harmful for you and your baby.

, If and when you are unable to wash the breast pump immediately, rinse it thoroughly with hot water for 10-15 seconds.This is necessary to prevent the milk residue from drying up inside the pump, which could lead to bacteria growth.


You can also use disposable hygienic wipes to wipe off the milk residue and to temporarily clean the pump. These wipes are safe to use for the pump and its parts. Medela has Quick Clean Breastpump and Accessory Wipes, which can be used after each pump session.
You can use these methods to clean off the breast pump when you are out of the house, but make sure to clean it thoroughly as soon as you get home.

, Detach the tube from the motor then wash with hot water and soap after each use. Make sure that the tubing is dry before attaching it back to the pump.


If there is still water in the pump, you can turn on the pump to completely dry the tube. Sometimes, milk gets stuck in the tubing.
When this happens, pour 3cc of vinegar through the tube, then rinse the tube out with water, before letting it air dry.

, You can remove the faceplate by snapping it off using the thumb tab. Just like the other parts, you'll have to wash it with soapy water then rinse and dry.


The diaphragm can be cleaned too. Just wipe it with clean damp cloth without using any soap. If you are unsure where the diaphragm is located, check the owner’s manual.

, Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before using the breast pump to prevent the spread of germs.


Hand washing is an effective way to prevent the spread of infections to you and your baby. You should also avoid touching the inside parts of the pump that come in contact to the milk.
Before using the pump, clean the breast and surrounding area using the Quick Clean Breastpump and Accessory Wipes or a damp cloth. Make sure that you do not use alcohol to clean the breast, as this can cause dryness which can lead to cracked nipples.

, The manual will tell you in greater detail which parts of the pump can be washed and which cannot. It will also show you how parts can be removed from the pump without damaging it.

, Place a large pot of water on the stove and bring it to the boil. When the water starts to boil immerse all the pump parts one by one. Make sure the water covers them all.


Boil the parts for 10 minutes, and no longer. After 10 minutes pick the pump parts out of the pot using a pair of tongs.
Lay the pump pieces on a clean towel to allow them to cool down and dry. Once dry, wash your hands with antibacterial soap, then reassemble the pump.
If you have hard water in your area, you can add a teaspoon of citric acid to the water, as this helps to avoid limescale build-up.

, Instead of boiling the pump parts to sterilize them, you can also use a special microwave sterilizer bag. Medela produces ""Quick Clean Micro Steam Bags"", which you can find a Target or Babies R Us.


To use, place the individual pump pieces into the bag, then pour 60 ml of water into the bag before sealing it tightly.
Determine the microwave time. This varies depending on the wattage of your microwave. You can refer to the instructions written at the back of the bag for specific instructions. Put the bag in the microwave and set it for the recommended heating time.
Once done, carefully remove the bag, open it and pour the water out of it. Wait a couple of minutes for the parts to cool down before removing them and setting them on a clean towel to dry.

, Another option for sterilizing the pump parts is to use a microwave sterilizer, which is normally used for sterilizing bottles.


Remove the rack from the sterilizer and put some water into the base. The amount of water depends on the size of the microwave sterilizer. Then, put the rack back in.
Place the pump (breastshield screwed to the connector) into the slots. Put the nipples and then the screw ring above them. Position the bottle upside down in the provided bottle cavities. Place the cap right into the side of the stem of the sterilizer. Place any other pump pieces around the rack.
Replace the lid of the sterilizer and lock the clips on the side. Put the sterilizer into the microwave. Refer to the sterilizer's instructions regarding the temperature and heating time.

, Although you only need to sterilize the pump parts once a week, you have to wash and clean the pump every after use.

Start by removing one feeding.,
Reduce the length of feedings.,
Replace breast milk with formula.,
Wait to give cow's milk.",How to Gradually Stop Breastfeeding1," When you're ready to begin weaning your child, start by dropping one breastfeeding session a day. Which one you choose is up to you. For example, you may find that feeding at night soothes your baby, so you might want to keep that one and drop a different feeding.A midday feeding is often easiest to drop, as most babies will just have had a meal of solid food. Morning and evening sessions tend to be harder to drop at first, as they provide comfort to your baby.After a while, you should be able to take away another feeding. However, you should wait at least a week or two before taking away a second feeding.;
, Another way to start weaning is to simply have shorter sessions. Gradually stop a little earlier each time you feed your baby. The goal is to feed less overall each day.Instead of feeding for 15 minutes, try 10, for example. It can help to add a snack after breastfeeding, such as a couple of bites of baby food or an applesauce/fruit pouch., If your child isn't a year old yet, they should still be getting breast milk or formula as the main thing they drink. So if you're dropping a breast milk feeding, you need to giving your baby a bottle or a sippy cup of formula instead. Only use a cup if your baby is over 6 months.You can also offer expressed breast milk in the same way., You may be tempted to replace breast milk with cow's milk. However, before age 1, your child should be mainly drinking formula or breast milk. After your baby turns a year old, it's fine to give them cow's milk, but make the transition gradual."

Watch for cues from your baby.,
Use tricks to ease the transition to a bottle.,
Distract your baby at normal breastfeeding times.,
Don't refuse to breastfeed.,
Wait and try again in a week or two if your child isn't ready.",How to Gradually Stop Breastfeeding2," Weaning is easier when you let your baby lead the way. That is, many babies will start to become more interested in eating solid foods. Others may grow restless as they turn into toddlers. As your baby starts to lose interest, it's a good time to work on weaning.However, if your baby suddenly starts refusing your breast, particularly if you have a baby under 6 months, something else could be wrong. Your baby could be sick, for instance, or they could be teething. Your baby may also refuse breast milk because you've change your diet, shampoo, or soap, as well as if you've just started your period.
If your baby is refusing, try offering them breast milk when they're sleepy. Also, call your doctor to ask for advice., As you stop breastfeeding, you'll likely need to transition to a bottle. One way to help transition is to put a little bit of breast milk on the nipple before you give them the bottle. You can also put some breast milk in the baby's mouth. Start the baby on a bottle with breast milk when they're hungry but not so much that they are screaming and crying.If your child is a bit older (over 6 months, at least) and showing interest in cups, you may be able to transition directly from breastfeeding to a sippy cup.

, Your baby is going to need help adjusting to the new routine. Playing games, introducing new foods, and enjoying time together can be a way to distract your baby during typical breastfeeding times., If your baby is crying to be breastfed, it's best to feed them. If you say ""no,"" you may find it even harder to wean your child. Instead, try to avoid sitting in the typical places you breastfeed when you don't want to breastfeed. If you sit in your usual places, your child will expect you to breastfeed., Sometimes, your child is just not ready to be weaned. If they're sick or been through a big adjustment, breastfeeding provides comfort that they need. If your child is struggling, try again in a week or two."

Express milk as needed.,
Take over-the-counter pain medications as needed.,
Use cold compresses for engorged breasts.,
Watch for a blocked duct.",How to Gradually Stop Breastfeeding3," Often, when you're weaning, you'll have an excess amount of milk, which can make you uncomfortable. Expressing that milk can take some of the pressure off. Plus, you can use that milk to help wean your baby by putting it in a bottle or cup., If you're in pain as you try to wean, you can try some basic pain medications, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen. They can help control the pain and swelling., Some women experience engorgement while trying to wean, which can lead to swelling and discomfort. If it happens to you, place cold compresses on your breasts to help decrease the symptoms., With a blocked duct, you'll feel a hard spot in your breast that will be painful to the touch. If you suspect you have a blocked duct or even if you're not sure what you're experiencing is normal, call your doctor or a lactation consultant.Blocked ducts happen more often if you suddenly stop weaning than if you gradually stop.

Read the instruction manual.,
Rinse each part after use.,
Wash with soap and water.,
Rinse away soap with hot water.,
Let the parts air dry.,
Wipe down the outside of the pump.,
Clean tubing only if it makes contact with breast milk.",How to Clean a Breast Pump1," Each breast pump comes with an instruction manual that explains the basics for cleaning that particular model. Read your instruction manual to see what the manufacturer suggests for cleaning.Additionally, the instruction manual will explain how to remove parts for cleaning.;
, When you get finished using a part of the breast pump, make sure to rinse it. Use cool water to remove the breast milk that is left behind. This helps reduce the risk of germs and bacteria sitting in the parts.Rinsing after use helps prevent a buildup of milk residue that can contaminate milk.

, One of the easiest ways to clean the parts of a breast pump is by washing them thoroughly. Take each used part and wash them with warm water and dishwashing detergent. Make sure to rinse well afterwards.Let the parts soak in water for five minutes before washing.This will remove germs and bacteria.
Clean as soon as you can. Don’t leave dirty breast pump parts overnight.

, After washing the separate parts of the breast pump, rinse away the soap. Make sure to rinse each part for around 15 seconds with hot water. This helps cut down on germs and bacteria., After rinsing, place the parts on a clean drying rack or paper towel so they can air dry. Don’t dry the parts with a towel since they can transfer germs onto the breast pump which could contaminate the milk.Do not store parts that are wet or damp. This can cause mold to grow in the breast pump parts.

, After each use of the breast pump, wipe down the outside of the pump with a paper towel or cloth. If your pump is electric, never place it into water or use a microwave sterilizer. This could mess up the motor., Usually, there is no need to wash the tubing that comes with your breast pump. However, if for some reason the tubing has contact with breast milk, wash it with water and liquid soap. Hang it up and let it air dry completely before reattaching.If any condensation occurs in the tubing afterwards, let the pump run into the tube dries out.

Set up pillow supports.,
Arrange the babies next to you on the nursing pillow.,
Latch one baby on at a time.,
Check your babies' positions.,
Let the babies finish nursing.",How to Breastfeed Twins1," Sit on your couch, bed, or floor and place a pillow behind your back for support. Put a nursing pillow designed for twins firmly around your waist and set a pillow underneath it for extra support. You can also set single nursing pillows on both of your sides so you can set the babies there once you've finished breastfeeding them.You may want to have someone help you get used to setting up the pillow supports and handing you the babies (especially if they're newborns).
Some double nursing pillows actually strap around your waist.;
, You can place the babies in the double football or clutch hold so that one baby is on each of your sides. You should be able to tuck the babies under your arms (like a football). The babies' tummies should be touching your tummy and they shouldn't be on their backs. Their feet should be pointed towards your back and you can support the shoulders, neck, and head with your arm.This hold works well for pre-term or smaller babies. It's also a good choice if you had a C-section since it keeps pressure off of your stomach.

, Start by latching whichever baby has an easier time of latching on. Once that baby is securely on your breast, help the other baby latch on to the other breast. This will give you a chance to help the baby that might be struggling more to latch on.If you have pre-term or very young babies, you may want to place a small rolled up cloth right behind their heads. This will give them a little extra support.

, If you have a pillow underneath your nursing pillow, your babies should be raised up a little towards your breasts. For simultaneous breastfeeding, their legs should be wrapped around your sides and almost tucked around your back. The babies should be on their sides rather than their backs while they're breastfeeding.Your main goal is that they remain latched on and don't roll back or off of the nursing pillow.

, You don't need to stop and switch breasts as long as both babies are nursing well. You may need to help a baby latch on if it slips off, but give it a chance to keep nursing the same breast. This will ensure that your baby gets the rich hindmilk.You may want to alternate babies and breasts on the next feeding or the following day.

Boil the parts to sanitize.,
Use breast pump wipes.,
Place in the dishwasher.,
Microwave the parts.",How to Clean a Breast Pump2," You should sanitize all the breast pump parts once each day. To do this, place the parts into a large pot. Completely cover the parts with water. Boil the water, and let the parts stand in the boiling water for 10 minutes.After letting the water cool, remove the parts with tongs. Don’t touch with your hands.
Let the parts air dry.

, If you are going to be pumping on the go, you may want to look into buying breast pump wipes. These wipes are a convenient way to wipe away breast milk and do a quick clean if you don’t have access to water, soap, or a microwave.When you get home, make sure to clean the breast pump well.
You can order these wipes online or purchase them in baby stores.

, Some breast pumps are made so you can put the parts in the dishwasher. Check the manual that came with your breast pump to check if your model is dishwasher safe.If it is dishwasher safe, you can place the parts on the top shelf and wash with the rest of your dishes.

, You can buy microwave sterilizers to use for your breast pump parts. These sterilizers are not FDA-approved for sterilization. However, they will sanitize your breast pump parts so they will be cleaned and ready for use again.Only microwave the parts if the same person is using them. Never microwave between different users. The microwave sterilizer will not adequately sterilize the parts for multiple users.

Consider nursing your babies individually.,
Create a nursing schedule.,
Set up a breastfeeding area.,
Wear a comfortable nursing bra or clothing to breastfeed in.,
Talk with a lactation consultant.",How to Breastfeed Twins2," It may help to nurse each twin individually in the early days of breastfeeding, when you and your babies are learning about latching on and positioning. This way you'll be able to spend a little more time and have extra hands to work with one baby at a time.Nursing your babies individually can also help you learn about each baby's nursing habits. This can help you when you begin to simultaneously breastfeed them.

, Consider setting a nursing schedule for your twins so you can get them on a feeding schedule. If your babies are very small, work with a doctor or lactation consultant to make a schedule that will give your babies enough milk. For example, you may set an alarm to go off every hour and a half so you know that it's time to feed your twins.A schedule can be helpful if you're so tired that you can't remember how long it's been since their last feeding.
If you'd like to follow your babies' hunger cues and feed them whenever their hungry, just keep track of when you feed them and how long they nursed.

, Create a space where you have all the things you'll need while breastfeeding. You should have easy access to anything you'd need during the feeding so you won't have to interrupt the feeding. Ensure that you're comfortable since you'll be spending a lot of time breastfeeding. Consider having these in your breastfeeding area:Nursing pillow and support pillows
Water bottles
Healthy snacks (such as granola bars, fruit, protein bars)
Things to read
Access to entertainment (such as a tablet, television, or laptop)

, Choose a nursing bra that you can easily unsnap or unclip with one hand in order to breastfeed. If you choose not to wear a nursing bra, consider wearing a comfortable top that gives you access to your breasts so you don't have to take off your entire top to breastfeed.For extra support, look for a nursing bra that contains an underwire. If you'll be simultaneously breastfeeding, ensure that you can easily access both breasts while wearing the bra.

, If you're concerned that your babies aren't latching on correctly, are difficult to position, or aren't getting enough milk, contact a lactation consultant. The lactation consultant can watch you breastfeed and identify any problems. They'll help you so that your babies are able to easily nurse on their own. Look for a board certified lactation consultant.Find out if your hospital or birth center offers lactation consultants to work with you. You may be able to drop in to a weekly nursing session or have someone come to your home.
You can also talk to other mothers of twins. Discuss breastfeeding challenges and tricks to make it work for you.

Determine if your toddler is still getting enough nourishment with your breast milk alone.,
Determine how much the toddler weighs.,
Determine if your child can still sit adequately near or next to you, to continue to confidently feed at/on your breast.,
Make sure to provide adequate times of relaxation for your toddler and yourself, to ensure your breasts don't get too overworked, and to make sure the toddler can still get enough milk.,
Recognize that now that your toddler is well-trained in how to feed at your breasts properly, the time he/she takes at your breast will begin to diminish.,
Minimize any and all distractions that may go on around you and your toddler.,
Don't try to overwork your toddler, and ""make them solely"" drink at your breast.,
Continue to use the same procedure for breastfeeding as to what was used when your child was smaller, as compared to now.",How to Continue to Breastfeed a Toddler," If not, most toddlers need to get supplementary nutrients from other sources of milk and food, such as either a formula-based milk, or a cow's milk of some sort (whole milk is best for some smaller children, while others may necessitate the need to use two percent milk). Mother's milk may be best for most of the time while your child was an infant, but now that they've grown up a little, they may need a bit more and extra supplements of other milks may now be necessary to use.;
, While some are still able to be closely held in their mother's arms, some are growing ever so much heavier and may need a little assistance to help them suckle from their mother's breasts effectively now. Either have their doctor weigh them, or try to gauge their weight, when you hold them.


The comparison to most bags of flour, may provide you a good estimate of how much they should weigh before you must allow them not to lay in your arms to suckle your breasts, as like a traditional baby.

Knowing their weight may help provide you an answer as to if they are still able to be properly held the traditional way or not.

, You may need to have them either kneel in front of you or in some other position, but to get them to continue (and still be quite comfy) to breastfeed, they'll still need to get a good latch (which requires the still close-bond between the two of you) on both your breasts' locations.

, Provide a massaging motion with your hands on your breasts, to give your breasts some time to recuperate between suckles.


Although most toddlers know how to burp and can now do it on their own without help, you won't need to help situate them on your shoulder. But you must encourage them to take a break occasionally, just like you were forced into doing when they were an infant/baby.

,


The only times when her feeding times can take longer is during naptime, nighttime, and waking up nursing sessions.

, Some toddlers may begin to spot activity around and may then become too involved and begin to want to wander off again to join in with the activity.

, Although toddlers need to get used to not belching every few moments, some will still need to release the gas build up inside them, but this will all depend on the age of the child and the length of time for which the child has been closely and effectively suckling at your breast.

, Nothing will have changed, with this part of the process.

Try breastfeeding almost immediately after birth.,
Request the baby stay in your room or be brought in for feedings.,
Offer the breast every single time the baby wants to feed.",How to Breastfeed a Newborn in the First Week After Birth1," The sooner you introduce your baby to the breast, the better your chances of having the baby accept and effectively breastfeed. It will also immediately prompt your body to begin the process of producing milk.;
, Having your baby nearby encourages the stimulation of important maternal hormones that promote milk production.


If you give birth in a hospital, request that the staff either allow your baby to remain in your room or be brought in every 1 to 2 hours–even overnight–for feeding.
Do not allow hospital staff to supplement your breastfeeding with sugar water or infant formula unless the baby has a medical need for additional calories, suffers from a feeding problem, or you are temporarily physically unable to attempt to breastfeed.

, Do not offer pacifiers and instruct medical staff at the hospital that you do not want the baby offered pacifiers or bottles. The more frequently you bring the baby to your breast to try to feed, the more your body will receive signals to produce milk and the more accustomed your baby will become to sucking effectively, which encourages the production and let-down of milk.

"
"
Do not expect immediate let-down of breast milk.,
Do not expect large quantities of breast milk.,
Get as much skin-to-skin contact with your baby as possible.,
Have faith in Mother Nature.",How to Breastfeed a Newborn in the First Week After Birth2," Many women have a delay of several hours or even days before breast milk supply fully arrives.


Let-down of milk may be delayed by medication, a surgical birth, or extended separation from your baby after birth. Do not get frustrated if your milk supply seems to be delayed, as most women take up to a week to get a full supply in their breasts on a regular basis.

, The first several days after your baby is born, you may only produce colostrum. Colostrum arrives before regular milk and is thick, yellowish fluid that provides high fat content and important antibodies and nutrients to your baby. In the first several days after birth, this is the only nutrition your baby is likely to need, and the amount you may produce during feeding will be small but adequate for your newborn.

, Direct contact with your baby encourages the release of hormones in your body that stimulate milk production and emotional bonding with your child. Cuddling and letting the baby rest on your bare skin will help signal your body to produce breast milk.

, The process of giving birth naturally signals your body to begin milk production.


Unless you have a medical condition or physical problem that precludes milk production (which is very rare), your body will produce what is necessary for your baby to consume during the first week. Your newborn’s stomach will be small, and his or her nutritional needs will be limited.
As your baby’s nutritional needs and stomach size grow, your milk supply will also increase, and your production will keep pace with or exceed your baby’s needs.

"
"
Request a visit from a professional breastfeeding advisor.,
Share your questions or concerns about breastfeeding.,
Be open about pain or problems.",How to Breastfeed a Newborn in the First Week After Birth3," Most hospitals or birthing centers staff lactation consultants, peer counselors, or nurses with expertise in breastfeeding.


Lactation consultants can offer useful tips, demonstrate appropriate technique, and let you know what is normal in terms of feeding frequency, milk consistency, pain or discomfort, infant appetite, and milk production.
Most institutions will set-up an in-room visit while you are at the hospital or schedule a home visit to enable you to see a breastfeeding counselor.

, Let the consultant know about your troubles or questions as soon as possible so that she can direct you toward the appropriate resource for help or correct problems early in the process.


Most counselors will have you attempt to breastfeed while they are present so that you can walk through the steps and get reassurance, feedback, or answers to any questions as they occur to you.

, Breastfeeding can be intimidating, especially if you are a first-time mother. If you suspect you do not have enough milk or if breastfeeding is causing pain in your nipple or breast, discuss this with the lactation consultant. She may be able to direct changes in position, the use of creams, or additional tips to encourage the let-down of milk and to make the feeding process comfortable and successful.

This is your opportunity to get on-the-ground reviews of pump products. Make sure to ask plenty of questions and if they still have the pump, request to see it as well.


You might ask, “What do you like about your pump? What do you dislike? Why?” or “Would you purchase this same pump again? Why?” Avoid yes/no questions and you will get lengthier and more helpful responses.
The advice of a friend with similar pumping needs will be the most useful. For example, if you are planning to pump while at work, seek out someone who does that as well.;
, Go to a major search engine and look for various types of pumps. Browse through the photos to see if any pump appeals to you right away. For example, if you want something simple you may want to shy away from the pump with a million dials on the front. Look for reviews online as well. Most shopping sites will carry links to reviews that you can read instantly.As you read reviews, pay particular attention to any mention of defects or customer service issues. You do not want to purchase a pump from a brand with a history of technical problems.
Search for instruction manuals for various brands of breast pumps. Read the manuals of your top three pumps to determine the ease of usage. Can you understand the manual? Will you feel comfortable operating this pump?

, There are tons of free chat groups and forums devoted to mothering, breastfeeding, and pumping in general. Sign up for a couple of these a few weeks before you will need to buy your pump. Spend some time reading the posts and ask questions of the members. Once you’ve decided on a model, post it online and request feedback.


You post could read something like, “Hi, everyone, I’ve decided to go with model XYZ. Has anyone had good or bad experiences with this pump before?”
If you really like a particular pump, don’t let anyone scare you away from purchasing it. After all, a person’s experience is personal and not always reflective of what will happen to you.

, Go to a brick-and-mortar store that carries breast pumps and take a look at the various options. If the store has pumps on display, go ahead and physically feel them. Take apart the pieces and put them back together. Assess the weight of the pump and the quality of the materials. Does the plastic seem sturdy? Do the dials move easily?Some store websites offer virtual breast pump “tours” as well. This is a good option if you don’t feel comfortable handling a breast pump in a traditional store.

, Once you find a model that you like, you'll want to search for the lowest price. Check the ads for local baby and maternity stores. Visit the stores in person and see if they have rewards programs. They may even offer to price match, just in case you find a better price elsewhere.


Don't forget to look online as well. Many baby stores offer special online deals. Online dealers also price competitively as well.

, If you're having trouble choosing, try determining how you will use it. Try to imagine going through a typical day and when and where you intend to pump, how much time you will have for each session, and your milk production goals for each session (in ounces). You can even write out a rough outline if this helps.


As you are planning your schedule, keep in mind that it is generally best to pump for 15 – 30 minutes per session.
Be aware that your pumping routine may alter depending on how well your letdown reflex responds to manual stimulation. If your milk comes faster, you may be able to shorten sessions. Or, if your milk takes its time, you may need to allot an additional “letdown” time for each session.
You will probably hear about “hospital grade” pumps while shopping. These pumps are made for heavy use in medical facilities and, on occasion, for individual consumers. Many women with NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) babies will use them to kick-start their milk supply.These can be rented, so you don't need to buy a hospital-grade pump. The hospital should be able to help you locate one to rent.

, These are two primary categories of breast pumps. If you are only planning to pump occasionally to relieve engorgement or provide enough milk for a night out, a manual pump might be sufficient (and less expensive, too). If you plan to pump multiple times per day while at work or to feed your baby from a bottle exclusively, invest in an electric pump which will pump your milk more quickly and efficiently.


Both models draw milk out of the breast by creating a vacuum between the breast shield (the part that goes over the nipple area) and the pump’s milk storage container (usually a plastic bottle attached to the shield directly or via tubing). They differ in how the vacuum is created, whether by manual power or by electrical energy.With a manual breast pump you will squeeze on a lever to create a vacuum which will then extract the milk. This can be a tedious and time-consuming process. But, manual pumps are generally affordable, fairly lightweight, and allow for easy transport.With an electric breast pump you will place the breast shield against your nipple and turn a dial to start milk extraction. Electric pumps can be loud and are heavier in weight and larger in size. They are also more costly and require an energy source (an outlet or batteries).
Electric pumps, unlike manual ones, also usually have adjustable settings for suction rate and suction strength. This allows you to closely imitate the actions of a baby sucking, prompting more milk production.

, Electric pumps come in two forms: those powered by batteries and those powered by electrical outlets. If you have another young child and will need to stay mobile while pumping, a battery-operated pump might be a good choice. If you are planning to pump at your desk while at work or another stationary location, an electric pump would produce more milk for your time spent.You can move around with a battery pump, but you will run through lots of batteries over time with heavy use. Battery pumps are a good compromise measure for women who want to move while pumping but plan to pump too frequently to use manual methods. They are also fall in the middle in terms of cost, cheaper than plug-ins but more expensive than manual.
Plug-in pumps are usually heavier than battery pumps; however, they also extract milk more quickly and are the standard choice for full-time pumpers.

, This choice really depends on the amount of milk that you need to produce, your time constraints, and your budget. If you plan to breastfeed full time and use your pumped milk only as a supplement, you will be fine with a single-pump. If you plan to feed your baby on pumped milk alone, it would be best to go with a double-pump. You'll get more milk per session and your sessions will gradually reduce in time.As the name suggests, single pumps are used on one breast at a time. Double-pumps let you drain both breasts simultaneously.
If you decide on a double-pump, you may want to purchase or make a pumping bra. This is a bra that will hold the breast shields to your body while pumping, freeing your hands. You can buy one at most maternity stores or make one by cutting holes for each nipple in a sports bra., After you buy the pump that you want, spend some time putting it together and practicing using it. Pay particular attention to the accessories that come with the pump. For example, do you like the size of the milk storage bottle? Do the breast shields fit you?


Many women purchase additional breast shields. Breast pumps usually come with one size and some women need to go larger or smaller in order to achieve a good nipple fit. Pumping with the wrong size shield can cause many problems, including clogged ducts.If your pump comes with a carrying case, practice packing up the pump and toting it around. If it doesn’t come with a case, think of modifying a backpack or large purse for this purpose, especially if you intend to pump while at work.

, Breast pumps are costly, so it is tempting to consider buying used or second-hand. A pump is considered a medical device and you must proceed carefully both for your health and that of your baby. You always want to purchase a pump from a reputable, trustworthy source.A pump must be designated “multiple user” in order to be safe. That means that you can separate all of the parts, except the main pump itself, and sanitize everything. You will want the pump professionally sanitized before use.
Be aware, though, that the stakes are high. If your pump is not sanitized properly or is in fact a single-user model, you could transmit contagious bacteria or viruses via your milk. For example, hepatitis and HIV can live within pump mechanisms.If you use a temporary pump at the hospital, you will notice that these are hospital-grade and designed for multiple use. You will also receive a separate package of sterilized accessories-shields, tubing, and milk containers-all designated for your personal use.

, Even if your pump comes with a nice carrying case, it can be a real hassle to take it back and forth between home and work. If you plan on pumping multiple times in a day, and at different locations, you might consider buying two pumps. One pump can stay at work and the other at home.

, To start pumping, you will usually need to buy more than just the pump alone. Create a budget that includes extra milk containers, extra (or different sized) shields, cleaning brushes, a drying rack, a carrying case, etc.Some pumps are sold in “bundle packs” with additional bottles and storage bags. This might be a good option if you plan to pump large quantities of milk.

, Before you purchase, read about the warranty plans that are offered by various pump manufacturers. Most have time limits of a year or so, but many last for a lifetime of use. Be aware that most stores, for health safety reasons, will not accept a returned pump unless the package is unopened., Call your insurance carrier and ask about their pump coverage policies. Insurance companies are required to cover breast pumps, though which pumps are covered is at the discretion of the insurance company. They often have a variety of other rules, including that the pump cannot be purchased until after the baby is born. Contact your insurance company before the baby is born so you can get the necessary paperwork done as soon as the baby is born.


While the covered pumps are usually cheaper models, free is always a good place to start.

Make yourself a nursing station.,
Wear comfortable clothes for nursing.,
Learn to breastfeed before your baby arrives.,
Don't give your baby a pacifier right away.",How to Breastfeed1," Try feeding when sitting in a large comfortable chair, recliner or sofa; any of these will make it easier to settle down to nurse. Keep a large water bottle nearby, or even a good snack to fight the hunger that can come suddenly to a new mother. Ideally, the station could be near the baby's crib so you can feed the baby as quickly as possible.


It depends on your circumstances and perspective: some women are perfectly comfortable nursing in public, while others only do so in private.;
, A nursing bra or tank can help you feed more easily in public, if you're comfortable with that. But really, any soft, comfortable button-down shirts will do just fine and will be easy to bunch and to give your baby easy access to your breasts. The more skin to skin you share with the baby, the more stimulated he will be, so there's no need for you or your baby to wear a million layers.

, Get help from a maternity nurse either before or right after your baby is born, or even enroll in a prenatal breastfeeding class. This can help you be relaxed and ready on the day when your baby arrives -- and he'll be hungry when he does.

, Though a pacifier will certainly do the trick -- pacify your baby -- it may make it more difficult for you to breastfeed. To keep your baby focused on sucking on your breasts instead of the pacifier, you shouldn't give him or her one until your baby reaches 3-4 weeks old. That will be enough time for your baby to become accustomed to breastfeeding. There are also arguments for using the pacifier right away; do your research to learn what's best for you and your child."

Wear comfortable clothing.,
Consider using a nursing cover.,
Find a safe spot to breastfeed.,
Breastfeed in a sling or carrier.,
Practice your setup.",How to Breastfeed in Public1," Choose clothing that covers most of your chest and waist while still giving you access to your breasts. You may want to wear layers of clothing that you can remove or pull up in order to breastfeed. For example, you can wear shirts with straps that are easy to pull down or shirts that have flaps you can lift away in order to breastfeed. Ensure that you can easily manage your clothing or nursing bra one handed since you may need to hold your baby as well.Many nursing tank tops are great for public breastfeeding since you can simply unclip one side at a time. This will give your baby access to a breast while keeping the other breast covered.;
, If you'd like to cover as much of your baby and breasts as possible while you nurse, you may want to wear a nursing cover. These are usually adjustable cloths that wrap around your shoulders and arms to provide coverage. Keep in mind that these usually work best for small babies since older babies begin to pull them away.If you don't have a cover, you could drape a scarf or baby blanket over your baby and your breasts. Again, these work best for small babies who won't kick them off or pull them away.

, Choose a place to breastfeed based on your comfort level. Some women prefer to nurse in busy, open spaces (such as benches at the park or at the table of a cafe) while others like quieter spaces (like a children's area at a library or museum). Regardless of where you choose, the place should be safe for you to focus on breastfeeding your baby.You can look for a universal breastfeeding symbol to find a location that's designated as breastfeeding friendly. You can usually find these in malls, public parks, and at libraries.

, If you'd like to discreetly feed your baby while you're on the go, learn how to breastfeed your baby while it's in a baby carrier or sling. Follow the manufacturer's instructions that came with the carrier or sling to ensure that your baby is positioned correctly and can easily breathe., If you're concerned about nursing discreetly, practice public nursing in the private space of your home. Use anything you plan to use when nursing in public. Consider nursing in front of a mirror so you can see how exposed you are.

Practicing before you head out will also help you decide if your clothing or nursing cover is comfortable.

"
"
Wear nursing clothing.,
Modify your regular clothes.,
Use a cover up.,
Nurse in a sling.",How to Discreetly Breastfeed Your Baby on the Go1," Nursing tops can be purchased at maternity stores and most major clothing retailers. These tops have hidden openings that allow you to easily feed your baby. You can get a variety of items such as tops, bras, and dresses.Nursing bras that are made like sports bras are usually better. You will not have to worry about fidgeting with any straps or fastenings.;
, Button up shirts, front-zip sweatshirts, or oversize shirts and sweaters are options as well. Wear a tank or camisole under t-shirts that will hide your midsection if your t-shirt is pulled up. Lift your shirt just enough to allow access to the nipple while the rest of your breast is covered.Cut slits in an old t-shirt and wear it under an oversized shirt or sweater. Then you can just pull up your top shirt to nurse.
Dresses are not ideal. If you do wear a dress, it should open from the front., The two types of nursing covers you can purchase are canopies and wearable covers. Canopies are like wearing an apron around your neck. You just throw it on when you are ready to feed. Wearable covers are worn as part of your outfit (e.g. nursing poncho, nursing scarf) and are meant to blend in a little more.Take extra caution when using a cover. If your baby falls asleep when eating under the cover, they might not be getting enough oxygen. Babies typically make grunting and gulping sounds when eating. If your baby stops sucking or becomes too quiet, they may be falling asleep.
Choose a cover with a plain design. Bright colors and patterns will draw more attention to you.
The cover should be washable and made from a breathable fabric.
If you do not want to purchase a cover, you can always use a blanket or large scarf of your own.
Your baby may not like nursing with a cover up. Try it at home first to see if your baby will be comfortable with it.

, Soft carriers and slings are a good way to nurse in public.Adjust your baby’s head so that it is level with your breast and then lift your breast to your baby’s mouth. Their head should be opposite of the part that goes over your shoulder. If you plan to stand up, make sure your baby’s bottom is supported.Some slings are made especially for nursing. If you are not using a nursing sling, make sure that it is adjustable and can be used for nursing.
Any sling you use should be washable, adjustable, and comfortable.

"

Position your baby in the sling.,
Make sure your baby is lying at the proper height.,
Release your breast.,
Place your baby on your breast.,
Support your baby’s head.,
Cover your breasts if desired.",How to Breastfeed in a Baby Carrier1," Newborn babies usually breastfeed in a lying-down position, so ring slings are ideal. Start by positioning your baby correctly in the sling. His or her head should be on the opposite side of the rings – in other words, if the rings are on your left shoulder, the baby’s head should be on the right side of your chest, so that you can offer the right breast for feeding.;
, Your baby’s head should be at chest level – not too high and not too low – so that he or she can be fed easily. Adjust the rings until the fit is correct.

, Lean forward to make some space between you and your baby. If you have a shirt with buttons, undo them until you can fit your breast through the hole; otherwise, you can simply lift your shirt above your breast. Remove your bra, or lift your breast over the bra cup.


Nursing bras can be tremendously helpful; they make it much easier to provide your baby access. However, normal bras will work; just lift your breast over the cup.

, Bring your breast to your baby’s mouth, holding with one hand until your baby is suckling securely.

, If your baby is a newborn, you will need to hold his or her head with one hand for support. For older babies, who can hold their heads better, you can simply tuck the sling securely under the head.

, If you’re worried about privacy or discretion, arrange the cloth of the sling to cover your breast and your baby’s head. Most people will not even know what you are doing.

Feed your newborn regularly and often.,
Avoid hunching to feed.,
Support your baby's body and head.,
Aim your nipple at the top of your baby's mouth.,
Let your baby feed as long as he wants to on the first breast.,
Burp your baby (optional).,
Get used to the feeding and sleeping routine.",How to Breastfeed2," All newborn babies typically need to nurse at least every two to three hours and may sleep 5 hours in a row once every 24 hours. Awaken the baby during the day at first every few hours so the long sleep period will be at night. Babies vary in the amount of time they take to nurse at each feeding. Let the baby decide he is finished with the first side. Note that the breast has natural anti-bacterial properties, so it is not necessary to wash your hands and breasts before each nursing. The breast has Montgomery glands that keep the nipple bacteria free.


When you first give birth, prepare to breastfeed between 0 and 2 hours of your baby's birth. You'll want him to get used to breastfeeding as soon as possible.

, The best place for your baby to nurse is in your own arms, lifted up across your body, tummy to tummy. Your goal is to be sitting straight up and leaning back a bit, so that you feel relaxed and comfortable. If you are hunching or leaning over, it will be painful for you and difficult for the baby to latch. Although you should not use a pillow to support baby, you can use one in your lap to support your arms.


Support your back with a pillow to make it easier for you to hold your baby.

, There are many effective ways to hold a baby and nurse, including the cradle hold, cross cradle hold, and football hold. Whatever position you choose, look for a straight line, from ear to shoulder to hip. Hold the baby close so that his chest is close to yours and he is looking straight ahead or up a little.


Cradling your baby close to you should do the trick to keep you from needing to hunch over.

, Do this when your baby opens his or her mouth widely so that the nipple basically lays down on baby's tongue. If it doesn't open wide naturally, encourage your baby to open his mouth by gently touching his lips and mouth. Pull your baby towards you with pressure on the back, not by pushing on the head. When baby latches, it should feel like pulling, not pinching.


Keep one hand supporting your baby's back and one hand on your breast.

, Some babies are more ""efficient"" than others, some like to nurse longer. Depending on how much milk a mother makes, a baby may not take the second side. Just make sure to switch between breasts when you start a new feeding. Listen for rhythmic, regular sucking that will let you know the baby has latched properly.


When your baby feeds from your breast, it should feel like a gentle pull, not a pinch or a bite.
When your baby is done feeding on a breast, you shouldn't pull or even yank him away. Instead, insert your finger in his mouth so that his mouth releases your breast.

, This isn't always necessary. Depending on how much air the baby takes in through the nose while it is nursing, you may or may not need to burp baby. If your baby is arching his back, squirming around, and looking uncomfortable, then he may be ready to get burped. Try to burp him in one of these ways:Lift your baby toward your shoulder, with your hand on his head and neck for support. He should be facing the area behind you. Rub your baby's back with a firm and open hand to release the trapped air.
Sit your baby on your lap and lean him forward, supporting his chest with the base of your hand and his chin and neck with your fingers. Massage his stomach with your front hand and gently pat his back with the hand on his back.
Lie your baby on your lap with his head raised higher than his stomach. Gently pat his back until he burps.

, A newborn baby will mostly nurse and sleep. You know when the baby is ""getting enough"" when there are 8-10 wet and or dirty diapers. Though this routine will be repetitive and you won't have as much time to play with your baby, it'll give you time to get some of that much-needed rest you must be missing so badly.

Maintain a healthy diet.,
Stay hydrated.,
Avoid alcohol at least two hours before you breastfeed.,
Avoid smoking.,
Be careful with the medication you take.",How to Breastfeed3," Not eating healthy may have an impact on mother's health, as most nutrients are translated into breast milk and mother essentially gets the ""left-overs"" Many mothers also continue to take prenatal vitamins or should take daily multivitamins to stay healthy. Eat plenty of veggies, fruits, and grains, and avoid overly fatty or greasy foods in favor of foods with nutritional value.Though you may be eager to drop that baby weight, now is not the time to go on an extreme diet -- unless you want to deprive your baby of the proper nutrients he needs.

, If you want to be healthy and produce enough milk for your baby and to remain healthy, then you have to stay hydrated. Drink at least 8 oz. of water eight times a day, and add some juice, milk, or other healthy drinks into your routine., The American Academy of Pediatrics states that it's not harmful for a woman of average size to drink up to 2 glasses of wine or two beers during the time when she is breastfeeding (though not during breastfeeding, obviously). However, the doctors also recommend that you should wait at least two hours after consuming alcohol to breastfeed your baby.Additionally, you should pump your breasts in advance if you know you'll be drinking and won't be able to breastfeed for a little while.

, Smoking can not only change the amount of your breast milk supply, but it can change the taste of your breast milk, and can make it much less appealing to your baby. This is the last thing you want. If you're breastfeeding, ditch the cigarettes., Though you'll be just fine breastfeeding your baby while taking a number of medications, you should always check with your doctor to make sure it's okay to take any of your medications, or a new medication, while you're breastfeeding."
"
Know your rights.,
Respond to judgments calmly.,
Take someone with you.,
Calm down.",How to Breastfeed in Public2," When it comes to nursing in the United States and a number of other countries (such as Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K.), breastfeeding is not considered indecent exposure. You may freely feed your child and expose your breasts without a cover in public places., If you are worried about judgmental looks or being criticized by strangers, remind others that your baby has a right to eat whenever it's hungry. Stay positive and you can remind them that breastfeeding in public is nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about.For example, if someone tells you to do it elsewhere, calmly say that your baby is hungry and you have a legal right to breastfeed your baby.

, If this is one of your first times nursing in public, bring a supportive person along to put you at ease. Your partner, a friend, or your mother could keep you company and help you feel more relaxed. They may also help by holding the baby while you get ready to breastfeed.


If you have a friend who's also breastfeeding, ask if they'd like to go with you. Having a person with experience in breastfeeding publicly can boost your confidence.

, Set reasonable expectations for yourself. It may take a few times breastfeeding in public before you feel relaxed about doing it. Learn what calms you down and practice it when you begin to feel anxious or overwhelmed. For example, you might find that taking deep breaths or repeating a mantra relaxes you.You'll probably find that breastfeeding in public gets easier once you've done it a few times and made a few adjustments.

Learn early hunger signs.,
Practice at home.,
Prepare for criticism.",How to Discreetly Breastfeed Your Baby on the Go2," If you feed your baby when you first notice they are hungry, your baby will be more relaxed. A fussy and/or crying baby will draw a lot of attention. Your baby may display typical signs of hunger, or they may have unique signals that they want to eat. Pay attention to how your baby acts when they are hungry so you can easily read their cues. Typical signs of hunger are:Hand and/or finger sucking
Turning their head towards your breast
Making sucking noises with their mouth

, Nursing in the comfort of your own home is much different than nursing in public. You do not know how your baby will react to being covered or more confined when eating. Nurse at home exactly as you would if you were in public. This includes your outfit, your cover up, and possibly working with one hand or in a confined space.Latch without exposing your entire breast.
Nurse in front of the mirror so you can see how much you are exposing.
You will be more confident in public because you know how you actually look to other people, and you have an idea of how your baby will respond.
You can also nurse in front of someone you are comfortable with and get their feedback on how much they can actually see.

, You do not want to be caught off guard if another person complains or a manager tells you that you need to go to the bathroom. Have a response ready in case this happens. It is your choice how you address the issue.Educate yourself about your state's laws regarding breastfeeding in public. In almost every state in the United States (Idaho is the only exception) you are legally protected and can breastfeed wherever and whenever you want.You can ignore the comment.
You can talk to the person about the importance and benefits of breastfeeding.
You can make a joke about the situation.
You can ask the person questions about their viewpoint and why they feel the way they do.
You can show empathy and tell the person that you understand their discomfort with you breastfeeding in public.
If you are asked to go to the bathroom, you may say, “No, I’m fine. We don’t eat in bathrooms.” Or “No, thank you. Bathrooms aren’t for eating.”
If a customer complains, you may say, “I understand. If you sit at the table over there, you will not be able to see us and may be more comfortable.”

Scout out a destination.,
Turn away to latch.,
Control leaking.,
Go to your car.,
Sit against a wall.,
Be confident.",How to Discreetly Breastfeed Your Baby on the Go3," Any time you are out, identify a place that you can breastfeed if you need to. Once you notice that your baby needs to eat, you will know where to go.Find a place where you can sit comfortably with some back support. Good places to feed in public include:Dressing rooms
Secluded booth in a restaurant
Your car
A bench that is next to a large planter
A window seat on a bus
Lactation room or lactation lounge
If there is not an obvious place you can go, ask a worker if there is anywhere private you can go because you need to feed your baby. People are often accommodating and will find a place for you.

, Most of your skin will be exposed when your baby is latching on. If you are not in a completely private area, turn away to latch for more privacy. Once your baby has latched on, you can turn back in the other direction. Do this for latching and unlatching.For example if you are in a booth in the back of the restaurant and facing other customers, you would face the wall to latch and unlatch.

, It is normal for one breast to leak while nursing on the other or leak when you see another baby or hear a baby cry. Wear nursing pads in your bra to protect your clothes. You can also place a towel or burp cloth over your other breast while you are nursing.If you do not want to buy nursing pads, fold cotton handkerchiefs and place them in your bra.
Avoid using plastic lined pads because they do not allow your nipples to breathe.
Patterned clothing also conceals leakage better than solid colored clothing.

, If you cannot find anywhere else to nurse, you can always go back to your car. The parking lot is semi-private, and pedestrians rarely notice the baby because they are positioned just below the line of visibility through the car window.


Keep a small pillow in the car. This helps with positioning, although resting the infant in the crook of your elbow in the cradle position is stable enough if you do not have a pillow to prop up under your arm.

, In crowded situations, sit next to a window or against a wall. Position your body towards the wall with your opposite shoulder so your chest is somewhat shielded from the rest of the passengers or crowd. Expose only your nipple to the baby and you should be able to maintain discretion even in close quarters.


This method works well in airplanes or busses.

, Breastfeeding in public becomes easier the more you do it. Remember that breastfeeding is natural, and you are doing what is best for your baby. If someone makes eye contact with you smile at them. Your smile shows that you are confident and not embarrassed.Talk to other breastfeeding moms about their experiences and to get some tips.

Position your baby in the carrier.,
Adjust the height.,
Release your breast.,
Place your baby on your breast.,
Offer your baby your breast.,
Support your baby’s head.,
Cover your breasts if desired.",How to Breastfeed in a Baby Carrier2," If your baby likes to nurse in an upright position, a structured carrier may be the best choice for you. Pass your baby’s arms and legs through the openings and then, together with the stretcher, pull the carrier to your chest. Set the straps on your shoulders, and hold your baby with one hand while you fasten the carrier with the other.

, Loosen the straps until your baby is lowered to the desired height, with his or her head against your chest. Always hold onto your baby with one hand, and be sure to secure the carrier well after you adjust it.

, If you have a shirt with buttons, undo them until you can fit your breast through the hole; otherwise, you can simply lift your shirt above your breast. Remove your bra, or lift your breast over the bra cup.


Nursing bras can be tremendously helpful; they make it much easier to provide your baby access. However, normal bras will work; just lift your breast over the cup.

, Bring your breast to your baby’s mouth, holding with one hand until your baby is suckling securely.

, Hold your breast with one hand until your baby is suckling securely.

, If your carrier has head protection, use it. Otherwise, hold your baby’s head with one hand.

, If you are concerned about privacy or discretion, use your shirt to cover whatever parts you can. Be sure you give your baby room to breathe and nurse, though.

Apply a soothing compress on sore nipples.",How to Avoid Sore Nipples While Breast Feeding," Rather than wait until your baby starts crying or really pulling at your breasts, you should watch for early hunger cues from your baby and try to feed them as soon as possible. A very hungry baby can grab at your nipples and suck on them hard, leading to sore nipples. Feed your baby as soon as they start to get fussy or close to their normal feeding time to avoid sore nipples.For newborns, you should try to do eight to twelve feeds every 24 hours, keeping the feedings consistent and close to the same time. This will prevent your baby from sucking too hard due to hunger.
If your newborn baby is not feeding every three hours, you should hand-express out the milk or pump the milk out into bottles. This will prevent your breasts from becoming engorged. Engorged breasts can lead to the development of flat nipples, which will make it more difficult for your baby to latch on and feed.;
, If your breasts are feeling tender, you may want to get your baby to feed on the side that is not as sore first. This will give the sore breast a break.This will also prevent your sore breast from becoming more irritated and allow your baby to get used to feeding from both breasts.

, Sit on a couch or a chair and use pillows to support your lower back, as well as your arms. You should support your feet on a footrest or on a stack of pillows. This will help to make you and your baby feel comfortable during the feeding., Make sure your baby is tucked up close to you, with your tummies touching each other. Place a supporting hand or arm behind your baby’s shoulders, rather than their head. Their face should be facing towards your nipple. Your baby should not have to turn or adjust their head to reach your breast. It should be easily accessible.


Another way to view this positioning is to ensure your nipple is pointed towards your baby’s nose. This will allow them to open their mouth and tip their head back, sliding the nipple towards the roof of their mouth.

, Cup your breast with your free hand and place it close to your baby’s mouth. It should not be pressing on your baby’s chin or be far away from your baby’s mouth. This will allow your baby to move towards your breast and drive their chin into your breast., Most babies will move their heads towards their mother’s breasts and latch on their own. You baby may bob their head a little and consider before doing this, but self-latching is one the best ways to ensure a pain free and effective latch.If your baby does not seem to be able to self-latch, you can encourage them to open their mouth wide by using your nipple to tickle their lips. Say “open” as you do this and make sure your breast is almost touching their nose. They should then allow you to attach your breast to their mouth., Many babies can have a shallow latch, where they do not latch onto your breast properly. An improper latch can lead to a sore nipple. Check that your baby is latched on correctly to your breast by checking that their mouth is wrapped around your entire areola and their lips are pursed outward around your areola.You should also make sure your baby maintains an open mouth during the feeding and their chin is indenting the lower portion of your breast.

, If you start to feel any discomfort or pain once your baby latches on to your breast, you should re position their mouth on your breast. Try to do this while they are nursing by pressing on your baby’s shoulder lightly to bring their closer to you. You can also use your free hand to tip their head back a little more or shift their position against your body slightly.If you need to remove your baby from your breast at any time during the feeding, use a clean finger to do this. Place the finger into the corner of your baby’s mouth or between your baby’s gums to break the seal between your baby’s mouth and your breast. You can also try pulling down lightly on your baby’s chin or pressing down on your breast, next to your baby’s mouth, to break the seal.Never just pull the baby off without breaking the suction first. This can damage the nipple.

, Exposing your breasts to air will also help them stay dry and possibly make breastfeeding less uncomfortable.You can buy feeding bras that are made of natural, breathable fibers so they do not irritate your breasts. They are usually also made so you can unhook them easily for feeding time.
You can also buy breast shells, which are donut shaped plastic shells that you can place on your breasts to protect your nipples. These can be placed inside your bra or your shirt to protect sore nipples.

, You can also soften breasts to prepare for the feeding by using your hands to gently massage them. Do this a few minutes before feeding time so there is stimulation of your breast milk.Another option is to pump your breasts for a few minutes using a hand pump to get the milk flowing. This may then make your nipples less sore and sensitive during feeding.
This can also help elevate flat nipples and allow the baby to latch better to help prevent sore nipples.

, Exposing your body to a warm environment can help to stimulate milk production in your breasts. Some mothers will have a brief warm shower right before feeding time.You can also try applying a warm towel to your breasts to soothe any discomfort and help stimulate milk flow.

, Staying calm and relaxed before and during the feeding can help to make breastfeeding less painful and uncomfortable. You may do some deep breathing, where you breathe in and out deeply for six to eight breaths, or a five minute meditation, where you sit in silence for five minutes. A calm and relaxed mindset can help take the stress out of breastfeeding., Try to do this by lightly squeezing your breasts with your hands. Expressing a small amount of milk before feeding can help to encourage milk flow and activate the let down reflexes in your breasts. Your baby will then do less hard sucking, and put less stress, on your breasts during feeding.Avoid using a strong breast pump to do this, as breast pumps can make your nipples feel sore or become cracked.

, A baby with a tongue-tie has difficulty lifting their tongue or moving forward normally. This can lead to issues during breastfeeding, as they cannot extract milk from your breast effectively. They may end up pushing your nipple up with their tongue, which can cause pain to their palate and discomfort on your nipple.You can check to see if your baby can stick their tongue out past their bottom lip. You should also note if they can lift their tongue to the roof of their mouth when they cry. If they cannot make these movements, you should have your doctor check them for tongue-tie.
If your baby has tongue-tie, your doctor can clip the membrane that is restricting your baby’s tongue. This can then lead to more effective feeding sessions with your baby.

, Thrush is a fungal infection that can infect you and your baby. Thrush can cause irritation and redness on your nipples, as well as cracks and white patches. It can also appear in your baby’s mouth as white patches. Thrush can also affect your milk ducts, making it difficult and painful to breastfeed your baby properly.Your doctor can confirm you have thrush and prescribe treatment.

, If your nipples become very sore and cracked while you are breastfeeding, you get your doctor to check if they are infected. Your doctor may recommend safe, topical medication to treat infected nipples.If you have a breast infection, known as mastitis, your doctor can give you oral antibiotics that are safe for use while you are breastfeeding.

, If you already have cracks or sore areas developing on your nipples, you can use your own breast milk to help soothe them. Take your finger and rub a small amount of breast milk on your breasts before and after the feeding to encourage healing.Avoid using any irritating substances on your nipples, such as soap or shampoo that contains alcohol or creams that contain irritating ingredients. Do not use cream that contains Vitamin E, as this can be toxic for your baby.You should also be very gentle when cleaning your breasts in the shower. Use mild antibacterial soap and soft towels so your nipples do not become more irritated or sore.

, If your nipples are very sore, you can apply a soothing warm compress (a clean washcloth soaked in lukewarm water) on your nipples to reduce any swelling or discomfort.


You can also try using medical grade lanolin ointment on your nipples to help with soreness or cracking; however, studies have shown that breast milk is more effective for sore, cracked nipples than lanolin ointment.You can take a mild pain reliever 30 minutes prior to nursing if your nipples are painful. Mild pain relievers are considered safe for breastfeeding. If you have any concerns, talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medications.Do not apply teabags to cracked, sore nipples, as this is a folk remedy that has been shown to be ineffective."

See a lactation consultant.",How to Achieve a Good Latch when Breastfeeding," How you sit or lie is an important part of getting a good latch. Find a comfortable chair or sofa that has great back support or lie in your bed. This can make you comfortable, which may ease breastfeeding and help you get a good latch.Try out different places to sit until you find one that makes you most comfortable while breastfeeding. Using a stool or ottoman to rest your feet can help with good posture and prevent strain in your neck and shoulders. This position is the easiest for breastfeeding.Consider reclining to a 45 degree angle, which may take some of the burden off of you and help your baby latch better.Lie on your side if it is more comfortable for you than sitting. The side-lying position may be better for night- or nap-nursing or if you’ve had a C-section.;
, Using a pillow to support your baby can make a big difference in getting your baby to latch properly. It brings the baby up to the level of your breast and can also prevent strain in your arms, neck, and back. Put a breastfeeding pillow or any pillow you may have on your lap once you’ve found a comfortable position.Any pillow will work, but you may need more than one regular pillow to be comfortable and encourage the best latch. A pillow designed specifically for nursing, such as those made by the brand Boppy, may be a better option.

, It’s important for you to be comfortable when breastfeeding, but it’s also crucial that your child lie in a cozy position. This can promote a good latch and make breastfeeding easier and more enjoyable for your and your child.Nestle your baby in one of your arms—choose which one is most comfortable for you. Make sure the baby’s neck rests in the bend of your elbow, their back along the forearm, and their buttocks in your hand. This type of support makes swallowing easier. You can check this by seeing if your baby’s ear, shoulder and hip are aligned. The baby’s nose should be opposite your nipple.Bring your baby to you and don’t lean into them. This helps prevent strain to your neck and shoulders.
Make sure your baby’s tummy is facing your stomach. Pull them close to you and make sure the baby is still properly aligned.This skin-to-skin contact stimulates your baby’s natural reflexes to breastfeed.Place any flailing arms under the baby’s body or into the soft pocket of your midriff. Swaddling your baby can also keep arms from flailing., Before you offer your child your breast, it’s important that they are awake and alert. A sleepy child won’t be able to nurse properly. You can say your child’s name and gently talk to them until they are awake or alert enough to nurse.Unwrap your child if they are in a blanket. The chill will wake them. Skin-to-skin can also help the baby breastfeed better when you are still teaching the baby to breastfeed.
Change the child’s diaper before you start nursing, which can also cause a baby to wake from the chill.
Rub your child’s feet gently to get them to wake up before or during nursing.
Calm and soothe your baby before you start breastfeeding if they are crying or fussy.

, Before you guide your baby to the nipple, squeeze out a few drops of milk. This can help your baby find your nipple and may make breastfeeding easier and more comfortable for you and your baby.Avoid moistening your nipple with oils or creams that may be harmful to your baby. If milk isn’t moistening your breast enough, try a medical-grade, modified lanolin ointment., Your baby might need some help finding your nipple and areola. Gently squeezing your breast in a “C” or “U” hold can guide your nipple to your baby’s mouth.Grasp your breast on its sides. A “C” hold will grasp the sides of your breast making a “C” shape with your hand from the outside of the breast. A “U” hold grasps the sides of the breast from underneath. Keep your fingers far from your nipple so that they don’t affect your baby’s ability to latch properly.

, Tilt your baby’s head back slightly as you lift them to your nipple.This should stimulate your baby to open their mouth wide, giving you a chance to gently give your child your nipple., A wide-open mouth is the most important part of a good latch. Babies’ mouths close as quickly as they open, so it’s important to make sure their mouth stays open to achieve a good latch.Tickle your baby’s lower lip with your nipple to encourage them to open their mouth really wide. This will allow you to direct your nipple into the center of the mouth. You can talk to your baby and say, “Open,” to get them to open wide.
Use the index finger of your hand supporting the breast to gently push down the baby’s chin. This can also get them to open wide.
Avoid getting discouraged. It may take a few tries to get your baby to open their mouth wide.

, You want your baby to get as much of your nipple and lower areola, which is the area around your nipple, in their mouth as possible. This encourages a good latch as well as comfort for you and your baby. Seeing if your baby’s lips are flanged out like fish lips is a good way to figure out if they are properly positioned on your breast.Pull gently on the baby’s upper or lower lip to achieve a wider latch. Their chin should indent the lower part of your breast if you’ve done this.
Keep squeezing your breast in a “C” or “U” hold to help ensure that your baby gets as much of the nipple and areola as possible., Once you’ve placed your baby on your breast and checked for fish lips, you may want to look for other signs of a good latch. You likely have a good latch if:You can see the baby’s tongue when you pull down their bottom lip
The baby’s ears wiggle
The baby’s jaw moves in a circular motion rather than the chin moving rapidly
The baby’s cheeks are rounded
You don’t hear any clicking or smacking
You hear swallowing
The baby’s nose or chin is touching your breast
Your breast and nipple are not flat or misshapen when the baby comes off of your breast
Discomfort ends quickly after your baby latches on
Your baby shows the signs of satisfaction at the end of the feeding such as open hands, looking relaxed, “falling” off of your breast or falling asleep
You are relaxedYour baby is sucking the nipple and areola

, There are three common challenges that you may face when breastfeeding: painful nursing, back pain, and a fussy baby.You can easily fix these problems by changing how you’re feeding. Nursing should never be painful or cause discomfort.If you have continuous pain when nursing, it can be the sign of a bad latch. Trying for a better latch may relieve any pain you’re experiencing and help your baby feed properly.Remember that a little discomfort is normal when your baby is first latching to your breast. If it continues after this, break the suction by placing a finger between your baby’s lip and your skin. Remove your baby from your breast and try for a better latch.
See your doctor as soon as possible if you have pain accompanied by swelling, warmth, and redness. You may also have a fever and chills. These can be signs of mastitis, which is an infection of breast tissue that most commonly affects nursing mothers., You may also experience back pain when you’re nursing. This is often caused by leaning forward to nurse instead of pulling your baby close to you. You can relieve the pain by sitting up straight and repositioning your baby so that they are at the level of your breast.Place a small stool under your feet to lift your knees higher than your hips. This can help you sit tall and take pressure off of your lower back.

, If your baby is fussy while breastfeeding, they may be uncomfortable. Signs of this include pulling off and on your breast and wiggling. If you notice fussiness or other behaviors that may indicate discomfort, check that your baby is on their side and in proper alignment. You may even need to prop up your baby with an extra pillow.Burp your baby if they continue to be fussy after you’ve checked and made changes to their position.

, If you are still having problems with getting a good latch, you may want to see a lactation consultant. This person can give you tips and guidance on how best to nurse your baby.Ask your medical professional or another person for a recommendation. You can also call the National Breastfeeding Helpline at (1) 800-994-9662."

Give your body time.",How to Diet While Breastfeeding," You won't have to force the dieting in order to shed those post baby pounds. Breastfeeding naturally burns calories (about 500 a day)and much of the weight will go away naturally as your body shrinks. Even your lactating breasts can add a couple pounds, so don't worry too much about dieting. Losing those 30 pounds will be easier than you think. This article will discuss healthy ways to keep you from putting on any more weight (and possibly even lose a small amount of weight), but in general you should wait until after you stop breastfeeding to start dieting.


For example, let’s say you normally ate about 2000 calories a day, pre-baby. During pregnancy, you gained 35 pounds. Now, you’ll lose about 9-10 pounds just by giving birth.You’ll lose another several pounds as your body naturally shrinks down and puts itself back together. Now for the rest of those pounds, right? A diet would normally involve cutting your calories intake by about 500 calories, which your body is already doing by making breast milk. Simply by feeding yourself a healthy diet and breastfeeding your baby, you will lose all of the baby weight in just a few months.
The fact of the matter is that you’re supposed to eat more and be a little rounder when you’re pregnant and for a while after you have your baby. This is normal and healthy! By trying to get thin again so soon after your baby is born, you put yourself at risk. You may also be putting your child at risk, if your dieting choices lead you to an unhealthy diet.;
, The diets that you normally consider when you think of dieting are largely going to hurt you and your baby. This is especially true of any diet which limits your food groups. You need to a widely varied diet in order to get the nutrients that your baby needs and keep your own body healthy. As a general rule, you want to eat healthy and exercise during this time, not do anything that that promises to drop X pounds in Y days.


Atkins, South Beach, and any diet that goes very heavy on the protein and fish (like the Mediterranean diet or the Zone diet) can pose a problem for your health.

, You will find websites that tell you not to count calories at all, but that advice is a little too black-and-white. What you definitely shouldn’t do is listen to some specific number of calories you should be having in a day. However, if you tailor your calorie count to your age, body, and activity level, then you can help make sure that you won’t gain any more weight. Done carefully and slowly, you can even begin to lose a little weight by getting slightly fewer calories than you need.


You can find a number of calorie calculators online. The best method, however, is to talk to a registered professional who can help you calculate the right number for your body.
Keep in mind that breastfeeding naturally burns 500 calories a day. If you’re eating healthy and at the same level you did before your pregnancy, you should lower your weight naturally over time.

, Eating a widely varied, healthy diet is the best thing that you can do both for your own body and for your baby. Your baby is growing very quickly at this time (growing almost 1” a month and gaining more than 50% of its birth weight every week!), so it will need lots of nutrients in order to do that. What you don’t provide by eating a healthy diet, your body will forcibly pull from its stores (which can have a harmful affect on your health). You’ll want to make sure to cover all of the food groups, getting the right amounts of protein, grains, fruits, and vegetables for your body. Generally, 50% of your food should be fruits and veggies (mostly veggies), with the remaining half of your food being roughly split between grains and protein.Food actually changes the taste of your breast milk, so eating a highly varied diet may also make your baby a better eater down the line. , There are also, of course, lots of things you’re not supposed to have while breastfeeding. The least dangerous are parsley and mint, which will just make you stop producing milk, and the most dangerous are alcohol and many medications, which can damage your baby’s body. You should also avoid caffeine, which includes coffee, soda, and chocolate, and black teas, since your baby’s body cannot break it down yet.


After your baby reaches 3 months, it will become easier to digest the caffeine and you may be able to have small amounts.Some women pump their milk ahead of time so that they can fit in one night of drinking or other of these dangerous substances. This can be okay as long as you do it smartly and infrequently, but keep in mind that some trace amounts of these substances can remain in your milk for awhile and you might still be putting your child at risk.

, Some foods cause problems for some people and don’t cause problems for others. It is not that these foods are necessarily dangerous (like alcohol); they might be hard for your particular baby to digest, making diapers a bit more interesting for a while and giving you a cranky baby to deal with. Foods that you can experiment with, but might want to avoid, include:


Citrus, which bothers some babies’ tummies. You’ll have to be really careful about getting Vitamin C if you cut citrus, however.
Broccoli and garlic, which affect the taste of breast milk. These strong flavors will end up in your milk, which might make baby turn away from the breast at first. They should get over it, though, when they get hungry enough.
Spicy foods. Painful for you, painful for them.
Common allergens (milk, peanuts, etc.), Empty calories are calories which contain little or no significant nutrients.Empty calories will provide nothing to you or your baby and only lead you to gain more weight. Because of this, if you are trying to lose that post baby weight then you are really going to want to avoid empty calories.


Empty calories are generally associated with sugars and solid fats.
Examples of common sources of empty calories are ice cream, cookies, soda, cheap juices, cake, pizza, cheese, and butter.
Occasional indulgences, such as for a birthday celebration, are okay but these should not hold a common place in your diet.

, Many people eat too much food when they do eat. Eating smaller amounts of food at one time can help you stick to a reasonable calorie count. To get yourself eating better portions of food, try using a side or salad plate to eat your meal. Come back for seconds only if you are still hungry after 15 minutes.


A good rule of thumb is that if you’re eating as much as you would in a restaurant, you might be eating too much.
You’ll also need to learn to recognize when you’re really full. Remember: you don’t want to feel stuffed. You just want to feel not-hungry.

, Waiting for your food to begin to digest can help you to realize when you’re really full. This is great for preventing over-eating and even more post-baby weight gain. Give your body 15 minutes after eating a small meal and then go back for (a smaller portion of) seconds if you’re still hungry or top it off with healthy snacks, like broccoli.

, Another technique is to eat micro meals, or basically really healthy snacks, and skip the standard “two big meals” altogether.By eating small amounts of food throughout the day, you can feel more full and energetic. This is also easier on a new mom, since finding time to cook and eat can be really tough.


A sample daily diet would look like a bowl of oatmeal, a banana, and a protein shake when you wake up, celery sticks on your way to work, a cup of yogurt and two pieces of whole grain toast at 10, a turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomato at 12, grapes and orange slices at 2, carrot sticks and a glass of milk at 4, and a big kale salad with a side of quinoa for dinner. Eat soy nuts between any of these “meals” if you really can’t fight off the munchies!

, As your baby weans, you’ll be burning fewer calories. This means that your body will probably try to tell you that it is less hungry. This is a good thing! You should listen to your body and ease up on your calorie intake. It is also an indication that you’re ready to start dieting and exercising properly, since you won’t have to worry as much about your little one any more.

, You might find wildly different advice on what breastfeeding moms should and shouldn’t eat, and this is largely because cultural differences play a huge part. The most important thing is that you eat a nutrient-rich, varied diet. Scientifically, this is all you and your baby need.


For example, American moms are told never to eat garlic because it will make your baby refuse to drink, while moms in India are encouraged to eat garlic because it gets baby used to adult flavors and contains lots of great nutrients.
Certainly, if one particular type of food seems to make your baby turn away from the breast for too long or gives the stomach problems, stop eating that food. But don’t let your mom-friends scare you away from half the food at the grocery store. Babies will often get used to strong or unusual tastes over time, so don’t worry if they refuse for a day or so.

, The one thing that biology says you will need is more calcium.You’re making milk, after all. If you don’t get enough calcium for you and your baby, then your body will start breaking down any calcium it can find. This means calcium-low moms end up with depleted, weaker bones, which is not what you want. Take a supplement and try to fit more calcium-rich foods into your diet.


The healthiest sources of calcium actually aren’t milk or dairy products, which are high in unhealthy fats. Instead, good sources of calcium for nursing moms include white beans, kale, and bok choy.
1000-1300 mg of calcium a day is recommended for breastfeeding moms.

, It’s a fact that the type of fat that you get in your diet also ends up in your breast milk.While it’s not the biggest concern, it certainly won’t hurt to make sure baby gets the healthiest fats and cholesterol possible. This means that you’ll want to eat foods rich in healthy fats, like sardines, avocado, olive oil, and soy.


Bad sources of fats include butter, cheese, pork, and most of the usual “junk foods” (chips, cookies, etc).

, Getting enough water is important no matter what, but do keep in mind that you’re making several ounces of extra fluid every day now! That means you’re probably going to need more water than you’re already taking in. Make sure you get enough to help keep your milk flowing and keep your body healthy as well.


It is recommended that breastfeeding moms get 16 cups of fluid a day, though your body may need more or need less. Now, how much is “enough” really depends on your body. There’s no good number to point to. Your best bet is to drink until your urine is pale, as this is usually an indicator of healthy fluid intake.
You can technically get water by drinking juices, milk, soda, and other fluids, but those are high in empty calories like sugar (defeating the purpose of your goal to lose weight).

, If you have dietary restrictions (vegan/vegetarian, celiac disease, etc), the you’ll need to supplement your diet to make sure that you and your baby get the right amount of nutrients. The big concern for vegans (and to a lesser extend, vegetarians) is getting enough B12, calcium, and zinc. Those with celiac disease will need to make sure to compensate for nutrients normally lacking in their diet.


Fortified breakfast cereals are actually your best bet for B12.
Calcium is also easy to source from vegetables. Collard greens, turnips, and garlic are good sources.
Talk to a dietician if you have other food restrictions, to determine what nutrients you might be low in and what safe alternatives are so that you can stay healthy.

, Maximizing the nutritional content of the food you do eat will allow you to keep your baby and body healthy while minimizing your own hunger and developing habits that will make shedding pounds later a breeze. To get the most bang out of your foods, try:


Kiwis (more Vitamin C than oranges!), bananas, and pomegranates
Kale, broccoli, spinach, brussels sprouts, and shiitake mushrooms
Wild-caught Alaskan salmon, sardines, anchovies, white-meat poultry, white beans, and soy.
Quinoa, Barley, Oatmeal, and brown rice, If you really want to take your diet and health seriously while you breastfeed, it would be a good idea to talk to a professional, who can tailor their advice to your own personal health profile and dietary needs. There are a couple of different professionals that can all give you great advice:


Lactation consultant
Dietitian
Doctor

, There are lots of small ways you can get active throughout your day. These small activities can burn calories and help you get on your way to shedding those pregnancy pounds. Adding more activity into your daily schedule can also help you start shedding those pounds. Try to find time in between your normal activities to fit in at least 10 minutes of exercise. That’s all it takes! Ten minutes, three times a day, and you can make sure you’re maintaining a healthy weight and keeping your body in shape. You can do things like:


Squats at the stove while you wait for dinner to cook.
A jog around the parking lot at lunch.
An extra trip (or couple of trips) up and down the stairs before work.
Good examples of little ways to be more active include taking the stairs instead of the elevator, using a standing or treadmill desk, or sitting on an exercise ball instead of a chair.

, If you’re having trouble finding time for exercise, find a way to work your baby into your routine. Playtime can become workout time! There are specially-designed workout routines that incorporate your baby, but you can also use less structured means as well.


Use a baby wrap to hold your child and then do squats, lunges, and other similar motions. This will have the added benefit of being fun and soothing for your baby.
You can also use your baby as a weight and lift them up and down to build strength in your arms. You’ll need this because they’ll be toddler-sized before you know it!

, If your body is having a hard time recovering from giving birth or if you had to have a C-section, you might want to start with gentle exercises until your muscles build up strength again.


Swimming, walking, and tai chi are good examples. You can also take your baby for a walk! Put them in a carrier your chest (which has them facing you) to burn even more calories.
Talk to your doctor about what activities are and aren’t a good idea if you’ve had a C-section. Everyone will be at a different point in your healing process so specific advice is complicated.

, If you’re really low on time for exercise, make sure you’re using the most efficient, high impact exercises that you can. These will have a greater effect with a shorter amount of time invested in doing the, making them easier to fit into those three 10 minute sessions a day.



Squats, planks, and burpees are good examples.

, The most important thing to remember is that to lose weight in a healthy way, you need to lose it gradually. Your body is going to need time anyway, in order to shrink naturally back down. Plan on maintaining your weight and building good habits and lifestyle changes while you breastfeed. When your child is weaned, you can then use those habits to lose the weight over the course of a few months or a year.


Most moms return to their pre-birth weight after about 3 months to 1 year. Some take much longer and some moms never lose the weight. Remember that your weight doesn't really matter all that much. What matters is that you feel healthy and ready to take on a wonderful, active life with your new child.

Make your face entertaining.,
Wiggle the baby’s limbs.,
Offer interesting things to look at.,
Find a noisemaker.,
Sing songs with your baby.",How to Keep a Baby Entertained1," Your baby will be delighted by your funny faces, and may try to imitate you if she can. Making funny sounds, sticking out your tongue, or twisting your face into a funny shape will be entertaining for a baby.Babies love to be talked to and have their attention focused on you.
You are likely your newborn baby’s favorite toy.;
, A baby can be entertained by his own body, if you help him. Try laying the baby on his back, and help him clap his hands together gently. You can also hold his feet and pedal his feet back and forth as if riding a bicycle.Talk or sing with your baby while you’re wiggling his body, or make funny faces.
Try pressing your lips against the baby’s skin and blowing. This will make an entertaining sound and sensation for the baby.

, Keeping toys and mobiles with strongly contrasting colors (black, red, white) will help keep a baby’s attention and stimulate his developing sense of vision. Brightly colored pictures, contrasting patterns, and things that move are entertaining for a baby to look at.The newborn baby’s visual sense is still developing, and he’s able to best focus on things 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) from his face. Farther away, his vision will be blurry.
You can also hold an object in front of your baby’s face, and slowly move it back and forth. The baby’s gaze will likely follow the object happily.
Babies enjoy looking at themselves, so you can offer a mirror for the baby to gaze at her own reflection. Choose one for children, which are made from durable and safe materials, rather than glass.
Remember that your face is also an “interesting object” for your baby, and will be one of your newborn’s favorite toys.

, Most babies love to explore sounds. For example, get a set of plastic keys and jingle them in front of the baby. A baby is easily entertained by something like this. If you can’t find a set of keys, try a toy that shakes or rattles.Other noisemakers include plastic rattles, maracas, or homemade rattles that you make yourself out of a tupperware container filled with dried rice or beans. Make sure your container is closed tightly so that no choking hazards are released.
Allow your newborn to close his fingers around a rattle, and he’ll slowly start to connect his body motion with the rattling sound.

, Your voice will be the most soothing sound for your baby early on. Babies and infants love repetition too, so making little musical sounds over and over will be very entertaining. For example, repeat the baby’s name in a “sing-songy” voice, pitching your voice first high, then low.Rocking your baby as you sing will make the activity more engaging for the baby.
Whatever you sing frequently to your baby will help soothe and entertain him during fussy times.
If you know how to sing traditional childhood lullabies, you’ll be more entertained, but know that babies will be happy to hear your voice singing or humming anything.
Your baby may not have the physical coordination necessary to play early childhood games like ""Itsy Bitsy Spider,” but she will likely enjoy your singing and silly facial expressions.

Give the dog attention while the baby is awake.,
Maintain the dog's usual schedule as much as possible.,
Create space for positive interactions.",How to Introduce Your Baby to Your Dog," Make sure that the dog understands basic commands such as “No,” “Sit,” “Stay,” and “Quiet.” These commands will help you better control interactions between your dog and your child, so be sure to start training well before the baby arrives.Consider enrolling in a training course with your dog. Basic training courses can teach your dog simple commands and self-discipline, and are often offered through pet stores, animal shelters, and private trainers.
If you do not have the time or ability to take your dog in for training, you may also be able to send them to a private trainer. This generally comes at a greater cost, but some trainers will work with your dog directly instead of requiring you to take a class.;
, Give your dog a place inside the house that is completely dedicated to them. It should be somewhere outside of areas dedicated to the baby, but close enough to the family that your dog still feels included, such as a large crate or a corner of the kitchen or living room.Place your dog’s bed, food, and water dishes in their designated area, along with comfort objects such as toys, blankets, and pillows.
When your dog acts nervous or rambunctious about changes around the home or your new routine, gently escort them to their safe area and help them get calm and comfortable.

, If you do not want your dog to enter a specific room such as the baby's room, teach them that it is a restricted area. Gently block entryways with your body and provide a firm but not angry command such as “No,” or “Wrong.”A good alternative is to set up a baby gate in the door of the baby's room. This allows your dog to see what's happening without entering the room. Baby gates are easily purchased at most baby stores, pet stores, and department stores, as well as online.

, Bringing a new baby into the home will likely shift your schedule and your ability to pay attention to your dog. Try varying your routine to help your dog become accustomed to a less-predictable schedule.Try taking naps in the afternoon to mimic the irregular times you might sleep. You can also create a more variable feeding schedule by switching the time you feed the dog by an hour or so each night.
Focus on providing longer periods of uninterrupted attention, such as walks or trips to the dog park, instead of small bursts of attention throughout the day.
Avoid the temptation to give your dog extra attention in the days before the baby arrives. This may reinforce the concept that you are able to spend more time with your dog than you can reasonably give once the baby arrives.

, One to three months before the due date, invest in a convincing baby doll that looks and sounds like a real baby. Allow the dog to sniff the doll and teach them to stay back when you change it, bathe it or feed it.Reward your dog with treats, praise, and physical affection for good behavior, but try to avoid punishing them for negative behavior.
If a dog reacts with negative behavior to a situation, give them a command such as “No,” or “Wrong,” and repeat the situation until your dog’s actions improve.
Don't leave the doll lying around anywhere that the dog could grab it or chew it. Treat the doll as you would a real baby, so the dog learns to respect it and knows that it is not a toy.

, While your baby won’t touch the dog much early on, eventually they may grab at your dog. To avoid a defensive reaction, introduce new forms of touch by gently petting the dog in places the baby is likely to grab such as the tail, paws, mouth area, ears, and inside the ears.Try this multiple times a day for a few minutes at a time.
Practice these touches when your dog is engaged in their favorite activity, such as playing or eating, so that they learn to connect this type of touch with something pleasant.

, Before you bring the baby into the house, allow your dog to adjust to some of the new odors that will come with the baby. Help your dog by wearing baby oil and baby powder on your skin, and by allowing your dog to sniff items such as the baby’s blanket or clothing.Dogs are very sensitive to smells, and an unfamiliar smell can seem like a threat. Helping them adjust to new scents will help them relax once the baby is home.

, If your dog is having trouble adjusting to a new routine, or if they have a history of less-than-ideal reactions to children, consider working with a dog behaviorist to help your dog create lasting behavioral changes. A behaviorist goes beyond what a trainer can offer, and can help you work with your dog to create a safe and loving home for your baby.If the dog cannot learn to behave in an obedient, safe manner around children, you will need to take more extreme measures, like keeping your dog in a penned off area, or considering rehoming them with a friend or family member. At this point, the safety of your baby should be your top priority.

, Schedule a grooming appointment a week or so before the baby is due. Have the groomer bathe and brush your dog’s coat, brush your dog’s teeth, and trim your dog’s nails.Regular nail trims will become a necessity once the baby arrives. Talk to your groomer about the best nail-trimming products for at-home use, and see if they would be willing to offer you a quick lesson on how to cut your dog’s nails safely at home.
If you or your partner are too busy to take the dogs in to visit the groomers, yourself, ask a friend or a family member to drop off and pick up your pup.

, As best as you are able, try to schedule a vet appointment a week or so before the baby is due. Work with the vet to ensure all of your dog’s shots are up to date and that your dog is in good physical health.


Making sure your dog is clean and healthy before the baby arrives will help keep your home environment clean and healthy once the baby comes. It will also reduce the number of accidents your dog can cause when first interacting with your baby.

, Have someone that the dog knows and trusts, such as a spouse or friend, enter the house before the baby. Allow them to greet and play with the new dog before bringing the baby into the house.Put on your dog’s leash and harness or collar before bringing in the baby. If your dog is used to wearing a head harness, it may also be beneficial at this time.
You may want to have someone take the dog out for a walk while you bring in the baby so that your dog is less territorial about letting something new into the house.

, Start with a short interaction as the baby enters the house. Have separate people holding the baby and the dog. Allow the dog to come close enough to the baby to sniff but not close enough to make contact.Allow your dog to sniff the area around the baby for a few minutes, then have the dog go to their safe space while you get the baby into its room or crib.
Limit the amount the baby and the dog interact for the first few days. A few minutes a few times a day will help your dog adjust without creating too much confusion.

, Watch your dog's body language carefully for signs that they are uncomfortable or threatened. Keep the baby far enough away that the dog cannot easily nip at them, and watch for signs including bristled fur, set-back ears, bearing teeth, tail between the legs, or their body going rigid.If you notice that the dog is feeling threatened, have someone hold the dog in place while the baby is moved to their room. Once the baby is safe, guide the dog to their safe space and leave them alone to calm down.
Reward positive interactions with praise and treats, but try not to punish confused or excited behavior, such as barking or jumping, as long it is not an immediate threat to the baby.

, While you will probably have the most time for your dog when the baby is asleep, it is also important to offer the dog attention while the baby is awake. This keeps the dog active in your family life, and helps prevent jealousy or possessiveness.


If you feed your baby at a certain time, feed the dog at the same time, talk to the dog while carrying the baby around and bring the dog and the baby for a walk together.

, The times at which you do things may change, but provide the dog with as much consistency as you can offer. Make sure they get the same number of walks, bathroom breaks, and meals every day, even if they are not at exactly the same times.If you are struggling to keep a basic schedule, consider hiring a dog walker to come over once a day to feed, walk, and provide a bathroom break for your pet.
You may also consider dropping your dog off at a doggie day care once or twice a week to allow them to run around and socialize with other dogs.

, Teach the dog to give you space while you take care of the baby by keeping it out of the baby’s room or setting the dog up in its safe space. Then, when both the baby and the dog’s needs have been cared for, allow time each day for the two of them to quietly and calmly interact.Allow the dog to sit or sleep next to you while you hold the baby. Keep interactions loving and calm initially so that the dog is reacting to the baby rather than new smells or sounds.
If the dog becomes too nervous or excited, send them to their safe space and try again later.

Decide when to introduce the stuffed animal or lovey.,
Keep the stuffed animal or lovey close to you.,
Engage with your baby and their stuffed animal.,
Follow your baby's lead.,
Avoid putting stuffed animals in your baby's crib.",How to Introduce Stuffed Animals to Your Baby1," Consider presenting the item to your baby when they're around 6 months old. This is when your baby is starting to really develop social skills and might form an attachment. You may notice your baby making more eye contact with people or becoming a bit clingier. These are signs that your baby might like having their own stuffed animal or comfort item.You might find that your baby has already chosen a favorite stuffed animal or comfort item at an early age, although it's rare for newborns to attach to an object.;
, To help your baby accept the stuffed animal or attach to the comfort item, consider keeping it close to you before you offer it. This way, it will smell like you, which will comfort your baby. To impart your scent on the stuffed animal or comfort item, you can:Sleep with it the night before you give it to your baby
Keep it next to you as you snuggle with your baby
Hold it against you while you nurse or feed your baby

, Offer the stuffed animal to your baby and give them a chance to check it out. If your child seems disinterested in it, play peekaboo with it or talk to the stuffed animal. Your baby might become curious about the stuffed animal and begin showing an interest.You could also snuggle with the stuffed animal and your baby when you read together or just cuddle.

, Your baby might love the new comfort item. But if your baby doesn't show much interest, don't force them to connect. Some babies want a comfort item or stuffed animal while other babies don't pay them much attention. Just let your baby decide what they want. They may end up choosing a different stuffed animal or might wait a few months before becoming attached to one.Some babies that self-soothe might not want a comfort item or stuffed animal. These babies may prefer rubbing their hands through their hair or sucking a thumb or pacifier.

, Practice safe sleep habits by waiting until your baby is at least 12 months old before leaving stuffed animals in their crib. You should also avoid letting them sleep with any soft loveys, blankets, or bumpers, since these could increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), suffocation, or strangulation.Don't forget to remove any pillows or soft crib bumpers as well. Wait to introduce pillows until your baby is at least 2 years old.

Play “Peek-a-Boo” to teach object permanence.,
Read a book together.,
Encourage playing with food.,
Play with soap foam.,
Make a water table.,
Give the baby some pots and pans.",How to Keep a Baby Entertained2," Babies aren’t born with the idea of object permanence; that is, something still exists even though it can’t be seen. That means that for a baby, when you are in another room, you might never come back. Understandably, this is scary for a baby! You can start to teach your baby the idea that things continue to exist even when the baby can’t see them by playing “Peek-a-Boo.” Most babies love to play ""Peek-a-Boo"" with their caregiver, starting at the age of about 4 months.Whether you play “Peek-a-Boo” with your hands covering your face, with a blanket, or with something else (such as a towel or a scarf), is less important than the routine of covering your face and then uncovering it.
Playing “Peek-a-Boo” teaches your baby not to be anxious because you’ll come back, no matter what.
You can teach older babies to lift the blanket up and down himself/herself.

, Even though your baby might be a long way from learning to read for himself, he will enjoy hearing your voice and developing the language part of his brain. Try using different voices, tones, pitches, gruffness, and accents to make it more entertaining. Point at and name each thing on a page.Babies tend to love repetition, so don’t be afraid of reading a book too frequently.
As your baby gets older, start to encourage him to turn the pages of the book on his own. Thicker pages will help support his fine motor coordination.

, Once a child is around 6 months old, you might try playing with food. Food can be an entertaining activity even when not at meal times. Place the baby in a high chair with a secure tray. You’ll want to stay close by, but a high chair will provide a safe place for your baby to be while she entertains herself. For example, put a few spoonfuls of yogurt directly on the high chair tray makes for fun “finger painting” for a baby.You can put ice cubes onto her tray to play with as they melt. Make sure you take the ice cubes away by the time they get small enough to put into her mouth.
Playing with rice or pasta noodles makes for good fun as well.
Non-food toys at a high chair might include the metal rings from canning jars, which can be chewed, stacked, banged or rolled around on her tray. Just be sure there are no sharp edges on items you give to your baby.
A baby might also enjoy playing with utensils such as wooden spoons, rubber spatulas, or silicone brushes.

, If your baby doesn’t like to put new things into her mouth, soap foam can be a great toy to play with. To make nontoxic soap foam, you can a few tablespoons of water to ¼ cup of nontoxic liquid bath soap (such as Babyganics foaming dish and bottle soap), and then mix these ingredients with a hand mixer. You’ll quickly have a bowlful of soft foam for a baby to play with.You can also use shaving foam for this kind of play, but some babies don’t care for the smell.
Put the baby and the foam on a towel or another soft surface for easy cleanup.
This is another activity that could easily be done in the high chair.

, Because a lot of a baby’s entertainment comes from sensory exploration, water tables make for wonderful entertainment. A childcare center might have a professionally-made water table, but at home you can make a water table simply by putting a sturdy, shallow tray of warm water on the high chair tray.You’ll want to make sure that the water tray isn’t likely to be pushed off the high chair tray.
Try making the water more interesting by adding a few drops of food coloring.
If playing with toys at the water table is more interesting than simply splashing at the water with her hands, bring in some bath toys.
Never leave a baby alone when playing with water or in a bathtub, even if the water is shallow.

, If you’re in the kitchen, it will be easy to provide ordinary household items like pots, spoons, plastic containers, empty boxes, etc. for your baby’s entertainment. If the baby is older, he’ll be be interested in exploring the items, seeing what they sound like when they’re banged against the floor or each other. Younger babies may be more interested in learning what they smell and taste like.You’ll want to make sure that the items are clean enough to be put into your baby’s mouth.
Make sure you never give your baby anything that he can break, or which might have small parts that could present a choking hazard.

"
Look for stuffed animals filled with cotton or acrylic.,
Choose stuffed animals or loveys that aren't choking hazards.,
Consider how you'll clean the stuffed animal or lovey.,
Regularly check for signs of wear.,
Think about buying multiple stuffed animals or comfort items.",How to Introduce Stuffed Animals to Your Baby2," Parents and caregivers have more choices than ever when it comes to stuffed animals. Select a high-quality stuffed animal, since it may be with your baby for years. You should pick one that's filled with cotton or acrylic batting (stuffing) because these won't be hazardous if the stuffed animal tears.Avoid stuffed animals filled with beans or plastic beads. These could be choking hazards if they spill out through a hole or tear.

, Look over the stuffed animal or comfort item to ensure there's nothing that could come loose and become a choking hazard. For example, avoid stuffed animals with small buttons that could be pulled off, ribbons, or small plastic parts.You should also choose a stuffed animal or comfort item that's small. This will make it easier for your growing baby to eventually toddle around with it.

, Read the care information for the stuffed animal or lovey before you buy it. If it looks like it can't be simply cleaned or washed at home, you may want to choose something else. If your child attaches to it, you'll need to wash it occasionally. When in doubt, you can put the item inside a pillowcase and tie it shut. Toss it in a gentle wash cycle and tumble dry it on low.Putting the item in the pillow case will prevent it from being thrown about too much as it washes and dries.

, If your baby attaches to a stuffed animal or lovey, the item might become worn. In addition to washing it frequently, you'll need to check it every few weeks for any needed repairs or safety concerns. Mend the stuffed animal before you give it back to your child.


For example, you may see holes forming and stuffing falling out. You can sew the stuffed animal shut or take it to someone who can mend it for you.
If the item is too worn to repair and is hazardous to your baby, you'll need to replace it.

, Once your child has attached to a stuffed animal or lovey, you may want to go back to the store and purchase more of them. Having more than one of the same stuffed animal or item can come in handy if you ever lose it or it simply wears out.Keep in mind that some small children won't accept a replacement, even if it is the same stuffed animal (just newer). Your child might want to attach to something else.

Find a suitable pool.,
Make sure lifeguards or instructors are available.,
Hold your baby tightly.,
Supervise your baby.,
Avoid relying on flotation devices.,
Play with your baby.,
Let the baby splash on the steps.,
Avoid staying too long.,
Remove the baby if they are upset.",How to Introduce a Baby to a Pool," Before you introduce your baby to the pool, you can familiarize them with water through baths. While they bathe, fill a cup with water and slowly pour it over their head. This will teach your child what it is like to be wet. Always supervise your child while they are in the bath., The earlier you expose your baby to the pool, the more confident they will be as a toddler in the water. You can start as young as six weeks old. Do not worry about introducing them too young. Babies up to six months old actually have a natural instinct to hold their breath under water. For young infants, you should make sure that umbilical cord or circumcision wounds have healed.Furthermore, if you had a C-section, you may want to wait until you have healed as well.You can wait until your baby is older if you want. Babies between six and ten months can be taught to hold their breath on cue. They may also be able to grab the edge of the pool or push off the side of the pool into your arms.Speak to your doctor to make sure that your baby is ready to go into the pool. The doctor can tell you if an infant's wounds have healed or if there are any medical conditions that may prevent your baby from going into the water.
Also avoid bringing your baby to a public pool if they have any infections such as skin, respiratory, or gastrointestinal.

, You will need to pack your diaper bag with certain supplies to make sure that your baby is comfortable and happy. The most important thing to bring are swim diapers. These will catch any accidents that happen in the pool. Many public pools require that babies wear swim diapers. You should also bring:A bottle or snacks if your baby is at that stage
A clean towel or two — one with a hood is best
Bath toys such as toy boats, plastic animals, or dolls

, You can start in a public pool, a private pool, or an inflatable baby pool. The pool should be warm and clean. For babies under six months, the water should be heated to 90°F (32°C).If you cannot find a heated pool, you can take them into a non-heated pool. Your pool session should only last 10 minutes. Afterwards, warm the baby up in a clean towel.If the pool feels too cold for you, it is too cold for your baby.

, If you are using a public pool, you should ensure that there are lifeguards on duty. If something bad happens, they can help rescue or resuscitate your baby.


You may even want to consider baby swimming lessons. The instructors will be experienced in introducing babies to pools, and they will have proper safety equipment., Enter the pool with your baby pressed against your chest. Go slowly so that you do not shock your baby. Once you are in the water, hold your baby under the armpits. Make sure their head is above water and that their face is level with yours., You should always be holding your baby in the pool, even if they are just playing on the steps. Never take your eyes off of them.Even if you are starting in a shallow baby pool, always watch your baby. If they fall over, they can inhale water and drown. Sit in the pool next to them or on the steps with them between your legs., Water wings, air-filled tubes, and kick boards will not guarantee that your baby will be safe. Some experts recommend against using these as they may cause more harm than good.Instead, keep a firm grip on your child while they are in the pool. If you want extra reassurance, find a U.S. Coast Guard approved baby life vest., Once you and the baby are in the water, you should start playing and singing to them. Smile and relax. This will help your baby adjust to the water, and they will associate it with pleasant emotions.You can try to:


Gently bob your baby up and down in the water.
Gently swirl them back and forth in the water.
Float some bath toys in the water. As they reach for them, hold your baby out horizontally in front of you as though they are swimming. Do not let go of them. Make sure that their head is above water.

, If there are steps in the pool, you can sit down with your baby sitting between your legs. Keep the baby upright. They can splash in the water or play with bath toys.

, Babies can become cold in the pool, even in a heated pool. At first, you should only have a session of about 10 to 20 minutes. You can work your swimming sessions up to 30 minutes, but this is the maximum time limit for most babies.


If you notice your baby’s lips or fingernails becoming blue, they are cold. Similarly, if they begin to shiver, you should remove them from the pool. Dry them in a towel to warm them., If the baby cries or shows other signs of distress, get out of the water and try again later. Wrap them in a towel to dry them off. You may want to wait a few weeks before trying to introduce them again."

Tighten the esophageal sphincter with surgery.",How to Treat Acid Reflux in Newborns," Watch your baby to see if she exhibits symptoms of acid reflux before making lifestyle changes. Typical signs of acid reflux in newborns are:


Spitting up and vomiting
Refusing to eat
Having difficulty eating or swallowing
Being irritable during feedings
Burping or hiccuping wet liquid
Failing to gain weight.;
, Try changing the ways you feed your baby with a bottle. These may help relieve or prevent acid reflux in your newborn.Increase the frequency of your baby’s feedings but reduce how much you give him at each feeding so that there is less pressure on the muscle that keeps food from refluxing.Make sure your baby’s bottle and nipple is the right size. This allows your baby to get the right amount of milk from the nipple without swallowing air.Try a different brand of formula, but only after discussing it with your baby's doctor.Thicken the formula with some rice cereal with your pediatrician’s approval and directions., Babies who are breastfed may experience slightly less reflux because breastmilk is digested faster than formula.Similar to bottle feeding, changing your breastfeeding technique may help treat your newborn’s reflux.


Reduce the amount of milk in your baby’s stomach by breastfeeding for less time each feeding, but more frequently throughout the day.Eliminate different foods from your diet to see if this eases your newborns reflux.For example, you may want to avoid dairy, beef, or eggs to see one of these causes the reflux.Thicken expressed breast milk with rice cereal in small increments., Interrupt your baby’s feedings to burp her.More frequent burping may relieve pressure in her belly and prevent reflux. Use the following schedule as a guideline for burping:


Avoid feedings two hours before bedtime if possible.
Burp your baby every one to two hours after a feeding to help relieve gas and prevent reflux.
Interrupt bottle feedings every one to two ounces.
Burp breastfed babies whenever they pull off of your nipple., Keeping your baby in an upright position can help relieve and prevent reflux because gravity keeps the contents of his stomach down. Make sure to keep him upright for 20–30 minutes after you feed him.Place your baby on your lap with his head resting on your chest.Try and keep your baby quiet while holding him upright., Doctors recommend that babies sleep on their backs to minimize the risk of sudden infant death syndrome;however, this position may cause problems for babies with moderate to severe reflux and your doctor may suggest putting your baby to sleep on her side or stomach, but this is rarely recommended.Make sure to speak with your baby’s doctor before changing her sleeping position.
Place your baby in her crib on a firm mattress with no blankets, bumpers, or stuffed animals that might suffocate her. Gently turn her head to the side so that her mouth and nose aren’t obstructed.Consider elevating the mattress slightly with a foam block or wedge pillow under the head of the mattress.Avoid using a pillow on the mattress, which could suffocate your baby. If you elevate the head of the bed, you can often continue to put your baby to bed on her back, which is usually the safest.
Put your baby on her left side, which keeps the stomach inlet higher than the outlet, and may help keep food down., There are natural products called “gripe water” that many people use to soothe reflux and colic. There is no scientific evidence that gripe water is effective, but try it after consulting with your doctor.Be aware that the World Health Organization doesn’t recommend giving gripe water to babies under six months.Make sure to speak to your doctor before giving your baby gripe water.Look for products with fennel, peppermint, lemon balm, chamomile, or ginger.Stay away from products with sodium bicarbonate, sucrose, fructose, or alcohol., If making lifestyle changes doesn’t ease your newborn’s reflux or his symptoms get worse, schedule and appointment with his pediatrician.You should also see your baby’s pediatrician if he has the following symptoms:Inability to gain weight
Projectile vomiting
Vomit or spit up that is green or yellow
Vomit or spit up that contains blood or material that looks like coffee grounds
Refusal to eat
Stools that are bloody
Chronic cough or difficulty breathing
Irritability after eating

, Your baby’s pediatrician will examine her and ask you questions about her symptoms. Depending on her She also may recommend further testing to confirm a diagnosis of acid reflux. Your doctor may order one of the following tests:


Ultrasound
Blood or urine tests
Esophageal pH monitoring
X-rays
Upper endoscopy., Depending on the outcome of your doctor’s visit and possible testing, your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes and/or prescribe medication.Be aware that reflux medications aren’t generally recommended for babies with uncomplicated reflux as they could rarely cause health problems or prevent nutrient absorption.Follow your doctor’s dosing instructions. Most medications given to babies for reflux are dosed specifically for them.Give your baby drugs to reduce the acid. She’ll likely get either a proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole (Prilosec or Prevacid) or an H2 blockers like Tagamet or Zantac.Avoid giving over-the-counter acid blocking drugs to your baby.

, In very rare cases, some babies may need surgery to tighten the muscle that blocks food from coming back up.The procedure, called fundoplication, is generally only done on babies that have severe breathing problems with their reflux."

Keep things clean and dry as much as possible.Wash off your baby's bottom with warm water.,
Let the baby air dry.,
Apply diaper cream.,
Know why your child got diaper rash in the first place.,
Know if you should see a doctor.,
Prevent it from recurring.,
If all else fails, try a home remedy.",How to Treat Diaper Rash," Resist the temptation to wipe the area if possible. A bulb syringe can be used to spray water to the sensitive spots. Gently remove any remaining poop with a dab of a baby wipe or wet cloth.


If you do use a baby wipe, don't use one with any alcohol or fragrance.
Diaper rash is a common kind of contact dermatitis where the skin gets inflamed due to prolonged contact of urine and fecal matter on the skin of the baby. If not caught early it may become infected by bacteria or yeast. Avoidance of irritants and frequent diaper changes are -- hands down -- the best preventive measures.;
, If you must towel dry, dab gently. Don't rub! That'll just irritate the skin further. Consider the following options:


Place a new diaper on your baby, but place it loosely (or use one that's too big).
Keep your baby in the buff for even just a few minutes. The more time she can air out, the better.
Consider having your baby sleep diaper free, too. You can put down a protective sheet on your baby's crib to keep from having to deal with disasters in the wee hours of the morning.

For the record, drying the rash in open air is effective in helping clear up the diaper rash., Various diaper creams are available without a prescription. Zinc oxide is an ingredient in many creams and can be effective alone to treat a moderate rash. But petroleum ointment or petroleum jelly, non-petroleum jelly, and lanolin products work, too.


Zinc oxide, commonly known as Desitin, provides an effective barrier against skin irritants which lessen friction to irritated skin.(In other words, it protects against stool and urine.)
Skip the talcum powder; it's bad for the lungs.If you must, opt for a cornstarch powder, but even that isn't great -- it can cause yeast to grow and lead to another rash., Though general moisture was probably the culprit, there are a number of reasons your baby could have gotten the rash in the first place:Chemical sensitivity. Try switching what diapers (or if you use cloth diapers, switching detergents),t lotions, or powders. It's possible your baby's skin just doesn't handle certain products well.

New foods. If you've recently started introducing solid food -- or even just a different kind of food -- the change in diet could produce a change in stool, eliciting the rash. And if you're breastfeeding, it could be something you're eating.

Infection. If it doesn't go away, it's possible it's a bacterial or yeast infection. We'll cover that next.

Antibiotics. If your child is on medication (or you are and you're breastfeeding), the antibiotics could be reducing the amount of good bacteria in your or your child's system, allowing the bad ones to fester, producing a rash.

, While general diaper rash is nothing to break a sweat over, if it doesn't go away in 3-4 days, your baby may have a yeast infection. Regular diaper creams won't solve the problem, so you'll need to visit your local pharmacy for an over-the-counter mild corticosteroid cream or your pediatrician for a prescription.


The protocol for handling a yeast diaper rash is basically the same as with regular diaper rash (provided you don't see any other symptoms other than a rash). Keep your baby as dry as possible, use an antifungal cream, and give it a few days.

, If you're following the steps above, diaper rash shouldn't be a problem. Get your baby's bottom thoroughly clean, pat it dry, and, if he seems susceptible to rash, use an ointment after every diaper change.Skip the powders and secure the diaper loosely.


Introduce new foods one at a time. Since new foods can cause problems to sprout up, it's best to know which ones you need to avoid.
Breastfeed your child for as long as you can; the natural antibodies in breastmilk can up her defenses against infections.
Make sure all his alternative caregivers follow the proper protocol.

, Moms and dads are the kickstarters of the home remedy, so rest assured you'd be in good company. If for some reason you can't follow the standard steps, consider one of the following ideas:Try spreading on a thin layer of virgin coconut oil and zinc oxide. Use it just like you would a diaper cream.
Give your baby a sitz bath with a spoonful of baking soda. Some mothers also believe in adding some oatmeal as an inflammatory agent.
Mix a paste together of Nystatin, Desitin, and Hydrocortisone for ultimate effectiveness.

Always be wary of home remedies, especially when it comes to your baby's health. Talk to a doctor before you try anything.

Get a diagnosis of allergic colitis.,
Switch to an extensively-hydrolyzed formula.,
Avoid switching to a soy-based formula.,
Follow up with the doctor after three weeks.,
Switch to an amino acid-based formula if your baby's allergic colitis is severe.",How to Treat Allergic Colitis in Babies1," If your baby has bloody stools, gastrointestinal problems (like nausea, vomiting or diarrhea), or seems extremely fussy or irritable, get them examined by their pediatrician. The pediatrician may diagnose your baby with mild to moderate or severe allergic colitis, a reaction to an allergen that the baby is getting through their diet. The doctor will work with you to find a formula that the baby isn't allergic to.
, If your baby is currently taking formula and has mild to moderate allergic colitis, talk with the doctor about choosing a hypoallergenic formula. Look for an extensively-hydrolyzed formula to offer your baby. Extensively-hydrolyzed formulas break down the protein found in cow's milk so it's easier for your baby to digest. 90% of babies with cow's milk allergies are able to use extensively-hydrolyzed formula.

, While you may consider offering a soy formula, remember that soy can also be an allergen. 8 to 14% of babies with a cow's milk allergy are also allergic to soy. Studies have shown that soy-based formulas may actually increase your baby's risk for developing a soy allergy (especially if they're under six months old)., Your baby will probably need to be checked about three weeks after switching to an extensively-hydrolyzed formula. The doctor will monitor any changes in growth and ask if there have been any allergic reactions.

If your baby reacted to the extensively-hydrolyzed formula, the doctor will recommend changing to an amino acid-based formula which is even easier for your baby to digest. You'll have to follow up again in another two to three weeks.

, If your baby hasn't improved after switching to an extensively-hydrolyzed formula or their allergic colitis was diagnosed as severe, switch to an amino-acid based formula. These hypoallergenic formulas are designed for babies who are allergic to the extensively-hydrolyzed formulas.

Depending on the severity of your baby's allergic colitis, you'll need to talk with the doctor about when to follow up after changing formulas. For example, the doctor may want to see your baby after two weeks.

See a pediatric subspecialist if your baby has severe allergic colitis.",How to Treat Allergic Colitis in Babies2," If your baby has bloody stools, gastrointestinal problems (like nausea, vomiting or diarrhea), or seems extremely fussy or irritable, get them examined by their pediatrician. The pediatrician may diagnose your baby with mild to moderate or severe allergic colitis, a reaction to an allergen that the baby is getting through their diet. You'll need to talk about changes to your diet so you're not passing any allergens through your breast milk., If you're breastfeeding your baby, talk with the doctor about your baby's feeding schedule. You'll also need to inform the doctor about your own diet since the baby may be reacting to an allergen that's passing through breast milk. The doctor will talk with you about starting an elimination diet, where you remove the allergic food from your diet so your breast milk doesn't contain the allergen.

The doctor will probably ask if you're on any special diet or if you're consuming cow's milk.

, Since cow's milk is the most common allergen, you'll most likely need to eliminate it from your diet immediately. You'll need to stop drinking cow's milk and avoid eating products made with cow's milk. Instead, try to substitute dairy free products (like hemp or nut-based milks and products). Avoid products that contain:Cow's milk or cream
Cheese
Butter
Ice cream
Sour cream
Cottage cheese

, Since you won't be getting as much calcium in your diet from dairy sources, you'll need to take a daily calcium supplement. Look for a daily supplement that contains 1000 mg of calcium. Take the supplement as long as you're on the elimination diet.You can also get calcium from non-dairy foods. For example, eat more broccoli, dark leafy greens, beans, fish with bones (like canned salmon or sardines).

, If your baby is allergic to the protein in cow's milk, you should notice an improvement within 72 to 96 hours of removing cow's milk from your diet. Many notice the allergic reactions clear up within a few weeks. Check back with the doctor after two weeks of the elimination diet.

The doctor can also give you advice about gradually reintroducing the allergenic food back into your diet after a few months., If your baby's symptoms do not improve after eliminating cow's milk from your diet, you can slowly begin eating it again. Eliminate one more allergenic food for at least two weeks to see if your baby improves. Talk with the doctor about removing these allergenic foods one at a time:

Soy
Citrus fruits
Eggs
Nuts (especially peanuts)
Wheat
Corn
Strawberries
Chocolate

, If the doctor diagnoses your baby with severe allergic colitis, you'll probably be told to start the elimination diet and make an appointment with a pediatric subspecialist. A pediatric allergist or gastroenterologist will examine your baby to make a more specific diagnosis and treatment plan.The subspecialist may want you to switch from breastfeeding to a hypoallergenic formula depending on results of blood tests.

Notice if the infant is coughing or crying.,
Call for emergency medical support.

,
Position the baby correctly.,
Begin back blows.,
Change the baby's position to begin chest compressions.,
Apply chest compressions.,
Repeat front compressions and back thrusts until the child coughs, breathes or falls unconscious.",How to Treat a Conscious Choking Infant," If so, wait. The infant may expel the foreign object he or she is choking on. Do not try to dislodge anything from the baby's throat at this point as the attempt may just push the item down further. Proceed with steps to treating a choking infant only when it is guaranteed the infant is choking. This will be evident from the child not being able to breathe or cough. In some instances, the infant may start to turn blue.;
,, Begin by sitting down. Lay the baby on his or her back along the length of your forearm. Make a baby sandwich by placing your other arm over the baby's front. Hold the jaw between your thumb and fingers. This is a very important step as it stabilizes the baby's head as you continue to carry out the baby Heimlich process. Flip the infant, in your arms, so he or she is now facing downward and resting on the forearm of the arm that was originally on top. Rest the arm with the baby in it on your leg. To proceed, the baby's head should not be higher that his or her chest.

, Use the base of your palm to apply 5 blows to the infant's back, right at the area between the shoulder blades. You should do this with a decent amount of force.

, Turn the baby back over, so his or her head is facing upward again. Use the sandwich method described above. Make sure that your bottom hand is supporting the baby's head. Rest your arm and the baby on your leg again, keeping his or her head lower than the chest.

, Draw an imaginary line connecting the baby's nipples. Place the tip of your ring finger on the center of the chest, just below where this line crosses. Lay the padded tips of your pointer and middle fingers down on the breastbone and lift your ring finger up. If you can feel the gap at the base of the breastbone, slide your fingers up a little. Give 5 firm compressions on the chest. The right amount of pressure causes the breastbone to give about 1/2 - 1 inch and then retaliate between compressions.

, If the child becomes unconscious, proceed with steps on caring for a choking infant that is unconscious.

Monitor the frequency of your child’s bowel movements.,
Look at the color of your child’s stool.,
Pay attention to any changes in smell.,
Check the density and composition of your child’s stool.",How to Tell if Your Newborn Has Diarrhea1," The frequency, in part, is affected by whether you are feeding your baby breastmilk or formula. Babies who are breastfed during the first three months of their lives will generally pass stool right after being fed. This means that a breastfed baby could pass stool 8 to 10 times a day.A baby who is fed formula will generally pass 1 to 8 stools a day for the first week of her life. After the first week, a formula-fed baby will pass between 1 and 4 stools a day.
Over time, you will see a pattern in your child’s habits of passing stool. Knowing this pattern will help you to recognize when the stool is more frequent than normal. When your child passes more stool than normal in a day, it is considered diarrhea.;
, Children who are breastfed generally have loose, yellow, or yellow-green stool.Keep in mind that green stool is just an indication that your child is drinking breast milk.Children who are fed formula generally have paler stools that may look a bit like peanut butter.
If you notice that your child’s stools are a different color than normal, then it may be an indication that your child has diarrhea.

, While stool is generally pretty stinky, take note if your child’s stool smells much more intensely than normal. Very intense smelling stool can be an indication of diarrhea., Diarrhea is more watery than normal stool, is comprised of more water than solid parts, and can cause a big mess.


Other signs that often accompany diarrhea include fever, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain."

Talk to your doctor about sudden changes.",How to Tell if Your Baby Is a Healthy Weight," Most full-term babies weigh between six and nine pounds at birth. However, it is possible for a baby to be healthy even if she weighs more or less than average at birth.Remember that weight is not the only determining factor of health. Your baby's doctor will be able to let you know if there is anything you should be concerned about.;
, The Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization offer standardized growth charts for male and female babies based on length and age. These charts are used to calculate your child's percentile. A high percentile means your child is large compared to other children his age, while a low percentile means he is small compared to other children his age.A low percentile only means that your baby is small, not necessarily that he is behind developmentally.
Despite the usefulness of growth charts for indicating a healthy weight range for infants, every baby is different. In most cases, simple welfare checks on your baby will indicate whether he is gaining enough weight to be healthy and to allow for adequate growth and development.
There are different growth charts for babies who are breast-fed and babies who are formula-fed because they tend to grow at different rates., Growth charts do not take genetic factors into account, and these play a huge role in determining your baby's weight. Be sure to think about the height and weight of both parents when processing information about your baby's size.If both parents are shorter than average, it should not be surprising that the baby would be in a lower percentile, as she is likely to be short as well. (The average height in the United States is 5'8"" for men and 5'3"" for women.)
If, on the other hand, both parents are taller than average, a low percentile may warrant more careful monitoring.
In addition, babies with certain genetic disorders or other medical conditions such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, or heart disease may also grow at a different rate.

, Most infants lose some weight in the first few days after birth, and then slowly begin to gain it back. As long as your baby does not lose more than 10% of his birth weight and starts gaining weight within the next few days, there is usually no cause for concern.Most babies get back to their birth weight by 2 weeks.


Babies typically gain about five to seven ounces a week after this initial weight loss and double their birth weight within three to four months. If your baby is not on track to gain this much weight, talk to your pediatrician about your concerns., Babies who are born prematurely have different nutritional needs than babies who are born at full term. They may not be able to feed properly and their bodies may not yet be capable of processing food normally, which is why they are often kept in the NICU. The goal of this specialized care is to help the premature baby grow at the same rate that she would have if she were still in the womb, which is faster than a full-term baby would be expected to grow.There are growth charts tailored to premature babies.

, Regular bathroom scales will not show sufficient detail for your baby’s weight. Instead, buy a special scale designed to weigh infants. Keep track of your measurements so you can discuss them with your baby's doctor if necessary.


Weigh your baby on a regular schedule to get an overall picture of weight gain and fluctuation. Avoid daily weighing or weighing multiple times per day unless instructed to do so by a physician for medical purposes, as weight naturally fluctuates.
Posting a growth chart near your scale can help you keep track of which percentile your baby is in.
Remember that it's more important that your baby is growing consistently than that he falls within a certain percentile., If your baby is not getting enough food, you will probably notice physical changes. If your baby appears healthy, her weight is probably not an issue.She should be making soft stools several times a day in the first few weeks of life. After that, in general she should poop at least every few days.
Her urine should be clear or light yellow and odor-free.
Her skin should be a healthy color.
You should be changing approximately six to eight wet diapers each day.

, Keep track of how often your baby is eating and how much he is eating. If you are breast feeding, keep track of the amount of time spent feeding. If you are bottle feeding or if your baby is already eating solid foods, keep track of the quantities.


If you notice any indications that he may not be eating enough, such as multiple meals in a row without finishing, eating only small portions of meals, or going for several hours at a time with no food or drink, talk to your pediatrician.

, Weight is one factor that influences good health, but it is not the only one. Because there are a lot of genetic factors that influence weight, tracking developmental milestones is a much better way of making sure your baby is growing properly., Your baby may not be getting the nutrition she needs if she isn't latching on properly when you breastfeed her. These issues can usually be corrected with a little support, so reach out to your doctor or a lactation specialist if you have any of the following issues:Your baby sucks in her cheeks or makes clicking noises while feeding.
Your baby seems unsettled after feeding
Your baby seems to have a hard time swallowing
Your breasts don't feel less full after a feeding
Your nipples are sore or misshapen

, If your baby seems uninterested in eating and/or is consistently losing weight, schedule an appointment with your pediatrician right away. There are many congenital medical conditions and infections that can cause poor feeding, so it's important to get a diagnosis as soon as possible.Be sure to mention all other symptoms to your doctor as well, including vomiting and diarrhea, gagging, or coughing.
If your baby is a picky eater, there is usually no cause for concern. Poor feeding means that the baby has little interest in any food, not just in specific foods.

, If your baby is dehydrated, he is not getting enough milk or formula, so it's very important to correct the cause of the problem right away. Common symptoms of dehydration include:Fewer wet diapers.
Urine that is darker than normal.
Jaundice (yellow skin).
Decreased activity or increased sleepiness.
Dry mouth.

, Fluctuations are normal, but if you notice any drastic changes, it's best to consult your baby's doctor. For example, if your baby was gaining weight at a consistent pace, but then suddenly started losing weight, this warrants a visit to the doctor. It may be nothing at all, or it may be something that requires medical intervention."

Be aware that viruses commonly cause diarrhea.,
Monitor your own diet if you are breastfeeding.,
Talk to your baby’s doctor if she is taking antibiotics and begins to have diarrhea.,
Get your baby tested for parasites.",How to Tell if Your Newborn Has Diarrhea2," Viruses can get inside the intestines, causing the intestines to stop absorbing nutrients while leaking water. Diarrhea caused by viruses generally last up to two weeks, with two to three really intense days.Rotavirus is a common virus that causes diarrhea in newborns. Talk to your doctor about getting a vaccine against this virus for your child., What you eat can have an effect on your baby’s digestive system. In particular, drinking tea, coffee, and cola can upset your baby’s stomach., Antibiotics can kill bad bacteria, but they also kill off the good bacteria in your child’s intestines. Because of this, the digestive system can be disrupted.

, If your baby picks up a parasite, such as giardiasis, she will more than likely begin to have diarrhea.Other symptoms of a parasitic infection include:


Abdominal pain
Gas
Bloating

Watch your baby for signs of dehydration.,
Look out for diaper rash.,
Know when to call a doctor.",How to Tell if Your Newborn Has Diarrhea3," Having diarrhea can leave your baby very dehydrated very quickly. Dehydration is dangerous because, if severe enough, it can lead to kidney decline, seizures, and brain swelling.Signs that your baby is dehydrated include:


Dry skin and dry mouth
Crying without tears
Not urinating for more than eight hours, and if your baby does urinate, the urine is very dark in color.
Weakness and fatigue

, Diarrhea is generally more acidic than regular stool, so it can irritate your baby’s sensitive skin.

, If your see blood or mucus in your baby’s stool, you should contact your pediatrician.If your baby vomits for more than 8 hours, and refuses to drink any liquid, you should bring her to the hospital right away.


If you notice signs of dehydration like those listed in the step above, contact your doctor.
If your baby’s temperature reaches above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), and your baby is 6 months or younger, take her to the hospital.If your baby has abdominal pain or a bloated stomach, that is accompanied by cramping in her legs, take your baby to the hospital immediately."

Prevent your baby from becoming dehydrated by giving her electrolytes.,
Make an ORS at home.,
Give your baby more frequent, smaller meals.,
Switch to a lactose-free formula.,
Change your baby’s diaper frequently.",How to Tell if Your Newborn Has Diarrhea4," Treating diarrhea involves keeping your child from becoming dehydrated, rather than giving her diarrhea medications. These medications can have unwanted side effects.


Give your baby an Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS). An ORS contains salts and sugars that are lost because of the diarrhea and vomiting. A commonly used ORS is Pedialyte.

, While store bought ORSs are convenient, they can also be a little expensive. You can make your own ORS by:


Boiling one liter of water and then letting it cool. Add 8 teaspoons of sugar and one teaspoon of salt.
Give your baby 2 to 4 ounces of ORS after every time she passes watery stools., If your baby will breastfeed or accept formula, give her small amounts of milk or formula more often than you normally would. Keep these meals to small amounts so as not to overwhelm your baby’s digestive system.


If your baby vomits after eating, give her some ORS.

, Milk-based formulas can sometimes exacerbate diarrhea, even if your child is not lactose intolerant. While your baby has diarrhea, switch her to a formula that does not contain cow’s milk.Try feeding your baby a soy-based formula for a couple of days until her diarrhea clears up.

, This can help to clear up diaper rash and prevent it in the future. When you change your baby’s diaper, allow her skin to be exposed to fresh air for a little while, and make sure to wash her bottom with warm water.


Apply a petroleum jelly-based cream to your child’s skin before putting a new diaper on.

Determine if the diaper rash is caused by yeast infection.,
Investigate whether or not there is a yeast infection in the baby's mouth.,
Promote good oral hygiene and sterilize anything that comes in contact with the baby's mouth.,
Outfit your baby with natural, breathable diapers.,
Apply a protective barrier to the baby's bottom.",How to Treat a Baby with a Yeast Infection1," Babies are prone to having diaper rash because of trapped moisture inside their diapers. A normal diaper rash should disappear within days. If the diaper rash is caused by a yeast infection, there will be appearance of small red pinpoint patches that move away from the center and covers the baby's bottom.


Also, if the mother or the baby is taking antibiotics, the rash is likely caused by a yeast infection, because antibiotics kill the good bacteria that balance the naturally occurring yeast in the body.;
, It is easy to determine whether there is a yeast infection in the baby’s mouth. If there are white patches surrounding the sides of the mouth, the tongue, gums, or lips, a yeast infection is probably present.


These patches can look like a curd of milk or undigested milk.
Don’t take it off as it can cause soreness.

, Sterilize items that come in contact with the mouth such as pacifiers, toys, or milk bottles. If you are breastfeeding make sure you clean your nipples using a cotton and water before latching your baby. This will ensure that fungal bacteria from the toy do not enter your baby’s mouth the next the item goes into his/her mouth.


Most bottles, teats, and spoons can be sterilized in a saucepan filled with water, such that the equipment is completely submerged.
If your baby is being exclusively breastfed or bottle-fed, then make sure you gently wipe your baby’s tongue and gums with a soft cloth dipped in warm water after every feed. This will remove any residual milk in the mouth, and deter the yeast from thriving.
If your baby is old enough to accept top-feed, give him/her a sip of sterilized water after every feed. This will rinse away the residual milk, sugar, or food in the mouth, which help Candida to flourish.

, Diapers made of natural fabrics are more breathable than their synthetic counterparts. Increased airflow and circulation in the diaper will help reduce the chance of yeast development, and natural diapers allow this without constantly removing the diaper to allow for drying.


After every diaper change, allow the baby's bottom to air dry for some time before replacing the diaper.

, Try using plain coconut oil, petroleum jelly, or diaper rash ointment every time you put your baby in a diaper. These ointments act as protective layers on the baby’s skin, minimizing direct contact with urine and fecal matter. This will help to prevent the development of yeast and other rashes.


This barrier will also help keep the skin dry.

, Many babies suffering from colic stretch their legs out or pull their feet up under their bodies, as though trying to ease a cramp. They may also clench their fists so tightly that they start to shake.

, If gas is causing your baby's colic, his or her stomach may become slightly enlarged.

, Many colicky babies have notably loud rumbling stomachs.

, If the amount seems especially large during his or her crying fits, there is a good chance your baby is suffering from colic.

, Other conditions, such as a twist in the intestine or a hernia, may create similar symptoms. If your pediatrician rules these conditions out, the doctor may feel more confident in diagnosing your baby with colic.

Change the baby's diaper frequently.,
Use cotton and water when cleaning the baby’s bottom.,
Allow your baby to go without a diaper several hours per day.,
Use plain yogurt to naturally deter yeast from the bottom.",How to Treat a Baby with a Yeast Infection2," Usually, babies defecates and pee a few minutes after they are fed. You should always change the diaper when it gets wet to prevent moisture from accumulating around the bottom of the baby. Fungus thrives in warm and moist environments, so always change the diaper after defecation or urination to prevent rash from occurring.


Also, when securing the baby’s diaper, make sure that it is not too tight to allow air to circulate.

, Avoid using scented baby wipes as the chemicals can irritate the yeast rashes. You can use mild baby cleansers when cleaning the bottom. Be sure to rinse and dry it thoroughly, to avoid moisture build up that will cause the yeast infection to spread.

, This will ensure that the baby's bottom is fresh and moisture free. Air exposure will definitely prevent rashes from occurring, or if one is present already, will facilitate fast recovery.


You can put a waterproof sheet or a towel underneath to prevent a mess from the baby pooping and peeing.

, Yogurt is rich in probiotics and contains live microorganisms that can help boost the normal flora. You can apply the yogurt to the bottom, but make sure that there are no open wounds when applying it.


Apply it in a circular motion, and allow it to stay for 15 minutes. Then, rinse the baby's bottom with water and let it dry before putting a new diaper.
Do this three times daily.
However, you cannot let the baby take yogurt orally, as yogurt is not good for babies under one year of age to eat.

Apply an over-the-counter (OTC) fungal cream on affected areas.,
Use barrier ointments to prevent build-up of moisture in the diaper.,
Know when to seek medical help.",How to Treat a Baby with a Yeast Infection3," These ointments can be applied to the diaper rash every time you change a diaper, until the rash resolves.


Nystatin (Mycostatin), Clotrimazole (Lotrimin), Miconazole (Micatin) are common OTC antifungal topical treatments that can treat yeast infections.
Refer to the patient information leaflet for more directions and instructions on how to use these topical creams. It usually takes 4 to 7 days before it heals.

, You should apply this only after bathing and drying the baby thoroughly. Apply on affected areas liberally, to prevent a yeast-friendly environment from developing in the diaper.


These ointments include Zinc oxide (A&D ointment, Diaparene) or Petroleum jelly (Aquaphor, Vaseline).

, You should be knowledgeable of the symptoms that appear when a yeast infection becomes worse. If none of the over-the-counter medications or natural remedies work, seek the help of a pediatrician or general practitioner. These symptoms indicate that you should seek professional help:


Rash increases within 3 to 4 days.
Presence of a fever of more than 37.5 degree Celsius.
Your baby may look sluggish or weak.
Presence of yellow fluid-filled bumps.
Presence of honey-like crusty areas. This indicates bacterial infection and the doctor may prescribe certain antibiotics for treatment.

Keep a notebook and mark down the details of your baby's crying fits.,
Think back to when the crying fits began.,
Monitor how long crying fits last each day.,
Look at how many days per week your baby has a fit.,
Pay attention to when the crying fits occur.,
Do not lose hope.",How to Tell if Your Baby Has Colic2," Doing so will allow you to monitor when the fits begin and how long they last. The timing and duration of cries can help you determine whether or not your baby suffers from colic.

, Typically, colicky babies start having fits within the first 3 weeks of life. Even at its latest, colic usually starts within the first 5 months. Additionally, if your baby has been suffering from these bouts of crying for three weeks or more, there is a good chance that he or she may suffer from colic.

, Most colicky babies have fits that last three hours or more.

, In order to be diagnosed with colic, a baby must have uncontrollable crying fits at least 3 days a week.

, Most colicky babies experience fits during the same time each day. Often, this occurs in the late afternoon or early evening.

, Most colicky babies do not have symptoms that last longer than three months. If your baby's cries have far exceeded that timeline, you should consult your pediatrician about other diagnoses.

Find the areas where the infant’s pulse is strongest.,
Wash your hands.,
Prepare the necessary materials.,
Place the infant on his or her back.,
Make sure that the infant is not crying before taking the pulse.,
Locate the apical pulse.,
Place your stethoscope on the baby’s chest.,
Listen for the pulse.,
Count the heart rate of the infant for one full minute for accurate results.",How to Take an Infant's Pulse1," An infant’s pulse is stronger in the apical area, or left part, of the chest near the heart.You can choose any of the two in taking an infant’s pulse.


It is also strong in the brachial area, or the inner bend of the arm at the back of the elbow.;
, Infants have weaker immune systems than adults. Because of this, is it important that you rinse your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap. This will help to prevent you from transmitting any harmful microorganisms to the infant.

, When taking an infant’s pulse rate, it is helpful to use a stethoscope to allow you to hear the pulse. A stethoscope can be purchased at your local pharmacy. You will also need:


A watch that counts seconds.
Pen and paper.

, Doing this will help to keep the infant’s pulse rate from increasing, which could throw off the accuracy of your results. You can place the child between two pillows so that she cannot roll away, or you can ask someone to hold the infant on her back while you take the reading.When an infant is placed in a vertical position, blood flows to the lower extremities due to the force of gravity, which causes the heart to beat faster. The heart beats faster because the heart has to work harder to pump blood to the different parts of the body., Extreme emotions activate the sympathetic nervous system (a part of the brain that increases vital signs such as the heart rate, breathing and blood pressure). As a result, if the infant is unhappy, the heart rate will increase suddenly.If the infant begins to cry, soothe her and wait for her to calm down before you try taking her pulse.

, If the baby is wearing a dress or shirt with Velcro straps or ties, undo these so that you can expose the baby’s chest without removing the entire dress. To find the apical pulse:


Place your pointer finger on the middle part of the baby’s left clavicle, or collarbone (this is the long bone in the chest that is near the shoulder blade).
Glide your finger down slowly to locate the first intercostal space (this refers to the space between each rib).
Move down to the second and third intercostal space, until you reach the fourth space. This is where you should be able to feel the apical pulse most strongly. This spot is known as the spot of maximal impulse.

, Warm the stethoscope up by placing the large metal circle (this is known as the diaphragm) in the palm of your hand for at least 10 seconds.


Warning up the diaphragm will help to keep the infant from being startled by the cold metal and beginning to cry.

, Insert the earpieces of the stethoscope and place the diaphragm on to the apical pulse, or the fourth intercostal space. Again, this should be the fourth space you find between the ribs when you run your finger down from the baby’s left collarbone.


You should hear a loud “lub-dub” sound when you put your stethoscope over the apical pulse. The “lub-dub” sound is considered one whole beat.

, The count should start when the “dub” sound is heard.Get the pen and paper and record the number of pulses or heartbeats you hear in the space of 60 seconds.
Wash your hands thoroughly when you are done recording the pulse rate.

"
"
Wash your hands.,
Gather your supplies.,
Hold the infant so he or she is on his or her back.,
Soothe the child if he or she is crying.,
Warm your hands.,
Use your fingers to find the pulse.",How to Take an Infant's Pulse2," As mentioned above, you should always wash your hands when taking an infant’s pulse in order to avoid passing any microorganisms on to the infant.

, You will not need a stethoscope to listen to the brachial pulse, as it is not as loud as the apical pulse so you will most likely not be able to hear it. Instead, you will use your pointer and middle finger to feel the pulse.You will also need:


A watch that counts seconds
A pen and paper

, Again, as mentioned above, it is important to take the infant’s pulse when she is lying on her back because when an infant is held in a vertical position, her heart rate tends to increase. .This is because her heart is working harder to pump blood down into the lower extremities and back out again.

, Make sure that the infant is not crying before taking the pulse as extreme emotions activate the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system, when activated, will increase the heart rate.Do your best to soothe the infant and make sure that she is calm before you take a measurement of her pulse, otherwise you may not get an accurate reading.

, You can do this by rubbing your hands together. If you have cold hands, placing them on the infant’s sensitive skin may cause her to become startled, in which case she may begin to cry.

, Put your point and middle finger on the infant’s inner bend of the upper arm at the back of the elbow. Press your fingers firmly but gently against the baby’s skin to try to feel the pulse.


Count the pulse rate of the infant for one full minute for accurate results. Get the pen and paper and record the number of times you feel the infant’s pulse beat in the span of 60 seconds.
Consider repeating this process for another 60 seconds to double-check your findings.

Seek medical help if you find a fast heart rate or tachycardia.,
Call a doctor if you find a slow heart rate or bradycardia.,
Seek medical attention if you hear a third heart sound.,
Contact a doctor if you hear a fourth heart sound.",How to Take an Infant's Pulse3," A fast heart rate I considered a pulse rate of more than 160 beats per minute at rest. A fast heart beat does not allow the heart to have sufficient time to fill before it contracts, so blood flow to the different parts of the body is compromised., A slow heart rate is considered less than 140 beats per minute at rest. If the heartbeat is slow, the heart is unable to supply enough blood to the different parts of the body.

, Normally, the heart makes two sounds during each beat: “lub”, which is considered the first heart sound (S1) and “dub”, which is the second heart sound (S2). A third heart sound (S3), is often described as a horse gallop sound, which makes the heartbeat sound like “lub du bub”.A third heart sound can be related to conditions such as congestive heart failure (the heart muscle does not pump enough blood), cardiomyopathy (weakening of the heart muscle) and valvular regurgitation (backflow of blood because of incompetent valves)., This fourth sound, which is called S4, makes the heartbeat sound like “Be lub dup”—S1, then S4, then S2.A fourth heart sound can be related to conditions such as the stenosis of heart blood vessels (narrowing of blood vessels), ischemia (lack of oxygen supply to the heart), cardiomyopathy (weakening of heart muscle) and valvular regurgitation

Sit your baby upright.,
Nurse your baby.,
Burp your baby.,
Give your baby a pacifier.,
Give your baby water, if she is older than six months.",How to Stop Baby Hiccups1," Sitting your baby upright may help relieve the pressure in her diaphragm. The gas that is distending her stomach will rise to the surface, allowing her to burp and release the pressure.;
, Hiccups are spasms of the diaphragm. Breastfeeding your baby may help her diaphragm relax, stopping hiccup attacks in their tracks. Refer to this method on preventing hiccups while feeding.


Be sure to feed your baby slowly so that she does not suckle too much milk too quickly. Pause to burp her at intervals, and give her plenty of time to digest.

, Burping, especially between feedings, brings trapped air to the surface of your baby's stomach. This can help relieve the gas buildup that could lead to hiccups.

, Sucking on a pacifier can help regulate your baby's breathing and relax the diaphragm.

, Fill a glass of water about halfway full, and pull a tissue tight across the rim to regulate the flow. Gently give your baby a few small sips of water. Be sparing.


Babies do not need to drink water until they are six months old--up til that point, they get all of the hydration that they need from breast milk or formula. Giving a baby younger than six months too much water can interfere with her body's ability to absorb the nutrients in breast milk, as well as curbing her appetite by making her feel full."
"
Consider keeping a hiccup trigger log.,
Feed your baby twice as often, but half as much at each feeding.,
Burp your baby.,
Review your latching technique.,
Feed your baby before she gets too hungry.,
Sit your baby upright in your lap while feeding.,
Keep your baby sitting up for at least twenty minutes after a feeding so that any trapped air rises to the top of her stomach.,
Be patient.",How to Stop Baby Hiccups2," When your baby gets into a hiccuping fit, write down the date, the time, and the circumstances. Which settings and feeding practices seem to trigger your baby's hiccups?


If your baby hiccups during and directly after breast- or bottle-feeding, she may be eating too quickly or gulping excess air. Review the following steps to prevent your baby from hiccuping while feeding.
If your baby hiccups at night, painfully, in association with painful vomiting, this may be a sign of acid reflux disease. Refer to Step 4 to learn about acid reflux.

, If the stomach expands too quickly or becomes overfull, it can trigger the diaphragm to spasm into a hiccuping fit. Thus, babies can begin to hiccup when they suckle too much milk, too quickly. Feeding your baby less milk at shorter intervals will ensure that she does not fill up too quickly. , Stop to burp your baby midway through a feeding, once she has suckled 2 to 3 ounces (60-90mL). This will break up the feeding and give your baby time to digest.


If you are breastfeeding: Pause to burp your baby as you switch from one breast to another. This may aid the digestion process. Wait a few minutes before resuming the feeding in order to give your baby time to digest.
If you are bottle-feeding: Pause halfway through the bottle to burp your baby. Finish off the feeding a few minutes later once your baby has had time to digest.

, Babies can also begin to hiccup when they swallow too much air during feeding. Listen for rhythmic, regular sucking. If your baby is nursing too quickly and sucking in air, you will hear her gulping and swallowing loudly.


If you are breastfeeding: Make sure that your baby's lips are opened wide and that they form a tight seal around your entire areola—not just the nipple. Avoid hunching or leaning forward when you breastfeed, as this may make it difficult for your baby to latch.
Aim your nipple at the top of your baby's mouth. Do this when your baby opens her mouth widely so that the nipple lays directly onto her tongue. If her mouth doesn't open wide naturally, encourage her by gently touching her lips and her mouth. Pull her towards you with pressure her back, not her head.
If you are bottle-feeding: Tilt the bottle to a 45-degree angle, bottom-up, so that your baby sucks in more formula than air. Consider using a bottle with collapsible bag inserts, as these are designed to reduce air swallowing.

, Plan feeding times at regular intervals, and learn to tell when your baby is hungry. A calm baby will eat more slowly than a hungry, upset baby.

, This will prevent air from settling in her stomach, expanding, and triggering hiccups. Hold your baby close so that his chest is close to yours--he should be looking straight ahead or up a little.


You may find it easier to sit down while feeding in order to keep your baby on your lap. Sit straight up, leaning back a bit, so that you feel relaxed and comfortable.

, This will relieve the pressure on her diaphragm, allowing her to burp and release the gas.

, If your baby begins to hiccup during a feeding session, stop feeding her and let her digest for five to ten minutes.Keep her sitting upright and try to feed her again, slowly, once the hiccuping stops.

"
"
Give your baby some sugar.,
Massage your baby's back.,
Be cautious when using folk hiccup cures that have not been medically verified.",How to Stop Baby Hiccups3," This remedy has not been proven to stop hiccups, but there's no harm in giving it a try. Wet your finger or a pacifier and dip the tip into a sugar bowl. Let your baby suck on the sugar for a few minutes, and the hiccups may fade away.

, Place your baby on a flat surface on her belly, and allow her to move around a little bit. Gently massage her back for a several minutes. This may help to loosen the sort of gas buildup that may be causing the hiccups.


If your baby seems uncomfortable with the massage, stop immediately.

, The following folk ""remedies"" have not been demonstrated to stop hiccups, and they can actually hurt your baby. Never try any of these methods:


""Scaring"" the hiccups away by making a loud noise or otherwise shocking your baby.
Slapping your baby's back.
Pressing your baby's eyeballs.
Pulling your baby's tongue.

"
Watch your baby for vomiting and stomach pain.,
Tell when your baby is in pain.,
Contact your pediatrician.",How to Stop Baby Hiccups4," Frequent hiccup attacks may be a sign of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or acid reflux. This is a common condition in which babies painfully regurgitate the contents of their stomach into their esophagus.Look out for the following symptoms:


Colicky behavior (frequent, intense crying fits)
Stomach pain
Frequent, painful vomiting
Persistent coughing or wheezing
Hiccuping at night, unconnected to feeding

, Your baby may be experiencing chronic stomach pain if she cries often and inconsolably, long after she has been changed, fed, and cared for. She may begin to cry suddenly, for no apparent reason.

, If you suspect that your baby suffers from acid reflux, take her to see your family pediatrician. A licensed physician will be able to help you understand what's going on with your baby, and may be able to advise treatment.


In babies, GERD is usually caused by an immature digestive system.
Most babies grow out of GERD by their first birthday. Your doctor may advise you to wait it out. Be aware that older children may be at a greater risk for acid reflux if they experienced the disease as an infant."

Tuck in any hanging strings.,
Strap your kid into the stroller.,
Put the bags away.,
Check to make sure you have some space.,
Pick up the front wheels.,
Hold on to the stroller.,
Lift the front wheels over the comb-plate when exiting.,
Push hard when existing.,
Exit as quickly as possible.",How to Take a Stroller on an Escalator1," Straps, shoelaces, and anything hanging down can get caught in the escalator, causing disaster. Make sure to tie shoes, buckle straps, and pull up anything hanging down before getting on the escalator.





;
, If your stroller comes with safety straps, make sure your kid is strapped in before entering the escalator. This step is especially important when you're going down, as you'll be tipping the stroller forward as you go down.








, Dangling bags off a stroller can also get caught in an escalator. Either tuck them underneath or pack them away in your purse if possible.







, If the escalator is especially crowded, wait a few minutes for it to clear out. You want to have enough space to maneuver on the escalator safely.







, As you enter an up escalator, lift the front wheels over the comb-plate (the start of the escalator).Continue pushing forward with the wheels up. Let the front wheels rest on a higher step and the back wheels on a lower step.








If you're going down, do the opposite. Let the front wheels rest on lower step and the back wheels rest on a higher step.
Also, make sure you step over the comb-plate when entering.

, Make sure to hold on to the stroller the whole time you are on the escalator. Because it is balanced on two steps, it can easily start moving, especially since the escalator is moving.








, Additionally, make sure you step over it, too.







, Sometimes, you'll need to give the stroller a hard push as you get off. That way, you'll be sure the back wheels go over the comb-plate.








, You don't want to block anyone else coming off the escalator.

Take the child out of the stroller.,
Fold up the stroller as small as possible.,
Put one person in charge of the stroller.,
Let the other person carry the child.,
Lift the stroller wheels over the comb-plate.,
Unfold the stroller.",How to Take a Stroller on an Escalator2," Lift your child out to be carried.








This maneuver only works if you have another adult with you.

, Make sure all the straps are tucked inside the folds and not dangling. Also, carry bags in the same hand as a stroller if possible, so you have a hand to grab the rail.







, Try holding it with one hand only so you have a hand to hold on to the handrail. Balance it on one step if possible, pulling it behind you.








If you need to balance it on more than one step, push it in front of you. Be sure to lift the wheels over the comb-plate.

, Also, be sure to hold onto the handrail while carrying your child. Stand in the middle of the escalator, and make sure the kid doesn't stick his or her hands out, as they can get caught.







, At the end, make sure you lift the wheels over the comb-plate to make exiting easier.








, Once you exit the escalator, unfold the stroller, and place your child back in the stroller.

Make sure your kid keeps his or hands in the stroller.,
Watch your own balance.,
Avoid your phone.",How to Take a Stroller on an Escalator3," You can't place both sets of wheels on one step. Therefore, make sure you keep the stroller balanced. If you don't pay attention, the stroller could flip on you.







, You are safer in the middle of the escalator and so is your child in the stroller. The middle is safer because hands, shoelaces, and clothing can get caught in the sides of the escalator.







, You can lose control of the stroller if you don't do so. With the escalator, it's easier to keep the stroller still with both hands.







, Little hands can get caught in the side of the escalator, so watch out for your kid's hand reaching out.







, Obviously, you need to hold onto the stroller. Therefore, it's hard for you to also hold on to the rail. Make sure you stay upright, or you could take you and the stroller down the escalator.







, That is, pay attention to what you're doing instead of looking at your phone. In addition, holding your phone ties up one hand you should be using for holding the stroller.

Play with your baby.,
Have a conversation.,
Read to your baby.,
Listen to music together.",How to Support Your Baby's Development1," Playing is the way that babies learn.It allows them to explore their own bodies, the world around them, and their own minds. Engage your baby in activities that make them smile and laugh to support their mental growth.


Play peek-a-boo and other games with your baby to interact with them.
Give your baby time and space to look and move around in their immediate environment.
Provide different textures and sounds for your baby to experience. For example, show your baby a bumpy ball or fluffy animal.
Not all toys and playthings are safe for your baby to use on their own so be careful about leaving your baby alone with toys, and make sure that you choose age appropriate toys for your baby.;
, One of the best things you can do to support your baby’s mental development is to talk with them. Have a conversation with your baby about what you are doing, what they are doing, and what is going on around them.Treat your baby’s looks, smiles, frowns, gagas, and googoos like responses to what you are saying.
For example, you might say, “I’m cooking dinner right now.” If your baby frowns, you could tell them, “Oh, it doesn’t smell that bad.”
Or, for instance, if your baby is smiling you could say, “Do you like that? What is making you so happy? Is it the smell of the food?”

, Reading exposes your baby to new sounds, words, word patterns, and speech rhythms. It is one of the key’s to language development.Read the same couple of short books to your baby to allow them to become familiar with the words and language in general.
Point to each word, or track them, as you read to model good reading habits to your baby early on.
Let your baby touch the book, it gives them a new sensory experience. If you can, get a board book or plastic book designed for babies to interact with.

, Hearing the tunes, melodies, beats, and more will help your baby develop their sense of hearing and speaking. In addition, there is research that suggests that learning music rhythms is a first step to learning math.Turn on the radio and sing along when the two of you are in the car. Make sure it’s not too loud so you can protect your baby’s hearing.
Sing nursery rhymes and other children’s songs to your baby on a regular basis.

"
"
Give your baby tummy time.,
Be active with your baby.,
Try parent/baby yoga.,
Give your baby a hand.",How to Support Your Baby's Development2," Research shows that being on their stomachs for a couple of minutes supports a baby’s physical development.This position helps them interact with their environment and prepares them to roll, scoot, slide, and crawl.


Always supervise your baby when they are on their tummy. Never leave them alone in this position.
Start off with only two to three minutes at a time. Give your baby time to get accustomed to this position.
Increase the time to about three to five minutes as your baby gets used to it.
Place interesting toys and objects around your baby to encourage them to reach for the toys, roll near them, or crawl toward them.

, Babies are naturally active and you can boost your baby’s physical development by being active with them.When you see your baby being active, do things that encourage them to continue their activity.


Lay down on the floor or bed with your baby and provide toys for them to look for, grab at, and move towards.
For example, you can encourage your baby to move their arms by holding a brightly colored toy out to them.
If your baby is starting to roll over or crawl, lie or sit close to them on the floor and let them use you to pull themself up or to stop themselves from moving once they start rolling.

, This is a great way to support your baby’s physical development while getting physical activity yourself.Doing yoga with your baby also supports your baby developing a secure bond with you.


Attend parent/baby yoga classes in your community for the opportunity for you and your baby to socialize with others.
Check with your baby’s pediatrician before beginning a yoga program with your baby.
Wait until your baby is about 4 months and shows good neck and head control before beginning yoga with them.

, As your baby develops their gross and fine motor skills there will be lots of times they will need you to help them pull up, balance, or just hold their hand.Give your baby the support they need to develop physically.


Let your baby hone their fine motor skills by giving them your finger (or nose) to grasp.
Let your baby use you to pull themselves up when they start to stand.
Remember that your baby will also use other things besides you to be active. Be careful when you leave your baby alone.
For example, a baby starting to walk will use the edges of tables, chairs, and other nearby furniture and objects to help them stand and push off from.

"
"
Be responsive.,
Model appropriate behavior.,
Plan a play date.",How to Support Your Baby's Development3," Similar to having a conversation with your baby, being responsive to your baby’s ‘talking’ and body language will support their emotional and social development.Responding to your baby encourages them to do the action again and lets them know you are paying attention.


Even though infants can’t talk yet, they express their needs, wants, and thoughts through crying, laughing, and other body language.
Pay attention to what your baby is doing for clues for how to respond.
For example, if your baby is babbling, then talk back to them.
Or, for instance, if they are reaching for something that is safe for them to have then make it a little easier to get to.

, Even as a baby, your child will pick up many of their social and emotional learning by observing you.Modeling appropriate behavior is an effective way to support your baby’s development by showing your baby appropriate ways to act.


Stay calm. Even infants can detect anger, hostility, and anxiety in your words and body language.
For example, when you are with your baby and someone upsets you, take a few deep breaths and calm down before responding.
Be respectful with other people. The way you interact with others is one of the first examples of socializing your baby will have.
For instance, yelling at your spouse in front of your baby sets an example that yelling and screaming are appropriate ways to communicate.
On the other hand, talking calmly and having respectful interactions shows your baby how to control their emotions.

, You can support your baby’s social and emotional development by giving them the opportunity to interact with other babies. Experiences like this give your baby the chance to explore new relationships and environments.Look in your community parenting magazine or newspaper for information about playgroups in your area.
Give your baby time to adjust to the new sights, sounds, smells, and people.
Use this opportunity to meet other parents and support your own social health.
Talk to the other parents about how they support their baby’s development.
For example, you might ask another parent, “How do you help your baby develop emotionally?”

"
"
Check-in with your pediatrician.,
Get needed vaccinations on time.,
Learn about developmental milestones.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Support Your Baby's Development4," You should regularly see your baby’s pediatrician in order to effectively support your baby’s development. Your baby’s pediatrician can let you know if everything is okay, give you advice on supporting your baby’s development, and help you take care of yourself as well.


Early on your baby will need to see their pediatrician frequently. As they move from newborn to infant and older, they will see the pediatrician less.
Talk to your pediatrician about anything going on with your baby that concerns you.
For example, it’s okay to say, “I’m not sure if I’m feeding her correctly. Could you help with that?”
Or, for example, “Could you share some resources about my baby’s development with me?

, This will help protect your baby from some potentially devastating diseases like measles, polio, and pertussis. Not only does getting your baby vaccinated on time support your baby’s development, it could also prevent your baby’s death.Ask your baby’s pediatrician for a copy of your baby’s immunization record.
Make sure that you keep appointments with your pediatrician so that you can stay current with your baby’s vaccination.
If you miss a schedule vaccination, talk to your baby’s pediatrician about rescheduling it as soon as possible.

, At each stage of your baby’s development there are different milestones, or things that your baby should be able to do. Knowing what to expect at each stage will help you support your baby’s development.Learning about milestones will also help you recognize any possible developmental delays early on.
Talk to your pediatrician about what milestones your baby should be reaching and how to help your baby reach them.
Check out books on infant and baby development from your local library to learn specific details about your baby’s developmental milestones.

, You won’t be able to support your baby’s development effectively if you are fatigued, sick, or depressed. Make sure you are doing things to support your own physical, mental, and emotional health.


Get some rest. Make sure you are getting enough sleep each night. If you need to, take a 20-minute nap during the day.
Eat healthy meals at regular times. It can be hard to stick to a meal schedule when you have a baby, but eating nutritious meals at regular times will give you the energy you need to support your baby’s development.
Be physically active. Supporting your baby’s development will take a lot of interaction, energy, and movement on your part.

Choose a substance to assist in removal.,
Hold the baby so the bandaged area is stationary and accessible.,
Apply the remover.,
Wait.,
Gently peel back the bandage to create a tab.,
Tug gently on the lifted area.,
Pull the bandage slowly off.,
Use lotion on the bandaged area.",How to Remove a Bandage from a Baby," There are many different substances you can use to make an adhesive bandage come off more easily. These substances lubricate the bandage and/or dissolve the adhesive. Choose one you have around the house, or purchase one. The following have been found to be effective:


VaselineBaby oil
Vegetable oilSalt water;
, Hold the baby still, or have a partner hold the child, so that you can easily access the bandage.

, Apply whichever substance you've chosen to remove the bandage. How you will apply it depends on which substance you've chosen.


If you are using Vaseline, take a pea-sized amount and rub it around and on the bandage with your finger.
If you are using an oil, soak a cotton swab and use it to cover the areas all around the bandage, especially the adhesive ends.If you are using salt water, mix up a teaspoon in a gallon of warm water and soak the entire area.
Sometimes simple warm water will do the trick. Giving the baby a bath may be enough to loosen the bandage so that it will come off easily (or even fall off in the tub)., Wait for several minutes while the removal substance soaks into the bandage. Be patient and give it plenty of time to work.

, Pick the side of the bandage that is most weakly adhered (the side that will be most likely to come off easily). Pull back gently with your index finger.


This small raised tab will give you better control when you remove the bandage.If neither side of the bandage comes loose easily, apply some more of whichever substance you've chosen and wait a little longer, then try again., The bandage should lift easily from the skin. If it doesn't, add some more of your adhesive remover along the exposed edge of the underside., Once the bandage is loose, pull it back gradually. It should come off easily at this point.If the bandage is still firmly adhered, you may not have waited long enough. Reapply and wait.

, If desired, rub cream or lotion over the formerly bandaged area as you remove it.This can make it come off even more easily.


This may also feel good for baby, hopefully eliminating any discomfort you may cause.

Babies thrive on routine, so it's not only ""okay"" it's desirable to have your one year old on some sort of schedule.,
Alternate times of stimulation with times of rest.,
Be sure their area is safe.,
Provide finger foods.,
If you want to expose your baby to good music, do it with a boom box and CDs to help them go to sleep.

,
Babies love to dance either alone or with you.,
Teach them smells.,
Repeat what they say.,
Say and See.,
Make sure the baby has time to determine their own play.,
Make sure your baby gets enough sleep.,
To really stimulate your baby, be very impressed when your baby is pleased with herself.,
Don't forget the value of failure and practice.,
Teach children age appropriate behavior, then let them do it!,
Skin stimulation is nice with a massage after bath, or just a gentle backrub during quiet time.,
Enjoy your 12 month old.",How to Stimulate a 12 Month Old's Senses,";
, This lets a baby's brain process what she or he has taken in.


All babies are different; some crave sitting in your lap and reading, others could not care less at this age. Offer an activity at several peaceful times and if the baby rejects it completely, go on to something they do like. Come back to the ignored activity in a few weeks.

, For gross motor stimulation, your baby is concentrating on learning to walk. Make sure the environment is a safe one: no sharp corners, and the like. Baby gates at tops and bottoms of stairs, that sort of thing. Babies this age also like ""tumbling"" with an adult, briefly being upside down (but safe), rolling them like a log across the floor. Dads love to toss babies in the air, and moms seem to hate it. Just beware of ceiling fans!


Riding toys powered by the baby's walking steps are great.

, For fine motor skills, nothing beats feeding. (Wash the baby's hands before eating!) Cheerios are great at helping a baby go from the raking grasp of a baby to the pincer grasp of a one year old. Let your baby feed herself with appropriate finger foods like cut up seedless grapes, banana bites, etc.


Shape sorters are also great for babies this age, as are the push toys like popcorn poppers.

,, As well, they like rhythm band toys like a tambourine (not that they'll play it in rhythm, but you never know).

, Smells are a big deal to babies, and are very primitive. Say the word, ""Tangerine"", break the tangerine piece underneath the baby's nose, and then let her eat the bite.

, Speech is well developed by one though most parents don't know that. Babies should be babbling and if not, get about 18 inches (45.7 cm) from their face and echo what they say. They know what they are talking about, even if you don't. And lose the pacifier except during nap and bedtime. You can't talk with your mouth plugged up. If your baby isn't making babbling sounds at 1 year, do bring it up with the pediatrician.

, Show your baby a bottle and say ""Bottle"" looking the baby right in the eye. If a parent has a big bushy beard, realize the baby isn't ""seeing"" how to say things!

, Babies don't need a mommy to play with them all the time. they need time to entertain themselves and do what is on their agenda.

, ""Free range"" children that never nap and go to bed at 11 pm usually aren't real happy campers and I'm not sure they learn as well as babies who keep to a sensible schedule. (sensible doesn't mean using a stopwatch).

, Clap and smile when she does (unless of course it is when she's thrown the cat into the bathwater and you have to get it out). Nothing succeeds like success.

, A little girl whose daddy was helping her get out of the swimming pool, said to him; ""I need to practice if I'm ever going to learn it, Daddy,"" she said, wanting to be independent. He wisely stood by and let her wrestle safely with the problem. He didn't abandon her, he stood by and cheered when she did it herself.

, A one year old can take off her socks. When you undress her, tell her to take off her socks. Don't do it for her. It might be faster that time, but your are trying to make her independent. Once a child has learned how to do a task, let them do it. Never do for a child what a child can do for herself (unless she's sick).

, And most babies love tickle time, no matter how old they are!

, They'll be grown in the blink of an eye.

Get your baby moving.,
Allow your baby to kick her legs and move her arms.,
Give her daily tummy time.,
Stretch her arms and legs.,
Prepare your baby for learning to walk.,
Crawl on all fours and encourage your baby to copy you.,
Encourage her to play with toys.,
Practice standing.,
Get ready for baby's first steps.,
Encourage her to stand on her own two feet as much as possible.,
Practice different types of movements.",How to Stimulate Gross Motor Skills in Infants," From being unable to lift up her head to being able to sit unsupported, your infant’s body undergoes tremendous changes during the first six months. This is an exciting time, and you should encourage your baby to move around as much as possible.


Give her a lot of opportunities to move. Engage her in fun games that will prod her to use her neck, chest, arms, and legs.
Use some of the ideas outlined in the steps below.;
, Free your baby from swaddling cloths; let her kick and wave about when she’s awake to strengthen her leg and arm muscles.


Put her under a mobile and let her kick and swat at the toys; the point is that she moves her body and not that she accurately hits any of the toys.

, When she is able turn on her tummy on her own, give your baby daily tummy time; this will strengthen her chest, neck, and arms in preparation for crawling.


Softly ring a bell one side at a time to make her look for and turn to the sound; you can do this when she is on her tummy or on her back.
Put a toy just a little bit out of her reach; say “come and get it” and wait for her to try wiggling or rolling towards it.

, Gently stretch her arms over her head and bend her knees towards her tummy for exercise.

, When a baby starts crawling, it means that her neck, arms, and legs are getting stronger. She is now preparing for the next stage of her development, which is walking.


Avoid rushing your child into learning to walk, and know that she will walk when she is ready.The best thing that you can do is to provide her with a safe environment to explore and to give her hours of crawling time.

, She will be wobbly at first (and might even plop down) but will master it soon enough. When she’s already a good crawler, pretend to chase her and let her crawl after you too. Other ideas include:


Set up a tunnel with a tent or a large box and let her crawl through it.
Roll a ball in front of her and make her chase after it.

, When your baby is seated, give her simple directions such as “give me your block”; this will make her turn her body while looking for the toy.


Withhold a toy when you are playing a passing game; this will make her lean towards you and strengthen her torso.
Surround her with several toys to encourage her to explore and move, especially towards those that are a bit far from her.

, Let your baby stand up while you support her under her arms and let her bounce up and down. This will strengthen her leg muscles.

, After months of crawling about, your baby will finally be ready to attempt her first steps. Don’t focus on getting her to walk right away, though.


Help your baby practice her balance and coordination. Then, when her leg muscles are up to the task of walking, she will be equipped to take confident steps.

, Resist putting your baby in a stroller or a sling; let her walk everywhere.


Let her cruise barefoot on the furniture; this will encourage her to walk on her own and is definitely more helpful than any kind of walker out there.
Instead of getting a walker with a seat, get a stable push toy that will act as her stabilizer.

, Give your baby some small balls or clean socks to shoot into a laundry basket; the act of bending down, picking up something, and standing up again is great for balance practice.


Play freeze dance to practice her inhibitory control or her ability to stop her body from moving.
Get a big soft ball and let her practice kicking it to each other, or sit on the floor and roll or throw a ball to each other.

Give your baby a tummy rub.,
Change your baby’s position.,
Lay your baby on her back and pedal her legs in the air as if she’s riding a bike.,
Try movement.",How to Soothe a Gassy Baby1," Rub gently in slow, clockwise circles. Your touch will help comfort the baby and move the gas along through the intestines.The intestines work in a clockwise direction, so that is the best direction in which to rub.
Don’t press hard. It shouldn’t be painful for the baby.;
, If air bubbles are stuck in your baby’s intestines, changing your baby's position can help them to become unstuck, and help your baby to pass them.If your baby was lying down, pick her up and hold her so she is sitting upright. You can walk around a bit. The movement may help the gas to move through her system.

Hold your baby in the football position with her stomach down. Some babies enjoy this position and the movement may free the trapped gas.
Place her facing downward with her belly across your lap. Gently move your legs to massage her abdomen. This slight pressure may help move the gas. You can also gently rub her back.

, If your baby’s belly is hard and bloated with gas, she may already be fidgeting, waving her arms, and kicking her legs.The movement may help get bubbles unstuck and move them through the intestines, so your baby can pass them naturally.
If your baby resists and does not want to have you pedal her legs, don’t force her.

, Movement will be comforting to the baby and may help her relax and pass the gas. There are several options:Rock the baby. Hold the baby in your arms and rock her back and forth. You can also try singing softly.
Try putting her in her car seat and going for a short drive around the block. The change of scenery and soft background noise of the motor may soothe her and cause her to fall asleep even though she’s gassy.
Put the baby in the stroller and go for a walk around the block. The movement and gentle bouncing of the stroller may help her to pass the gas.

Eliminate contact with contagious or sick individuals.,
Be aware of risk factors.",How to Spot Meningitis in Babies," The earliest symptoms of meningitis include vomiting, fever, and headaches. With babies, there are different ways to detect the signs and symptoms of meningitis since the baby cannot communicate their pain and discomfort to you with words. Symptoms can progress quickly between 3 to 5 days of initial infection. It is therefore important to get your baby to medical attention immediately.;
, Examine and lightly feel all around the baby's head for bulging and tense soft spots. The bulging soft spots will most likely appear on the sides of the baby's head in their fontanelle regions, which are gaps present in the baby's skull as their cranium continues to develop. ,,A bulging fontanelle is not always indicative of meningitis. Regardless of the possible causes, a bulging fontanelle is always an emergency and you must take your baby to an emergency room immediately. Some other conditions that cause a bulging fontanelle include:

Encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain, usually caused by an infection.
Hydrocephalus, caused by fluid buildup in the brain. This can happen because of an obstruction or narrowing of ventricles that help channel fluid out.
Increased intracranial pressure, caused by a build-up of fluid. This can restrict blood flow to the brain., Use an oral or rectal thermometer to check for fever. The baby may have a fever if the temperature is above 37.5ºC (99.5ºF).A very high temperature could be a sign of a medical emergency, depending on the baby's age:Under 3 months of age, always seek medical attention for a temperature above 38°C (100.4°F).
3–6 months: always seek attention for a fever above 39ºC (102.2ºF).
Older than 6 months: always seek attention for a fever above 40°C (104°F).
Do not rely solely on a high temperature to tell you that you should take the baby to an emergency room. Babies younger than three months with meningitis often have no fever., If your baby is ill, she will display irritability such as crying, moaning or thrashing. This may happen especially when you pick her up due to painful, achy muscles and joints. She may be quiet when she is stationary, but she will start crying loudly when picked up.Listen for changes in the baby's crying that may indicate pain or discomfort. The baby may whimper and moan excessively or emit cries that are higher than normal in pitch.The baby might also have pained or extreme crying when you cradle her or touch the neck area.
Bright light might also trigger crying due to photophobia., If you suspect meningitis, examine and watch the baby for signs of stiffness in her body, especially in her neck. The baby may not be able to touch her chest with her chin, and she may display jerky, abrupt movements., Take a look at the baby’s skin tone and complexion. You may observe skin that is extremely pale or blotchy, or it might have developed a bluish hue.Look for rashes that are pink, purple-red, or brown or develop rash clusters of pin-prick dots that resemble bruises.
If you are unsure whether the blotchy spots on the baby is a rash, you can verify by using the tumbler/glass test. This is done by gently pressing a clear drinking glass to the affected area of the skin. If the rash or red spots do not disappear because of the glass being pressed against the skin, the baby most likely has a rash. If you can see a rash through the clear glass, go to the emergency room immediately.If the baby has a darker complexion, a rash may be difficult to observe. In this case, look at areas such as the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, the stomach, or near the eyelids. These areas may also have what resembles red dots or pinpricks. , Your baby may not appear as hungry as usual. She may refuse to eat when you try to feed them and vomit anything they ingest., Look for signs of weakness. The baby may appear limp, lifeless, and tired or may appear sleepy constantly regardless of the rest they have received. This occurs as the infection spreads throughout the meninges., Observe the baby for irregular breathing patterns. The baby may breathe faster than normal or have difficulty breathing., Observe if the baby seems to have extreme, constant shivering and unusual coldness, especially on her hands and feet., Meningitis occurs when an infection causes the meninges or the tissue that lines your brain and spinal cord to become inflamed and swollen. The infection is usually due to certain bacterial or viral invasion into the baby's system. Causes of meningitis include:Viral: This is the number one cause of meningitis in the world, and it may resolve on its own. However, the baby still needs to be seen by a medical professional because the effects of the infection can be deadly if supportive care isn't provided. For children and babies, it is important for the parent or guardian to follow all immunization protocols. Mothers who are infected with herpes simplex virus or HSV-2 can transmit the virus to their baby during labor, if the mother has active genital lesions.,Bacterial: This type is common in newborns and babies.
Fungal: This type of meningitis is uncommon and usually affects AIDS patients as well as others who have compromised immune systems (e.g. transplant recipients and patients receiving chemotherapy).
Miscellaneous: Other types of meningitis may be chemical, drug, inflammatory and cancer.

, Describe all symptoms to your doctor, including ones that seem minor like sneezing or coughing. This will help your doctor distinguish between different types of meningitis, and move on to the appropriate diagnostic test. Tell the doctor about these severe symptoms immediately, as they may require emergency treatment:Seizures
Loss of consciousness
Muscle weakness

, There are several strains of bacteria that cause meningitis. If your baby has been exposed to people with a stomach illness or respiratory illness, he or she may have been exposed to any of these categories of bacteria:Strep B: In this category, the most common bacteria causing meningitis in babies under 24 months is strep agalactiae.
E Coli
Listeria species
Neisseria Meningitidis
S. Pneumoniae
Haemophilus Influenzae

, The doctor will take your baby’s vitals as well as her medical history. The doctor will take the baby’s temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.

, The doctor will draw blood from the baby in order to do a complete blood count. The doctor will take blood by poking a small hole in the baby’s heel.The complete blood count will examine electrolyte levels, as well as red and white blood cell counts. The doctor will also check blood coagulation and will check for bacteria in the blood.

, A cranial CT scan is a radiological test that checks the density of the brain to see if soft tissues are swollen or if any hemorrhaging has occurred. If patient has had a seizure or any trauma, a CT can help find this as well as indicate whether the patient can have the next test which is a lumbar puncture. If the patient has any indication of high intracranial pressure due to any of the previously mentioned indications, a lumbar puncture will not be initiated until pressure has decreased.

, This test extracts cerebrospinal fluid from the baby’s lower back. The fluid is needed to administer certain tests in order to determine the cause of the meningitis.


Be warned that this test is painful. The doctor will apply a topical anesthetic and use a large needle to pull fluid out between the bones of the patient's lower back.
If certain conditions are present, the doctor will not perform a lumbar puncture. These conditions may include:

Increased intracranial pressure or cerebral herniation (cerebral tissue shifting from its normal location)Infection at the site of lumbar puncture
Coma
Abnormalities of the spine
Difficulty breathing


If the lumbar puncture is necessary, the doctor will use the cerebrospinal fluid to administer tests, which may include:Gram stain: Once cerebrospinal fluid is removed, some of it will be stained with a dye in order to determine the type of bacteria present in the fluid.
Cerebrospinal fluid analysis: This test analyzes the fluid sample for cells, protein and glucose-to-blood ratio. This can help doctor correctly diagnose meningitis and differentiate each type of meningitis from one another.



, Meningitis is treated based on the type. Viral meningitis is treated depending on the viral cause.


For example, HSV-1 or herpes may be transmitted from mother to baby during labor if the mother has active genital lesions. Treatment for a newborn diagnosed with herpes encephalitis should be treated with an intravenous antiviral agent (for example, acyclovir administered intravenously).

, Bacterial meningitis is also treated based on the bacterial cause.Your doctor will identify this cause and give your child the appropriate treatment. Follow your doctor’s instructions for administering the treatment. Below are some suggested medications and dosages:Amikacin: 15-22.5 mg/kg/day every 8-12 hours
Ampicillin: 200-400 mg/kg/day every 6 hours
Cefotaxime: 200 mg/kg/day every 6 hours
Ceftriaxone: 100 mg/kg/day every 12 hours
Chloramphenicol: 75-100 mg/kg/day every 6 hours
Co-trimoxazole: 15 mg/kg/day every 8 hours
Gentamicin: 7.5 mg/kg/day every 8 hours
Nafcillin: 150-200 mg/kg/day every 4-6 hours
Penicillin G: 300,000-400,000 U/kg/day every 6 hours
Vancomycin: 45-60 mg/kg/day every 6 hours

, The duration of treatment for your baby’s meningitis depends on cause of meningitis.These are some estimated lengths of treatment:


N meningitides: 7 days
H. Influenza: 7 days
Strep pneumonia: 10 to 14 days
Group B. Strep: 14 to 21 days
Gram negative aerobic bacillus: 14 to 21 days
Listeria monocytogenes/L. meningitis: 21 days or more

, Give your baby care to ensure that she receives her proper dosages of medication throughout the entire course of treatment. She should also be encouraged to rest and consume lots of fluids. It is likely that an IV fluid will be provided due to her young age. She should also be prevented from transmitting meningitis to other family members.

, Hearing loss is the most common complication of meningitis. Therefore, all babies must have hearing evaluated post treatment through auditory evoked potentials studies., Post-treatment bacteria or other pathogens can remain and cause complications. One of these is increased intracranial pressure from a build-up of fluid between different compartments of the brain.All babies must undergo a follow up MRI 7 to 10 days after treatment for meningitis has ended.

, Be sure your child has had all vaccinations in order to reduce the chance of getting viral meningitis.


Reduce the risk of future children getting meningitis. If you are pregnant and you have HSV with genital lesions present, inform your doctor before delivery.

, Some forms of bacterial meningitis are contagious. Keep young children and babies away from contact with contagious or sick individuals.

, Some people may be at higher risk for contracting meningitis, depending on certain circumstances. Some of these include: Age: Children under five years old may be at higher risk for viral meningitis. Adults over the age of 20 may be at higher risk for bacterial meningitis.
Living in close quarters: When people live in close contact with many other people, such as dormitories, military bases, boarding schools and child care facilities, they may be at increased risk of meningitis.
Decreased immune system: People with compromised immune systems may have a higher risk of contracting meningitis. AIDS, alcoholism, diabetes, and use of immunosuppressant drugs can compromise immune systems.

Ask your doctor about over-the-counter medications for gas.,
Discuss probiotics with your doctor.,
Consult your doctor before trying any alternative medicines.,
Give your baby a soothing bath.,
Take your baby to the emergency room if there are signs of a problem more serious than gas.",How to Soothe a Gassy Baby2," Though there are medications made especially for babies with gas, it is generally a good idea to discuss them with your doctor, to make sure that they will be okay for your baby.Babies who need thyroid replacement medications should not take these medications.
Over-the-counter medications usually contain simethicone (St. Joseph Baby Infants’ Gas Relief, Infants’ Mylicon Gas Relief)
Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.

, Probiotics are supplements that are supposed to help people develop and maintain healthy communities of bacteria in their digestive tract. When the balance of bacteria is not right, it can lead to digestive problems, including gas. But the scientific evidence for giving it to babies is mixed and many doctors do not recommend it.Some studies have found that probiotics decrease colic in babies. If your baby is crying because of gas due to colic, the probiotics may help the colic and, by extension, the gas. But other studies have not found them to be helpful.
Your doctor will be able to give you recommendations based on the latest scientific evidence and your baby’s particular health needs.

, Herbal remedies and supplements are not quality-controlled by the government the way commercial medications are. This means that the doses in them may not be standardized or they may be contaminated with low amounts of harmful chemicals. For a small baby, even a little bit could be dangerous. However, if your doctor gives you the OK, you might try soothing your baby with:Herbal tea. Use decaffeinated tea so your baby won’t be awake all night.
Sugar water. While it may seem like sugar water couldn’t possibly be harmful, ask your doctor if giving it to your baby might interfere with breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. Use an eye-dropper to administer very small amounts.
Gripe water. Talk to your pediatrician about using this formula, which usually includes ingredients such as fennel, caraway, ginger, dill, chamomile, and peppermint. Avoid formulations that contain alcohol or sodium bicarbonate., A warm bath with a few drops of chamomile or lavender oil may help relax and soothe your baby.

, These symptoms usually indicate that the baby might be sick and in need of medical care. Symptoms to watch for include:

Fever
Stomach that is bloated, swollen, hard, or tender
Bloody stool or stool with mucus
Vomiting (especially forcefully, or with a green or dark color or blood)
Diarrhea
Reduced hunger
Limp skin
Pale skin
Inability to suck

Evaluate your bottle feeding technique.,
Talk to your baby’s doctor about whether your baby might be allergic to cow’s milk in the formula.,
Consult your baby’s doctor about whether your baby might be allergic to something in your breast milk.",How to Soothe a Gassy Baby3," Many babies swallow air when they cry. If your baby tends to cry often, pick her up and comfort her as quickly as possible.

Some babies are very sensitive and may not be able to soothe themselves without help from a parent.
You can help prevent your baby from swallowing air when crying by holding her when she’s upset and helping her to calm down.

, This will reduce the amount of air she swallows. During all holds keep the baby's head above her stomach and support her head. This will help her swallow properly. Common positions are:The side-lying hold, where mom and baby are lying tummy to tummy on the bed with the baby's head at the mom's breast.
The football hold, where mom is upright and holds the baby like football with her feet in mom's armpit and her head at the breast on the same side.
The cross-cradle hold, where mom holds the baby like a football, but nurses the other breast.
The cradle hold, where the baby's head is supported by mom's elbow and her body lies across mom's forearm.

, If your baby is particularly gassy, you can interrupt the feeding a few times in the middle to burp her. You can burp your baby in a few different positions:

Sit upright and hold the baby to your chest. Allow your baby's chin to rest on your shoulder as you gently pat her back.
Hold your baby sitting upright. Support her head by cradling her chin with one hand, and use the other to pat her back.
Place your baby on her belly across your lap. Make sure the baby's head is still higher than her chest. Gently pat her on the back.

, There are a few simple changes that may help enormously if your baby swallows air during bottle feeding.

Hold the bottle high enough that the nipple stays full. If the nipple is only partially full with milk, the baby will suck in air with the milk.
Try a different bottle or a different nipple on the bottle. Your baby might not swallow as much air when drinking from a bottle with a disposable, collapsible bag.

, Though it’s rarer in babies than in adults, some babies are allergic to cow’s milk, or intolerant of it. These babies often do much better on formulas which are easier to digest. If formula was causing your baby’s gas, you should see improvement in about two days. Possible formulas to try include:Similac Expert Care Alimentum
Nutramigen
Pregestimil

, If your baby might have a genetic predisposition to allergies, stopping eating these foods might help relieve your baby’s gas. It may take a few weeks before you notice a reduction in your baby’s gas. Possible allergens include:Dairy
Peanuts
Tree nuts
Wheat
Soy
Fish

Prevent tooth decay by feeding your baby a healthy diet.",How to Soothe a Teething Baby," If your baby is teething, sometimes simply applying pressure can relieve some of the pain. Rub a clean finger over your baby's gums. If you're not comfortable using your finger, you can also use a moistened gauze pad., Keeping your baby's mouth cool can relieve some of the pain of teething. You can use a variety of cool substances to cool off your baby's gums and mouth.


You can use a cold wash cloth, a cold spoon, or a slightly chilled teething ring to help your baby feel better.While cold substances can help, anything frozen can be bad for your baby's health. Contact with extremely cold temperatures can be harmful to the mouth and gums. Use your refrigerator instead of your freezer when cooling off silverware or teething rings., You can purchase a teething device online or at a local drug store. Teething devices can be traditional teething rings, which are small plastic devices babies can chew on when their gums are bothering them. You can also buy teething blankets, which can be more convenient. Some teething devices vibrate to massage the gums and add extra relief., If your baby is old enough to eat solid foods, harder foods can help. Your baby can chew or gnaw on harder food items, such as peeled cucumbers or carrots or teething biscuits, and the pressure can provide pain relief.Keep a close eye on your baby if you give him hard foods, or place the hard foods in a mesh feeding bag approved for this use. You want to make sure he does not choke., Babies tend to drool a lot when teething. If excessive drool dries on your baby's mouth, it can cause skin irritation. Make sure to wipe off any drool you see with a clean towel.A water or cream-based lotion can be applied around your baby's mouth. This can also help prevent her skin from drying out due to drool.In the event a drooling rash does occur, place a cloth under the bed sheet while she sleeps. You should also rub some baby lotion or ointment around her mouth and cheeks before bed.If drooling is a common problem, consider a bib to catch drool as it falls.

, If home remedies aren't helping, there are a variety of over-the-counter medications designed for use on teething babies. Consider giving your baby painkillers if his teething is really bothering him.


Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Children's Motrin) can be helpful for a teething baby. It might be a good idea to run this by your baby's doctor first to ask about dosage and any safety precautions you should take.Do not give ibuprofen to babies under 6 months of age.
Avoid any medications that contain benzocaine, a common pain reliever. In rare cases, this can cause a serious condition that reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood.You should have your baby evaluated by a doctor before administering any medication if teething is severe. You want to make sure the pain is caused by teething and not an undetected underlying condition, like an ear infection., You can buy teething gels at a local pharmacy or supermarket if your baby does not respond to other treatments. Gels usually contain a local antiseptic or anesthetic. Use a sugar-free gel specifically recommended for babies. Gels usually wash away with a baby's saliva, so the effects might not last long. Talk to your doctor before using any gels.Avoid teething gels with benzocaine and make sure not to use teething gels more than recommended.

, Many parents use homeopathic methods to treat teething. While some of these methods may be relatively harmless, there is little scientific evidence to back up claims of effectiveness. Certain types of homeopathic methods may be harmful to your baby.


Homeopathic powders or granules, sold by many pharmacies, are relatively harmless as long as they're sugar-free. However, most evidence regarding their effectiveness is anecdotal. If your baby is not responding to other treatments, you may want to try such powders but know there is no guarantee they will work.Some stores sell amber bracelets or necklaces which supposedly aid with teething pain by releasing a small amount of oil into the baby's skin. You should take extreme caution if you decide to try this method. Bracelets and necklaces both carry a choking risk for a small child. Babies may also suck or chew on such devices, and dislodged beads also carry a choking risk. There is no scientific evidence that shows amber is effective during teething pain., Teething is usually a normal part of a baby's growth and development. It can be handled at home without a doctor's assistance. However, if your baby develops a fever or seems particularly uncomfortable, she may have developed an infection or illness. Make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible., When your baby's first tooth arrives, he should see a dentist. Make an appointment no more than 6 months after the first tooth develops but before your baby's 1st birthday. Your dentist will check to make sure the baby's teeth are coming in healthy and strong., As your baby's teeth come in, take efforts to care for them. Healthy teeth and gums are important for your baby's overall health.


Wash your baby's gums with a clean, damp washcloth each day. This will prevent bacteria from building up.Switch to a soft-bristled toothbrush as your baby's first teeth begin to appear. Your child will not learn to spit until the age of three. Before this, use only a small bit of fluoride toothpaste that is approved for babies or children. It should be no bigger than a grain of rice., As your baby begins to transition to eating solid foods, provide her with healthy, low-sugar options. Always brush your baby's teeth after she eats. Minimize feeding her milk during the night and avoid letting her suck on a bottle at night or putting juice or other sugared drinks in a bottle."

Test a few options before you buy a batch of cloth diapers.,
All-in-one diapers (AIOs) are most like disposables.,
Use pre-fold diapers for simplicity.,
Try a pocket cloth diaper for extra protection against wetness.,
Use a fitted cloth diaper.,
Remember that a newborn requires 10 to 12 changes per day, and older infants and toddlers will need 8 to 10 changes.

,
Pay attention to sizing.,
Think about how often you want to wash diapers.,
Buy necessary accessories.,
Consider using your cloth diapers for other things.,
Change your baby as soon as you notice she is wet or soiled.

,
Remove a wet diaper and place it in a diaper pail for washing.,
Allow your baby's bottom to air dry.,
Remove a soiled diaper and clean the baby's bottom with a soft damp wipe, consider buying a wipe warmer which is perfect for storing cloth wipes.,
Remove any diaper inserts, such as a soaking pad, before you wash them.

,
Start your wash cycle with a cold rinse (to prevent staining and rise out pee.),
PUL covers need to be air dried.,
Wool covers must be hand washed in cold water, and air dried.

",How to Use Cloth Diapers," They come in different forms and features.;
, They are made with the absorbent cloth inside next to your babies skin, and a PUL cover attached to the outside.

, These are rectangular in shape and divide by length into 3 sections.


Follow the divisions that show you how to fold, and use a Diaper safety pin, or a snappi (stretchy plastic T shaped thing with teeth) to hold the diaper together, or place a diaper cover that snaps over it.

, This type of diaper has a waterproof exterior and a pocket where you put the insert.


Shop for extra inserts (also called soakers) that will fit any diaper size. These provide the baby with extra protection for nap and nighttime.

, Perfect for nighttime because the front, back, and side tabs hold pee where any other type of diaper does not. They usually fasten with snaps or Velcro, and are easy to take on and off. Fitted diapers need a cover.


Place a diaper cover over a fitted cloth diaper, flat or prefold diaper to keep them from leaking.
Wool diaper covers are great for nighttime use also instead of a PUL cover. Just be sure to read about washing and applying lanolin to waterproof them.

,, Many brands offer a ""one-size"" diaper that will fit after the newborn stage until potty training. One-size diapers save much more money than buying cloth diapers in many different sizes.

, If you want to wash every 2 or 3 days, buy enough cloth diapers to keep your clean supply well stocked. Never leave dirty diapers unwashed for more than 3 days.

, Such as diaper covers, extra inserts, Diaper liners (reusable, or disposable make cleaning poo much easier!) Snappies or pins, cloth diaper safe rash cream, a pail or bucket with a lid to store the dirty diapers.

, Some parents also use them for burp cloths, bibs and changing pads.

,,


Rinse the wet diaper before placing it in the pail if you prefer. While this is not necessary, some parents prefer to rinse it out before placing it a pail to eliminate the odor of urine.

, If you want, you can use a wet or dry wipe to clean the diaper area.

,


Shake solids into the toilet and flush. Rinse the diaper and place it in the diaper pail for washing. If your baby is having only breast milk, there is no need to rinse or dump because breast milk will be broken down in the wash waster.
Scrape unformed poop into the toilet with a spatula or other tool that is set aside for this specific purpose. Rinse the diaper to remove as much poop as you can, and place the diaper in the pail for washing.

,, Then add a small amount of laundry soap to a hot wash (too much soap will cause build up, and your diaper will leak.) It helps to do an extra rinse to make sure there is no extra soap left in your diapers.

, Anything else can be dried in the dryer.

Swaddle your baby.,
Try a baby swing.,
Take them for a ride.,
Put baby on top of the washing machine or dryer.,
Turn on a loud home appliance.,
Jiggle the infant on your lap.,
Try a more calm and quiet approach if jiggling doesn't work.",How to Soothe a Baby Who Has Colic1," They won't like the process, but the results can be amazing. Swaddling recreates the coziness of the womb, and may enhance the calming impact of other soothing steps.Once swaddled, turn baby on their side and jiggle them. Shush them loudly - make sure they can hear you over their own screaming. Think about how loud the vacuum cleaner is — that's the kind of volume it might take to get their attention.;
, The recurring motion may soothe your shrieking baby and get them to stop crying, at least briefly.While it’s tempting to let a crying baby sleep anywhere they please, experts recommend not letting babies sleep in swings, carriers, car seats, etc. — try to get them to sleep in a safe, secure crib.

, Driving, strolling, or even carrying your baby around may provide some relief to both of you. Some people swear by car rides as a colic remedy -- bundle the baby up, buckle them in, and within ten minutes in the car, their cries might be quieted.Or, if you prefer fresh air and exercise, going for walks with a baby carriage can also work.
If you have tasks or chores to do, try using a baby sling or carrier that holds the baby close to your body, yet leaves both hands free as you walk around the house.

, The vibrations can be calming to a baby. Secure the baby properly in a car seat or a baby bouncer.Do not ever leave your baby on a washing machine or dryer unattended.

, Try the vacuum cleaner. It sounds odd, but many parents swear it works. Just set the baby in the bassinet or car seat and let them become fascinated by a sound louder than they're making.Or, turn on a floor fan or window air conditioner. Make sure it’s an older, roaring type, not some new whisper-quiet model.
You might also want to invest in a sound machine that mimics a mother's heart beat (or makes other white noise sounds). This can be a lifesaver for both parent and child.

, Lay the baby on their stomach across your knees — but remember to support the head at all times. Jiggle your feet up and down and pat softly. This vibration can be very soothing., Instead of over-stimulating your baby's senses, see if reducing external stimulation works. Lie on your back in a quiet, dark place. Hold the baby firmly on your chest with their head over your heart. Raising your knees with your feet flat on a solid surface, rock yourself, calming the infant."
"
Lay the child or toddler needing to be changed on their back, gently onto the changing surface.,
Spread all of your fingers of your right hand fully apart.

,
Place your fingers of your right hand onto the child's ankle's on their legs.,
Grab the other leg with your ring and pinkie fingers.,
Raise both legs by pushing the legs into the air.,
Push the legs of the child up in the direction of near the child's face.,
Lower the child's legs when you feel set to lower them.",How to Use the Ankle‐Hold Technique to Lift the Child's Legs During a Diaper Change," Make sure their legs are completely extended and spread slightly apart.;
,, The space between your index finger and middle finger should be holding onto the child's right leg (the leg that is on your left, if facing the child). Continue holding this leg with these fingers as you move the leg over so you can grab the other leg.

, Hold both of those legs together using these fingers. You should now have an empty space between your middle finger and index finger, and by now, should now be holding both legs.

, These two legs should be done simultaneously, since you're already holding both simultaneously.

, Keep their legs straight though. The legs won't bend so far as to reach their face, and may break if you even try this method.

, (i.e. Lower the child's legs once the changing pad has been set down underneath them, or the diaper has been placed underneath them.)

"
Use the “colic carry.” Hold your baby stomach down, with their abdomen resting on your forearm.,
Massage your baby’s midsection.,
Pedal their legs.,
Give the baby a warm bath or sponge bath.,
Change the mother and the baby's diets.,
Provide something soothing to suck.,
Try a traditional baby stomach-ease tea.,
Give a rectal catheter a shot.",How to Soothe a Baby Who Has Colic2," Support their head securely, either with your palm or the crook of your elbow. Walk around, or try rocking the baby back and forth, either very gently or a bit more quickly (but without sudden jerks or whipping motions)., While employing the “colic carry” or with the baby stomach-down on your legs, try massaging their middle and lower back. This may help relieve gas, and can provide soothing comfort regardless.You can also try massaging their stomach while they are being held or are lying face-up. Use circular motions, as if trying to nudge the trapped gas upward or downward., While your baby lies on their back, lift their legs and gently mimic the up-and-down motion of a bicyclist pumping the pedals. This alternating motion may help release gas pressure that could be contributing to their colic cries., Just as a warm soak can soothe your stress, it may help your baby as well. Wipe your infant down with a soft washcloth dipped in warm (not hot) water, or add some comfortably warm water to a baby tub for a calming bath.Never leave a baby alone in or near a bath, no matter how little water is in the tub.
Always check the water temperature yourself to prevent scalding.

, Despite the mystery that still surrounds colic, it may be related to the ongoing development of an infant’s digestive system. Some foods that the mother eats — e.g. spicy foods, or potential allergens — may transfer to the breast milk and cause additional discomfort. Try avoiding a single type of food for three days or so, and see if baby shows any signs of improvement; if not, try another.Adverse reactions to milk or soy might also be related to colic symptoms, so if you are giving your baby formula that is milk-based, you may want to try soy-based for a week to see if that helps (or vice versa).
Talk to the pediatrician about formula and food recommendations.

, If baby begins to calm down slightly, try giving them something to suck on, like a pacifier or your finger. Gradually reduce the jiggling, shushing, etc. as they calm. If you’re lucky, baby will drift off to sleep as you place them in their crib., Herbs like fennel, chamomile, and thyme have been used for generations to give colic relief. A spoon before and after every feeding might help. Look for recipes online.


Always consult your baby’s doctor first, however; don’t assume that “traditional” equals “always safe.” For instance, star anise is typically discouraged now because it may introduce potentially dangerous toxins., It may seem crazy, but using a rectal catheter like the Windi might relieve your baby of painful gas that could be contributing to the colic cries. The catheter reaches past the cramped muscles of the baby and releases the pent up gas.

Used properly (e.g., not inserted more than intended), the product should be as safe as a typical rectal thermometer. But you may want to consult your baby's doctor first.
Even if it is probably harmless, there's little evidence that it will actually help. Unfortunately, this is the case for most presumed colic remedies."
"
Take quick breaks for your own mental health.,
Rely on your support system for longer breaks.,
Get help before you reach a breaking point.",How to Soothe a Baby Who Has Colic3," If you simply cannot get your baby to stop crying, remember that it’s okay to step away for a moment. Place the baby in a safe spot (e.g. their crib), and take a minute to read a book, listen to music, or meditate.Leave the room if you must, but don’t leave for too long, as a feeling of abandonment will only make the crying worse.

, If you need more than a short break, call someone you trust to take over for an hour or two. If you have a spouse or other caregivers available, take shifts so no one gets burned out.Remember — you are not a bad parent just because you need to take a break for yourself.

, If your despair reaches a level in which you fear you might hurt yourself or your child, call for help right away.

Prepare a fresh clean diaper.,
Collect a small cupful of a liquid (either water or some real urine) in a disposable cup.,
Dribble a small to moderate stream of the liquid into the bedwetting diaper.,
Re-situate the diaper in your hand.,
Hold the diaper in the palm of your hand, touching only the center bottom portion of the diaper.,
Pinch the back side of the diaper between any two of your fingers in a consecutive line.,
Squeeze the diaper.,
Ask yourself Do you see any water spewing out from it?,
Give this diaper an even tighter squeeze.,
Represent extreme forces given in the case of an accident in the diaper.,
Dispose of the disposable bedwetting diaper into the nearest trashcan.

",How to Test a Bedwetting Diaper to Ensure It Won't Leak Prior to First Use," Take out and open up a fresh clean diaper from the diaper package. Prepare the elastic siderail cuffguards (more often called/nicknamed leakguards). Make sure that the sides of the diaper aren't stuck together or stuck to the diaper itself.;
, As long as the item you can pour is a liquid, you can choose whatever you feel like using. However, for availability, tap water works wonders. You will need quite a bit of this liquid, so collect about 2-3 cups worth for estimating the amount of a potentially heavy-wetting situation(you never want to assume a light situation, as most don't recognize they've wet until it's too heavy and saggy). Think in terms of heavy accident quantity-equivalents when estimating how much you'll need to use to perform the task - so the more, the better!

, Do not let any of the liquid cross-contaminate the outside edge of the diaper or become lost in the process when pouring instead. If you can reach the hand that is holding the cup down into the crevices of the diaper (to get a more-precise aim with the liquid without causing your hands to get super-dirty and gross), try to pour it directly onto the entire containment zone inside the diaper

, Hold one of your hands in an open position and flat and position your fingers tightly together(almost as if you were asking someone nearby for money). You're hands need to be applying firm pressure but able to squeeze the diaper for several seconds. The diaper will be waterlogged and some may potentially leak out a little. If the diaper is so waterlogged that it spews the liquid out the diaper's external sides (sometimes called the diaper's leakguards), this diaper might not last on most wearers and you'll have to discard this diaper.

, Walk over towards a toilet or another water-absorbent object you can squish the diaper out to be. Your hand must be almost or completely flat. Make sure the back side of the diaper is facing your hand.

, Hold it by the diaper's waistline portion as close as you can by only your one hand, as you'll need to use the other hand for another part of the task that must be performed at exactly the same time.

, Wrap your hand to form a cup-styled figure around the bottom edge of the diaper, and squeeze the diaper tight. Do not squeeze it so tight that you see any of the gel materials squeeze out from it, as it will be losing valuable pieces to the absorption item which will negate part of the qualitative answer you'll receive in the end.

, Although all diapers aren't supposed to spew any of the accident water when squeezed, if you notice it spewing when you squeeze, you'll potentially realize that either you are squeezing too hard or the diaper isn't built to handle as much liquid as you poured into the diaper, and thereby it would leak if a heavy accident in the diaper were to occur. (If you decided to go with the ""real"" urine route, you can wash your hands immediately after this project is done).

, Roll the diaper into a tight ball starting at the area where you squeezed the diaper. Roll this diaper over into a two-ply form. It may or may not trickle out the sides. If it does trickle out the sides, this diaper brand isn't worthy to be used. Cheap bedwetting diaper companies aren't going to hold urine as well as the popular name brand ones (such as Huggies Goodnites or Pampers Underjams) and therefore will potentially trickle excess urine out the sides of the diaper (thereby getting the bed full of excess liquid the diaper couldn't hold).

, When you roll the diaper up, if after rolling the diaper less it doesn't trickle out any liquid, this may be a pliable temporary diaper to use. Imagine what would happen when the user rolls around quite a lot in bed with the soaking wet diaper on. With enough force, the diaper may end up getting super-squished into configurations the diaper wasn't made to hold up to. Great diapers will either only trickle out a few drops, or not drop out any excess water at all.

Clean your Diaper Genie® weekly.,
Invest in a deodorizing filter.",How to Use a Diaper Genie," The first step in assembling your Diaper Genie® is to attach the top (piece A) and bottom (piece B) of the genie together. There is a hinge on the bottom of piece A and a bar at the top of piece B. While holding the top at a 45 degree angle, place the bar from piece B into the hinge and press down until they click together., After securing the hinge between the top and bottom of your Diaper Genie®, flip the top over the bottom of the genie and press down until they click together. At this point, your genie should look like a tall, slim cylinder., You will need to place the plastic liner in your genie in order to use it. To add a new refill, pull the tab on the refill to remove the plastic seal. Then, pull downwards until you’ve released about 18 inches of film (or enough to fill the bottom of the Diaper Genie®). Tie a knot in the bottom of the liner.An overhand knot works best for securing the bottom of your liner., Finally, place your liner refill in the top of your Diaper Genie® and push the knot you’ve tied down, through the clamp. Close the lid on your Diaper Genie®. You’re now ready to start using it., After you’ve changed your baby, roll their diaper up tightly, securing it with the adhesive tape on the diaper. It is best to roll your diaper into an oblong shape or a small, round bundle.The tighter you can wrap your dirty diapers, the more the Diaper Genie® will hold before needing to empty it.
Do not leave the adhesive tape unsecured because this can attach to the liner in your genie, causing it to rip.
Generally, the Diaper Genie® will hold approximately 34 newborn diapers at one time. This number will decrease as your child ages., Once you have rolled your dirty diaper, lift the lid of the Diaper Genie® and insert the diaper. Push the dirty diaper all the way down through the clamp. Ensure that the clamp closes again after you have inserted the diaper. Once you have done this, close the lid.Once the clamp closes, the Diaper Genie® twists the film directly under the clamp, sealing the dirty diaper at the top., Once your Diaper Genie® is full, unhinge the top from the bottom by pushing the button located in the middle of the genie (where the top and bottom parts meet). Flip the top part over, revealing the built-in cutter mechanism on the inside., After you have unhinged the top and revealed the childproof cutter on the genie, pull the liner into the cutter mechanism and press down until it severs the liner. Tie a knot at the top to enclose your diapers in the liner.


Ensure you leave enough room at the top of your diaper roll to tie a knot—usually three or four inches., Once you have tied the top of your liner, lift the full bag out and dispose of the dirty diapers wherever you dispose of your garbage outside., Once you have removed the full liner, be sure to tie a knot at the start of the new liner. If you fail to do so, the dirty diapers you place in the genie will fall out the bottom of the liner when you go to remove the next full load., After tying a knot at the end of the liner you have just cut, pull out about 18 inches of liner, like you did when you were preparing to use your Diaper Genie® for the first time. Ensure that the amount you pull out is enough to fill the bottom of the pail., Finally, flip the top of the Diaper Genie® back over so it is sitting atop the bottom of the genie. Press down until the two parts click back into place., As you can imagine, you will need to clean your Diaper Genie® routinely to keep germs and any lingering smell from your child’s dirty diapers to a minimum. The best way to do this is to clean your genie at least once a week. To do so, take the Diaper Genie® apart and wipe down both the inside and outside with a bleach-based solution.


If you’d like to be more thorough, wipe the genie down with an anti-bacterial cleaning wipe several times throughout the week.
Furthermore, whenever you change the liner in your Diaper Genie®, spray the inside with a disinfecting and odor-neutralizing spray., The Diaper Genie® doesn’t come with a built-in deodorizer, but investing in one is a good way to help reduce the daily odor from your child’s dirty diapers. You can find deodorizing carbon filters for your Diaper Genie® at nearly all general merchandise retailers, like Walmart or Target. These filters come with a case that attaches to the lid of your Diaper Genie® and several individual carbon filters. To use, simply unlatch the top of the case, place a filter inside, and snap the case closed.


Filters should be replaced at least every 90 days for the best results."

Reserve disposable diaper use only for times when you can't be at your residence.,
Purchase recycled and unbleached disposable diapers.,
Look for reusable diapers that are a cross between disposable convenience and cloth diapers.,
Avoid perfumed or colored diapers.,
Dump the feces in the toilet.",How to Use Disposable Diapers in an Environmentally Friendly Way," It can be handy to have disposable diapers available when overflowing messes could spoil your baby's comfort during the whole outing.;
, Look in health food stores for a good organic choice.

, These are made from cloth and sometimes plastic components. They will often require the use of a disposable liner. They're a good in-between compromise for some moms.

, Anything added to diapers on top of their already extensive energy use is just cosmetic and unnecessary. Moreover, these additions can harm your baby when they're not clearly disclosed and you don't know what they are.

, Do not leave it for the garbage; the viruses in feces can impact from people in the household to the collector through to landfill. Keep a special feces scraper on hand and wash it thoroughly after each use. Wash your own hands thoroughly each time too.

Look at the package to see what gender the specific bedwetting diaper is for.,
Take a diaper from the package and unfurl it.,
Try the diaper on.,
Look at the wearer's comfort level when wearing them for size.,
Look for itchy spots, as the wearer begins to wear them for a few moments.,
Try to move the bedwetting diaper around on the wearer's waist.,
Don't pull the diaper down off the wearer.,
Have an intentional ""accident"" in them.,
Let the wearer lay down on their bed and make them think in terms of wearing the diaper and seeing if the size of the diaper's core during and after a bedwetting accident and whether or not it will still move on the wearer.

,
See if the wearer still feels like the fit is still perfect, even after the diaper puffs up from sapping up the water from the accident.,
Don't soil the diaper too, unless you see that the wearer is also having soiling accidents in these diapers too.",How to Test Out a Bedwetting Diaper to Ensure a Proper Fit Before First Use," Sometimes companies have been known to make one type of bedwetting diaper strictly for boys and one type of bedwetting diaper strictly for girls, and the proper fits can be different for boys than girls and definitely have different zones of absorption which can affect the space between organs in the bedwetting diaper area. However, don't try to urinate into them at first.;
, Inspect different parts of the diaper.

Unlike children's diapers, bedwetting diapers never have tape. They are self sealing between the two sides, which is made at the company by a sewn-together process where both the front extensions and back sides are sewn together on both the wearer's left and right sides.

, Look for ease of use when pulling the diaper up and down the wearer's legs. Are they easy to put on and take off? Do they slide around when the wearer pulls them up?, Do they tend to slide around the wearer when they wear them? When the wearer twists and twirls, do they follow by loosely twirling with them, or do they tend to stay firm around the wearer's waist and not move around too much?

, Are there any spots that make the wearer feel itchy when they wear them or put them on? Great diapers shouldn't ever feel itchy for more than a few seconds, or that make the wearer feel uncomfortable to wear

, Great bedwetting diapers won't be able to be twisted or moved over a long distance. If they are able to be adjusted, it shall take a greater force to move and twist them to get a perfect fit on the wearer. Poorly-made diapers which slide without much movement, meaning they have unequal amounts of gel located in the wrong areas, may cause an improper fit. Think in terms of the movements a bedwetter could commonly make when rolling around in bed., Test to see if you can feel the center core of the diaper and see if it feels flexible for the wearer to wear or not. Stick two fingers into the bedwetting diaper's core. See if you can feel the center to edge of the core section of the bedwetting diaper. The core must be fairly thick and well padded, but not so much padded that no fingers can fit, and not so little padded that all 5 fingers can fit into the diaper being worn.

, See if the center core area can hold up to the bedwetting accident that was intentionally made to ensure it can't weigh the wearer down and make for an improper fit. Great diapers won't sag too much after an accident, and still provide for a proper fit. Good diapers will allow the diapers to come off, but not enough if the person accidentally moves around with the wet ones still on, hold the accident in without weighing the wearer down. Do these bedwetting diapers sag or pull with enough force that it makes it hard to stay standing up? Cheap bedwetting diapers tend to make it hard for the person to walk around let alone lay down in their bed, and only make the wearer want to have their diapers changed more often during the night. You can use tap water to test it out.,, Only the wearer can tell if they still fit as good as they did a few moments ago. However, to see if the wearer is honestly telling the truth, stick your fingers down into the bedwetting diaper's core area again, and see if you can feel the space between the core and the wearer's skin. You should still be able to move your fingers comfortably around in them without too much force. If you see that you are able to get three or more centimeters worth of space between them at the tip of the core where the wetness is found, you'll realize that it can assure you of a proper fit before, during or after your bedwetting accident.

, Most bedwetters don't soil their diapers during and after a bedwetting accident at night, so soiling tests shouldn't need to be done to ensure a proper fit with the wearer. Although geared to protect the wearer in all cases, most bedwetting diapers won't protect the wearer too much from soiling accidents as much as a regular disposable diaper would have done to the wearer."

, Don't risk an injury by keeping both children in the diaper-changing area at the same time.

, Don't allow the other to awaken unless you need to be at a certain place at a certain time which may be closing in on you sooner than you think. Time spent in any one location away from home may or may not be convenient and needed, but some things must take precedence over other activities (doctors appointments take precedence over bringing children to daycare or schooling and having to deal with diapers can be put off for a few extra minutes).

, While toddlers might have learned to control some of their actions and have had a little more time to realize that their wiggling needs to stop during changing times, infants and babies (and especially newborns) need special care.

, Make your presence known, but keep wandering eyes off of issues beyond others' controls from reacting from both child's diapers.

, They should be able to make life easy for you so you can do other things after the diaper change is complete so life can roll forward as normal.

Decide whether you are going to use disposable diapers or cloth ones.,
Buy disposable change mat covers which are possibly an unnecessary expense, but can be invaluable if you feel you won't have time to wipe the change mat down after each use.

,
Purchase diapers, wipes or baby lotion and cotton balls if you prefer, diaper rash cream (used proactively to prevent diaper rash), and don't forget you will also need hand sanitizer.,
Look for a trash can that can be placed underneath the changing table/nearby.,
Have one or two diaper pails to hold the dirty diapers until you scrape and wash them.

,
Some items which are not essential, but which a lot of people like to have, include: baby powder, massage oil, a diaper hanger, and a mobile to keep baby occupied whilst being changed.

",How to Stock a Changing Table," This will determine what kind of things you are going to need.;
,,


Diaper changing items (above) can be stored in a number of ways depending on the size and style of your change table. Some come equipped with pockets, or else use a plastic container, basket etc. and slide it underneath your change table.

, Some people like to have a trash can next to the change table. Whether or not you choose to have this, have some scented diaper bags (you can get them very cheap) to put the used diapers in. If you do get a trash can, get one with a lid, this will help to prevent your house smelling of old diapers!

You can also purchase a diaper pail from your local baby store that keeps your home smelling good without having to purchase bags.

Heat water in a pot or kettle.,
Carefully pour the steaming water over the PUL exteriors.,
Re-wash your diapers and inserts in the washing machine without detergent.,
Dry the diapers.",How to Strip Cloth Diapers by Boiling," Newborn diapers probably won't have any removable waste, since breast milk stools are water soluble and formula stools are too fluid to shake off. Older babies and toddlers on solid foods will have more solid stools, however. Shake these stools off into the toilet before washing and stripping.;
, Stripping your diapers before you wash them could result in permanent stains.


Run your diapers through a cold rinse cycle.
After the rinse cycle, run the diapers through a hot wash cycle with a high water level. Use a mild, ""sensitive formula"" detergent that contains minimal dyes and fragrances. Only use a quarter to a half of the manufacturer recommended amount.
Put the washed diapers through a warm rinse cycle.
Follow the initial rinse cycle with an additional cool rinse cycle.

, A heavy-duty stock pot or aluminum boiling pot works best, but if neither of these pots is available to you, simply use the largest pot you have. Fill it 1/2 to 3/4 full with water and boil the water using high heat.

, Old-fashioned cloth diapers that have no waterproof lining can be immersed whole. If you have newer cloth diapers with a waterproof PUL (polyurethane laminated fabric) exterior, you must not immerse the whole diaper. Even though PUL is a type of cloth, the waterproof, plastic-like elements in the cloth will melt in boiling water. Instead, remove the soft cloth inserts and dunk them into the water, setting aside the PUL exterior.


Only boil one to three diapers or inserts at a time, depending on the size of your pot. Each diaper must have plenty of exposure to the boiling water, or else the stripping process many not be as effective.
Do not let plastic snaps come into contact with the side of the pot. The snaps should withstand the high temperature of the hot water, but they may melt if they come into contact with hot metal.

, Use tongs to swirl them around for the first 1 or 2 minutes, ensuring that the entire diaper gets exposed to the water. After that, keep the diapers submerged under water as much as you can. Stir them occasionally to make sure that the stripping is thorough and reaches every crevice of the cloth.


Some instructions only require submerging the diapers for 30 seconds, but the longer you keep them in the water, the more ammonia you can strip. If you strip your diapers and inserts frequently, however, you may only need to keep them in the boiling water for a couple of minutes each time.

, After you strip the first batch of diapers and inserts, dump the water, refill the pot, and bring the fresh water up to a boil before dunking the next batch. The ammonia, detergent, and grime you strip from the diapers ends up in the water once it gets stripped from the diaper. Dirty water is less effective for stripping than clean water is, and if you continue to use the same water for multiple batches, you may actually end up contaminating the final few batches instead of stripping them clean.

, Lay the PUL shells in the bowl with the waterproof lining facing down. Large glass bowls are especially suitable.

, Do not allow it to reach a rolling boil, since water this hot will scald and melt the PUL exteriors. Instead, only bring the water up to a low simmer. To be extra cautious, remove the water once it starts to steam.

, Allow the PUL shells to soak for 5 minutes before you remove them.

, Put them through a standard hot water cycle with a high water level, and rinse them in warm to cool water.

, Hang them to dry in direct sunlight to naturally bleach the diapers.


Alternatively, you can tumble dry them in your dryer on a low heat. Using a dryer may also help with sterilization.

, The hotter the water, the more effective it will be in stripping detergent build up and dirt.


Be sure to turn it back to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) or lower to avoid burns when you are finished.

, Do not add detergent.


If you have very hard water, try adding a commercial water softener to the load for extra efficacy.

, If possible, select the option for an extra rinse. Make sure it is set to agitate the load or wash it for heavy soil.


Check your wash during the rinse setting to see if you have any bubbles. If so, then detergent build up is probably your main problem that needs to be stripped from the diapers.

, Dry your diapers after the last cycle and assess their smell and texture.


Consider buying a special cloth diaper detergent, instead of using your commercial detergent, since it is more likely to wash out.
If you continue to use regular commercial detergent, use less than the amount indicated to avoid detergent build up in the future.

Decide whether you can manage it.,
Get the necessary gear to get started.,
Focus on your Babies' Body Language.,
When they're ready, gently hold them over the potty or toilet.,
Sit and wait together.,
When they've finally done what you were after, dispose of the mess.",How to Practice Elimination Communication," If you're unable to supervise your baby all through the day then you'll probably be unable to do it full time. At night the best option would be to use washable diapers (if you're aiming for the most environmental practice) rather than trying to wake baby and disrupting your own sleeping hours.;
, You'll still need some diapers so buy up a set with multiple sizes. Most important is the potty, though this doesn't have to be the sort that toddlers use, it is an ideal option later (when babies can support themselves freely). One of the most well-known symbols of elimination communication is the ""top hat"" potty. This is a good for when your outside or it's cold because you can slip a soft pad on to keep them warm.

, Work out how long after being fed that they need to ""go"". This can be every 15 minutes to an hour (the time gap with grow wider with age). A baby knows when it has a full bladder just like we do, but is unable to control it at that stage. They will wriggle with discomfort when they need a pee or poop, just as anyone else would.

, if you're only using a ""Top Hat"" they can probably be just put on, but will still need to be held at the waist or underarms so they don't fall off. Even when your baby can sit up without assistance (usually after 6 months old but not always), they'll still need constant supervision. Alternatively, you can hold them by the legs, lifting them very slightly upwards (this will create a little pressure on the bladder) until their knees are at about the same height as their navel (tummy button).

, You may have to wait a while (slightly less when they've been given a feed), but it will come. Always make sure you give your child over to someone else to carry out the deed before you go somewhere else.

, You can simply flush away any business in the toilet if that's the way you did it, or just pour the potty into the bowl and flush. Give the potty a quick wipe-down after every use; the last thing a baby needs is a rash. When out and about, it's surprisingly easy to get rid of liquid waste, as dogs (and other animals, to some extent) go outside in suburbia all the time.

Choose a changing area to manage vaporization, diffusion and airflow.,
Manage appearance.,
Keep the diaper-changing space neat and clean.,
Store the dirty diapers in a cool, relatively sealed, regularly emptied place.,
Toilet train the child early.",How to Make Diaper Changes Less Unpleasant," The smell is generally the worst part. To gross you out, the stench molecules have to get to your nose. How does that happen? First, they have to vaporize out of the poop, which happens much faster as it is warm. Then, an air current can carry them, which would be fast. Or they'll have to wander through the air by Brown (really!) -ian motion, which is relatively slow (and proportionately lower in the cold, but don't freeze the baby.So, to not smell the stench much:


Find a relatively cool area, within reason, for diaper changes. If the poop cools faster it won't stink as much.
Find a spot with good airflow direction. A sun-warmed side of a room generally isn't ideal because the warm air there will rise toward you. The warmth of the baby and the poo will cause some convection regardless so try not to position yourself directly over the baby.
Optimally, remove the bad air. There are a few options:

Change the baby in a room with an exhaust fan, such as a bathroom.
Change the baby in a room well ventilated to the outdoors, such as one with all the windows open or a porch, in good weather.
Change the baby in the general area of a window, opened for the purpose, that air tends to flow out of due to the house's general configuration or that flow out of is created with a window fan with exhaust (some kind of baffle would prevent excess heat loss or gain from outside).
Make a changing table with an exhaust. Air can't be sucked from a particular direction, so the intake(s) need to be near the stench. A light directional laminar flow of air might push bad air from another direction to them. One possibility is a perforated false bottom, like peg-board, for a changing table, removable or with an access panel for cleaning out anything that gets into the plenum. Another would be intakes on one or both sides of a shallow trough which would contain the baby. The exhaust could couple to an existing vent such as for a bathroom with a baffle to prevent backflow into a room, a suction source such as a central vacuum, or a portable source such as a portable air-conditioner window exhaust (again, preferably with baffle and window sealing when heat or AC is in use). Install a touchless fan power switch or couple it to the folding-down of a retractable changing table for the ultimate in convenience. Do not put electricity near, or possible to be conducted to, the baby!

Exhausting warm or cool air that contains stench may waste heating or cooling. See if it can economically be purified by something like activated carbon, or might be neutralized rather than just circulated by an air conditioner (whose condensate may absorb odour and is generally sent outside) or furnace (whose heat might destroy it), in which case changing baby by a convenient intake could be acceptable. Try to update the article!




As an alternative, cut off the initial emergence of stench by rinsing off the baby with water during the changing process. This can be done on a special changing table, and can be combined with ventilation techniques (generally not a fan near the water). But don't risk dropping a wet baby, especially onto a hard floor.;
, The senses are connected, at least psychologically: for example, smelling something pungent like an onion while eating something sweet like chocolate will make it taste terrible. Similarly, green grassy goose poop just looks weird, not particularly gross like little dog poops. Dim, shadowy lighting, cheap, basic cold fluorescent lighting, or even colored bulbs can make it look unnatural and sterile, which is perfect for something naturally disgusting.


Colored glasses might work too, but make sure you don't put them on with dirty hands.

, Less time reaching for supplies and less places to soil that are not easily cleanable will make the process faster and less mentally involved. It will also make a cleaner, healthier environment for the baby.

, A well-covered diaper bin will keep the dirties from continually soiling the air, and keeping it cool will reduce the accumulated nastiness that can escape. There are even fancy pails that apply individual wrappers.


Cloth diapers can be set in a pail under water to soften soil and possibly dilute and reduce surface area for stench diffusion., With pull-up diapers, the changing is not as involved. Just be sure not to attempt to toilet train them so early as to where the child is frustrated with constant failure. No dirty diapers means none to change!

It's important to use organic paper towels as non organic paper towels may contain bleach, dye and other chemicals commonly used in the production of paper products.


As a general rule of thumb, name brand paper towels make better wipes than the cheaper, generic versions. Do ensure the paper towels are organically produced.;
, You can use regular water if you will use the wipes in less than a week. Otherwise, use boiled or distilled water to avoid mold. Tap water commonly contains chlorine. You may prefer to use rainwater., Pure aloe vera acts as a soothing solution. It is available at health food and organic stores.

Coconut oil also gives the cream its creaminess and makes it easy to apply and comfortable for your baby’s skin.;
, Beeswax holds the other ingredients together and helps them stick to the skin. It also creates a protective barrier for the skin. It can be purchased at natural stores and online retailers like Amazon.com.


For your lotion to work efficiently, look for beeswax pellets, which are the easiest to dissolve into the diaper cream. You can also buy a chunk of beeswax and grate it with a standard cheese grater.

, Zinc oxide is the key ingredient in commercial diaper cream and is what coats the skin and kills the bacteria. Zinc oxide makes the skin waterproof and helps to keep it from drying out, which is particularly important in drying and preventing diaper rash.Some organic purists don’t like to include it in their diaper cream because they view it as an added chemical, but you can purchase the pure, non-nano versions at many natural stores and online retailers like Amazon.com.
For an alternative, use a few extra tablespoons of beeswax to thicken the cream., Diaper cream is prepared by steaming, so it is advisable for this purpose to obtain a double-bottomed pot, or two pots that fit into each other. Get pots that you will use only for such purposes because this mixture is difficult to wash.

, These can be wooden ice cream sticks, or any other sticks that can later be disposed of. Cutlery will be hard to wash off, and plastic sticks or accessories contain chemicals that are also not healthy for your child.

, Look for a container with a hermetic lid in which to pour the cream when finished. Look for glass packaging materials, as they store the cream well without adding any extra chemicals to the mix. For this reason, avoid plastic."

¼ cup Shea butter
¼ cup coconut oil
1 tablespoon beeswax pellets
2 tablespoons fermented cod liver oil
2 tablespoons zinc oxide powder
1 tablespoon bentonite clay

, To begin making the cream, melt the shea butter, coconut oil, and beeswax in the microwave or in a double boiler on low heat. Once it is melted or very close to melted, add the fermented cod liver oil and continue to heat gently until everything is melted and combined.


Add the zinc oxide and bentonite clay and stir until combined. Freeze for 5 to 10 minutes to cool and solidify.
Remove from freezer and mix using a hand mixer or stick blender for 5 to 10 minutes or until stiff peaks form.

Know that organic diaper cream helps you to avoid exposing your baby to unfamiliar or unknown ingredients.,
Understand that organic diaper cream is kinder to sensitive skin.,
Be aware that organic diaper cream is a better choice if you’re using cloth diapers.",How to Make Organic Diaper Cream4," Organic items are made of natural materials and don’t include harsh chemicals or man-made products.


Some parents choose to use organic products on their babies because they like knowing exactly what is being put on their child and that the environment was hurt as little as possible to make the product.

, Other parents use organic materials, especially diaper cream, because it helps their baby’s sensitive skin. Organic products are free from many of irritants that can cause a baby’s skin to turn red or itchy.


A baby’s skin is very absorbent and drinks in everything that is placed on it, which makes organic diaper cream even more important.

, If you are using cloth diapers instead of disposable diapers, organic baby cream becomes even more important. If you are using cloth diapers, commercial diaper cream may not be as effective and can even ruin the diapers. Homemade organic diaper cream is safe for all kinds of diapers and all kinds of baby skin.

Think about packing some lip balm and hair pins.",How to Pack a Diaper Bag for Twins," It is important to have a single, large diaper bag that can hold everything for both of the twins instead of carrying separate bags for each. Having a single bag for both babies will make life easier and reduce your chances of forgetting something important. You already have two children to keep track of, why make it harder with two diaper bags to keep track of as well?


The set-up of the diaper bag is more of a personal choice. Some parents like to have diaper bags with lots of separate compartments for things like wipes or bottles, while other parents are content with something that has one large compartment and maybe a pocket or two.
The diaper bag needs strong handles or straps that can support the weight of its contents. The handles or straps also need to be padded so they are comfortable when the parent has to carry it for an extended period of time.;
, Usually parents have a general idea of how often their babies will need to have a fresh diaper and they can use this information to calculate how many diapers to take on an outing. However, the babies might have off days, and use fewer or more diapers than expected.


A good general rule to follow is to pack one diaper per child, for every hour of the outing, plus a few extras just in case.
Make sure to replace the diapers after each outing, so you have the same number of diapers each time. There's nothing worse than a diaper bag with no diapers!

, Even though you have two babies, you only need to include one large packet of wipes. This ensures that the wipes do not become dried out before you get to the end of the packet.

, Something that many parents forget to include in their diaper bags is plastic bags. These have many uses, including:


To store dirty diapers if you have nowhere to dispose of them at the moment.
To hold any dirty clothes and keep them separate from everything else until they can be properly taken care of at home.
To store any sterilized items like spoons or bowls.
Keep approximately ten plastic zip bags in the diaper bag at any given time.

, Carrying a small first aid kit that contains a few essentials (for both parent and babies) is always a good idea.


Include the most necessary first aid items, such as adhesive bandages, children's painkillers like Tylenol or Advil and anti-rash cream.
You should also keep a small scissors in the first aid kit - this can come in useful when you least expect it!

, It is a given fact that babies can go through quite a few outfits in a single day and there is no way to tell exactly when they will need a change of clothes due to one type of messy accident or another.


Many parents of single birth babies prefer to pack one complete outfit for every two hours that they are supposed to be away from home, in addition to at least one emergency outfit in case there is a delay.
Parents of twins can follow the same system - only doubled!

, If the twins are of the same gender, it is easy to simply pack twice as many outfits.


For example, when taking the twins on an outing that is supposed to last four hours, the parents should pack six complete outfits. Complete outfits include the outer clothes as well as under shirts, socks, and booties or shoes.
It is a good idea to have a few outfits made from articles of clothing that can be mixed and matched so that they can be combined in various ways, in case one twin messes a top and the other messes a bottom.

, When the twins are of opposite genders, there is no telling which one will need new outfits the most. This can be a bit trickier to pack for, but it is manageable.


The parent can use the same guideline of packing one complete gender specific outfit per two hours for each twin and several additional gender-neutral outfits that are neutral so they can be worn by either gender.
If there is concern about strangers not knowing the gender of the babies when they are wearing neutral outfits, the parent could always use hair bows, hats, or other accessories to distinguish the girl from the boy.

, Bibs are another important item to pack in a diaper bag. This is especially true if the babies will be out past a scheduled feeding time or if they tend to drool a lot due to teething.


A good rule of thumb is to include a bib for every outfit that is packed because the bibs will need to be changed just as often as clothes, if not more often.

, The parents should pack enough baby food or bottles to get the babies through all of the feedings that would be scheduled to occur during the time that they will be away from home as well as enough for at least one extra feeding for each baby.


For formula-fed babies, it is a good idea to fill the baby bottles with the proper amount of water and pack a container of dry formula so that the bottles can be made fresh.
If breast milk has been previously pumped and put in bottles, it will need to be kept cool with a small ice pack during warmer weather.
If possible, the babies should be fed before the outing begins. This will help them feel content so they are less likely to be fussy.

, Although many parents feed their babies the food straight from the jar or container, it is not a good idea because the saliva on the spoon could spoil any food that is saved for the next meal. Therefore, it is a good idea to pack small bowls, or even use previously emptied and cleaned baby food containers, to divide the food for separate meals.


Of course, the parents should also pack several baby spoons for each baby as well as a zippered bag to hold the used spoons until they can be washed.
Any opened jars or containers of baby food will also need to be placed in a cold pack to be kept cool in warm weather.

, If one or both babies are on any type of medication, it is important to pack enough to cover all of the doses that would be scheduled during the time that the outing is supposed to last.


Usually if a baby is on a prescription medication the pharmacy can be asked to split the medication into two containers that both have the proper pharmacy label. This way, one container can be stored in the diaper bag while the other is left at home.
It is very important that the containers have the proper labels so that the correct medication and dosage can be given to each twin if they happen to be on different medications or dosages.
If the same over-the-counter medication is being given to both babies, it is a good idea to use separate droppers or measuring spoons that are labeled with their names so that they do not cross-contaminate each other and perpetuate the illness.

, If the babies like pacifiers or will not fall asleep without one, it is a good idea to pack a few extras just in case one falls on the ground, develops a tear, or gets lost.


Along with the pacifiers, a few toys can be a great distraction when traveling. Some parents pack the babies’ favorite toys, while others prefer to have special toys for the diaper bag so they seem new and exciting to the babies.
If the parent forgets to pack toys, the best “toy” or distraction is the parent that plays peek-a-boo or other fun things. Older babies also enjoy playing with sunglasses, mirrors, and other safe things that parents might have readily available.

, Although parents are likely to remember to pack blankets during cold weather, they might not realize that blankets have many uses during the warmer weather, too. It is a good idea to pack several weather-appropriate blankets in the diaper bag for the following reasons:


They can be used on the floor to give the babies a clean place to play or used as extra padding when changing a diaper on a hard surface.
Blankets can be draped over strollers or infant car seats to keep the sun out.
They are also great for privacy if the mother is breast feeding.

, It's a good idea to pack an extra, clean shirt for yourself, in case one of the babies spits up on your clothes or you spill milk or baby food on yourself. The chances of something like this happening are doubled with twins. Opt for a shirt made from a crease-proof material, as it might be sitting at the bottom of the diaper bag for a while!

, Being hungry tends to make people more irritable and impatient, which is not a good thing when you're dealing with twins. Therefore, it's a good idea to pack some snacks for yourself that are quick and easy to eat, such as cereal bars, small packs of nuts or raisins, or a yogurt (in a cool pack).


You should also pack a bottle of water so you can stay hydrated. This is particularly important if you are breastfeeding twins.

, Choose the safest pocket of the bag that closes with a zipper and use it for storing important things like car keys, home keys, your cell phone, and money. This will prevent you from having to carry a handbag in addition to a diaper bag.

, Mothers who enjoy bringing their twin babies to the the park or for long walks will benefit from packing items like lip balm and hairpins in the diaper bag, especially if it is very windy or cold outside.

Play peekaboo.,
Play hide and seek.,
Give your baby containers to play with.,
Talk to your baby.,
Create a basic routine.,
Watch your 0 to 4 month old's reflexes.,
See how your 4 to 7 month old reacts to an object.,
Consider if your 8 to 12 month old has developed object permanence.,
Watch for coordination in your 12 to 18 month old.,
Notice your 18 month (or older) baby develop separation anxiety.",How to Help Babies Learn About Object Permanence," To play peekaboo, hold both of your hands over your face so that the palms are facing you and your fingers cover your eyes. Hold your hands in place for a few seconds then remove your hands and say, ""Peekaboo!"" Most young babies who haven't developed object permanence will laugh or smile to see you disappear and reappear.Babies who have developed object permanence will see peekaboo as more of a game so you can mix it up a little. Try covering your face and then popping out from a side of your hands instead of just removing both of your hands.;
, Hide and seek works well with an older baby who's beginning to understand that objects can still exist even if they're in different places. To play, show your baby an object and hide it. Ask your baby where the toy is. You may even lift up cushions or blankets that aren't covering the toy to get your baby started.Ensure that you're naming objects while you play hide and seek so your baby can begin to put names with items. For example, say, ""Good! You found the ball!""

, Offer your baby a variety of containers in different sizes. At first, let your baby experiment with stacking, sorting and feeling the containers. Then, put a few items in the containers for your baby to explore. Your baby might like taking things out, putting them back in or just shaking the containers.


Never give a baby small items even if you're placing them in containers. These could become choking hazards.

, Help your baby learn about objects and develop a good memory by simply talking. Be in the habit of saying what something is when you hand it to the baby. Tell your baby what you're doing even if you're preparing a meal or washing dishes. You should also talk to your baby about what your baby is doing too.Don't forget to talk to your baby when you're out of the room. Your baby will be able to hear you and will learn that you didn't just disappear. Instead, you're just in the other room.

, If you can, develop a daily routine with simple activities. This will teach your baby what to expect and help your baby to understand their environment. For example, you might read a book to your baby after feeding and changing your baby’s diaper. Or you might cuddle and sing to your baby before putting your baby down for bed.Basic routines help your baby understand past and future events. When they understand the sequence of things, they'll also be able to better understand the permanence of objects.

, From birth to around 4 months old, babies aren't really aware of objects or items around them. Instead, they recognize movements that they make. You'll probably see a baby kick their leg or waive their arm repeatedly. Babies learn about how their bodies move through these movements.You might notice your 3 or 4 month old begin to show an interest in objects. Your baby may get excited when you show them a rattle or toy, but at this age, your baby won't get upset if you take the object away.

, Once your baby shows an interest in an object, try hiding the object partially. Place a blanket halfway over a rattle that your baby enjoys playing with. Between 4 and 7 months, most babies will try to find the object and will reach for it. The baby recognizes the object exists and wants it.Object permanence is beginning to develop.The baby may shake, kick or try to grab the object. Babies might do this because doing this feels good or the object makes a sound that they like hearing.

, Most researchers agree that babies develop object permanence by around 8 months old. This means that if you show your baby an object and hide the object, the baby will search for it because the baby remembers that the object still exists.You could even try completely removing the object to watch your baby hunt for it.
At this age, your baby will probably come looking for you if you leave the room. Many babies develop separation anxiety during this time., Once your baby remembers that an object exists even when the object is removed, your baby will learn to react to changes in the object. For example, if your baby sees you hide a toy under a cushion, but you move the toy underneath a blanket, the baby will continue to look in different places until it finds the toy.You may even notice your baby immediately searching in places other than where you originally hid the object. Your baby may expect the object to be in a different place.

, As your baby grows and develops object permanence, your baby will also realize that they exist separately from you and objects. If your baby did not develop separation anxiety earlier on, then your baby may develop a little separation anxiety as they begin to understand that you may leave.The baby may be able to play alone for longer periods of time or mimic fantasy play as the baby becomes more independent.

Understand the labels.,
Choose a product that is certified organic.,
Start with your baby's food.,
Get rid of chemical-based baby skin care products.,
Choose diapering products free of chlorine, fragrances and pesticides.,
Assess your baby's sleep environment.,
Do an inventory of your baby's clothing.,
Learn about the materials that go in your baby's mouth.",How to Implement Organic Baby Care Methods," Making organic choices is simple when you know how to read the labels. Don't be confused by fancy marketing terms such as ""all natural"", ""hypoallergenic"" or ""no growth hormones"". Organic is the only term that is regulated.;
, This means the manufacturer has taken extra precautions to ensure the product can bear the seal of approval. In the US certified organics contain no pesticides, antibiotics, fertilizers, growth hormones, food additives, fertilizers or sewage sludge.

, Choose organic milk or formula and then expand to cereal, produce and meat. This will help you avoid genetically modified foods, growth hormones and chemical additives.

, Approximately 60% of what goes on your baby's skin is absorbed into the bloodstream within minutes. Read the labels of all lotions, shampoos and body care products. Replace products with unfamiliar chemicals for those made from food or plant based ingredients.

, In most cases your baby has a diaper on 24 hours a day, its . Explore the many options available in cloth diapers, flushables and chlorine-free disposables and choose the one that fits your lifestyle.

, Your baby spends a lot of time in the bed those first few months. Incorporate organic cotton, wool or bamboo materials in the selection of your baby's crib sheet, mattress or mattress topper to prevent your baby from inhaling noxious chemicals during sleep.

, Remove polyester, fleece and clothing made with heavy, starchy fabric finishes. Pure cotton is a healthier alternative and organic cotton is even healthier because it is free of potentially carcinogenic pesticides. Hemp and bamboo fabrics don't involve the use of pesticides and are also healthy alternatives.

, Soon there will be non-toxic and organic versions of everything. What you need depends on your baby's development stage. Baby bottles, pacifiers, teethers, toys and furniture can all be made of natural, non-toxic materials which are better for your baby.

Add gestures that match the song.,
Play “fill in the sounds.” Many children’s songs utilize onomatopoeia — a word derived from the sound associated with it (such as cuckoo or bark).,
Move to the music.,
Introduce numbers and letters.,
Sing instead of using recorded music when possible.,
Start early in life.,
Begin with classic tunes in your language.,
Get creative as your newborn continues to develop.,
See how music and language skills are connected.,
Prioritize repetition, rhythm, and rhyme.,
Coordinate music with activities.,
Sing, listen, and learn together.",How to Improve Language Learning in Babies Using Music," Most babies develop the ability to control their fingers and hands (at around nine months) before they can control their speaking voice (somewhere around ten to twelve months). As anyone who uses sign language can tell you, communicating with gestures requires similar memorization and pattern recognition and anticipation skills. Therefore, using music and gestures in combination can enhance the developmental benefits for your baby.Try using simple songs that utilize simple hand gestures that coordinate with the lyrics. For instance, sing “Wheels on the Bus” and make the hand motions for the spinning wheels, swooshing wipers, opening doors, and so on.;
, Children can often replicate such sounds before they can speak other types of words, so you can use this as an opportunity for an early sing-along in which you sing most of the lyrics but allow the child to jump in to make the sound effects.“Old McDonald” is one of the best songs for this type of activity, what with all the repetition, identification of different animals, and “woofs,” “moos,” “quacks,” and so on.
Anticipating the correct time to “jump in” may also help the child pay closer attention to the other lyrics in the song, which in turn can aid in language development.

, Practically all kids, once they can get up on their feet (however shakily), love to dance. If you coordinate dance styles to match the tempo and beat of particular songs, you can help the child build awareness of cadence and rhythm, both of which are key elements of language development. Of course, this also means that you have to dance along!For instance, model some deliberate, delicate movements while listening to “The Nutcracker,” then speed things up by putting on your favorite (kid-friendly) hip-hop album.
The “Hokey Pokey” is another good kid-friendly song example, as it utilizes simple, repeated dance moves that follow the music.

, The odds are decent that you learned your letters with the help of the “ABC Song,” and perhaps picked up on numbers by belting out “One, two, buckle my shoe …” or “This old man, he played one …”. Instill these building blocks of language and learning in general by listening and singing to fun songs together.While nearly everyone seems to gravitate towards the same alphabet song, the options for numbers are nearly endless — “Five Little Monkeys,” “The Ants Go Marching,” “One Potato, Two Potato,” and so on. Or make up your own songs.

, Listening to music in any manner benefits all people, from fetuses still in the womb to Alzheimer’s patients. However, in babies and young children, the language-development benefits of listening to recorded music are not as clear as the benefits of being sung to (and singing along when able). So, no matter what you think of your voice, sing to your baby instead of popping in a CD or streaming a lullaby playlist whenever you can.Even in their earliest stages of life, singing to a baby provides an interactive and reciprocal experience that cannot be matched by recorded music. In addition to the elements of bonding and visual feedback it provides, singing in your own voice also introduces specific language patterns and tones to your child.

, Opinions still vary on the benefits of placing headphones on your stomach to play classical music to your fetus, but it is clear that babies in the womb can hear and recognize familiar voices. Singing to your (or your significant other’s) belly may seem a bit awkward at first, but it is an easy way to begin the bonding process and introduce your baby to both your voice and your language patterns.Once the baby is born, keep up the singing with regularity. The peak period for “speech sound learning” occurs at around nine months for most babies, but the earlier and more consistent the stimulation of the language centers of your baby’s brain, the better., Let’s face it — the lyrics of many popular lullabies and nursery rhymes either make little sense or seem a bit inappropriate to sing to an infant. However, such longstanding tunes usually carry “signature” melodies and inflections that are representative of that particular language. Think of them as the “master tunes” that can help prepare your baby’s brain, ears, and voice for that language.In English, for instance, classics like “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” and “Rock-a-bye Baby” are good choices to put into heavy rotation. Even if you may get a bit tired of singing them over and over, babies don’t mind (and usually love) repetition.
If you live in a bilingual household or are otherwise trying to teach your baby two languages, utilize classic baby songs in both languages.

, For your own sanity and as a means to further your baby’s language development, you can begin over time to adapt the lyrics of familiar tunes to match different situations. Providing new language information within a familiar “package” can help ease continued language acquisition.For instance, “Wheels on the Bus” can easily be adapted in various ways — such as “This is the way we wash our hands / brush our teeth / eat our peas.”
Try not to “jam” words that don’t fit or too much new material into familiar songs, though, or you may foster more confusion than learning.

, There is ample scientific evidence that music benefits brain development overall, and language development in particular. A 2016 U.S. study, for instance, found that 9-month-old babies who were given drums to bang away on showed increased brain activity in the pattern recognition areas essential to language development, in comparison to babies given blocks or other toys to play with.To help better explain the connection between hearing and/or creating music and language development, some experts rely on what is known as the OPERA thesis. It posits that music stimulates an Overlap of cognitive processes used in both music and language; enhances Precision in the brain’s processing of audio clues; heightens the Emotional response to the stimuli; facilitates the Repetition skills common to music and language; and increases the Attention and focus of the listener., Practically every form of music, from lullabies to heavy metal, is built upon a foundation of repeating patterns. Experiencing musical patterns, either by hearing or creating them, helps small children and people of all ages enhance the pattern repetition and anticipation skills required for learning a language. Therefore, easily discernible and repeating patterns, consistent rhythm, and repetition through rhyme are particularly helpful for small children.Music is constructed from a series of repeating parts that make up the whole. Recognizing and mastering these smaller, more easily digestible pieces is easier for most small children to handle., We all know that different types of music have different impacts upon our mood, focus, energy levels, and overall emotional state. When incorporating music into language learning for small children, choose music types that align with the setting and goals. For instance, use upbeat music for motivation and energy, and classical or instrumental music to enhance calm and focus.Combine music with other learning activities, from reading aloud to visual demonstrations. A familiar musical accompaniment increases recall abilities, with the “ABC Song” as perhaps the best-known example for small kids.

, Music presented in isolation will never have the same impact upon a small child as the social, interactive experience of listening to or singing with a parent or loved one. Language is, after all, designed for communication with other people, so language development is likewise enhanced through social interaction. Experience and enjoy music together, and your child will derive greater benefits in a host of different ways.Don’t simply rely on music to improve language learning in a baby or small child; rely on sharing the experience of music with the child to support and enhance the range of skills required for language development.

Be calm and confident before picking up the baby.,
Support the baby's head with one arm and support its bottom with the other.,
Make chest-to-chest contact.,
Enjoy bonding with the baby.",How to Hold a Baby1," Babies can often sense if you're uncomfortable or upset. Relax. Confidence is the key; holding a baby for the first time can be extremely terrifying for some people. You just have to remember that you can do this, and the joy of holding that baby will outweigh all of the anxieties! Though it's always important to be as careful as possible also remember: Babies are not as fragile as we think.;
, A newborn baby's head is by far the heaviest part of their body, and a baby's head and neck needs careful support. Usually you will hold the head gently with one hand. Use your right arm to scoop up the baby's bottom. Do this while supporting the head with your other hand.

, Bring the baby close to your chest, so that they can rest their head against your chest. Babies are instinctively comforted by hearing your heartbeat. Your right hand and arm should be supporting most of the baby's body weight, while your left hand supports and protects the head and neck.


Just make sure that your baby's head is facing to one side so that they can always breathe.

, Holding a baby can be incredibly soothing for both you and the baby. This is a great time to sing to the baby, read to the baby, and entertain the baby until it's time for the next feeding, diaper change, or nap. You will need to switch hands from time to time. When you do this, remember to always keep one hand under the baby's head as you switch hands.


Listen to your baby. Each baby has their own preferences for how they want to be held. If your baby is crying or being fussy, try switching to a different holding position.

Do the cradle hold.,
Do the face-to-face hold.,
Do the belly hold.,
Do the football hold.,
Do the ""hello world"" hold.,
Hold your baby on your hip/side when it can support its own head.",How to Hold a Baby2," This is perhaps the most common way to hold your baby and a great way to gaze into the new baby's eyes; it's also the most natural and easiest way to hold your baby. It's easiest to hold your baby this way when the baby is swaddled. Here's what you should do:


To cradle hold your baby, first lay your baby down and pick it up by sliding one hand under the neck and head, and the other under the bottom and hips.
Spread your fingers as much as you can as you lift them to your chest so you can support the baby as much as possible.
Gently slide the hand supporting their head and neck along their back, so that their head and neck slide along your forearm, making their way into the crook of your arm and elbow.
Keep your other hand where it was, cupping your baby's hips and bottom.
Bring the baby close to your body and gently rock their back and forth, if you like.

, This is a great hold for interacting with your baby. Here's what you have to do to get it right:


Place one hand behind your baby's head and neck.
Put the other hand under their bottom.
Hold the baby out in front of you, just below your chest.
Have fun smiling and making faces at your cute baby.

, This hold is perfect for calming your baby down when they are being fussy. Here's what you have to do to master this hold:


Drape your baby's head and chest over your forearm.
Make sure that the baby's head is turned outward, resting near the crook of your arm.
Pat or rub your baby's back with your other hand.
Check your baby's head and neck to ensure that they are supported at all times.

, This hold is great for feeding and can also be used whether you're standing or sitting. Here's how you do it:


Place a hand under your baby's head and neck and rest the baby's back on the inside of the same forearm of the hand you're using to hold its head. You can use the other hand as a placeholder under the baby's head as you get adjusted, as long as you make sure that the head and neck are supported at all times.
Have the baby curl around the side of your body, with its legs extended behind you.
Draw the baby close to your chest or your waist.
Use your free hand to feed the baby or give its head extra support.

, This is a great hold if you have a curious baby and want to let it see what is going on around it. Here's all you have to do:


Let your baby's back rest against your chest so that his head is supported.
Place one arm under his bottom.
Place the other arm across his chest.
Make sure that the baby's head remains supported by your chest.
If you're sitting down, then you can place the baby on your lap and don't need to put a hand under his bottom.

, Once your baby has gotten a bit older, somewhere in the 4-6 month mark, they should be able to steadily support their own head! Once your baby has achieved this, here's how you can hold him/her on your hip: (The seemingly most common hold for very young babies and toddlers alike):


Rest the baby's side (nestled) or midsection (straddling you,) against your side/hip. Be sure to rest the baby's left side or midsection against your right side/hip; or vice versa, depending on which side you wish to hold the baby. Make sure that no matter which side you hold the baby on, you ensure that the baby's head faces outward. (Refer to the photograph above. The mother is holding the baby on her right side/hip, From the baby's left side (straddling) with the baby's head facing forward.)
Use the arm of your ""holding"" hip/side to support the baby's legs and back. Add support firmly, yet comfortably, for you and the baby.
You can use your free hand for extra support under the baby's legs, back, bottom or wherever else the baby may need extra support. You can also use this hand to feed your baby or perform other necessary tasks (so long as the baby does not need extra support and you feel very comfortable with this hold.)
This hold is very common, important and convenient; especially when you have to multitask. Take time to master this hold, use it safely and I promise, you will be very glad that you did.

Dress your baby.",How to Give a Baby a Bath," Roll up your long sleeves, remove your jewelry, and take off any other items, such as watches, that may get in your way. Know that bathing a baby can be a wet operation and be prepared to find a change of clothes afterward. You want to wear something you don’t care about so you can properly bathe your baby.;
, Once the baby’s in the bath, you won’t be able to leave his side, not even for a second, so it’s important to get all of the materials you need together. If you do forget something and are bathing your baby alone, then you’ll have to take him with you to retrieve it. Here’s what you’ll need to bathe your baby:


A soft towel with a hood
Extra towels just in case
Cotton wool balls, a washcloth or a sponge for washing your baby
A pitcher for pouring water over your baby
Baby soap
Baby shampoo (if you choose to use it)
A changing mat
A change of clothes
A clean diaper
Baby powder
Bath toys (optional)
Bubble bath (optional)
A tub for your baby if it’s small or a newborn

, You don’t want the tub to be filled any more than that so that there’s absolutely no chance of your baby drowning in the water. Before you put your baby in the water, you should test it on the underside of your wrist or dip your elbow in to make sure it’s warm to lukewarm and that there’s no way your baby can be burned by it.


The ideal temperature should be around 90ºF (32ºC).
Don’t ever place your baby in the tub while the water’s still running. This can lead the water to get too deep or too hot.
If your baby is newborn or very small, you should use a baby holder or a plastic tub for your baby. You can even wash your baby in the sink, which will make the process easier if the sink is large enough.
If you want to make bath time more fun, then you can add a few bath toys and bubble bath into the water before you place your baby in it. Just don't overdo it on the bubble bath or your baby may get overwhelmed.
Consider closing the bathroom door when you give your baby a bath. You don't want him to feel chilly once you take him out of the tub.

, Though you are perfectly capable of bathing your baby on your own, you should consider getting some help, whether it’s from the other parent, one of the child’s grandparents, or a friend. Just having another person there to guide you can help you feel reassured if it’s your first time and can make the process feel less overwhelming.

But if you have to do it on your own, there’s no need to worry and you’ll do a great job no matter what.

, Remove your baby’s clothes as well as his diaper. This should be the last thing you do before you bathe your baby. You don’t want to undress your baby first, or he may be getting cold as you prepare the tub.


If you find that your baby cries through every bath, then you should start bathing your baby with its diaper on. This can give it an added sense of security until it gets more comfortable in the water.
Of course, you should make sure your baby is ready for a bath before you begin bathing it. You should wait for the umbilical stump to completely fall off and heal before you bathe your baby. Before that, cleaning your baby carefully with a wet cloth will do.

, This is absolutely the most important part of giving your baby a bath. Know that a child can drown in less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. There’s absolutely nothing in the world that should make you leave your child in the tub by himself, not even for a second.

If you've forgotten something necessary for bathing your child, then you'll have to either leave it or take your baby with you to retrieve it.

, You should use one hand to support the baby’s head and neck. Slowly ease the baby into the water, whether you’re using the sink, a bathtub, or a small plastic tub for your baby. Make sure your baby is relaxed and comfortable.


Prepare for some tears. Not all babies like the feeling of being lowered into water, especially not at first. Others, however, love the water right away!

, Use a pitcher, or your hand, to carefully pour cupfuls of water onto your baby’s body and over its head. Make sure to wet your child’s skin and hair completely. Just don’t get water in your baby’s eyes or pour water all over its face quickly, or it will get upset. You want your baby to be completely wet before you start using soap.


Just know that babies will be more slippery when they're wet. Prepare to handle your baby with extra care once you've lowered it into the water.

, Make sure you use a mild, tear-free baby soap that won’t irritate your baby’s skin. Though some people like to use baby shampoo for their baby’s hair, it’s perfectly fine to use regular soap on your baby’s head; many people prefer this because it won’t dry out your baby’s scalp. Here’s how you wash your baby:


Use your hand or a gentle washcloth and wash your baby from top to bottom both on its front and back.
Wash the baby’s scalp with a soapy and wet cloth. If you’d like to use shampoo, you can do that, but it’s really not necessary. To use shampoo, just pour a dime-sized amount of tear free shampoo onto your hands, lather the shampoo into your hands and then massage your baby’s scalp with it.
Gently clean your baby’s eyes and face with a cloth that is free of soap. You don’t want to get soap in your baby’s eyes.
Give your baby’s genitals a regular washing. There’s no need to be extra thorough.
If any mucus is stuck around your baby’s nose or eyes, dab at it a few times before wiping it off.

, Once you’ve washed your baby with soap, you can wash your baby with the bathwater. Either pour clean water over your baby with your hands, or use a pitcher to pour water over your child to rinse all of the soap off. Make sure to do this slowly and gently so your baby doesn’t get too startled or overwhelmed.


If it’s safely possible, tilt the child's head back to avoid the eyes and pour cupfuls of water over their hair until it is soap free.

, Take your child out of the tub and place it in a soft, warm towel. As you do this, place one hand under her neck and the other under her bottom. If the towel has a hood, then that’s even better. Be careful with your baby when it's wet. Make sure that you've washed off all of the soap.


The whole bath should only take about five minutes. You don't want your baby in there too long or the water will get cold. Plus, a short bath is perfect for babies who don't like the water.

, Make sure to thoroughly pat your baby’s body and hair dry as gently as you can. If your baby’s skin is still peeling from birth, just use a bit of lotion on her if you want to, but know that this skin will come off anyway.

Rub lotion, baby powder, or diaper cream onto your baby’s body if that’s what you normally do. Just make sure your baby is dry first.

, Now that your baby is nice and clean, all you have to do is dress him. Place your diaper on your baby along with its clothes, and your baby should be nice and clean and ready for naptime—or for whatever the day may hold.

Try classic naptime activities.,
Simplify your nighttime routine.,
Encourage self-soothing.,
Don’t just let your baby cry.",How to Help Your Baby Nap1," Sometimes time-honored traditions are honored for good reason. Your grandparents, and their grandparents before them, probably sang lullabies and rocked with their babies to help them sleep. See if you can help bring on a nap with one or more of these classic methods:


Make sure you are winding down your baby's activity level before a nap. Don't go from a tickle-fest to suddenly trying to get your child to sleep. Choose calm activities as naptime approaches, like doing a puzzle together.
Nurse or bottle-feed your baby. It doesn’t need to be a full meal; the activity itself and the connection between you and your baby provides a calming effect.
Read a story, or a few. Point to the pictures. Do character voices. But read calmly and slowly.
Sing songs. “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” still holds up after all these years. Look at your baby as you sing in a quiet, soothing, reassuring tone.
Use a rocking chair. Or swing your baby back and forth gently in your arms.
Try, however, to put your baby down in the crib before they actually fall asleep. And remember that whatever patterns you set will become naptime expectations, so try to avoid methods that you won’t have the time or energy to repeat each naptime.;
, Especially if your baby is doing relatively well with sleeping at night, treat naps as miniature versions of bedtime. Draw from the major components of your nighttime routine while trimming and simplifying them for daytime use. Develop patterns that your child will associate with sleep whether it is night or day.For instance, if a bath is part of your nighttime routine, a gentle massage or some light baby-cleaning with a soft cloth and warm water might do the trick at naptime.
Keep the general order, even if the elements change a bit for naptime. If at bedtime you always read two stories while rocking, then nurse, then sing two songs, try trimming it down to one story, an abbreviated nursing, and one song.
Remember to change your baby's diaper before you begin your naptime routine.

, In the best case scenario, you don’t actually want to soothe your baby to sleep. Instead, you want to create soothing conditions that convince your baby to give into tiredness and take a nap. The actual “sleeping” part of the nap should begin in the crib, not in your arms; otherwise, you’ll establish a napping pattern that can be difficult to maintain for both of you.Follow your routine, then place your still-awake (but hopefully sleepy) baby into the crib. Quietly leave the room. Your baby might stir for a bit, but is likely to doze off before long.
If your baby is falling asleep in your arms, shorten your routine so that you can make it to the crib before the actual nap begins. Or do a quick diaper change to ward off sleepy-time for a few moments.
Use a pacifier (without any straps or clips) if that helps with self-soothing.

, “Self-soothing” is sometimes taken as another way to say “let babies cry themselves to sleep;” however, some experts believe that doing so only introduces feelings of fear and abandonment into the sleep process.If your baby begins to cry upon being put down in the crib, leave the room, wait a few minutes (perhaps five), then return if necessary and resume an abbreviated nap routine. It may take a few tries, but your baby should fall asleep eventually.If you’ve reached a breaking point, or are just plain exhausted, it is okay to let your baby cry in the crib for a longer spell. The crib is a physically safe location, and being with you while you are frazzled, distracted, or dismayed may not necessarily be so. Take a few moments when you need them, and don’t be ashamed to ask for help when necessary.

Establish a set napping space.,
Create a sleepy environment.,
Create your best replica when away from home.",How to Help Your Baby Nap2," Tired babies can fall asleep on noisy city busses or in the middle of eating dinner, but this is a sign of overtiredness and not a good nap substitute. If you want your baby to nap consistently on a day-to-day basis, you should try to define a single napping space that your baby can associate with (and only with) sleep. In the best case scenario, this napping space will also be their nighttime sleeping space — their crib.Don’t use swings, playpens, car seats, or other places or things as the regular napping spot. A properly set up crib placed in a good sleeping environment is the best and safest place for naps.
Use the crib only for sleep, not as a play space or temporary “holding zone” while you get a few chores done. Create the association “crib equals sleep” for your baby.

, Whether your baby’s crib is located in a dedicated nursery or in your bedroom, make sure that room is set up for ideal sleeping conditions during naps. Use blackout drapes to block sunlight; eliminate noise or use a white noise machine to block out distracting sounds; and maintain a temperature at or a bit below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), with about 50% relative humidity.Make your baby’s safety your first priority. Nothing should be in the crib except for your child, placed on their back on a properly-fitted sheet and firm, properly-sized crib mattress. Pajamas aren’t essential for naps, but choose clothing that can’t accidentally cover your baby’s face or head.Even things like the room’s color, use of decorative fabrics, and amount of clutter may impact its suitability as a napping environment. See Make Your Baby's Nursery Soothing Enough for Sleep for more details.

, Your baby still needs to nap when on day trips or family vacations, but your can’t very well drag the whole nursery along with you. In this scenario, bring along a few key comforts of the normal napping space — the white noise machine, your regular naptime books, or even the nursery’s night light. Provide as many of the comforts of naptime at home as is reasonable.When away from home, make sure that any portable playpens or cribs you use for napping are up-to-date with current safety standards, properly assembled, and set up according to the same criteria as the home crib. If you have any doubt about the quality of the sleeping quarters for your baby, bring along a portable crib that you know meets safety standards.
Traveling away from home can play havoc on your usual naptime schedules. Do your best to hold to the usual schedule, but expect to have to make some adjustments and variations. Pay close attention to your baby’s tiredness cues, especially if you are traveling across time zones.

"
"
Observe your baby’s routine.,
Read the signs of tiredness.,
Be as consistent as possible.,
Create “sleep associations.” Whether you’re following your baby’s lead or trying to establish defined nap times during the day, it is helpful to create a consistent routine that identifies the naptime process.",How to Help Your Baby Nap3," Newborns typically have no awake/asleep schedule beyond a constant repetition of feeding, sleeping, soiling their diapers, and crying for another feeding. At some point between one and four months, though, you may find that your baby stays awake for longer stretches and seems to want to sleep for fewer but longer periods.Ideally, from about four months to one year of age, a baby will want to take two naps per day and sleep fairly well through the night. In reality, though, the situation will vary widely from baby to baby. That is why observation is such an important step.
If your six-month-old seems to want to take three naps per day, or one longer and one shorter nap, or just one longer one at midday, use that information to help build the nap routine that is most likely to work for both of you.
Check out Put Your Baby on a Nap Schedule for more on the importance of observation and the process of building an individualized nap routine.

, Babies show that they’re tired in many of the same ways anyone else does. Look for droopy eyes, rubbing of the eyes, fussiness or crankiness, reduced alertness, and dozing off. Take note of when these signs appear, whether there seems to be a time (11 am and 4 pm) or activity (one hour after feeding) pattern involved, and how long after the signs appear that your baby tends to fall asleep.Your ultimate goal is to be able to anticipate the tiredness and put your baby down just as sleepiness sets in. A baby who isn’t yet tired is unlikely to nap without a fight, and an overly-tired baby may fight drifting off to sleep just as vociferously.

, If you baby is a naturally consistent daytime napper, part of your job is already done. If this is not the case, though, that doesn’t mean you cannot help guide your baby into a relatively consistent nap schedule. It may take some more work, but establishing a fairly consistent naptime pattern is worth the effort for both of you.If your baby wakes up at roughly the same time each morning (say 7:00), you can work to set up good napping conditions at regular times in the late morning and mid-afternoon (perhaps 11:00 and 3:30, respectively). If your baby wakes up at different times each morning, your might try to start the nap routine four hours after that day’s wake-up time, and then again four hours after that. In this case, the time of day of the naps will change a bit each day, but the length of time between wake-up and naptime won’t.

, Most babies are adept at recognizing signals, so set up a regular pattern of signals that indicate that naptime has arrived.The pattern, for instance, could be: a gentle massage; a story; rocking; nursing; singing; and placing your baby down for the nap.
Be aware that no one pattern works for every child, though. Expect to go through some trial-and-error to find the right process that gets your baby ready to sleep in a timely and effective manner. And, ideally, if you can get by with fewer “sleep associations” (say, rock — song — bed), the easier the daily process will be.

Accept hand-me-downs.,
Ask for help.,
Barter for baby clothes.",How to Get Free Baby Clothes1," Plenty of people hang on to old baby clothes for non-sentimental purposes, and are more than willing to give them away. Let friends, neighbors, family, and coworkers know that you're in need of baby clothes — even if they don't have kids, they might know someone who has baby clothes they'd be willing to give you. Not only that, someone might even have a crib or car seat they no longer need and would be happy to pass on.Ask relatives and friends before asking co-workers and casual acquaintances. People who are closer to you will probably be more eager to help out.
Don't limit yourself to asking people who have recently had kids. You can also ask people whose children have long outgrown their baby clothes.
Don't be afraid to ask people without kids for help, too. Your best friend may be single and without children, but she may have a brother or sister with five kids and plenty of extra clothes. Even if someone does not have any baby clothes they could donate to you, he or she may know someone that does.;
, Asking for help can take a toll on one's pride, but is sometimes necessary. Friends and family are more likely to be there for you when times get tough, so express to them that you need help buying baby clothes. Allow them to help you if they are willing to.


Hold onto the clothes that your friends and family members buy you. If you have another child, you can re-use these clothes or give them back to friends and family as they have their own children.

, Even if you don't have baby clothes to trade, you can barter other services in exchange for baby clothes. Knowing how to market your skills may be able to help you stock your infant’s closet without spending a penny.


If a neighbor down the street had a baby a few months before you, ask her if she would be willing to exchange a few outgrown clothes for a free night of babysitting.
If a coworker needs help with a bake sale and you happen to have cooking skills, offer to bake some of your famous cookies in exchange for baby clothes."

Exchange your unused baby clothes.,
Take gently used baby clothes to resale shops.,
Join swap communities.",How to Get Free Baby Clothes2," Babies come in all shapes and sizes, and they all grow at completely different paces. Some infants skip the newborn size altogether, and some outgrow their clothes faster than others. Moreover, you may receive an excessive amount of clothes in one size, only to find that your baby cannot cycle through all those clothes before outgrowing them. You might be able to exchange clothes that your baby never wore for clothes in larger sizes.


Keep tags on gifted clothes until they are used and ask gift-givers for a gift-receipt when they give you baby clothes., Resale shops specialize in buying items that are in good condition and selling them to others at lower-than-new prices. Many of these stores will give you the option of selling for either cash or store credit, and store credit is often a higher amount than you might receive in cash. You can drop your baby’s old, outgrown clothes off and pick some new clothes up for free.


In recent years, several national chain shops have opened that focus their efforts on reselling children's clothes and other kids' items. Look online to find your local branches of these national chains, as well as independent shops that specialize in children's resale., Online swap communities allow you to exchange items you have for items you need. Oftentimes, you have to worry about shipping and receiving those items without a third party stepping in, but many swap communities give you the option of searching for exchanges in your local area so that you can make the swap in person. There are many swap sites specifically for baby clothing and items.


Some of the best swap sites for baby items include:

MoxieJean.com (newborn to size 8)
ThredUP.com (kids, juniors, and women)
FlipSize.com (newborn to size 8, plus kids' shoes up to size 3)
SwapMamas.com (clothing and goods)"

Register for baby clothes.,
Look for online contests and giveaways.,
Contact charitable organizations.",How to Get Free Baby Clothes3," Soon-to-be moms should always register for gifts for their baby showers. Many register at places such as Target or Walmart. Car seats, strollers, and other big items are important to register for, but there are also many people who would love to buy something for your little one but lack the money to purchase something pricey. Baby clothes are the perfect gift for people on a budget (which, let's face it, many of us are). Register for newborn clothes as well as clothes in 0-3 and 3-6 month sizes., Visit websites and blogs that are geared at new parents or do an Internet search for ""baby clothing giveaways."" There are many people and companies who are eager to help, especially if they think that doing so can promote their own store or blog. Some contests may give away clothes, while others will give away gift cards that can be used on clothes.In addition to looking for contests focused on providing baby supplies, you can also search for contests that have nothing to do with babies as long as the award includes a gift card to a department store or another store that sells baby clothes., If you're in a difficult financial situation and you cannot afford baby clothes, you may qualify to receive help from numerous charitable organizations. Church charities can be extremely helpful to individuals going through a rough time, and you may also be able to get free baby clothes from secular charities, as well. Look online to find the charities near you.Contact local community organizations for low-income or teen mothers. A Chamber of Commerce or town hall may be able to give you a list. These groups will give you used clothing that has been donated. When your baby outgrows them, you can pay it forward by donating them and other clothes back.

Periodically clean the tray with soapy water and a clean, soft cloth to sanitize it.
Do not attempt to wash the tray in a dishwasher.
Dry the tray with a clean towel after washing it.;
, The side handle buttons are located along the underside of the tray. There is one button on each side of the tray.


These buttons are wedge-shaped.
The buttons are located along the outside of the seat's side railings.

, Place one hand over each side handle button. Press the buttons up and into the the rest of the tray.

, If you only want to adjust the tray, you can do so now by sliding the tray forward or backward as needed.


Note that the tray can be locked into three different positions.You should hear a ""click"" noise whenever the tray snaps into one of these positions.
These positions should only be used when the high chair is in use. Do not leave the tray on the chair at all when you plan to fold it up.

, When it is time to fold up the high chair, you should remove the tray completely. To do that, simply slide the tray all the way forward and off the chair side railings.


Set the tray aside for now. You can store it with the rest of the high chair once you fold it up.

, Before folding up the high chair, it is a good idea to clean off any spilled food or drink with a soft, damp cloth.


For sanitation purposes, you should periodically use soapy water while wiping down the seat pad and back.
Do not place any part of the chair in a washing machine or dryer.
Wipe the washed seat dry with a clean towel.

, Turn the chair around or walk behind it so that the back of the chair faces you.


Facing the chair from this position makes it much easier to fold it. You might have difficulty completing the steps if you stand in front of the high chair.

, There is one latch release trigger on each side of the chair. More precisely, they can be found beneath the side railings toward and toward the back of the chair.


There should be a slight indentation along the bottom of both triggers where your fingers can rest.

, Grab a latch release trigger in each hand and pull up on both triggers simultaneously.


It can take a little effort to press in both triggers. For best results, rest your thumb on a stationary part of the chair just above trigger to give yourself leverage. Use your other fingers to press the trigger in.
As you press the triggers, the rest of the chair should start lifting upward. Continue lifting until you hear a “click,” signifying that that the latches securing the chair's upright position have been released.

, The high chair should naturally start collapsing in on itself once the latches have been released. As soon as this happens, you can release the latch release triggers.


After removing your hands from the triggers, slide them up until the rest on the frame of the high chair just beneath the cloth-covered back of the seat.

, Push the cloth-covered back and the cloth-covered seat down and forward. Continue pushing until the seat and back are directly next to the legs.


Bend over as the seat rotates downward into the legs.
Alternatively, hold the seat with one hand and pick up the legs with your other hand. No part of the chair should touch the ground at this point. Fold the two sides together using both hands.

, When moving the folded chair, grab the legs and the side railings of the seat at the same time. Hold both sections together before you pick up or otherwise move the folded high chair around.The high chair does not have any straps to secure it while in its folded state. If you hold it only by one side (either the seat or the legs), it will probably fall back open.

, Store the folded high chair horizontally by placing it underneath a table, chair, or similar structure.


Rest the tray on top of the folded chair to reduce the risk of losing it.
Alternatively, you can store the chair in a vertical position by sliding it into a narrow corner between two other structures. The space must be narrow enough to hold the seat and legs close together; otherwise, the chair can easily fall back open.

, Grab the high chair so that the legs face you. The back and seat part of the chair should face outward.


When you unfold the chair, you will be standing behind it.
It is usually much easier to unfold the chair when standing in this position.

, Place the legs of the high chair on the ground. Grab onto the top edge of the seat back once the legs are steadied.


You may need to lean or bend over the chair to do this.
Only use one hand to grab onto the seat back. Use your other hand to keep the rest of the chair steady.

, Pull up and back on the seat, separating both the back and seat part of the chair from the legs in the process. Continue pulling the seat away until you hear a click.


The noise signifies that the chair has snapped securely into its upright position.

, Position the back of the tray over the side railings. Push on the tray, sliding it over the railings and toward the back of the chair.


If the tray gives you any resistance as you try putting it back on, try pressing in the two side handle buttons. It should slip on more smoothly after that.
Continue sliding the tray in until you hear another click. That noise signifies that it has snapped into place.
After reattaching it, try wiggling the tray without pressing in the side handles. It should remain still.

Choose clothing that represents something special.,
Wash and press the baby clothes.,
Pick a type of display frame.",How to Frame Baby Clothes1," It can be clothes in which the baby was baptized, the clothes in which she left the hospital, or a piece of clothing that is particularly beautiful and sweet. The item could have sentimental value for you, or you could choose a piece that you think is the prettiest or cutest.


Add the important details. In addition to clothing, you can add a photo of your child wearing those clothes. You could also put the shoes that went with the clothes on display next to the item of clothing.;
, It is very important that the baby clothes be thoroughly washed and dried before they are framed. Even something that is not visible, such as perspiration, can ruin the clothes over time. If it is possible, the clothes should also be pressed to remove any wrinkles so that they look impressive inside the frame.


When pressing the clothes, do not use any chemicals, as these could cause the clothes to become discolored over time. Instead, a light spritz of water can be used to remove stubborn wrinkles.

, There are two basic ways to frame baby clothes, which will be covered in the next two sections. It is mostly a personal choice as to the desired appearance of the finished display. However, you also needs to take into consideration the thickness of the clothes.


First, the parent can use a regular picture frame. This method can be used for very thin or small pieces of clothing. If the parent chooses to use this method for framing larger baby clothes, only a small section of the clothing will be visible. Very thick clothes do not work well in this type of frame because they are too bulky when folded to fit the frame. Using a picture frame is covered in Method 2.
Another way to frame baby clothes is to use a shadow box with a glass front. This will display the entire front of the article of clothing and can even be used to display an entire outfit. This is also the better method for framing baby clothes that are thick and hard to fold. Using a shadow box is covered in Method 3.

"
"
Choose which side of the clothing you wish to display.,
Pick the right sized frame.,
Purchase a piece of matte backing board.,
Attach the item of clothing to the backing board.,
Consider displaying hats and other smaller items.",How to Frame Baby Clothes2," When using this method, you will need to decide what view or part of the clothing you want to display.


For example, when framing a shirt, the preferred view is usually the front or back of the shirt, depending on designs or images that may be on the article of clothing.

, You should try to purchase a picture frame that is the right size. The best way to tell what size is needed is to fold the sleeves and other parts of the shirt (or other article of clothing) to make it a rectangle with only the desired display section visible on top. You will then need to measure the edges of the folded article of clothing. These measurements will need to coincide closely with the measurements of glass that is visible.


It is important not to use the measurements of the outer edge of the frame because doing so would cause part of the article of clothing to be hidden inside the edges of the picture frame.
If a frame of the exact size is not available, it is better to choose one that is slightly larger and expand the displayed area of the shirt or article of clothing.

, Purchase a section of matte backing board from a craft store. The article of clothing needs to be unfolded and then refolded around the matte backing board so that the desired display view is centered on the backing board.

, In order to keep it from sliding around or drooping in the frame, the article of clothing can be pinned or tacked in place with a needle and thread. Using tape or other adhesives could cause discoloration or damage to the piece of clothing. Once the piece of clothing is attached to the matte backing board, it can be gently inserted into the frame and the framed article of clothing can be hung on a wall.

, A picture frame can still be used if the piece of clothing is a hat or other small item that cannot easily be folded into a rectangle. In this situation, the piece of clothing can be centered in the middle of the matte backing board, which will serve as a backdrop.


In fact, several smaller pieces of clothing can make a very interesting display when they are arranged within a single, slightly larger picture frame.

Understand the benefits of using shadow boxes instead of picture frames.,
Choose the right sized shadow box.,
Mount the clothing to the shadow box’s backboard.,
Check the positioning of the clothing before sealing the box.",How to Frame Baby Clothes3," Using a shadow box is similar to using a picture frame. The main difference is that there is no need to fold away parts of the clothing in order to display other parts more prominently.


Another bonus for using a shadow box is the fact that it is much deeper than a picture frame. This can give your display an interesting three dimensional look. For example, puffy sleeves on a dress can be slightly filled with tissue paper in order to give a fuller, more natural shape to them. If tissue paper is used for filler, it should be white so that it is less detectable. If colored tissue paper is used, there is a possibility of the color bleeding onto the clothing.

, In order to purchase a shadow box that is the right size, lay out the clothing the way you want it to be displayed. Measure the clothing once it is laid out. It is important to add at least an inch to every side so that there is a perimeter of the shadow box backboard showing around the clothing.


The backboard in most shadow boxes is lined with felt that may come in various colors. Choose one that compliments the clothing yet is subtle enough that it does not draw the attention away from the clothing.

, There are usually instructions about how to properly open the shadow box so that it is not damaged. Once it is open, the backboard can be easily pulled out so that the clothes can be mounted.


The clothing should be mounted to the backboard in the way that it is to be displayed. This can be done with pins. You can also gently tack the clothing in place, or sew it in place with thread.
If an entire outfit is being displayed, parents often leave spaces between the pieces to mimic where the baby’s head or other body parts would be if the outfit was worn.

, Before sealing the clothing inside the shadow box, stand the backboard against a wall to see how well the clothing stays in place. Look at it from several angles to be sure that it has the desired appearance.


If everything is fine, the backboard with the attached clothing can be reinserted into the shadow box. Close the shadow box and hang it on the wall.

"

Hang the frame or shadow box on a nail.,
Avoid overcrowding the wall.,
Don’t place the clothing in a location where it will be exposed to direct sunlight.",How to Frame Baby Clothes4," The framed clothes should be hung on a nail that is firmly in the wall to prevent it from falling if it is bumped. The parent could use wall anchors to give additional support, especially when displaying larger shadow boxes.

, If more than one picture frame or shadow box will be displayed in the same room, it is important to space them out so that they do not look crowded and make the overall display unattractive.

, It is important to avoid hanging framed clothing where it will be exposed to direct sunlight. Aside from the fact that the sunlight would reflect on the glass and make the clothing difficult to view, the glass can magnify the sunlight and cause discoloration to the clothes over time.

Understand that some people oppose baby walkers.,
Be aware that your baby could become dependent on the walker for support.,
Keep your baby’s feet out of the way.,
Know that there is a chance your baby could tip over.,
Keep the walker away from stairs.",How to Get Your Child to Use a Baby Walker," There are differing opinions on exactly when a baby is ready to use a baby walker. There is no set age, since all babies develop at their own rate. However, there are certain signs that indicate when the baby is ready to use a baby walker:


In order to use a baby walker, the baby should be able to sit up on their own and be able to crawl. Sitting up is necessary because the baby needs to sit up in the walker. The ability to crawl is important because the baby has to have some control over the movement of their legs in order to make the baby walker move.
Some parents wait to use a baby walker until after their baby begins to pull themselves up on furniture. This could be based on the idea that the baby walker will prevent the baby from bumping their head or getting hurt in some other way if they fall to the floor.;
, Due to the fact that baby walkers are meant to roll, several things need to be kept in mind whenever a baby is using one:


First of all, the floor needs to be smooth with no loose rugs that can catch on the wheels or bunch up beneath the walker. It is also a good idea to make sure that there is a wide open area so that the baby walker doesn't get stuck.
The parent should check the area for anything dangerous or fragile that will be within the baby's reach.
Any stairs should be blocked with a door or sturdy baby gate to prevent the baby from accidentally going down them in the walker. You can also use baby gates to block any rooms you want to prevent the baby from entering.
Make sure there are no sharp edges that your baby could run into. Remove or cover any sharp edges that are at the level of the baby's head.

, A baby walker should never replace parental supervision. In fact, parents should stay in the room with a baby that is using a walker to prevent them from getting stuck or injured. The added mobility can allow the baby to get to places and reach things that were not accessible while crawling.

, If the walker is used outside, the baby should wear shoes because the surfaces are rougher. Also, narrow sidewalks are not a good idea because the walker can tip over the edge and cause the baby to fall and get injured.

, Most babies are pretty easy and willing to be put into a baby walker, but some may be a little resistant. The resistant babies might just be having a bad day and not be interested in exploring something new, or they could possibly be afraid of it.


If they are really adamant about not going in the baby walker, the parent can sit on the floor near the baby walker and hold the baby on their lap so that they can see and touch it.
If there are toys on the baby walker, the parent can use an excited voice while playing with the toys in order to get the baby interested.

, When the baby is comfortable with the baby walker, whether at the initial try or after acclimating, the parent should gently lift the baby and lower them into the seat part of the baby walker.


It is important that each of the baby’s legs goes into a separate leg hole and that their toes do not get caught anywhere.
Once the baby’s bottom is resting in the seat of the walker, the parent needs to fasten the restraining belt because it will help to prevent the baby from sliding out of position.

, If the baby just sits in the walker, it is probably because they haven't yet realized their new ability to stand up without falling. One way to encourage the baby to stand is for the parent to hold the baby by the waist and stand them up and then move their hands away from the baby.


Another way a parent can encourage standing is to allow the baby to use the parent’s hands to pull themselves up. After several attempts, the baby will usually get the idea that it is safe to stand while in the baby walker.
Babies that are not attempting to stand on their own may just need a little more patience and encouragement from the parents.

, Learning to stand while in the walker is only half of the equation. In order for it to be purposeful, the baby still needs to learn how to get the walker to move.


For most, the initial movement is rather accidental. The excitement causes them to kick their feet and that motion thrusts the baby walker into action. However, other babies might still need a little help getting the walker to go.
Sometimes, holding a favorite food or toy in front of the baby in the walker will be enough encouragement for them to kick and move the walker. Other parents might find that they need to start off slowly and carefully pull the baby walker while the baby is in it.
If this is done, it is important that the parent keep an eye on the baby’s feet to be sure they aren't dragging or twisting their legs.

, Since this is totally new to the baby, their initial movements in the walker will be sudden and erratic. This motion might startle some babies, but gentle soothing and encouragement should keep them using the baby walker.


It usually takes a baby some time to be able to move in a particular direction or keep moving the walker for any length of time.
If the baby seems to be getting tired, or very frustrated, the parent should remove them from the baby walker and allow them to do something else.

, Although the baby walker can be a great tool in helping your baby to walk, too much time in the walker can have negative consequences.


For example, sitting in a walker only strengthens the muscles in the lower part of the baby's leg, but walking also requires strength in the upper leg muscles
It's important for the baby to practice crawling, as this helps to develop both arm and leg strength, and promote co-ordination. A baby who sits in a walker all day will be delayed in learning to crawl.
Although using the walker gives the baby confidence standing on their own two feet, the walking motion itself is different. In a walker, the baby moves only on the tips of their toes, whereas proper walking involves standing on the flats of the feet.

, There are many doctors that oppose the use of baby walkers and recommend that the parents do not use these products with their children.


Most of their opposition is due to the injury risks that are involved, but there can also be disadvantages in terms of the physical development of the baby.

, One disadvantage of using a baby walker is the possibility of the baby becoming dependent on the support it gives when they start to fall. As a result, the baby might not feel secure enough to stand and walk when they are not in the baby walker.


This could delay the baby’s ability to walk independently. In fact, it is possible that using a baby walker could cause the baby’s legs to strengthen more slowly, as they don not need to support the baby's full weight when in a walker.

, There is the possibility of the walker actually running over the baby’s feet. The baby’s feet can also get entangled on various parts of some walkers. This could result in bruises, abrasions, and possibly even broken bones if the walker continues to move while the feet are caught.

, An even more likely cause of injury is the wheels getting stuck, which causes the baby walker to stop moving. If the baby tries to force the baby walker to move, it could tip over and injure the baby.

, One of the worst possible incidences that might occur is if the baby walker is used near steps or some other raised surface. Babies in walkers are very quick and could tumble down the stairs or off the raised surface in an instant. This could cause very serious injuries.

Give the clothes to members of your extended family.,
Donate the clothes to charity.,
Take the outgrown baby clothes to be sold at resale stores.,
Bring the clothes to a second-hand store.,
Consider giving the clothes to a consignment shop.",How to Get Rid of Outgrown Baby Clothes1," If the parents do not plan on having more children they can pass their gently-used baby clothes on to their own siblings to be used for their nieces and nephews.


Some parents even pass outgrown baby clothes further to other relatives such as their own cousins that are expecting a child.
There is no guarantee that these family members will actually use the baby clothes for their own child, but they are highly likely to pass them on to someone that will use them.;
, There are many different organizations that collect gently used baby clothes and other items. Some of these organizations simply give these things to families that need them, such as families that were in a natural disaster.


There are other organizations that might sell the baby clothes in order to raise money for other things that they will give to needy families.
Organizations that take donations of gently used baby clothes can be found on the internet. Many of them have locations where the baby clothes can be dropped off. Some of the organizations will even come to the home to pick up the donated baby clothes and other items.

, For the best chance of having the clothes accepted by the store, they should be thoroughly cleaned, have no stains, no wrinkles, and no signs of wear and tear.


If possible, they should be brought to the stores on hangers. Neatly folding them and putting them in a container is also acceptable.
To make it easier for the store personnel to look through the clothing and make a decision, it is wise to group the clothing by size.
Other acceptable ways to group the clothing are by wearer gender or by season.

, A second-hand store will pay a small price for any items that they feel they can sell to other customers.


There might be immediate payment, or the store might need to have a day or so to examine the clothes and choose which they want to sell in their store. The staff keeps a file for each family that brings in things to sell so that there is no mix-up.
If there are clothes that the staff does not choose to accept for sale in the store, it is the responsibility of the family to take these items back.

, Consignment shops work a little differently from second-hand stores. One of the main differences is that the family does not receive the money until after the clothes are actually purchased.


Sometimes the wait can be long, but often the amount of money that is paid for clothes at a consignment shop is higher than what would be paid at a second-hand store.
Consignment shops are often a bit more particular about what they will accept for their store. For example, they might only accept clothes that are currently popular styles or were made by well-known children’s clothing companies.

Sell clean, gently-worn baby clothes outside your own home.,
Make sure the clothes are presented well.,
Use signs and advertisements to attract more customers.,
Be flexible about prices.,
Be prepared for adverse weather conditions.",How to Get Rid of Outgrown Baby Clothes2," Outgrown baby clothes can be sold right outside the family home. Of course, the money that is earned will not be near what was paid for the clothes when they were new, but some parents find the extra little bit of cash helpful.


In order to maximize the sales and possibly the profit, the family needs to be sure that the clothing is in the best condition. It should be clean which includes having no stains. The clothing should not show signs of wear and tear. They should also be free of wrinkles so that they look nicer.
The best rule of thumb for selling used baby clothing is to look at it from the buyer’s point of view and decide if it is in good enough shape to purchase.

, Another key aspect to selling baby clothes is how they are presented to the buyers. Tossing all of the baby clothes in boxes or containers does not make an appealing presentation.


At stores, the clothing is neatly folded and arranged on tables or hung on hangers, so the family should try to do something similar. If the clothes are folded and put on a table, they should be a bit spread out so that they are easier to look at.
Of course, the neatly arranged clothes on a table are likely to get disrupted, but it is not difficult to tidy them up throughout the yard sale time.
In order to simulate a store even more, it is also a great idea to have bags available. After a purchase is made, the family can put the bought clothes in the bag so they can be more easily carried by the buyers.

, Yard sales work for many families, but they can also be a disappointment if the sale location is off the main path and no one stops to look at the items.


In order to help get potential customers, the family can post signs in the neighborhood or even put an advertisement in a local newspaper. It is very important to include the address, date, and time span for the sale so that people know where and when it is.
If the location is on a small side street, it can be helpful to also list the name of the closest main street that connects to the side street.

, For a yard sale, the family determines the cost of the items they are selling, but often leave a bit of bargaining room for those customers that want to make a deal. Prices can either be on signs or on tags that are gently attached to the clothing.

, One major concern with selling the outgrown baby clothes in a yard sale is the weather. Advertising has to be done in advance in order to give customers a chance to plan ahead to come to the yard sale, but the weather isn’t known for certain very far in advance.


For areas where the weather often varies, a secondary date should be chosen for the sale and listed at the bottom of the advertisements.

Save the outgrown clothes for siblings.,
Display the clothes in your home.,
Use the clothes to make a patchwork quilt.",How to Get Rid of Outgrown Baby Clothes3," Often when a couple is just beginning their family, they will put away the outgrown baby clothes that are still nice and save them for the other children that they plan to have. This is a great way to cut back on the cost of baby clothes for the future siblings.


In order to be sure that the baby clothes are in the best condition when they are needed for the future siblings, they should be laundered and dried before storing.
They should be folded neatly and stored in dresser drawers or clothes storage containers. It is important that they are not stored where sunlight reaches them because it can cause fading.

, This is usually only done with favorite articles of baby clothing. The parents can display the clothes inside picture frames or shadow boxes and hang them in the child’s room as decoration.


As with storing the clothes for later use, framed baby clothes need to be clean and dry before being framed. There are many different ways to frame baby clothes. The clothing can be folded and inserted in a picture frame with only a certain portion visible. For example, a shirt can be folded the same way that men’s dress shirts are packaged at stores in order to show the front of the shirt in the picture frame.
Another way to frame the outgrown baby clothing is to use a shadow box. These boxes are deeper so the clothing does not get flattened. Shadow boxes can be purchased in large enough sizes to accommodate an entire outfit or several different clothing pieces together, such as 2-3 favorite tops.
Since a shadow box can be heavier than a picture frame, it is important to be sure the nail or hook is very secure in the wall in order to support it.

, Pieces of outgrown baby clothes can also be used as part of a patchwork quilt for the child’s bed when they are older. The parents should be sure the clothing is clean and that the swatches do not include worn out spots that may cause the blanket to tear more easily when used.

Pick names of famous figures.,
Avoid the names of people whose lives haven’t turned out well.,
Look to religion.,
Name your child after meaningful places and times.,
Pick a name based on a character trait.,
Consider initials.,
Work backwards from the translation.,
Use your foreign language skills.,
Research the meaning of names you like.,
Check how popular the name is.,
Be cautious about popular culture.,
Consider nicknames.,
Remember your child won’t always be a baby.,
Run names by friends and family.",How to Find a Symbolic Baby Name," Naming your child after your grandparents, uncles, and aunts is a way to make that person live on in the next generation. It ties your child’s name into the heritage of your family. Thus, this is a way to make your baby’s name symbolic both of a person who you admire and your family more generally.


Sometimes family names have become outdated and would sound off-putting in the modern world. One way to deal with this is to give your child a middle name that comes from within the family. This will keep the name alive, without forcing your child to identify with a name that might not fly on the playground.;
, It is dangerous to name kids after modern celebrities, because so many people do this, your kid might arrive at school to find that they are one of many in the class with their name.Instead, look back to older figures and characters that have a strong, timeless resonance.


Consider naming your child after famous historical figures. Popular names like Anthony and Cesar come from Roman history. Plenty of women have been named Elizabeth after England’s greatest Queen.You could name a daughter Rosa after Rosa Parks, George after George Washington, or Martin after Martin Luther King.
Alternatively, pick the names of a literary character in classic books and myths., Though it might seem silly, certain names are received badly by people and shape the lives of those named in detrimental ways. Names are often associated with particular classes and social groups.Thus, if you know several people with a name whose lives have gone downhill, be aware that it might have developed a negative connotation.


Although it is difficult to discern how much of this has to do with the name as compared to the families that would give a particular name, there is a strong correlation between names and success. An Eleanor is 100 times more likely to go to Oxford than a Jade., An incredible number of names have religious origins. Even minor religious characters have important symbolic resonance because they are generally part of a parable that conveys a deeper philosophical message. Picking a religious name can be a way to convey your beliefs, traditional culture, or the power of a story.


Some of the most popular Biblical names include: Jacob, Ethan, Noah, Michael, Daniel, Matthew, Elijah, James, Benjamin, Joshua, and David.When picking a name like this, consider going back and reading the story from which it is derived. Is the message something that you approve of? Do you agree with the person’s action and character? Would you like your child to follow that example?

, When will the baby be born? Was there a time that was particularly important to you as parents? You could pick the name of a month or season, like April or Summer. You could also pick the baby’s birthplace or a place that was important to your relationship. Names like Paris and Brooklyn are popular., Common English words can be adapted into baby names. Consider, for example, Hope, Patience, and Destiny. Though some of these names might be a little bit unusual, their symbolism will be much easier to recognize than names derived from distant Latin roots.

, Some initials might have symbolic undertones. They could be shared with a family member or a famous individual. They could also, however, be a name of their own. Initials can be used much the same way that nicknames are used.


Some initials that are easy to adapt into nicknames include A. J., C. J., D. J., J. D., J. J., J. P., J. R., J. T., M. J., R. J., and T. J., There are now websites that allow you to search for names based on a meaning. Find a word that has symbolic importance to you and search for it. You'll be presented with a list of names that are, in some measure, based on this word.


The search functions can have trouble connecting phrases to words. So begin with a search for a single, meaningful word and review the options that appear.
For example, instead of searching for “light bearer” search for “light.” The second will give you more options, some of which might have meanings you like but never would have thought of on your own.

, If you know any foreign languages, think about names in those languages, or English language names that are derived from those languages. Does the name have a meaning that resonates with you? If you don’t like the name, but like the meaning, think of other names that sound similar. They might have a shared root and similar meaning.

, Typically, it is best to start with names that sound good with your last name, and then see if you like the translation and deeper significance. Most people won’t research the deeper meaning of your kid’s name, but everyone will know how it sounds.


Write write write! Use a legal pad and pencil to start a list of names. After you have a good list of nice sounding names, start looking into what they mean online.
You should typically avoid first names, for example, that rhyme with your last name., A name might sound original and new to you, but it is possible that it is on your mind because you’ve heard it lately, even if you don’t remember where. There are websites that allow you to find out how common a name is. You probably want to pick a name that won’t make your kid stand out too much, but also won’t make him one of five in the classroom.These websites also include information about change over time. This can be important. If a name was popular when you were young, but has been losing popularity since then, it might have acquired a negative connotation or make your child sound twenty years older than she is.

, The names of celebrities, celebrities' children, and characters in movies and television shows can quickly pick up steam. Even without realizing it, you could be influenced by the names that you hear in popular culture. Unfortunately, so will many other people and they are liable to give their children the same name.

, Remember children will rarely be called by the full name all the time. You also might not have control over what nicknames kids at school will decide to use. Think about how the name might be abbreviated. Do you like the way these sound? Could they be unflattering?, Some names sound cute for a baby, but when was the last time you saw a baby working at a legal firm? Does the name sound as good for a professional as it does for a child?, You never know how a name will be received until you float it to people who know or care. You won’t know, for example, that everyone will mispronounce the name until you give your friends and family a chance to show how much difficulty they will have with it. These people might also be helpful in pointing out unflattering nicknames and initials that you might have missed."

",How to Give Your Baby a Hawaiian Name,",


Look beyond the traditional internet naming sites and seek early records of settlements that existed before the European scourge of disease decimated the native population. Heavily consider resurrecting some names that have lain quiet for decades, if not centuries. Give voice to these once more.
Read online histories of Hawaii and pick out names of interest.
Look into the IMDB (International Movie Data Base) for the names of characters that are in movies set in Hawaii. Check for movies shot on-location in Hawaii. This will help to narrow your choices.
Alternatively, look in Wikipedia for the cast of such movies.
The online resources are extensive and can easily be expanded if you use your imagination coupled with logic.

, Historical books of an epic nature such as Hawaii by James Michener are great sources of those light bulb moments. Pick out names of interest, those that have special meaning to you, or those that remind you of a character you'd like your child to be like.


You can search the internet, specifically Amazon.com and the online card catalog for your local library. Scan the summaries for interesting names.
Get Sparks Notes for books set in Hawaii and scan them for the coolest names.

, You know the one -- with Jack Lord and the famous line, ""Book 'em Danno!"" Again, pick out names that resonate.

, If you have a few traditional names -- either ones you particularly like or ones in your family -- feel free to Hawaiian-ize them! Here's a short list of Western names and their Hawaiian counterparts to give you an idea:


Alex -- Alika

Brandon -- Palanakonu

Danielle -- Kaniele

James -- Kimo

Mark -- Maleko

Rachel -- Leikela

Sam -- Kamuela

Theodore -- Keokolo

Zachary -- Kakali


, Make a list of candidates for both boys and girls.

, Do online research on the meanings of the Hawaiian names and rule out any that lack appeal in this respect. Just cross them off your list of candidates.


For example, Keano means cool breeze in Hawaiian. Variants are Keanu or Keeno. If these do not appeal to you, cross the name off of your list.

, Talk it over with your spouse or domestic partner, your parents, the in-laws. They may supply input which will shape your decision.


Bringing additional people into the decision-making can be beneficial in tightening family bonds or it can be a nightmare, so implement this step at your own discretion.

, If you already know the gender of your baby, make one list. If the gender will be a surprise, make two short lists.

, It could be the American standard of two names - a first name and a middle name - or it could be more. Some Spanish names are quite long.


Consider pairing the names, too. Write down every possible combination your name in groups. Each group should have the number of names you have chosen.

, Then, order the combinations from favorite to least favorite, but do not finalize a name just yet. Sit on it and let your subconscious mind mull over the name combinations.


Review the list every few days or weeks to familiarize yourself with the choices

, Make sure to choose a name that fits your new baby's looks and temperament.

Meet their basic needs.,
Talk to them.,
Give them your undivided focus.,
Visit them often.,
Make eye contact.",How to Get Babies to Like You1," The first and most essential way to earn a baby’s trust and get into their good graces is by meeting their basic needs. This means making sure they are fed, clean, and well rested. If the baby you are spending time with is in a sour mood, try feeding them, changing their diaper, or rocking them to sleep., Babies love the sound of people talking. You can talk about anything! Tell them your life story, read them a book, or describe what is happening around you. The sound of your voice is very soothing to the baby. Additionally, if they grow accustomed to your voice, they will be more likely to remember you the next time you come by., To be honest, hanging out with a baby can be a little boring. It may be tempting to look at your phone, watch television, or take on some other task while you are spending time with the baby. But if you can give the baby your undivided focus, even for a little while, they will respond to it and grow to love your company.Rather than giving them half of your attention all of the time, it is better to give them complete focus some of the time. Then at other moments, you can let someone else take the baby while you complete a task.

, Babies do not have very developed memories. As they work to build foundational life skills, they will actually recall very little about the details. As a result, they can only remember people who they see often. If you want to win over a particular baby, try to spend as much time around them as possible., After babies are about eight weeks old, they will begin making eye contact. Babies love looking into your eyes. They do not experience the same self-consciousness that adults sometimes do during extended eye contact. Instead they feel a connection with the person looking at them."

Play peek-a-boo.,
Make funny faces.,
Bring a puppy.,
Sing.,
Take them outside.",How to Get Babies to Like You2," Peek-a-boo is a classic baby game that requires nothing but your own two hands. Cover your eyes to disappear and then reappear with an exuberant “peek-a-boo!” The baby will almost certainly smile and laugh, and as a result grow to like you. Babies seven months or older will begin to play peek-a-boo by themselves., Babies also respond well to silly faces. Even very little babies will find joy in the funny faces you can make. Be creative and weird with the faces you make, and see if you can make them laugh. Very soon, the baby will be love having you around., There are few things that a baby loves as much as a puppy. If you have a puppy (or any gentle family pet) that you can bring over to play with the baby, you are sure to brighten the baby’s day.Always be careful and alert when bringing animals around babies.
Select an animal that could cause little harm and/or one that has been adequately trained.
Make sure animals have their required shots before bringing one around a baby.
Make sure the baby's parents approve any pets you bring over.

, Babies are naturally drawn to rhythms and melodies. You can win a baby’s affection by singing to them. You can choose simple children’s songs, popular songs that you know, or make up any old melody, and the baby will love to spend time with you., Fresh air and sunshine can do wonders for a baby’s mood. Take a baby outside to score points with them. The vitamin D in sunlight can make a baby very happy, and the wonderful colors and smells of the outdoors can provide myriad sensory experiences.Make sure to talk to the baby's parents on what protective clothing or sunscreen may be used to keep the baby safe from sunburn.

Bring them toys.,
Share your food.,
Mirror their mood.,
Teach them.,
Let them help you.",How to Get Babies to Like You3," Every body loves to receive gifts, and babies are no exception. Bring a baby an age appropriate toy to get them to like you. Search for fun, non-electronic, interactive toys for that baby’s age group. Then use that toy to play with them!, If the baby in question is over six months old, and if their parents have already introduced solid foods, sharing a little bit of what you are eating can be a fun and easy way to make the baby happy and get them to like you. Excellent foods for sharing with a little baby are bananas or other very soft fruit. Always check with the parents to see which foods are allowed and what size bites are safe.

, Babies are surprisingly adept at accessing a person’s mood. You can foster a connection with the baby by taking on whatever mood they seem to be in. If they seem fussy, you may want to make fussy faces back at them. If they are cheerful, respond in kind. These small gestures of empathy can lead to the baby enjoying your company., Babies love to learn. Anytime you play with them, it can be a great opportunity for learning. You can teach them about the ABCs while playing with blocks, you can practice new words as you walk through the garden, or you can teach them the sounds of different animals when you play with stuffed animals. If you make an effort to teach them, babies will grow to love you.

, Babies as young as eight months old can start to be helpful around the house. If a baby is able to hold small objects, they can begin helping you clean up their toys. If they are mobile (crawling or walking), they can help even more. Even though a task will almost certainly take longer with a baby’s help, allowing a baby to help gives them a sense of belonging and pride. It is building a good foundation for them, and as a result, it will encourage them to like you.

Calm a flustered baby by rubbing or patting the baby's back. Babies who are hungry and upset are more likely to gulp air, which causes hiccups.;
, Keep the baby in a semi-upright position during feedings and for up to 30 minutes after.Staying upright can relieve pressure on the baby's diaphragm.

, Burping the baby can release some of the hiccup-causing gas in his or her stomach. Place the baby upright across your chest so the baby's head is on or a little above your shoulder.


Rub or gently pat the baby's back. This helps the bubbles of gas to move.
Resume feeding after the baby burps, or wait a few minutes if the baby does not burp.

, If you hear gulping noises, the baby may be eating too quickly and swallowing air. Swallowing excess air can cause an infant's stomach to distend, leading to hiccups. Take frequent breaks to slow the feeding session., The infant's lips should cover the areola, not just the nipple. An insecure latch can cause the baby to swallow air.

, This allows air in the bottle to rise to the bottom and away from the nipple. You may also want to consider using collapsible bag inserts for the bottle that are designed to reduce air swallowing.

, If the hole is too big, the formula will flow too quickly, and if it is too small your baby will grow frustrated and gulp air. If the hole is the proper size, a few drops should come out when you tip the bottle., Doctors often advise feeding the infant more frequently, but for shorter lengths or for smaller amounts at time. When a baby is fed too much in one sitting, the stomach distends too quickly, which can cause the diaphragm muscle to spasm. , Burp before you switch breasts if you are breastfeeding. Burp after the baby eats 2 to 3 ounces (60 to 90 ml) if you are bottle-feeding. Pause to burp or stop feeding if the infant stops nursing or turns his or her head away.


Burp more frequently if you are feeding a newborn, as newborn infants will eat less in one sitting. Newborns usually feed eight to 12 times a day., Feed your infant as soon as they seem hungry. A calm baby will eat more slowly than a hungry, worked up baby. A baby may also swallow excess air during a crying fit.


Signs of hunger might include crying, mouth movements such as sucking motions, or restlessness., Write down the time and duration of each hiccup episode. Keeping track of when the baby experiences hiccups can help you determine if there is a common pattern and help you focus your efforts to relieve the hiccups. Note whether the hiccups occurred during or shortly after feeding. Scan your notes and look for triggers., Most hiccups will go away on their own. Hiccups are often less disturbing to infants than they are to adults. If your baby seems bothered by the hiccups, is not feeding normally, or is not growing normally, see a doctor., If an infant is regularly hiccuping for over twenty minutes, this can be a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)Other symptoms of GERD include spitting up and fussiness.
A pediatrician may be able to prescribe medicine or provide recommendations on how you can help your baby cope with GERD.

, If you hear wheezing or the baby's breathing seems to be otherwise obstructed, take the infant to a doctor right away.

Take note of unexplained constipation.,
Listen to your baby's breath to catch any abnormalities.,
Notice poor feeding and loss of appetite.,
Identify floppy or clumsy movements.,
Look for droopy eyelids.,
Understand the meaning of excessive drooling.,
Recall if the baby has been exposed to dirt and dust.,
Remember if the baby has ingested honey or was fed honey.,
Seek medical help if you suspect that your baby has botulism.",How to Recognize Infant Botulism1," This is first sign of your baby being infected with botulism.


If your infant has gone more than 3 days without defecating, it indicates your baby is constipated.
Although constipation can be sign of botulism infection, it can also be due to inadequate feeding.
It usually takes 18 to 36 hours for the symptoms to take effect after infection.;
, During botulism infection, your baby may exhibit unusually slow or rapid breathing.


This is because when the toxin travels all over the baby's system, it can affect any of the exposed organs, including the respiratory system.
Sometimes, it can cause respiratory muscle paralysis, which is a fatal condition.

, If your baby is unwilling to eat or unable to suckle properly, he or she may be suffering from botulism.


Toxic substances produced by C. botulinum can affect the infant’s sucking mechanism and manifest as poor feeding behavior.
The toxin can block nerve functions, leading to muscular paralysis in the mouth.

, Uncoordinated or floppy movements can be a symptom of botulism in infants.


This is also a result of muscle weakness due to the paralysis induced by botulism toxins present in the body.

, If your baby's eyelids look low and droopy, and it is not time for them to sleep, this could indicate the presence of a botulism infection.


This is another symptom of the neurotoxin that can create systemic muscle weakness throughout the baby's body.
If the eyelid muscles are not functioning properly, the eyelids will droop and may even shut.

, If your baby drools excessively, this indicates the presence of botulism's neurotoxin creating weakness in the esophageal muscle and making the infant unable to swallow properly.


However, if your baby is drooling a normal amount, don't worry.
Drooling from botulism is uncontrollable, as if the baby cannot stop the drool no matter what he or she tries to do.

, Botulinum spores are mostly carried by dust and dirt.


If your baby has ingested infected dust or dirt, the botulinus will grow and multiply on the infant’s large intestine, developing neurotoxins.
If the infant has been exposed to an environment full of dust and dirt, there is a high chance that your infant has acquired botulism.

, Honey is a primary source of botulinum spores. If ingested, the spores can release bacteria that are toxic to the human body.


You should never feed honey to babies that are less than 12 months old, as they don’t have the capability to fully digest the spores.
This makes them susceptible to botulism spore germination.

, Once you suspect that your baby has infant botulism, it is best to go to the hospital and get confirmation.


If you noticed any of the previously mentioned symptoms, even 1 or 2, don’t hesitate to seek medical care, as this medical condition can easily be treated and has a good prognosis if immediate medical intervention is received.
However, if you delay, your baby could suffer severe and even fatal complications.

"
Provide a history of your baby's illness to your pediatrician.,
Calm your child while the doctor performs a physical examination.,
Wait for laboratory tests and analysis.",How to Recognize Infant Botulism2," Your physician will inquire about the history and development of your baby's illness, so make sure to have that information readily available.


This includes the situation surrounding the development of the symptoms.
Certain conditions may help the physician determine whether or not your child has botulism, and how they may have gotten it.

, You should help your pediatrician by trying to soothe your child while the doctor examines him or her.


By this time, the physician will have taken note of any obvious signs or symptoms of infant botulism.
She will check for the aforementioned signs and symptoms such as constipation, drooping eyelids, weak cry, difficulty feeding, and generalized weakness and paralysis.

, To confirm a case of infant botulism, your doctor will order laboratory tests.


Tests can be done on your baby's blood, vomit, or stool.
These tests will reveal the presence of toxins produced by the Clostridium botulinum.
Laboratory results may take more than a day to arrive, and since infant botulism can be fatal when not addressed promptly the doctor’s analysis may serve as the primary basis for early diagnosis.The preferred laboratory test is a stool culture.
However, the baby might be suffering from constipation and in this case, a colonic irrigation or enema will be performed with saline.
Toxin investigation is primarily done with blood as the specimen.
In some cases, to further improve the investigation, dust or soil from clothing, honey, or any suspected source of infection will be taken and examined to identify Clostridium botulism.

Spend time together on the floor.,
Support their trunk while helping them stand.,
Bounce and dance.,
Equip them with the proper footwear.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Stand1," One of the best ways to help your baby develop the ability to control their bodies and support themselves is by letting them spend time on their belly in areas where it’s safe to move around. The more they show interest in the world around them and try to begin using their arms and legs, the closer they will become to standing.Before your baby is able to support themselves on two legs alone, other types of movement help them prepare to do so. For instance, crawling, rolling, scooting, and creeping are all healthy and beneficial.
Place a baby that has shown interest in moving around on their belly. If they are able to get up onto their hands and knees or can otherwise move themselves, place a toy they enjoy touching and holding just out of their reach.;
, While playing with your baby, hold them around their chest, with one hand under each of their armpits. This is more developmentally beneficial than holding their hands or arms. More specifically, supporting their trunk helps them begin to learn how to use the muscles they will need to balance while standing., It’s the classic maneuver that many people default to when holding a happy energetic baby. Once babies are able to control the movement of their legs and arms, they often experiment with them non stop. Sit down and hold your baby facing you, with one hand under each of their armpits, and let their feet touch your lap. Don’t forget to play simple, rhythmic music as well - you’ll be surprised by how well they can groove, if only up and down.This activity is especially helpful for growing leg muscles and shifting weight from one leg to the other.

, Indoors, the best footwear is actually none at all. This is especially true if your baby will be allowed to play in rooms that have potentially slippery surfaces, such as wood or tile floors. Outdoors, however, you’ll want to get them into some shoes.Shop for baby shoes in the afternoon, as feet naturally swell a bit during the day, especially once your baby is walking.
When you check for a good fit, your baby should be standing up. Press the full width of your thumb between the tip of the shoe and the end of their toes, with enough room at the heel to squeeze your littlest finger in.
If they are able to walk on their own safely, let them do so for a few minutes. Remove the shoes and look for evidence of irritation. If there are any bothered spots, try a different pair.
Check the fit of your baby’s shoes every month. It will become a common theme: you’ll be surprised by how quickly your baby grows.

"
"
Designate an exploration area with helpful furniture.,
Place something for them to stand and reach for.,
Be patient.,
Give positive verbal support.,
Don’t get them a walker.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Stand2," As your baby is increasingly able to move around and otherwise control their body, set up a space where they can practice pulling themselves up. They will likely try to use anything they can grab onto to help them stand. Accordingly, make sure furniture and other items in the area do not have any dangerous edges, and are heavy enough to remain still if your baby grabs onto it to pull themselves upwards.Never leave a baby that is learning how to stand up unattended.

, Within a safe area in which your baby can practice pulling themselves up, provide small incentives for them to do so. For instance, place one of their toys on the couch and show your baby where it is. Then set them on the floor near the couch.This may interest your baby in approaching the couch and pulling themselves up.
Make sure not to try this on furniture or items that might move if your baby uses them to pull themselves up.
Note that some babies will be able to pull themselves up and reach for things before they’re able to sit themselves back down. In these cases, you may want to help them lower themselves back to the ground.
If your baby becomes adept at this game, place several items along the couch, to encourage them to scoot sideways while supporting themselves with their hands.

, To put it bluntly, parents often need to be reassured that their baby is developing totally normally. Normal, in fact, is different for every baby. While it’s important to have plenty of unrestricted play time with your baby, you’re unlikely to actually speed up their physical development.Focus on providing them safe opportunities to experiment moving around, and having fun when you spend time together.

, Encouragement not only motivates babies, it helps them develop a positive concept of themselves as they become children. It also helps facilitate a happy, healthy relationship between you and your baby. Simply say things like, ""good job!"" or ""try again"" in a calm, joyful tone., The more restricted your baby is, the less opportunity they have to learn how to move and stand. In short, babies should spend as much as time possible unrestrained. Once it seems like your baby is able to pull themselves up, you’ll probably want to help them get walking - but don’t get them a walker. These are not only potentially dangerous, they hinder your baby’s physical development and interest in walking outside of their walker.While items designed to hold your baby vertically seem to prepare your child to walk, they do not. Accordingly, stationary bouncing seats and other similar items should also be avoided.

Set the crib’s mattress lower.,
Prepare your home for a walking baby.,
Look for specific safety risks.,
Watch out for important potential concerns.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Stand3," As soon as you notice that your baby is beginning to sit up and move themselves around a bit, be sure that the crib walls are high enough to keep them contained once they’re standing.On many cribs, this means lowering the mattress deeper into the crib’s frame, but different cribs function a bit differently.
Ideally, the walls of the crib are taller than the baby is standing up. Some babies become surprisingly good as standing, and even climbing, faster than you’d expect.

, The more your baby learns about scooting, crawling, standing, and moving in general, the more aware you need to be of their surroundings. There are many important babyproofing steps you’ll need to take, including installing baby barriers, and removing almost everything from floor height in any room they will be allowed to explore.In particular, remove anything from the baby's reach and block off any areas that may be unsafe.

, Some things can sneak under even a vigilant parent’s attention when babyproofing a home. For instance, remove any tables that are about as tall as a standing baby, such as coffee tables, with any hard or otherwise dangerous edge. These alone are responsible for many baby injuries, often incurred while the baby is learning to stand.Similarly, those throw rugs need to go, along with anything else that might trip a tiny foot.
Even in rooms where you won’t intentionally be allowing your baby to explore, take precautions to prevent your baby from accessing anything harmful, such as chemicals.

, It’s important to keep in mind that every baby’s physical development happens a bit differently, despite a common general pattern. The time it takes to reach many developmental milestones, in particular, can vary significantly. That said, there are a few things to watch out for. If your baby shows no interest in moving around by the time they're nine or ten months old, or doesn’t try to stand when supported, mention this to your doctor.
Similarly, if progress in terms of your baby’s physical development is apparent, but they tend to favor one side of their body to the other, or don’t have good control of their hands, mention these observations to your doctor.

Compliment the baby.,
Offer tangible help.,
Learn about Down Syndrome.,
Listen.",How to React if Your Friend's Baby Has Down Syndrome," Your friend still has a new baby, and you still have an opportunity to celebrate new life.;
, These are not very helpful, and often carry insulting implications about the baby. Focus on the baby as an individual, or when using generalizations, generalize about all babies (not babies with Down Syndrome).


There's no need to pity them. (""I'm so sorry,"" ""God has given you this burden,"" ""You must be saints,"" etc.)
Positive stereotypes are also unhelpful. (""They're such happy children,"" ""They're so loving,"" ""God has given you a child forever,"" etc.)
Don't ask if the baby is high-functioning. It's rude to put disabled people in boxes; even more so when they are newborns.

, They may be worried about raising the child appropriately, handling health issues (heart and eye problems are common), and helping the child feel happy and supported. Tell them that they're going to be great parents. This will help them believe it.

, After all, they have a new baby. Statements of congratulations will convey acceptance, which is very important to the new parents. They will also love any gifts you can bring. Here are some examples:


Flowers (with a ""new baby"" theme, not an ""I'm sorry"" theme)
A cute outfit
Balloons
A stuffed animal
Baby accessories (e.g. a mobile, storybooks, pacifiers)

, Talk about how beautiful she is, and note any similarities to the parents. (""He has your nose."" ""She has your hair."") Parents love to hear about similarities between their baby and themselves. Don't be afraid to ask to hold her.

, Parents are probably reading everything they can about Down Syndrome, caring for any health complications the baby has, in addition to facing the normal challenges of a newborn baby. If you offer a specific form of help, they can relax a little more. It's best to give a concrete example of what you can do, since parents may be too out of it to answer ""What can I do to help?""


""I'll be bringing a meal on Sunday around six o' clock.""
""I can take his sisters out for pizza and a movie on Saturday afternoon.""
""The kids and I can come clean the house. Which day is best?""

Classify the temperature.,
Seek medical attention if baby's condition worsens.,
Seek attention immediately if baby doesn't improve in 48 hours.,
Check by age.,
Reduce clothing.,

Follow the correct prescription.,
Make the environment cool.,
Cover them with a light sheet.

",How to Reduce Body Temperature of a Baby,"


If the baby has a temperature of 37-37.5℃ (98.6 - 99.5℉), then it isn't regarded as fever. Remove some layers of clothing and, if appropriate, bedding. This can cool your baby down, particularly in warm weather. If the temperature comes down just from altering baby's clothing or bedding, there's no need to do anything further. If the baby is still hot, strip them down to their singlet, vest or a short-sleeved baby grow with no leggings section and a nappy or diaper. Cover him or her with a light, preferably cotton, sheet.If the temperature is 37.5-38℃ (99.5 - 100.4℉), then he or she isn't experiencing a fever either.A bath or shower with lukewarm (not cool) water can lower body temperature. Keep bedding and clothing light.
When the temperature is about 38-38.5℃ (100.4 - 101.3℉) then the baby is having a fever.Baby will need some medical attention in this case. Usually prescribed medicine can work. Go to doctor for a check up.
If the temperature is about 38.5-39℃ (101.3 - 102.2℉) then they will definitely need medication (such as infant paracetamol) to reduce their temperature.You can strip your baby down, and possibly give them a tepid bath for some improvement however medical attention is needed.
If your baby has 39-40℃ (102.2 - 104℉) then it needs immediate medical attention.The baby may be in danger of experiencing a 'fit' or a 'febrile convulsion'. Contact a doctor immediately! Infant febrile convulsions can be terrifying for a parent to witness. Try not to panic and remember that the fit is due to your baby being too warm and not any other more worrying illnesses or conditions.;
, This is especially critical if they have trouble breathing, become drowsy, refuse to drink, or are not peeing as often as usual. Other signs that you should seek urgent medical attention include baby appearing to have a stiff neck or a head ache, being sensitive to light or persistent vomiting., Again, this is especially critical if the baby's temperature reaches above 40°C (104℉).,


In children under 12 months, fever might be a sign of a more significant illness, and you should definitely seek medical advice.Babies under three months of age who develop a fever must be seen by a doctor immediately, because it’s harder to tell if they have a serious underlying illness., As usual make them wear light clothes.

, You can give them water. Don't allow a child to become dehydrated, offer fluid time to time. Water is best.

, Give liquid paracetamol in the correct and recommended dose. Giving more doses can damage a child's liver.

, Turn on the fan give them a cool bath.

Avoid scented products.,
Put on protective clothing.,
Apply a repellent with DEET if your baby is at least two months old.,
Use a product with picaridin.,
Consider commercially-produced natural repellents.,
Spray permethrin on clothing.,
Practice good application.,
Control your home environment.,
Keep your child away from mosquito-heavy areas.,
Drape netting over your baby’s carriers.,
Place lavender sachets or pillows in your baby’s room.,
Burn a citronella candle.,
Forget wristbands, zappers and ultrasonic devices.",How to Protect Babies from Mosquito Bites," Mosquitoes are attracted to the scents in many products such as soap, perfume, and even hair spray. Use unscented personal products to keep mosquitoes from attacking your baby. Consider smelling products before you use them or read the labels to ensure they’re unscented or only lightly scented., If you’re going to be in a mosquito-heavy area or outside for longer periods of time, dress your baby in loose, long-sleeved shirts and pants. Clothing can help prevent bites on its own or be used in conjunction with chemical or natural repellent products.Put moderately loose-fitting and light-colored fabrics on your baby. This can prevent bugs from biting through the clothing. Make sure that as much of your baby’s skin as possible is covered by the clothing. Have him or her wear long pants, long-sleeved, shirts, and closed toe socks or shoes. You may also want to protect your baby’s head with a hat.
Avoid bright or flowered-print clothing, which can attract mosquitoes., A chemical called DEET is considered by many medical professionals to be the best defense against mosquito and other bug bites.However, because of concerns about the safety of the specific concentration of DEET applied to children, you should use caution when using it on your baby. Do not use products with DEET on children younger than two months of age.Apply DEET-based products every two to five hours, depending on the concentration of DEET in the product. For example, a 10% DEET concentration will protect your baby for about two hours, while a 24% product can give your child about five hours of protection.Apply DEET sparingly to your baby, being sure to cover all exposed skin except areas too close to the eyes or mouth. Avoid putting it on any parts of your baby’s hands that may come in contact with his or her mouth or eyes.Avoid using any DEET product with a concentration of 30% or more. Many experts suggest sticking with a 10% concentration for safety. You should also avoid any DEET product with sunscreen, as the DEET can make the sunscreen ineffective and lead to sunburn and sunscreens need to be applied more frequently, which could lead to too much DEET exposure..
Avoid putting any product with DEET on a baby less than two months of age. Instead, consider natural repellents and securing the environment around the baby.Ask your doctor or medical professional if you have any questions about applying DEET on your baby.

, In 2005, the Centers for Disease Control recommended that products containing picaridin are as safe as those with DEET.Picaridin is a synthetic compound derived from the plant Piper, which is the same plant that produces table pepper.If you’re concerned about DEET, consider trying a repellent with picaridin on your baby. Be aware that the American Academy of Pediatrics has not issued any recommendations on using picaridin on babies, but you may want to use the same rule of thumb as with DEET: only use it on babies older than two months.


Buy products with picaridin at your local pharmacy, grocery store, large retailer, or outdoor store. Many companies such as OFF, Cutter Advanced, and Sawyer Premium have picaridin-based repellents.
Expect to get three to eight hours of protection depending on the concentration of picaridin in the product.Picaridin comes in concentrations ranging from 7% to 20%. Concentrations between 5% and 10% offer one to two hours of protection, while those at 20% offer four to five hours of protection. Higher percentages only offer slightly longer protection.Apply picaridin products only to exposed skin or skin under clothing through which a mosquito can pierce. Make sure to avoid putting it on the parts of your baby’s hand that come in contact with the mouth or eyes or too close to your baby's eyes or mouth., Companies are increasingly offering insect repellents that contain essential oils such as citronella, cedar, eucalyptus and soybean. Like picaridin, the Centers for Disease Control found some of these products products as effective as DEET at repelling mosquitos.Considering trying one of these natural products if you want to avoid harsh chemicals on your baby’s delicate skin. Read product labeling to determine age restrictions, as some of these products may not be suitable for babies or children under three.


Read the labels of products from California Baby, Buzz Away, and Bite Blocker to see the active natural repellents. Be aware that these products may also be non-toxic and hypoallergenic to help further protect your baby.You may need to reapply natural repellents every one and half to two hours to ensure maximum protection for your baby from mosquitos., Permethrin is another chemical repellent that can effectively repel mosquitoes. However, unlike other repellents, you cannot apply permethrin to skin. You should apply permethrin spray to clothing or any other outdoor equipment that your wears or uses.There are currently no age restrictions on products coated in permethrin. You may want to use the same guidelines as for DEET and other repellents and not expose your baby to permethrin if he or she is under two months old.Be aware that permethrin will stay on your baby’s clothing or any outdoor equipment even after several washes.

, You want to protect your baby in the best way with mosquito repellents. Making sure that you properly apply and remove chemical and natural repellents can ensure you protect your baby from bites as well as from ingesting potentially harmful chemicals.No matter what repellent you choose, use the following good application practices for your baby:


Avoid applying repellent to any baby under two months or on any wounds or cuts.
Read packaging and application instructions.
Spray repellents in open areas to prevent ingestion.
Avoid spraying on your baby’s face; instead, spray some on your hand and rub it on your baby’s face or consider a cream-based repellent instead.
Use just enough repellent to cover your baby’s skin and avoid reapplying unless necessary.
Remove any repellent from skin when your baby comes inside by washing it off with soap and water.

, Some environmental factors may help keep away insects. Controlling your environment through measures such as using fans and filling puddles can make it unappetizing for mosquitoes.Fix and replace any broken windows or window screens.
Put window, standing, or overhead fans in your baby’s room and throughout your home. Fans make it difficult for mosquitos to navigate through the air.Remove standing water from your yard because it can attract mosquitoes and promote their breeding. Empty birth baths, fill puddles, and cover pools., Wooded areas and stagnant water supplies, such as puddles and ponds, attract mosquitoes and encourage them to breed. Make sure your baby stays away from the following areas that attract mosquitoes:


Garbage cans
Puddles or other stagnant pools of water
Flowerbeds
Orchards., If you go outside or your home attracts a lot of mosquitoes, consider placing netting over your baby’s carriers and sleeping areas. Make sure to purchase netting with small enough holes to deter mosquitoes. You can find this type of netting and home and outdoor stores. Drape the netting over the following baby carriers:


Strollers
Car seats and carriers
Cribs
Playpens, You can heighten the effectiveness of netting, clothing and other measures by putting lavender sachets in your baby’s room. The sachets can deter mosquitoes from attacking your baby.Put dried lavender into little cloth bags or small pillowcases to make sachets. Buy dried lavender or dry some from a plant you may have for the sachets.
Place the sachets in strategic places a curious baby can’t reach. Consider in closets, chests, or other areas of your baby’s bedroom.

, There is evidence that the oil from citronella can keep mosquitoes and other bugs at bay.Consider burning citronella candles with a concentration of 5% to 10% in outdoor areas to help protect your baby—and the rest of your family.


Allow the candle to burn for as long as you are outside. Candle oils can evaporate quickly and leave you and your baby unprotected if you are outside.
Make sure to keep the candle safely away from your baby so that she doesn’t burn herself or inhale any fumes.

, Many companies promote the benefits of bug zappers, wristbands, and ultrasonic devices. They may not adequately protect your baby from mosquito bites and you should avoid using them. In addition, wristbands are often soaked in chemicals that can harm your baby if swallowed."

Recognize mild to moderate infant dehydration symptoms.,
Understand the symptoms of severe infant dehydration.",How to Prevent Infant Dehydration1," Fever, diarrhea, vomiting, hot weather conditions, and a decreased ability to drink or eat are some of the most frequent causes. Conditions such as cystic fibrosis or celiac inhibit food absorption and can also cause dehydration.Signs of dehydration in children include:Eyes may appear sunken.
There may be a decreased frequency of urination.
Urine is dark in color.
Soft spot on the front of the head in babies (called the fontanel) may appear sunken.
No tears come when the child cries
Mucous membranes (the lining of the mouth or tongue) appear dry or sticky.
The baby appears lethargic (less than normal activity).
There is more inconsolable crying or fussiness.;

An infant has a poor sucking reflex.
Your baby displays lack of interest in feeding.
Fewer wet diapers than normal appear.
Dry, parched skin spreads around the mouth area.
The baby has a dry mouth and lips.

, In cases of severe dehydration, medical attention is necessary. Contact a doctor right away if your child is severely dehydrated. Symptoms include:Few or no tears are produced when the baby cries.
No wet diapers appear in a six to eight hour period, or less than three in a 24 hour period, or if there is only a small amount of dark yellow urine.

Offer additional fluids in conditions that can lead to dehydration.Overheating or even a higher than normal ambient temperature can cause rapid water loss.,
Try supplementing fluid intake with water if the infant is over four months old.,
Contact your doctor or a lactation consultant if your breastfeeding baby is not able to latch on correctly.,
Discuss your concerns with your doctor if the baby is not interested in feeding.",How to Prevent Infant Dehydration2," Fever, diarrhea and vomiting can also lead to dehydration. These situations will require that you offer your child additional fluids.


Instead of feeding every few hours, feed every half hour.
Encourage the baby to nurse more frequently if breastfeeding.
Offer more frequent bottles with smaller portions of milk if you are bottle feeding.

, If the baby is not eating solid food yet, offer no more than four oz. You can provide more water if you've already introduced the baby to solids. Dilute juices with water if your older infant drinks juice.You can also offer your baby an electrolyte solution such as Pedialyte, Rehydralyte, or Enfalyte.

, If your baby cannot feed properly, dehydration is a real risk. A baby's lips should be around the areola of the breast, not just the nipple. If you hear loud noises like air being sucked, the baby may not be able to get good suction on the breast. A professional can help diagnose and provide strategies to resolve nursing problems.

, Keep track of the number of dirty and wet diapers the infant produces per day and how much/how often the baby is feeding. Your doctor can use this information to evaluate whether the baby is getting enough fluids."

Keep the baby in the shade while outdoors.This will also help to protect his skin.",How to Prevent Infant Dehydration3," Generally, touch is the ideal way to check your child's temperature. If the skin is hot and sweaty, this indicates the infant is too warm. Overheating can cause infant dehydration., By giving your baby a cool environment, you will help minimize loss of water. Higher ambient temperatures have also been connected to SIDS. Research shows that infants exposed to an average temperature of 84 °F (28.9 °C) degrees were more than twice as likely to die suddenly than those in an average temperature of 68 °F (20 °C).Pay attention to the temperature in the infant's room with a thermometer.
Get an air-conditioner in the summer.
Don't overheat your house in the winter.

, Don't swaddle the baby in a heavy blanket if the home is overly warm, even if it is cold outside. Overheating due to heavy coverings has been connected to SIDS.Do not bundle your child up when she is sleeping.
Dress infants in weather-appropriate clothing.
Avoid heavy fabrics, jackets, fleece hats, and long sleeves and pants in hot weather, unless the clothes are made of a breathable material.

, Get a stroller with an adjustable shade. Get a portable sun shade if you will be somewhere very sunny, such as the beach. Put a window shade in your car to protect your baby from the sun while you're driving.

Take extra care to keep your baby hydrated during illness.,
Watch to see if the baby is swallowing fluids.,
Use an oral rehydration solution (ORS).,
Get prompt medical attention if the baby is ill and suffering from severe dehydration.",How to Prevent Infant Dehydration4," Babies experiencing fever, diarrhea or vomiting are more likely to become dehydrated. Increase the frequency of times you offer the baby breastmilk or formula. Offer smaller portions if your baby is vomiting.


For a vomiting baby, this may even mean feeding clear fluids with a medicine syringe or spoon with only five to ten ml per feeding every five minutes. Your doctor can advise you on how much and how often to feed your baby.

, A baby with blocked sinuses or throat pain due to illness may have difficulty swallowing. In this situation it will be necessary to address the blockage.


Discuss the use of infant pain medication with a pediatrician if your baby doesn't want to swallow due to throat pain.
Administer infant saline drops to the baby to flush sinuses if the infant is congested and us a bulb syringe to remove mucus. Discuss proper use with your health practitioner, and get additional treatment if the baby's condition does not improve or becomes more serious.

, These are specially designed to help hydrate infants, and it will help replace the water, sugars and salts your baby has lost.Do this according to a doctor's directions if the infant is not able to keep down fluids and experiences persistent diarrhea and vomiting. Alternate between breastfeeding and offering the ORS if you have a nursing infant. If you use formula, discontinue the use of formula and any other drinks while using the ORS.


Common brands are Pedialyte, Rehydralyte, and Enfalyte.

Limit the amount of coffee, cola, and herbal teas you drink if you are breastfeeding.",How to Prevent Infant Diarrhea," All caregivers should practice diligent hand washing and you should also wash the infant's hands. Always wash hands after changing or adjusting diapers and before and after food preparation. This can help stop the spread of viruses and bacterial infections.


Run warm water.
Moisten hands, and rub with soap for at least 15 seconds.
Rinse with warm water.;
, Diarrhea is highly contagious. A person experiencing diarrhea could touch a surface that you or the baby may touch. You can easily spread diarrhea causing viruses or bacteria by touching your baby's face or mouth. Babies also like to put their fingers and hands into their mouths.

Disinfect kitchen counters and appliances, bathroom fixtures and changing areas daily.






Clean baby toys regularly. This is especially important if other children have touched the toys.







, Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea in babies and small children. A pediatrician's office will usually administer the multi-dose oral vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months of age.

, Juices can loosen stools and cause or worsen diarrhea. Infants should not drink more than 4 oz. (118.3 ml) of juice daily.

, If you mix infant formula with too much or not enough water, it can cause diarrhea in infants.


Be precise when you measure how much formula and water to use.
Double check the directions on the formula package if you switch brands or need to use a new formula temporarily to make sure you use the correct amount of water.

, You can feed infants over 6 months old dairy products made from whole milk, but you should not feed younger infants yogurt. The live cultures can help decrease the length and severity of a diarrheal episode.

, Diarrhea may occur if your baby has a reaction or intolerance to a specific food or foods.


Introduce solid foods 1 at a time. Wait 3 days to see if the baby shows any adverse reactions.
Note which foods the baby does not tolerate well or any foods that cause an allergic reaction in the baby. You can have a pediatrician or allergist follow up with allergy testing to confirm your observations.
Stop feeding these foods to the baby.
Cut trigger foods from your diet if you are a breastfeeding mother as allergens in your diet may affect the baby.

Recognize the signs of whooping cough.",How to Protect Your Baby from Whooping Cough," You can help protect your baby from whooping cough by getting vaccinated during your pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that every woman get the vaccine for whooping cough between their 27th and 36th weeks of pregnancy. This can help pass some protective antibodies to your unborn baby.Recognize that the vaccine booster for whooping cough, or pertussis, is called Tdap, which stands for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis.This is different than DTaP, which is the vaccine for children under seven.
Ask your doctor the best time to get vaccinated during your third trimester.;
, One of the best ways to protect your baby from whooping cough is through cocooning. This means the only people who come into contact with your baby are vaccinated individuals.This is especially important because your baby is most likely to catch whooping cough from someone in your home. Ask friends and family members if they’ve kept up with their Tdap vaccine. Only let vaccinated individuals have contact with your baby.Make sure your children or those of friends and family are vaccinated and up to date on booster shots.
Encourage anyone who hasn’t had the vaccine or boosters to have them at least two weeks before meeting your baby. Mention that the vaccine does lose strength over time so that it’s better to be safe than sorry.

, You can refuse an unvaccinated individual access to your baby until they are properly vaccinated or your baby has received the first round of pertussis vaccinations. Letting people know you would prefer they stay away until such time can further protect your baby from exposure to whooping cough.Be firm in your decision. Say, “Cam, we’d love for you to meet Emmanuelle, but you don’t believe in vaccinations. Unfortunately, I can’t risk her health to have you and your kids over until she is older and has her vaccines.”

, The best way to protect your baby is having them vaccinated against whooping cough. The vaccine for children under 7 is called DTaP, which stands for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Your baby’s doctor will give them a series of five injections over their first six years of life. Make sure you don’t miss any appointments to boost the vaccine. Doctors recommend the DTaP vaccine at:2 months
4 months
6 months
15-18 months
4-6 years
At age 11 or 12 years, they may be given the TDaP, which has a reduced dose of the diphtheria and pertussis vaccines. The TDaP may also be administered after age 19 if they didn’t get it as a preteen/ teen.

, Make sure that your baby and family members get booster shots regularly. This can ensure that your baby has maximum protection against whooping cough.Get booster shots for your baby after the three initial vaccination injections.
Ensure that others close to your baby also get booster shots., The first signs of whooping cough are similar to those of the common cold. The infection develops from there. Since you cannot ensure whether other people have the vaccine or not, keep your baby away from anyone who is sick.Explain to people that your baby is young and doesn’t have their vaccines, so you need to stay away. For example, “Hey Molly, I know you have a cold, but I’m worried about exposing Cecily to germs. She’s only had one round of vaccines. Maybe we can get together when you’re better?”
If contact with a sick person is absolutely unavoidable, make sure that the sick person covers their mouth while they cough and that they wash their hands frequently. Furthermore, if other family members are sick, everyone in the household should wash their hands frequently, even if they themselves are not sick.

, You or other individuals who come near your baby may live or come in contact with someone else who has whooping cough. If this is the case, make sure you or they take antibiotics to prevent spread of the disease, even if any of you have the whooping cough vaccine.Talk to your doctor if you are worried about your baby getting whooping cough. Your doctor will inform you about the risk and give you tips on preventing the spread of the bacteria that cause whooping cough. They may also prescribe antibiotics for you or another person exposed to it, even if they have received the vaccine.These antibiotics may include: erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin.Remember that babies who haven’t had the first three doses of the vaccine are still susceptible to whooping cough.

, The symptoms of whooping cough resemble a cold during the first 7-10 days after infection. After that, they get more serious and include the high-pitched “whoop” that gives the infection its name. Identifying potential symptoms of whooping cough can help you properly protect your baby from others with the infection. It can also your ensure your baby gets prompt diagnosis and treatment. Common symptoms of whooping cough in babies include:Runny nose
Nasal congestion
Red, watery eyes
Fever
Severe coughing attacks that may also include vomiting and/or a red or blue face
Extreme fatigue
A high-pitched whooping sound when coughing
Difficulty feeding
Dehydration
Bluish tint of the skin caused by low oxygen (cyanosis)
Difficulty breathing or periods where the baby stops breathing entirely (apnea)

Get your baby vaccinated against the flu at six months of age.The earliest age that a baby can receive a flu vaccine is at six months.,
Ask your doctor for your own flu vaccine.In addition to getting your baby vaccinated as soon as he or she is old enough (at six months of age, and every year thereafter), you (and anyone else living in the same house) should also get immunized.,
Do not allow sick guests in the home.While your baby is young (under six months of age), it is important to set a strict rule to not allow any sick guests into the home.,
Try to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months.In an ideal world, every mother would be able to breastfeed their baby exclusively for the first six months of his or her life.,
Keep your baby relatively isolated for the first two months of life.Your baby is especially vulnerable to infections in the first two months of life, before he or she has received any of the standard vaccinations.,
See a doctor when needed.If you do notice your baby developing signs of an infection (such as a fever, a cough, lethargy, a poor appetite, etc.",How to Protect Your Baby from the Flu1," It is highly recommended by doctors to get your baby vaccinated at this time, because catching the flu at a young age can be much more serious than it is for older children and adults.


Prior to the age of six months, when your baby is not vaccinated, it is advisable to take extra precautions to prevent him or her from catching the flu.;
, The purpose of this is that it reduces the chances that someone living in the home will catch the flu. Your baby is in turn at reduced risk if the people around him or her are not sick with the flu.


There is a new flu vaccine available every year that is tailored to the strains of the flu virus that are expected to be most prevalent for that year.
You can receive a flu vaccine annually at your family doctor's office or local pharmacy or health department.

, If a relative or friend wants to visit and see your baby and he or she is ill, explain that you do not want to put your baby at an increased risk of catching the flu. It is okay for guests to visit once your baby's fever has been gone for at least 24 hours (without the use of medications that reduce fever).

, This is because the medical and health benefits of breastfeeding are numerous. Breastfeeding transfers antibodies (which help to fight off any type of infection) from the mother to the baby; without breastfeeding, your baby would not have access to these antibodies at such a young age, as his or her immune system would not yet be sufficiently developed. Therefore, breastfeeding can help to prevent the flu as well as helping to combat any other type of infectious germs your baby may come into contact with.


If you cannot breastfeed exclusively, even breastfeeding part-time is better than not at all.
Another option is to pump breastmilk and to store it for later use, such as when you are at work and unable to breastfeed your baby in person.

, During this time period, keep your baby at home as much as possible in an effort to avoid unnecessarily exposing him or her to germs that could lead to a potentially serious infection.

,), book an appointment with your family doctor. Due to the possibility that an infection could be more serious in a baby, it is important for your baby to be evaluated by a doctor. If it does turn out to be the flu, the doctor will likely offer anti-viral medications (Tamiflu) to help your baby's immune system fight off the infection.


Keep in mind that the flu is more common in the United States during the months of November through March.

Wash your hands regularly.If you have come down with the flu and want to avoid passing it onto your baby, it is key to wash your hands regularly.,
Cover all coughs and sneezes with a tissue.Experts have hypothesized that the primary mode of transmission of the flu virus is via respiratory droplets.,
Clean and disinfect any shared surfaces.If you are sick with the flu, it is important to regularly clean and disinfect any shared surfaces thoroughly.",How to Protect Your Baby from the Flu2," Washing with warm water and soap for 30 seconds is advised, especially before touching your baby or any of your baby's toys or other items. If washing regularly with soap and water is challenging for you, another more convenient option is to use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer - you can carry this with you in your purse during outings and throughout the day.


Also wash your hands before working in the kitchen and preparing your baby's food.

, This means that if your baby (or anyone else) is within 6 feet of you when you cough or sneeze, he or she is at high risk of picking up the infection. This is why it is so important to cover all coughs and sneezes with a tissue.


Using a tissue is preferable to using your hand, as this way your hands do not get contaminated with the infectious droplets.
The flu virus can also be transmitted from touching contaminated objects; however, respiratory droplets are the most common mode of transmission.

, This helps to prevent the transmission of germs not only to your baby (if you are touching any of the same toys or objects), but also to anyone else who may be living in the home (as the less people in the home who become sick the better).


For this reason, be sure to clean doorknobs, countertops, and kitchen appliances, and to change the linens and bathroom towels that you have been using.

Be aware of the heightened risk of flu-related complications.When an older child or adult catches the flu, it is usually not that big of a deal.,
Have your baby treated with Tamiflu (an anti-viral flu medication).If your baby or young child has the flu, it is important to bring him or her to a doctor immediately.,
Watch for complications from the flu.Complications are much more likely to develop from the flu in babies than in adults.",How to Protect Your Baby from the Flu3," Symptoms last for approximately one week, and normally resolve after that without needing any medical help or interventions. For babies and young children, however, it can be a different story.


Approximately 20,000 children under the age of five in the United States are hospitalized for flu-related complications every year.
The younger the child, the greater the risk of flu-related complications.

, This way, he or she can receive anti-viral treatment, which reduces the risk of complications and reduces the length of time your baby will be sick.

, Complications that may arise as a result of the flu virus include:


Pneumonia (an infection that progresses to the lungs)
Severe dehydration
Ear and sinus infections
Worsening of any other health conditions your baby may have
Rarely, the flu can lead to death in babies, which is why prompt medical attention and appropriate treatment is key.

Get vaccinated.,
Ask your doctor whether your infant can be vaccinated.,
Breastfeed your baby, if possible.,
Provide your baby with proper nutrition.,
Carry hand sanitizer everywhere.,
Limit your infant’s contact with people during flu season.,
Keep sick people away from your infant.,
Use a sling or baby carrier in public places.,
Inform your pediatrician if someone in your home has the flu.,
Use antiviral medication.,
Sterilize your baby’s bottles.,
Wash your hands frequently.,
Cover your mouth and nose if you cough or sneeze.",How to Protect Your Infant from Flu," As soon as the seasonal flu vaccine is made available, you should visit your doctor and get vaccinated. By being vaccinated, you’ll protect yourself from being infected. As a result, your chance of infecting your infant will be much lower. Without a flu vaccine, you and your family will be much more vulnerable.Everyone who lives in your home should be vaccinated.
Anyone who encounters your infant, such as extended family, should be vaccinated.;
, Typically, infants 6 months or older can get a flu vaccine. Getting the flu vaccine may dramatically lower their risk of catching the flu. However, infants younger than 6 months cannot get a vaccine.

Talk to your doctor about whether a vaccine is appropriate for your child., Breastfeeding helps transfer a mother’s immunities to her baby. As a result, breastfeeding can potentially bolster your infant’s immune system so they can better resist or fight off the flu.If you can’t breastfeed, talk to your child’s pediatrician about steps you can take to build your child’s immunity to things like the flu virus.

, While you should always provide your baby with proper nutrition, it is even more important during flu season. Good nutrition will bolster your infant’s immune system. In the end, they’ll be able to resist or fight off the flu a lot more effectively., Hand sanitizer is one of the most effective weapons in killing germs before they cause sickness. As a result, you should carry and use alcohol-based hand sanitizer everywhere you go during flu season. This is important, as flu germs could live for hours on inanimate objects. By sanitizing your hands and objects you use often – like your phone or car keys – you’ll help protect your baby from the flu., As a rule, most babies should stay out of the public for their first two months of life. This should be extended when it comes to flu season. During flu season, the more your baby is at home, the lower their chance of catching the flu.

Stay away from places with lots of people like the mall, grocery stores, or entertainment venues.Keep your child home from daycare if a lot of children in your area have the flu.
Only take your child into public if necessary.

, Regardless of who it is, you should forbid sick from coming into contact with your infant. By establishing a “no sick” policy, you’ll help protect your infant from catching the flu. Ultimately, while you might alienate a few people, you’ll safeguard your baby’s health.Stay 6 feet (1.8 m) away from people who are sick or displaying flu symptoms

, By using a sling or confining your baby to a carrier, you’ll shield and protect them from germs and from people who may try to touch them. This is important, as many people like to touch the hands, face, and feet of infants. If your baby confined, they won’t be able to get close enough to do so., The second you know that someone in your home has the flu, you should contact your pediatrician and let them know. Your pediatrician will be able to give you great information about how you can limit the chance of your little one catching the flu from someone at home., If you catch the flu, you should ask your doctor immediately about prescribing you antiviral medication. Antiviral medication can decrease the severity and longevity of the flu virus. The less time you’re sick, the lower the chance your infant may catch the flu from you.Antivirals work best if taken within 2 days of getting sick.
Anyone in your home who catches the flu should ask their doctor about using antiviral medication.

, While sterilizing your baby’s bottles is a good policy normally, it’s extremely important during flu season. This especially important if you travel outside the home with your infant, as flu germs could live on objects for several hours at a time. By sterilizing your baby’s bottles, you’ll limit the chance of them catching the flu., Whether you are or aren’t sick, you should take extra care to wash your hands during flu season. When washing your hands, use warm water and soap. Washing your hands will help protect you from getting sick and from bringing flu germs into contact with your infant., Whether you have the flu or not, you should make it a habit to cover yourself when you cough or sneeze. The best way to do this is with a clean tissue. Afterwards, you should discard the tissue and wash your hands."

Purchase a mild shampoo safe for your baby.,
Wash your baby’s hair once every two or three days.,
Keep your baby's head dry.,
Rub your baby's head every day.,
Work on the scales.,
Use mineral oil or petroleum jelly.,
Work in a warm room with warm water.,
Make sure you're ready.,
Stay with your baby at all times.,
Place your baby down.,
Wash your baby.,
Make sure your baby's scalp is clean.,
Dry off your baby.",How to Prevent Cradle Cap," Using a mild baby shampoo is always best for your baby, unless your doctor recommends something different. Pick one that is labeled for babies and says ""mild"" or ""gentle"" on it., Cradle cap is not directly caused by allergies or not bathing your child properly. However, washing your baby's hair every few days can help prevent your child from developing it.Up until your baby's umbilical cord falls off, consider just giving him or her sponge baths rather than full baths.
Once the umbilical cord falls off at two to three weeks, you can give your baby a full bath., Some suspect that sweating can lead to cradle cap. Therefore, if it's not cold out, try to keep warm hats off your baby. If you notice your baby is sweating, take her or his cap off and gently wipe off any sweat., Once a day, massage your baby's head gently with your fingers. You can also use a soft-bristled baby brush to achieve the same effect. The idea is the increase in circulation can decrease the chances of your baby getting cradle cap., Once your baby gets cradle cap, one way to help prevent it in the future is to work on the scales. That is, when your rubbing your baby's head or washing it, try to gently work the scales loose.Do not try to peel scales off with a fingernail. Just try to gently loosen any ones that are already coming off by rubbing them with your fingers in or out of the bath or gently use a soft brush on the scales. You can also use a warm wet washcloth.
Once your baby gets cradle cap, your doctor may recommend some more aggressive treatments, such a hydrocortisone cream or an anti-fungal shampoo typically used for adult dandruff., Another way to help loosen scales is to use mineral oil or petroleum jelly. Simply rub a bit on the baby's head and let it soak in as long as it needs to. This may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. After that, brush and wash your baby's hair., The room shouldn't be cold enough that it gives your baby shivers. Also, the water should be comfortably warm, but not too warm. Test it on the inside of your arm to make sure it's comfortable., You should have all the supplies you need at hand. In fact, make sure they are within reach so you don't have to step away from your baby. Plus, you should take off any jewellery you don't want to get wet or that could scratch your baby.For a sponge bath, you'll need a flat surface in a warm area, along with something for your baby to lay on, such as clean towel or blanket. You'll also need a basin or sink to hold the warm water, along with all the supplies you'll need for a regular bath, minus the bathtub.
For a regular bath, you'll need a place where you can bathe your baby, such as a baby bathtub or even a sink with a washcloth in the bottom. You'll also need a washcloth, mild soap, mild baby shampoo, and a towel.
Don't forget the clean diaper and clean clothes., It is never safe to leave a baby alone in a bathtub or on a flat surface like a counter. Make sure you are always right there, and if you are giving a bath to a baby on a counter, make sure you keep a hand on your baby at all times.It only takes an inch of water to drown a baby, and it can happen in under a minute.
If you're giving a sponge bath, the baby could easily roll off the counter, injuring him- or herself.

, If you're doing a sponge bath, place your baby on his or her back on the flat surface.If you're using a tub, undress your baby, then gently lay your baby down in the water on his or her back, putting your baby in feet first.Make sure you keep your baby warm by pouring water over him or her throughout bath time, if your baby is in a bathtub.
For a sponge bath, you don't need to completely undress the baby because you'll only show what needs washing at the moment.

, Start with the face, rinsing it with clean water only. Move on to the scalp. Use a little baby shampoo in your washcloth or hand, and gently rub it into the scalp. Use water to rinse it out, or ring out the washcloth with clean water. Rub it over the scalp to clean off the shampoo.Use a mild soap to wash the rest of your baby's body. For a boy, gently wash all around the penis without lifting the flap of skin. For a girl, wash from front to back without parting the vaginal lips.Rinse off any soap with a clean washcloth and water.

, At the end of the bath, make sure you've washed all the soap off the scalp by running your hand over your baby's head. Leaving soap on can cause dryness, which in turn may contribute to cradle cap., At the end, use a towel to gently pat your baby dry. Make sure the scalp is dry. You can apply a baby lotion if his or her skin appears dry. Put your baby in a fresh diaper and fresh clothes.As you lift your baby out, be sure to have one hand supporting his or her neck and the other under his or her bottom, as you wrap your fingers around the baby's thigh so you don't lose your grip.

Understand the one-minute test.,
Learn about the five-minute test.,
Watch for it to be given a third time.",How to Read an APGAR Score," Even though APGAR refers to the designer's name, it can also be used as an acronym: ""APGAR"" can stand for appearance (skin color), pulse, grimace response (reflexes), activity (muscle tone), and respiration. This test is used to measure the overall well-being of the baby by looking at the major indicators of wellness., The first category is appearance. In this part of the test, the medical staff will look at the baby's skin color. The skin color can indicate whether the baby is receiving enough oxygen or not.A zero in this category means the baby is blue all over.
A one means the baby is mostly a healthy color but may be bluish at the hands and feet.
A two means the baby is a healthy color all over, including pink at the hands and feet.

, The next category on the APGAR test is heart rate. A nurse, doctor, or midwife will check for the baby's heartbeat. The medical staff will also determine the pulse rate to see how the baby is thriving.If the baby doesn't have a heart rate, the score is zero.
A score of one indicates a heart rate under 100 beats per minute, which is not quite as fast as it should be.
A score of two indicates the baby's heart rate is over 100, which means the baby is thriving in this particular category.

, The grimace response is how the baby reacts to mild stimulus. For instance, the baby may be lightly pinched to see if the baby responds a lot or if it doesn't respond at all to the stimulus.A zero indicates no response.
A one means the baby pulls a face (grimaces) but doesn't sneeze or cough.
A two means the baby pulls a face and either cries, pulls away, sneezes, or coughs in response.

, Next comes a check of muscle tone. Muscle tone just measures the baby's activity to see if it is moving around on its own. An active baby indicates that they are doing well.A zero indicates the baby is limp or not moving much at all.
If the baby is given a one, it means they are moving with smaller or less active motions, but they are not as vigorous as the doctor would prefer.
A two means the baby is actively moving around.

, The last category on the APGAR test is breathing. A person on the medical staff examines the baby to see how they're breathing, then assigns a number to the breathing effort from zero to two based on what they observe.A zero means the baby is not breathing, while a one means the baby has irregular breathing.
A two means is the baby is breathing just fine, which usually means the baby is both breathing and crying with normal effort and at a normal rate.

, The score from the APGAR is generally taken as a whole rather than in individual categories. In other words, all the scores from each category are added together to get one number. The best possible score is ten, which means the baby is doing as well as they can be. However, most babies don't score a ten at birth.A score from seven to ten means the baby will just need standard care.
If the score is under seven, the baby will need more monitoring and possibly interventions, such as help breathing., While a low score may seem scary, it usually doesn't mean the baby will have long-term health effect. Rather, it just means the baby needs a little extra care right after birth to help stabilize their health.Certain factors can cause the APGAR score to be lower. Often, it's caused by a C-section, premature birth, or a birth that's a bit more difficult than other births. A low score can also be caused by fluid in the airway.

, If the baby has a low score, generally one of two things will happen. With the first intervention, the baby's airway will be cleared out if it has fluid, and the baby will be given oxygen. A second option is the baby may be given stimulation to get the heart beating more rapidly.Keep in mind that if these basic interventions do not work, the medical team will do whatever is necessary to improve the baby's condition. This can vary based on the causes of the score.

, Generally, the baby will be placed somewhere warm while the test is performed. That can either be on a parent's belly or under a warmer. Keeping the baby warm is important., As the name implies, the one-minute test is performed a minute after the baby leaves the mother's body. It tells the medical staff how well the baby did during the birthing process and accesses the baby's need for assistance., The five-minute test, as it sounds, is given five minutes after birth. This test is the same as the one-minute test, but it's given to measure how the baby is doing out in the world (out of the womb).This test also helps evaluate whether any interventions are working., While the test is usually just performed twice, it may be given a third time if the baby has a low score. Usually, it's given at the ten minute mark to see if the baby has improved any from the five-minute test."

Understand what causes hair tourniquet syndrome.Hair tourniquet syndrome is most common in the first four months of your baby's life.,
Be aware of the most frequent locations for hair tourniquet syndrome.Hair tourniquet syndrome is when a piece of hair gets wrapped around an extremity or body part in a way that progressively cuts off the circulation to that area.,
Keep your baby's environment clean.,
Look out for any changes to your baby's circulation.Because a hair tourniquet can compromise the circulation in the affected extremity (or body part), you may notice that area becoming discolored.,
Take note if your child is particularly irritable or inconsolable.The ""classic presentation"" of hair tourniquet syndrome is an inconsolable infant; however, irritability and inconsolability could be due to a variety of other conditions, such as an infection or an injury, so it does not necessarily correlate to hair tourniquet syndrome.

,
Examine for local swelling with a clear boundary.Another thing to look for if you are worried about hair tourniquet syndrome is swelling at the end of an extremity (or body part) with a ""clear circumferential demarcation"" (a clear border of where the swelling ends, which would equate to where the hair tourniquet is located).,
Remove hair tourniquets in the early stages at home.It is key to understand that the best way to prevent hair tourniquet syndrome is to remove any possible hair tourniquets the moment you notice them.,
Do frequent checks of your baby's body.If you want to prevent hair tourniquet syndrome, your best bet is to frequently examine the parts of your baby's body that are most prone to developing hair tourniquets.,
Cut or unwrap any hair tourniquets that you find.If you do find a hair that has become wrapped around one of your baby's body parts, check to see if it is loose enough for you to cut off with scissors.,
See a doctor immediately if you cannot get the hair tourniquet off yourself.Because a hair tourniquet that gets wrapped too tightly and develops into a full-blown syndrome can be very dangerous, you need to take your baby to the Emergency Department immediately.,
Ask about anesthesia.Because hair tourniquet syndrome can cause your baby to feel a lot of pain, the doctor treating it will most likely administer some sort of anesthesia prior to removing the hair tourniquet.,
Have the doctor remove the hair tourniquet.The doctor can use special instruments such as forceps to get a better grip on the hair, allowing her to remove hairs that you may have had trouble getting off at home.",How to Prevent Hair Tourniquet Syndrome in Babies," This is because it is during this timeframe that women may inadvertently lose more hair following pregnancy. This is related to the changes the body is undergoing as it returns to its normal state following pregnancy.


A baby can get hair tourniquet syndrome from repetitive motion in a confined space where there is hair present.
For example, a baby may get a hair tourniquet on a finger after having his hands in mittens.
A baby may get a hair tourniquet on a toe after having his feet in confined pyjamas that cover not only the legs but also the feet.;
,


The most common locations for hair tourniquet syndrome are the penis in boys (accounting for 44% of cases), and the toes (accounting for 40% of cases).
The fingers account for 8.7% of cases, and 6.8% of cases are at other sites — these include the wrist, the scrotum, the tongue, the vaginal labium, the ear lobe, the umbilicus, or the nipple.

, One of the key preventative strategies for hair tourniquet syndrome is to ensure that your baby is playing and sleeping in a clean environment. Regular cleaning (at least two times per week) minimizes the chances that hairs are present, thus diminishing the chance that a hair tourniquet will form.

, It may become more pale, or a purplish blue color. If you notice discoloration in any of your child's extremities, go to the Emergency Room immediately. If the hair tourniquet is tight enough to have compromised circulation, immediate medical care must be received in order to keep the compromised extremity alive.

,, If you notice this, it is highly suspicious for hair tourniquet syndrome.

, You want to remove them before they have the chance to tighten to the degree that they cause a full-blown syndrome, cutting off your baby's circulation and compromising the health of that body part.

, This includes the penis in boys, and the toes and fingers in both boys and girls. If you check these areas every day for any concerning signs or symptoms, and you notice no abnormalities, your baby is probably okay.

, If so, cut it off immediately and you will prevent it from developing into full-blown hair tourniquet syndrome.


If is already too tight to cut off (because the scissors cannot fit underneath it), see if there is a loose end.
If you can find a loose end to the hair, you can try unwrapping it. This is a slower method than cutting; however, it is oftentimes quite successful.
If you cannot find a loose end, see if there is a knot anywhere in the hair. If there is, you can break the hair at the knot and use that as the loose end from which to unwrap.

, Otherwise, you risk your baby losing circulation to that body part, and suffering irreversible damage possibly requiring amputation.

, The type of anesthesia given will depend upon the location, severity, and which body part is affected. If it is an extremity such as a finger or toe, local anesthesia (either topically or by injection) will most likely be sufficient. In other cases, general anesthesia may be needed to ease the pain prior to removal.

, Note that, if it was the penis that was affected, your baby will need to see a urologist (a specialist in the male urinary system) following the hair removal to ensure that there are no further problems or damage to that area.


Instead of using forceps and sharp tools, your doctor may use a hair removal cream (a depilatory such as Nair) to remove the hair tourniquet.
In the most severe cases, where circulation has been compromised and the extremity is no longer viable (it has ""died""), amputation may be needed.

Fold one side of the shirt over.,
Fold the other side of the shirt over.,
Fold the top of the shirt down.,
Fold the bottom of the shirt in half.,
Wrap the diaper around your baby.",How to Make a Homemade Diaper1," Cotton is more absorbent than most synthetic fibers, so it makes a better material to use for a cloth diaper.


Use a short sleeve or three-quarter-length sleeve for best results. A three-quarter length sleeve may make it easier to pin the diaper on larger babies and toddlers, but may be more material than you need for smaller babies.
Choose a size based on the size of your child. An older baby or toddler may need a large or extra large shirt, but a newborn would likely only need a small.;
, You can do this on the floor or on any other large working surface. Lay it so the sleeves are at the top.

, The bottom of the shirt should be folded over about 1/3 of the way, and the seam where the sleeve meets the body of the shirt should be just below the center of the neckline. Keep the sleeve of the shirt pointed outward.

, This side should be identical to the fold made on the first side, so that the shirt is folded into thirds. Keep the sleeve pointed outwards. At this point, you should be left with a ""t"" or cross shape.

, Bring the part of the t-shirt extending above the sleeves down over the sleeves. The upper part of the lowercase ""t"" shape should be folded all the way over, creating a capital ""T"" shape.

, Take the bottom portion of the shirt and draw it up to the bottom sleeve line. Essentially, you are making a fold that shortens the length of the shirt by half. You will still have a capital ""T"" shape, but it will be a shorter ""T.""

, Sit the baby on the part of the shirt that starts just below the sleeves. Bring the bottom portion of the diaper up and over the front of your baby, and wrap the sleeves around the back and to the front. Pin the sleeves to the front using a diaper pin."

Fold the square part of the blanket.,
Use the diaper.",How to Make a Homemade Diaper2," Receiving blankets are cheap, and cotton is fairly absorbent. You can also use other rectangles of fabric made from terry cloth, flannel, or other absorbent materials.


Make sure you use a square receiving blanket.
If you're using another fabric other than a receiving blanket, cut it into a square that's 34"" to 36"" on each side.

, Use the floor or another large surface. Smooth out any wrinkles in the blanket.

, Take the two right hand corners of the blanket and bring them to the two left-hand corners so that the blanket is folded in half.

, This time, take the two top corners and bring them to the two bottom corners to fold the blanket in half again. You should now have a square shape again.


Smooth out any wrinkles in the blanket after folding it.

, Take the top layer of the bottom left corner and pull it towards the right. The corner should lie to the right of the rest of the blanket, and this should form a triangle shape. The blanket should now look like a wide triangle with a square layer underneath the left side.

, Grab hold of the bottom right and the top corner of the triangle shape and flip the entire blanket over so that the triangle points down instead of up. Flatten it smooth again.

, Grab the two edges of on the left of the blanket that make up the square shape. Fold this into a rectangle that lies in the middle of the triangle by folding it over two or three times. This is your diaper shape.

, You use the diaper by laying your baby so that the wide edge of the triangle is lined up with their waist. Fold the bottom of the diaper up the baby's front side. Fold both sides of the triangle in to meet the front of the diaper and pin them all together over the baby's waist."

Use the diaper.",How to Make a Homemade Diaper3," The patterns for this homemade diaper can be found here: http://www.adventuresinfluff.com/2011/08/how-to-sew-your-own-recycled-t-shirt.html. You can either print out the scaled pattern or the measurements pattern. Use scissors to cut the pattern out.


The measurement pattern is just a reference for you to be able to draw your own pattern based on the size you want. Each line is labeled and each label has a corresponding length for each size. For example, if you want a diaper for a newborn, you'd draw the shape shown with the ""C"" line being 2.5"".
The scaled pattern should be printed out on standard printer paper. You need to do so with a printer that prints in color. Then you cut out the pattern of the desired size. For example, for a small diaper, you'd cut along the green lines. Then you line up pattern A and pattern B using the black dots as guides. Then you mirror the patterns across the appropriate dashed line for the size you're using. Then you tape the pattern together.

, Lay your t-shirt out. Make the t-shirt inside out. Then lay it on a flat surface so that the sleeves are at the top. Lay the pattern on the middle of the t-shirt. Hold it in place with pins or weights. Use a marker or sharpie to trace around the pattern.


Smooth out the t-shirt so it's free of wrinkles. Iron it first if necessary.

, Remove the pattern. Then pin the t-shirt all the way around the marked cutting lines, on the inside of the lines. Make sure you pin both layers of the shirt together.

, Use scissors to cut through both layers of the t-shirt, and cut out the shape.

, Use an old towel and cut out a rectangle to be used as a soaker for the diaper. Cut it out using the following size guide:


Newborns: 8"" by 12"".
Small: 9"" by 14.5"".
Medium: 9"" by 16.5"".
Large: 10"" by 19"".

, First, fold the soaker in half by the short side so that the long side is still the same length and the short side is half the length. Then lay the soaker on the diaper shape so that it runs through the center with the wings on either side. Pin it at the top and bottom.

, Sew all the way around the diaper shape except for the bottom where the soaker is. The soaker should be sewn to the diaper shape at the top where the wings are but not at the bottom.


Make the stitch line about 1/4"" from the edge.

, Pull the entire inside of the diaper out through the hole where the bottom of the soaker is. Straighten the whole thing out so that it looks how it did before being turned inside out. Straighten out the soaker so that it runs down the middle of the diaper again.

, Pin the soaker in place at the bottom of the diaper. Sew along the bottom of the diaper so the opening is closed.

, Sew along each side of the middle of the diaper so that the soaker stays in place on the inside of the diaper. The stitch lines should run vertically up and down the diaper and should be near the wings.

, Fold the long edges in toward each other so that only the wings stick out. Sit your baby in the center of the diaper. Fold the bottom of the diaper up the front of the baby. Pull the wings around the waist of the baby and pin it all together in the front."

Lean close to the baby.,
Reach toward your baby.,
Put your hands under the baby.,
Pull the baby to your chest.",How to Pick Up a Baby1," Before reaching out to pick up your baby, get close by and lean over him. You don’t want to have to reach out too far to pick up a baby. Bend your knees slightly as you bend over so that you are lifting properly.Make sure you remove any obstacles in the way. If the baby is in a crib, take down the side rather than lift over the top. This will prevent extra strain to your arms and back as you lift over or around something.;
, While this seems obvious, it is important to do it where your baby can see you. Babies as young as two months learn to recognize someone’s arms coming to pick them up, and can adjust their body to make them easier to pick up. This includes extending and stiffening their legs, and widening or raising their arms. It may take a little bit of conditioning, but this can be a good way to make the baby a little easier to get a hold of., You want to get your hands underneath the baby so you can lift him up. Place one hand under the baby’s head, and the other under his bottom. Make sure the fingers on your hand under the head are spread wide to support the neck. You want your hands here because that will give best support to your baby’s head, neck, and back.When you put your hands under the baby’s head, you’ll feel some softer spots. These spots, called fontanels, will feel soft and easy to break, but they are quite strong. Don’t worry about touching them.For the first few months of his life, the baby will need your hands to help support his head because his neck isn’t strong enough. After about six months, the baby should be able to hold his head steady without assistance, and even be able to flex it forward while sitting., Once your hands are in place, and you have a firm grip on the baby, pull him into your chest for the best support. While you can hold a baby out in front of you with your arms extended, it is best to carry him close to your chest for better support.This is as much for you as the baby. Babies can be heavy, especially as they get older, and holding the baby closer to your chest will give you better support. This avoids too much pressure on your arms or back.

"
"
Get close to the other person.,
Put your hands in the right places.,
Tell the other person you are ready.,
Pull the baby close to your chest.",How to Pick Up a Baby2," The less distance the better, as you don’t want too much space while you both are reaching out. This will make the passing quicker, and help provide support to the baby during the transition.Make sure you mirror the other person’s position. Stand if she is standing, or sit if she is sitting.

, Make sure your hands are in the right place to support the baby once she is passed to you. Place one hand under her head, with fingers spread under the neck, and the other hand under her rear. You want to make sure you are able to give support to your baby’s head, neck, and spine., Once your hands are in position, and you are ready to receive the baby, let the other person know. You want the other person to know that you are taking the baby so she can release her. You don’t want to get in an awkward tug-of-war here.Be clear when you communicate this. Say “I’ve got her” or “I’m ready now” so the other person knows that you are ready.
Do not tell the other person you are ready if you aren’t. The baby will get passed to you, so there is no need to rush if you aren’t prepared.

, Once you have a firm hold on the baby, and the other person is ready to let go, pull the baby to your chest. This will allow you to secure your grip on her, and set you up for however you would like to hold her."

Pick the baby up out of a chair.,
Lift out of a car seat.,
Be careful if you have a bad back.,
Comfort a crying baby.",How to Pick Up a Baby3," Since it will probably be harder to get your hands under everything from a chair, you can start by putting your hands underneath his arms. If the baby is under four months, make sure to support the head as soon as possible. Make sure to keep your wrists as straight as possible to help your wrists.When picking the baby up out of a high chair, make sure to remove the tray first. This will let you get closer to the baby for better support, and make sure the baby doesn’t get caught in the chair as you lift.The baby shouldn’t be in a high chair until he can sit up on his own, which should come at about 4 to 6 months.

, When you’re taking a baby out of a car set, make sure you are firmly set in the car. Get into the car, and avoid twisting your body. If that means climbing into the car to make sure your weight is in there, the do that. You don’t want to be twisting your back or extending your arms as you lift the baby.Remember that the safest place for a car seat is in the middle of the backseat, it will be quite a reach for you without getting in the car first. That of course means a lot of weight on your arms and upper back if you aren’t careful.While it may be easier to tote the car seat around with the baby already in it, you should leave the seat in the car once the baby reaches 15 pounds. At that weight, and beyond, the baby and the seat will be too heavy to carry without creating too much extra strain., Even if they aren’t heavy, picking up babies can put stress on your back, especially if you lift improperly. Whenever you pick up a baby, kneel down, bring the baby close to you, then stand up with your legs. Tighten your stomach muscles when you lift to keep the strain in your core, not your back.Another place you can protect yourself from back pain is to sit carefully when feeding a baby. Pull a chair up close to the baby and sit in it while feeding in a high chair. This will put you on the baby’s level, and prevent you from bending over while doing it.
You can take other steps when carrying to reduce back pain. Don’t carry the child on your hip, and if you are walking, consider using a “front pack,” which will keep the baby in front of you.

, Newborns cry because they don’t have any other way to communicate, and for the first few months can cry for around 3 hours a day (and sometimes longer!). It is okay, even natural, to pick up a crying baby. If you are picking up a crying newborn, help soothe the baby by gently swaying or making shushing sounds.When you pick up the crying baby, try to figure out what is causing his discomfort. Once you determine whether he needs to be fed, is gassy, has a dirty diaper, or is hurting, you can make sure the baby gets what he needs.
However, some babies, especially really young ones, might cry for no reason. So, if you check out those things and everything still seems okay, then just do your best to soothe the baby.
The regular crying can be frustrating, but it is important to keep your cool during these times. While you may want to get the baby to calm down quickly, it can be okay to let the baby fuss for 5 minutes while you figure out what might be wrong or allow the baby to calm down.

Choose a base oil.,
Select additional optional ingredients.,
Measure out the ingredients.,
Heat the ingredients in a double boiler.,
Remove the mixture from the heat.,
Strain the oil to remove the herbs.,
Store the oil in a cool, dry place.",How to Make Baby Oil1," This can be olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil, or any other oil that you prefer. These oils all have different textures and scents, so be sure to smell and feel them before you begin working so that you don’t end up with a finished product you don’t like.Coconut oil is solid at room temperature, so keep this in mind when choosing it as your base oil. You will likely need to find a container with a wide mouth. That way you can scoop the finished oil out with a spoon or your fingers.;
, Add dried herbs like calendula, chamomile, or lavender to give your baby oil additional anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing properties. You can buy them at most health food stores and organic shopping centers, or grow them yourself in containers to have on hand for future recipes.Choose a fragrance oil or essential oil if you want your baby oil to have a particular scent, like lavender, orange, or rose.

, Use 1 cup (about .25 liters) of your base oil and 2 tablespoons of any chosen herbs.Adjust the amount of herbs accordingly if you want a stronger or more subtle scent. If you’re adding any additional fragrance or essential oils, only use a few drops. Too much of these oils can irritate skin.

, Herbs can burn quickly, so don’t heat the concoction in a pan directly on the burner. If you don’t have a double boiler, you can make one by filling a saucepan with an inch or so of water and bringing the water to a boil. Place another saucepan on top of that one and fill the top pan with your ingredients.


Heat the ingredients for about an hour, or until the oil begins to take on the color and the scent of the herbs., Allow the pan to cool to room temperature before you attempt to handle the oil.

, Take a mesh colander or a piece of cheesecloth and sift the contents through that into a mason jar or glass bottle.


If you chose to work with coconut oil, the oil will need to be warmed slightly so that it’s liquid again while you strain it. Try not to touch the warm oil as you strain it to avoid getting burned.

, A dark spot like a cabinet or closet shelf is best, and be sure the jar or bottle you’ve selected has a tight-fitting lid. The oil will have a shelf life of 6-9 months."

Strain out the herbs.",How to Make Baby Oil2," Coconut oil is not recommended for this method, since there won’t be any heat applied to melt it and combine it with the herbs. Otherwise, you can use any other base oil that is in liquid form at room temperature, like almond, olive, or apricot oil.


Choose any dried herbs or fragrance oils that you’d like to infuse into the oil.

, Mason jars are best since the lid gives you a tight seal, but any glass bottle or jar with a lid is fine. Measure 2-4 tablespoons of herbs into your container and then pour one cup (about .25 liters) of your base oil over the herbs. If you’re adding fragrance or essential oil, put in a few drops and then seal the jar., A porch or deck is the perfect spot if you have one. Otherwise, use a windowsill that gets lots of sun., Once the herbs have been infusing the oil for a few weeks, it's time to remove them. Strain them out using a mesh colander or piece of cheesecloth as you pour the oil into another jar or bottle.Put a lid on your jar of baby oil and store it in a cool, dry place for up to 6-9 months.

Attend all scheduled prenatal care visits.,
Ask about delivery options.,
Prepare for the possibility of a preterm birth.,
Ask your doctor how to take care of your own health during your pregnancy.,
Get help finding a good pediatrician.",How to Prepare for a Multiple Birth1," There is a higher risk of complications during pregnancy and delivery when you are carrying multiples. Seeing your prenatal care provider regularly can help put your mind at ease and catch any potential complications early.Ask your primary care doctor or OB-GYN to refer you to a doctor who has experience dealing with multiple pregnancies and multiple births.
You may need to have more frequent prenatal visits for a multiple pregnancy than you would during a pregnancy with a single fetus.;
, Birthing multiples requires additional monitoring equipment, a potentially longer labor, and extra precautions for your safety and that of the babies. Ask your doctor about the advantages and disadvantages of a surgical delivery (cesarean section) vs. a vaginal birth in the case of a multiple pregnancy.The fact that you are carrying multiples does not necessarily mean that you will need a cesarean section. The decision to have a cesarean section vs. natural birth will be based in part on your past birthing history, the positions of the fetuses inside your womb, and whether there are any complications with the pregnancy (such as a low-lying placenta).

, This is the most common complication with multiple births. If you are carrying twins, there is a greater than 50% chance that they will be born preterm, and higher numbers of multiples are almost always born preterm. Ask your doctor about what sorts of special care your babies will need if they are born preterm., In addition to potential complications for your babies, carrying multiples can place additional stress on the pregnant mother. Talk to your doctor if you have any specific concerns about your own health. You may wish to discuss some of the following issues:Proper nutrition. Women carrying multiples are advised to gain more weight than women carrying a single baby. As a general rule of thumb, you should eat an extra 300 calories for each fetus on top of what you would normally consume.
Exercise. Staying active is important during any pregnancy, but you may need to avoid anything too strenuous. Ask your doctor about an appropriate level of exercise for your pregnancy.
Risk of pre-eclampsia and other health complications. Talk to your doctor about the possible health risks to you. Multiple pregnancies come with an increased risk of developing problems like pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes.

, Your prenatal health specialist may be able to connect you with a pediatrician who is able to see multiple new patients and who has experience with the health issues young multiples may experience.

Take a multiple birth class.,
Consider hiring a doula or birth attendant.,
Join a support group for parents of multiple births.,
Talk to a lactation specialist about breastfeeding multiples.",How to Prepare for a Multiple Birth2," Many hospitals and birth centers offer classes specifically for parents expecting multiples. These classes may offer information about what to expect during a multiple pregnancy and birth, advice on maintaining good maternal health during the pregnancy and after delivery, and practical information about preparing for life at home with multiple babies. They can also help you build your support network by introducing you to other parents who are also expecting multiples., A multiple birth can be mentally and physically exhausting. Doulas can help provide advice or instructions to ease anxiety and discomfort during a multiples pregnancy and birth.Doulas and birth attendants work hard to guide you through the pregnancy and help you understand what to expect. Doulas can offer excellent support and encouragement during delivery, and can help advocate for you while also providing comfort and advice during labor.
Some doulas also offer assistance with light housekeeping and early childcare so you can rest or get other things accomplished.

, Many regions have local activity clubs and support groups for families with multiples. These groups can give excellent advice on local childcare and deals on items for multiples, and may even provide clothing exchanges, furniture or car seat hand-me-downs, and suggestions for parenting multiples., If you’re interested in breastfeeding your babies, you may wish to seek out support and advice before they are born. Breastfeeding multiples is possible, but it presents challenges beyond those involved in breastfeeding a single baby. Many hospitals and birth centers have lactation specialists on staff who can help you deal with these unique challenges."

Babyproof the house ahead of time.,
Buy and assemble the supplies you will need.,
Line up infant childcare assistance.",How to Prepare for a Multiple Birth3," Once your multiples are born, you will probably be too busy caring for them to spend time baby-proofing your home. Try to get at least the basics done ahead of time:Cover electrical outlets
Install baby-proof cabinet locks
Pad hard corners or edges of furniture
Install baby gates at the bottoms and tops of staircases
Strap down heavy furniture, like TVs, bookcases, and dressers

, Buying and assembling the necessary products in advance will save you the stress and time of preparing the nursery once the babies arrive. Keep in mind that you need to purchase supplies and furniture that can accommodate multiple babies.


Very young multiple babies can sleep together in the same crib. Depending on how many babies you are expecting, you may not need to purchase more than one crib.Keep in mind that your multiples will likely be born pre-term, and therefore smaller than your average singleton newborn. Consider buying clothes, diapers, and swaddling cloths designed for pre-term babies.

, Many new mothers of multiples need help caring for the babies during the first few months. If you are able, start interviewing nannies, babysitters, family members, or neighbors before the babies are born so that you have a go-to helper when the time comes.


Consider hiring assistance even for just a few hours each day in the first several weeks after delivery. This will give you time to rest and recover or get things done around the house.

Close your Diaper Genie.",How to Empty a Diaper Genie," Make sure your Diaper Genie rests squarely on the floor. Push the button on the front of your Genie to separate the top portion of the Genie from the bottom portion (you can let the top portion rest on the ground. You won’t need it for a while.)If there are any diapers remaining in the top portion of the Genie, push them down into the bottom portion of the Genie.
Take care to go slowly when opening your Genie. You don’t want to make a mess!;
, The diapers should at this point be consolidated in the bottom half of the Diaper Genie and contained in a bag. Grip the bag a few inches above where the diapers are stored and give the bag a little shake; this will further consolidate the diapers. In the middle of your Diaper Genie you’ll find the cutter. Use this to cut the bag into two halves.Try to cut the bag approximately six inches above where the diapers are stashed.
The cutter is located in the center of the top portion of the Genie. You should be able to easily spot it, as long as your Diaper Genie is open.

, Lift the full bag out of the Genie and give it one more shake to consolidate the diapers. Close the bag by tying a double knot. The dirty diapers are now ready to be disposed of in any available garbage.Make sure to tie your knot extra tight. Otherwise, you run the risk of leaks and bad smells.
Keep your foot on the petal to prevent your Diaper Genie from tipping over., Take the bag that is still attached to your Diaper Genie. Tie a knot at the bottom. Pull on the bag to create some slack in the top portion of your Diaper Genie and tuck the bag into the bottom portion of your Diaper Genie. Shut the lid of your Diaper Genie.You’ll know the Genie has closed successfully when you hear the top snap shut.
You should pull out about 18 inches of bag to prepare for the next use., You’ll know your Diaper Genie is ready for a bag refill because the refill film will say “almost empty” and “needs replacing.” Diaper Genie refill cartridges are available for purchase online and in stores.A three-pack of Diaper Genie cartridges goes for around $15 on Amazon.
Each pack consists of 270 bags per cartridge.

, Hold the Diaper Genie cartridge in one hand and use the other to rip off the plastic seal at the top. Pull the bag out of the top of the cartridge and then pull it through the center of the cartridge. Tie a tight knot at the bottom of the bag.You'll need to pull about 18 inches of bag to prepare for the next use.
If you don't remember to pull out enough bag for next use, don't worry. Just be cognizant that you'll be able to fit fewer diapers in your bag than you're used to.

, Open the lid of your Diaper Genie and remove the old cartridge. Replace it with the new cartridge and thread the bag through the clamp so the knot hangs at the bottom of the Diaper Genie. Put the lid back on your Diaper Genie; you’ll know the lid has been properly secured when you hear a snap.The clamp is located in the middle of the top portion of the Diaper Genie and is used to secure the bag in place.
After securing the clamp, double check that you've tied off the bag. There's nothing worse than realizing you forgot to close the bag, after the diapers are already in the pail.

, Depending on whether you have the Diaper Genie or the Diaper Genie Elite, you’ll do this in one of two ways. To open the Diaper Genie, lift the lid from the top. To open the Elite, use your foot to press the petal at the bottom of the Genie. If you smell an odor coming from your Diaper Genie, without the Genie being opened, it's time for a clean out.
Wash your Diaper Genie out with soapy water. Wipe it down with a bleach-based cleaner, then allow it to dry in the sun., Push the diaper through the Diaper Genie’s clamp until it disappears from sight. You’ll want to make sure that the clamp shuts completely; otherwise you run the risk of odors and leaks.To fit the maximum number of diapers inside your Genie, roll the diapers tightly.To prevent the contents of the diaper from spilling out during transit, secure the diaper using the diaper’s adhesive tabs.

, If you have the Diaper Genie Elite, remove your foot from the pedal to shut the can. If you have the original Genie, shut the lid manually. If you are unable to close the Diaper Genie, this means it is too full and it’s time to refill the cartridge.If your Diaper Genie is not full and it's still not closing, there may be a diaper obstruction you can't see. Check to make sure pieces of diaper are not stuck in your Diaper Genie lid.If you are still unable to close your Diaper Genie lid, the spring-loaded mechanism may have failed.

Find a preferred method for checking the status of the diaper.",How to Identify and Change a Soiled Diaper1,"


You could feel the diaper for fullness or ""being squishy"" though sometimes the diaper brand may be so absorbent that you wouldn't be able to feel for the fullness and sometimes you could accidentally squeeze out the very thing you didn't want to come out in the first place (e.g. feces, poop).
You could look at the diaper or pants the child is wearing for signs of leakage or stains but by then it would probably be too late and diaper rash would have set in and you would have to rummage through all your baby first aid things only to find the empty tube of diaper rash cream.

Once the child’s bottom is dry, lift up their rear into the air again a few inches and slip the fresh diaper up underneath the child’s bottom, with the flaps in the back and stopping at the small of the back thus providing a comfortable fit for the child.,
Now, one at a time, take hold of a flap and fold it over to the designated colorful spot on the front end of the diaper.,
PRESTO!,
If necessary, change the baby's clothing.",How to Identify and Change a Soiled Diaper2," A cloth-lined, plastic changing pad, bought at any baby and children store or superstore). If you do not have a changing pad, then a regular towel will do, but make sure it is clean and that afterwards, if there are any stains, that you wash the towel clean immediately in cold water and laundry detergent, and hang to dry.

, Now that the baby is on the floor, gather the supplies needed. These include but are not limited to: A clean diaper of your choice, baby wipes of your choice, diaper rash cream, baby powder, a clean change of clothes, a blanket to wrap a tiny baby in when cold, and a toy or book or pacifier to entertain the child with. It is a good idea not to give the child a bottle at this time as the child may associate diaper changes with feeding and that may not work out so well with some parents.

,


Start removing the diaper. Now that the baby is entertained, proceed in peeling back the flaps of the old diaper, lifting the child’s rear end up a few inches into the air and removing the diaper. Keeping the child’s rear in the air, reach for a baby wipe and wipe the child downward from genitalia to anus.
It is absolutely important that when dealing with females, that you always wipe from vulva to anus. NEVER from the anus to the vulva as this can cause a serious vaginal infection if bacteria enter the vagina.

,, Now that the child is clean and fresh, apply the diaper rash cream and/or baby powder to the child’s bottom, if you want, and let air dry. Take this time to unfold the fresh diaper, pulling out the two flaps located at the back and stretching them a bit so they will be more comfortable to the child. If your child is a newborn, now would be a good time to wrap the infant in a blanket to keep him/her warm until their bottom is dry.

, Now take the front of the diaper and fold it loosely over the child’s genitalia, letting it rest just below the belly button (don’t forget to blow a few raspberries for the older children in diapers to make them laugh).

, If the child is still very young and still has his/her umbilical cord attached, keeping the diaper off the umbilical cord is very important for hygienic reason. Folding over the protruding end of the diaper, or cutting out a hole beforehand can help evade infection.

, Congratulate yourself for you have learned now to recognize and change a soiled diaper!

, Take this time to replace the child’s soiled clothing the fresh clothing you have pulled out for him/her.

If you see red dots scattered around these areas, it might be a bacterial or yeast infection causing their diaper rash.The rash may present as red spots, similar in color to raw beef, that look inflamed. It may also have sharp, raised borders.If your baby took antibiotics, they may have contracted a yeast infection. See your child’s doctor if home care doesn’t help the rash, as yeast is a fungus and special ointment may be warranted., The most common cause of diaper rash is friction from too-tight diapers or clothes.Look directly at your baby’s buttocks or the inner thighs for signs of a rash. Check under the elastic areas covered by the baby’s diaper. If the rash is concentrated in these area, friction may be a cause of the diaper rash., Stool enzymes and irritants such as harsh soaps, baby wipes, detergents or topical medication can also cause diaper rash. These cases often occur on the exposed areas of skin such as on the round part of the buttocks. They generally don’t appear in skin folds and creases.Irritant rashes may also appear on other parts of the body exposed to these substances.Eliminate potential irritants one by one until you figure out which one is causing the diaper rash.

, A baby’s skin can be sensitive or allergic to things such as diapers, wipes, detergents, lotions, and foods.An allergy rash also generally presents on exposed areas. It looks like a poison oak rash.These often have red, inflamed skin and bumps or blisters that itch.Recognize that an allergic rash may occur in combination with an irritant rash.It may also appear on other parts of the body exposed to the allergen.This may also be contact dermatitis, a skin reaction to something your baby touched., Moist heat can cause a common form of diaper rash called intertrigo. This occurs in the deep folds of a baby’s skin. Intertrigo presents as thin-looking skin. It may even look like the skin has lost several layers.Intertrigo rashes can also occur on other parts of the body exposed to heat or moisture.This is especially true for sensitive skin under the chin.Miliaria, a type of prickly heat rash, can also present like diaper rash.

, If you detect a salmon-colored rash with greasy skin and yellowish scales, the child may have seborrheic rash.This type of diaper rash may be worse in skin folds or even appear on other parts of the body.A seborrheic rash may also indicate atopic dermatitis or Seborrheic dermatitis, or eczema in rare cases. These conditions usually affect areas other than the diaper area. Consult your child’s doctor if the rash doesn’t go away with home care., Diaper rash generally responds well to home treatment.Moist skin or exposure to fecal matter often causes diaper rash. Changing the baby’s diaper as soon as you notice it is soiled can relieve cases of diaper rash. It may also prevent future outbreaks.Avoid fastening the diaper too tightly. This can keep soiled parts close to the skin and make the diaper rash worse., The best treatment for diaper rash is making sure the child’s skin is clean and dry. Gently wipe away any urine or fecal matter before putting on a new diaper.Clean the area with warm water and a soft washcloth or scent- and alcohol-free baby wipe.Pat the area dry to minimize further irritation.

, Swipe a thin layer of a product such as zinc oxide, petroleum jelly, or diaper paste on the affected area. This can soothe the skin and protect it from further exposure to moisture and/or irritants.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for specific recommendations on protective creams. They may suggest A + D, Balmex, Desitin, or Triple Paste. Some may also recommend Lotrimin for a diaper rash caused by yeast.

Try ointments made of witch hazel, calendula, or aloe vera. These can effectively soothe diaper rash and promote healing.Use products designed for babies. Avoid anything containing baking soda, boric acid, camphor, phenol, benzocaine, diphenhydramine, or salicylates. These ingredients may be toxic to babies.
Wipe away the product as needed. This may be at every diaper change or once a day., Expose your baby’s skin to the air as much as possible. This could include letting them go without a diaper for short periods during the day and avoiding airtight plastic pants. This can treat diaper rash and prevent future outbreaks.Use a larger diaper than usual until the diaper rash disappears. This increases airflow to the baby’s skin.
Avoid overdressing your baby in winter. Loosen their clothing when you are inside during this time of year to prevent irritation and keep moisture from developing.

, Give your baby a warm bath until the diaper rash clears. Wash them with a mild, fragrance-free soap. Lightly pat them dry. Increase airflow by letting the baby be naked for a few minutes after the bath., Switch to different products if your baby’s diaper rash is a result of disagreeable diapers and wipes, detergents, or food. Keeping them out of the heat and can also help relieve and prevent diaper rash.It may take a few tries to figure out what specific irritant is causing the diaper rash.

Use products that are labeled scent-, fragrance-, and dye-free.

, In some cases, a baby may need medical treatment for diaper rash. Let the doctor know when the rash started and what you’ve done to treat it at home. Seek medical attention if your baby’s diaper rash:Persists for three days or more
Gets worse
Is more red-dotted than solid, which can indicate a yeast infection
Is accompanied by a fever
Seems very painful
Presents with blisters or pus-filled sores, which can indicate Impetigo., Depending on the severity of the diaper rash, your doctor may prescribe different medications to treat it. Following any dosing and application instructions your doctor provides. Your doctor may prescribe the following for more severe cases of diaper rash:Hydrocortisone cream
Antifungal cream for fungal and yeast infections
Topical or oral antibiotics for bacterial infections

, Some cases of diaper rash may keep coming back. The best way to figure out the reason is seeing your pediatrician, who can rule out more serious conditions such as a staph infection, malabsorption syndromes, or allergic contact dermatitis.The following may also help prevent or relieve recurrent diaper rash:

Removing potential food allergens such as cow’s milkTrying scent-, alcohol-, and detergent free diapers, wipes, and cleansersSwitching to natural fabric, breathable clothing that isn’t too tight
Discontinuing use of baby powders or cornstarch on the affected area

"
Look at your baby's diapers carefully.,
Ask yourself ""Is the baby in pain?"",
Go over to your child, and see how many fingers you can comfortably fit into the containment area of the child's diaper, assuming it hasn't been too fully soaked in urine yet.

,
Release the child's diaper-tapes just a little bit.,
Take note of how much urine the diaper has absorbed.,
Look for rashes on the child's waistline that could be caused from the diapers being too small.,
Look for an un-snug fit on the baby with their diaper's leak guards.,
Buy bigger disposable diapers if the diaper tapes can't be readjusted any closer than the edge of the diaper itself.

",How to Determine the Right Time to Purchase Bigger Disposable Diapers for Your Baby or Infant," Sometimes, an answer can be spotted quickly.;
, as you look at the baby's diaper area. Sometimes you can spot it being too tight without touching it!

,, Releasing the tapes may ease the pain in some instances, but don't back down just yet.

, The child could be crying because the diapers are too small to fit around their waistline, and they feel cramped.Look for the child's diaper to be super-saturated in urine, which may make the child feel uneasy and feel ""cramped"" inside the diaper all the time. Until they get bigger diapers, expect their crying to continue endlessly.

, But try not to touch any part of the rash, as you could scratch it off and cause a worse rash or infection on your baby.

, Continue to use your current diapers, but help pull out the leak-guards better from the side walls of the diaper when you unfurl the diaper and get it ready for use. When opening the diaper, run two consecutive fingers of one of your hands up the entire length of the edges of the inside linings (in tandem on the inside of the diaper) of the diaper. This will help release the static cling from the manufacturing process at the diaper factory on the production date.

Understand the risk factors for premature birth.,
Be aware of some of the common problems experienced by premature babies.",How to Observe Premature Infant Behavior," There are three different ways of calculating your premature baby's age, all of which must be taken into account when tracking your baby's growth and development.


The term gestational age refers to the baby's age as calculated from the mother’s first day of her last menstruation cycle. This number is very important for identifying your infant's development and growth levels before birth.
Your baby's chronological age refers to the age that is calculated from the point that the infant is born. This term describes the age for all the newborns, and it represents your own age.
The last term is called the corrected age which refers to the correct age of your infant as if he continued his natural uterine journey. It’s calculated by subtracting the number of weeks your baby was premature from his chronological age. For example, if your infant was born four weeks early, and his age now is twelve weeks, this means that his corrected age equals eight weeks (Chronological age “12” – Early weeks time “4” = Corrected age “8”).
It's important to understand that while a premature baby's development may be slow in terms of their chronological age, it might be right on track in terms of their corrected age. Therefore, it's important to keep the corrected age in mind when watching out for issues with growth and development.;
, Premature babies tend to gain weight more slowly than full-term babies, but this is usually not a cause for concern. A record is kept with the doctor and chart is plotted on a graph to check whether the baby's weight gain is on track.


Full-term babies usually gain weight at a rate of 30 ounces per day. However, the rate of weight gain will be slightly different for a premature baby.
Premature baby’s tend to gain weight at a slightly slower rate than full-term. Hence keeping weight records helps you and your doctor to understand and track their progress.

, Premature babies have underdeveloped lungs and they may have low cry or even end up with respiratory difficulties. Therefore, it's important to watch out for any respiratory distress signs once the baby is discharged from the hospital.


If your baby is experiencing respiratory issues, they may find it difficult to breathe, have shallow breathing or need to work hard to breathe. You can tell if this is happening if the baby is flaring their nostrils, takes more than 50 breaths per minute, or starts to turn blue.
As soon as you notice any of these signs, your baby should be rushed to the hospital. If your child is prone to respiratory problems; keeping a nebulizer at home might also be helpful. A nebulizer is a device which is used to administer medicines for any respiratory problems.

, Premature babies are prone to infections, as their immune system is not yet fully developed. Hence these kids tend to have low immunity and are particularly prone recurrent ear infections.


Depending on the severity of the infection, ear drops and acetaminophen for fever can be administered - just be sure to consult with your doctor first.
Also remember to sit your baby in a semi-upright position while breast feeding - otherwise the breast milk can trickle down to the ears and cause an infection.

, Premature baby's are prone to a number of eye conditions, such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) which is a medical condition that usually happens with premature baby's of early gestation, due to the incomplete development of tiny blood vessels in their eyes. In severe cases, this condition can lead to blindness.


Your pediatrician will observe any signs of this condition at your regular appointments and will transfer you to a specialized eye doctor for treatment.
Another condition sometimes found in premature babies is strabismus or crossed eyes. However, this condition often heals itself if the baby continues to develop normally.

, Premature infants develop more slowly and hence have delayed milestones. For example, you should take note of when your child first lifts his head off the bed. For a full-term baby, this should ideally happen at 2 months.


Noting how long it takes for your premature baby to reach certain milestones will help you to identify if your baby is developing normally (albeit more slowly) or whether there may be a deeper developmental issue.

, A baby will ideally start picking things up at around 4 months, but in premature babies this can be little delayed.


By 9 months, most babies will have mastered the pincer grasp i.e picking up objects between the thumb and fingers, proving fine motor development has occurred. This may also be delayed in premature infants.

, Normally developing babies tend to start smiling at people around three months, while premature babies may take longer.


Full-term infants learn to roll over or move their limbs by four months, while premature babies take an extra 2 to 3 months to reach these milestones.
Babies will usually try to ""speak"" in mono syllables by 5 to 6 months, so pay attention if your baby says ""mama"", ""papa"", ""gaga"" or anything of that sort.

, Crawling usually starts by 9 months in full-term babies, but it may take premature babies up to a year. Following on from this, full-term babies often start walking at the age of 12 months, but premature babies take longer.

, There are also some positive signs to watch out for which indicate that your baby is growing and developing normally. These are also important to take note of, as they will help to put your mind at ease.


Some good signs include: your baby being relaxed - which you can tell by his facial expressions and the movement of his legs and arms, your baby making noises and sounds, sucking on his fingers, lifting his legs up and displaying normal mood changes (not suddenly being aggressive or sleepy).
All of these things show that your baby is on the right path in terms of muscle development and that he is gaining more control over his muscles.

, Try to exclusively breastfeed your premature baby for 6 months before starting them on other food. By breastfeeding the baby exclusively for 6 months you give them the necessary antibodies they need to fight infection.


Babies can’t produce their own antibodies until 6 months of age, so they survive on antibodies made by the mother.
Hence, it is advised to breastfeed at least until the baby can produce his own antibodies, so he can build his immunity and not fall sick.

, Your premature baby may need from eight to ten feedings every day. Try to space these feeding evenly throughout the day.


Don't feed your baby less than 8 times per day or he may get dehydrated due to the lack of fluids.
You can tell that your baby is well-fed and hydrated by the number of diapers you change each day. Changing six or seven diapers a day is a sign of good nutrition.

, Kangaroo mother care is encouraged for premature babies. This is a process whereby the mother is encouraged to hold the baby close to her chest, allowing the baby's body to follow the mothers respiratory and heart rate.


This enhances the baby's circadian rhythm and promotes their overall health.

, Make sure to attend all scheduled appointments with the pediatrician so your baby's growth, development and overall health is properly monitored.


The pediatrician will ensure that your baby has all of the required vaccinations to prevent illness and infections.
Don't hesitate to ask the pediatrician about any questions or concerns you might have regarding your baby's development. They will be happy to answer your questions and put your mind at ease.

, If you need to travel anywhere with your baby, be sure to use a special car seat designed for premature babies. These tend to be smaller and more secure.


A newborn baby's Car Seat should always be placed securely in the back seat of the car, and should be rear facing.
If you're still worried, have someone sit beside the baby while you're driving for additional safety.

, It' very important to put your baby to sleep on his back rather than on his stomach, to avoid any stomach or gastric problems. This can also help to prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), a condition often responsible for infant deaths.

, There are several conditions and circumstances that make giving birth to a premature baby more likely. These include:


Diabetes: The imbalance of sugar and insulin predisposes a diabetic mother to early uterine contractions and premature delivery.
Hypertension: High blood pressure during pregnancy can stimulate early delivery. It causes excessive release of proteins in the urine which can lead to condition called pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, which accelerates preterm labor.
Smoking: Smoking causes vasodilation (constriction of blood vessels). This poses a great threat, as it decreases the blood supply to the placenta and initiates labor.
Infections like rubella, mumps, measles, syphilis etc could pose threat to early deliveries. Infections tend to release prostaglandins which are the same substances that are used to initiate the labor.
Teen pregnancy: Teenagers tend to experience more stress during pregnancy which isn’t good for the baby, as the excessive release of stress hormones can induce labor.

, Premature infants are at slightly higher risk for everything (compared to a full-term baby) since they don’t have enough time for development in the womb. However, some of the most common problems include:


Breathing problems. Since their lungs haven’t fully developed premature babies face breathing issues. They are usually given steroids to increase the lung functioning keep them stable.
Temperature problems. Pre-term infants have low levels of fat on their body due to early birth. This causes instability in body temperature, as they are unable to retain heat properly.
Feeding problems. Premature babies are often weak and lethargic. This is because their muscles aren’t well developed and hence they tend to have feeding issues.
Jaundice. As the body isn’t developed completely, it finds it difficult to flush out the bilirubin (a yellow pigment found in bile) produced by the liver, giving the baby a yellow color.
Infection. Premature babies are prone to infections due to decreased immunity and a lack of antibodies in their systems.

Don’t dump diapers in the recycling bin!,
Purchase a separate, hands-free bin for diaper disposal.,
Flush solid waste down the toilet.,
Roll up the diaper around the dirty inner lining.,
Put the rolled-up diaper in your diaper pail and close the lid.,
Remove the garbage bag liner when your bin is full.,
Sanitize the inside of the bin with soap and disinfectant.",How to Dispose of Diapers1," No matter where you live or how passionately you believe in recycling, the fact is that disposable diapers simply aren’t recyclable. Faced with a load of dirty diapers, recycling facilities have to sort out these contaminants in order to make sure they don’t damage other recyclable materials, such as paper and plastic. This makes their whole system less efficient and more expensive.If you’re worried about the ecological impact of your diaper waste—after all, normal disposable diapers can take up to 500 years to break down in a landfill—try buying diapers labeled as eco-friendly or biodegradable.;
, You need to keep diaper waste separate from other garbage and food waste, so keeping a discrete, washable container with a lid is essential. Purchase a bin with a foot pedal that opens the lid so that you don't have to touch the bin with your dirty hands. Also be sure that you line the bin with a plastic garbage bag so that waste doesn’t touch the sides of the bin.Even if you have a locked closet or maintenance room where you can store your diaper disposal bin, make sure your container is reasonably kid-proof. Purchase a tall, bottom-weighted bin so that your child can’t tip it over or reach into the bin.
Some people prefer to buy diaper genies, which seal each diaper into individual bags. If you go this route, just know that the plastic bagging system probably won’t eliminate odor or hygienic hazards entirely., Getting rid of the solid waste from your baby’s diaper before disposal will reduce odor and bacteria, as well as make it so that your diaper bin doesn’t fill up quite so quickly. Using gloves or a piece of toilet paper, remove the waste with your hand and drop it into the toilet.


Depending on where you live, you may not be required to take this step. In the U.S., for example, disposable diapers and their contents are considered municipal solid waste, meaning that they may be safely disposed without first emptying out the solid waste., In order to keep the diaper from smearing or dumping its contents once it’s in the disposal bin, roll it up into a tight coil. Use the adhesive strips on the side to help seal it closed.

, Storing your dirty diapers in a special, closable diaper pail will keep the bacteria-ridden human waste from contaminating other surfaces and items in your home. Just be sure that you place the diaper into the bin by using the foot pedal, as opening the lid with your hands can infect the lid and outer surface of the container.If you’re using latex gloves to protect your hands, put these into the diaper bin along with the soiled nappies.

, As soon as the volume of dirty diapers in your pail reaches the brim, you should transfer it to the outdoor trash bin. Just don’t wait until your diaper pail is overflowing or jammed-up, as this can increase the likelihood of contamination.


If you’re running out of space, either empty the pail and take it to an outdoor garbage bin, or purchase a second pail to store overflow from the first.

, While the container is still empty, clean out the inside with soap and water in order to get rid of dirt and grime. Then spray it with a household disinfectant or bleach to kill germs and bacteria.If you find that a lingering stench clings to your diaper pail even after frequent cleanings and disinfectants, try sprinkling some baking soda, cloves, or old coffee grounds in the bottom. Dryer sheets and coffee filters may also help mitigate stubborn smells."

Pack some sealable plastic bags into your portable diaper kit.,
Roll the used diaper into one of your plastic bags.,
Locate a waste bin in an appropriate location.,
Store soiled diapers in a separate bag if you’re in the wilderness.",How to Dispose of Diapers2," Chances are, you already have a baby-care kit containing necessary supplies such as diapers, snacks, wipes, and toys. To make sure you’re always ready to discreetly and safely dispose of your baby’s diapers, tuck a few sturdy plastic bags into this kit and make sure you renew your supply daily.


Plastic bags with zips are particularly helpful, as they’ll keep waste and moisture contained in the event that you have to travel with the bag for a period of time. You can also find scented bags at many baby supply and general retail stores., While your home diaper disposal routine might not include this step, it’s essential when you’re out of the house. Pop it into one of the bags you’ve brought along and tightly seal it before looking for an appropriate waste basket to put it in.If you’re near a toilet, you can remove and flush any solid waste before doing this in order to minimize bulk and smell.

, While it may seem like all trash is created equal, think again. Another person’s home, a restaurant or office, or out the car window are all unhygienic an inappropriate options. Only get rid of your diaper-containing plastic bag in an outdoor bin or one located in a bathroom. If you’re at a friend’s house, ask where you can dispose of the diaper.If none of these hygienic options are readily available, you’ll have to carry your bag with you until you find one.

, Disposable diapers pollute the environment if you leave them out, so you’ll need to carry your dirty diapers around with you if you’re camping, hiking or on some other outdoor adventure. If you’re too squeamish to handle this dirty job, use a public campground or well-maintained trail which provides regularly serviced dumpsters."

Check out local laws and services available in your area.,
Evaluate your resources to compost at home.,
Sort wet diapers from those with solid waste.,
Rip open the diaper so that the filling falls out.,
Mix the newly dumped filling into your compost heap.,
Cover any visible diaper filling with soil or compost.",How to Dispose of Diapers3," While most places around the world require that disposable diapers be placed in regular waste bins bound for the landfill, some cities are attempting to reduce diaper waste by providing compost service. In Toronto, for example, you can dump your dirty nappies—along with cat litter and pet waste—into a separate bin that goes to the city compost facility.Be sure to read guidelines carefully to make sure composting services accept diapers. Portland, for example, runs a composting program that collects food scraps and other organic waste, but it does not accept diapers., If you have a back yard and a pre-existing compost heap, you can probably do your own dirty diaper compost. If not, consider hiring a compost service that will do the dirty work for you. These services pick up your diapers, take them to a large composting facility, and process the waste.Just make sure that you don’t dump your diaper waste into a food garden compost pile. Only put bacteria-laden diaper waste into a compost pile you use for flowers, shrubs, and other vegetation not intended for human consumption.

, Composting is a great way to reduce diaper waste, but you should only do so with urine-soaked diapers. Professional, large-scale composting facilities can accept both forms of waste because they can reach the high temperatures needed to destroy constituent bacteria, but your home compost pile cannot.Throw out the diapers containing solid waste in the usual fashion.

, Once you’ve accumulated two or three days worth of wet diapers, put on some gloves and take the pile out to your compost heap. Hold each diaper above the heap and tear it open, starting on the side that would have been worn on your baby’s front side. The filling is fully compostable and most often made of sodium polyacrylate and wood pulp, also known as cellulose.The rest of the diaper’s lining, plastic, and paper is not compostable. Set it aside and dispose of it with your other diapers containing solid waste.

, Using a shovel or long hoe, distribute the filling around the heap so that it’s not all lumped in one place. Mix it into the top layer of pre-existing compost so that the fibers will begin to break down., A successful compost pile will break down constituent materials while producing minimal odors. In order to make sure that your diaper filling begins to break down as quickly as possible, layer about half an inch of soil or lower-layer compost on top of it. If you do this correctly, you should see visible results within a month.

Let the rash linger for a day or two.,
Open the baby's diaper and look at their genital region.,
Look for how much of a rash the child has.,
Determine if the rash is a result of the use of any antibiotics the child is taking (or has previously taken within the last two weeks).,
Smell the genital area.,
Look for a discharge from a girl's body.,
Look for a whitish rash around the boy's penis, along with a scaly, bright red rash on their scrotum.",How to Determine if Your Baby Has a Diaper Rash or Yeast Skin Condition," Most diaper rashes will go away without treatment, however, don't let it linger on for too long.;
, Look for a color inconsistency or rash. if the rash is patchy red, it is a diaper rash. If the rash is red, raised and is located in a patchy area with sharp jagged borders, and also contains spots in the diaper area, this rash is not a generic diaper rash, but is a yeast infection.

, If the rash is rash covers the entire genital area, it almost certainly is a diaper rash as well.

, If the rash is the result of antibiotics and is located around the genitals or a larger area (such as located around the baby's buttocks) this rash is the result of a yeast infection/rash.

, If you notice a smell, this is indeed a yeast infection. Only yeast infections have a foul smell that can linger on if not treated in time.

, This is a classic sign of a yeast infection.

, These are signs of a yeast infection too.

Take your baby to the dentist.,
Wipe your baby’s gums after feeding.,
Brush your baby’s teeth.,
Feed only breast milk and formula to babies.,
Give bottles with water only during naps or at bedtime for toddlers.When babies fall asleep with bottles, they often keep the nipple in their mouths, allowing milk or juice to drip into their mouths and pool around the teeth and gums.,
Take the bottle away when your child's asleep.,
Do not dip pacifiers in honey or sugar.,
Limit juice intake.,
Limit sugar intake in general.,
Give your child water between meals.,
Wean your child off a bottle.",How to Prevent Baby Bottle Tooth Decay," The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and the American Dental Association recommend that a baby get her first visit to the dentist after the first tooth emerges, no later than her first birthday. The dentist will check for signs of tooth decay or other oral problems.Additionally, the dentist can teach you how to better care for your baby's teeth.Try to take your child to the dentist every six months.;
, If your infant has no teeth, use a clean, damp cloth to wipe her gums down after a bottle. This process will remove the damaging bacteria and help prevent the sugar from formula or breast milk from getting trapped in between your baby’s lips and gums. Even if your baby does have a few teeth, wiping out her mouth after each feeding can help prevent tooth decay., If your infant has any emerged teeth, use a child-size toothbrush and kid-friendly toothpaste to clean her mouth twice each day, particularly prior to bedtime. Only use a little bit of toothpaste, about as much as a grain of rice, until she is about 3.Be sure to be gentle with young teeth. Brush both the teeth and gums and then rinse out your baby's mouth. Once a child has reached three, you can use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste.Make sure the toothpaste you use has fluoride, as that will help protect your child's teeth., For children under one year of age, don't give them anything but formula or breast milk in their bottles. Juice and milk are too sugary, and water can lead to malnutrition., The sugar in the drinks gives incentive for bacteria to stay on teeth, causing decay.It's best not to give any bottles at naps or bedtime, but if you must, then make sure to only put water in them.


The exception to this rule is babies who haven't started eating solid foods yet. Babies who are still solely on breast milk, formula, or a combination of both do not need extra water in their diet. In fact, feeding them extra water can lead to malnutrition or other problems.If your child is ambivalent about the bottle or does not insist on holding the bottle or drinking once she lays down, try brushing teeth before bed and simply skipping the bottle. It also helps to offer milk at dinnertime., If just giving water doesn't work, you can try removing the bottle once your child falls asleep. That removes the liquid that could cause damage to her teeth.Most doctors prefer that you don't let your child fall asleep with a bottle at all; it can make it harder for your child to be weaned from the bottle.Offer a pacifier instead of a bottle if your baby wants something to suck.
Don't forget to gently wipe her mouth out after you remove the bottle.

, Coating the nipple of the pacifier with any type of sugary substance (including juice and milk, which contain natural sugars) can trap sugar in the front of your child’s mouth. This practice allows bacteria to gather and can cause tooth decay., If you want to give your child juice, limit her to six ounces a day. It's best to let her drink it during meals so it doesn't sit on her teeth. If you want to extend the amount because your child refuses plain water at meals, try mixing the juice with water.Offer juice only in a cup, not a bottle.

, Every kid loves sweet things, but you should try to limit how much sugary foods your child eats, from candy to soda. Encourage her to eat fruits and vegetables instead., If your child needs a drink between meals, fill her bottle or sippy cup with water. That way, she's not constantly sipping on sugar, which can lead to tooth decay., At about six months, show your child how to use a sippy cup. At about a year, it's time to wean your child off the bottle. Bottles encourage drinking over time, leaving the liquid on your child's teeth. Sippy cups help limit this effect.If she cries persistently without the bottle, try feeding your child the milk yourself, cleaning her teeth, and putting her down with just water. Or, you can try giving your baby a pacifier instead.
In some cases, children lose interest in sleeping with a bottle if it is filled with water, in which case you can stop providing one at all.

, A diaper that moves like jelly is mostly wet and will need to be changed soon (or immediately)., and take a look for yourself. But do this in hygienic places. Not in the middle of the street.

Determine whether you will use cloth diapers or disposable diapers.,
Look at the pail design.,
Check the locking mechanism on the lid.,
Decide if you want a pail that uses regular trash bags or custom diaper bags.,
Choose how you would like the pail to open.,
Read customer reviews.,
Make a list of diaper systems that you like.

,
Go to a store and try the pails.,
Choose the diaper system that works best for you based on your preferences and budget.

",How to Choose a Diaper Pail," You can store cloth diapers in both dry and wet diaper pails. If you choose the dry method, you can use the same pails as disposable diapers, but pails that require special bags will not be a good fit as they lock diapers in individual bags. This does not allow access to launder the soiled diapers.

, Pails with a handle and pour spout are easier to carry and make it convenient to dump waste water.


Choose pails that are lightweight. Pails will become much heavier once they contain water.

, Wet pails should lock securely. Small children can fall into unsecure diaper pails and become trapped.

, Some brands of pails use special bags that you must purchase to use with the diaper system. These bags lock in odors and some brands wrap each diaper in an individual bag. They are not recommended as dry pails for cloth diapers.


Consider the cost associated with these bags since most children are not potty trained until age 2 or 3. Other pails use regular trash bags and are an inexpensive option over the long run. However, these pails may not lock in odors as effectively as pails that use special bags.;
, You can choose from hands free, motion sensor, foot pedal, push button, or locked lid options. Many systems have a large lid that you remove to empty the pail and replace trash bags and a smaller lid that you open to throw away dirty diapers. This is an added safety feature to prevent the child from opening the pail and falling in and it helps to trap odors within the pail.

, Search through store websites and read what other people thought of the different diaper systems. Find out if the pails you are considering live up to their claims.

,, Many stores that sell baby items will have display models for you to look at.


Open and close different pails to see if they are easy to use. Practice with 1 hand.
Look at the pail accessories and replacement bags. Consider the price of the bags and odor pellets and see if they are readily available.
Compare prices to other models.
See if the directions are easy to follow.

In case of soiling accidents it is usually easy to smell and you may have noticed they were standing in an easy discoverable ""soiling"" position and even heard them farting loud. With more independent teens, you can ask them if they need a diaper change. If they are less independent, you may need to do a visual check. Quickly peek inside the back and front of the diaper to see if it is wet or soiled.


They may resist your need to check if they need a diaper change, so be sensitive to their feelings; try to respect their privacy and dignity as you check. Try to do the visual check discretely although it can be impossible to do without exposing their diaper at least partly. Try also to make them understand that if they tell you every time they need a diaper change, you don't need to do any checks and exposing their diaper to others. If possible, you can develop common code words/phrases, such as saying, “Do you need a break?/I need a break” A break meaning a diaper change. You could also say ""It doesn't smell like roses here - do you need to get some fresh air?/I need some fresh air""
It is important to change the diaper immediately when you suspect it may be soiled. Delaying changes can contribute to the development of incontinence and urinary tract infections.The frequency of changes depends on a number of factors (health of the person, etc.), but a teen diaper should be replaced between 5-8 times during a day. If possible, create a changing schedule and adjust it as necessary for additional dirty diapers.;
, If you are in a home setting, head into the restroom area or a room with extra space. If you are “out and about” it gets a bit more challenging. Go to a public restroom and head into an extra-large stall, a handicapped stall or a separate family restroom, if one is available. It is important that the space is big enough for the both of you to move around in and that it is clean. Sometimes you may find a restroom with an extra large changing table


Make this move discretely, avoiding creating a scene or public affair. If you are around other people, simply say, “Excuse us for a moment, we’ll be right back,” and leave it at that.
If you have options, always choose the bathroom stall with extra handrails and/or purse shelves (for changing supplies)., Always lock the bathroom door behind you. If there are people standing outside of the bathroom area, feel free to ask them to give you some space as well. Likewise, if you are in a public space, use hushed tones when completing the change. Do not complain aloud or you will further frazzle and embarrass the teenager.

, If you are out, you should carry a sturdy diaper bag that contains the following: diapers, disposable underpads, wipes, barrier skin cream, a pair of gloves, and hand sanitizer. Unpack these items and place them nearby for the changing process. If the teenager is able, you might ask them to assist by holding the wipes or the fresh diaper.The disposable underpad is just one of many options to provide a barrier between the teen and the changing surface. Underpads are waterproof, thin, and bed-sized, however, they can be costly. Other options are a folded shower curtain or waterproof picnic blanket. Finally you can make a thin but padded changing mattress covered in soft vinyl that can be folded or rolled so it is suitable for travelling with your teen.
It is easy to forget, or run out, of one of these necessary items. Every time before you go out, do a quick inventory of your diaper bag to make sure you have what you may need.
If you are in a public restroom and cannot set out the items, leave them in the bag and pull them out and put them back as needed. The fewer supplies that are contaminated with germs, the better.

, If you need to move something to make additional room on the floor in a room, do so. Pay attention to the temperature as well. You do not want the room to be too hot or too cold as it will make the changing process all the more uncomfortable. Adjust the thermostat if you can and if it is necessary.

, If your teen is not able to stand up independently or has soiled the diaper heavily then you will need to set up the room for a laying down change. For a laying down change, place an underpad on the ground or on a bed, if available. If a changing table is available make sure the plastic cover on the changing pad is clean by using a wipe. For seated, place the underpad on a chair seat or bench. For standing, place the underpad on the ground with reach access to a wall, if needed for support.

, Your next step should be to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer. Many people will also prefer to put on latex gloves at this point. The goal is to prevent the spreading of germs from you to the teen and vice versa., This is generally the best option for teens as it is the least stressful and usually the quickest. This position also requires very little space, making it a good choice for small restrooms and other cramped areas. Start by putting an underpad on the ground, ask the teen to stand on the underpad, then pull down their pants until they are bunched around their ankles.You will want to release the diaper side-tabs, holding the diaper in place while using the other hand to wipe clean the area, starting at the back. Once the back area is clean you can pull down the diaper, use a fresh wipe to clean the front area, and place all dirty wipes inside the soiled diaper for disposal.
If the teen needs support standing, they can grab a handrail (if available), use a walker, touch the wall or grip your shoulders for balance.
If you think the diaper is heavily soiled, use caution in this position as it will be easier to get clothing dirty or make a mess in general.

, This is a changing option in areas where seating is provided (i.e. family restroom benches) or in situations where the teen can lift themselves up from a seated position (in a wheelchair, for example), but are not fully capable of standing independently. Start by having the teen sit on a pre-placed underpad. If they are already seated, have them lift up briefly and scoot it under them. Have them raise up again to remove all lower clothing.


To remove the diaper while the teen is seated, have them stay seated as you release the diaper side tabs. Then, ask them to lift up. As they are lifted pull the diaper down toward the seat and wipe the back area, then the front. Pull out the diaper from under them and place all wipes within it, if you haven’t done so already.
Be aware that sitting position does require a degree of upper-body control on the part of the teen. However, they can always rest seated directly on the underpad between movements, if needed.

, This option can make teens feel very vulnerable and potentially embarrassed because they are diapered just like a baby in that position. However, for those teens with severely limited mobility or in case of soiling accidents, this is the best option - and also some teens prefer to be changed laying down because they are used from early childhood to have their diaper changed in this position. Starting by helping the teen to the floor, to the changing table (if available) or to the bed (if changing in a room), where they will lay upon the underpad. Remove their lower clothes completely - including plastic pants if they wear those for extra protection. Release the diaper tapes, pulling it loose, but not off.


To clean the most effectively in this position, gently push the teen’s knees chest-ward by applying pressure with your forearm behind the knees. You can also ask the teen to help by lifting their legs as high as they can. Then, wipe clean from front to back, placing used wipes in the diaper that is now released but still under them. When done, pull the soiled diaper out.When removing the clothes look for signs that the diaper has leaked. In case of wet or soiled clothes replace those with clean ones. In case of dirty plastic pants change those too. Put all wet or dirty clothes in a plastic bag.

, Regardless of position, use as many wipes as you need to in order to make them completely clean. If possible, have them help with their own cleaning needs.


When you are done cleaning, place the soiled wipes within the soiled diaper and fold it up for disposal.
Make sure to wipe the teen from front to back. This prevents the spread of fecal bacteria and is especially important when changing teen girls, FTM teen boys and non-binary teens who were AFAB., After you have finished cleaning, rub a zinc-based skin cream around the skin covered by the diaper. This will prevent chafing and rashes, especially in those teens who always wear diapers. This is an especially intimate step, so teens who are able may want to do this themselves.Some brands of diaper cream now sell aerosol cans to make application easier and cleaner. Your teen may prefer this option since you would not need to use your hands to apply the cream.
If you see a diaper rash that is dark red or heavily raised you may want to seek the advice of a doctor. Long-term rashes can get infected and lead to other health problems.

, Grab and unfold your fresh diaper and pull it up between their legs, securing it at both sides by fastening the tapes. When you are done, place their lower garments back on as they were before.


In the standing position, you will need to use one hand to hold the diaper in place and another to secure the tabs. In the sitting position, you will need to have the teen raise up in order to place the fresh diaper between their legs and secure it. In the laying down position, you will want to keep their knees bent as you place the diaper, releasing them after it is in place, then you secure the tabs.
You want the diaper to be form-fitting without any gaps around the legs or waist. Make sure that it does not impede movement. You might ask, “How does this feel? Is it too tight or okay?”

, Place the soiled diaper in the trash or in a diaper bin. Dispose of any wipes that may have fallen on the floor or elsewhere during the process. Look over the area to make sure that it appears the same as it did when you arrived.

, When you are finished it is even more important to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer, even if you were wearing gloves. It is also a good idea to ask the teen to wash their hands as well.

, Make sure that you packed everything back up into the diaper bag if you are out in public. It is very easy to forget wipes, for example, in a rush to get out of the restroom. Ask the teen to help you look around by saying, “Do you see anything I’ve missed-are we good to go?”

, To relax you both, you might say, “Stay calm, it will all be okay.” Or, “Trust me, we’ve done this many times before.” If a teen refuses to leave for a diaper change, it may also help to set a time limit on resistance, such as, “Okay, I see that you are busy, so we can wait for a bit, but come see me in five minutes.”If you feel the need to lash out or say something negative, take a deep breath and count to five.

, Recognize that your teen may be embarrassed by the diapering process. You can lessen some of these social issues by changing your teen only in private spaces, such as bathrooms. Don’t talk openly about your teen’s diapering needs and be tactful about telling your teen that it is time for a change.


It might be helpful to ask the teen if they have any suggestions that may improve the process and lessen their anxiety or embarrassment. For example, “I think we should put your supplies in this backpack, does that provide enough privacy for you? Do you have any other ideas?”

, A teenager might resist the entire diapering process. If so, be prepared for this challenge by reminding yourself to stay calm and in control. Resist the desire to physically restrain them, or to spank, as it will only cause more problems in the future.


You might channel the teen’s aggression into the diapering process by asking them to assist with preparing the supplies or the room. You could say, “Look how strong you are, could you use some of your strength to help me do this? It will go much faster.”
Tell the teen that you are only trying to help them and that it is not okay for them to hurt you in the process. You might say, “I know that you are frustrated and I understand, but you trying to hit me is wrong and you need to stop.” If you feel physically in danger, stop the diapering process and try again after a 15-minute cool down period.

, If a teen usually resists changing, be sure to offer praise if everything goes smoothly. At the end of the change, you might observe, “Thank you so much for helping out! Did you notice how quick that went?”You may want to offer an incentive for cooperative behavior in the future. For example, say, “If we have a week with no arguments over diaper changes, we will go out to your favorite restaurant.”
Try to change the diapering situation into a positive situation for both you and your teen. Use the time to talk about everything else than the diaper change. It is important not to show any signs of frustrations about having a teen who is still using diapers. However, it can be very difficult to keep up the positive attitude when you have to change diaper on a teen who has soiled his diaper heavily - but try hard even in that case to create a positive diapering situation for your teen.

, You may not be able to complete the changing process on your own, especially if your teen physically resists. If this happens, ask the teen for help and then reach out to others, if necessary. For example, when changing at home you may call-out to other family members. However, this is a last-resort as it violates the privacy of the teen.

, With the pointer, middle and ring fingers of the right hand on the inner portion, you can feel the outside of the diaper with your thumb. If it feels like it has a cloth-like outer coating, it's quite possible that it is a Huggies. Kimberly Clark has designed their process so much in the last 15 years, that their diapers no longer creek like the plastics used in Pampers and Luvs diapers (and other traditional/store-brand disposable diapers).

, Sometimes the name alone, will tell you what brand it is. Buy this particular package and disregard the brand. No two companies have the same exact name for their styles of diapers. But be careful, as, some store-brand diapers may have similar-looking names that have a few small (almost indistinguishable) differences.

, Keeping ahead of the products of a certain company (or their competitors), can keep you in-tune to possible later necessities, should the child require wearing a different style.

, This will help when ordering diapers over the Internet or by telephone.


You don't even have to write the differences down on paper, when you see them come up onscreen, but take a vigilant eye, to see what differences and new designs the company mentions and/or displays.

Keep a stash of supplies within your reach so you never have to go looking for something.For all diaper changes you will need clean diapers, baby wipes, and diaper rash ointment.
Try baby wipes that are homemade. Include in the wipes some baby soap, witch hazel extract to dry the baby, lavender to prevent diaper rash, baby oil to soften the skin, distilled water, and diaper rash cream to treat diaper rash. Having baby soap or shampoo in the wipes makes for a better clean. See the article How To Make Disposable Baby Wipes for more information and instructions.
You may not need these items for every diaper change, but it's a good idea to keep a clean pair of baby clothes and a wash cloth within reach as well, just in case you run into an extremely dirty diaper. Gloves are also handy if you want to keep your hands clean.
The bathroom is an ideal location for a changing station because you will always have access to a sink nearby.;
, If you're dealing with a particularly dirty diaper, you will want to make sure that you do not contaminate the surface. Always change the baby on a surface that can easily be cleaned.If you are changing the baby on a surface other than a changing table (like a bed or a rug), protect it with a towel or a waterproof changing pad.
Whenever you are changing your baby, you should always put them on a safe surface that they cannot fall off of. Keep at least one hand on the baby at all times to prevent falls.

, Changing a dirty diaper right away will make the task easier. Don't wait, or you may have even more of a mess to clean up., If you want to stay as clean as possible while changing a super dirty diaper, you may want to consider wearing gloves. You can use disposable gloves or thicker ones that can be washed and reused multiple times.


If you don't wear gloves, at least roll your sleeves up to keep your clothing clean.

, Take a look at the baby's clothing before you get started. If it is soiled, remove all of it before you get started. If it does not appear to be soiled, remove only what is necessary to change the diaper.If you don't already have clean clothes by the diaper changing station, be sure to get some before you begin changing the baby.

, Once the baby is lying on their back on the changing table, open the diaper so that it lies flat on the table. If the front part of the diaper is clean, use that section to wipe up as much mess off of the baby as you can. Then quickly fold the diaper in half so the baby's butt is on top of the clean outside section of the diaper.If the entire inside of the baby's diaper is dirty, do not try to use it to wipe the baby. Instead, fold the diaper in half right away and move on to the next step.
If the diaper is dirty on the outside, consider putting a clean diaper under the baby while you clean them. This will help contain the mess while you're working to get them clean.

, Once you've gotten as much mess out of the way as you can with the diaper, it's time to keep wiping with some baby wipes or damp cloths.If necessary, gently roll your baby onto one side, then the other, to thoroughly clean their skin.
If you have a baby girl, be sure to always wipe her from front to back in order to help prevent vaginal and urinary tract infections. But male babies can get penile infections.
Avoid using any wipes that contain alcohol or fragrances, as these can cause skin irritation.For a more thorough clean, always rinse your baby's bottom with some warm water. You can do this at the sink or tub, or by moistening a towel.If the baby has feces on their legs and/or back, it's best to give them a quick bath before putting them into a clean diaper.

Simply open the diaper up, slide it under the baby with one hand while you gently lift up his legs with the other hand, fold the front part of the diaper up, and secure the straps from behind.If there is another diaper under your baby, remove this one first before sliding the clean diaper in place.
Be sure to position the diaper correctly. For disposable diapers, the tabs should be in the back.

, If you use disposable diapers, roll the old one up and throw it away. If you use cloth diapers, roll the old one up and place it in a container with a tight lid until it's time to wash it.To help contain the smell, place the diaper in a plastic bag and tie it tightly before you throw it away. Plastic bags are also great for containing soiled cloth diapers when you're out.
If you need to walk away from the changing area to throw the diaper away, always bring the baby with you. Never leave him on the changing table unattended.
It's a good idea to wipe off as much poop as you can into the toilet before you throw the diaper away. This will help reduce the odor.If you wore disposable gloves, throw those in the trash as well.

, Once the new diaper is on and the old one is removed, give your baby a once over to make sure they're clean all over. If you notice any messes, clean them up with a cloth right away.


Be sure to pay extra close attention to their hands and feet, which can sometimes come into contact with the dirty diaper during changing.

, When you're all done, be sure to wash your hands and your baby's hands thoroughly, even if they do not appear dirty. Also clean and sanitize the changing surface.If you wore non-disposable gloves, wash them thoroughly before you wash your hands.

, Use a pair of sanitary plastic/latex gloves if you feel that doing so is unsanitary. However you won't need to dip them too far into the water; as long as it is enough to remove the remaining excrement that may be a bit pasty on the diaper, you should just about have enough to continue the process.This cleaning won't be perfect to remove all the poop, but it'll make your later cleaning job a ton easier.

Plan ahead.",How to Change a Disposable Diaper," Make sure the surface is dry and not cold to the touch. Stand at the edge closest to your child’s feet, with them lying down in front of you, their toes closest to your body. Remove any clothes that will impede the changing of their diaper.After laying your child down, leave them alone for a second or two before beginning to change their diaper. They’ll usually let you know if they’re feeling uncomfortable.
If you haven’t already, invest in a waterproof changing mat. They’re padded, reliable and incredibly handy considering how often diaper changes will be repeated.;
, With your child in front of you, take a clean diaper in hand. Notice the two halves (front and back) that make up the diaper. Grab the back half by its tabs on either side, with the front half curving towards yourself.Slide this back half underneath your child’s backside and dirty diaper, up to waist height. This serves both as extra padding as well as a buffer between the surface and dirty diaper.
When picking up your child’s lower half, grip their ankles with one hand (keeping a finger in between the ankles) and lift straight up.
If it seems like the dirty diaper will be an exceptional mess, consider using a clean towel or wipes under the dirty diaper and taking care of it entirely before moving on.
Double-check that the clean diaper is secure and balanced on either side before moving on. It’s far easier to adjust it now than it will be later.

, Be sure the trash can or diaper pail is close at hand for this step; the less time spent handling the messy diaper, the better. Also remember to keep one hand on or close to your child, even when managing their messy diaper.


Open the tabs of the soiled diaper and keep them open for use once complete. Pull the front half of the soiled diaper away from the child.
If your child is male, the “cover cloth” mentioned earlier will come into use here. Lay it over his penis to avoid any mess on either or you.
Use the front half of the diaper as a wipe if there’s any mess left behind on your child’s bottom.
Before moving the diaper away from them, fold it in half so the clean side faces the baby. Use the open tabs to shut the messy diaper, forming a tidy ball. Lift the child again by their ankles and remove the soiled diaper so that any dirty portion does not touch the child.
Set the diaper to the side or throw it away if you’re close enough to the receptacle.

, If you don’t have baby wipes, use damp cloth or gauze. Don’t use anything that feels especially abrasive; if it feels rough to you, it definitely will for your child. Be sure to be comprehensive when cleaning, check every nook and cranny for remaining mess to prevent infection or rash.When you wipe, do so from front to back (especially with female children) to avoid infection.
Keep the child's bottom up while you wipe off the larger bits of stool first, then wipe off the remainder of it. As you use the wipes, place the used wipes inside the soiled diaper that you just removed.
Once complete, leave your baby for a minute or so to air dry. Pat them dry with a clean towel if they’re still wet after this time.
To prevent rash you may want to include some cream or petroleum jelly before fastening a new diaper.

, Take the front half of the clean diaper by the side tabs and bring it up to your child’s waist. You’ll want to make sure that the sides are not too tight, and that the ruffle is facing out around the leg to prevent leaks (which can lead to chafing and diaper rash).


If your child is male, direct his penis towards his feet so to avoid him urinating over the diaper and onto himself.
When your child is a newborn, position the diaper so that it doesn’t cover the umbilical cord stump. There are special diapers made for newborns with folds in this specific place.
Before fastening the diaper, make sure their legs are spread and there’s as much space as possible. Doing this will avoid bunching in advance.

, Use the tabs on both halves and stick them together to fasten the new diaper. Again, make sure the fit is such that it’s not too tight but isn’t about to fall off. Check to see if there’s any bunching before replacing their clothing.Once they’ve got their clothing back on, check to see if they look comfortable as one last check of the diaper’s fit. Make sure their mobility is as it should be.

, Once the new diaper is secured, move your child from the changing surface to a safe area they can be left unattended, such as their playpen. Then return to your changing area to clean up whatever has been left behind.


Wash your hands immediately afterwards to rid yourself of any lingering mess or associated bacteria.

, You’ll want to prepare yourself, your child, and an area to change the diaper. It helps to set things up in advance, as you won’t be able to leave your child unattended once you begin. Be sure to have time set aside for this alone, as you won’t be able to start and stop again.


Wash and dry your hands. If you’ve got to keep an eye on your child, use baby wipes to clean your hands.
Find a comfortable surface on which to change the child’s diaper. Make sure it isn’t cold to the touch, and that you’ve got something padded like a towel or changing mat on which to put the child.
If you’re out of the house, you’ll want to look a for a smooth, flat area that is large enough to change your child. Do your best to make it as private as possible and as removed from others as you can make it. Ideally you’ll have a changing mat to make any flat surface into a suitable changing area.

, Again, you won’t be able to step away from the changing area once you begin, so ensure that everything is within arm’s reach. Be sure to tailor whatever you choose as a changing surface to fit every you’ll need. Fortunately it won’t require any more than a few feet of space.Here’s what you’ll need: a new disposable diaper, baby wipes, a cover cloth (for little boys), and a change of clothes (as necessary).
If you’re child is prone to rash, keep some petroleum jelly or diaper rash ointment handy.
Keep these objects out of reach of the baby and out of the way of their feet. The last you’ll want is to clean up spilt baby powder after changing your child’s diaper.

, A child can never be left unattended when changing their diaper –– accidents can occur very easily if they roll over, climb off the changing area or get caught in any items around the changing area. Because of this, you’ll want to be sure the time you have to change your child’s diaper is totally uninterrupted. While not something you can fit to a schedule, plan for it as best as possible.


If you must leave the change area for any reason before completing the change, take the child with you or ask someone else to attend to the diaper change before you walk away from the changing area.
You’ll also need to keep one hand on the child at all times unless you’ve got a changing table with some sort of strap. Even if you have the strap, however, never leave the child unattended.
Have a well-stocked diaper bag for when you’re out of the house. Unfortunately you won’t always be home when your child needs a change. If this seems like a regular possibility, consider picking up a portable changing mat for such occasions. Keep it alongside clean diapers and baby wipes for a changing station wherever you are.

",How to Change a Disposable Potty‐Training Pant," Although most often the potty-training pant will be more-so wet than soiled, there will be times when it will become soiled. The amount of wetness in the pant will depend on how long you allowed the pant to be worn and how much urine was plowed into the pant before it was noticed, or it may have just been caused by sweat backing up and may not even need to be changed at the present time.

Nothing can be more frightening to a child wearing the pant if their parents feel down into the pant itself; if you peak over and see the sag of the pant from the outside of the pant or if you smell the stinky smell of urine, it's definitely time to change that pant.
;
, Few children will still fit on a diaper-changing table which is meant for babies, and you'll need to try to use something more suited to your particular child. Although you'll need to provide a suitable place for the change to take place, you'll also need some diaper rash cream, a changing pad for which to lay down underneath the child as well as the new pant itself.

Protect the changing area from a further ""accident"" potential wetness that may occur as a result of removing the wet pant and/or laying the pant next to the child for a few moments. Either use a towel or place a waterproof changing pad on the changing surface temporarily until the child's pant have been changed.

, Remove the excess static cling that had built up upon production at the factory. Hold onto the pant's front panel with both of your hands with a five-fingered pinching grasp as you grasp the center portion of the panel with both of your hands (one next to the other), and pull gently on the front panel section away from the back section of the new pant.

Prepare a disposable potty-training pant close to the changing area. Keeping your hand on the child is of utmost concern, so preparation before grabbing the child is the top concern, for safety is on the line.

, When a disposable potty-training pant is produced at the factory, the leakguards tend to stick to the gel-like core of the absorbent material.

Stick your hand down into the pant far enough so that the side-closing straps unfurl open.
Stop pushing down into the pant when your hand touches the bottom section of the new pant (which your child's genitals will be placed in).
Take your fingers and run them over the Leakguard areas and then pull your hand back out.

, Be firm but not too rough when pulling the static away from the sides of the pant. If you pull these sides apart too rough, you are more likely to end up breaking the pant's stretchy material connecting the front half of the pant with the back half - and that hold the pant closed when the child wears them at night!, If you don't pull the pant open far enough, it will choke the child's genitals (especially those of boys) when you try to remove the pant upon replacement time the next time it gets changed. The child may then scream that ""their pant itches them"" and you don't want that to happen. For girls, this tends to be less-so, however, there have been notable times when girls will tell the person that changes them ""these things itch me."", Ask the child to lay back down on the bed or help to lay the child down on the bed. Use the protection mat as your centering area and ensure the child's diaper is laying in the direct center of this sheet. You won't need to be in the measured center of it, but you should really try to eyeball the center as best as you can. You may need to pick them up from underneath their arms and lay them gently down on the bed yourself so the affected wet pant area is directly on the pad and not overlapping any part of the remainder of the unprotected bedding., Although most often times the result of daywear, this can also include nightwear (when changing the child into their potty-training pant that morning). All clothing must be pushed back or removed to make it easy to access the pant which needs to be changed on the child.

Push back the upper half but try not to remove the upper half of a child's shirt unless they have become wet due to the accident. If they haven't become wet, fold them up several inches, so they don't impede the potty training pant-change.

, Many times a result of the special tapes of a Pull-Ups branded pant (which is Velcro), detach the tapes from the sides then grab the center and give the pant a slight forcible pull outward to each of their sides until the pant is laying out directly in front of them. Set this used pant to the side and grab the new pant to ready it for use.

You will hear the pant sides rip, and that's a very good thing at this time. (At this point, this sound is normal. Later on, this ripping sound will become a sound you don't want to hear, as it will signal a need for a brand new pant.)

While some potty training pants require the ripping away of the sides of the diaper-pant, some of the newer ones like Huggies Pull-Ups, have a better design that doesn't require much force at all to remove and refasten. The area is called the Pull-Away Zone, which is a reinforcement with a Velcro-like closing.



, Lift the child's legs using the Ankle-Hold Technique, and quickly swap out this pant., Try to determine what side of the pant is the front portion, and which item is the back. Although most often the result of a special logo icon, not all disposable potty-training pants have this special look, and you'll need to learn this pant's special features to see just what side is the back of the pant.

Look at the pants themselves to ensure that the child's pants will be going onto the child the correct way. Make sure the front of the pant is facing you. Some potty training pants may have tabs (like disposable diapers for a more-comfortable/custom form fit seal), while others might not (and have you pull them up like bedwetting diapers instead). Some may have icon-like tags on the back that denote the side, while others don't.

Most often though, you can tell by the size of one of the sides being deeper in the Leakguard area that is always going to be bigger in the rear. Look for the icon in the general place the tag of a pair of underwear would have been placed at, and if not, check for size differences.




, At first, you might want to think about putting the pant on in the diaper-format (using the pant tabs as the similarity to diaper-tabs and fastening that way), but for children who are further along in the training process, help the child slip the new pant on them. Put your hands on both of the insides of the pant so that you can help the child slip the pant on them without too much fuss and you can control the action.

Prepare the pants' Pull-Away Zone side tabs - if they have them. Open them up much like that of a regular disposable diaper to ensure you'll get the largest fit at first, or you can leave the pants tabs alone and continue on to the next step.

, Prepare the child's legs, so you can put the new pant onto the child. Lift the child's legs again, using the Ankle-Hold Technique you used earlier. 'The child's legs will need to be positioned in a completely straight line from their ankles to the knees and must still be at the same straight line past the knees up until their waistline. Keep the child's legs in this ""lifted ankle position until after the pant has been fully pulled up.

Pull the pant up by pulling on the back of the pant, all while keeping the child's legs completely straight and in the air. You may need to use your opposite hand to help hold the edge of the pant as you pull it up onto the child.

If you can reach onto the tag and pull it up from that area, kudos to you. It's beneficial to pull it up at first by the tag area, but if you can't reach it or if something else obstructs that area, pull the pant up by holding each side of the pant until the pant stops, readjust the other side then continue switching sides until the pant stops moving completely or the child says the pant has met or is even a little tight in their groin. (You'll have to fix their pant a little if it pinches them in their groin, though.)
Use one of your hands on each side of the pants to pull the pant upwards onto your child. Stop just before it reaches the child's genital area, but must be snug to the child's skin at the end. 'Try to raise both sides consistently at the same time and to the exact same height as that of a disposable diaper which should be located at till they are at or very near to the child's waistline.
If at any point you hear a ripping sound in this new pant, you've gone too far. Even if you've just started to pull up these disposable pants when you hear this ripping sound, remove this pant and start with afresh until this mandatory specification can be met without ripping.

, Pull the Pull-Away Zone/outwards (holding the back edge of the front with a few fingers of one hand and the tab-side of the pant with the other, and bring them closer to the front, if this pant is of this new construction. Pull them in to make them a bit tighter, as you move this tab closer to the front. (If this style isn't present in the pant system, disregard this step.), Change all clothes that need to be addressed so the child can begin to feel comfortable again.,"

Find a secluded space (that should be far away from any onlookers) where you can change the baby's diaper in peace without either of you being disturbed.

,
Lay the baby on the ground and change it there.,
Lay the baby on a bench (while keeping a hand and eye on them at all times) and change their diaper there.,
Use your lap to change the child's diaper, or, lay them in your arms as if in the style of trying to rock them back and forth to sleep.,

Place the baby with another suitable person while you prepare the area.

,
Grab out a changing pad or another absorbent pad (if one is available) and lay it down on the changing surface.,
Due to the fact that gravel and cement/pavement have problems, you'll tend to want and need to lay something down, so that if your baby does move their head, they won't get scratched in the neck.,
Recognize that the overall process to changing the diaper is the same, but the environment and places you can do it are going to be reduced or limited to certain things.

Take into consideration the changing method of a disposable diaper as opposed to cloth.,
Try to cover the baby's parts as best as you can.,Use plastic gloves when in public in case you can't wash your hands properly.,

Throw out the bag once you arrive at the private home or someplace where it is okay to throw out the trash.

",How to Change a Diaper in Public," Some public places have Koala Baby Changing Stations, which pull out from walls, to change your baby's diaper on in restrooms. If this is the case, change the diaper on this.;
, Some may be hard to spot, but getting the diaper changed inside a secluded space is of utmost importance, if available.

, Lay the child back and make sure they can keep their feet out of the holes in the straps where the feet go for a few moments while you change their diaper.

,, The ground is the safest place to change their diaper, since, even if the child rolls, it's a solid surface that won't allow the child to roll/slide around.

, If possible, try to find a secluded bench relatively out of sight from where people are congregating, or at least make an effort to change the diaper only on an unoccupied bench.

, When it comes time to replacing the diaper with a fresh one, you'll still need to lay them down, but it gets you a bit closer to achieving the task.

, It may be difficult to do this, especially in small cars, but try to rest the baby on the back seat and open the back seat door fully so you can access the baby. With the baby resting on the car's back seat, change him/her as you would normally.

,, If you have decided to change your child on the ground, you don't necessarily need a changing pad, though it's nice to have one available for use.

, It's not very pleasant trying to remove small sediments from the back of your babies neck, and the changing pad could have prevented that from happening.

,, Disposables take less time to change in places that would make it seem to show off your baby's nude body better. Provide yourself some leeway and use disposable diapers, though cloth does make a statement for itself too at times.

, You never know whose around.

,,, Put the dirty diaper (if disposable) inside the nearest garbage pail, or (if cloth) inside a plastic Ziploc back which you must take back with you in your diaper bag.

Start speech activities early.,
Allow your baby to listen to you speak.,
Make your home a safe, encouraging environment.,
Limit the baby's use of a pacifier.,
Start to put words in context.,
Constantly talk to your baby and encourage responses.,
Mimic any noises your baby makes.,
Address your baby by name while making eye contact.,
Read to your baby.,
Sing to your baby.,
Use positive affirmations.,
Understand that some children have more difficulty learning to speak than others.",How to Encourage Speech in a Baby," From the day your child is born, begin speaking to him and making eye contact to build a solid relationship. Your baby will recognize the sound of your voice from hearing it inside the womb.


You may sound a little different outside the womb, but the association is still there and your voice can be a calming influence to the baby.;
, Babies learn by observing: a simple conversation with your newborn can have great benefits.


As you talk to them, they will learn the importance of making different sounds and will begin to experiment with their own speech.
Even being around speech can be helpful for newborns. Talk to other adults at a normal volume so your baby can hear what a real conversation sounds like.

, Turning your home into a calm location where your baby feels safe to learn and explore will help give them confidence to learn to talk.


Background noise can distract a baby and make it difficult for them to focus on the words and sounds around them. Turn off the TV and eliminate unnecessary background noise to help your baby focus on your activities with them.
If you have older children, you can designate certain areas, such as the nursery, or certain times of day as “baby time”, where the older children work on quiet activities and you focus on speech development with your baby in a calm environment.

, As your baby gets older and shows more interest in talking, try to limit the use of a pacifier, which makes it more difficult for a child to make sounds or talk. This is easier said than done, but can have great benefits in the long run.

, As your baby grows and shows more of an interest in their surroundings, start putting things in context. Point out things around you, such as animals, simple items, or family members. This teaches an association between the word and the item itself.


It takes a vocabulary of around 100 words before a baby will begin stringing them together in a sentence, which normally happens around age two. Adding a few words to their vocabulary each day will encourage them to speak freely and improve their understanding.
Point out sounds around you, such as a car starting or a dog barking to teach your baby about other sounds beyond speech and further teach the association between sounds and words.

, Have a conversation with your baby multiple times a day and use his or her name repeatedly. Encourage any sounds they make, even if it is an unintelligible baby noise. In the early stages, any noise they make is speech progress.


As your baby begins to make more sounds, ask questions and wait for their responses, which teaches the order of a conversation and the cadence of speech. You can also model conversation by asking a question and waiting for a response, but then answering the question yourself if the baby doesn’t answer.
Provide a running commentary of daily actions, such as what you are doing as you get ready for the day or what you see on a walk. Give your baby quiet time as well, to allow him or her to experiment with her body and her voice.

, Make a big deal out of any sounds your baby makes. Mimicking their baby noises encourages them to keep experimenting with sounds and provides some needed entertainment for your baby.


Baby talk can be helpful for babies, but only in small doses. Repetitive sounds, like mama or dada, can help a child learn to speak, but some research points to it slowing down vocabulary development.
Use baby words during certain activities and use regular, slow speech during other activities to show your child real patterns in speech.

, To gain your baby’s attention, when addressing them, say their name in a slow way - while maintaining eye contact -to help them recognize it.


This will encourage them to respond when being called, even if it is initially with just a sound.
Do this when carrying out any activity with them, whether it is giving them a bath, feeding them or just playing with them.

, Reading is a powerful tool in language development and one of the most important things parents can do with their children. Books not only build a relationship between you and your baby, but also provide them with colorful pictures to stimulate the brain and words to add to their vocabulary.


Establish a habit of reading to your child daily from an early age. For newborns, it doesn’t even matter what book you are reading; an adult novel will have the same meaning to them as the phone book. As babies get older and more aware, introduce nursery rhymes, board books, and interactive picture books.
Babies will respond more to certain books depending on their personality. Read the same books over and over to solidify the message and help your baby understand the words.

, Singing and doing hand games with your baby is also incredibly beneficial for their speech development. Involve them with action songs such as “Row, Row Your Boat” and “Patty Cake”. As your child associates words with actions, they will begin to communicate even if they can’t yet speak.


For example, if you do a hand game that involves a waving motion along with the word “hello”, your baby may soon be able to wave to communicate hello without actually saying the word.
It may take a while for the movement association to grow, but the movement and song will help your baby’s brain development in multiple ways.

, Learning to talk is difficult. Reward any progress your baby makes, and resist the urge to correct them when they mispronounce something.


For example, when your baby calls a dog a “da”, respond with a positive affirmation and the correct word, such as “Yes, that is a dog”. This will help your child learn the right word but won’t scare them into being afraid to try to talk.
Any sounds or noise is progress—don’t expect your child to be able to talk overnight, but encourage them every day as they explore the world around them.

, Participating in speech-building activities helps a baby learn to speak, but it doesn’t guarantee that it will happen. Some children have a more difficult time learning new words or making the appropriate sounds.


When this happens, continue working with your child and be patient as they learn. If your baby or toddler is frustrated that they can’t express themselves, visit a speech therapist for professional help.
Your pediatrician or a speech professional can give guidance on how to best handle the individual situation.

Use props and tools.",How to Encourage Babbling," Take the time to sit down and have engaged, deliberate conversations with your baby. Focus on your baby as he or she speaks, just as you would focus on any other conversational partner you might have.


Sit in front of your baby and look directly into his or her eyes as you speak. Alternatively, sit with your baby in your lap or carry your little one around as you converse.
Converse with your baby at every opportunity. When you change your little one's diaper or feed your baby, for instance, talk through the activity.
Conversations with your baby will likely consist of both babbles and ""real"" speech. If you don't know what to say, say anything. Tell your baby about your plans or ask rhetorical questions. Your baby may not understand the words, but he or she will learn how to respond to different inflections and intonations.;
, When your baby begins to babble, repeat his or her babbles. Each “ba-ba-ba” your baby makes should be followed with a “ba-ba-ba” of your own.


Repeating after your baby's babbles will let your little one know that you are giving him or her your undivided attention. Since your baby wants your attention, he or she is likely to babble more often in an effort to keep it.
Similarly, you can respond to your baby's babbles with unrelated expressions that let your baby know you're listening. After a string of babble, you could excitedly respond with ""I see!"" or ""Really!""

, After your baby finishes his or her own babbles, introduce similar sounding babbles. For instance, after repeating your baby's “ba-ba-ba,” follow by saying something like “bo-bo-bo” or “ma-ma-ma.”


You could also follow up your baby's babbles with simple words that contain the same sound as the babble your baby just made. For example, if your baby says, ""bah,"" you could respond with ""bah-bah-ball."" If your baby says ""dah,"" you could reply with ""dah-dah-dog."", Whether you are repeating babbles or using real words, you should be slow and deliberate as you speak to your baby. Your baby will begin to understand your speech before mastering speech of his or her own. Simplifying your own speech will make the learning process easier and encourage your baby to keep vocalizing.


Some studies suggest that babies learn to babble partially because they engage in lip-reading as they watch you speak. By slowing down your words and forming them deliberately, you allow your baby a greater opportunity to observe the movements of your mouth and repeat them., When your baby babbles, demonstrate excitement and happiness. Reacting positively to your baby's babbles will let your child know that babbling is a good thing and something that should be repeated more often.


Aside from using a positive tone of voice, you should also speak praise phrases, like ""Good job!""
Nonverbal communication is also important. Smile, laugh, clap your hands, and wave. Both verbal and nonverbal expressions of excitement are necessary if you want to show your baby that babbling is a positive thing., Talk to your baby as often as possible, even when you are not engaged in an active conversation with him or her. Babies have a tendency to mimic, and simply listening to your voice on a regular basis can encourage them to use their own voice more often.


Talking encourages both receptive and expressive language. Receptive language is the ability to understand speech, and expressive language is the ability to make speech.Talk to yourself and talk to your baby as you go about your everyday tasks. When you wash the dishes, talk about the chore and the different dishes you wash as you handle them. Even if your baby is looking elsewhere, your little one is still listening as long as he or she is awake.

, As you speak throughout the day, change the way you speak by varying the volume and pitch. A change in your voice will grab your baby's attention and pique further interest in the vocalization process.


Your baby will likely get used to the sound of your voice. Suddenly speaking in a different voice will usually cause your little one to refocus his or her attention on you in an effort to understand how that different sound is being made.
This works especially well if you speak in a “silly” voice. No matter how you change your tone, though, keep it positive.

, Even though your baby is only babbling now, it is still a good idea to begin instructing your baby in simple terms. Provide instructions that encourage your baby to interact with his or her world. For instance, try teaching your baby something like “kiss mama” or “hug daddy.”


When you give your baby instructions, follow through by showing him or her what those instructions mean. Say ""bounce ball"" and bounce the ball. Your baby may not be able to perform the action immediately, but once your little one gains the ability to do so, he or she will be thrilled to both do the action and know what that action is.

, When you speak to your baby, place emphasis on certain words you want to highlight by saying them more deliberately, clearly, and loudly. Emphasizing a single word within a string of several words will help your baby comprehend those words sooner.


When choosing a word to emphasize, pick an object rather than an action or descriptive term. Language has more meaning at this age when it is related to a tangible object.

, You can sing classic children's songs like “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” or “Bingo,” but you can also sing by simply speaking to your baby in a sing-song voice on occasion. Most babies enjoy the sound of singing and will attempt to babble and sing back.


You don't need to limit yourself to kids' songs, either. Singing your own favorites can be just as effective.
Singing to your baby presents language in a manner that differs from basic speech. This variation can help further your baby's understanding of language and may boost development.
It can also be helpful to pick one song to use whenever you need to comfort your baby. After a few repetitions, your baby will learn to calm down as soon as the song starts. This also teaches your baby that speaking and singing are positive behaviors.

, Buy children's books and read them to your baby on a frequent basis. Your little one may not understand everything yet, but the gears in your baby's head will start to turn. The auditory aspect of this activity will encourage your baby to babble, while the visual aspect could encourage your child to take more of an interest in reading later in life.


Make sure that you choose books aimed at your baby's age. In this stage, the best books are picture books with bright colors and a lot of contrast. The words should be simple and easy to understand.
Reading picture books to your baby also creates a cognitive link between the 3D and 2D world since you are teaching your baby to associate real objects with pictures of those objects.

, Babies are naturally curious about the world around them. Label parts of your baby's world by pointing at them and repeating that object's name. Doing this can help your child become more interested in repeating those names, which can encourage your baby to further his or her babbling skills.


A good labeling activity to begin with is the labeling of body parts. Point to your baby's nose and state, ""nose."" Point to your baby's hand and state, ""hand."" Most babies are naturally curious about their own bodies, and describing the body will encourage your baby to babble in imitation of your descriptions.
You can also name people, like ""Mama,"" ""Daddy,"" ""Grandma,"" and ""Grandpa.""
If you have pets, label the pets, as well. When starting out, label the pet by type rather than individual name, e.g., ""dog"" instead of ""Spot.""
Any object that is part of your baby's usual environment can work, especially if your baby is already looking at it. You can label anything from ""tree"" to ""ball.""

, Use your imagination to come up with a story and tell it to your baby. Storytelling naturally requires you to use different intonations and expressions, and the excitement in your voice can get your baby curious enough to repeat after you in babble form.


Mix things up by telling a simple story one day and an elaborate one the next. The more you vary your stories, the more engaged your baby will become.

, When your baby is only just starting to babble, try lightly patting his her or her mouth each time your baby makes a certain babble sound. Later on, lightly pat your baby's mouth before he or she starts to babble. Oftentimes, a baby will connect your action with the babbling activity from earlier and may repeat the earlier babble as you pat his or her mouth.


Your baby may even begin moving his or her mouth or repeating the same babble sounds when you stop patting to encourage you to start up again.
This activity can be used with any baby learning to babble, but it can be especially helpful if your baby struggles with strength in his or her facial muscles., Engaging your baby's visual sense while you work on your little one's verbal abilities can enhance the development of both.


Some tools can be used to help your baby learn the names of different objects. For instance, you could tell your baby a story about a cat and use a cat puppet as you speak.
Other tools will simply make the act of speaking more interesting to your baby. For instance, a baby might see you speak on your own phone, then babble into a toy telephone as a way of mimicking your actions.

Interact with your baby.,
Change positions often.,
End each session whenever your baby decides.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Sit Up1," “Tummy-time” is an important opportunity for your baby to play on the ground and to strengthen muscles in the neck, arms, trunk, and head. It will give your child the skills that should eventually lead to turning over, crawling, and sitting up. Just make sure that tummy-time is always when the child is awake and supervised.First off, spread a blanket, towel, or mat on the floor so that your baby has someplace comfortable to lie. You might also have tummy-time on your chest or stomach when you’re lying down.;
, Next, put your baby on the blanket or towel on his tummy. You can also give extra support with a rolled up towel. Just place this under the baby’s upper chest so that the child’s arms hang over the roll – and be sure the chin is also over it, so that his airway isn’t blocked.Your baby might not like being on the tummy at first. Start out with sessions that only last three to five minutes. You can work up gradually to 45 minutes to 60 minutes per day, spread out depending on your baby’s needs.

, Tummy-time is about encouraging your baby to move, look around, push up, and shift their body around to build up strength. Interact with and try to engage your child’s attention. Encourage your baby to lift their head, react to you, reach, and ultimately move and roll.Try to make and keep eye contact, encouraging your baby to look and you and interact. Consider singing, cooing, or humming, as well.
Bring in toys and physical objects, too, to motivate the child to look and reach. You might try hanging a toy overhead, for example, so that the baby will try to look up and strengthen the neck muscles – babies need to be able to support their heads in order to sit up.
You can also position a small mirror in front of your baby’s head. Chances are that the child will be intrigued by its own image and want to look up at it.

, Your baby will need to build up muscles and different motor skills before starting to sit up. Change position frequently to encourage this, putting the child on their back and side as well as on the tummy. Again, though, make sure to supervise.Try putting your baby on the side for tummy-time. Use a blanket with your hand or rolled up towel to support your baby’s back. The child’s arms should be in front and the knees and hips bent for comfort.Be sure to switch from side to side and back to the tummy so that your baby is able to use different muscle groups. This will help the muscles develop equally.

, There will plenty of signs that your baby has had enough of tummy-time. Don’t push for extra time. You can always try again later or the next day. Make sure to wrap things up when the child gets restless.


Your baby will let you know when enough is enough by becoming fussy, crying, or laying down. Take this to mean that the child is tired.
Pick up your baby or turn the child onto the back when tummy-time is over. Also, always be sure to watch your baby during tummy-time sessions. While babies can lie on their tummies when awake and under supervision, they should be on their back for sleeping in order to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

Select sleepwear that is appropriate for the season.,
Choose sleepwear made from natural fibers.,
Feel your baby’s skin.,
Dress your baby in fitted sleepwear.,
Layer your baby's sleepwear.,
Determine if you need to add a cap and booties.",How to Dress Baby for Sleep1," Overdressing babies in winter is a common problem, while underdressing babies in the summer is a problem. In the spring and fall, rapid temperature changes can also lead to over and under dressing.



Try not to overdress your baby in the winter. If you have a newborn and you are still swaddling, then you can dress your baby in a cotton long-sleeved onesie with footies or socks under the swaddling. For babies past swaddling age, a heavier weight cotton long-sleeved onesie with footies or socks is a good choice.Provide enough clothing in the summer. For newborns, swaddling in a lightweight cotton blanket should be enough, but feel your baby’s skin to be sure. Your baby can wear a lightweight short-sleeved onesie under the swaddling if it's not too hot. Babies past swaddling age can wear a short-sleeved one-piece pajama.

Check your baby's skin often in spring and fall. In the spring and fall, rapid temperature changes mean that you will have to check your baby’s skin often to see if he or she is comfortable. Try dressing your baby in layers in spring and fall so that you can add and remove layers as needed.;
, Natural fibers are more effective in hot and cold weather. In hot weather, natural fibers can absorb sweat better and pull moisture away from your baby’s body. In cold weather, natural fibers provide more effective insulation and they are easier to layer.Natural fibers also collect less static than synthetic fibers. Some good natural fibers to choose for your baby include:


Cotton
Silk
Wool
Cashmere
Hemp
Linen

, Your baby’s skin is a good indicator of how cold or how warm he or she is. To see if your baby is too warm or too cold, touch your baby’s skin in a few different places. Your baby’s skin should be at a comfortable temperature.


For example, if your baby’s toes feel cold, then your baby may be too cold and you may want to put on some booties. If your baby’s skin feels too warm under her clothes, then she may be too warm and you should remove a layer of clothing.
You can check any area of baby’s skin, but the back of the neck is a great indicator. The back of your baby’s neck should be a bit cool to the touch and there should be no sweat. Sweating can be a sign of overheating in babies., You can start dressing your baby in fitted sleepwear after your baby is about three months old or sooner if you are not swaddling your baby. Choose one-piece sleepwear and avoid any sleepwear that has ribbons, ties, strings, or anything else that your baby might get tangled up in., Dressing your baby in layers makes it easier to adjust your baby’s sleepwear as needed. For example, you can remove a layer if your baby feels too warm or add a layer if your baby feels too cold.


Add one more layer than you would wear. Babies are often colder than adults, so a good rule of thumb is to dress your baby in one more layer than you would wear.For example, if you are comfortable in a t-shirt, then your baby may need a t-shirt and a lightweight long-sleeve shirt as well.

, Babies lose a lot of heat from their heads and feet. Check the skin on your baby’s scalp and feet. If this skin feels cooler than other parts of the body, then add a cap or some socks.


Make sure the cap cannot come down and cover the mouth or nose so that it won't obstruct the baby's breathing.
Check your baby’s head and feet often. If your baby’s scalp gets sweaty, take off the cap. If your baby’s feet get sweaty, then remove the socks.

Put your baby in a sitting position.,
Position your baby in corners.,
Use your own legs for support.,
Give your baby extra support.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Sit Up2," Another way to help your baby to sit up is to help with building up balance. By about four months old, most babies start to hold their heads steady. You can now encourage your baby with sitting positions, so that the child gets used being upright and develops balance.Try putting your baby in a Bumbo chair or upright on your lap, with support. At first the child will be a bit wobbly and may only be able to hold herself upright for one or two seconds.
Make sure to watch the child closely. If you’re practicing on the ground, lay down blankets in case of tumbles.
You might also put your baby upright with support in the stroller when you go out for walks. Do this to try to stimulate interest in sitting up and point out interesting things, like dogs, other children, or cars., Balance is something that your baby needs to sit up and hold steady, but it takes time to develop this neuromuscular skill. Corners are a great place for your baby to do this, as they give the chance to practice while offering natural support.Make use of the corners of couches, chairs, or even rooms for balance practice. Surround the child with one or two pillows for support, too, if steadiness is still an issue.

, Another way to give your baby extra support and balance while sitting up is to position the child between your legs. Once crossed, your legs and lap form a perfect spot for your baby to sit with support.


First, sit down on the ground and cross your legs so that they are both folded underneath you.
Then, place your baby in the center of your lap between your calf muscles and hamstrings. Your thighs will give the child support on both sides, while your trunk will prop the baby upright.

, At first, your child will need extra help in sitting up. Give support while she learns the ropes and starts to sit up under her own power. You’ll need to be nearby at all times and can also use items to make the transition easier.At first, your baby will need to hold up their body weight by placing their arms out in front. This is the “tripod” position and helps to build up the core muscles. Until then, be sure that your child is on a soft surface like carpeting, a blanket, towel, or mat.
You can also consider using things to prop the baby up and encourage the needed muscle growth and balance. Regular pillows, rolled up towels, ExerSaucers, Boppy pillows, Bumbo chairs, or Doorway Jumpers can all work.

Play games sitting up.,
Use a cardboard box.,
Give your baby a lift.,
Pull your baby upright.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Sit Up3," Another way to practice sitting on a regular basis is to play games with your baby. For example, sit your child on the floor on your lap so that you are supporting her sides and back. Make sure that the hands are free. The idea is to encourage the child to play while holding herself up.Use colorful toys to entice the child. Place toys out front so that your baby will try to grab them. While the child will first need both hands to keep steady, in time she will be able to free one hand and then both to play.
When your baby has free hands, start to offer more toys to play with. This way the child learns to sit properly while focusing on the toys.

, You might also try using a cardboard box. This is another good technique for practicing and encouraging sitting. Just find a small, open box and place your baby inside – with pillows for support at first – and make sure the length of the box is slightly more than the width.Place your baby inside in an upright position. The box provides a support structure and will help to hold the child upright. You can then provide toys to play with inside of the box.
You might also position a dowel, ruler, or short broom handle over the box with some toys attached. The presence of toys in the box and overhead should give your baby a strong incentive to sit upright.

, Be hands-on in encouraging your baby to sit upright, too. Help the child get used to sitting upright and to build the muscles to do so even more. You can go about this in a few ways, but in all cases the baby will need a little lift from you.Lay your baby on the back, for starters. Then, gently hold both hands and pull the child up from the back to a sitting position.
Try using a small mirror to entice the child to sit up. While your baby is lying on their back, hold the mirror just a little too high to see – and then assist the child to sit up for a look.

, Still another muscle-building exercise is to prop your baby up by holding your hands under the child’s arms. While your baby won’t be able to stand upright yet, this position will build up more strength and balance.Put your hands under your baby’s arms and gently lift up. Hold the baby so that you are supporting most of the weight but the child’s feet are on the floor.
Let the child bear a small amount of weight. You will need to do most of the work, but that little weight will help the child develop core muscles and more balance.

Use a lightweight blanket if necessary.,
Consider swaddling your baby.,
Keep the room temperature at about 65°F (18.3°C).A room temperature of about 65°F (18.3°C) is ideal for sleep, so try to keep your baby’s room in this range.",How to Dress Baby for Sleep2," If the weather is warm, then a blanket may not be necessary, but lightweight blankets are best. Select a lightweight blanket that is made from natural materials, such as cotton, wool, silk, or hemp. Heavy, fluffy blankets are a suffocation hazard for babies, so it is best to avoid these.


Always tuck your baby in if you use a blanket. Make sure that the blanket comes up to your baby’s chest (under your baby’s armpits) and tuck it into the sides and bottom of the mattress.Instead of a blanket, try putting your baby in a sleep sack. This reduces the risk of smothering while keeping your baby comfortable.

, Swaddling is when you wrap your baby in a swaddling blanket so that only your baby’s head is exposed. Swaddling can help a newborn baby sleep better and longer because it simulates a mother’s womb. You can swaddle your baby until she is three to four months old, or longer in some cases. To determine when to stop swaddling your baby, swaddle your baby and leave one arm sticking out. If your baby sleeps well with one arm out, then you may not need to swaddle anymore.To swaddle your baby, lay a lightweight, natural fiber blanket down so that it looks like a diamond from your perspective. Fold down the corner of the blanket that is furthest away from you.
Then, lay your baby in the center of the blanket with her head resting on the folded corner.
Pull one side of the blanket over your baby’s chest.
Then, fold up the bottom of the blanket over your baby’s feet, tucking it up over your baby’s shoulder.
Last, fold over the other side of the blanket across the baby’s chest. Make sure that the swaddling is snug, but not tight.

, If you have a thermostat, then set it for 65°F (18.3°C).


If you do not have a thermostat, consider getting an indoor thermometer to put in your baby’s room. This can help you see if you need to close or open a window, turn up the heat, or turn on the air conditioning.
Keep your baby away from air conditioning vents or drafty windows.

Layer it up during the wintertime.,
Protect your baby’s delicate skin from the sun during the hot summer months.",How to Dress an Infant1," When adults go out in the winter, they may wear an undershirt, a sweater, a jacket, a scarf and a hat. It is important to know that your baby needs the same amount of layers as well.


Make sure that your baby has a warm hat that fits his head snugly but is not too tight. A proper fitting jacket is also important. If the baby’s head and arms are warm, that will help warm up the rest of his body.
Invest in a good pair of gloves or mittens for your baby to keep his hands warm.
Carry a warm blanket with you so if you are transporting your baby between the outdoors and into an indoor setting, you can cover him with the blanket to block the cold wind.;
, Summer can be a tricky time for dressing infants because they can overheat very quickly. Heat and extreme humidity can cause them to develop a heat rash or heat stroke quickly.


Make sure to keep a sun hat handy to keep the sun off your baby’s face.
Protect his sensitive skin with a good sunscreen approved for infants.
During the summer months, it is important to dress your baby in clothing that will allow his skin to breathe. Make sure that you are not dressing him in any constricting garments or heavy fabrics. Instead, choose clothing that is loose-fitting and lightweight. Selecting lighter colors will also help to block some of the heat.

Dress the baby as you would dress yourself.,
Dress in short sleeves if they will be out of direct sunlight.,
Cover their arms and legs if direct sunlight cannot be avoided.,
Carry an extra layer of clothing with you.,
Skip the socks when you go outside.,
Put on a onesie for bed.",How to Dress a Baby for Summer1," The general rule is to dress your baby the same way you are dressed. As you adjust your clothing throughout the day, adjust your baby’s clothing in a similar manner.If you are wearing a t-shirt and shorts, your baby can wear the same.
If you add a hoodie on a cooler day, don’t forget to add one for your baby.
Check the weather forecast everyday to make sure that both you and your baby are dressed appropriately.;
, Short sleeves are best for activities where the baby will not be outside for long periods of time, such as playing inside or running errands, or if they will be in an outdoor, shaded area., In general, your baby should be kept in the shade, but if you cannot avoid sunlight, make sure that the baby's arms and legs are protected. Long sleeves and pants will help.Long sleeves can also protect your baby from mosquitoes. If you will be by a lake or pool, you may want to consider covering up their arms and legs.
If you do decide to put your baby in short sleeves while you are outside, you must keep the baby out of the sun. Stay in the shade until you go inside.

, Most babies will be fine in a basic onesie and shorts or a skirt. To avoid overheating, keep your baby in a single layer most of the time. Pack an extra layer, such as a button-up shirt or sweater, in the diaper bag just in case you need them.For example, the baby may wear short sleeves at home, but if you go to the grocery store, they may need a light sweater.
Avoid any extra layers if the temperature is above 75 °F (24 °C)., If you will be playing outside, leave the socks off of your baby’s feet. That said, socks can be a great way of keeping a baby’s feet warm if they are inside an air-conditioned room.While babies do not need to wear shoes until they are able to walk, they should have something covering their feet when they are outside. Baby shoes, sandals, and other footwear may be better than socks in this case.

, Even at night, overheating can be a problem. Instead of heavy PJs, dress your baby in a onesie and diaper. If you have an air-conditioned home or the baby’s room tends to be cooler, dress them in a heavier sleeper or swaddle them in a muslin blanket.Avoid fleece nightclothes in the summer.
Never add loose blankets to your baby’s crib to keep them warm, as they can be a suffocation hazard.

"
"
Invest in 8 to 10 good quality, one-piece undershirts, or 'onesies'.,
Stock up on one piece outfits that have either snaps or zippers up the middle.,
Purchase a few pairs of socks and newborn caps to keep baby’s head and feet warm when indoors.",How to Dress an Infant2," These all-in-one t-shirts are placed over the infant’s head and close with snaps at the bottom. They easily unsnap, allowing for easy diaper changes.

, These one piece garments are practical and usually very affordable. They come in a variety of cute designs and make diaper changes very easy.

, Even on warmer days, baby’s tiny feet can become cold because an infant does not yet have good circulation.


On days when your baby is not wearing a one piece outfit that cover the feet, a pair of socks may be all that is needed to keep his feet warm rather than using a blanket.
Newborn caps are lightweight and will keep baby’s head warm on cooler days without causing him to overheat.

"

Dress your infant in clothing that will keep him warm even without the use of a blanket.,
Avoid covering your baby’s head when he is sleeping.,
Invest in a sleeping bag that is made especially for infants at bedtime.,
Try swaddling your baby in a wrap for bedtime.",How to Dress an Infant3," Blankets are not recommended for infants as they are a suffocation hazard and are believed to be a risk factor for developing SIDS. Additionally, your baby could roll over during the night and get out from underneath their warm blanket, leaving their bodies exposed to the cool air. If you dress him in warm clothing with a couple of layers, you can take a layer off to adjust to the changing temperature if the baby becomes too hot.

, This is a serious suffocation hazard and can also cause him to overheat very quickly. Certain hats or bonnets can cause your baby to choke so it is best to avoid all head coverings when placing the infant down to sleep.

, If the sleeping bag is the correct size, it can help protect your baby from SIDS by keeping his head and face uncovered. The sleeping bag can also keep your baby from rolling over and ending up on his stomach while he is sleeping. Be sure to dress your baby appropriately for sleeping in the sleeping bag. You may not need as many layers of clothing because the sleeping bag will keep the warmth in., Wraps are designed to swaddle your infant in the same way you would swaddle him with a blanket, keeping his arms held tightly against his body. These specially designed wraps provide the same comfort as a swaddling blanket without the dangers associated with blanket use at bedtime. Using a wrap can help get your baby settled for bedtime and can also make sure he is safely sleeping on his back. As long as you keep the wrap away from his head, it can make your baby feel very comfortable while keeping him very warm."

Choose lightweight fabrics to prevent overheating.,
Find light-colored clothing.,
Use a lightweight baby carrier or sling.",How to Dress a Baby for Summer2," Buy loose-fitting clothing made out of a lightweight, breathable fabric. Look for fabrics made from natural fibers, like cotton or muslin, instead of synthetic fabrics, like polyester and rayon.You might want to use a size larger than they normally wear so air can move through their clothing.
Fabric with a tight weave offers better protection against the sun and heat than loosely woven fabric., Light-colored clothing will help make your baby feel cooler in the summer sun. This is because light colors do not retain heat as long as dark colors. Pastels and pale tones work best., Baby slings can be very hot so choose one that is made from a lightweight fabric, like nylon instead of denim. There are also carriers that are designed to make your baby feel cooler, such as the ERGObaby carrier or the BabyBjorn Air."
"
Pick out a sun hat for your child.,
Buy UV-protected clothing to avoid sunburn.,
Put a pair of sunglasses on your baby.,
Stay in the shade even if your baby is dressed well.,
Monitor your child for signs of dehydration or overheating.",How to Dress a Baby for Summer3," A hat with a wide brim 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) wide will keep the sun out of your baby’s eyes and off their face. Many newborn baby hats come with a strap that attaches under the chin, which can help keep the hat on your baby’s head.


Keep an eye on the strap as your baby moves to make sure it isn’t too tight or cutting off circulation.

, These UV-protected clothes can be a little pricy, but they are great if you will be spending long periods of time outside. You can buy shirts, bathing suits, hats, and rash guards for your baby with this protection., Pick out a pair that covers your baby’s eyes entirely. Make sure that they protect from UV rays. Look for a sticker that says UV400.


While your baby might not want to wear sunglasses, letting them pick out the sunglasses (if they are capable) may help convince them to wear the glasses. However, if your baby outright refuses to do this, don’t force them.

, While clothing will offer some protection against the sun, you should still keep your baby in a shaded area. Avoid direct sunlight as much as possible to protect them from both the heat and the sun.Babies younger than six months old shouldn’t wear sunscreen. If you can’t avoid direct sunlight, however, a very light coat of baby sunscreen is acceptable.
You can buy sunshades for strollers and prams if yours doesn’t already have one.

, If your child is dehydrated or overheated, visit a doctor immediately. Watch for the following symptoms:Dry lips and coated-looking tongue and mouth
Skin that is red or hot to the touch
A sunken fontanelle, which is the soft spot on the top of your baby's head
Urinating less than usual
Sunken and dark eyes
Irritable and tearless crying
Dark yellow urine
Exhaustion and drowsiness
Rapid breathing
Cold or blotchy hands and feet
Vomiting and diarrhea

Monitor your baby’s development.,
Lay out a blanket or towel on the carpet.,
Put your baby on the blanket, tummy-down.,
Engage your baby’s attention.,
Try tummy-time on the side.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Roll1," Exactly when your baby is ready to roll over will depend on a lot of things. Some babies develop earlier, while others take a bit longer. In general, though, babies usually start to roll over at about four months and will show some physical signs that they’re ready. Watch for these.By this time, your baby should have more developed neck muscles and be able to support his or her head to look up.
Babies often start to push themselves up from the tummy to the shoulder at this age. Also, look for rocking back and forth when you’ve put your baby down on his back.;
, “Tummy-time” is exercise that will help your baby strengthen the muscles in the head, neck, arms, and abdomen. Putting babies on their tummies while awake and supervised will let them practice the skills they need to turn over. It also promotes behavior that will eventually lead to crawling, reaching, and playing.Babies can usually start tummy time when they are one or two months old, though some parents wait a while longer. Just talk to your doctor to make sure that it’s OK.Babies under one or two months can spend a few minutes on their tummy on mom or dad's stomach, chest, or lap.
First of all, lay out a towel, blanket, or soft mat on the ground to give your baby a comfy area. You can also hold tummy-time on your stomach or chest while you’re awake and lying down.
Always make sure to watch your baby during tummy-time, too. It’s usually fine for your baby to lie tummy-down while awake and supervised, but babies should be on their backs while sleeping to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)

, Gently place your baby tummy-down on the blanket or matted area. Some doctors also suggest using a rolled up towel for extra support. Put this under your baby’s chest with the arms over the roll. Just make sure that your child’s chin is also past the roll so as not to obstruct his breathing.Start out with sessions lasting three to five minutes and work up gradually to between 45 minutes to 60 minutes per day. You can spread this time out, depending on your baby’s development and needs.
Pay close attention to when your baby gets tired or fussy and end the session, such as if the child starts to cry or lays down on the mat.

, Now that you’ve got your baby on the ground, it’s time to start tummy-time. Ideally, your baby should be encouraged during this time to lift up the head, react, reach, and eventually move and roll in response to your voice.Getting down on the floor with your baby is another great way to encourage tummy-time.


May eye contact and talk, for instance, so that your baby is motivated to look at you and participate. You can also sing and coo.
Use items to encourage the child to look at you and to reach, as well. For instance, try dangling a toy to have the infant lift his or her head up to look – this will strengthen the arm and neck muscles.
You might also put a small plastic mirror in front of your baby. This way, the child will be encouraged to look up at himself.

, You can also do these exercises with your baby positioned on the side. Just place the child on the blanket on one side, with your hand or a rolled up blanket supporting the back. Both the infant’s arms should be in front and the hips and knees slightly bent for comfort. This alternative position can make it easier to reach and play.Make sure to switch sides so that your baby uses both sides of his body. This will ensure that muscles are strengthened equally.

"
"
Entice your child with a toy.,
Lie down next to the baby.,
Do playtime on the back.,
Keep interacting.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Roll2," Over time, your baby will build up all the muscles that are needed to turn over. By about four months old, the child should be able to hold his head up and raise himself to the elbows during tummy-time. You may also notice some rocking back and forth on the stomach, kicking the legs, and moving the arms as though swimming.All of this means that your baby is nearly there. You can encourage the next steps by using toys. For example, wiggle a toy next to your baby on either side. Try to draw attention to the toy so that she rolls toward it.
If the toy is in your baby’s line of vision, make sure that it is just out of reach so that the child will try to grab and reach for it.
Try a variety of colorful toys or toys that make noise, as well. The idea is to use something attention-grabbing that will catch the baby’s interest – and that she’ll want to see or grab. For example, you might take a colorful rattle and shake it off to one side, slightly out of the child’s range of vision.

, You can also try to be the bait yourself instead of a toy! Lie down to one side of your baby, just out of reach, to encourage the child to roll over toward you and close the distance. This, too, can induce a first roll-over.Continue to talk, coo, or sing to your baby while you’re lying down. The idea is to be slightly out of reach or sight, so that the child wants to see you or move toward you.

, Don’t just limit your play to tummy-time. Let your baby play on his or her back, too, especially to get used to “rounded” positions – that is, pulling in and extending her feet and legs. This tucking movement is important in the motor skills that help to turn over, too.Achieving the rounded position is fairly easy, since most babies like to be on their backs. It will also be easier for you to interact with your baby and to keep the child’s attention while she is lying down.
Do playtime on the back on a soft surface. You can use the same blanket as for tummy-time, but also your lap or any flat surface.
If you’d like, encourage your baby to roll by gently and slowly rocking her back and forth on the back (or tummy), helping the child shift weight from side to side. You might do this along with a song.

, Rolling over for the first time might come as a surprise to your baby and to you. It can be a somewhat disturbing feeling for a baby, too. Keep encouraging, interacting, and applauding your baby as the child reaches this milestone.Your attention will keep your baby engaged and is key. Sing, talk, move, and laugh while you play. Show your encouragement by smiling, too!

Help your baby lift and cross his or her legs.,
Roll your baby’s weight to the side when putting her down.,
Roll your baby gently down an incline.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Roll3," There are a number of hands-on methods that you can use to encourage – and teach – your baby in the motions of rolling over. You can try these on their own or in addition to play. One is to guide your baby in lifting and crossing the legs.First, lay your baby on the back on the tummy-time blanket and gently lift one leg. While holding the other leg down, move the raised leg in slow circles. Switch legs and do it again.
Next, with your baby still on his or her back, gently raise one leg again, cross it over the other, and roll the child in one movement onto the tummy.
Babies are hardwired at birth to keep their bodies aligned and only start to move by “segment” at around 4 to 5 months. This exercise is encouraging the movement your baby needs to roll over at the hips., This method is easy to do. It’s also something that you can incorporate into your daily routines like changing and putting your baby down to rest. So, you can practice this move many times per day.All you need to do is sit your baby on the bottom and roll her onto the side when laying her down. Babies, as said, are hardwired to keep their bodies aligned and will try to keep their heads over the rest of their body.
Just reverse the motions when you pick your baby up again. This will help your baby strengthen the muscles in the sides of the neck muscles and also get used to pushing against the floor on the way down.

, One final method is to guide and encourage your baby through rolling over with the gentle aid of gravity. For this, you’ll need a raised surface on a very slight incline. Be careful and make sure that the surface is soft, not too high, and not too steep.Take a surface like a small mattress and place it on the ground. To get the proper incline, place a small pillow under one end of the mattress.
Start from the top and (very gently) help your baby roll over. Repeat this two or three times down the incline and then, once you’ve reached the bottom, do it from the top and roll her on the other side of her body.
In all cases, keep smiling, talking, encouraging, and interacting with your baby while you help the child turn over.

Cover your baby's extremities.,
Watch for warning signs that your child is cold.",How to Dress a Baby," This can be especially helpful if your child likes to wiggle about while you're dressing her. Be sure you have laid out her clothing and that it's well within reach to make the dressing process less of a hassle.


Clothing that uses snaps to fasten the garment in place can make the dressing process much easier on you.;
, With very young infants, you will need to provide additional head support while dressing. This can be done by holding her in your lap while putting on clothing and allowing your legs to support her head., Sleeves easily tangle around your young one's limbs. This can make the everyday task of dressing your child frustrating, but you should avoid pushing her tiny arms and legs into sleeves, as this can cause her to bend or twist a limb painfully.


Put your hand through the sleeve from the outside, take your baby's limb gently in your hand, and pull it through., Young infants have little muscular control and require your support, particularly for the neck and head. When trying to fit her head into an article of clothing, stretch the neckline to give her as much clearance as she needs.


You should always try to pull clothing onto and off of your baby quickly, as blocked breathing can cause your little one to panic., Remove your baby's limbs from each sleeve individually while supporting her by the back of the head. Once the limbs are free, stretch the neckline wide enough so that it clears her chin and face. Then, simply lift the garment off., Cotton is lightweight and durable, which is perfect for the wear and tear associated with young children.Some other great natural options you might want to consider for your child:

Soft wool., Some dyes and fabric treatments are quite toxic, and your young one's developing body might be vulnerable to these.You may need to look up clothing information before purchasing it. This will help you to determine whether or not the dyes and appliques used on it are nontoxic.


You can lessen the risk of exposing your child to dangerous chemicals by buying clothing from secondhand stores and dressing her in hand-me-downs. Repeated washings can diminish the chemicals in the clothingAvoid wrinkle free, anti-microbial, and stain resistant labels.Wash new clothing multiple times to remove residual and manufacturing chemicals., Young children will need to have diapers changed frequently, and snaps in the crotch of your baby's one-piece will make this task much easier. Zippers or snaps down the front can also aid you in your child dressing responsibilities., As cute as you might think ribbons, knotted strings, and fabric accents will look on your baby, rough play or daily wear can tear these loose. If this occurs, your child could put a ribbon in her mouth and choke on it., In a heat wave, your baby can easily become overheated and fussy. Choose lightweight, loose fitting clothing that breathes to help prevent this. You should also avoid dark colors, as these absorb heat and can contribute to your child's overheating., An umbrella or tree can keep the sun's damaging rays from leaving your child sunburned, but sometimes these options aren't available. A wide brimmed hat can keep your baby from getting too much sun while allowing her to play outside with her friends., Your baby might be different, but many young children prefer to take off shoes and socks in warm weather. The small size of these garments means that they can be easily misplaced. Having an extra pair on hand can be a lifesaver when play time's over and you're ready to redress your child and go., While you might think that your child's clothing should keep her sufficiently guarded against the sun, but an average cotton t-shirt is only rated at an SPF of five!Make sure she is wearing sunscreen before going out to play in warm, sunny weather.

, The heat of the day can combine with your body heat to make the enclosed space of a baby carrier uncomfortable for your little one. Carriers made from nylon, or other light fabrics, can disperse this heat.If you notice that your child is looking more flushed than normal, she could potentially be overheating. Remove her from the carrier right away, and seek out a cooler location., It's generally a good idea to dress your baby in with the same number of layers you are wearing yourself.


You'll also want to bring along an extra sweater or blanket, just in case your child needs some additional warmth.
In exceptionally cold weather, you should opt for layers over a single ""super warm"" garment.

, Some doctors assert that many babies are overdressed, citing the custom of many northern European countries to allow children out in the cold without heavy bundling with no measurable negative impact as proof.Check your child regularly while you learn the most comfortable amount of layers for her in the cold. Every child is different, and some will require more bundling than others.Feel your baby's skin temperature to see if she's overheating or chilled., Your child could easily develop frostbite or frostnip on the head, face, ears, hands, and/or feet if she is not properly dressed for the cold.Frostbite is where the skin gets too cold and freezes, and can be very dangerous to your child's health. To prevent this from happening, be sure she is fully equipped with winter gear, like:


Hat
Mittens
Scarf
Winter boots/booties

, If your baby's skin is cold to the touch, a blueish color develops in the skin, or she is crying or complaining more than usual, your child might need a break from the cold. Spend some time indoors and think about adding a layer of clothing or a fresh, dry pair of gloves to her winter clothes."

You do not need to do unnatural activities or intensely focus on ""educational activities"" for a baby to thrive.;
, A baby needs a full belly, a dry diaper, a comfortable environment, and love for optimum growth.

, Give a ""play by play"" of what you're doing (making a cup of tea, changing a diaper, checking the mailbox. Indulge in baby talk; it's specifically designed to stimulate a baby. Read a book together.

, Sing nursery rhymes, TV jingles, your favorite songs.

, Classic games like ""Peek-A-Boo"", kissing the baby's tummy, rolling a ball back and forth on are great baby activities. Dance with the baby in your arms.

,, Babies love to move their bodies. Learn baby massage and baby yoga, which help calm, invigorate, and stimulate. But simply moving the baby in a way he or she likes (like clapping hands, rocking back and forth, ""So Big!"") is great exercise, and gently rubbing baby down with baby massage oil is great for tactile development.

, These tend to be a firm favorite with babies from newborn up to about 12 months. They mostly come in the form of comfortable, quilted or softly padded play mats, sometimes raised at the edges with a space in the middle for baby. They can consist of detachable, hanging parts for small babies to try to grasp. They tend to have parts that are crinkly, soft, scrunchy textures for baby to touch, squeeze and stroke. Some come with bright twinkling lights and bells and others make funny sounds, or musical sounds, and some even do both.

, Babies are fascinated by things adults take for granted: Cars zooming outside the window, fish tanks, trees blown by the wind, tumbling clothes in the dryer.

, Be sure the toy is appropriate for the baby. While a 4 month old may find a mirror fascinating, a 6 day old won't be able to see it clearly and a 12 month old might be bored by it. Usually educational toys have a developmental age range on the package as a guide. Be sure any toy is safe, appropriate, and clean.

, The more your repeat things like showing a baby how to scrunch up a ball, the quicker the connections between neurons are formed. Therefore, it naturally follows that the more positive interaction you give an infant or toddler, the more you are helping to stimulate young brains. This stimulation causes new connections to form neural pathways and strengthens existing ones. But once he or she acts bored, stop.

, Generally speaking, anything the baby thinks is fun is stimulating and educational. Don't worry if the baby is learning; if he or she is having a good time, he or she is learning something important.

, If the baby starts to fuss, cry, or act bored, it's time to stop. Over-stimulation, fatigue, or bodily needs will interfere with learning. If the baby is unhappy, it's time to move on to something else.

, The knowledge of a second language gives them many advantages and the best time to start is between 0 and 3 years as it is easier for your child to pick up unique sounds.

Research agencies.,
Beware of scams.,

Print the pictures you chose.,
Label the back of each photo.,
Send the photos and a short introduction letter to the agency.",How to Do a Baby Model Portfolio," There is no need to spend a fortune on having professional photos taken of your baby. Legitimate modeling agencies accept and encourage photos that you’ve taken yourself, since they know that babies grow and change all the time. Just be sure that the photos are high-quality, have good lighting, and show your baby clearly.Be sure to take the photos in color, not black and white.
Some agencies will only accept online submissions, so it is best to use a digital camera or your camera phone. That way, you can have both digital and print versions of your pictures.;
, When taking photos of your baby, you want to avoid using the flash. Flash can create harsh shadows. Instead, choose a well-lit part of your home or a lovely area outside in which to take the pictures., Agencies are drawn to pictures that show your child in a simple, natural state. It is best to dress your baby in just a diaper or a simple dress or T-shirt. Avoid dressing your baby in frilly clothing, hats, and jewelry. Remember that the key is to showcase your baby, not their outfits and accessories., Again, agencies prefer photos that aren’t busy or overly complicated. Take photos of your baby against a simple background, such as grass, tile, a hardwood floor, or a neutral-colored blanket. If you take the photos in a place that is visually busier, such as in the kitchen or at a park, be sure that the picture is focused on the baby.


You can also try a few pictures of your baby sitting on a bench or chair, depending on their age.

, Modeling agencies will want to see your baby’s full body and size to determine if they will be a good fit for what their client needs. You will choose the best ones before sending them to the agency.Be sure that the pictures show your baby's true size. This means don't crowd your baby with lots of blanket or cover them up.

, The modeling agency will want to see a clear, close-up photo of your baby’s face. Again, take a few so that you have some options to choose from later.Be sure to avoid pictures in which your baby is covered in food or sprinkles. As cute as those pictures may seem, the agency wants to see your baby’s full, clean face.If possible, try taking some photos of your baby looking happy, engaged, and exuberant., Baby modeling agencies want to see your baby’s spark. They want to see that your baby has a unique personality, so take photos that capture this as well as possible. Remember, there are many cute babies, so this picture is your chance to show what sets your baby apart. Getting a great character shot can take time and lots of takes, but it will be worth it when you capture the picture that will catch the agent’s eye.
Here are some ideas for this type of photo—try to photograph your baby as they are: laughing, smiling, pondering, embracing the camera, or making an expression of deep thought or wonderment.

, You will want to upload the photos to your computer so that you can view them on a larger screen, and then edit them if necessary. Once they are on your computer, you can start the process of reviewing them to see which ones to send.

, It may be tempting to send hundreds of pictures to be sure that the agency sees the full scope of your baby’s wonderfulness. However, you want to choose only a few photos—3 to 5—to submit. Sending too many will likely work against you, as the agent may be overwhelmed and move onto another candidate. Here are some tips for helping you narrow down the pictures:


Choose at least one photo from each of the categories mentioned above: a full-length photo, a photo of your baby's face, and a photo that shows your baby's personality.You want to show that your baby is good-natured and can handle being around others, so avoid photos that show your baby hysterically screaming or crying.Have at least one photo where your baby looks happy, lively, or joyful.
Ask others to choose between a few versions of the same shot to see which they think is best.
Don’t submit a photo that is blurry or too dark to see details.

, Now that you’ve chosen your photos, you may want to use Photoshop or another editing program to adjust the lighting and contrast. If you do this, just be sure that the photos still look natural, and that they realistically portray what your baby looks like. You wouldn't want your baby to be chosen for a shoot, only to be told that they aren’t a good fit once you arrive on set. Your baby is beautiful as is, so there is no need to make extreme edits., You want to be sure that the agency you’re considering is registered, reputable, and within a reasonable travel distance. You can search on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website to find agencies that are accredited by the BBB in your area. Check to see if the agency you're considering has placed models for legitimate companies in the past. This can help you determine whether or not it is a credible agency.You may also want to do an internet search of the company’s name, followed by words like “scam” or “rip off.”

, Sadly, there are many scams that occur in the baby modeling industry. When choosing what agencies to submit your photos to, be sure that you aren’t setting yourself up to be scammed. By looking for the following warning signs, you can keep yourself, your baby, and your wallet safe from being taken advantage of:The agency asks for money up front. If a company asks you for a fee before they will serve as your baby’s agent, they are very likely trying to scam you. Legitimate agencies will not charge you up front.
The agency guarantees you work or talks about making your baby famous. Baby modeling is a very competitive and small industry, so it is impossible for the agency to guarantee that your baby will have consistent, if any, work.
The agency says you must use a specific photographer.
The agency tells you that you need to “hurry up” or “commit now.”
The agency only accepts cash or a money order. Just like scams on Craigslist, when someone requires only cash or a money order, it is often a warning sign.

, Now that you've narrowed down a list of agencies, you will need to search each agency's website to see how they want you to submit your photos. Some agencies will want you to print the pictures of your baby and mail them in, while others may prefer an email or an online submission.

, If an agency requests that you send the photos via regular mail, there are many options for having your photos printed. You can have them printed at a store like Walgreens, CVS, or a Fedex Office Print shop; you can print them online through a well-reputed service like Shutterfly or Snapfish; or you can print them at home on photo paper.


The agency may specify what size they would like your pictures to be. If they don't, print your pictures at either 4""x6"", 5""x7"", or 8""x10"". Make sure not to exceed 8""x10""., On the back of each photo, write your contact details, as well as your baby’s clothing size, age, birthday, and measurements. This step is very important if you are sending the photos in the mail, as it will give the agency quick access to the information they need. Once you’ve done this, put the photos in an envelope. They are ready to send!

, Now that you’ve done your research and chosen a few reputable agencies in your area, you’re ready to send off your photos! Along with your selected images, type up a short letter of introduction. Keep this letter just a few sentences long, and include your contact information, as well as the baby’s clothing size, age, birthday, and measurements once again. If you are sending the submission in the mail, you should be able to find the address on the agency’s website.
If you are sending the submission via email, paste the introduction letter into the body of the email. Then, attach the images to the email.
If you are using an online submission feature, be sure the images are no larger than 2MB. There will likely be submission form fields for you to fill out with information about you and your baby.

Speak to your baby.,
Listen to your baby’s response.,
Repeat key words several times.,
Encourage more complex speech.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Imitate You1," Babies are good at listening to human speech. They will begin to understand language before they can actually use it themselves. To ensure your baby learns to copy you by speaking for itself, talk to your baby regularly.You could talk to your baby about what it’s doing. For instance, if your baby is playing with a toy, you could say, “That is a nice toy you have” or “Wow, what a great toy.”
Tell your baby simple words like colors, body parts, and names. For instance, when the baby sees something red, say, “That is red.” If the baby points to your hand, say, “That is my hand.”
Speak to your baby in an affectionate way.;
, When your baby sees you listening to it, it will learn to listen when you speak. This will help it socialize the norms of conversation properly. After speaking to your baby, give it time to respond and let it finish vocalizing before responding to your baby.Your baby will not be able to reply with words of its own for many months. However, your baby will try hard to copy your speech and will probably make sounds in reply to your communication.
Your baby might, for instance, make sounds like “ooh,” “bah,” or “gaga.”

, While it is important to speak to your baby in full sentences and not just baby sounds or one-word sentences, you should reinforce key words within sentences after giving your child the opportunity to respond to your sentences.For instance, you might say, “That is red,” then wait for your child to gurgle a reply.
Repeat the word red while pointing at the red object.
This will encourage your child to copy you by repeating the word red.

, At 18 months old, you can encourage your baby to imitate more complex speech. For instance, give your baby a plastic toy phone. With your baby’s full attention on you, take your phone out of your bag and say “Hello?” just as you would when answering the phone with a real conversation partner. Have a brief imaginary conversation, then say, “Good-bye.” This will encourage your baby to use its own plastic play phone in the same way."

Show your baby how to play.,
Model how to eat.,
Show your baby how to clean.,
Use common gestures to with your baby.,
Show your child basic body language.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Imitate You2," Play simple games with your baby. For instance, attract your baby’s attention by saying, “Baby, baby, over here!” in a happy and boisterous way. When your baby is looking at you, place both hands on your head. Remove your hands from your head, then put them back on your head several times. By repeating the action, your baby will be encouraged to imitate you.Play peek-a-boo. Use your hands to cover your face, then reveal your face to the baby while saying “Peek-a-boo!” Smile after making your exclamation. Repeat several times so your baby will be inspired to try to imitate you.Touching objects or toys with your hand several times in succession will demonstrate to your baby how their limbs work. They will therefore be equipped to imitate you later by doing the same thing.There’s no telling how many times you’ll need to repeat a given action before your baby will imitate you. Some babies are not much interested in playing games with adults. Other babies find great joy in imitating the actions of adults and others in play.
If your baby does not catch on right away despite your encouragement, help baby imitate you by moving its hands to the right place on the toy, or moving its hands to its head. Always be gentle when moving your baby.
These play behaviors are best encouraged when your baby is 41 weeks old or older.

, Sit your baby in a high-chair where they are secure. Ensure your baby is looking at you. Take a baby spoon and dip it in a soft pudding or gelatin. Open your mouth wide in an exaggerated and unnatural way. Take a bite of the sweet gelatin or pudding. This model will help your baby copy eating behavior.To test whether or not your baby will actually imitate you after your encouragement, dip a baby spoon into a jar of baby food and bring the spoon close to your baby’s mouth. Your baby should copy your behavior.
Try to make friendly, positive facial expression while feeding your baby. If you are dour or grim whilst feeding your baby, it might get the impression that eating is not much fun, and be disinclined to continue imitating you.

, When your baby is 18 months old, it can engage in more complex behaviors like cleaning – if you provide encouragement. Provide your child with a small toy broom so it can imitate your behavior. While your child is watching you, take your own broom and sweep your wood, vinyl, or other smooth floor. Bend over and sweep the dust and crumbs you’ve collected into a dustpan. Dispose of them in the bin., At 7-8 months old, your baby will be able to copy more complex gestures like clapping. In order to encourage your child to imitate your clapping, clap for your baby. You could clap slow or fast.Whether you choose a fast or slow pace, your baby will probably not be able to copy you exactly.
You could also show your baby how to love a doll. Hold a doll with one hand and gently pat its head with the other. Do this several times to encourage your baby to do likewise. (You could choose to make a kind and affectionate remark to the doll, such as “I love you, little doll.”) Then, give the doll to your baby.

, At 18 months, you can begin encouraging your baby to imitate simple body language. As in all other forms of imitation encouragement, the trick is to show the behavior you want your baby to imitate, then repeat it several times.


For instance, you could encourage your child to shrug. When bidding farewell to day-care workers, caretakers, or relatives, place your hand near your head with the palm facing toward the person who is leaving, or who you are taking your leave of. Move the hand back and forth (from side to side) in order to wave goodbye. Encourage your baby to do the same. Say, “Wave goodbye, baby.”
You could also encourage your baby to shrug by demonstrating how to shrug. Lift your shoulders and hold them at the highest point possible for a brief moment, then relax them again.
You could encourage a more exaggerated shrug by lifting your arms out at your sides with your palms facing up at about shoulder level.
Repeat your shrug several times in succession to encourage your baby to try shrugging for itself.

Choose the right time to encourage your baby to imitate you.,
Keep the focus on you.,
Be patient with your baby.",How to Encourage Your Baby to Imitate You3," Your baby cannot imitate you (or anyone else) until it is at least two months old. Wait to encourage your baby to imitate you until it is at least two months old.Babies can respond to stimuli and interaction, but they cannot actually imitate others until they reach the two-month mark. Any appearance of imitation is merely coincidental.

, When encouraging your baby to imitate you, limit distractions. Turn off the TV and radio. Hide toys and games. These things can distract a baby and make it harder to encourage them to imitate you., You might not see your child imitating your behavior right away. If your child doesn’t imitate you at first, just model the behavior again. Some children process what they’ve been encouraged to imitate over a period of time and only imitate the behavior later in private, or with playmates. If your baby does not seem interested in imitating you, choose another time to encourage your baby to imitate you."

Newborns will not be able to move much at first, so limit the time to a few minutes and watch carefully to make sure your baby is comfortable.


Some newborns may be uncomfortable on their stomachs before the umbilical stump falls off. If this is the case, you can postpone tummy time for a few weeks.;
, If your baby was premature or has health problems, get a doctor’s approval before beginning tummy time. And, as with all babies, do not put your baby on his or her stomach to sleep.

, If you put a little thought into scheduling tummy time, you can maximize the odds that your baby will enjoy it. Pick a time when your baby is alert, cheerful, and unlikely to be hungry, and consider building a routine by doing tummy time right after a diaper change.


You don’t want your baby to be hungry, but in general, it’s best not to schedule tummy time immediately after a feeding, either. This could lead to spitting up.
Never do tummy time when you are putting your baby to sleep. This should be a daytime, stimulating activity.

, For newborns, you can begin by lying down yourself, on your back, and placing your baby on top of you, stomach to stomach. Your newborn will feel comforted by your closeness and your heartbeat. As your baby grows, you can start using a flat surface (a big bed or a blanket on the floor) instead. Simply place your baby on his or her tummy on the flat surface; watch to be sure that your baby supports his or her head well. Be sure to stay close by and keep a watchful eye throughout the duration of the tummy time.


Babies have to work harder when they are on their tummies, so they may fuss at first when placed face down. Take it slow and pick up your baby if he or she starts crying or gets very upset.

, Be sure that the arms are forward in a way that the baby could use them to prop her or himself up. Babies with arms that are restrained or twisted backwards will not only be uncomfortable, but will be unable to reap the full benefits of tummy time.

, If your baby gets fussy, you can try sitting down and lying him or her across your lap. Keep one leg raised over the other, and put the baby’s head and shoulders on the elevated leg. Then you can sing, talk, and rub the baby’s back.


You can also try holding your baby under your arm on his or her stomach (taking care to support the muscles until your baby can do so). This isn’t as beneficial as true tummy time on a flat surface, though.

, If your baby cannot yet use his or her hands to push up, you can roll up a blanket and place it under the arms for support. Babies sometimes enjoy this change of position.


You can also use a nursing pillow as a prop.

, For very young newborns, you can start with just a minute or two at a time, then increase the time gradually, up to around an hour per day by the time your baby is four or five months old.


Your baby does not need to do an hour of tummy time all at once; it’s fine to break the time into several shorter segments.

, Don’t just place your baby on his or her stomach and walk away. Instead, you can lie down, facing your baby, on your own stomach. Then just talk, sing songs, make faces – whatever feels natural and keeps your infant entertained.

, As your baby grows, you’ll want to add colorful toys to tummy time. Try waving the toy in front of your infant’s head and moving it around; this will encourage your baby to lift his or her head, move it from side to side, and, eventually, to reach for the toy.

, If your baby cries or protests, it’s fine to end tummy time prematurely. The key is to offer your baby the chance to get accustomed to that position and exercise different muscles, not to force your baby through some rigid program. Keep tummy time fun and interesting for your baby.

, By the end of the first month, your baby may be able to lift his or her head for a short time and move his or her feet a bit, as if crawling.

, By two months, your baby may be able to hold his or her head up for a longer period of time and turn it to each side.

, By three months, your infant may be able to rest on the forearms and pelvis, especially with support from a blanket. By four months, you may notice that your baby can balance well on his or her stomach, and by five months, you may see that he or she will reach for toys.

, Your baby will get stronger and stronger over the first few months of his or her life. By the end of the seventh month, your infant may be able to hold himself or herself up with one hand while reaching for a toy with the other.

, Some babies begin to crawl in the eighth or ninth month. You may also see your baby start to pull up to something like a standing position.

Test the connection to ensure any noise the baby makes is audible on the mobile phone's speakers.,
Keep your mobile phone with you at all times.",How to Create a Baby Monitor with a Cell Phone1," Current mobile phones—especially smartphones—almost universally include these functions. You will also need to acquire a second mobile phone or ensure the availability of a landline phone.;
, Meanwhile, parents should carry the cell phone with the mute and speaker phone functions.

, Then, activate the mute and speaker phone functions on the parents' mobile phone. This ensures that parents can hear babies in the event they cry or struggle without creating noise that could awake or disturb the child.

, If you have established the connection correctly, parents should hear the baby while the baby will be unable to hear any noise from the parents phone.

, Because you've removed it from your pocket, bag or purse, you may be more likely to forget your mobile phone in the event you leave the room.

Obtain two smartphones.,
Find or purchase video streaming software.,
Connect your devices via the preferred software.",How to Create a Baby Monitor with a Cell Phone2," One will be used by parents, and the other will be positioned next to the baby. The advantage of using smartphones is that you can both watch and listen to your child. In most cases, you'll need smartphones using the same operating systems (e.g. iOS, Android or Windows)

, There are several popular applications designed specifically for monitoring babies, including Cloud Baby Monitor (available for iOS devices via iTunes), Dormi (available for Android devices via GooglePlay), Baby Monitor 3G (available for both operating systems via iTunes and GooglePlay) and Baby Monitor (available for Windows devices via Microsoft). These applications generally include additional functions like noise or motion alerts and lullabies.Cloud Baby Monitor includes a companion application allowing parents to visibly monitor their babies from other Mac devices like tablets or notebooks.
If you don't wish to purchase this software (which generally runs between $4 and $10), you can simply use a video streaming service like Skype, FaceTime or Google Hangouts. Simply connect two devices as you normally would for a video call. Though this software lacks unique baby monitoring functionality, it still allows for a audio and visual connection., This requires following the program-specific instructions for setting your devices up, adjusting preferences and ultimately connecting the two smartphones via the monitoring software or video call. Be sure to test the connection and video feed before leaving the room.

Is it the pronunciation of a name that makes it unique to you?
Knowing what unique means to you will help you narrow down your choices based on your personal criteria.;
, There are many advantages to having a unique name that stands out form the rest. Consider the way a unique name can benefit your baby in the future when deciding on a name.

, By choosing a very different name, you will be individualizing your child. This can be good for self-recognition and for standing apart from the others. Keep in mind that your choice of name will stick with your child through the ages. What may be cute for a youngster may not be as suitable for a teen.

, A unique name may not always be ideal. There can be downsides to giving your baby a unique name. It is always better to weigh the pros and cons of a name before deciding on it for your baby.


Keep in mind that an unusual name that is difficult to pronounce can bring unwanted attention to your child. Try to strike a balance. If the last name is a very hard one to pronounce correctly, be sure to keep the first name fairly simple. If the last name is a very simple name, strive for a more interesting first name.

,


Do you want one syllable, two or more?
Do you want the name to be soft and delicate or firm and strong?
Do you want a gender-neutral name or a name that is clearly masculine or feminine?

Do you want it to be comprised of more than one middle name?
Are you considering using just the first and last names?
Have you considered using just an initial as a first or middle name?

, Just about every name has at least one specific meaning that can be associated with it. Consider placing 2 names together based on their meanings to come up with an endearing name that fits your style.

, Repeat the name aloud to see how it flows.


Does it sound pleasant to the ear?
Will it generate teasing from others?
Say the name often until you get used to hearing it. Does it grow on you the more you say it?
Can you see yourself calling out this name over and over for the next 18 years and beyond?

, Many celebrities chose unique names for their children and often TV characters are given unusual names to play their character by. You can take a note from celebrity pages and use their names as inspiration for coming up with your own unique baby name.

, Many foreign names can have an exotic tone to them. Use your public library or the Internet as a source of information or consider purchasing a book of exotic names from a local book store.

, You may be pleasantly surprised at what you can come up with.

, Flowers, gems, nature and colors can make charming original names. Check into mythological names, famous artist’s names or well known writers names for some creative ideas.

, Pronunciation allows for many different ways to spell the same name. Consider the way the lettering looks when written out. Keep in mind that spelling may present an issue with proper pronunciation. Try to present a spelling solution that will prevent mispronunciation of the name.

, Between the two of you, it may be possible to come up with a very unique baby name. Both parents should be in agreement of the final choice. Perhaps if more than one name is going to be used you can both pick a name of choice.

Bend down to pick up the baby.,
Support the baby's head as you lift it.,
Hold the baby against your body for additional support.,
Slide your hands into the correct position.,
Hold the baby's head higher than their feet.,
Put the baby down gently.,
Cradle the baby while sitting down.,
Progress onto cradling the baby while standing up.,
Consider swaddling the baby before using the cradle hold.,
Feed the baby while using the cradle hold.",How to Cradle Hold a Baby," Rather than lifting the baby all the way up to your level, it is easier and safer to bend towards the baby as you lift her up. This minimizes the distance that the baby needs to be moved while only supported by the hands.


Bending towards the baby also maximizes the amount of eye contact you can make with the baby, as babies can only see about a foot in front of their eyes.
This eye contact is especially important if the baby is upset, as it will enable you to soothe and comfort them.;
, When picking up a baby (especially a very young one) it is very important to support the head and neck, as they do not have the ability to do this themselves. To pick the baby up into the cradle position, it's easiest if the baby is lying on its back.


Slide your dominant hand under the baby’s neck and base of the head so that your thumb is on one side of the face and the other fingers are on the other side. Do not grip too tightly. Instead, the baby’s neck and base of the head should be cradled in the palm of your hand with your fingers spread apart for more support.
Place your other hand under the baby’s rear, but from the opposite side of the baby (as if giving a hug). Once again, spread your fingers apart to give maximum support.

, Once you are bending over the baby and your hands are in the correct position, lift the baby and hold them against your chest. Holding the baby against your body provides additional support and will make it easier for you to slide your hands into the cradling position.

, Slide your dominant hand (which is currently being used to support the baby's head) down along the baby's back, while supporting their head with your arm. Move your non-dominant hand to the far side of the baby, to prevent them from rolling off your arm.


Ultimately, when the baby is in the cradle hold, their head is resting in the bend of your elbow while your dominant hand is cupped on their rear.
The baby’s legs are supported by your other arm while your non-dominant hand adds support to the baby’s midsection and protects against falls.

, In the cradle hold, the baby's head should be positioned higher than their feet, as this is most comfortable for both you and the baby. Remember to hold the baby close to your own body, but not too tightly., Although cradling the baby is a wonderful experience, at one point or another, you will need to put the baby down. Putting the baby down is basically the opposite of picking the baby up!


Once again, remember to lean over - as close to the baby's cot or seat as possible - in order to minimize the distance. Some people actually prefer to lean all the way over until their arms and the baby are supported by the bed or other surface before moving their hands and arms.
Gently slide your arms out from under the baby, keeping the head supported until you can lay it down gently.

, At some point or another, everyone is afraid that they might drop the baby. If you are really worried about cradle holding the baby while walking or standing, you can start off doing it while sitting.


Position a comfortable chair nearby and sit down immediately after picking up the baby. A rocking chair or a comfortable armchair will do perfectly.
This will help you to feel more confident, because if the baby does start to slip from your grasp, you can rest your arms on your lap in order to reposition the baby.

, Once you are confident with your ability to properly cradle hold the baby while sitting down, you can try it while standing up. Later you can progress onto walking. With practice, it will soon become second nature to cradle hold the baby.

, For exceptionally wiggly or upset babies, less confident people might find it easier to cradle hold the baby after swaddling it in a blanket.


Swaddling not only helps to comfort the baby, it also helps you to balance them more easily, as they aren't flailing their arms and legs.
For step-by-step instructions on how to swaddle a baby, see this article.


, Often women that are breastfeeding find that the cradle hold is an ideal position for nursing their baby. Babies can also be fed a bottle of formula while in this position.


When breastfeeding the baby, turn the baby so they are faced towards you and tuck their arm beneath their body, to make them more comfortable.

It can be difficult to anticipate when they will need each of these things.
It is useful to try to create a routine. For example, try to get up at around the same time each day. You will also need to feed them at regular intervals.
While a routine is helpful, you can't plan for every eventuality. So much sure to allow yourself some flexibility.;
, Babies need to eat multiple times a day. When you have triplets, multiple times can easily mean ""dozens"".

Maybe you are choosing to bottle feed. Make sure to prep several bottles at a time so that you are ready when your babies need to eat.

, Triplets formed a very close bond with one another while in the womb. Once they are born, they are still a great source of support for each other. Consider having them sleep together.You might want to try putting your triplets in the same crib. The can soothe one another simply by being near.
If your babies are sleeping together, they are likely to wake at the same time for nighttime feedings. This will help you manage feedings a little easier, even in the middle of the night.
When your babies nap, you should try to nap, too. Sleep schedules can be erratic, so take your rest when you can get it.

For example, you will only need one changing table and one activity mat.
You will also only need one breast pump and one baby monitor. One triple stroller will probably best suit your needs.
There are some things that you will need to purchase for each baby. For example, you will definitely need a care seat for each one. It might be a good idea to have multiple swings, too.

, Having multiples will cause dramatic changes to every aspect of your life. One of the biggest shocks can be the financial cost. Try to make a specific list of all of the additional costs you will have.Plan for healthcare. Your pre-natal and post-natal doctor's appointments will be costly.
Try to figure out how much your hospital stay will cost. Talk to your insurance provider about what will and will not be covered.

, Your life with triplets is going to be hectic. For the first few months, you are mainly going to be concentrating on feeding and holding your babies. That means that it is okay to make sacrifices in other areas.Your standards of household neatness are going to have to relax for a while. Tell yourself that it's okay if the dishes don't get done immediately or if the laundry pile lingers longer than normal.
You probably won't shower every day. You might not even get dressed every day in the early stages of raising triplets. Give yourself permission to be a little more relaxed.
You probably won't be up to cooking gourmet meals for your family while you're coping with triplets. Don't be afraid to turn to ready to eat meals.

Leave the baby alone with the parent.,
Encourage the bond between the parents.,
Spend time as a family.,
Reassure your child if they won’t stay with the other parent.,
Determine if one parent does all the disciplinary tasks.,
Share the responsibility of taking care of the child.",How to Deal with Your Baby's Preference for One Parent1," When your baby prefers one parent over the other, help by leaving the left out parent alone with the baby. This helps the baby interact and bond with the other parent without the preferred parent there to distract them.The parent and baby can move to a separate room or go out together, like to the park.;
, If you are the parent your child prefers, help the other parent by talking positively about them. Your child may take the lead from you and warm up to the other parent when they see that you like them.For example, you may say, “Your mommy is really good at playing tea party” or “You are lucky to have a dad like yours. He loves you so much and loves spending time with you.”

, To help your child grow closer to both parents, do things together. Let your child see you both interacting. If you are together, let them see you show affection towards one another. If you are not, show them you have a positive relationship.For example, you can eat meals together or take 15 to 20 minutes to play a game or read a story.

, Sometimes, a child may not want to stay with the other parent. If this occurs, reassure your child that they are safe with the other parent and that the other parent loves them very much.For example, if your child won’t let the other parent tuck them in, tell them, “Your mother/father loves you very much. They would love to tuck you in sometimes.” If they don’t want you to help them get dressed, tell them, “We are so lucky to be a family. We all love you so very much.” Then, try distracting the child with a silly face or by playing a game with them.

, Sometimes, preference comes from how your child interacts with both parents. If one parent does all the seemingly negative tasks, like discipline, making the child clean up, and enforcing bedtime, the child may be closer to the seemingly less strict parent.


If this happens in your family, share the discipline or ""negative"" tasks. That way your child will understand that discipline comes from both parents, and it is not a bad thing.

, If one parent takes care of the child all day, they may develop an attachment for that child. The child may also bond with the parent who takes care of them more strongly than the parent who doesn't. If this is the case, the other parent should take a more active role in taking care of the child.For example, if one parent works more and doesn’t help with meals, baths, or bedtime, the child may prefer the parent who is around all the time. To help with this, let the parent who works give the child a bath at night, read them a story, or put them to bed.

Foster individual interests.,
Make individual time a priority.,
Consider different classrooms.,
Budget carefully.,
Respect the bond.",How to Cope With Triplets2," As your triplets grow older, you will face new challenges. Since they are the same age, many people who don't know them will tend to view them as a unit, or even one interchangeable person. It's important for family members to treat each triplet as an individual.Help your triplets develop different interests. Let them try a variety of activities to find out what interests them.
Don't try to make them all conform to the same activities. For example, if one triplet loves soccer, that does not mean that the other two need to play on the team, too.
One of your triplets might be very musical. You can foster than interest without forcing the others to learn to play an instrument.

, Each of your triplets needs some individual attention from you. Find time to spend with each child individually. Group activities are fun, but make sure to do other things, too.Parents should spend one on one time with each child. Make that a priority in your weekly routine.
You don't always have to plan major excursions. Taking just one child to the grocery store with you can count as having one on one time.
Celebrate individual birthdays. Give each child their own cake, or special meal or activity.

, It is important to help your triplets develop individual personalities. Like all children, they need to learn to speak and think for themselves. Take care to place them in an educational environment where this can happen.When your triplets reach elementary school, think about placing them in different classrooms. For example, if the school offers multiple sections of first grade ask that each of your children be given a different teacher.
Your triplets might prefer to stay together and offer up some protest. Try to explain your reasoning to them.
You can say, ""You might enjoy having some time apart during the day. That way, you can all make new friends, and then you'll all know lots of new people.""

, Raising kids is expensive. Triplets can cause extra financial headaches since they will all reach the same milestones at the same time. Start a college fund early. It's a good idea to start setting money aside in individual accounts when your kids are young.
Think about health care. Look for an insurance plan that can offer good coverage for all of your kids.
Plan for the unexpected. For example, you might find out that all of your triplets need glasses. Try to have funds set aside for all sorts of costs.

, As a parent, you will naturally be very influential in your children's life. However, it is important to realize that triplets share a unique bond. Try to be respectful of the relationships that your triplets share with each other.Triplets might turn to one another for help making important decisions. For example, when they are trying to decide where to go to college, your opinion might not matter to them as much as their siblings' opinions.
Try not to take it personally if you sometimes feel left out. It is normal for triplets to bond with each other more than they do with others, even their parents.

Look for a support group.,
Ask for help.,
Make your relationship a priority.",How to Cope With Triplets3," You are going to have a lot of questions when raising triplets. That is natural. It might be useful to talk to others who are in your same situation.Ask your doctor for recommendations. Many hospitals offer all kinds of support groups, including groups for parents of multiples.
Consider joining an online support group. Many parents find online communities to be very helpful.
Support groups can provide advice on things such as, ""When should my babies begin tummy time?"" They can also provide support for times when you are feeling at your wit's ends.
Remember that you will usually know what's best for your babies. It's great to lean on others for support, but don't feel like you have to let someone else tell you how to raise your children.

, It's tough to raise kids. Raising three who are the same age can sometimes feel overwhelming. Don't be afraid to ask for help.Accept offers of help. If someone asks if they can lend a hand, say yes.
Be specific. If someone offers assistance, say, ""Sure, I would really appreciate it if you could run to the grocery store for me. Thanks so much.""
Voice your needs. If you need a break, tell your partner, ""I need a few minutes to myself. Can you please watch the kids?""

, Your triplets are understandably going to take up a lot of your time and energy. This is especially true when they are young. Many people find themselves putting less efforts into their marriage or partnership.It's normal to let things lapse. But it's also important to try not to neglect your relationship.
Be supportive of each other. If one of you needs a break, the other should step in with kindness and understanding.
Make time for each other. If you can't afford a babysitter, ask a friend or family member to come over and give you time to go grab dinner together.

Take your child with you.,
Let the other parent do certain tasks.,
Do something new with your child.",How to Deal with Your Baby's Preference for One Parent2," If your baby prefers the other parent, try to play with them more. Instead of putting them in a walker or playpen, or trying to get them to play alone, get down on the floor and play a game with them.

This may be helping your child move to solid food, looking at flowers in the spring, going to a museum or science center, or learning a new game.Make sure to talk to your child during these activities. The idea is to do something together you both will enjoy and that will help you bond.

For example, if one parent stays home all day, then the child may develop a preference for that parent due to being around them more than the other parent.

, You may be upset because your baby prefers the other parent. Even though this may be the case, don’t be angry at your child. It is okay to let your child know you are upset or are hurt.

This can lead to a negative relationship and hurt the child as they grow.You should also not try to buy your child’s love. Instead, try to bond with the child and fill their emotional needs like the other parent.

, You shouldn’t try dealing with not being the preferred parent alone. Talk to the other parent, especially if they are your partner. This helps you not bottle up your feelings and refrain from feeling resentment.When you talk to the other parent, you may discover that they feel overwhelmed because the baby is clinging to them and needing their attention constantly.

Babies born prematurely are less likely to be able to process bilirubin because their livers are not sufficiently developed.Babies whose blood type is incompatible with the mother's type -- known as ABO Incompatibility -- may be born with higher levels of bilirubin in their blood.If the baby is significantly bruised during birth, the breakdown of red blood cells may increase bilirubin levels.Babies can develop ""breast milk jaundice"" for two reasons: the presence of certain proteins in the mother's milk, or the baby not receiving enough milk, which leads to dehydration.Some babies can have liver, blood or enzyme problems or other medical problems that can lead to elevated bilirubin. Also, babies can have an infection which can cause elevated bilirubin.;
, Your doctor may recommend feeding an infant with jaundice up to 12 times a day. Since latching and sucking problems can cause the infant to receive less breast milk, consider enlisting the aid of a lactation consultant who is trained to help mothers feed their babies.Feeding the baby more often will encourage bowel movements, which eliminate bilirubin.If increased breastfeeding does not reduce bilirubin levels, your pediatrician may direct you to supplement the baby's diet with formula or expressed breast milk., Phototherapy involves exposing the infant to light in the blue-green spectrum.The light waves pass through the baby's body and into the blood, where it converts the bilirubin into materials that the baby's body will be able to excrete.The baby will wear soft eye patches to protect their eyes from the light. They are also able to wear a diaper during the therapy.
The baby will likely have loose, frequent, and possibly greenish bowel movements as a side effect of phototherapy. This is normal and should end when the treatments have stopped.While direct, natural sunlight can help lower bilirubin levels, it is not recommended as treatment. It is too difficult to measure and control both the level of sunlight exposure and the baby's body temperature during exposure., The biliblanket is a advanced, fiber-optic based phototherapy treatment. The biliblanket consists of woven fiber-optic material that is placed directly against the baby fully expose the infant to light. It allows the baby to be held and nursed without interrupting the treatment. The biliblanket may cause the baby's skin to look bleached or reddened, but this is actually part of the treatment process that will resolve when bilirubin levels are lowered. , If the jaundice is caused by an infection or other medical problem, such as increased breakdown of red blood cells, your doctor may recommend other treatments such as medications or even a blood transfusion.

, The bilirubin production system can run into trouble at one of three points: before, during, and after bilirubin production. Each of these problems can result from a set of related conditions:


Adults can develop what is called ""unconjugated jaundice"" when the problem occurs before bilirubin is produced. This is most often caused by reabsorption of a large blood clot or by hemolytic anemia.During the production of bilirubin, adults can develop jaundice as a result of viruses such as hepatitis and Epstein-Barr, autoimmune disorders, and overconsumption of alcohol or certain medications including acetaminophen, oral contraceptives, and steroids.If the adult develops jaundice because of problems after bilirubin production, the problem may lie in the gallbladder or pancreas., If you have jaundice, you will want to have your bilirubin levels checked. Jaundice can be an indication of a serious health issue. Usually, your doctor will work to find and treat the cause of your jaundice and treat any complications of the jaundice. The jaundice itself is not usually treated. Sometimes a medication may be given to help with itching, which is a common symptom of jaundice.Jaundice is often accompanied by other symptoms, which may help your doctor determine the cause:

Short term jaundice, which is caused by infection, may be accompanied by chills, fever, abdominal discomfort, or other flu-like symptoms.
Jaundice caused by cholestasis -- the interruption of the flow of bile -- may be accompanied by itching, weight loss, darkened urine, or lightened stools., A number of uncommon medical disorders can lead to elevated bilirubin and jaundice.


Gilbert syndrome is a genetic liver disorder. Patients have a reduced amount of the liver enzyme needed to break down bilirubin. Although present from birth, symptoms, which include jaundice, fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal discomfort, may not appear until young adulthood.Crigler-Najjar disease is an extremely rare condition that is also caused by an enzyme deficiency. There are two types of this disease; the more common one, called Arias' syndrome, can be treated so that patients can live a normal or near-normal lifespan.People with sickle cell anemia or other blood disorders also have a higher risk of jaundice.

, Alcohol can damage the liver, which leads to increased bilirubin levels, so limit your consumption to the recommended daily allowance (1-2 drinks per day depending on your age). Some people may be advised to completely eliminate alcohol consumption. Alcohol can damage the liver in three ways:


By leaving excess fat in liver cells. This condition is known as fatty liver disease. Many people who have this condition do not experience symptoms, but those who do may experience discomfort and fatigue.By causing scarring and inflammation of the liver. These symptoms may indicate alcoholic hepatitis. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. Alcoholic hepatitis can sometimes be reversed by abstaining from alcohol.This can also be caused by viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis.
By disrupting the functioning of the liver. Cirrhosis of the liver is characterized by severe scarring of the liver and disruption of its ability to process food and to remove harmful substances from the blood., Studies have shown that obesity can be more damaging to the liver than alcohol consumption.Obesity can lead to fatty liver, even in children.


Foods that are high in fiber are particularly good for the liver, including fruits and vegetables and whole grains.Certain foods are more likely to damage the liver, including those high in fat, sugar, or salt. Other foods that may damage the liver include fried food and raw or undercooked shellfish., Hepatitis A, B, and C are all viruses that negatively affect the liver. Avoid contracting the disease by taking precautions:


Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for everyone starting shortly after birth. Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for certain high-risk people or those traveling to high-risk areas.
If you are traveling to areas of the world with high rates of hepatitis, get vaccinated before leaving.
Hepatitis can also be contracted through risky behaviors such as intravenous drug use and unprotected sex., Be aware that some medications, including over-the-counter pain medication and common prescription drugs such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, antibiotics, and anabolic steroids, can cause toxic hepatitis. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure if you are taking medications that may be harming your liver.


Some alternative medicines thought to improve liver health and function have actually been linked to liver damage. Consult your doctor before taking alternative medicines. Some of the commonly used herbs that can damage your liver include green tea, kava, comfrey, mistletoe, Chaparral, and skullcap.The liver is responsible for breaking down medications, and it is possible for them to cause damage during this process. Acetaminophen is the most commonly used over the counter medication that can damage the liver."

Have them use their legs.",How to Choose Suitable Baby Toys (6 to 12 Months)," This is the best free toy you can give a child. Open both ends of a cardboard box for their tunnel or fort. Children at this age LOVE to crawl and explore, so give them every opportunity to do so. Washed ""Pringles"" cans can act like microphones and they love to get in and out of boxes (great for stretching the legs).;
, Any material that they won't rip easily or come apart is recommended. They're also better and easier for the child to turn pages rather than regular paper. Look for books that have different textures, ""peek-a-boo"" pop-ups, and bright pictures to them.

, Stuffed animals and toys that sing the different parts of the body, ABC's, different baby songs, and everyday greetings can teach your young one.

, Buckets that have different shapes for example triangles and stars encourages the child to match the pieces into the correct holes.

, Plastic and ""pretend"" machines and ""gadgets"" for example cell phones, keys, and other ""adult"" imitation objects can let them become adults in their own way. Motor skills and other developmental areas can really blossom with these toys.

, A great exercise toy, for example a Evenflo Exersaucer, can keep a baby entertained and safe. Sitting down or standing up, posture and leg strength are both used for these kinds of toys.

Note: Keep in mind that this is just an approximate timeline; some babies will develop slower or faster than the times indicated, especially if they were born premature. It's more important to track how your baby is progressing over time, rather than assessing his/her skills at a given moment.;
, Motor skills are the movements that happen when the baby's brain, nervous system and muscles all work together. Fine motor skills involve small movements, such as those of the fingers, toes, wrists, mouth and tongue. If your baby if developing normally, you should notice the following milestones:

, Infant development is a process in which infants learn new skills over time. This development usually occurs in a predictable manner: for example, babies usually learn to sit before they stand, and babble before they learn first words.


Infants learn many skills over a short time but just like adults, some babies are better at some things than others. For instance, some will tend to talk a little earlier than average, while others will learn how to walk before their peers.
Since development varies from infant to infant, it is most useful to look at how things are progressing over time, rather than as a single snapshot. A common way to evaluate progress is by developmental milestones. These describe the approximate age at which babies learn distinctive skills, like following an object with their eyes, or reaching out to grab a block.

, Anticipating the usual sequence of developmental milestones allows parents to help babies learn.


For instance, when your infant seems ready to crawl, more floor time and calling her to crawl towards you gives her lots of opportunities to practice. Babies beginning to reach for objects should be offered lots of things to grab.
Studies have shown that when parents who are familiar with the expected course of infant development express concerns, they are very frequently correct. They often become aware of any problems sooner than the health care provider.
In most cases, early recognition of a developmental concern can enable more timely management, therefore the ability to recognize whether your child is on track or not is important.

, Developmental skills are grouped into a number of categories; keep in mind that these categories often overlap or are very inter-related.


Motor development refers to physical skills requiring muscle use and coordination. There are two types.






Gross motor refers to larger muscles and muscle groups that enable the baby to learn things like crawling and walking.
Fine motor skills are those requiring coordinated use of the small muscles of the hands. Examples of normal fine motor developments include reaching and grasping objects, and transferring something from one hand to another.



Speech and language development includes two main components.






Receptive language is the understanding of language. This may include written communication, but in the case of babies it refers to understanding what is spoken.
Expressive language development in babies enables them to use expression and spoken words to communicate or express thoughts.



Cognitive development refers to higher levels of thinking and understanding. Babies, like everyone else, receive information from all of their senses (vision, hearing, etc.) and then process it into a response or action.






Examples of normal cognitive developments include turning the head towards a familiar sound or voice, inspecting a new environment, and holding out the arms to be picked up.



Adaptive development (which includes aspects of social-emotional development) includes skills that involved in the early stages of becoming independent and self-sufficient.






Examples of normal adaptive developments are the ability to coordinate swallowing and breathing, sleeping through the night, holding the bottle, self-calming, and self-feeding finger foods.



, Following your baby’s developmental progress is exciting and reassuring.It's a good idea to keep a diary of when your baby reaches certain developmental milestones, as this can be a family keepsake, but it can also help to identify any patterns of developmental problems. If problems arise, the diary can provide useful information to your baby’s health provider.


If your baby reaches the expected age for a certain developmental milestone, but shows no signs of progress, it may be a cause for a concern. However, it's important that you take any extenuating circumstances (such as prematurity) into account and get the baby checked out by a doctor before you jump to any conclusions.
Things that you should report to your baby’s doctor as possible developmental delays (if your baby is at the right approximate age for them) are as follows:

The baby doesn't respond to loud sounds.
The baby doesn't follow moving objects with their eyes.
The baby cannot push themselves up with their arms.
The baby chokes or gags with feeding.
The baby generally does not seem to respond to you as expected for their age.



, The timetable for babies born prematurely may be delayed according to the degree of prematurity. Remember that continued development of new skills is often more important than looking at a single snapshot in time.


For example, a baby will usually start to pick up finger food and feed themselves between the ages of seven to nine months. However, a baby who was born two months premature may not start to do this until nine to eleven months of age.
Given the degree of prematurity, this is completely normal and still means that the baby is on track for normal development.

Watch for an allergic reaction.",How to Know Which Essential Oils Are Safe for Babies," Essential oils are a watery and clear liquid that generally isn’t oily. They come from different parts of plants like lavender or chamomile and can be used for a host of different physical and psychological ailments. Because they are highly concentrated, you only need a small amount to reap an essential oil’s benefits., Although there are no specific guidelines on the best age to start using essential oils, some people suggest not using them on babies under 3 months. Use your best judgment when considering essential oils for your baby. Remember that these powerful oils could be too strong for your baby’s skin or delicate respiratory system.Speak to your doctor or naturopathic doctor about using essential oils on your baby if you have any questions or concerns.Ask other moms about their experiences using essential oils on their babies. They may have suggestions about the best way to reap the benefits of essential oils without exposing your baby to toxic substances.

, A three month old baby is still relatively new to the world and accordingly delicate. There are only a few essential oils safe for topical use or diffusion on babies. You should only use 1-2 drops of the following essential oils per ounce of carrier oil on your baby:Chamomile
Dill
Lavender
Blue Yarrow

, Just like younger babies, those six months and older still have delicate skin and respiratory systems. However, you can use additional essential oils both topically and by diffusion on babies six months and older. Use only 3-5 drops of the following essential oils per ounce of carrier oil on your baby:Bergamot
Carrot seed
Cedarwood
Cinnamon bark, for diffusion only
Cinnamon leaf
Citronella
Coriander
Cypress
Fir needle
Geranium
Lemon, for diffusion only
Mandarin
Neroli
Palma Rosa
Pine
Rose Otto
Sandalwood
Spruce
Tangerine
Tea Tree

, While there are many essential oils you could select for your baby, there are also choices that you should always avoid for your baby. These can harm your baby’s skin and respiratory health. Stay away from the following essential oils:Cajuput
Chaste tree
Clove bud, leaf, or stem
Eucalyptus
Lemon leaf
Lemongrass
Marjoram
Oregano
Peppermint
Rosemary
Wintergreen

, Every essential oil has different properties that may not be ideal for many users, including babies. Because of this, it’s important to read the label of any essential oil you choose for your baby. The packaging can give you information on contraindications and dosing for babies.


Make sure that the label says the essential oil is 100% pure and natural essential oil. Adulterated essential oils may be more likely to harm your baby., You should never use a “neat” or undiluted oil on your baby. Carrier oils dilute the potency of your essential oil and can also help moisturize your baby’s skin. Mild oils such as coconut, almond, avocado, olive, or vegetable are excellent choices as a carrier for your essential oil.Mix 1-3 teaspoons of carrier oil with 1-5 of drops of essential oil, depending on your baby’s age. Use 1-2 drops for babies under six months and 3-5 if your baby is older.
Avoid diluting essential oils with water or other liquids because they may not make the mixture adequately mild for your baby.

, Before you use the essential oil on your baby, it’s important to do a skin patch of the oil mixture. Put 1-2 drops of diluted essential oil on the inside of your baby's elbow. Watch carefully for any reaction, particularly difficulty breathing or a change in alertness. If no reaction develops and you see no skin irritation after 24 hours, it should be safe to use on your baby. , The only two safe ways to use essential oils for babies are topical application and diffusing the scent. Never give a baby an essential oil internally or expose the scent directly to the nose and mouth.Apply the oil topically by bath or with a soothing massage. This can soothe and calm your baby, especially before bedtime. Be aware that many babies' sensitive skin and using an essential oil in bathwater may be too intense for them. Instead, you could try a massage with a mixture of essential and carrier oil.
Choose diffusion if you don’t want to apply anything to your baby’s skin. Diffusion means heating the oil and letting the scent waft through your baby’s room or your home. The scent can soothe and calm your baby as well. However, you should never use diffusion on any baby with a respiratory disease or asthma.

, Diffusers heat or cool your essential oil of choice so that the scent can circulate through your baby’s room. Remember to not leave the diffuser heating overnight to prevent fires.


Consider a cold air vaporizer for the best results with essential oils. Use the same mixture of essential oil and carrier oil when you add it to the diffuser.You can diffuse the oil for up to 15 minutes every hour for best results.Be aware that humidifiers break up essential oils into tiny parts so that you can inhale them. Because inhaling essential oils this can be dangerous for a baby, avoid diffusing the oil in a humidifier or other product not designated for use with an essential oil.Make your own diffuser by putting your chosen essential/ carrier oil mixture in a bowl of hot water. Place it in an area that your baby can’t reach to prevent scalding., Although many essential oils are safe for your baby, your baby may still react poorly to them. Keeping an eye out for signs of a possible allergic reaction to an essential oil can ensure you get prompt and proper medical care for your baby. Seek immediate medical attention if you see any of the following signs of an allergic reaction:


Redness
Hives
Blisters
Red or warm skin

Spread protectant under the nose.,
Avoid sticking anything in your baby’s nose.",How to Clean a Baby's Nose1," If your baby has a runny nose or crust around their nose, you should gently remove the mucus and crust. Dampen a cotton ball with warm water. Carefully, wipe the debris away. If the mucus is crusted underneath, soften it with the moist cotton ball before removing. This helps reduce discomfort.Make sure to wipe away from the nose, not towards the nose.;
, If your baby has congestion and mucus around or under their nose, clean this area during a bath. Rub a small amount of bath water or gently apply a wet washcloth around the nose area. This helps clear out the nose and remove any mucus under the nose., If your baby’s nose is irritated around the nose, you can soothe that with some kind of skin protectant. Make sure you use a skin protectant that is made for babies.You can use petroleum jelly, lip balm, or a product designed to help a baby's chapped skin., You should never stick anything in your child’s nose to clean it. Never stick cotton swabs, tissues, or cotton balls into your baby’s nose. This can damage your baby’s nose.When you use a syringe, you are not sticking the tip into your baby’s nostril. You are only resting it at the opening of the nostril.

Wait a few minutes.,
Place the end of the bulb against the baby’s nose.,
Clean out the bulb between each nostril.,
Repeat if there is still congestion after a few minutes.,
Wash the syringe.",How to Clean a Baby's Nose2," To help the break up the mucus, use nasal saline. Place your baby on their back and their chin tilted. Use a dropper to drop one to two drops into their nostrils. If the saline comes in a bottle with a pump, use the squirt pump to place one to two squirts into the nostrils. Try to let the saline solution stay in the baby’s nose for 10 seconds.You can buy unmedicated nasal saline at a pharmacy.
You may also make your own saline solution. Dissolve ¼ teaspoon of salt into eight ounces of warm water. If you make your own, throw the solution out at the end of the day and make a new solution the next morning. Store it in a covered clean glass jar during the day.
Don’t use saline drops on your baby for more than four days in a row. This can dry out their nasal passages.

, After you put the saline solution into your baby’s nose, wait for around two to three minutes. Hold your baby with their head lower than their feet. This helps the solution get down into the nostrils. The baby’s congestion may break up and the nostrils may clear. However, if after a few minutes your baby’s nose is not any better, then you need to clean it out., Take the rubber bulb syringe and squeeze the air out. This creates a vacuum to suck out the mucus. Carefully place the tip of the syringe against the nostril. It should fit snugly to create a seal. Gently let go of the bulb to pull the mucus into it.If your baby resists this process, stop and try again later.
Make sure not to stick the tip too far into your baby’s nose. This can cause an injury.

, Before you do the same thing to the other nostril, you must remove the mucus from the bulb. Remove the syringe from the baby’s nose. Squeeze the syringe to clean the mucus out of the bulb. You may have to use some force when you squeeze to get it out. Then clean out the second nostril.Place a tissue around the tip to catch the mucus you expel from the tip.

, Your baby should be breathing better after cleaning the mucus out of their nose. However, if their nose is still stopped up after five to ten minutes, repeat the entire process again, including the saline solution.Make sure you only clean out your baby’s nose two to three times each day. More than that may irritate their nose. Your baby may get the most benefit before eating or going to sleep.

, When you are finished, wash the syringe with soap and warm water. Place the tip of the syringe in the soapy water and squeeze the bulb to suck water into it. Shake the syringe to get soap all around the inside. Then squeeze it out.Rinse the syringe by squeezing warm clean water into the syringe multiple times. Continue to rinse until the water you squeeze out is clear. Even with regular cleaning, some bulb syringes can be prone to mold growth. Look for one that twists apart for easier cleaning and drying.
Let the syringe dry by placing it with the tip down in a glass.

Suck on the mouthpiece to clear the mucus.,
Wash the unit when finished.",How to Clean a Baby's Nose3," Place the tapered end of the aspirator into your baby’s nose. The tapered end is connected to a long, cylindrical tube that will collect the mucus from your baby’s nose.Make sure not to stick the tube too far into your child's nose. Place it just inside the nostril.

, At the other end of the tube is a mouthpiece that you place into your mouth. With the piece securely between your lips, suck on it to pull mucus from your baby’s nose. The intensity with which you suck will control how much suction is in your baby’s nose.The mucus will not be sucked into your mouth. The tube in your baby’s nose has a filter that will keep any mucus and germs from getting into your mouth.

, Once you are finished cleaning your baby’s nose, you need to clean it. Take it apart and wash the main tube, the nose tip, and the mouth piece. Use hot soapy water to wash the parts. Rinse well to make sure you’ve removed all of the soap.


Don’t wash the long tube that connects the mouth piece with the main tube. If you need to wash it for some reason, or it get water in, make sure to let it dry completely.

, Baby's health and safety is first, your sanity and well-being is second, vital household tasks like food preparation and having toilet paper third, and everything else much less important.

, It may be more effective to spend one whole Saturday evening doing laundry rather than two loads every day. Or go to a laundromat and get all the laundry done at once.

, Although this seems like a paltry amount, making sure things go back in place on a regular basis can make a big difference.

, While talking on the phone, unload the dishwasher or wipe a counter top. While watching TV, you can fold laundry, chop broccoli, or vacuum during a commercial break.


When cooking or washing dishes for a prolonged period of time, place the baby in a car seat and put the car seat somewhere on the kitchen floor out of danger, for example a corner. This enables them to see you (and vice versa) and relaxes them because they know you're still close to them.

, Get take-out. Buy baby food rather than trying to make everything yourself. Use paper plates when entertaining.

, Don't buy clothes that require ironing, for instance.

, Ask a friend or relative to babysit so you can clean. Even an hour can help.

, Wearing your baby frees your hands and may actually enable you to not only start, but actually--gasp!--complete a task. Your baby might just want company, and be fine with you folding laundry, washing dishes or using automatic mop on the floor as long as he or she is near you.

, Cover Baby with warm clean clothes, play peek-a-boo while you fold towels, dance with him while dusting, have her watch the microwave turntable as you defrost peas. As you unload the dishwasher, hand him a plastic dish to wave around.

Use the catch-up schedule if you get behind.",How to Make Sure a Baby Is Properly Immunized in His or Her First Year1," Your baby is due for their very first immunization the day they are born. Get your baby their first dose of Hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of their birth., Also called a vaccine schedule, this is a guideline created by your government agency that shows what vaccine or vaccines your baby receives at what age. Immunization schedules may vary a little depending on factors like your child's health and where you live. Generally, after your baby’s first shot at birth they get their vaccines at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 12 months.


You can ask your pediatrician for an immunization schedule.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the government body that regulates the vaccination schedule in the United States. They have a downloadable schedule available on their website.
The CDC offers a useful interactive tool to help parents stay on schedule. Simply enter your baby’s birthday and the tool will create a personalized schedule for you!

, Every time your baby receives a vaccination, schedule your appointment for the next one.Even if it’s not due for several months, this will ensure you don’t accidentally forget to schedule any vaccination.

Write the date of your next appointment on your calendar right away.

, You can ask your pediatrician for a vaccination record card, or you can create your own. Your baby's pediatrician enters each vaccination into an electronic registry called an immunization information system, but you should also keep a copy of your own records in a safe place.If you move or change doctors you should be able to provide an up-to-date record so you and your new provider can stay on schedule. You will likely need to show a record of immunization if you enroll your child in daycare, so have one on hand for easy access.

, Make sure that the pediatrician marks off each shot given to your baby during the office visit., If you get more than one month behind in your child’s vaccinations, or if your child has received no vaccinations before they are 4 months old, use the CDC’s catch-up immunization schedule. It’s not too late to get your baby the vaccinations they need."
"
Get financial assistance if you need it.,
Talk to your healthcare provider about your vaccination concerns.,
Ask your pediatrician about deviating from an immunization schedule.,
Learn what immunizations are recommended in your country.,
Get the suggested vaccines if you travel with your child.,
Take advantage of government agencies that provide vaccines.",How to Make Sure a Baby Is Properly Immunized in His or Her First Year2," If affording a doctor’s visit is a barrier to getting your child vaccinated, look for affordable options in your community. Many community health centers and public health clinics offer low-cost vaccinations, and groups who campaign for child vaccination might offer free vaccines at times. The Vaccines for Children program provides free or affordable immunizations through a doctor’s office for eligible lower income families.Check with your church, public health clinic, or community center for suggestions on local options for affordable care.
Get health insurance for your baby to make medical care more affordable. Medicaid is a good option for those struggling financially.

, Many parents worry that vaccines can make your baby sick or cause problems like autism; others wonder why their healthy child needs to be immunized. There are many misconceptions about vaccines. If you have any questions or concerns, speak to your doctor to alleviate your worry.

Immunizations can cause minor reactions like soreness, swelling and redness at the site of the injection. Your child may also get a low fever. This is not uncommon or dangerous, and it is not a sign that the vaccine is making your baby sick. It’s your baby’s immune system making the defenses it needs! Ask your doctor about things you can do to make your baby more comfortable after receiving a vaccine.
Other more severe adverse reactions, while rare, include fever-related seizure, encephalitis, anaphylactic reaction, and death. If your baby is having symptoms beyond the typical minor reaction in the hours, days, or weeks after a immunization call your pediatrician immediately., Each vaccine has conditions that may make your baby ineligible to receive it. For example, the flu vaccine contains egg protein. Thus, if your baby has a severe egg allergy, they shouldn't receive it. Your doctor can make alternate suggestions to protect your baby from illnesses if they cannot receive the vaccine., People in different parts of the world need somewhat different vaccines, based on what illnesses are more common there. Use this interactive tool created by The World Health Organization (WHO) to enter your country and get a custom vaccination schedule for anywhere in the world.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has a similar tool for European countries., You and your infant will potentially need additional vaccines if you travel to another part of the world. This will ensure you are both protected from diseases in other countries that you don’t have at home. Get information from the CDC about what shots you need for travelling.Children under 1 year old may not be able to get certain vaccines. Talk to your doctor and consider this before making travel plans with children aged 0 to 12 months.

, Some parts of the world have less access to immunizations than others. The United Nations are working to improve coverage around the world through health-promoting groups like UNICEF, the WHO, Gavi, the vaccine alliance, other local agencies, and The Reaching Every District (RED) plan.If you live in an underserved area, always take advantage of services provided by these groups."

Burp your baby frequently.,
Discourage extensive sucking.",How to Help Relieve Gas in Babies," Although there is no evidence for a connection between colic, or excessive crying, and gas, some people may link the two conditions.Identifying the signs of gas can help you quickly give your baby comfort. Symptoms of gas include:


Pulling up her legs
Clenching her fists
Squirming around as if she’s uncomfortable
Crying a lot
Farting
Burping;
, If your baby seems gassy, lay her on her back on a stable surface. Then begin moving her legs in a bicycling motion to help move her intestines and expel the gas.Move your baby’s legs gently so you don’t hurt her.
Talk to your baby while you’re moving her legs. This may distract her from her pain and also comfort her.

, Every baby needs tummy time to strengthen their upper bodies and keep their heads from getting flat. But tummy time has the added benefit that it can help expel any gas that has settled in her stomach.Make sure your baby is awake during tummy time and that you supervise her the entire time.Put your baby on her tummy on the floor or across your lap for at least 20 minutes a day.You can do this more often if she is gassy and not fussy during tummy time.

, Move trapped gas in your baby’s belly by massaging it. Not only can this relieve gas, but it may also soothe her.Rub your baby’s belly in a clockwise motion while she is lying on her back.Try a combination of massaging and bicycling to move and expel gas.

, There is some evidence that swaddling a baby can help relieve gas.If your baby is under 2 months of age, try swaddling her to provide comfort and help relieve gas.Avoid swaddling if your baby can roll to minimize the risk of SIDS or suffocation.Follow guidelines for safely swaddling your infant, which may help relieve her gas and help her sleep., Some babies expel gas when you move together with them or hold them in a certain way. Try rocking, bouncing, and the “gas hold” if your baby seems gassy.Use the “gas hold” by holding your baby securely over your arm facing down. You can gently rock her in this position.Rock your baby in a rocker or in your arms, which may move and expel gas.Bounce your baby gently up and down. You can do this either while you’re standing or by sitting your baby on your lap and bouncing her., Although studies suggest that they’re not really effective against gas, consider giving your baby anti-gas drops.Doctors believe this treatment is safe up to 12 times a day, but be aware that drops can be expensive.Look for anti-gas products with simethicone such as Mylicon, Little Tummies, or Phazyme.Follow packaging instructions.
Ask your pediatrician or pharmacist any questions you may have about the drops or using them.

, There is some evidence that probiotics, which help maintain “good” bacteria in the belly, can aid colic, which may reduce your baby’s gas.Although experts haven’t recommended probiotic as a treatment for colic, consider giving your baby probiotics to relieve and prevent gas.Speak with your baby’s doctor before using probiotics for gas. Ask the doctor if probiotics could help your baby.Look for products with Lactobacillus reuteri, which studies have shown can significantly reduce colic and may help your baby swallow less gas-causing air., If moving and soothing your baby doesn’t seem to help relieve your baby’s gas, schedule an appointment with her doctor. She can rule out any diseases or intestinal issues that may be causing persistent gas.


Tell your doctor what you’ve done to relieve the gas and if it is effective. Give the doctor any helpful information about your baby-- from eating to pooping habits.

, Crying may cause your baby to swallow extra air, which can lead to gas. Do your best to soothe your baby when she starts to cry. Rock her in your arms, pat her on the back, talk in a soothing voice to her.

You can also try to determine the reason why your baby is crying. For example, you baby might be crying because she is hungry, so feeding a little earlier than usual may help., Babies who are bottle fed are often more prone to gas because of air in the bottle and nipple.From holding the bottle at the proper angle to changing feeding frequency, making sure you optimize your baby’s bottle feeding experience can help prevent gas.Feed your baby more often but decrease how much you give her so that there is less pressure in her belly.Try out different sizes and types of bottles and nipples. Different models can slow the flow of liquid and the amount of air into her belly.Tilt the bottle to a 30 or 40 degree angle so that the air rises to the bottom of the bottle.Make sure your baby’s lip are on the wide base of the nipple and not just the tip.Try a different type of formula after consulting with your doctor.Allow the formula to settle after shaking or mixing it, or use a ready-to-feed formula., Breastfed babies may have less gas than bottle fed babies because the breast doesn’t trap air like a bottle. But as with bottle feeding, optimizing your technique may prevent gas in your baby.


Nurse your baby more frequently during the day to reduce the amount she has in her belly.Make sure your baby’s lips are sealed far back on your areola.See what causes your baby’s gas by eliminating certain foods for two weeks. Common problem foods include broccoli, brussels sprouts, beans, cauliflower, cabbage, and onions.Add food back in as you realize it doesn’t cause gas.For example, cut out foods most likely to cause allergies like dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat and fish., Keep your baby as upright as possible during her feedings.Consider keeping her upright during burping and for a half an hour after her feeding to minimize gas.Hold your baby at a 45 degree angle if possible., Step up your burping efforts by burping your baby during and after feedings.This may break up any gas bubbles and prevent them from forming. However, you should be aware that it may upset your baby if you interrupt her feeding.Try the following burping positions to prevent or relieve developing gas:


Place your baby upright on your shoulder and pat her back.
Sit her upright on your lap and lean her forward slightly while you rub or pat her back. Put your hand under her chin to support her chest and head.
Lay your baby on her belly across your lap with her head slightly elevated while you rub and pat her back., Many babies are soothed by sucking on a pacifier or empty bottles nipples. Avoid allowing her to do this for prolonged periods of time to prevent gas."

Let your baby sleep.",How to Lower a Baby's Fever," If you think your baby is running a fever, use a rectal thermometer to get the most accurate results. Place your baby on his or her stomach, or on his or her back with legs pulled up. Coat the base of the thermometer with petroleum jelly, and insert it slowly into the anus – only about half an inch, so that the metal part is inside. Hold the thermometer still, and, when it beeps, remove it and read the results.;
, Any rectal temperature over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) is considered a fever. If your baby is less than three months old, you need to call your doctor immediately or seek treatment at an urgent care center or emergency room. Young babies have very weak immune systems; their bodies cannot handle the minor infections that would not pose a risk to an older child or adult. If your baby is between three months old and twelve months old, you should call your doctor if the rectal temperature rises above 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius).


If your baby’s fever persists for longer than a day or two, even if it never rises about 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius), you should see your pediatrician as soon as possible.

, Certain symptoms warrant immediate medical treatment – either from your pediatrician or, if you cannot reach him or her right away, from an emergency room. Some of these symptoms can be hard to identify in young babies, so use your best judgment and err on the side of caution. If your infant has a fever and any of the following symptoms, seek medical treatment:


vomiting
diarrhea
earache
abdominal pain
headache
sore throat
painful urination
swollen joints
a rash

, Certain symptoms require emergency treatment. If you see any of the following symptoms, don’t wait to see if they resolve themselves. Call for help immediately.


unconsciousness or difficulty waking
signs of severe pain
stiff neck
seizure
blue lips, tongue or nails
difficulty breathing
dark purplish rashes or bruises
signs of dehydration – a lack of wet diapers, dark or strong-smelling urine, dry mouth, dry eyes, or sunken fontanels (soft spots)

, If you have seen a doctor, always follow his or her instructions regarding the care of your baby. Having seen your infant, he or she will know the best course of treatment. This article is meant for general guidance, not as a substitute for medical care.

, If you’ve determined that your baby’s fever is not high enough to warrant immediately medical treatment, or if your baby’s pediatrician has decided that your baby’s condition is not serious, you can focus on keeping your baby as safe and comfortable as possible. Making sure he or she stays hydrated should be a priority.


If your baby is young and still eating only breast milk or formula, continue feeding at the usual intervals.
If your baby is at least six months old and has started eating solid foods, supplement with water. If he or she has been introduced to juices, offer diluted fruit juice as well.
For toddlers and older children, you can freeze juice into popsicles as well.

, If your baby has begun eating solid foods, continue to offer them, but don’t force the issue – fevers sometimes decrease the appetite. As long as your baby gets enough fluids, you don’t need to worry about solid food.

, If you dress your baby in heavy clothing, his or her fever may rise. Let body heat escape by dressing your infant in light, airy clothing and covering him or her, if necessary, in a light blanket.


Babies often sweat when they have fevers. Change your baby’s clothing if it becomes damp. This will minimize discomfort and prevent chills from developing.

, Don’t try to bring down a temperature by bathing your child in cold water (unless you are advised to do so by a doctor), and don’t try to ease your baby’s chills by using very warm or hot water, either. Stick to lukewarm water.

, In addition to regular baths, sponge baths may help your baby feel more comfortable. Lay a dry towel on a surface that can get wet (like your bathtub or the floor). Place you baby on the towel. Using a bucket or bowel of lukewarm water, get a sponge or washcloth damp (not soaking wet), and gently wipe your baby’s head, eats, face, and neck. Then move on to the rest of your baby’s body. Dry your baby well, and dress in clean, light layers.

, Help your baby get as much rest as possible, both through daytime napping and nighttime sleep. Hold, rock, or sing to your baby if it helps, and keep your baby’s room a comfortable temperature.

, Your baby’s doctor may have specific guidelines for administering medication to reduce fevers and make your baby more comfortable. For example, he or she may want you to wait until the fever reaches a certain point, especially if your baby is more than three months old; this is because so many fevers resolve themselves, and in these cases, it can be best to let nature take its course.


If your baby is younger than three months old, never give any medication without consulting the pediatrician first.

, If your baby is younger than six months old, acetaminophen (sold under the brand name Tylenol) is the preferred medication for fevers. Choose a liquid version designed for infants, and use the oral syringe provided to administer the correct dosage. Determine this dosage using your baby’s weight – this is the most accurate method.


Consult your doctor and the manufacturer’s instructions, but in general, you can give your baby another dose of acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours.

, If your baby is at least six months old, you can give ibuprofen (sold under the brand names Advil and Motrin) instead of acetaminophen. Choose a liquid version designed for babies, and use the oral syringe provided to administer a proper dosage. As with acetaminophen, use your baby’s weight to determine the dose – this is the most accurate method.


Consult your doctor and the manufacturer’s instructions, but in general ,you can give your baby another dose of ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours.
Once your baby is over six months old, ibuprofen has additional advantages over acetaminophen. It lasts longer, reduces swelling, and has anti-inflammatory properties.

, Unless specifically instructed by your doctor, do not dispense any other medications. Baby aspirin is especially dangerous; it has been linked to a condition called Reye’s syndrome, which causes the liver and brain to swell.

, Unless otherwise instructed by a doctor, there’s no need to wake your sleeping baby to administer fever reducers. Let your infant get as much rest as possible.

Tell stories to stimulate visualization ability.",How to Help Develop Your Baby's Eyesight," In the first four months, a baby can only focus on an area between 8 and 12 inches from their face. Your baby will respond to movement in the first week.Exposing your baby to light during the day and small amounts at night can not only soothe them, but also help develop their ability to focus on you and other movements.Use a nightlight or another dim lamp in your baby’s room. The best way to tell if the nightlight is dim enough for your baby is that you can’t see the light through your eyelids.Choose a red or amber light to avoid disrupting the production of melatonin.;
, Each of your baby’s eyes will develop on its own. In order to stimulate each eye equally, change your baby’s position in your arms or a crib frequently.Move the position of the crib frequently as well as where your baby is in it.
Alternate sides when you are holding or feeding your baby., You likely interact a lot with your baby by talking to them or showing them toys. During your baby’s first four months, they will begin following you and other objects when they move. Make sure to keep any objects within 8-12 inches of your baby so that they can focus on them.Speak to your baby when you’re walking around the room. This can help further develop the ability to focus as they grow.
Hold toys that are in bold geometric patterns and colors close to your baby. Recognize that babies don’t generally develop color vision until about 4 months old. However, showing them bold colors such as red, orange, yellow, blue, black and white can help develop color vision., At any age, your baby may have a problem or exhibit other potential issues with their eyesight. Seek prompt medical attention if your baby shows any of the following signs from birth to 2 years:Inability to track an object with their eyes by 3-4 months
Trouble moving either or both eyes in all directions
Jiggling eyes that cannot hold still
One or both eyes crossed or turned outward
Light sensitivity (blinking, closing eyes, or showing distress in light)
Pupils that appear white
Persistent draining or watering from eyes

, Your baby begins to develop hand-eye coordination and depth perception at around four months.Hanging objects such as mobiles or crib gyms above their crib or changing table allows your baby to pull, grab, and kick at the mobile. This helps further develop your baby’s eyesight.Make sure that toys and other objects you hang above the crib are easily within sight of your baby. Grasping for things will stimulate their vision.Remove mobiles or any other hanging objects from above your baby’s crib once they can push up on their hands and knees. This can prevent your baby from reaching the mobile, which increases the risk of strangulation.Consider hanging up a colorful poster near your baby’s changing table or close to the crib for further stimulation., Every baby needs plenty of time to play and explore. This can help your baby further develop and stimulate their vision, including hand-eye coordination and depth perception. Plan for plenty of play time for your baby that includes exploring the floor or base of a playpen.Place an array of colorful plastic or wooden blocks that your baby can grasp and hold. You can also use household objects such as ladles and balls to stimulate your baby’s vision., Games that move your baby’s hands and legs and involve talking further stimulate vision.As a part of your daily playtime, incorporate games such as patty cake and peek-a-boo. This can help develop your baby’s eyesight., If you haven’t started already, read your baby books. Select books with a simple story and colorful pictures that you can show to your baby. This helps develop your baby’s visualization abilities as well as providing even more enjoyment for you and your child., At around seven to ten months, your baby will recognize partially hidden objects.Incorporating hide and seek games with toys or even your face can further develop your baby’s eyesight, including visual memory.Place a soft blanket partially over a favorite toy such as a stuffed animal. Then say, “What is that, Vera? Where is Mickey Mouse?”Use a window to play hide and seek with your baby. Your baby will likely recognize you through the glass.

, Your baby is likely becoming more curious with each passing month. Naming toys or other objects that your baby plays with helps develop their eyesight even more. It also encourages your baby’s word association skills and vocabulary development.Say the object clearly and offer praise when you’re naming things your baby has. For example, “Is that a block, Gabriel? Wow, you have a red block! And look, you stacked it on a blue block.”

, Between 8 and 12 months, your baby’s eyesight is connected to movement and memory. Encouraging crawling and creeping, along with other activities, can strengthen your baby’s ability to see things as well as touch and remember them.Let your baby have plenty of playtime that incorporates time on the floor for crawling or creeping from one piece of furniture to another.

, Your baby began following movement with their eyes during the first few months of life. This skill will continue to develop as your baby gets older. By the time your baby is one to two years old, rolling a ball back and forth with them can further develop their eyesight. It also helps your child learn to track objects visually as well as develop hand-eye coordination.Use a brightly colored ball to further stimulate your baby’s eyesight. Identify the color to help with vocabulary and word association.

, Eyesight is important to helping your baby develop fine motor skills as well as small muscle development. Give your baby toys such as zippers and building blocks that encourage hand-eye coordination. This can not only help develop their eyesight, but also boost fine motor skills and small muscle growth.The following toys and activities can help further develop your baby and toddler’s eyesight:Bright balls
Blocks
Zippers
Peg hammering toys
Markers and crayons
Puzzles

, Many people start reading to their babies at a very young age or even in utero. Continuing to read and tell your baby stories past their first birthday can both help develop your child’s eyesight and visualization skills. This also will help your child learn and read in the long run.Show your child the pictures in storybooks or describe images to your child as you tell stories. For example, “Snow White was a fierce warrior who lived in a big white castle. The gardens were filled with beautiful and fragrant flowers in lots of pretty colors.”

Consider the similarity in nutritional value.,
Avoid counterfeit formula.,
Prioritize consistency.,
Be aware that most formulas contain GMOs.",How to Know if Generic Baby Products Are Safe1," Nutritionally, generic infant formulas are essentially identical to brand name options. This is because all infant formula is required to meet the same nutritional standards, including minimum amounts of specific nutrients.Many manufacturers actually include a bit more of the required nutrients, to ensure the nutritional content of the formula maintains the minimum specifications for the product’s entire shelf-life.
While different brands may have slightly different “proprietary” blends of ingredients, these differences are not nutritionally significant. They may affect taste and texture, but that’s about it.
In fact, many generic formula brands are actually made by the same one or two manufacturers, and effectively mimic brand name formulas - sometimes exactly.;
, One concern regarding formula is that a product has been relabeled at some point during distribution. While this is both illegal and uncommon, it has occurred. For example, baby formula has been relabeled with new “use by” dates that do not accurately reflect the age (and thus the nutritional content) of the formula.Do not be overly concerned about counterfeit formula, but it is worth noting any changes in color, smell, or taste of the formula you use.
When purchasing by the case, check the “use by” dates on formula containers and compare them to those on the box. They should always match.
Contact the manufacturer directly with any questions or concerns. There will be a toll-free number on the formula’s packaging.

, A generic formula option is likely the best option. There's no good reason to go with a branded option, and generic options tend to cost about half as much. When you buy a branded baby formula, you're not paying more for a better product, you're paying more for fancy labels and other marketing costs.Once you settle on a generic that your baby favors, try to stick to it. This is easier on your baby’s digestion.
Your doctor will probably recommend a name brand formula. They do this because they have financial incentive to do so. The hospital will probably even send you home with brand name samples, for the same reason. Don’t fall for the marketing.

, Believe it or not, the three companies that sell over 90% of the baby formula sold in the U.S. use GMOs in their formulas and foods. Namely, Similac, Enfamil, and Gerber brand baby foods all include GMO corn, sugar beets, and/or soy.While GMOs have been approved for use in most countries, there are developmental concerns tied to their use, as well as potential environmental issues associated with their growth.
Unfortunately, many generic baby formulas also contain GMOs. If a product is not labeled as GMO-free, you can expect that it likely does contain GMO products.

"
"
Realize most generic products are comparable to name brand products.,
Beware of packaged baby lotions.,
Use coconut oil or olive oil instead of baby oil.,
Minimize your use of baby cosmetics.,
Select sunscreen carefully.,
Check products for safety online.,
Consider manufacturer and country of origin.",How to Know if Generic Baby Products Are Safe2," Generics are often just as safe and effective as branded counterparts, often have identical ingredients list, and are sometimes even made by the same manufacturers. Further, any product that is regulated by the FDA or Consumer Product Safety Commission must meet the same standards, whether it is name brand or generic.


For instance, baby wipes - including generics - are regulated by the FDA, since they are intended for cleansing and moisturizing skin and are considered a cosmetic product.That said, many products - both branded and generic - commonly sold for babies do contain ingredients you should watch out for.

, There are some products you should be especially wary of, whether branded or generic. In general, the products that you use regularly on your baby - such as lotion - should be free of potentially harmful ingredients. For instance, you want to avoid synthetic fragrances, parabens, and phenoxyethanol - some of which are even contained in brands that are markets as ""natural"".When possible, use chemical-free moisturizers. For instance, shea butter and olive oil can often be used to moisturize instead of artificial baby lotions.

, The important thing to remember about baby oil is that is should never contain mineral oil. Unfortunately, both branded and generic options often do. Instead of using these options, simply use coconut or olive oil instead of baby oil., Cosmetics designed for babies frequently contain toxic chemicals that should be avoided. This is true for generic baby products as well as branded ones. While these products are not intended to be consumed, they can be absorbed through the skin.Products you should use sparingly include shampoo, wipes, lotions, bubble bath, and even baby oil.
Use only enough soap to wash dirty areas. Use a washcloth with warm water and a bit of mild soap to wash the places where bacteria is likely present, such as the diaper region.
Baby soaps generally have minimal additives, and are generally safe in small amounts. This is true both for generic and brand name baby soaps. However, the potentially carcinogenic chemical ingredient propylene glycol is somewhat common, and should be avoided in any product.

, Consult your pediatrician before using any type of sunscreen on a baby that is younger than six months old.Beyond six months of age, sunscreen use is important to protect your child, though many sunscreens should not be considered reliable or safe. That said, generics are equally as safe as branded products as long as they meet certain criteria.In general, avoid spray sunscreens. These often do not provide great coverage, and risk being inhaled. Further, an SPF value over 50 is simply unnecessary.
More specifically, oxybenzone and retinyl palmitate should be avoided. Oxybenzone is surprisingly common in sunscreens, both generic and branded.

, If you're unsure of an particular product or ingredient's safety, don't hesitate to research it yourself online. The FDA's website is a great website to check, and can alert you if a certain product has been recalled.Additionally, the Environmental Working Group has compiled a database of cosmetics products and has rated them for toxicity and safety.


Use the EWG app to search specific products, including generics. Though it often recommends expensive options, the app is useful to check any product for especially dangerous ingredients., Other important criteria to help guide your safety considerations are country of origin and specific manufacturer. These are important because they reflect the regulatory standards the product had to meet. While these criteria alone cannot be considered sufficient to deem a product safe, products manufactured in North American or Europe likely had to meet strict regulatory protocols, whether they were branded or generic.Though people often associate branding with safety, a generic product from a country with a strong regulatory system can often be assumed to be equally safe.

Steer clear of antibacterials.,
Check labels for common dangerous ingredients.,
Avoid products with artificial fragrance.,
Skip products with parabens.,
Watch out for 1,4-dioxane and ethoxylated surfactants.,
Talk to your baby’s doctor.",How to Know if Generic Baby Products Are Safe3," Antibacterial soap and other antibacterial products do not actually protect your baby. In fact, they increasingly put people at risk. Many baby products - generic or otherwise - that are labeled as antibacterial contain a chemical called triclosan. This is not only carcinogenic, but it will mess with your child’s hormonal balance, as well as their ability to fight off sickness naturally., With any baby cosmetic product - generic or branded - there are certain ingredients that you should avoid altogether. For instance, several toxic chemicals, including octinoxate, oxybenzone, benzone, and homosalate are commonly included in baby sunscreens, generic or otherwise. Whenever chemicals known to be toxic are present, do not use the product.Talc is another ingredient that may be wise to avoid, as it can irritate your baby’s lungs and may even be carcinogenic. You can commonly find generic baby powder without talc., Fragrances are often comprised of unlisted chemicals that are known to be harmful. In fact, “fragrance” is best seen as an umbrella term that obscures the presence of chemicals that have been tied to allergies, hormone disruption, and neurotoxicity. Unfortunately, fragrances are often present in items - both generic and branded - from wipes to cleaning materials.Use the website GoodGuide to search baby products by category and filter out those with fragrances.

, These especially common ingredients are in many cosmetics ingredients, including those for babies. These include both branded and generic options. They can be toxic to both your baby’s nervous and reproductive systems, not to mention other potential harmful effects.Do not use products with any ingredients that contain the word “paraben”, nor the ingredients benzoic acid or propyl ester.

, More than half of baby soaps contain 1,4-dioxane, a known carcinogen. It is a byproduct of adding ethylene oxide to other chemicals. Pretty much, avoid any ingredients that contain the letters “eth”.Look closely at each ingredient. For instance, “sodium laur(eth) sulfate”.
Ingredients that include “ceteareth”, “oleth”, “oxynol”, and “-xynol” should also be avoided.

, Whenever you’re unsure of the safety of a particular product, don’t hesitate to ask a medical professional that knows you and your baby. They will likely be able to recommend the safest option for any type of product you’re looking for.More specifically, ask them something like, “What should I watch out for in products of this type?” That way, you’ll know how to look for the best option yourself, which may be the cheaper, but equally safe, generic option.

Remove the scales with your fingers.,
Wash the baby's head every day.,
Use oil and jelly.",How to Get Rid of Cradle Cap1," The baby's scalp won't be harmed if you use your hands to take off the ""cap."" It's the simplest, and one of the most effective, ways to get rid of the scales and dry patches that occur when a baby has cradle cap.


Rub your fingers over the scaly patches, then gently peel and scrape away the scaly dead skin and discard it.
If you don't want to use your fingers to pick off the scales, put on a pair of thin latex gloves (as long as your baby isn't allergic to latex). You could also cover your hands with plastic wrap to prevent directly touching the scales. Keep in mind that cradle cap is not contagious, and picking off the scales will make your baby more comfortable.
Don't use tweezers or another sharp tool to remove the scales, since you may accidentally poke the baby's head and cause an injury.;
, Use warm water to bath the baby's head, and gently massage his or her scalp with your fingers. The water will help loosen the cradle cap scales, when you can then peel or scrape away.


Using a mild baby shampoo can help loosen the scales, so consider adding one to your washing routine. However, you may find that shampoo dries the baby's scalp out further.
Use a soft-bristled brush to help loosen the scales while the baby's head is still wet.

, Sometimes cradle cap scales need a little outside help before you can peel them off. Spread baby oil or petroleum jelly on the dry patches, then wait 15 minutes to let the scales soften before removing them.


Olive oil and vegetable oil also work well for removing the scales.
Use shampoo and warm water to wash away the oil when you're finished. Leaving traces of oil can actually make the problem worse by causing more scales to form.

Use a medicated dandruff shampoo.When cradle cap keeps coming back a few days after you scrape it away, switching to a medicated shampoo a few times a week might be an effective treatment.,
Consider using hydrocortisone cream.",How to Get Rid of Cradle Cap2," Dandruff shampoos contain tar, which reduces flakiness and helps prevent skin from drying out.


Shampoos containing the antifungal medication ketoconazole or 1 percent selenium sulfide may also be used to treat cradle cap.Dandruff shampoos that contain salicylic acid aren't recommended for babies, since this ingredient may be harmful to babies and it can be easily absorbed through their skin.Talk to your doctor before using a medicated shampoo on your baby's scalp. He or she will recommend a shampoo brand or provide you with a prescription for the shampoo that is right for your baby's needs.

, If your baby's scalp is inflamed, red or itchy, hydrocortisone cream, which is also used to treat rashes and bug bites, might help relieve the symptoms. Check with your doctor before using an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream."
"
Humidify your home.,
Moisturize the baby's scalp after bathing.,
Consider the baby's diet.",How to Get Rid of Cradle Cap3," Infants with cradle cap often have other symptoms related to dry, easily-irritated skin. Use a humidifier in your baby's room to keep the air moist and humid so his or her skin doesn't get too dry., Applying a moisturizer while the scalp is still slightly damp and warm after bathing can help trap moisture in the skin, preventing it from becoming dry and scaly. Use a lotion or ointment formulated for babies' sensitive skin.

, Cradle cap is in some cases caused by an allergy to baby formula. If your baby has red patches on his or her face and experiences diarrhea and other allergy symptoms in addition to cradle cap, talk to your doctor about switching to a formula that is healthier for your baby."

Wash your baby's skin with water and mild baby soap.,
Avoid scrubbing the skin.,
Gently pat the skin dry.Use a soft terry bath towel to gently pat the skin completely dry.,
Do not use oily lotions.,
Do not squeeze the bumps.,
Be patient.,
Do not use over-the-counter medications designed for adolescents.,
Only use over-the-counter remedies with your doctor's permission.,
Ask for a prescription cream.,
Inquire about dietary changes and other possible causes.Some conditions may masquerade as baby acne when, in actuality, they are something else entirely.",How to Get Rid of Baby Acne," Wash your baby's face with warm water on a daily basis. For severe baby acne, a mild soap may also be used.


Use soap formulated for babies whenever possible. Soaps meant for adolescents or adults may be too harsh for your baby's skin.
If you cannot use soap meant for babies, use a mild moisturizing facial soap or a soap with a high percentage of emollients.These soaps are usually mild enough for most babies, but you should stop use immediately if your baby's skin turns red or if the acne gets worse.
Do not wash your baby's face more than once a day. Over-washing the skin can irritate it, causing oil-producing glands to work even more and ultimately creating more acne.;
, When you wash your baby's face, do so by patting it or wiping it down gently.


Since baby acne is caused by over-active oil glands rather than dirt, scrubbing the skin will only irritate it and cause the glands to produce more oil.
Use a soft sponge or terry washcloth to wipe your baby's skin.

,


Do not wipe or scrub your baby's face dry, since doing so can further irritate the skin and produce more oil.

, Avoid applying lotion to the face, especially over acne-covered patches, since lotion can aggravate the problem.


Even though the patch of acne may seem dry, the fact that it is caused by over-active oil glands means that adding further oil will only make the acne worse.
If you are concerned with how dry your baby's face seems because of the acne, use a moisturizing baby soap as you cleanse the skin to minimize further drying out and pat the skin dry as soon as possible.
If your baby's skin seems especially dried out, you could also try a non-oily cream instead of an oily lotion.Only apply the cream to a small patch of skin and monitor it closely to make sure that the skin does not get worse. If the cream seems to help, you can apply it to the rest of the affected area.

, Do not, under any circumstance, attempt to “pop” your baby's zits, since doing so is never helpful and is almost always harmful.


Squeezing the acne irritates the skin. As the skin gets irritated, the oil-producing glands react by producing more oil. More oil can cause even worse acne.

, A breakout of baby acne usually disappears within a few weeks to several months without special treatment.


Even though this skin condition can look awful, it rarely causes your baby pain or discomfort. If it does, however, you can go to your doctor for more advanced, professional treatment.
Baby acne usually makes its first appearance at the 2 to 4 week mark, and it can last until your baby is 5 to 6 months old. The breakouts are usually at their worst between 6 and 12 weeks of age.
Note that baby acne is usually most severe when your baby is hot and fussy.
Baby acne generally lasts longer with breast-fed babies, since the same residual, oil-triggering hormones that the baby was exposed to in the uterus can come through the mother's milk, too. As a result, it often begins clearing up as your baby is weened off of breast-milk. It may even clear up sooner if your baby's oil glands have matured enough to handle the hormones before then.

, Creams and ointments formulated for adolescent or adult use are far too harsh for a baby's sensitive skin.


Using over-the-counter acne medication can irritate the skin, making the acne worse. It can also cause your baby's face to become excessively dry. Worst-case scenario, your baby's skin could become so dry that it begins to cause him or her pain.

, In most cases, over-the-counter creams will only irritate your baby's skin and should be avoided. In special cases, though, your doctor may recommend a mild 1 percent hydrocortisone cream or ionic colloidal silver solution.


Hydrocortisone cream treats the dry, itchy, and sometimes painful skin that results from severe cases of baby acne. By soothing the skin, the cream reduces the production of oil, ultimately leading the a clearer complexion. Note that hydrocortisone cream can hurt your baby if it gets into the eyes or mouth, though.
Ionic colloidal silver solution is generally considered safer than hydrocortisone cream. It kills the bacteria that thrive in facial oil and soothes itchy skin.Only apply a small amount of either product to your baby's skin and use the product for a maximum amount of twice a day for two days., If the baby acne on your child's face appears to cause pain or discomfort, or if it lasts past a couple of months, your doctor may prescribe a gentle prescription acne cream to help clear the baby's skin.


The cream is almost always a retinoid cream. Retinoids are a type of chemical compound that regulate the growth of skin tissue.
Common retinoid creams used to treat baby acne include adapalene, tazarotene, and tretinoin.
Apply the medicated cream as directed. Typically, the cream is applied topically by smoothing it over the affected area once a day, roughly 20 to 30 minutes after you wash your baby.,


If your baby is older than four to six months, the bumps on your baby's skin are less likely to be acne.
Eczema is the next most common skin condition your baby may face.
These bumps could also be the result of a mild allergic reaction to a new food introduced into your baby's diet. If you recently began your baby on a new food or drink, stop giving it to your baby and report the results to your baby's doctor.

Pull the front half of the clean diaper up onto the baby's stomach.Ensure that your baby doesn't bunch their legs or the diaper might be uncomfortable. Try to spread the baby's legs so the diaper will fit comfortably.
If you're changing a newborn diaper, use a newborn diaper that leaves room for the umbilical cord stump. Or fold over the front of the diaper so you don't cover it.

, Hold the front of the diaper in place with one hand. Use your other hand to pull the tabs on each side of the diaper and fold them up towards the front. Fasten them onto the diaper so the diaper is secured to the baby. Avoid fastening the diaper too tightly.Check to see if the diaper is too tight. If it is, the skin will look pinched or red. You should also ensure that the tabs aren't sticking to the baby's skin.

, Pull the onesie down and snap it closed or put your baby in a new outfit. Set the baby in a safe place while you fold the dirty disposable diaper. Throw it in the trash or in the odor-sealing canister, then wash your hands.To fold the dirty diaper, fold the front part of the dirty diaper in half towards the back of the diaper to make a slight ball shape.

Grab the front half of the diaper and pull it up onto the baby's stomach.Spread the baby's legs so the diaper won't bunch while you're fastening it.
If you're changing a newborn diaper, ensure that you're using the smallest cloth diapers. You'll probably need to fold them specially so they don't rub against the umbilical cord stump.

, Hold the front of the diaper in place with one hand. Use your other hand to hook a T-shaped fastener or a two-pronged fastener onto the front of the diaper. Your cloth diaper might use snaps that you simply snap into place or velcro that you can just pull and press down on. Dress the baby before you handle the dirty cloth diaper.If you're using diaper pins, put a few of your fingers under the diaper and above the baby's skin to so you don't accidentally poke the baby.

, If you're handling a poopy diaper, take it to the bathroom and dump as much of the poop into the toilet. You can use a diaper sprayer to remove larger amounts of poop. Place the dirty diaper and any dirty cloth wipes into a diaper pail or hanging wet bag and wash your hands. Wash the cloth diapers according to the manufacturer's instructions.If you're changing a poopy diaper from an exclusively breastfed baby, you don't need to dump the poop in the diaper.

Organize the changing area.,
Stock up on diapers and wipes.,
Store diaper cream or petroleum jelly.,
Have a place to put soiled diapers.,
Keep distractions nearby.,
Store changes of clothing and extra sheets.",How to Change a Diaper4," Set up one or two diaper changing spaces in easy-to-access spaces in your home. For example, you could set up a changing table in the nursery, your bedroom, or near a bathroom. If you don't want to use a changing table, you can easily change the baby's diaper on a comfortable flat surface (like a bed).


It's a good idea to pack a diaper bag or backpack with some diapering supplies. Keep the diaper bag in the changing area so you can stock it and then grab the bag when you need to leave the house.

, You might need more than just a diaper and some wipes to change the baby. Keep things organized and easy to find by using dividers, containers, and small baskets. This way you know right where something is if you need it quickly.


For example, it will help to have a drawer or basket that has extra pajamas or pacifiers if your baby needs a change in the middle of the night.

, Newborn babies can go through 8 to 10 diapers a day, so keep a lot of clean ones nearby. They should be easy to reach so you don't have to step away from your baby during the diaper change. You'll also need to keep wipes nearby to wipe your baby's bottom.If you're constantly refilling the diapers at your diaper changing station, consider leaving a new box of diapers in the same room. This way, you'll never be completely out.

, Babies frequently get rashes and you might need to apply diaper cream or petroleum jelly. Keep tubes of these at your diaper changing area so you can easily use them when you notice a rash.It's also a good idea to keep these in your diaper bag so you can treat your baby's rash when you're out together.

, Decide how you'd like to dispose of or handle the soiled diapers. For example, if you're using disposable diapers, set up a trash can or odor-sealing canister. If you're using cloth diapers, you may want to set up a wet pail where you can store the diapers until you're ready to wash them.It's a good idea to keep hand sanitizer nearby to quickly clean your hands before you wash them in the bathroom. Remember to keep the hand sanitizer out of your baby's reach.

, As the baby gets older, you'll need to distract them during diaper changes. Distracting the baby with a toy, object, or book will also keep the baby from grabbing soiled diapers or squirming during the diaper change. Consider keeping some of these near your diaper changing station:Small board books
Pacifiers
Toy keys
Rattles

, If your baby has leaked through their diaper, you'll need to have a change of clothes close by. Keep several clean onesies at the changing area just in case. You should also have a few sets of clean crib sheets in case these get dirty.If your changing table has a soft, removable cover, you should also have an extra clean cover in case the baby gets the cover dirty during the diaper change.

The water should be between Between 90 °F (32 °C) and 100 °F (38 °C). Once you have the appropriate amount of water, shut it off and swirl the water to ensure there are no especially hot spots.Touch the water with the inside of your wrist. The sensitivity of your wrist is a more trustworthy temperature indicator than your hand. The water should feel warm, not hot.
Never add water to the tub with your baby in it. The water can quickly become dangerously hot.
You may want to set your water heater to 120 °F (49 °C). This will still allow you to get hot water, but will prevent potentially scalding water from collecting in the water heater.;
, Wet babies are especially hard to hold. To prevent your grip from slipping, place your baby along one of your arms. Make sure the baby’s head, neck, and back are supported. Always use one of your arms to support them while you bathe them with your other arm., Start by cleaning your baby's face with disposable cotton pads or a freshly laundered and rinsed cotton cloth. Wipe from the inside corner of one the baby’s eye outwards. Repeat the process on the other side. Don’t rub or push too hard. Dab softly but repeatedly if necessary. Next, wipe the rest of baby’s face, from the middle outwards.Make sure you clean around their nose and mouth, behind their ears, and in the creases of their neck.
Do not put anything inside your baby’s ears, nose or mouth.
Periodically pour cups of warm water over your baby’s body to keep them from getting too cold.

, After washing their face, wash the rest of the baby top to bottom and front to back. A soapy washcloth cloth is best. Use only cleansers meant to be used on babies. These will be very mild, and will minimize irritation.Do not use regular soap or shampoo to bathe your baby. Some very mild soaps may also be appropriate for use on babies. Ask your pediatrician if the cleanser you have is ok for babies.
Avoid getting any type of cleanser in your baby’s eyes or mouth.

, Wet the baby's hair and massage in a small portion of baby shampoo in a circular motion. Then rinse with your hands or a cup of warm bathwater., For both baby girls and boys, wash the diaper area from front to back.

Do not pull back the foreskin on an uncircumcised boy.Don’t forget a final rinse of your baby’s full body. Use several cups of warm, clean water.

, Use one of your arms to support your baby’s head and neck. Reach beneath the baby’s bottom, and wrap your fingers around one of their legs. Use this arm to support the baby’s weight as your lift them slowly. If possible, have another adult take the baby from you in a clean, dry towel., Always use a clean, dry towel to dry your baby.

Clean up the changing area.",How to Change a Cloth Diaper," You might choose to use the kind of flat cloth diaper that you fold and prepare yourself to get the desired shape, or you might use the pre-fitted cloth diapers, which already look like a diaper but can be rewashed and reused.;
, Use the method provided in How to Fold a Cloth Diaper ahead of time, so you don't have to do this when you have a wiggly baby in front of you later. Babies love to wiggle and roll around on the changing table, so if you're ready to go with your diaper, you'll be able to keep them safer.

, You can do this on a changing mat on the floor and not have to worry about watching the child wiggle around as much, or you can use a diaper-changing table or even a bed or couch, depending on the size of the child.

, Lay a waterproof changing pad (such as those reusable pads included with most diaper bags) or Goodnites Underpads on the changing surface to prepare a mess-free changing environment.

, In addition to the diaper and the baby, you may need a secondary pair of rubber pants, one or two extra cloth diaper pins, a bottle of baby powder, a tube of diaper rash cream or similar, some cleaning cloths or baby wipes, and a fresh change of clothes. Place them all in the diaper changing-area so you can grab the items one-handed without leaving the baby alone.


Set up an easy-to-reach spot on the changing area where you can temporarily stash dirty items like the old diaper and any dirty clothing, before you clean them up properly after the change.

, If you smell urine or poop in the diaper, or the diaper is sagging noticeably, it might be time for a change.


Infants don't notice (and most don't care) when you feel around the top of the diaper to take a peek. You can usually also feel whether the diaper is full from the outside, with your hand.

, Lay them down on the pad so that their rear end is in the pad's center.

, Remove clothes that have become dirty. Work bottom to top, removing any pants and folding up any shirts/dresses if needed.


If the child is wearing a onesie, you will need to roll that clothing up until it is out of the way of the diaper-area. Use the Ankle Hold Technique as described to hold up the child’s leg while you pull the onesie up and out of the way.

, Rubber pants help protect the child's clothes from getting soaked. They can rip rather easily at the leg seems if removed too harshly, so be gentle.


Let the rubber pant turn inside out as you pull it off the child. This can help you wash/dry them more easily, and you can flip them back the regular way around next time you use them.

, If the diaper doesn't use pins, look for a Velcro fastening or a pair of snaps along the child's waistline near the sides or near the front of the diaper. Undo the pins or snaps, or loosen the Velcro tabs. Just don't take the old diaper off just yet.

, Lay the front of the diaper back on the changing surface so the diaper is flat.


For boys, you may want to leave the diaper loosely in place until the last minute, to prevent any spray if they urinate at the wrong time.

, You can use a wet, clean cloth if you prefer, or baby wipes.


You can also use a clean and dry area of the old diaper to help absorb any leftover mess, but use a clean cloth to do a final cleanup for sanitary reasons.
Use two warm, wet washcloths if you would like to be more environmentally-friendly. Use the first washcloth to wipe off the most mess, and then use a second washcloth to finish cleaning the baby's bottom. Be sure the cloths are laundered well before next use.

Make sure to keep baby’s genital area covered with a cloth, as many babies will urinate into the air when exposed to the cooler air in the room. Clean your baby's front and back, making sure you get any mess that's hiding between folds of skin. For baby girls, make sure you wipe front to back to avoid infection.

, Raise the child's legs by holding their ankles to remove the diaper from the table, and swap out the old diaper for a new one. Place the new one underneath the child at the same time you take out the old diaper out, and lower the child's legs back to the surface. (You can always readjust the diaper's position later to re-center the diaper, if necessary.)


Position it so that the center of the back of the diaper is about on center with the child's bottom, so that the back of the diaper will reach no higher than the child’s waistline.
After pulling the child's legs up, you may want to fold up the old diaper so the front of the diaper is holding onto any poop that may be inside the diaper. That way, you can put one hand underneath the bundled diaper, lift and drag the diaper away. Just be careful you don't drop any mess out.
For those who choose to use prefold diapers that have a Velcro or snap closing system, you may need to keep your hand outstretched inside the diaper until the child has been laid back down onto the surface, so the diaper doesn't fold back onto itself under the baby.

, Apply some diaper rash cream on their skin and/or place some powder down onto their cloth diaper and over their bottom to prepare the area, if they're prone to diaper rash.

, Hold the diaper firmly as you move it around and place it properly. Lay the dry diaper temporarily on the child’s waist so that you can obtain the new pins or get ready to fix the new diaper up again.

, The amount of diaper you flare back out at the bottom will depend on the child’s weight and width of their waistline.


Only flare out and work with one side of the child's diaper at a time. You can repeat this for the other side later.

, Grab any two pins that aren't in use yet and secure the diaper, reversing the pin's removal from the preparatory steps above. Insert the pin into the diaper and close the pin. Do not push each pin through all the layers of the inner diaper, so you don't risk sticking yourself and your baby. Be sure to insert the end of the pins away from the child’s navel/belly button.


Snap the diaper pins closed from both sides. Diaper pins are created with an open section in the pin-head. Push the pin around and into the head of the pin’s opening, and push inwards so the pin-head is covering this end of the pin.

, If the rubber pants weren't wet when you removed them (or can be dried with a towel or paper towel easily), you can reuse the same pants. Otherwise, use another pair of rubber pants and add the older ones to the pile of clothing that needs to be washed.

, Replacing their pants and socks before folding back down their shirt. If the child was wearing a onesie and it's still dry, lower it down and re-snap the garment in place.

, If there are other people who can help you, have them help watch your child and keep them busy.

, Put the pile of wet clothes and dirty diaper in your hamper or diaper pail. Stow away any extra pins, the diaper rash cream, and baby powder.


Dispose of any poop by cleaning the cloth diaper inside a toilet. Then roll the diaper carefully up into a ball, and bring this diaper to the laundering station for washing.

This is one of the reasons a sling is so useful – when she’s right next to you, the natural, rhythmic up and down of your walking will soothe her. It’s great for any colicky baby and entirely effortless on your part.

, Changing your baby’s posture is helpful for two reasons: firstly, the change of position may help to move the contents of her intestines and allow her to expel gas, thus relieving the colic. Secondly, the change of position may be interesting for her, distracting her from the colic. Here are some ideas:


Try laying your baby across your lap, stomach down.
Try laying your baby along your forearm, with her head in your palm and her feet in the crook of your elbow.
Hold your baby upright in your arms, facing either towards you or away from you.

, When your baby is suffering from colic, try bringing her outside or even carrying her into a different room. The new environment, colors, smells and sounds will draw the baby's attention, distracting and soothing her.


When we’re in pain, babies and adults are no different. It’s easy to get consumed by how we’re feeling, but it’s also sometimes easy to forget about if our environment is stimulating enough. Providing her with adequate distraction and stimulation may be what she needs to forget for a moment how she feels.

, There are several exercises you can do to stimulate your baby’s intestines and help her to pass wind, thus relieving colic. These include:Making your baby ride a bike. Lay your baby on her back, grab her legs and move them in a cycling motion, as if she were riding a bike.

Using a ball. Blow up a beach ball and lie your baby on top of it, on her stomach. Roll the ball backwards, forwards and around. This massages her stomach, relieving her pain.

, Swaddling your baby will help her to feel warm and secure while sleeping. Swaddling will also restrict her movements, which will help to prevent her from waking herself up due to sudden body movement that she cannot yet control.


To learn how to do this correctly, see wikiHow's How to Swaddle a Baby for more information.

, Your baby needs lots of attention and love when suffering from colic, so make sure that you keep her close at all times and give her lots of cuddles. Cuddling will help to keep her calm and soothe her colic.


There's nothing your baby wants more than to know you're right there. Even if she's sleeping, she'll know you're right there and take solace from it – hopefully staying asleep longer.

, Massaging your baby’s stomach can help to stimulate the bowels and relieve tension, thereby alleviating the colic. To massage your baby’s stomach:


Lie her on her back and spread some baby oil on her bare stomach.
Use your fingers to gently massage her stomach, using a clockwise circular motion.

, If your baby is swallowing air while she eats, this increases the amount of air in the stomach, leading to greater gas production. You can reduce the amount of air your baby swallows by:Using a bottle with a smaller aperture (hole), if your baby is bottle-fed.
Making sure your baby latches on to the breast properly, if she is breast-fed. You can do this by holding your breast in your hand until she picks up the nipple.

, It is essential that you burp your baby after every meal to ensure that she gets rid of any excess gas that can make colic worse. Lift your baby from her chair, hold her over your shoulder and pat her back gently until she burps.


wikiHow has a whole bunch of knowledge on the topic from How to Burp Babies to How to Burp a Sick Baby to How to Burp a Baby on a Knee.

, Feeding your baby large amounts in one go can increase gas and abdominal pain. Therefore, if your baby is suffering from colic, it’s much better to feed her in small amounts, approximately every two hours.Do not increase the overall amount that she eats. She should be eating what she would normally eat, just spread out throughout the day. If you're concerned she'll eat more or less, portion out the food beforehand so you know what's normal for her to be eating.

, Certain foods can upset your baby’s stomach and make colic worse. These foods are to be avoided:


Avoid dairy products for several weeks to see if your baby’s condition improves. Sometimes babies are allergic to cow’s milk, and this makes their colic worse.Breast-feeding mothers should avoid eating wheat, eggs, caffeine and chocolate as these foods are a potential cause of colic in babies.
Gradually eliminate foods from your diet one by one, and watch your baby’s condition closely to see if it improves. This will help you to identify specific foods that are causing your baby’s colic.

, If your baby is formula-fed, the particular formula could be causing the colic. Speak to your doctor to see if they can recommend another type of formula that could improve your baby’s symptoms. Many triumphs against colic come down to trial and error.

, Heat can have a calming effect on your baby, as it relaxes the muscles, eases pain and relieves stomach cramps. To make a warm compress:


Fill a baby bottle with warm (not hot) water and wrap it in a clean towel. Make sure the water isn't hot by testing it on your wrist.
Hold the compress against the baby’s stomach for several minutes. After that time is up, remove it. Your baby's skin is sensitive and shouldn't be overheated.

, A warm bath works in a similar way to a hot compress, as the heat soothes the stomach. In addition, a bath can be a fun distraction for your baby and can be bonding time for the two of you.


Try to make bath time as fun as possible, especially since your baby has colic and needs the respite from the pain. Make bath time play time to make this moment doubly soothing.

, Babies under 6 months should be fed exclusively with breast milk or formula and do not require any additional liquid. However, babies older than 6 months can benefit from drinking tea. Here are some ideas:Basil tea. Basil has sedative properties thanks to its high eugenol content. Add a tablespoon of dried basil to a pot of water and boil it for 10 minutes. Strain the basil and allow the tea to cool before giving it to your baby.

Chamomile tea. Chamomile helps to calm a nervous stomach, making it a good choice for colicky babies. Add a tablespoon of chamomile flowers to a cup of boiled water and allow it to steep for 10 minutes. Strain the flowers and allow the tea to cool before giving it to your baby.

Mint tea. Mint helps to soothe muscle spasms and cramps. Add some mint leaves to a cup of boiled water and allow them to steep for ten minutes before straining the leaves and giving the tea to your baby.

, Gripe water comes in the form of droplets that can be added to the baby’s milk or dropped directly into the mouth. The drops contain caraway, dill and fennel combined with other ingredients like chamomile or ginger, which help to soothe the stomach and ease colic.


The drops can be given to your baby every four hours in order to keep colic at bay.

, Colic may be caused by a disruption in the level of microflora in your baby’s stomach. Probiotics can help to restore the balance of bacteria in your baby’s stomach and relieve colic. They're good for the rest of the body, too. If your baby is old enough, introduce yogurt to her diet to reap these benefits.


Probiotics are not normally given to babies before the age of six months, so talk to your doctor to see what he/she recommends.

, It’s important that you consult with your doctor before you give your baby any natural remedies, and that you follow your doctor’s recommended dosages very carefully. Otherwise you risk making your baby sick or making the colic worse.

, If your baby won’t stop crying and you are feeling overwhelmed, then you need to step aside and regroup. Enlist the assistance of a family member or a babysitter to tend to your baby so that you can have some time for yourself.


This isn’t being selfish or putting your needs before those of your baby. It is a safe way to release the strain and tension of caring for a colicky baby. Remember, you can’t be any help to your baby if you are tired and irritable. She needs you to be at your best as much as you want to be at your best.

, If there isn’t anyone that can watch your baby, and you still need to take a break, do not leave your baby home alone. Instead, place your baby in her crib where she is secure and close the door so that her cries are muffled. Go to a different part of the house and turn the baby monitor on very low.


Try to relax yourself before returning to comfort your baby. Breathe deeply, find your focus, and return when you're ready.

, You don’t have to be away from your baby for long and it doesn’t matter what you do to relax yourself and regroup. You can go to a movie, go for a walk, go out for a quick lunch, or even take a nap in another room. Anything that allows you to have some time to yourself to relax is a good idea.


Keep in mind that this will pass sooner than you know it. Before long she'll be talking and running around. In the future, these might be moments you cherished.

Collect supplies beforehand.,
Keep the baths short.,
Never leave your baby in water.",How to Give a Baby a Bath in the Sink2," Make sure you have everything you need before bathing your baby. This will ensure you don’t have to risk making you baby cold by bringing them to get something in another room.

These tubs cost between $20 and $70 and are available online or from stores such as Babies'R'Us.

, The most important criteria in choosing where to bathe your baby is safety. To improve the safety of a sink, clean it thoroughly with soap and water and then rinse the sink completely. Further, line the sink with rubber, or even a thick towel. This will provide cushion and provide a less slippery surface."

You will learn that babies as young as a few days old may benefit from probiotics.
A pediatrician might recommend baby formulas or foods that contain probiotics.
Your pediatrician may prescribe probiotics as part of a treatment.
Ask your pediatrician if they think you should give your child probiotics. For example, say ""I've heard about the benefits of probiotics for babies. Do you think they are safe for my baby?"";
, Cultured vegetable juice is a great source of probiotics that is easy to acquire and give to your baby. It can have the same beneficial qualities as other sources of probiotics, including supplements.


Start providing juice when your baby is a few days old.
Provide your baby with a small baby spoon full of juice.
Repeat this three times a day.
Cultured vegetable juice can also be given to your baby between 10 to 20 minutes before feeding time. This may aid in digestion.

Some examples of probiotic supplements for babies include: Udo’s Choice Infant’s Probiotic or Garden of Life RAW Probiotics Kids., Talk to your pediatrician about the best time to introduce dairy to your baby. Dairy products are one of the most common and popular sources of probiotics. Dairy products containing probiotics can found at most all supermarkets and in any region of the world.

Kefir
Yogurt
Aged cheese like cheddar or gouda., Not only will probiotic cantaloupe soup be easy for your baby to eat, but it will also be easy for you to prepare. To create cantaloupe soup:


Blend 1 cup of cantaloupe and 1 cup of mango until the mixture is creamy.

Babies given probiotics for colic tend to cry about half as much as babies that aren’t given it.
Children taking probiotics to ease colic may vomit less than kids that aren’t given it.
Babies given probiotics tend to have more bowel movements than babies that aren’t given it.
Only provide your baby probiotics for colic under the advice of a medical professional., Doctors increasingly agree that babies given probiotics may be at a decreased risk of developing allergies as children. This is important, as most life-long allergies are developed as children.


Babies who are not exposed to good bacteria may be more likely to develop food allergies.
Studies have shown that some allergies may be linked to a baby not being exposed to enough beneficial bacteria within the first several weeks of life.
Also, probiotics may reduce the risk of developing atopic dermatitis or eczema for some babies.
If your doctor agrees, give your baby probiotics shortly after birth., A recent study has shown that babies given formula containing probiotics are at a decreased risk of developing diarrhea caused by infections or the use of antibiotics. This is important, as diarrhea can lead to dehydration and other medical problems.


Mix small amounts of probiotics into your baby’s formula.
Always follow the directions when providing supplements.
Consider cultured vegetable juice, kefir, or other supplements.
Probiotics probably decrease diarrhea because it introduces good bacteria, like lactobacillus plantarum, into a baby’s digestive tract."

AIOs are used just like disposables. Place them on the baby, and when they are wet or dirty, take them off and put them in the diaper pail.
AI2s and Pockets are used the same way as AIOs at diaper changing time, but require ""stuffing"" or ""snapping"" after being washed.
Prefolds and fitters  must be used with a cover, so they involve a two-step process of putting on the diaper and then putting on the cover at each diaper change.
Flat diapers are not widely available in the U.S., as they require extensive folding before each diaper change.;

Pros: As easy to use as disposables. Daycares and babysitters love them.
Cons: Take a long time to dry. Are often the bulkiest option. Cannot be customized to be extra absorbent. Most expensive.

Make sure the infant's clothing and bedding is all made of 100% cotton.,
Whoever is handling the baby should be dressed in all cotton as well.,
Nursing mothers should avoid or limit consuming foods and drinks that run high risk of allergies; search for those.,
Keep the infant in a dust free, smoke free, environment.,
Refrain from using air fresheners.,
Use mild laundry detergents to wash baby clothing; there are special products on the market shelves.,
Use infant friendly shampoos and soap.,
Pat dry a baby's body with a soft pure cotton cloth after a bath.,
Make sure whoever handles the infant is not wearing perfume.

,
Keep the infant cool or warm using your proper judgement.,
Treat colds naturally and rather quickly.,
Look for an alternative to chemical medication where possible after consulting a doctor.,
As the infant starts to eat, introduce vegetables first, one at a time.,
Honey was so controversial for babies, so introduce it after the first year of age.

,
Refrain from adding salt or sugar to baby food.

,
When taking an infant out in the open, check the weather and the forecast first, avoid crowds especially in closed or poorly ventilated places.

,


If not possible, a cotton blanket can be placed on the body parts of the handler that will be in touch with the baby. i.e a lap, shoulder, arm or chest.







, They should also consult a doctor before taking any medication because traces of it will run in the lactating milk.

, Use odorless cleansing detergents, preferably natural cleansers where possible. Ventilate often, but make sure the infant is not in a room with a draft.

, You may use natural potpourris for that. i.e citrus peels, vanilla pods or rose petals in simmering water.

, Perfumed detergents may cause nose and lung allergies. Residue of too much detergent will cause skin allergy.

, Clean the baby's bottom with running warm water instead of wet wipes when changing diapers or cleaning baby vomit.

, Use baby oil, calendula oil, or olive oil to moisten the baby skin if the weather is dry. Powder is not necessary but maybe helpful to keep the body dry in humid weather.

,, Too much warmth is just as bad as too much cold. A rule of thumb is, if it is cold or hot for you, it is so for the baby too.

, Long colds may turn to allergies affecting the nose and the lungs.

, For instance, fennel or anise tea are good alternatives when handling colic, flatulence, and constipation.

, For example, one may start with soft steamed peas, but keep feeding the same vegetable for two weeks before introducing squash or carrots. Should an allergy show from food, you will be able to find the allergen quicker. After a few vegetables have been introduced, fruits, then cereals may follow. Then mixtures of some of what was introduced earlier may follow.

Shake up the bottle of medicine.,
Draw the right amount of medication into the dropper syringe.,
Hold your baby in the crook of your elbow.,
Place the tip of the syringe dropper into their mouth.,
Squeeze in the medicine in increments.,
Feed your baby as normal.,
Talk to your pharmacist.",How to Give an Infant Medicine2," Most liquid medications should be shaken before dispensing; check the instructions to be certain., Many infant medication bottles have an opening designed to receive the tip of the included syringe. If so: depress the plunger of the syringe; push the syringe tip snugly into the opening of the bottle; turn the bottle upside down; and draw the instructed amount of medication into the syringe.If the bottle has an open top: depress the plunger; dip the tip of the syringe into the medication; pull on the plunger to draw up the correct amount of medication.
Draw the medication right up to (but not beyond) the instructed line.

, Make sure they are secure in your arm. Position them comfortably upright, so that their head is higher than their body.If the baby is fussing and flailing around, try swaddling them gently but securely in a blanket or towel.
Alternatively, have someone else hold the child securely while you give them the medicine.

, Aim for the space between the inside of one of their cheeks and their lower gumline. This will make swallowing easier and reduce the likelihood of gagging., Press a small amount of the liquid into the baby’s mouth, and wait for them to swallow it. Then repeat the process until the syringe is empty.Start small, and only increase the amount of medicine provided per push if the baby is swallowing it easily.

, This will help “wash down” the medicine, and remove any unpleasant taste. Of course, first be sure to check if the medicine should be taken with food, on an empty stomach, or between feedings. Ask your doctor beforehand about what to do if your baby spits out or spits up some of the medicine. Typically, you won’t be advised to draw up more medicine and try to give it to the baby.

, Talk to your pharmacist if you have trouble giving your baby oral medication, or if the infant seems to dislike the taste, won’t take it, or spits it out. See if he or she can custom flavor the medicine in order to mask the taste – some prescribers and compounding pharmacists can do this."

Tug on the earlobe gently.,
Push the plunger to put the correct number of drops into the ear.,
Repeat the process in the other ear, if needed.",How to Give an Infant Medicine3," Shake the bottle if indicated in the instructions. If the medication does not come in a bottle with an attached dropper, make sure to draw up the precise amount instructed into a syringe-style dropper.Typically, the closer to body temperature the ear drops are, the less jarring they will be for your baby. Consult the instructions and/or your doctor.
Wash your hands before and after preparing the medication.

, Swaddle them to keep them relatively still and calm. Hold them level, giving yourself clear access to an ear., This will give you better access to the ear canal. Place the tip of the dropper directly over the opening, next to but not touching the ear., Your baby might respond poorly to the sensation, so be prepared to hold them in place gently but securely. Drop the medication in fairly rapid succession, but not so quickly that you could lose count of the drops., Your infant may or may not need medicine placed in both ears. If they do, give the baby a moment to calm a bit — and also a few minutes for the medicine to drain down the ear canal. Then, turn them to the other side and do it all over again."

Try an alternate approach if necessary.",How to Give an Infant Medicine4," Wash your hands, shake up the bottle (if required), and draw up the exact amount of liquid medicine needed into a syringe-style dropper (if the bottle doesn't have a built-in dropper). Then wash your hands again. Do all this before you try to calm and secure your infant., Swaddle them as needed to provide a calming effect and restrict flailing limbs. Hold them level, with their head in the crook of your elbow., This will create a small pocket beneath the eye itself. This is your target zone for the drop., Let go of the eyelid and allow your baby to blink several times. This will spread the medication around the eye.For eye ointments, squeeze a strip (1 cm or as instructed) of the medicine along the inner edge of the pulled-back lower eyelid, then let go and allow the baby to blink.
In either case, get close but don’t permit the medication dispenser to touch the eye or eyelid.

, Wait a few moments for the baby to get a bit more composed and then apply another drop to the same eye if more than one is prescribed, or move on to the other eye, as instructed., If you’re struggling mightily with getting the drop into the lower eyelid pocket, you do have another option. Let the baby keep their eye closed. Squeeze one drop onto the inner corner of their eye (nearest their nose). From there, it will seep in between the eyelids. The baby will either open their eye, thereby circulating the medicine, or you can rub their closed eyelids gently.Check with your doctor to make sure this is an approved approach.

Wash your hands and put on a medical-grade glove.,
Warm and lubricate the suppository.,
Expose your baby’s undiapered bottom.,
Insert the suppository with your index finger.,
Hold the baby’s buttocks together for a couple of minutes.",How to Give an Infant Medicine5," Even if you’re used to dealing with nasty messes from your baby’s bottom with an ungloved hand, you are less likely to transmit germs this way. You’re also less likely to scrape their rectum with your fingernail — which would assuredly make the process even less pleasant all around., Roll the suppository around in your hands for a few moments; it will be more comfortable for your baby if it’s a bit softer and closer to body temperature. For additional comfort, rub a bit of lubricating jelly (or, in a pinch, lukewarm water) over the suppository.Don’t use petroleum jelly (e.g. Vaseline), which might begin to break down the suppository.

, Place them on a flat, steady, comfortable surface; their usual changing table / spot is a great choice. Lift their legs with one hand to expose and partially spread their buttocks., There is no exact science regarding how far to push it in, but the general rule of thumb is this: push it only far enough in that it won’t fall out.If you encounter an obstruction or unexpected resistance, stop and contact your doctor.
Suppositories usually have a flatter end and a more rounded end. The rounded end usually goes in first, but your doctor might recommend the opposite to help keep the suppository in place.

, Only gentle pressure is needed. In the meantime, comfort and/or distract your baby from the unusual sensation caused by the suppository.Make sure to put a diaper on your infant before too long, or you may end up with a giant mess!

"
"
Decide whether you prefer disposable or reusable wipes.,
Read ingredient lists and select disposable wipes that are free of alcohol or fragrance if your baby has sensitive skin or is a newborn.,
Look for wipes that are labeled ""thick"" if you prefer a more substantial wipe.

,
Choose specific types of packaging if it is important to you.,
Compare sizes and determine which quantity will offer the most value or convenience.",How to Buy Baby Wipes,"


Disposable wipes are more sanitary and convenient, but reusable wipes are more economical and environmentally friendly. Some babies have allergic reactions to disposable infant wipes, making reusable products the only option.
Buy reusable baby wipes at most organic baby boutiques, or cut squares of organic cotton or flannel fabric.
Reusable wipes or cotton balls are recommended in the first weeks of the infant's life, since the skin is very sensitive immediately following birth.;
,


Hypoallergenic wipes may be an option if your child cannot tolerate traditional disposable wipes.

Wipes are usually sold in reusable tubs, zipper bags or travel packs with or without lids. If the wipes you want aren't available in your preferred packaging you can transfer them to your own zipper bag, travel case or recycled wipes tub. Packaging may be decorated with colorful designs or characters, so your purchase decision may be influenced by how the wipes will look in your baby's nursery.

,


If a brand is new to you, purchase a trial packet or a small tub of about 60 wipes. If you know the brand works well for your child, purchase a large pack of about 200 wipes. Some stores carry large value boxes that may contain up to 1,000 wipes. A large quantity is not necessarily the best value, so if you are looking for cost savings, calculate and compare prices per wipe.

Give yourself a treat.",How to Pack a Diaper Bag," The type of diaper bag you use will depend on what you expect from it. For short trips lasting anywhere from a half hour to a few hours, a smaller bag will be fine; but for longer trips, including car travel, camping, and visiting the in-laws, a larger bag is a must. When purchasing a diaper bag, check for such features as:


Easy-to-access pockets, plenty of them for various items
Thermally lined pockets to keep food and drink warm or cool
Special compartment for diapers and change mat
Comfortable handles or straps for carrying or wearing - try the bag on in the store to see if it feels right for you
Ability to fit over the stroller or pram - this will take the weight off you and makes it easy to access.
Suitable for your aesthetics. Sure, it is not the most important feature, but it is a fashion accessory. If you like how your diaper bag looks, the happier you will be with it.
Men might prefer not to lug around a diaper bag that is very overtly feminine: flowery, bright pink, emblazoned with ""princess"" and so on. Plenty of diaper bags come in gender-neutral patterns, or plain solids that look entirely masculine.
Many parents prefer diaper bags that look like a backpack or courier bag.;
, If you are not breastfeeding, (and often even if you are) food and drinks should always be packed. Most often times, there will be a circular pocket in the very front of the bag to place the bottle in (bottom edge first; so the nipple portion stays upright). If you are bottle feeding, use a travel container that divides each powder amount and spare travel-sized bottles of water or juice. If your baby is on solids, choose small travel jars that you can throw out when finished. Breastfeeders must either express some milk for travel for a day or so or not bother with stashing a bottle and feed on the run (as what should be natural after a month or two).

, Diapers are essential to keep in stock in a diaper bag. Although the quantity of diapers you need won't depend on the type of diapers, the length of the trip will be a big factor. You might need to stock up on several diapers for longer trips and only a couple diapers for shorter trips. Have at least one diaper for each hour you plan to be out. Also, try to get a travel pack of baby wipes, as well as a tube of diaper rash cream (such as Desitin) inside of a Ziploc re-closable bag. Most often times, you can stack these diapers sideways starting at one side of the bag and layer the remainder of the bag, or pack these on a secondary outside pouch (if available). For those parents of cloth-diaper wearers, prepare to take an extra set or two of diaper pins with you, which can be included in the Ziploc bag containing the diaper rash cream and baby wipes or stuck onto the arm straps.


If there is a medium-sized pocket on the outside of the bag, stick a diaper or two in there to grab at first then take the diapers from the bag if necessary.
If you keep both diapers and baby food in your diaper bag, make sure to keep the clean diapers hygienic. Place them inside of a clean larger-size Ziploc bag. Plus, if only one diaper is inside the bag, each Ziploc can be used as a ""dirty"" bag and hold the used diaper. Diapers can be stacked inside the main compartment of the bag

, These could even be spread lengthwise in the main compartment of the bag. It's good to have a changing pad (either disposable or plastic) for those times when there isn't a restroom around. Some restaurants won't have a baby changing station, (the plastic changing table usually mounted on the wall). Having your own plan is better than guessing whether something is available or not.

, Use the side pockets or little compartments for medications, emergency phone numbers, etc. Add a tube of teething gel (Oragel® or similar) or a teething ring, and infant Tylenol® (pain relief for infants) - these are both excellent items to leave in the bag. Finally, some tissues are always handy to have in the bag. For older children, you might want to add a tube of antiseptic cream (such as Neosporin) and some adhesive strips (Band-Aids) to the essential items used.

, Have extra blankets on hand and available inside the diaper bag. Although most parents keep a receiving blanket-styled blanket for cooler trips and even for some trips where it could turn to be too cool for baby but too warm for just their layer of clothing, many parents try to pack for the weather. A good sized blanket is appropriate for a cool environment., Clothing must be folded- each one individually. You may also want to keep an extra sweatshirt or sweater just for those times when the weather changes drastically. You don't need to over pack these things; if it's just for a walk in the park, you probably don't need to pack clothes. However, do not pack a second supply of jackets (unless the jackets are thin, but these could meant for springtime weather.)


Look into bringing along extra feeding supplies. Let's face it: Babies are picky eaters. Bring along a bib or two is excellent for feeding times.

, Bring a toy or two and a favorite hard cover book. The smaller the toy the better, though if you can, remember their favorite plush toys to take unless you aren't planning to go for too long.


Pack a pacifier, if you don't generally keep your children entertained with too many toys when in the car. Pacifiers can be tucked away inside a Ziploc bag which can be kept on an outside pocket that isn't being used for diapers. If there aren't enough empty spots in the bag for everything, you may need to poke a cloth diaper diaper-pin around the ring then along the arm-strap of the bag so you can rather quickly grab just one.

, Put these in their own separate plastic re-closable bag which can be snuck into the diaper bag in a secondary pocket or in the second side of the main compartment of the bag. Anti-bacterial hand sanitizer gel can be a lifesaver when there isn't a sink nearby. Sanitary or antibacterial wipes can help clean off a restaurant highchair, the handle of the grocery car, or the restroom changing table where you plan to change your baby's diaper.

, Whether a reused grocery bag, or a snap lock bag, you'll need these spare bags constantly for putting dirty bibs and clothes in, or a soiled diaper. Don't ever forget these necessities when leaving, no matter how long you plan to be gone, and be sure to stock up each time you leave the house with your diaper bag and child in hand. Ziplocs aren't a great choice; these bags shouldn't ever be a close-to-sanitary option as they will be used and thrown away soon after you turn to find a trash can.

, Pack a little snack for yourself, drop your wallet in, and anything else that will make you happy on your trip, such as a favorite novel, or a note pad for jotting down poems and drop these inside the top of the diaper bag. Take along a camera (which you can gently place above the clothing you took) just in case you see something you'd love to photograph, especially your baby doing something cute."

Don't wait for the baby to awaken, if forced to complete a diaper change during the night.,
Stabilize the temperature in the room to the same temperature as what the baby is most comfortable to on the outside of their diaper.,
Don't talk or interact in any way with the child.,
Don't use the Ankle-Hold method.,
Don't supply yourself with any external lighting near the baby's changing area.,
Don't wait until your child's diaper is so super-soaked during the night, that you must change it during the night itself.,
Use cloth diapers on your child as opposed to disposables.,
Don't use store-brand disposable diapers, unless you are mandated to choose the disposable diaper route.,
Don't allow the smell of the older dirty diapers or any other unnatural scent the baby might not be used to, penetrate through the air.,
Provide them with distracting toys and objects (perhaps plush or ones that don't make noise), if they have awakened.

",How to Change a Baby's Diaper (Without Them Realizing You're Doing So),";
, Temperature changes can be a big reason why the baby will awaken. If the air is too cold, or the air is too warm, are two main factors that play a part.

, The more communication that goes on with your child, the more they'll react, and the better chance that they will awaken during the change.

, Instead, slide the diaper underneath the baby's rear end as if it was a pull-up styled diaper. It may not look that great, but given all other factors, it's better than leaving your child in wet diapers and exposing their skin to diaper rashes that cause greater pain.

, Unless you are using natural lighting in the area, don't use other sources of interior light, as bright lights can bring the baby to an ""awake"" stage.

, Periodically check the child's diaper during the night to make sure this delayed stage isn't the case.

, Cloth diapers won't creak and make sounds that can awaken the child (unlike that of disposables). Yes, the rubber pant may make some noise, but with some practice, you can actually get around this and not allow it to make any noise during the change.

, Store-brand disposable diapers always seem to make unnatural sounds that may awaken the baby. Popular brand name diapers work best, and don't seem to creek as much as those people using store-brand diapers.

,


Lavender and chamomile smells aren't a problem in many situations. These scents can be used to effectively calm the baby and still keep the diaper-changing problem from even being noticed, both during the daytime and during nighttime situations.

Keep floors and low surfaces free of small objects.,
Secure electrical cords.,
Cover all electrical outlets.,
Make the floor softer.,
Place corner covers or bumpers on the sharp edges of all furniture.,
Secure bookcases and other tall furniture to the wall.,
Keep drawers closed and secure.,
Secure windows and window treatments.,
Secure door handles and locks.,
Secure your screen or storm door.,
Place a guard or barrier around fireplaces, space heaters, and radiators.,
Verify whether any household plants are poisonous.,
Place breakable items on high shelves.",How to Child Proof a Living Room," If your baby can fit something in his mouth, there is a chance he could choke on it. Make sure any small objects are kept up off the floor and out of your baby’s reach.


Regularly vacuum your living room floor to pick up any small items you might not notice visually. Even items like deflated latex balloons or forgotten paperclips could lead to a choking hazard if they are left on the floor for your baby to find and ingest.Make sure you inspect your baby’s toys regularly. Small pieces may fall off and become choking hazards. If you notice small pieces from a toy on the floor, discard that toy and the broken pieces immediately.
Move furniture to pick up small objects and vacuum. Your baby could reach under and find things you may have missed. Things like old batteries, loose paper, and buttons from the remote might have found their way behind or under the furniture.;
, Use zip ties, velcro, or cord straps to tie up all long cords and secure them out of your baby’s reach. If these cords remain on the floor, your baby might become entangled in them or pull on them.Wrap excess cord length and secure it with a zip tie. Then, hook the cord to the wall using a Command hook. Just make sure you hook the cord high enough that your baby won’t be able to reach it to pull it down.
To best keep your baby from pulling on electrical cords, you should move furniture in front of the cords and the outlets they plug into. This will block access to the cord and the outlet all at once.

, There are many different options for covering your outlets, including moving furniture in front of them. But, if rearranging furniture isn’t an option, you can use other methods.Use plastic outlet covers in all outlets. You can buy these at just about any grocery or department store. They are made of plastic, plug right into the outlet, and are difficult for your baby to grip and pull out because they lie flat against the outlet.
You can install baby-safe electrical outlet plates over your existing outlets to prevent your baby from getting to them. They clip right over your original cover. To use the outlet, just put the prongs in place, slide the cover to the side, and plug your cord in. These might be more visually appealing than plastic covers, and you would be less likely to lose them or forget to put them back in after using the outlet.

, If you have hard floors, your baby will need a softer place to sit and play. You can use anything from baby play mats to area rugs to soften the floor for your baby. You could even go a more permanent route and install new carpeting.


Playmats and gyms are great for babies of many different ages and developmental stages. They come in many different styles and sizes, and offer your baby a soft place to lie down and play, as well as built in entertainment like toys, lights, and music to engage your baby and keep him or her happy.If you decide to go with an area rug or carpeting, choose something in a darker shade. Babies and young children are prone to messes like spills and accidents, so a darker colored rug would allow you to better mask stubborn stains and leftover messes., These can be purchased in the baby care aisle of your local big box store. They come in many different styles and colors, and are easily applied and later removed when your child is older.


Some of these even come in fun shapes, like animals or cartoon characters. Depending on how much you want to give up your own personal design style for your kids, you might consider these to make them more fun.
Make sure you purchase enough of these for all sharp corners and edges in your living room. This includes coffee tables, end tables, TV stands, shorter bookcases or shelving units, benches, and chairs.

, Babies tend to climb or pull on furniture, and with that comes a risk of that furniture falling over on them and hurting them. Newer furniture often comes with kits to secure the piece to the wall, or these kits can be purchased at hardware stores.


You can also buy furniture straps to secure your end tables and bookcases to the wall. These straps are easy to apply and use, and are durable and reliable. They are also easily removed or released if you want to redecorate or rearrange your furniture., If you have any furniture in your living room that has drawers, make sure you keep them closed. Use straps or locks to keep your child from pulling these drawers out.


Think about the things you often keep in drawers: remotes, items with small pieces, fragile items, candles, and even sharp objects or lighters. You want to make sure your baby does not have access to these items.Your baby could potentially pull the drawers out and use them as a ladder to climb higher, resulting in injury. Keeping drawers closed and secure prevents this.
One of the best methods to secure drawers in your living room is with easily installed magnetic locks. These kits often come with multiple locks and a single key. They are easily disabled (by you) when you need to get into the drawer, and won’t allow your child to open the drawer even a crack, which could get her fingers caught., Regardless of how low to the ground your windows go, as your baby grows, he might be able to reach the latch of the window. You want to make sure your windows are secure, as well as the draperies and blinds that you have on your windows.Depending on the type of windows you have, your method of babyproofing them will differ. For example if you have sliding windows, or windows that slide to the left or right to open, you will want to put a bar in your window track to prevent the window from sliding open. Or, if you have hung windows that push up to open, you will want to make sure they stay in the locked position, and that the locks are secure.Wrap up and secure all cords hanging from things like blinds and draperies. These cords are dangerous for your child, as they could become entangled in them. Use zip ties and Command hooks to wind up excess cord lengths and hang them out of reach.Choose cordless window coverings when you can.
Replace the glass in your windows with shatterproof glass, or use shatterproof linings like tempered glass or films to keep glass from shattering and harming your baby should it break.
Install window guards to make sure your child cannot fall out of the window. These guards are essentially bars that will allow you to open your windows and let air in without worrying about your child falling out.

, Since the living room is often also where the front door is, you want to make sure that your growing baby or toddler cannot open the door. She could get her fingers caught in the door, or even get out of the house if handles and locks are not secure.


There are many options for securing doors in your home to keep your baby from getting injured, or from entering rooms they aren’t allowed in. One option is called a “Door Monkey,” which is a gadget that allows air to still move between rooms through a small gap in the door, but keeps the door from opening or closing any further.Use a cover on deadbolts to keep your baby or growing toddler from unlocking them. These are available in the baby care aisle of most stores.
Door knob covers prevent your child from turning round door knobs. Alternatively, you can simply close the door with a washcloth in the jamb, and your child will not be able to open it. As you close the door, place a washcloth between the door and the frame, and close the door on the cloth. This will keep the door in place should your child try to push it open, but you will be able to open it yourself with a little push and pulling the washcloth tight.

, If you have a screen door, use a metal mesh or grill on the bottom half to keep your baby from falling through or pushing the screen out. Screens are not particularly sturdy or safe, so using a metal grill over the lower portion can reinforce it.


You can purchase these at your local hardware or home improvement store. They often clip right into your existing screen door and will allow you to keep air flowing in while still keeping your child safe.
There are also companies that will install special types of doors. Many companies have the option for a door that comes equipped with a metal grill on the lower half of the screen.

, Even if these devices are not in use, they could pose a danger to your child, so you want to make sure you keep them secure.


There are many ways to cover your fireplace. One more stylish way to babyproof a fireplace is to cover it with a panel you have painted with chalkboard paint. You could also fill it with books for decoration, or cover it with a piece of sheet metal.If you want to leave your fireplace functional while still protecting your child from it, you will want to install a gate with a wide girth that will keep your child away from both the hearth and the fire while the fireplace is in use.
Radiator covers can help keep your child’s hands away from a hot radiator while it is in use, and keep him from getting his hands stuck in it if it’s off. You can buy radiator covers in a variety of styles, or even make your own., If you have plants in your living room, you will want to make sure they can’t be harmful to your child. Your child could potentially become poisoned by eating soil from the pot, ingesting leaves or blossoms, or even from simply touching the plant.Even some of the most common household plants can be harmful to your child. Pothos, Peace Lily, and Caladium plants are all highly toxic to children, and even pets. If you have any of these in your living room, make sure you put them out of reach.
Swapping live plants out for plastic plants is an option, but even plastic plants pose their threats. Children could pull off leaves or small pieces, which are choking hazards. It is best to keep all plants, real or fake, out of reach.

, Items that are expensive or easily broken should always be kept out of reach from your baby or young toddler. She can easily do damage to both the object and herself should she get ahold of it.You might usually keep things like vases, decorative items, or even remote controls on your coffee and end tables. Move these items to higher shelves and out of reach of your child. They could potentially cause harm if they are broken, or if small pieces are ingested.
You can even try installing high, floating shelves to place these items on. This is a stylish alternative to putting your decorative items away until your child is older."

Enrich their hearing with soft toys that create different noises, for example small stuffed animals with bells inside of them, soft rattles with soft handles, or a small squeaky animal.;
, This is the cheapest and most efficient toy to give to a baby. If you can't find one, you can use a padded blanket for the baby to play on. If you choose blankets, you'll need to watch closely and to place the baby in a crib when they go to sleep. Play mats give the baby the opportunity to lie on a soft surface and play with toys. As the months go by, it will also give them the opportunity to have room to roll over and crawl on.

, Babies love to look at things, especially a close-up of themselves. Attach a mirror on their play mat for more entertainment.

, Make your baby feel comfortable that there's still ""friends"" (toys) with him/her while they go to sleep. The soothing music creates an extra security blanket.

If your baby is walking, you may want to go with shoes with hard soles, but yet light-weight and flexible.,

, Socks or soft booties will be enough to protect from the elements.

, Have your child try on the shoes and stand up. There should be just enough room to squeeze your pinky between your child's heel and the heel of the shoe, and a full thumb-width between the end of your child's longest toe and the front of the shoe.

, Usually a child will outgrow a shoe in 3-6 months. Never buy a shoe that is too large just to make it last longer as they will be very uncomfortable for a new walker (or anybody for that matter). Instead look for lower cost options of the correct size so you can switch them out at the right time.

,, Similarly, in hot and humid areas, go for open-faced sandals to allow the feet to breathe.

Support your baby’s head.,
Don’t worry too much about the soft spot.,
Don’t ever shake your baby.",How to Care for Your New Baby1," When you pick your baby up, be sure that you are supporting the head and neck. Babies have little muscle development in this area and if they do not have support when lifted, they can become seriously injured. Lift them delicately and cradle their head as you do so.;
, Babies skulls will not fully close until they are roughly a year and a half to two years old.Until then, you will notice that there are soft spots on their head. Don’t worry too much, however. The membrane that covers these spots is very tough and your baby will be perfectly safe. You can touch these areas or comb the baby’s hair without causing any harm.

, Do not, under any circumstances, shake your baby. This will easily cause serious brain damage, spinal damage, or even kill your baby. You should not even shake them as a part of play until they have developed the muscles necessary to support this.


If you are angry with your baby (which may very well happen, they cry a lot) and you are concerned that you feel the need to shake the baby or do something violent to make it be quiet, please seek help. Ask a friend or parent to watch the baby or give you advice until you calm down. Sleep deprivation is a harsh mistress.

Understand when to feed your baby.,
Be conscious of what to feed your baby.,
Know how to feed your baby.,
Prepare for spit up.,
Burp your baby.After your baby has eaten, you will want to burp them.,
Watch out for gas.",How to Care for Your New Baby2," Your baby will generally let you know when they need to be fed. Expect crying. With time you may come to be able to hear the difference between the cries and know which means hunger and which means bedtime and so on. How often they eat will depend on what they are eating, how much of it they are eating, and their own individual metabolism.


Older babies will often give an indication when they are hungry, such as hand movements.

, Infants will need to drink milk, either from formula or breast milk. Try not to give them anything other than this, as it will likely make them sick or lead them to choke. They can eat baby food once they reach a few months old and as they start to get teeth you can introduce more solid foods.


Breast milk has been shown to be much healthier for your baby than formula, as it will provide not only the nutrients your baby needs but will also temporarily pass on many of your immunities to your baby., You will need to choose between bottles or breastfeeding. No matter which method you choose, you will need to ensure that you are doing it correctly in order to prevent your baby from getting an infection and to help decrease the likelihood of spitting up.

If bottle feeding, you will need to decide between a variety of bottle types. You may wish to purchase simple, more cost-effective bottles or you may wish to purchase more complex ones. Bottle liners can be purchased if you want to reduce the amount of washing you’ll be doing, but you’ll make more garbage in exchange.

Breastfeeding is incredibly simple. Women were born to do it, after all! Be sure that you are keeping your nipple clean and free of any infections. Consult with your doctor if you are taking any medications and check labels on over-the-counter drugs. You will also want to eat as healthfully as possible, since you will be sharing those nutrients with your baby!
While there are a variety of acceptable feeding positions for either method, you may want to feed with the baby in an upright position, as this will help prevent spit up.

, Babies stomach muscles are very weak in the beginning. So weak that sometimes they have a hard time keeping food in there! Don’t worry, this is very normal...it’s just messy. Prepare for spit up by always having rags handy in order to clean up the mess, keeping a bib on your baby when they’re a little bigger, and generally having a rag placed in front of your mouth any time you intend to burp them or move them around soon after eating.


You will want to watch for spit up that is a color other than white or clear (red, yellow, green, and brown, for example) as these can be signs of illness. If you see this, take the baby to the doctor. Similarly, spitting up very forcefully or your baby not gaining weight are signs that would warrant a doctor’s visit.

, They can easily swallow too much air while eating and the bubbles in their stomach will make them cranky and uncomfortable. Lay your baby so that they are slightly over your shoulder and then firmly pat their back. This will help release the air and make your baby very happy.

, If your baby seems very unhappy and you cannot find any other cause, they are likely gassy. Help them to work the gas out of their system by laying them across your lap on their stomach and with their butt slightly elevated. Pat their back and draw your hand downward to help work the gas out; gravity will do most of the work.

Know when to change your baby’s diaper.,
Understand how to change your baby’s diaper.,
Combat diaper rash.,
Bathe your baby.,
Don’t forget to brush “teeth”.",How to Care for Your New Baby3," This part won’t be too hard. If your baby’s diaper is filled, change it! If your baby’s diaper is wet, change it! A soiled diaper will smell, so it won’t be hard to tell when it’s time for a change. Wet diapers can be a little more challenging. Set a timer and be sure to at least check their diaper every two hours. If you notice it is wet before then, however, change it then.


A baby should never be left in a soiled diaper for long, as this can lead to a wide range of health problems. Plus, it isn’t very sanitary for you! Very full diapers will leak and you probably don’t want poop in your carpets.

, Diaper changing is very simple but if done incorrectly many problems can occur. Leaks, chafing, and pinching can result from an improperly placed diaper.Follow a few simple guidelines to be sure that you are keeping yourself clean and your baby happy.


Place your baby on the changing area, flat on their back. Do not leave them unattended in this area for any period of time and try to always have at least one hand on them to keep them from rolling away.
Open the soiled diaper but do not take it all the way off.
Clean your baby thoroughly with the appropriate wet wipes. Do this similarly to how you would clean yourself.
Place the dirty wipes in the diaper and then, lifting the baby’s lower body up by the ankles, slide it out from under them. Roll it up and throw it away.
Take out a fresh diaper, open it completely, and then slide it into position. Be sure that it is facing the correct direction.
Close the diaper and check that the elastic around the legs is properly fit and is not too tight or pinching your baby.

, Diaper rash is a common skin irritation that results when the baby’s skin cannot get dry, is rubbed too hard by the diaper, or when your baby has other health problems. It is often a result of not being changed enough or wearing a diaper that is too small, though it is easy to get diaper rashes and you should not feel bad if your baby gets one.Combat diaper rash with the appropriate creams or powders when changing your baby’s diaper and change their diaper as soon as it is soiled.
Make sure that diapers and your baby’s clothing fit, watch for dietary or product changes (as your baby may have an allergy), and be aware that antibiotics can make your baby susceptible to diaper rash. Seek help if the rash has not healed in a few days.

, Babies do not sweat like adults and so will not have to be bathed as often. Give them a bath once a week or after a particularly bad diaper. Use products that are labeled for babies and bathe them in a sink or baby bath. Never leave them unattended when they are in the water.Sponge bathe infants until their umbilical cord has fallen off and any circumcision is healed.

, Babies may not have teeth, but once they are a few months old you may want to start them brushing anyway. This will stimulate their gums and can help encourage teething.Get baby toothbrushes, which are basically rubber brushes, and gently brush their gums once every few days.

Be aware of when your baby sleeps.,
Know how to put your baby to sleep.,
Understand swaddling.,
Avoiding SIDS.",How to Care for Your New Baby4," Babies do sleep a lot but not for very long periods of time. Each child will have it’s own natural sleep rhythm which you will learn with time. Try to accommodate it and plan your own sleep schedule as much as you can.

, Your baby may need help falling asleep, so know some basic ways to help your baby. You can hold your baby in your arms or up on your shoulder and either walk with them or rock them in a chair. Babies respond well to repetitive sounds, so make cooing sounds or you can sing them a lullaby.

, Swaddling is a method of wrapping up a baby in a blanket so that they don’t move. While it might seem strange to an adult, it is extremely comforting for a baby as it makes them feel secure. It will also keep them from surprising themselves if they move in their sleep. Watch the video below to learn how to swaddle your baby.

, SIDS, or sudden infant death syndrome, is a very mysterious condition which you will want to protect against. No one particularly understands what causes it and some question whether it exists at all, but there are a few practices which seem to be related to the deaths. Avoid these and your baby should be fine:


Protect your baby by always putting them to sleep on their back
Don’t put a pacifier into your baby’s mouth
Use a firm mattress in your baby’s crib
Remove soft or fluffy bedding and stuffed animals

"
"
Sit your baby in infant swings and seats.,
Let your baby play with toys.,
Sing to your baby.,
Read with your baby.,
Socialize your baby.",How to Care for Your New Baby5," These will allow your baby to see the action going on around them, as well as a comfortable place to fall asleep if they get tired during the day. Try to get seats which bounce in response to your child’s movement and swings that can swing themselves. These will help keep baby entertained while you get things done. Just don’t leave them unattended!

, Once babies are old enough to hold objects, you can give them toys to play with. Get age appropriate toys that they can put in their mouths, as this is baby’s favorite way to play! Toys that make sounds or have lights are particularly fun for your baby.


It is easy to make many toys that your baby can play from objects you find around the house. You do not need to spend a lot of money. For example, you can tie a bunch of plastic bags into a clean sock so that you have a soft ball which crinkled when you squish it. Baby will be fascinated!

, Sing your baby lots of songs. This will make them very happy, help the two of you bond, and will also help their brains develop. Sing songs that you like or children’s songs that you know! You will create memories to last a lifetime if you choose a song that is just for the two of you.

, Read your baby lots of books. This will accommodate them to the idea of reading early on and will help their brains develop by exposing them to the rhythm and sounds of language. Make your reading entertaining by moving your hands across the page and using your “exciting” voice.

, Your baby will need to spend time around other children of a similar and different age. This will help your child learn to interact and be around others. Set up play-dates so that your baby gets to spend playtime with a friend. Play with others in small groups. Your baby will become easily overwhelmed unless they are naturally very, very social so try to schedule play-dates with only one or two other children at a time.
Let your baby watch you socialize. Your baby will learn a lot by watching you interact with your friends and other children. Relax while you are around other people, as your baby can pick up on your tension and may feel that other people should be feared. Be friendly and open and smile as you talk with other people. Hug them when it is appropriate. Your baby will learn that this is how we interact with others.
Don’t be too protective. Your baby should be allowed to get into arguments with their friends. Even a little physical fighting is not unexpected. Try to let your baby sort these things out on their own, as this is how they learn to interact with other people. If you pick them up at the slightest sign of trouble then they will never learn.

Don’t stress about cradle cap.,

Deal with thrush.",How to Care for Your New Baby6," Cradle cap is a skin condition that is very normal for newborns. This will look like a scaly, yellow or white series of patches on their skin. It is not a serious condition and should resolve itself in a few months. If it seems overly severe, talk to your doctor.

, Colds are normal in small children and should not be a cause for concern. Usually they will go away from two weeks. However, if your child is younger than 2-3 months, go to doctor as this can result in more serious health conditions., Thrush is an oral yeast infection, usually a result of taking antibiotics. It will appear as whitish patches in and around the mouth or cracks at the corners of the mouth. Prevent thrush by keeping bottles and pacifiers clean. Though it is not a terribly threatening illness, if your child contracts thrush you should talk to your doctor to get the appropriate creams to treat the problem."
"
Get a car seat.,
Use a stroller or baby carrying wrap.,
Be careful where you take your newborn.",How to Care for Your New Baby7," You will need to get a car seat before your baby is born, as one will be necessary to take your new baby home. Be sure to always use a car seat which is appropriate for the age and weight of your child. Rear-facing car seats are the safest and should be used until your child is at least 1 year old.

, You will want a method to carry your baby while you are shopping or out walking around. You can get a stroller and push them or, if you want to save space, carry your baby in a carrying wrap. These are perfectly comfortable for both of you and will also help you bond.

, Newborns have very weak immune systems and should be exposed to as little illness as possible. Do not take them to very crowded or dirty places, avoid other children’s birthday parties, and encourage others to touch the baby only on their feet (rather than the face or hands) to keep illness from spreading.

Give your baby positive reinforcement once you have dressed your baby.",How to Change a Squirmy Baby's Clothes," Young babies cannot tell us what is bothering them. They communicate with body language, including squirming.


If your baby is particularly squirmy, he or she may be trying to tell you something.;
, For younger babies, it may be because they are hungry, gassy, or tired. A young baby who tugs at their mouth or makes sucking faces is probably hungry, but if they rub their eyes they are often tired.


Older babies are more able to show or tell you their discomfort, but they still follow many of the basic cues of young infants. Knowing your baby’s individual cues and schedule can help you know how to best meet their needs.

, Once you have determined at least one reason why your baby is squirming, do what you can to alleviate that discomfort. This may mean feeding or burping your baby, or waiting until after a nap to change their clothes.


Starting with a baby who is as comfortable and content as possible will help the entire clothes changing process. Of course some babies just love to move and will always be squirmy, in which case you just need to be patient and prepared.

, Your baby may squirm because he or she is hungry. Unless a dirty diaper must be changed, consider feeding your baby before you try to change him or her.

, Your baby may be uncomfortably cold during changes. If the room is chilly, or if your baby has just come out of a warm bath, this problem could be exacerbated.


If possible, give your baby some time to adjust to the temperature before removing his or her clothing.

, Clothing manufacturers try to increase their profits by making baby clothes as cute as possible. Unfortunately, cuteness does not always equate with comfort. Lace collars, elastic cuffs, and stiff material can irritate your baby and cause excess squirming.


If your baby seems to squirm most when you dress him or her in particular outfits, those outfits, and the material they are made of, could be your problem.

, If you have a changing table, it may be the best bet for safely dressing a squirmy baby – it will keep your baby at a comfortable height and allow you to keep supplies handy. Put your elbows on the table, and use your forearms to control your baby’s movements while you change and dress him or her.


If you are not vigilant, an active baby can fall from the changing table. Use one hand to hold your baby in place at all times, and pay attention – you may need to react quickly. Never leave your baby on the changing table, whether it has a safety strap or not. If you need to get supplies, take your baby with you.

, A bed can be a great surface for changing a baby’s clothes – it’s soft, roomy, and not as high as the changing table. Make sure everything you might need is on hand.


If you are also changing your baby’s diaper, protect the bedclothes by placing your baby on a towel.

, One of the simplest and safest ways to change an active baby is to change your baby on the floor. Let your baby roll around a little, then dress him or her as usual. If you will also be changing your baby’s diaper, you might want to protect your carpet by spreading a towel or sheet out.


If your baby is extremely active, you might have to stretch an arm or a leg across his or her stomach in order to complete the change.

, If you do not need to change your baby’s diaper, you can also try holding him or her in your lap. It can be much easier to control a baby’s movements this way. To change your baby on your lap:


Simply sit your baby in your lap, wrap one hand around him or her, and use your knees for extra control. Then change your baby’s clothes as you normally would.

, Always remember to keep your eyes on your child, regardless of where you decide to change your baby.


Follow basic baby safety rules and avoid putting anything dangerous, such as blind pulls, electric outlets, or small items, in the changing area and within your baby’s reach.

, The best choices for active babies are those that must be held with two hands. That way, you will only have to fight with your baby’s legs – his or her arms will be occupied.


It’s generally a good idea to keep a second and third toy available, because squirmy babies will often tire of the first toy while you are still struggling to change them.

, Some babies prefer to imitate you. Offer your baby a clean diaper or the package of wipes to hold while you get him or her changed.

, Mobiles hung on the ceiling work well for small babies because it gives them something new and interesting to look at while you change them.


Rotating mobiles and mobiles that make sounds are especially distracting.

, If you are desperate to keep your baby still during changes, think about allowing him or her to hold something that would ordinarily be off limits. For example, let your baby hold your phone during changes.

, Sing songs, make funny faces, or just talk to your baby. You may be able to keep his or her attention long enough to complete the change.


Try blowing bubbles or even tickling your baby in an effort to keep their attention on you.

, For extremely fussy babies, enlist the help of a spouse or family member to distract and restrain the baby while you change their diaper and clothes.


An older child can also help in the process by keeping the baby occupied while you get them changed.

, To minimize the stress and amount of time it takes to change a squirmy baby, have everything ready before you begin. Gather all of the changing supplies, such as:


A clean diaper, wipes, cream, clean clothes, socks, and shoes.
It can be helpful to keep all diaper changing essentials in a basket to transport to the changing area so you never forget an important component. Keep toys and other items to distract your baby within arm’s reach.

, Take a fresh diaper, open it, and set it near the changing surface. It’s best to do this before you begin undressing your baby.


Doing this will help to keep your baby from rolling or wiggling while you are trying to get set up.

, Place your diapered baby on the changing surface, and, with one hand, grasp his or her legs at the ankles. This way, you’ll have his or her legs under control while you change the diaper.

, Using your free hand, unfasten and remove the old diaper. Move the dirty diaper away from the changing area to avoid it getting kicked by a squirmy baby and making a larger mess.

, Using diaper wipes, clean up your baby before you replace the diaper.

, Keeping one hand around your baby’s ankles, use the other hand to place a clean diaper under your baby’s bottom.

, As quickly as possible, fasten the diaper. It might be easiest to hold your baby’s stomach with one hand and fasten the diaper with the other.


If you are using the floor as your changing surface, you can also keep your baby still with your leg.

, If you know your baby is squirmy and difficult to change, plan their wardrobe accordingly. Clothing with lots of snaps and buttons takes longer to put on and is more difficult with a squirmy baby.


Look for simple shirts and pants, shorts, or skirts with elastic waistband.

, Before you begin changing your baby, put a set of clean clothes nearby. That way, they will be within reach as you struggle to keep your baby still.

, If the outfit is made of more than one piece, start with the shirt. Spread the neck opening with your fingers, and gently pull it over your baby’s head with your hands still inside. If your baby tries to roll, follow his or her movements. Then insert your baby’s arms one at a time, bending them at the elbows and then pulling them through the sleeves.


Try to keep a hand or forearm on your baby’s torso at all times. This will keep him or her still long enough for you to get the shirt on. If your baby does roll or wriggle, try to follow his or her movements.

, Wrinkle one pant leg, bend your baby’s leg at the knees, and then push the pant leg over. Repeat with the second leg. Hold onto your baby as best you can with your hands or forearms.

, Choose clothing wisely. If you have a very squirmy baby, it can help to choose one-piece outfits that button up the front. That way, you can easily open the buttons, place your baby on top of the clothing, thread the baby’s hands through the sleeves, and then pull your baby’s legs through the leg openings. Then fasten the buttons.


In general, it’s better to button or buckle the clothes from the bottom up. Baby clothing is often designed so that the legs come out easily for diaper changes. Once you button the bottom part, it will be easier to button the middle.

, If you have an extremely wiggly baby, you may not be able to get all the buttons and snaps done correctly all at once. Just fasten enough of the outfit so that it stays in place. You can finish it later, when your baby is calmer.

, If your baby wears shoes, find shoes that are slip on or elastic instead of laces that require tying and take up valuable wiggle time.

, After the diaper and clothes change is complete, give your baby a hug and some attention to remind them that changes aren’t that bad. Rewarding them for good behavior with physical touch may help babies get over their squirminess.

Take the initiative.,
Check recalls.gov or similar government websites.,
Search via child care and safety websites.,
Check the news.,
Register your products.,
Confirm the recall details.,
Follow the recall instructions.,
Disclose when a product is under recall.,
Weigh your options if you have been negatively impacted.",How to Check Recalls on Baby Products," The process for recall notifications has been streamlined and improved in recent years, but you should never assume that you will be informed about any and every baby product recall. No matter the circumstances, protecting a baby is not a passive job — you need to be actively engaged in watching, checking, and acting as needed.Whether initiated by product manufacturers (as in most cases) or required by a government agency, a product recall made due to detected health or safety concerns is permanent and never expires. So, even if you are using secondhand baby products (cribs, strollers, toys, clothing, etc.), you can and should take the initiative to ensure that there are no open recalls.;
, In the U.S., six different federal agencies responsible for reporting product recalls have joined forces to create a “one-stop shop” website. This group includes the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), which is the primary agency responsible for baby product recalls.


On the webpage, choose the “Consumer Products” tab, which takes you to the CPSC site. Or, choose “Search for Recalls” and enter “baby” or a similar search term.
You can also sign up for email alerts regarding new product recalls.
Other nations may have similar websites, such as http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/index-eng.php in Canada.

, Several non-governmental websites that focus on parenting or childcare maintain searchable baby product recall pages. Look for a site with a simple search interface, basic recall details and images in the search results, and links to the official recall notifications. Consult the listing of the most recent recalls to make sure that the site is updated regularly.Many of these sites also provide the option for email alerts regarding new recalls.

, Whether you get your news from TV, websites, or newspapers, product recalls are regularly reported on as prominent points of interest. Local TV newscasts, for instance, seem to mention at least one product recall of some type daily. If you are not on an email notification list, this is probably the most likely way that you will find out about a recall.


Always confirm the details of a recall reported in the news, though. Don’t toss out your baby’s pacifiers or try to return a stroller until you have all the information about a recall. But also don’t delay unnecessarily in confirming the information.

, Baby products ranging from cribs to car seats to toys come with product registration cards you can fill out and mail in or complete online. Normally, one of the stated benefits of registering a baby product is that you will be notified directly if a recall on that product is initiated. Even if you aren’t eager to receive frequent product emails (which are usually just trying to get you to buy more of the company’s products), providing just your mailing address can make you more likely to be informed of a recall.


Don’t, however, assume that registering a product will guarantee you a recall notification. In the U.S., only car seat manufacturers are required to notify registered consumers of a children’s product recall. Use product registrations as a backup, not as your primary line of defense., Although they are usually initiated by the various product manufacturers, product recall notices follow a fairly consistent format. They identify the product by description and usually some sort of coding (like a UPC code or serial number); identify where, when, and for roughly how much it was sold; identify the reason for the recall; explain what you should do with the product; and provide contact information for the manufacturer.Make sure that the information provided in the recall notice matches your product. There can be many versions and variations of similar-looking baby products, and not all of them are likely to be recalled. However, if you don’t have enough information to confirm that the specific product you have is under recall (such as with a secondhand item), play it safe and assume that it is the recalled product.

, Once you have confirmed (or are reasonably certain) that your baby product is under recall, consult the specific instructions in the official notifications regarding what to do with the product. Depending upon the type of product and the type of hazard, the instructions usually involve some combination of returning the product to the retailer for a refund or exchange, contacting the manufacturer for a repair kit or replacement, or simply discarding the item.Your options may be more limited with a secondhand product — you can hardly return a playpen to the yard sale or your second cousin for a refund or replacement. But don’t be tempted to continue using a product that has been placed under recall just to avoid having “wasted” a few dollars on an item that you shouldn’t use anymore. Put safety first, especially when dealing with a baby.

, As a consumer, you are under no obligation to abide by a recall or disclose that a product has been recalled. As a decent human being, though, you should do both of those things. Don’t sell, give away, donate, or lend a baby product that you know or reasonably believe to have been recalled. Product recalls never expire, and neither does doing the right thing.


Before having that big yard sale with all your baby items that you no longer need, take a few moments to check one more time for recalls. Even products that were manufactured or sold years before can be the subject of a new recall., Most recalls are done out of an abundance of caution — or fear of lawsuits — and result in few injuries. If, however, you believe that your baby or someone else has been harmed in some way by a recalled product, you should consider your legal options. Start by talking to an attorney who is experienced in the field of product liability law, which varies in specifics in different jurisdictions but follows some fairly common essentials.To win a product liability claim in the U.S., you generally have to prove:

that you were actually injured or suffered actual losses.
that the product is defective.
that your injury was due to the defect.
that you were using the product as intended.

To avoid these unhappy outcomes, take a good look at the stuffed toy you’re considering giving your baby. Check the back of the toy for pull strings that might make the stuffed toy say something., Removable parts are more common on sturdier plastic toys and action figures. But stuffed toys often come with removable accessories like cups or glasses that might detach with Velcro, for instance. Give the toy a thorough investigation for parts that are removable or could break off and pose a choking hazard.Some stuffed toys have parts that seem irremovable, but actually are.For instance, stuffed toys with marble or glass eyes, or button noses, are considered unsafe for babies.If bits ever break off a stuffed toy, do not try to repair it. Instead, return the toy to the store and get a safer stuffed toy. Do not attempt to get a replacement.

, Batteries are a serious choking hazard for babies. If your baby wants a stuffed toy with batteries, ensure that the batteries are secured by a panel that must be unscrewed in order to remove the batteries. Do not give your child a stuffed toy with a battery panel that simply snaps open. While it is unlikely your baby would be able to open the battery panel, it’s not a risk worth taking.If your baby’s stuffed toy lights up, dances, or engages in some other sort of action, it is powered by batteries.
You can also identify battery-operated toys by the label on the packaging that reads “battery operated.”
Check battery-operated stuffed toys for leaking battery acid from time to time. Battery acid will leave behind a crusty, discolored area inside the battery panel. It might be brown or white in color.

Stuffed toys that are too large and/or heavy are unsafe for baby. If a heavy stuffed toy fell, it could easily smother your baby., For instance, you might encounter a stuffed toy with a package that reads, “For children 2 and up.” This means that children younger than two years old should not play with that stuffed toy. In this case, if your child is younger than two, search for a safer stuffed toy., If an older relative offers to provide you with an older stuffed toy, graciously reject the offer. Older stuffed toys might not meet current safety standards, and without the original packaging you’ll likely have no way of knowing. Plus, as hand-me-downs, they might be worn and more likely to break open at the seams."
