Video monitors can range from $100-to-$300, depending on their features. Some well-known brands will also cost more.;
,


Think about how you plan to use the monitor and where you will need it within the house. Will it need to be portable as you move around the house? Will you spend most of your time in one room or area of the house? You will be able to narrow your focus for choosing a baby video monitor by deciding on the type of monitor that best suits your family lifestyle and needs.

,


Many video monitors boast long ranges, but often these are unobstructed (meaning they can only go that far without obstacles such as walls and doors in their path). Knowing your maximum required range will help in narrowing the field. Consider the size of your house and where the baby's room is located to determine the range that you will need for the monitor. Also take the distance between you and other houses into consideration. There can be electronic interference with some monitors.

,


Baby video monitors should have basic features, such as a range that fits your house size, infrared night vision, rechargeable battery power, good picture quality and sound indicators.

,


Analog baby monitors operate on radio wave frequencies that are similar to those used by cordless telephones. These monitors often cost less, but there is a chance of interference and the signal for these monitors may not be secure (meaning that someone else with a monitor may be able to hear or see your child).
Digital baby monitors convert the sound and pictures into data, making the line secure and more interference-free. However some digital monitors can still experience interference from wireless networks that may be on the same digital frequency.

,


Baby monitors have many optional features that may, or may not, be important to you. Prioritizing the features will enable you to compare monitors and eliminate those that do not meet your needs.
Baby monitor features can include: a color screen; a 2-way channel, so parents can talk to their children remotely; music that can be played; multiple screen options so additional receivers and transmitters can be added; snapshot capability; telephone and computer connections; digital interference-free options and remote panning and zooming capability.

,


Take the time to compare prices online before buying a baby monitor. There are many websites that offer price comparisons along with expert and consumer reviews. You can also check consumer product testing and review sites, such as ConsumerReports.org or ConsumerSearch.com. Often, reading what other experts and buyers have to say about a specific video monitor can help you make a good decision on which model to purchase.

Decide where you'll bathe the baby.,
Buy an age appropriate tub.,
Consider the type of tub.,
Consider the cost.",How to Buy a Baby Bath,"


Most baby tubs are made of lightweight plastic and are easily portable so that you can use them just about anywhere. If your bathroom has a bathtub then you could use a baby bathtub that is designed to sit inside a conventionally sized tub. If your bathroom is small, then you might need to consider purchasing a tub that fits inside a large sink, like a kitchen sink.;
,


Newborns require extra special care while being bathed due to their limited neck and head control. Contoured tubs, those that are slightly angled, allow Baby to relax in a slightly inclined position. Newborns can also be bathed in a newborn mesh sling that can be placed inside a regular sized baby tub. These slings prevent Baby from moving around and keep them safe while you bathe them.
After they are about 6 months old, or when they can sit unassisted, there are a whole other variety of tubs available to them. These tubs range from simple to fancy.

,


There are a variety of baby tub designs on the market. 1 such design has a crotch post, which keeps your baby from slipping forward into the water. This is for babies who need assistance sitting. They are never, however, to be used without supervision.
Folding tubs are tubs that either collapse, or slide in on themselves to become more compact. If you're short on space, or travel frequently, this could be a good option. Baby will outgrow this tub at about 6 months.
Spa tubs are on the market for your baby's bathing pleasure. These tubs can come equipped with button activated shower heads, and battery-operated spa motors to create swirling water and bubbles.
Sink tubs are more of a sink insert than a stand alone tub. These contoured plastic tubs are designed to fit over, or in a sink. They safely cradle your child while you bathe them.

,


Most simple tubs will be fairly inexpensive, especially compared with the high-end spa baby tub models. Tubs that come with a mesh sling insert may be slightly more expensive, but you don't then have the added cost of having to purchase something for an infant. Tubs that can be converted from a newborn tub to an infant tub will be the most economical, because then you need to only buy 1 tub, as opposed to 2.

Hold your baby over your shoulder.,
Use the sitting position for older babies.,
Consider placing your baby over your knees.,
Burp your baby frequently.,
Try massage.,
Give your baby a warm bath.,
Be patient.,
Position your baby properly.,
Give your baby smaller meals.,
Feed your baby more frequently.,
Avoid placing excessive pressure on your baby’s stomach.,
Choose a peaceful location.,
Keep your baby upright after feeding.,
Consider anti-colic bottles.,
Ask your pediatrician about colic relief drops.",How to Burp a Sick Baby," This position is one of the most popular and most effective ways to burp a baby. Hold the baby with his or her chest against your shoulder, and rub or tap gently on the back until you hear a burp.


Babies sometimes spit up when you burp them, and this is especially likely if your baby is ill. Therefore, protect your clothing by throwing a rag, a towel, or a cloth diaper over your shoulder. Keep your hair tied up.;
, If your baby is older and can sit comfortably, try holding the child in a sitting position in your lap, facing away from you. Cup the baby’s chin in one hand while you rub or tap his or her back gently with the other.


Again, because sick babies tend to spit up during burping, you’ll want to have a towel or cloth diaper handy. For this position, it might be easiest to tuck a cloth into your baby’s shirt like a bib.

, Another fast and easy way to burp a baby is to place the child across your knees, face down. However, this should be your last choice when your baby is sick. Your right knee will put pressure on his or her stomach, so pay attention to your baby’s signals. Change position if he or she seems uncomfortable.

, Don’t wait until the end of a feeding to burp your baby, especially if he or she is sick. Stop periodically to let your baby expel any excess air.


If you pay attention, you’ll see that your baby often signals his or her discomfort by making noises, ceasing to suck, or otherwise seeming distressed. When this happens, stop feeding and burp your baby.
For young babies, try to burp after every two ounces, especially if he or she is sick. For healthy babies and older babies, it's okay to burp at the halfway point and again at the end of the feeding.

, If your baby is sick and having trouble burping, try placing the baby on his or her stomach and massaging very gently from the bottom of the spine up to the shoulder blades. These movement can push excess air up and out.


Do not put pressure on your baby’s stomach, and do not massage the neck – babies have sensitive, delicate necks.

, If your sick baby seems unable to burp, you can also try a warm bath. This will help relax your baby’s muscles, including those in the stomach, and may help your baby burp.

, Sometimes burping takes time. If you try different positions and still don’t get results, your baby may not be ready to burp. Try for a few more minutes, and consider a massage or bath. Then wait. You can always try again later.

, When your baby is not feeling well, it becomes especially important to choose a comfortable feeding position. Make sure your baby is at least partially upright during feeding, rather than lying down. Doing so will minimize the accumulation of excess air.

, When your baby is sick, it is best to break feedings into smaller meals rather than taxing the stomach with too much food at once. Burp well during and after each small meal.

, Smaller meals will help protect a sick baby’s stomach, but you don’t want your baby too be uncomfortably hungry. If an infant eats too voraciously, he or she will swallow more air, which will produce more gas and cause nausea.

, During feeding and burping, avoid positions that place pressure on the stomach. Instead, lift the baby gently to stretch out his or her body and create space in the stomach. Doing so will help your baby get rid of excess gas.

, Feed your baby in a quiet place. If you try to feed your baby in a noisy environment, he or she will get distracted and nervous; as a result, he or she may swallow too much air. This problem might be exacerbated when your baby is ill.

, When you finish feeding your baby, try to keep him or her in an upright position for at least 30 minutes. This will help prevent excessive spitting up and vomiting. This is good advice for all babies, healthy or not, but when your baby is sick, it is especially important. Babies who don't feel well are more likely to vomit and more likely to get dehydrated.

, If you feed your baby from a bottle, look for special anti-colic bottles, which feature an air intake system that prevents a vacuum from forming in the bottle. Because no vacuum forms, your baby will have to suck less vigorously, and he or she will probably swallow less air. Anti-colic bottles may also prevent your baby from developing a “short tongue” from always sucking intensely on the nipple.

, Some babies may require drops (such as Infacol) to help relieve stomach pain caused by gas. Ask your baby’s pediatrician if he or she thinks such drops might be necessary.

Notice if your baby displays the “3 rules of 3”.,
Be aware of conditions that can mimic colic.,
If your baby has a fever, is vomiting, or has bloody stool, call your doctor.",How to Breastfeed a Colicky Baby," Many of the things you eat will enter your breast milk, and some babies can be particularly sensitive to the proteins in breast milk from dairy items.If your baby is sensitive to dairy in your breast milk, they may have intestinal irritation and pain.;
, These foods have also been attributed to irritating most babies if they get into your breast milk., You will know that she’s hungry when she starts whimpering or making sucking sounds. Try to adhere to a consistent feeding schedule for your baby.


Don’t wait for your baby to be ravenous before feeding her, as this can make her agitated, and an agitated baby may be difficult to calm down and get to latch on to your nipple. An agitated baby also may swallow a great deal of air along with the milk, leading to abdominal discomfort and gassiness.

, Some babies prefer to be held and some feed better when their mother is reclining or lying in bed.If your baby is a “spitter” or suddenly stops feeding and cries, there may be some acid reflux. Try holding her in your arms in an upright position.

, Using one breast during feeding or the breast your baby prefers will lead to less fussiness and better feeding.During a feeding on only one breast, the breast milk becomes more calorie dense for your baby.


If your baby is feeding well, there’s no reason to stop a feeding session to switch breasts. But if your baby is still hungry after finishing on one breast, use the other breast.Your breasts may become a bit lopsided if your baby is only feeding on one breast. This is usually much more noticeable to mothers than to others. If this is bothersome to you, pump the lopsided breast after feeding is complete.

, Do this if your baby is prone to gassiness or if they tend to spit up. There are several effective positions you can use to burp your baby. If one doesn’t work, try another one until you find a position your baby likes.Hold her facing you and against your chest with her chin resting on your shoulder.
Sit her on your lap, facing you.
Lay her on your lap, belly down.
No matter which position your baby prefers, gently pat or rub their back to help them burp.

, Colicky babies don’t just cry during feedings. Swaddling your baby will calm them down, regardless of whether they are breast or formula fed., This will help to relax and calm her down. However, only position a baby on their backs when you them put to sleep.

, More “face time” like singing or speaking to her while you hold her will comfort her.

, The rocking motion will be similar to the gentle motion of being in your uterus before birth.

, Many babies will calm down by sucking on their pacifier.

, Some mothers find this soothing for their baby. Be sure to use warm water from the tap. Never use boiling water or heat the water in a microwave.


The water should feel comfortably warm on your skin, with a temperature of no more than 102 °F (39 °C).

, As long as your doctor confirms that your baby is growing normally and is healthy, your baby’s colic should disappear by the time they are 5 months old.


If none of these techniques may be working, there is still a light at the end of the tunnel!

, Babies usually become colic after two weeks old, and will cry at least three hours a day, three days a week or more, and for more than three weeks, displaying the “3 rules of 3”., These include infections like an ear or urinary tract infection, gastroesophageal (“acid”) reflux, intussusception (telescoping of one piece of the intestine into another) and other intestinal problems, physical injury, and an accidentally scratched eye.

, These symptoms are not from colic and could indicate a serious issue or infection.

Gather all the necessary materials first.,
Reduce distractions.,
Explain to your child what the medicine does.,
Put a drop on the back of their hands.,
Show them how the drops will go in.,
Reward your child.,
Let the medicine warm to room temperature.,
Wash your hands.,
Clean the outside of the eye.",How to Easily Give Eyedrops to a Baby or Child1," The faster you apply the drops, the easier it will be, especially if you have a distressed or squirming child. Make sure that you have within reach the medicine, tissues, and washcloths, as well as any pillows or towels you will be using to prop up the child’s head., Children can be easily distracted. Since you will want them to keep their gaze steady while you apply medicine, make sure that there are no distractions in the room. This means that the television should not be on, nor should there be any nearby activity that will catch their gaze., If your child is old enough to talk, explain in simple terms that you will be putting medicine in their eye. Tell them that while it may sting or feel cold at first, it will help them feel better afterwards. Warn them that their vision will be blurry, and discourage them from touching their eye afterwards., If you show them ahead of time that the medicine is safe and harmless, they will not fight as much while you apply the eye drops. You can reduce their anxiety by placing a drop on the back of their hand. While you do this, point to your eye, and tell them that you will be quickly dropping it there., Using a harmless eye lubricant, you can show them what will happen by applying eye drops to yourself. Using the applicator, tip your head back and put one drop into your eye. Blink. The calmer you are while doing this, the calmer your child will be as you do it to them.Do not use your child’s medicine for this purpose. Use a drugstore eye drop, particularly one designed for hydrating dry eyes.

, Promise your child a treat if they are able to take the eye drops well. Inform them that they must sit still, and they cannot cry. You should give them a small reward, such as a piece of candy., If you have eye drops that are kept in the refrigerator, you should remove the bottle beforehand so that it can come to room temperature. To quicken this process, you can roll the bottle between your hands until it is warm., The best way to prevent the spread of disease is to wash your hands before and after you give your child medicine. This is especially important with eye diseases, which are very infectious. Wash your hands with warm water and soap before drying them completely on a clean towel.You can also wear gloves while applying the medicine to be extra cautious. You should still wash your hands before putting on the gloves.

, If your child has crusty or gooey buildup around the eye, you will first need to clean this area. Wet a cotton ball or clean washcloth. Gently wipe the eye from the nose outward. Use separate cloths for each eye to prevent reinfection. Wash your hands after finishing."

Talk to your nurses about doing kangaroo care, which helps you bond with your baby. With this technique, you hold your unclothed baby (wearing a diaper) against your naked chest. One option is to wear a baggy button down shirt. You then button the shirt up to the child’s upper back so that the baby is inside your shirt and the heat is locked in.Alternatively, you can place a blanket on your baby's back so that the heat is trapped.


Fathers and mothers should both do kangaroo care.Kangaroo care can stabilize your baby’s heart rate, breathing, and oxygen saturation levels. The care also works to reduce crying and help your baby gain weight.;
, Premature babies often have difficulty sucking, swallowing, and breathing correctly. This makes breastfeeding and bottle feeding complicated.You can, however, choose to pump your milk and have the doctors feed it to your baby via tubes.


If you choose not to breastfeed, the hospital might, with your permission, use a donor’s milk. There also are formulas available that are designed for premature babies. They have extra fat and protein to help preemies grow. There are also supplements that can be added to pumped breastmilk called human milk fortifier. Most babies born at 34 – 36 weeks gestation can use regular formula or a transitional formula., Some babies need to be fed through IVs. Others have a tube placed in their mouth or nose that goes to their stomachs. For the latter, some hospitals will allow you to participate in this process.The nurses will show you how to put the tube inside the baby and make sure the position is correct. They will instruct how to get your child to suck, which can benefit later breastfeeding or bottle feeding. They also will help you learn how to handle vomit.Babies born at 34 weeks or later gestation often can breastfeed or drink from a bottle. Oftentimes, breastfeeding is easier than bottle feeding for premature babies. Preemies can have difficulty stopping the milk flow from a bottle, which can lead to choking or breathing problems., While your baby is still receiving tube feedings, doctors will encourage you to try bottle feedings when your baby is ready. You will start once a day and gradually increase the number of bottle feedings. Your baby needs to learn how to feed and breathe simultaneously.To bottle feed your baby, do the following:


Hold the baby in your arms. Cradle him in the crook of your right or left arm so that you are supporting his head. He should almost be sitting, not laying down. You do not want him to choke.
Position his head so it is leaning forwards and in front of his body. It should not be twisted to the side.
Keep his arms and hands forward and near the bottle.
Place the bottle in his mouth. Try to help him suck the nipple. Do not force the bottle down his throat and never leave him propped up with the bottle alone.
Pull the bottle out after every few sucks. This will reduce the chance of your baby becoming too tired. If his lips turn blue and his heart rate is too low, he is over-exerting himself.
Do not rush your baby.Preemies need more time to feed as they are learning a new process at a younger than normal age.

, While in the hospital, many babies receive either your or a donor’s breastmilk or formula via tubes. Upon discharge, the doctor might prescribe a special formula called “post-discharge milk.” This formula has more nutrients than ordinary, store-bought formula. Your baby should use this formula until your doctor directs otherwise.Larger premature babies often can use normal baby formula that is iron fortified. Your baby should use this formula until she is at least four to six months old.Normal formulas are available for purchase at grocery stores, drugstores, and superstores like Target.Do not change your formula without consulting your physician., Generally, newborns should receive 2.5 oz. (75 ml) of formula per pound (450 g) of body weight each day.Premature babies can have different needs, though. Thus, it is best to have open dialogue with your medical team about feeding amounts. Oftentimes, premature babies drink 2 – 3 oz (60-90 mL) of formula per feeding once home., Speak with your doctor about how often you should feed your baby once home. If your baby is receiving bottles, how many should he have per day? Many premature babies feed every three to four hours once they are home.They also feed upon wakening.

, Preemies who receive formula in the hospital often receive vitamins A, C, and D plus folic acid supplements. When feeding your formula to your baby at home, she likely will need to continue supplements.You can also add the supplements to the formula itself.


Speak with your doctor about your baby’s nutritional needs. Do not implement changes without her approval.
Your doctor might recommend fortifiers. These give formula or breastmilk added minerals, vitamins, and protein. They help your baby’s bone growth.Babies taking breastmilk are often prescribed iron supplements also.
Your doctor also might recommend probiotics to prevent gut infections in your preemie. These nutritional supplements consist of yeast and bacteria. , There are many different types of formulas. Which type you choose depends largely on what your doctor recommends. Some come in a ready-to-go liquid form. Others are powders that you must mix with water. Still others are concentrated liquids that you must add water to. In every case, follow the instructions on the packaging. Once you have prepared a formula, you should refrigerate it until use and use it within 24 hours.It is advisable to make a day’s batch all at one time. This will reduce the time you need to spend mixing the formula.Wash your hands and any utensils or bottles you use thoroughly. Let bottles dry in the air.Keep your formula cool before use but heat it up prior to use. To do so, place it in a container with warm water for five minutes.Avoid heating formula in the microwave., To coax your premature baby to eat, sit in a calm, quiet, and peaceful environment. Avoid harsh sunlight or artificial lighting. Choose a cushioned, supportive chair in which you too will feel comfortable.

, Using the instructions you learned at hospital, hold your baby in his correct position and attempt to feed. Help your baby want to feed by giving your child oral stimulation. To do so, use your finger to gently touch your baby’s cheeks, mouth, tongue, and gums. Complete this action before and after you feed. After this process, put the bottle in your baby’s mouth.Remember that just like in the hospital, feeding can take a longer time with a premature baby. Consider watching a movie (nothing with too loud of sounds) or reading a book.

, Halfway through the feeding, place the baby upright and over your shoulder. Gently pat her back for one to three minutes. Continue feeding after she has burped. Then at the end of the feeding, burp her again., Premature babies’ digestive systems are particularly sensitive. If your baby’s stool forms and patterns change for more than two or three days, call your doctor. Your child might need a different formula or you might need to feed more or less often. He also could be developmentally unable to bottle feed regularly.Signs of discomfort include hiccups, coughing, gagging, excessive spit up, crying, biting, head turning, turning blue, and fanning of the fingers. If your child exhibits these symptoms, stop feeding immediately. Also, consult your doctor., Even though she might not have teeth, you want to protect her gums. After feeding, wipe her gums with a clean, moistened cloth. You also can purchase an infant toothbrush and use it with warm (not hot or too cold) water."

By swaddling them, you will be ensuring that they remain still throughout the procedure., It is easiest to place the baby on your lap. Make sure that their head is closest to you with their body extended out along your legs., With a finger, press down on the skin below their eye and gently pull it down. You only want to pull down enough to expose the lower whites of their eye. There should be a small gap for the medicine to go in. Be extremely gentle as you do this. You do not want to upset the baby, nor do you want to injure them.If the baby is upset or wiggling, ask another adult to help. They can help hold the baby's head still while you quickly put the drops in. This will also free your hands to help with applying the drops., Bring the dropper within one inch of their eye, but make sure that it is not touching any part of the eye, including their eye lashes. Squeeze the medicine along their lower eyelid. As they blink, watch to make sure that the medicine touches their eye., If you are having difficulty putting the medicine into their eyes while they are open, you can try applying the medicine while their eyes are closed. This can be done while they are asleep. Drop the medicine into their closed eye along the corner closest to their nose. If your baby opens their eyes, it will run into their eyeballs.
If they do not open their eyes, you can open their eyes for them. With your index finger resting on their brow and your thumb on their cheek, gently pull open their eyelids so that the medicine runs in.

Ask them to focus on the toy to keep their eyes looking up. This will allow the medicine to run easily into their eyes.

, You may rest your finger on their cheek, and with extreme care, gently pull down the lid to expose the lower white of their eye. You want to create a small space for the medicine to enter their eye., Without the dropper touching their eye, drop the medicine along their lower eyelid and their eyeball. In this method, you want to make sure it does not pool in the tear ducts, along the inner corner of the eye. , They may need to blink once or twice. Alternatively, you could ask them to keep their eyes closed for ten seconds before opening again. Ask them not to rub their eyes.

, Now that the process is over, you should make sure that everyone’s hands are clean to prevent the infection from spreading. Frequent hand washing can dramatically cut down on spreading further infection

The goal is to quickly drop in the medicine while they are restrained. , If they are thrashing and crying, it may be difficult to open their eyes. If they are not cooperating, you can apply the medicine to their closed eyes. Watch for when their head is still and their eyes are closed for longer than a second before applying the drops.

Try to focus on elastic clothes.
Avoid clothes with buttons. Instead, opt for Velcro.
Focus on clothes with removable bottoms.
Pick baby clothing that allows for easy diaper changes. Dressing baby in layers and two-pieces, rather than one-piece outfits without easy diaper access, are also preferable options.;
, The softness of fabrics is very important when buying baby clothes. Ultimately, just as you wouldn’t want to wear uncomfortable clothes, babies don’t want to either. Make sure to focus on clothes made out of fabrics you’d want to wear yourself.


Avoid wool.
Focus on high thread count cotton.
Consider synthetics like polyester., An important factor to consider when buying baby clothes is making sure they are appropriate for the season. Having baby clothes appropriate for the season will make sure your baby is properly suited for the weather and also looks stylish.


Warm clothes are absolutely necessary in the winter time. Make sure to consider warm onesies, socks, booties, and head coverings.
Make sure the baby is not too warm in the fall, spring, or summer. Don’t weigh them down with winter gear just because it looks cute., You should only focus on necessary items for the first six months of a baby’s life. The ultimate reason is that babies grow really fast and will outgrow clothing items shortly after they can wear them. Consider these items:


Purchase onesies and body suits. These can have snaps down the front or side, and between the legs. They can also be long or short sleeve, depending on the weather.
Choose pairs of comfortable pants that can be removed easily for diaper changes.
Select baby hats and a quality sun hat to keep the heat in. A baby's head should be covered the first few months to protect from the cold and the sun.
Stock up on socks and booties.
Gather lots of bibs., Buying clothes that launder easily is very important since the baby may spit up or otherwise mess their clothing frequently. Because of this, you might go through a couple of sets of clothing a day and quickly accumulate a lot of clothing to launder. As a result, you’ll want to focus on clothes that launder easily – this will save you a lot of time.


Avoid knits, as you’ll need to hang dry them. In addition, they might pill or degrade quickly if not taken care of.
Recognize that cotton shrinks when exposed to heat.
Wash wool with cold water and at all costs avoid the dryer. Because of this, wool baby clothes might be a bad choice., This is not only because babies grow fast, but so that you can use the outfit longer. As a result, think carefully about purchasing clothes big enough whenever you buy new clothes.


While at the outset you may not want your baby’s clothes to be too big, you’ll thank yourself when you see a shirt or a pair of jammies lasting double as long as they would have otherwise.
If you decide to purchase an outfit for when the baby is six months or older, make sure that you take into account what the season will be when the outfit will eventually fit., A great way to save money when buying baby clothes is to watch for when department stores and other retailers have sales. Sales will provide a great opportunity to stretch your dollar and buy baby clothes.


Subscribe to popular couponing websites, like Groupon, so you can get alerts when coupons or sales are available at your favorite retailer.
Check your local Sunday paper for sales in your area.
Browse the websites of large online retailers regularly., A great way to save money on baby clothes is to buy used. Buying used will aid in the process by making sure you have a lot more money to spend. Not only will you be able to buy more of a diversity of clothes, but you’ll make a limited amount of money go a lot farther in terms of the baby’s age and clothing needs.


Visit thrift stores.
Look to second-hand specialty baby stores.
Ask friends and family if they have old baby clothes they don’t need anymore., Save money by purchasing baby clothes at the end of the season for the following year. While it might take a lot of planning, because you’ll have to account for the age of the baby at a given time of the year, you’ll wind up saving a lot of money.


Carefully consider your baby’s size and age at the time.
As the summer season comes to an end, consider purchasing next year's summer clothing for the baby. Do the same at the end of winter. You can save a substantial amount of money when purchasing from end of season clearance items.
Just like with buying in-season clothes, make sure that you buy large to provide extra space for unexpected growth., Whenever buying clothes for a baby, always buy small amounts. This is because babies grow fast. You didn’t want to stock up on clothes only to have the baby outgrow them. Good planning and control will wind up saving you a lot of money.


Buy clothes as you need them.
Consider buying clothes every other weekend or even once a month. Plan for several weeks at a time, rather than for several months or a whole year.
When buying larger sized clothes for the future, don’t buy too much at one time either. If you see a great deal, buy a little bit, not a lot., Buying unisex baby clothes is another great way to save money. If you plan on having more children, unisex clothing will allow you to reuse the clothing.


Colors that are considered unisex include yellow, mint green, orange, cream and white.
Don’t feel obligated to stick to supposed “gender specific” colors. Clothe the baby in whatever you think is appropriate or in what the baby seems to prefer.
Most all jammies and onesies can be unisex., Fire retardant clothes have been popular for years as a safety measurement to reduce the risks of fire. However, in recent years, researchers have demonstrated the possibility that fire retardants might cause cancer or other health problems. As a result, make sure to carefully consider the pros and cons of fire retardant clothes.


Risks of fire and fire retardant clothes can be mitigated by making sure your home is free from common fire hazards like open flames, people smoking inside, or faulty electrical wiring., Clothes with small pieces may present a choking hazard to babies. This is because the child may be able to remove the bead or other small detachable piece and eat it.


Cut off any bead, plastic, or any other small pieces that a baby may be able to remove from clothes and choke on.
Avoid sequins. While sequins might seem cute on a baby, the baby might be able to remove them and wind up eating them.

, Drawstrings on the neck of baby hoodies or on the waistbands of pants can be a hazard to babies. Drawstrings present a strangulation hazard to babies. As a result, stay away from drawstrings.


Focus on clothes with elastic instead of drawstrings.
Remove drawstrings from any clothes you may have.
Return any gifts people give you that may have drawstrings."

Recognize the symptoms of jaundice.,
Test your baby for jaundice.,
Take your baby to the doctor for a diagnosis.,
Seek emergency treatment if symptoms are severe.,
Understand the importance of treating jaundice.",How to Fight Jaundice in a Newborn1," The main symptoms of jaundice are a yellowish tint of the skin — most notable in the palms and plantar surfaces of the feet — and a yellowing of the whites of the eyes.Most babies with jaundice don’t require treatment.You should still be aware of indications that the jaundice is getting worse.


A deeper yellowing of the skin is a sign that jaundice may be getting worse.
Watch for signs that the yellow tint is spreading to other parts of the baby's body like the abdomen, arms or legs.
If your baby is listless, it could be a sign that the jaundice is becoming more severe.
If your newborn is not feeding well and unable to gain weight it might mean the jaundice is worsening.
High-pitched cries from your baby are a sign that the jaundice is getting worse.;
, The baby may not have been diagnosed with jaundice at the hospital. If you suspect jaundice once the baby gets home, try a skin test that's reliable, fast and easy.If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact your doctor.


If your baby has fair skin, try the following: Press a finger against your baby's skin. This will push the blood out of the skin for a moment. The infant’s skin should turn white. If the skin remains yellow, it’s jaundiced.Perhaps the best place to notice mild jaundice is by gently pressing the tip of your infant's nose which is has many blood vessels and where jaundice is easily seen
Perform this test in a well-lit room so that you can identify skin color changes with ease.
If your baby has darker skin, check for yellowness in the whites of the eyes, nails, palms or gums.Contact your doctor if your baby doesn't pass the skin test.

, Your baby's doctor will measure the level of bilirubin in your baby’s blood by puncturing the heel to draw blood. The level of bilirubin detected in the baby’s blood will significantly contribute to assessing the level of severity of the jaundice and whether the condition needs treatment.


A skin test might also be conducted, using a transcutaneous bilirubinometer to measure the reflection of light shone through the infant's skin. The bilirubinometer is less invasive than drawing blood from the newborn.
It’s possible that your doctor orders additional blood or urine tests if underlying problems are suspected.To determine that treatment is needed, the doctor will look at how well your baby is feeding to assess how your baby is affected by the jaundice. Other factors like whether the birth was premature, whether bruising occurred at birth, and your baby's age might affect the treatment plan.
If your baby has older siblings who have had severe jaundice, this will also factor into the treatment plan., If jaundice is left untreated, bilirubin can enter the baby’s brain, causing a condition called acute bilirubin encephalopathy. Prompt treatment is critical before brain damage occurs. There are behavioral and physical symptoms indicating this condition. Note that your infant should be under the care of a doctor long before these symptoms develop. During acute bilirubin encephalopathy, the newborn may:Develop a fever or vomit
Arch her back or neck
Be listless and difficult to wake
Feed poorly

, Most cases of jaundice subside on their own in one to two weeks. There are also times when it's critical that jaundice be treated. Kernicterus, though rare, occurs when bilirubin has caused permanent brain damage.


Uncontrolled or involuntary movements are evidence of Kernicterus.
Loss of hearing can be an indication of brain damage.
A frozen upward gaze can be a sign of brain damage.

"
Consider your baby's age.,
Factor in other circumstances.,
Understand the habit.,
Learn about other potential causes of night waking.,
Work on one feeding at a time.,
Minimize noise, light, and distraction.,
Decrease the feeding amount.,
Burp the baby.,
Stop when ready.,
Soothe the baby after waking.,
Instruct your partner to comfort the baby at night.,
Know when to quit.,
Give your baby more food during the day.,
Offer extra evening feedings.,
Keep your baby awake during feedings.,
Offer a pacifier.",How to Drop a Night Feed," Every child is different, but most babies can be weaned from night feedings when they are at least four to six months old.


Also note that your baby should at least be 14 lbs (6.45 kg) before you drop a night feeding.Night feedings generally won't harm your baby, so if you don't see a need to drop them, you can wait until your child naturally initiates the process by sleeping through the night. Your child should eventually grow out of the night feeding phase even if you don't assist him or her, but the process will take longer.
If you don't know whether or not your baby is ready to stop night feeding, talk to your child's physician.;
, Even though babies will eventually grow out of the need by themselves, it might be necessary to drop night feedings if your own well-being depends on it.


For instance, if you've returned to work and your baby's night feedings are making it impossible for you to get enough sleep, you might need to rearrange feedings so that they only occur during waking hours.
No matter what, though, you need to make sure that your baby is physically ready to stop night feedings. Do not drop this part of your baby's eating routine if he or she still needs it for the sake of development.

, Even babies who don't need to eat in the middle of the night may still wake up during that time. Moreover, they may still expect to be fed, even if they don't actually need it.


For this reason, dropping a night feed is mainly a matter of breaking the routine your baby has already grown accustomed to.
Keep in mind that breastfed babies typically feed more often than bottle-fed babies. With the former, the weaning process may take longer since the baby will naturally wake up more often.

, Your baby might be waking up in the middle of the night to eat, but there's also a chance that he or she could be waking up for a different reason. In that case, dropping night feeds can become both difficult and impractical.


Periods of external and internal transition can cause your baby to wake up in the middle of the night.
For instance, if you've just recently returned to work, moved to a new home, or arrived home after an extended family vacation, the shift in attention and activity could make your baby too anxious to sleep.
Major milestones can make it difficult for babies to sleep, too. Babies who have recently learned how to sit up may find it more difficult to settle back down. Babies who are teething may experience pain that keeps them awake.

, If your baby eats more than once during the middle of the night, you will need to drop night feedings one by one. Do not attempt to drop all night feeds at the same time.


There's no definitively right way to choose which feeding to start with, but generally, it works well if you start with the middle feeding and gradually work your way outward. If your baby eats three times during the middle of the night, stop the second feed first, then the first feed, and then the last feed.

, Regardless of how you've been feeding baby at night until now, you should minimize possible sources of distraction and stimulation as much as possible. Keep your baby calm and tired to help him or her ease back into sleep more smoothly.


Dim the lights as much as possible. Use the lowest light setting you feel comfortable moving around in.
Do not hold conversations, turn on the television, or turn on the radio while feeding your baby. The noise can make your baby too excited to fall back asleep.
Only change your baby if absolutely necessary. Feel the outside of the diaper or peak into it instead of removing it completely. If it's cold and wet, or if there is something solid in the diaper, a change will be necessary. Any diaper changes should be done in the middle of a feeding instead of the end.

, If your baby is bottle fed, you'll need to decrease the amount of formula/milk you put in the bottle during the feeding. If your baby is breastfed, you'll need to decrease the amount of time you allow your baby to feed.For breastfed babies, time the length of your average night feed before you begin weaning your baby. Once you know the average length of time, reduce that amount by two to five minutes every other night.

If your baby usually eats for 20 minutes, reduce that amount to 17 minutes or so for two nights, then 14 minutes for two nights, and 11 minutes for another two nights. Continue along this pattern.


For bottle-fed babies, simply cut down the volume of milk by about 1 oz (30 ml) every other night.

If your baby usually drinks 6 oz (180 ml), cut that down to 5 oz (150 ml) for two nights, 4 oz (120 ml) for another two nights, 3 oz (90 ml) for another two nights, and 2 oz (60 ml) for yet another two nights.



, After your baby eats, make sure that he or she has been well burped before you put your child back in bed.You might think that burping your baby will wake him or her up, but if you don't do it, your child will likely begin crying within 10 to 20 minutes as the built-up, trapped gas starts to cause stomach pain.

, As long as your baby no longer needs a night feeding, you can usually drop one within five to seven days.


If you have a breastfed baby, you should be able to drop the night feed once you've cut it down to five minutes or less.
If you have a bottle fed baby, you should be able to drop the nigh feed once you've reduced it to 2 oz (60 ml) or less.

, After completely dropping a night feed, avoid feeding your baby again during that time if he or she continues to wake. Find other ways to comfort your baby to sleep.


Speak soothing phrases like, ""Everything's okay. Time to go to sleep."" Talk to your baby quickly in a calm, quiet whisper, and try to avoid eye contact. If necessary, you may rub your baby's back, but only do so for two to four minutes and only if he or she has not fallen back asleep within 10 minutes.
Avoid angry, excited, or otherwise intense interactions. Greater amounts of stimulation will make it harder for your baby to fall back asleep.
Try not to hold your baby in your arms after he or she wakes. Rocking your baby to sleep could inadvertently increase the anxiety he or she feels upon waking a second time since you seemingly disappeared without warning.

, If you find that you are unable to soothe your baby back to sleep, have your partner take over that responsibility.


This can be especially important for mothers who breastfeed. Your baby may smell your breastmilk, and that scent may trigger or enhance the desire to feed.
Even if you feed your baby formula, this can still be a beneficial tactic to try if you have been primarily responsible for feeding the baby at night. Your son or daughter may associate you with night feeds, so when he or she sees you, the desire to eat will be harder to erase.

, It's normal for a baby to cry for one to three nights after you drop a feeding, but if the waking and crying continues past that time, you may need to resume the feeding again.There are many things that may have prevented the process from working the first time. It is quite possible that your baby wasn't ready, or something may have disrupted the process with or without your knowledge.
If you need to pick the night feeding back up, resume your normal routine and try to drop the feeding again after another two weeks or so have passed.

, Dropping a night feed does not mean cutting back on the amount of food you give your child. In fact, you may need to feed your baby more during the day to make up for the milk he or she is not getting at night.


Some babies resist daytime feedings as they grow older because of how active and stimulated they are during the day. Stopping to eat may seem unpleasant if your baby believes he or she is missing out on something.
Work around this potential problem by taking scheduled breaks for daytime feedings. Move to a quiet room with no distractions. Distractions can include televisions, radios, computers, and noisy family members.

, Make sure your baby's stomach is filled before he or she goes to sleep. Consider adding an extra feeding to your evening schedule so that your child will stay full for a longer period of time into the night.


Feed your baby just before he or she goes to bed, then consider feeding your baby again just before you go to bed.
If you feed your baby before you go to bed, this may mean you'll have to wake your child up. Even if he or she only eats a small amount during this time, that extra food might be enough to keep your baby full until morning.

, Don't allow your baby to fall asleep in the middle of a meal, regardless of whether that meal happens at night or in the middle of the day.Babies can learn to associate feeding with sleeping if they regularly fall asleep before finishing a meal.
A baby who associates the two actions can start depending on his or her feeding to fall asleep. You need to help your baby learn how to fall asleep without feeding.
If you notice your baby falling asleep in the middle of a feeding, stop the feeding immediately and cuddle for a few minutes. Put your child to bed while he or she is still awake.

, For many babies, suckling is a way to comfort themselves. Your baby may feel the need to suckle even if he or she isn't hungry, which may prompt your child to cry for food even if it isn't needed.


This is why pacifiers can work well when you're trying to drop night feeds. When you suspect that your baby is full in spite of his or her cries, encourage your child to take a pacifier. This can be done during both the day and night.
Note that babies who have never used a pacifier may need some encouragement before they accept it, and some babies may never take to it.

Treat uncomplicated jaundice with filtered sunlight.,
Increase daily feedings for your baby.,
Lower your newborn’s level of bilirubin with phototherapy.,
Replace the baby’s blood with blood from a matching donor.",How to Fight Jaundice in a Newborn2," By far the best way to treat simple, uncomplicated newborn jaundice is by exposing your infant to filtered sunlight either through a polarized window or shade in your home or by taking him outside in a covered stroller for five minutes twice daily.The infant should not be exposed to direct sunlight, but can benefit from sunlight filtered through a shade or glass specifically treated to allow blue light through while blocking ultraviolet rays.Some pediatricians are reluctant to recommend this due to the harmful effects of sun rays on sensitive infant skin; however, all over the world this is still the preferred treatment as long as parents are mindful of the amount and type of exposure.

, Breastmilk is important to your baby because it encourages bowel movements, which help to remove bilirubin from the baby’s system. The more your baby feeds, the more milk is produced and the more bilirubin your baby excretes. Your doctor may suggest an increase in feeding.A breastfed baby may be upped from eight to ten feedings per day. Supplementation may also be suggested. The newborn should be kept hydrated to help excrete bilirubin from their body.
A formula supplement to breastfeeding may be necessary to keep your newborn hydrated. Excess loss of water can occur through the newborn’s skin.
Consider working with a lactation professional to ensure the baby is feeding properly. A lactation professional can also help with supplementation. , Your doctor may order light therapy for you baby either at home or in the hospital. Your baby will be placed under special lighting that emits blue-green light. This changes the shape and structure of the bilirubin molecules so that they can be excreted in urine and stool.


The baby will be weighed each day and the levels of bilirubin in your newborn’s blood will be checked often.Your baby will wear a diaper and protective eye patches during treatment.
The light isn't an ultraviolet light. A protective shield filters out ultraviolet light that may be emitted.
Light therapy may be supplemented with the use of a light-emitting mattress or pad.If standard phototherapy doesn’t work, the doctor might suggest the baby be placed on a fiber optic blanket; an additional bank of lights might be added.Physiological jaundice (the most common form) almost never requires treatment beyond phototherapy.

, An exchange transfusion may be ordered by your doctor if the bilirubin levels in your baby’s blood remain high. Your newborn will receive new blood through a small plastic tube inserted into a blood vessel. The bilirubin-heavy blood will be replaced with bilirubin-free blood reducing levels quickly.Your baby’s condition will be closely monitored throughout the transfusion process.
An exchange transfusion can take several hours.
When the transfusion is completed, your baby’s blood will be tested for bilirubin. If the levels haven’t dropped enough then the baby will undergo another transfusion.
An intravenous transfusion of an immunoglobulin might help to prevent the necessity of a blood transfusion. It introduces a blood protein to the infant that that can reduce levels of antibodies.
An intravenous transfusion of an immunoglobulin could decrease jaundice and eliminate the need for an exchange blood transfusion."

Test your blood early in your pregnancy.,
Anticipate jaundice in your newborn.,
Avoid lifestyles that can lead to preterm labor and birth.",How to Fight Jaundice in a Newborn3," There are certain blood types that conflict between mother and baby. If the mother’s blood cells access the baby’s by crossing the placenta, the mother can form antibodies which lead to jaundice in the newborn.


ABO as well as RH incompatibility can lead to jaundice and can be detected in an early blood test.
Blood type incompatibilities  can be prevented with an RH-immune globulin administered at twenty-eight weeks in the pregnancy., Feed your baby often, since you can help your newborn to keep bilirubin levels manageable by increasing bowel movements in the baby. Even if your baby hasn’t been diagnosed with jaundice, you can anticipate the possibility of an increase in bilirubin levels and reduce those levels.


Eight to twelve feedings daily will help in reducing the risk of an onset of significant jaundice., High bilirubin levels resulting in jaundice occur in eighty percent of preterm babies. Bilirubin levels were found to be high, almost without exception, in babies born at thirty-five weeks or lessincreasing the risk of jaundice.Refrain from smoking cigarettes—they increase the chances of preterm birth. Secondhand smoke also increases the likelihood of preterm birth.
Drug use contributes to preterm birth.
Alcohol consumption can also contribute to the likelihood of preterm  birth."

Pay attention to gastrointestinal problems.,
Look for bloody stools.,
Monitor your baby's behavior.,
Check your baby for skin rash or nasal congestion.,
Look for allergic colitis in newborns to one-year olds.,
Identify risk factors for allergic colitis.",How to Diagnose Allergic Colitis in Babies1," You may notice your baby is very gassy after eating. While gassiness is a common gastrointestinal problem, if your baby is also experiencing diarrhea or vomiting, she may have allergic colitis.It's a good idea to keep a journal of how often your baby has experienced diarrhea, gas or vomiting. This can be helpful in making a diagnosis.;
, Check your baby's diapers for blood. Bloody stools are one of the most common signs of allergic colitis in babies between 2 and 6 weeks old. There may only be a little blood or spotting, but bloody stools could lead to other health complications.Know that bloody stools could be a sign of, or lead to, other health problems.
If your baby is experiencing heavy bleeding, the cause may not be allergic colitis. The doctor will want to check your baby for tears in the perianal area or other issues.

, While crying and fussing are normal, recognize when your baby seems irritable. If you think your baby is constantly upset, extremely fussy, or can't be calmed, your baby may have allergic colitis.Your baby will probably also have trouble eating or will refuse to eat.

, In addition to gastrointestinal problems or bloody stools, your baby might develop common allergic reactions. Look for a skin rash (eczema) or nasal congestion.Your baby may have more of these allergic symptoms if their allergic colitis is severe as opposed to a mild case.

, Allergic colitis can appear in newborn babies and infants through age one. Most babies that develop allergic colitis start showing mild symptoms by the time they're two months old, but they can appear as late as six months old.You may realize that your baby's symptoms worsen over time.

, If you or the baby's other parent has an allergic disease, your baby has a 30% risk of developing allergic disease as well. If both of you have an allergic disease, your baby has a 60% risk. This means that a baby may be at increased risk of allergic colitis if one or both parents has a medical history of allergic disease.About 1% to 2% of all babies have allergic colitis. Other risk factors for colitis include family history of asthma or environmental allergies.

Be aware that breastfed babies can often go a week without pooping.Formula fed babies can also have similar swings.Use the following frame of reference for your baby's bowel movements: 0–4 month old babies poop three to four times a day on average. After babies start eating solids, that decreases to about one bowel movement every day.;
, You might suspect your baby is constipated if he isn’t pooping. This can be a sign of constipation, but it isn’t the only one. If you notice any of the following physical symptoms, your baby might be constipated:Firm belly that is painful to the touch
Hard stools
Stools that are difficult to pass
Small streak of bright red blood in the stool
Straining for 10 minutes without success
Pellet-like stools
Arching the back
Tightening buttocks

, Constipation can be very painful and distressing for your baby. In addition to physical symptoms, she may also exhibit behavioral signs of constipation. If you observe any of the following behavioral signs, your baby might be constipated:Making straining faces
Refusal to eat
Crying

, It can be dangerous to give a newborn, or a baby up to three months, water or juice of any kind. Instead, if you suspect your newborn is constipated, call your pediatrician and let her know. Provide the doctor any necessary details and listen to whatever advice she gives you to help relieve the constipation without medical intervention., If you suspect that your baby is constipated, give him little bit of water in addition to regular feedings. Start off with 2 to 4 ounces (or 60 to 120 milliliters) and figure out from here if your baby needs more or less water to relieve his constipation.Use regular tap water or still, bottled water if you like. Put the water in one of your baby’s clean bottles.
Only give water once a day, as too much water can be dangerous for babies.

, If water doesn’t help your baby, switch to fruit juice. Give the baby 2–4 ounces (or 60 to 120 milliliters) prune or pear juice once a day in addition to daily feedings. Determine from this amount if you need to give your baby more or less juice.Dilute one part juice to one part water if the juice seems to be too much for your baby. You can also give your baby a little apple juice if she doesn’t like pear or prune juice., If your baby is eating solids, you can also give him foods that are high in fiber. This can loosen stools and may stimulate the baby’s bowels.Give your baby pureed peas or prunes for his meal.
Substitute barley cereal for rice cereal.
Try the “P” fruits: pears, plums, and peaches. In addition, the “B” vegetables may also help: broccoli, beans, and Brussels sprouts., Movement and activity can help stimulate your baby’s intestines. Moving her legs in a bicycling motion can get your baby’s bowels moving and may produce a bowel movement.Move your baby’s legs gently and talk to her to comfort and distract her from any pain and discomfort.

, Tummy time is an important part of any baby’s development. But tummy time can also expel gas and may stimulate a bowel movement.Put your baby on his tummy either on a clean floor or across your lap for 20 minutes to see if it helps stimulate the bowels., A massage can calm and comfort any baby. It may also move trapped gas in your baby’s belly and help move her bowels. Try rubbing your baby’s belly in a clockwise motion to see if it helps the constipation.Consider massaging your baby during a warm bath. The water should be up to his chest. As the baby relaxes, it may also release his bowels. This is messy, but may be effective at relieving his constipation., If dietary changes and movement don’t relieve your baby’s constipation, schedule an appointment with her pediatrician. The doctor can diagnose the problem and offer alternative dietary or medical treatments.


Sometimes your baby's doctor may prescribe medications such as MiraLAX or Lactulose for constipation. These medications bring fluid into the colon to make the stools softer and easier to pass.
Provide your doctor any relevant information necessary to diagnose and treat the problem. Let him know about dietary changes and what measures you’ve taken to relieve your baby’s constipation.
Ask any questions you may have about your baby’s constipation, treating it, and preventing future bouts.

, If your baby hasn’t pooped in a few days, try a glycerin suppository. Inserting one in your baby’s anus may help quickly relieve constipation. Be aware that glycerin suppositories are only meant for occasional use.Get the suppository at your local pharmacy. These are available without a prescription.You can also get liquid glycerin, which you can drop into your baby’s rectum.Make sure you are using the right type and size for your baby's age.
Insert the suppository as far into your baby’s rectum as you are able. Hold the baby’s buttocks together for a few minutes while the suppository dissolves. Make sure to talk to and comfort your baby so that she doesn’t get scared when you’re inserting the suppository or holding her buttocks together.

, There is conflicting information about using anything other than glycerin suppositories to relieve infant constipation. Talk to your doctor about whether other medical constipation relievers are okay for your baby before using them., Some doctors may suggest giving your baby corn or Karo syrup to relieve constipation. This product has a similar effect to eating fruits or fruit juices. Try giving your baby 1–2 tablespoons of either corn or Karo syrup every day to relieve constipation., Flax oil may help relieve your baby’s constipation. In addition, it can facilitate the absorption of vitamins and nutrients your baby may be losing as a result of the constipation.Give infants one teaspoon of flax oil every day for constipation.

, Babies can get constipation for a variety of reasons ranging from changes in diet to emotional distress. Identifying possible causes may help you figure out a way to relieve and prevent constipation in your baby. The following can cause constipation in children:New foods or milks
Emotional distress
Insufficient water consumption
Insufficient fiber consumption
Dairy products like cheese or yogurt
Too much of the ABCs—applesauce, bananas, cereal
A more serious problem, such as thyroid condition, cystic fibrosis, or Hirschsprung's disease (though this is rare)

, Starting your baby on solids or using a new milk or formula can cause constipation. Watch your baby closely for a couple of weeks when changing his diet to detect signs of constipation before they become a painful problem.


Notice any changes to your baby’s stools or behavior when making these change. Even something like a few hard pellets instead of a runny diaper can signal the onset of constipation.

, Certain foods that a baby eats can make her more prone to constipation, especially if the child eats them a lot. If you are breastfeeding, you should be conscious of what you are eating — try to skip dairy for a while and try soy products instead.Limiting how much of the following foods your baby eats may prevent a painful bout of constipation:Yogurt
Cheese
Applesauce
Bananas
Cereal, especially rice cereal
White rice

Take your baby to a medical appointment.,
Talk with the doctor about your baby's diet.,
Get a physical exam.,
Get a diagnosis of mild to moderate or severe allergic colitis.,
Talk with the doctor about a treatment plan.",How to Diagnose Allergic Colitis in Babies2," If you suspect your baby has allergic colitis symptoms or if you notice bloody stools or vomiting, set up a medical appointment with the pediatrician. You'll need to give the doctor your baby's complete medical history (including family history of allergies). If you kept a journal of your baby's symptoms, bring it along.The doctor might suggest that you take your baby to see a pediatric gastroenterologist.

, Let the doctor know what your baby is eating. For example, if your baby is formula fed, you should be able to give the exact name of the product you're giving. If you're breastfeeding your baby, the doctor will probably ask what you typically eat. If you've introduced solids, tell the doctor what foods your baby eats and if they've had any allergic reactions to foods.The doctor may want you to feed the baby while you're in the office. You may need to bring formula or nurse the baby. This will give the doctor a chance to look for any signs of irritation or discomfort that your baby might have after eating.

, The doctor should perform a routine wellness check on your baby. The doctor will weigh the baby, check their height and head growth, listen to the heart and lungs, and feel the baby's abdomen. Even if your baby has allergic colitis, the abdomen shouldn't be distended or painful to the touch. The doctor will probably also look for a rash or small tears around the anus that could be causing the bloody stools.While there is no diagnostic lab test for allergic colitis, the doctor may want to draw and check your baby's blood to determine blood loss amounts. This can also inform the doctor about protein levels in the blood.
The doctor may also check stool samples to be sure the baby doesn't have an infection causing bloody stools.

, The doctor may give a diagnosis of mild allergic colitis if your baby does have some bloody stools, but isn't experiencing vomiting or abdominal pain. Your baby will probably be growing at a healthy weight and will have stable protein levels in the blood test. The doctor may diagnose your baby with severe allergic colitis if the baby isn't growing (or is losing weight), has a lot of blood in the stools, or has protein loss according to the blood test., Once the doctor has determined if your baby has mild to moderate or severe allergic colitis, the doctor will talk about immediate changes to your baby's diet. Depending on how severe your baby's symptoms are, your baby will need to be reevaluated after a few weeks to monitor progress.You should notice an improvement in the baby's symptoms 72 to 96 hours after removing the allergen from your baby's diet.

Something as simple as switching to baby clothes made of organic cotton can help alleviate eczema symptoms.,
Always go for comfort when shopping for clothes.,
Baby eczema can get worse when in skin is often in contact with ill-fitting clothes.,
Lastly, make sure your baby is not in contact with things that can aggravate his condition.",How to Cure Baby Eczema," Organic cotton does not contain any of those chemicals that help speed up growth and boost production. Regular cotton cloths are tainted with pesticides and dyes.;
, Comfortable clothes do not have to be expensive. You just have to ensure a good fit. Your baby won't be able to move well in baggy or tight-fitting clothes. Itchy neck labels and embroidered designs add discomfort as well. Look for seamless or flat seamed designs that are less bulky and are easier to move around in.

, As a general rule, baby clothes should fit close enough to the skin but not too tightly that it pinches the skin. There should be enough room to allow the baby to move. Avoid big clothes as the extra fabric rubs against the skin, causing further irritation and redness.

, Trade your regular soap and shampoo for organic ones. Organic soap and shampoo have no harsh ingredients that can strip off moisture and natural oils from your baby's skin. Wash his clothes with a mild detergent. If possible, avoid using too much product on your baby's skin and wash him only when necessary. Wetness aggravates baby eczema so make sure to dry him off completely after each wash.

Avoid skincare products with fragrances.,
Avoid antibacterial soap, which could contain harmful chemicals such as triclosan.Use baby wash instead.Most of the time, you won't even need soap to clean your baby — try to limit its use to once a day, or once every few days.

,
Use your hands or cotton balls and water instead of baby wipes.,
Remember less is more.,
Choose natural fabrics for your baby’s clothes.,
Use a baby-specific detergent to do your laundry.,

Wash your baby.",How to Care for Babies With Sensitive Skin," The chemicals used to produce these fragrances are among the top causes of allergic reactions and irritations, and may provoke a response from your baby’s skin.Look for baby care products labeled ""hypoallergenic."";
,, There is no need to scrub the skin hard: skin cells fall off naturally as they age. Gentle washing of the child with your hands is usually all that is necessary unless the baby's skin is soiled. In that case, try the cotton balls. Once your baby is two to four weeks old, you can try alcohol- and perfume-free baby wipes, but watch to see if they irritate your baby's skin. You may find that cotton balls or a soft cloth with warm water are still your best option.

, Particularly with newborn babies, there is no need to use soaps or shampoos at all when cleaning them. Use warm water instead.Your baby has very effective, naturally occurring defenses, and washing her too often could remove these protective substances.


Human skin is naturally oily and this is a protective substance that preserves the skin integrity and should not be mistaken for unhygienic skin.

, Fabrics such as linen and cotton will allows the skin to breathe. Ensure that the clothes don’t fit tightly or rub against the skin, as that may cause blistering.Avoid the temptation to wrap your infant in too many clothes. Let his skin breathe and allow the skin to cool naturally. The same goes for bedtime.

, These will have been designed specifically to prevent irritating sensitive skin.Carry out some research online to see which brands are best for your needs, or ask your healthcare provider or local chemist.

, Changing your baby’s diaper or nappy as soon as she soils herself will help to prevent painful rashes from developing. Depending on your baby’s age, a nappy change may need to be carried out anywhere between six and twelve times a day.When your baby wets herself, be sure to clean the whole area gently, using cotton wool and warm water, and cleaning inside folds of skin.
If your baby has a bowel movement, you will still want to use water only if possible. If it's a particularly large or sticky bowel movement, or you were unable to change her immediately, use gentle soap, or alcohol and perfume-free wipes.
If the temperature is sufficiently warm, your baby can lie on the changing mat without a diaper on. Let her lie in the sun for a few minutes and dry naturally. Giving your baby a break from wearing a nappy all the time can reduce the risk of a rash developing.

, Some rashes your baby develops might be caused by the food he is eating. If he develops rashes after eating, remove the suspected food from your baby's diet and see if the rash recurs.If it does, continue removing one food at a time to see which, if any, are causing the rash.
Consult with your pediatrician to determine if a food allergy is causing your baby's skin to flare up.
At the same time, as your baby ages, don't be overprotective in terms of exposure to many different things. Allow him to pet the family dog or cat or play on the clean floor. This exposes him to surface bacteria that is beneficial to building a strong immune system.

, When it comes to washing your baby, less is more. Rather than give her a bath every day, you can ‘top and tail’ her – that is, wash her face, neck, hands and bottom carefully. Most doctors recommend a full bath two to three times a week.Always check the temperature on your water heater and make certain it is below 120°F (48.9°C). Many infants and children get scalded each year from parents forgetting to lower the heater temperature. Hot water is also more likely to dry out a baby's skin than warm water.

, Keep your baby’s bathtime short, typically under 20 minutes, because spending too much time in the bath can reduce natural oils and increase the risk of irritating his skin., Cover your baby’s body and ensure she is wearing a wide-brimmed hat. Again, loose cotton clothes are a good choice here. Keep your baby in shade.Very young babies should not use sunscreen. Instead, keep them out of direct sunlight altogether, particularly in the middle of the day.After the first six months, sunscreen is a viable option. Use plenty of broad-spectrum sunscreen, and reapply it often.Consult with your healthcare provider if you have any doubts about whether or not sunscreen is right for your child.
When selecting a sunscreen, look for one especially designed for babies with an SPF of 30 or higher.

, A rash may be a sign of a wider problem if your baby seems ill. If you become concerned, call your paediatrician. He will be able to provide diagnosis and advice. There are many possible reasons for your baby to develop a rash, and your paediatrician should be able to tell you whether your child has a skin condition or whether the rash has another cause such as an infection.


Babies that have very sensitive or dry skin, or that otherwise experience frequent or severe rashes may have eczema. Your Pediatrician can provide advice and medication if they find this to be a concern with your child.

, Many skin rashes a baby will develop are harmless, and will go away on their own.


This is particularly common with newborn babies. Erythema toxicum, a blotchy red skin reaction usually developed a few days after birth, will usually clear after a few days. Milia, tiny white spots on a newborn's face, will clear after a few weeks.If your baby develops sweat or heat rash, which is characterized by tiny red bumps or blisters, these will clear without treatment, but you should endeavour to reduce the amount of clothing your baby wears and put her in a more temperate environment.

, In some cases, washing the part of your baby upon which the rash has developed in warm water can help improve your baby's skin condition.


If your baby develops cradle cap, which is characterized by large and greasy yellow and brown scales, wash your baby's hair and scalp with water and baby shampoo. This will help prevent a build-up of scales. You can also gently massage your baby's scalp with your fingers or a soft baby brush after bathing.If your baby develops baby acne, wash your baby's face with water and a mild moisturizer. This will help improve its appearance. Do not use acne medicine for adults or older children. Contact your pediatrician if it becomes severe or does not clear up."

Be on the lookout for sudden ear pain.,
Be suspicious if your baby is more irritable than usual.,
Watch out for poor hearing or response to sounds.,
Check for a fever.,
Consult with your family physician or pediatrician.,
Ask your doctor about the pros and cons of antibiotics.,
Get a referral to a specialist.",How to Determine if Your Infant Has an Ear Infection," The hallmark symptom of a middle ear infection is a quick onset of ear pain due to fluid buildup from an inflammatory reaction.The pain will likely make your infant cry ""out of the blue"" with little warning of discomfort. The pain is usually worse when lying down, particularly when the infected ear is touching the pillow, so difficulty sleeping is to be expected also.


Try to have your infant sleep on his back with the head of the bed propped up so the ear pain is not exacerbated.
In addition to crying in response to the pain, your infant may also tug or pull at his ear — so be on the lookout for that as an indicator of discomfort.;
, Aside from crying more, your infant may show other nonverbal signs of discomfort such as being fussy or irritable or showing signs of a cold.This irritable stage usually precedes the crying stage by a few hours and may coincide with waking up early from a nap or not being able to get to sleep to start with. As inflammation builds in the ear, a feeling of pressure or fullness increases, culminating in sharp, throbbing pain. Headaches are also common, which can compound an infant's discomfort and make her pretty unhappy about things — especially since she can't verbally communicate very well.


A middle ear infection is usually preceded by a sore throat, cold, or other upper respiratory issue (allergy). The infection or mucous is then transferred to the middle ear secondarily via the Eustachian tubes, which run from the ears to the back of the throat.
Some infants with an ear infection may vomit as well or even have diarrhea.
In addition to bacteria, viruses and allergic reactions to food (milk) and environmental triggers can also lead to infections that eventually spread to the middle ear.

, As the middle ear fills up with fluid and/or mucous, the ability to transmit sound is hampered.As a result, watch for signs of poor hearing, not being attentive, or not responding to loud sounds. Call your infant's name or clap your hands and see if he looks at you. If he doesn't, that could be a sign of an ear infection, particularly if he appears fussy or cranky.


In addition to temporarily reduced hearing, your infant may also appear to have a lack of normal balance. Structures in the inner ear are responsible for balance, so inflammation can affect their function. Pay attention to how your infant crawls or sits — if he leans to one side or falls over, that could indicate an ear infection.
Children get more ear infections compared to adults because their immune systems are not as developed and their Eustachian tubes are smaller and less inclined — making them susceptible to getting congested and no draining properly., Fevers are a sign that the body is trying to make it difficult for pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) to reproduce and spread because most don't thrive in higher temperatures. As such, most fevers are beneficial, but they are a good indication that your infant is fighting something inside. Monitor your infant's temperature with a thermometer. A temperature of 100°F (37.7°C) or higher is typical for ear infections (and many other conditions too).Avoid measuring your infant's temperature with an infrared ear thermometer if you suspect an ear infection. The build up of warm fluid (inflammation) in the inner ear heats up the eardrum and produces inaccurate readings that are too high. Instead, use a standard thermometer under the armpit or over the forehead, or use a rectal thermometer if you want to be very accurate.
Expect other typical signs and symptoms to accompany a fever such as loss of appetite, flushed skin (especially on the face), increased thirst, irritability.

, If you've noticed any of the above signs and symptoms lingering for a few days (and your parental instincts are tingling!), then make an appointment with the doctor. It's the best way to truly determine if your infant has an ear infection or any other condition that needs medical attention. Your doctor will use a lighted instrument called an otoscope to look at your infant's eardrum. A red, bulging eardrum indicates a middle ear infection.Your doctor may also use a special pneumatic otoscope, which blows a puff of air into the outer ear canal against the eardrum. A normal eardrum moves back and forth in response to the air current, whereas an eardrum with fluid behind it doesn't move much, if at all.
A sign that an ear infection is likely more serious or advanced is if you observe a discharge of fluid, pus or blood from your infant's ear.In this case, you should consider bringing your child to an emergency clinic or urgent care clinic right away instead of waiting to schedule an appointment with your doctor. (Do check with your doctor first, as she may be able to see your child right away.)

, In actuality, most ear infections in infants/children resolve without any treatment, such as antibiotics.What's best for your infant depends on many factors, including her age and severity of symptoms. Childhood ear infections usually improve within the first couple of days and most clear up without antibiotics within one to two weeks. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend a wait-and-see approach if: your infant over six months appears to have mild ear pain in one ear for less than 48 hours and a fever less than 102.2°F (39°C).Amoxicillin is an antibiotic commonly prescribed to children with ear infections — it's meant to be taken over seven to 10 days.
Keep in mind that antibiotics are only helpful for bacterial infections and not viral or fungal infections, or allergic reactions.
The downside to antibiotics is that if they don't clear out the infection entirely; they can create resistant strains of bacteria that create even worse infections.
Antibiotics also kill the ""good"" bacteria of the GI tract, which can lead to digestive problems and diarrhea.
An alternative to antibiotics is medicated ear drops combined with small doses of acetaminophen given orally.

, You'll likely be referred to a specialist in ear, nose and throat conditions (otolaryngologist) if your infant's problem has persisted for some time, he is not responding to treatment, or the ear infection has occurred frequently. Most childhood ear infections don't cause long-term problems, but frequent or persistent infections can result in serious complications, such as impaired hearing, developmental delays (such as speech), widespread infection or tearing/perforation of the eardrum.Torn or perforated eardrums can heal on their own, but occasionally require surgery.
If your infant has recurrent ear infections (three episodes in six months or four episodes within a year), the specialist may recommend a procedure (myringotomy) to drain fluid from the middle ear via a small tube.
Tubes stay in the ear drum to prevent further build up of fluid and ear infections. The tube usually falls out on it's own in about one year.
If placing tubes through the eardrum still doesn’t prevent ear infections, the otolaryngologist may consider removing the adenoids (they sit behind the nose and above the roof of the mouth) to prevent infection from spreading via the Eustachian tubes."

Keep track of urination.",How to Clean a Circumcision," After every diaper change, make sure that no stool or urine remain on the circumcision area. Gently clean it with a soft cloth soaked with water and a mild baby soap, then dab it with a clean, wet cloth to rinse. Avoid using baby wipes on the area for at least the first 7-10 days as they may be abrasive and cause your baby pain., After cleaning, allow the circumcision area to air dry on its own. Towel drying can cause irritation to the wound while it is healing. If you give your baby a sponge bath, gently dry the rest of their body with a towel and avoid the circumcision area., To prevent infection or irritation, check your baby's diaper frequently. Newborns may urinate 20 times a day, so check your baby's diaper every 2-3 hours (also when the baby cries, or you just sense a change is needed) to make sure it is not wet or soiled.Urine and stool may cause an infection to the circumcision wound if left for too long., During the 7-10 days that your baby's circumcised penis is healing, avoid submerging it in water. Give your baby sponge baths with water and a mild baby soap. Wash your baby's head, face, and body separately, making sure to dry each area and cover your baby between parts to keep them warm., While your baby's circumcision is healing, dress it to keep your baby's diaper from rubbing against it. Follow your doctor's instructions, but usually after cleaning and air drying, gently cover the wound area with vaseline to keep anything from sticking to it. Your doctor may also recommend wrapping a small piece of gauze around the circumcision before putting on your baby's diaper., During the first 48 hours after an adult circumcision, avoid getting the wound wet by skipping a bath or shower. Instead, clean up with a wet cloth or towel, avoiding the bandaged area. The circumcision wound should be watertight after 48 hours., The bandage and gauze applied by the doctor after the circumcision should be removed 48 hours after the procedure by soaking the area in a shallow bath. Fill a bath or basin with warm water and salt (epsom salt or regular table salt) to promote healing. Let the water soak the bandage long enough to allow you to remove it without pieces of gauze sticking to the wound.Only soak the area long enough to remove all the dried blood and gauze fibers from the area, then pat it dry gently with clean gauze.

, Change your bandages every 24-48 hours, or if they get wet. A few drops of urine can be overlooked, but liquid that saturates through the bandage will be cause for a new dressing. Apply a small amount of vaseline to the glans and shaft of the penis to prevent the bandage from sticking to the skin., While a shower can be safe for the circumcised penis after 48 hours, the wound should not be submerged in a bath until it is healed (with the exception of removing the initial dressing). Taking a bath can wash bacteria into the wound, which may cause an infection. Initial healing normally takes 2-3 weeks, though healing time may vary depending on an individual's age, lifestyle, and medical history., When showering during the time the circumcised penis is healing, avoid letting the shower stream hit the wound directly. Shelter the wound site with your hand to prevent injury. Your hand will absorb the force of the water while still allowing the area to get wet., Check the wound site for signs of redness and swelling. Redness and swelling of the circumcision area are both normal during the 7-10 days it takes to heal. If the area grows redder or more swollen 5-10 days after the procedure, or if the area seems warm or more painful, contact your doctor since this could indicate an infection.Call your pediatrician right away if your baby has a fever (100.4° F or higher rectally), he will need to be seen immediately., Check for signs of blood during the first few days after the circumcision. A few drops of blood (smaller than the size of a quarter) are normal during this period. Larger drops of blood, and more persistent bleeding, are signs for concern and warrant an immediate call to your doctor or child's pediatrician., A small amount of scabbing and yellow discharge is normal during the healing process, but it is a cause for concern if it lasts longer than a week. Also note if the discharge is green, has a bad smell or is increasing in amount as this can be signs of an infection. Check the circumcision site carefully for discharge. If you see any 7 days after the procedure, contact your pediatrician., While a small amount of scabbing is normal while the circumcision site heals, you should not see any sores around the area. Check the wound for sores, and contact your doctor immediately if you see any. Crusty, fluid-filled sores may be a sign of infection., In the case of both newborn and adult circumcisions, a problem with urination is an important warning sign of complications or an infection. If your newborn does not urinate within 6-8 hours of the procedure, call your pediatrician immediately. If there is any pain or difficulty urinating following an adult circumcision, contact your doctor right away."

If the baby starts crying, check his or her diaper. If there is poop, or if the diaper is wet, the diaper needs to be changed. Get a fresh diaper before undoing the old one. To Change a diaper, get out baby wipes, a fresh diaper, and something to keep the baby occupied while you change it. Wash your hands to avoid spreading germs, dirt, and bacteria, to the baby's fragile bottom. First, undo the diaper. Second, if the baby is male, place a clean diaper over his private area. If the baby is female, make sure to wipe front to back so you don't spread bacteria. Third, wipe the baby with as many wipes as you need, making sure to get into all the creases. Last, lift the baby's feet, remove the soiled diaper, and slide on a clean one. Latch the diaper, pattern side on front. Wash your hands gain, to wash off any pee or poop and to kill germs and bacteria so that they don't spread to other places in the house. Make sure that the baby's hands and feet are clean and free of any pee or poop after the diaper change.
If the baby is still crying, that often means that the baby is hungry. So you will have to find the bottle and heat up the milk that the mother has told you to use. Remember, use one scoop of formula for every two ounces. Shake well. Then heat. Do not heat a bottle up in a microwave--microwaves can cause pockets of scalding hot milk. Place the bottle in a pot on the stove and heat the water. After heating up the bottle, make sure the bottle cap is securely fastened and shake the bottle well. Then squirt some of the milk onto the meat of your wrist and if the milk is too hot, continue to shake the bottle until the milk isn't too hot anymore. Once the milk is ready for the baby to drink, prop the baby up and gently stick the rubber nipple into the baby's mouth. Do not point the nipple straight down because the baby could choke. Take breaks between sips. During breaks, sit the baby up and gently pat his/her back right between their shoulder blades. The baby will usually burp.

, If the baby food is too watery, mix in a tablespoon of baby rice, if it has been approved by the parent. Next, put a bib on the baby and place them in their high chair. Never leave the baby unattended in the chair. Fill a small spoon halfway with baby food, and gently put spoon in mouth. Do not force in the spoon. If it gags on the food or dodges the spoon, it is probably full.

, At the beginning of the evening, you will have some time for play. This should be gentle and at the baby's pace. Keep small objects away from the baby and be sure to watch what he or she puts into the mouth. Feet are okay!

Try singing songs. Try ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" or ""An Itsy Bitsy Spider."" Look into the infant's eyes as you sing.
Hold a baby toy a few inches away from there face. Try moving the toy back and forth. Younger infants will watch the toy with their eyes, older infants will actually reach and grab the toy.
Dance! Cradle the baby in your arms and gently move from side to side and sway to the music. Any music will do as long as it is not loud or inappropriate. Avoid this right after eating, wait about a half an hour after eating before trying this activity.
Action rhymes and games are fun. Try ""Hickory Dickory Dock."" Move your fingers up the baby's body while you say the rhyme.
Pinwheels are nice. Hold the pinwheel 6 inches away from baby's face. Blow on it and watch the pretty colors!
If the infant has an activity quilt that they can lay on, an activity gym, a baby bouncer, or a baby swing, lay them or sit the in one of these. Try pointing out the toys and activities, and encouraging interaction. Gently bounce or swing a baby if they are in a swing or bouncer, this calms them and helps them learn the difference between cause and effect, trust, and body awareness.
Take a walk. Avoid a walk if it is over 85 degrees out, or if it is below 30 degrees. Also avoid a walk if it is around the time when mosquitos are high. Place the infant in a stroller and strap them in for safety. Slowly walk and push the stroller. Point out items in nature such as: ""Look! There's a duck!"" Let baby feel items outside such as the cold snow or tickle grass on their tummy or feet.
Read books. Books for infants should be cloth or board books to avoid infants from chewing up the pages or tearing them out. Many, bright, pictures with little script are best. When the infant, starts to loose interest, stop reading, even if you are in the middle of the book, and move on to something else.
Try mirrors! Use unbreakable mirrors made for children. Hold the mirror in front of baby and let them see themselves for a while. Then, sit them on your lap and hold the mirror in front of both of you. Make faces such as silly, a frown, a smile, and twitching your nose.

, Then, gently lift the infant under its arms and bottom, and place it in tub. Do not lay the baby down! Next, with a washcloth, pat on infant safe body wash. Still be sure to get into every roll and crease. Rinse, but do not pour water over his/her face. Next, to wash the baby's head, do the same, but VERY VERY gently. Rinse with washcloth. When you are finished, dry the baby with a soft towel, and apply lotion.

, Let the baby drink more milk. Then pat the baby to make it burp.

, Try holding the baby in your arms and slowly swinging the baby back and forth, or holding the baby securely while walking around with a bouncy step, or rocking in a rocking chair. If the baby won't go to sleep, gently lift the baby up and lay the baby in its crib.


NEVER leave a baby in its crib on its back with its bottle in its hands because the baby could choke. After the baby is asleep, sit in the baby's room with it and wait to make sure the baby will stay asleep, and that the baby's sleep environment is safe --
Make sure there is nothing that the baby could play with in the crib. It could distract the baby and it won't want to go to sleep. Also, soft toys should never be in a crib, because a baby could suffocate. Keep big, fluffy blankets or pillows out of the crib. Babies don't really need them and they are actually dangerous. Keep bed covers away from baby's face.
Do not lie a baby on its tummy, ever, even if the parent tells you too. Always place it on its back. Placing it on its tummy is very dangerous, and potentially fatal. (If the baby is old enough to flip itself over on it's tummy by itself, though, it's okay if he flips himself over).

, This is very important as it is your babysitting duty to make sure that the baby is safe, is not fussing, is not too hot or cold and does not have a dirty diaper. Use a baby monitor if one is provided.

Games like hide and seek or peek-a-boo are excellent for helping babies learn that separation is only temporary., You can help your baby get used to the idea of not always being by your side by encouraging him to explore his world independently. If your baby gets used to being in a room at home without you, it may be easier to adjust to being somewhere else without you too.Make sure there is nothing dangerous that your baby can get into before allowing him to explore. While it's good to allow some independence, it should always be controlled.

, Your baby will be much more comfortable exploring the world and spending time away from you if he feels safe and secure. Help him feel this way by making sure all of his basic needs are met.Feed him whenever he is hungry.
Change his diapers whenever they are dirty.
Give him love and attention when you are together.

, Regular routines give your baby a sense of consistency, which helps him feel secure. Try to stick to regular routines as much as possible, as abrupt changes are likely to cause anxiety.Be especially careful about maintaining everyday routines after big changes, like a move or the birth of a sibling.

, If your baby struggles with separation anxiety, try leaving him with a caretaker for very short periods of time and gradually working up to longer intervals. This will help your baby understand that the separation is only temporary.The first few times can be as short as 15 minutes.
Try to make sure your baby isn't tired or hungry before you leave, as this can make him more anxious., If you want to reduce your baby's separation anxiety, try to avoid leaving him in an unfamiliar place or with unfamiliar people. The more comfortable your baby is with his surroundings and caretakers, the less severe his separation anxiety is likely to be.Leave your baby with family members whenever possible.
If you will be using a new babysitter, have him or her come over to get to know the baby while you are home before leaving them alone.
If your baby will be going to daycare, try bringing him for a few visits without leaving. Once he is used to the place, it should be easier to leave him there.

, If your baby sees that you are upset about the separation, he is much more likely to get upset about it too. To avoid this, keep it together when dropping your baby off at daycare or with the babysitter, and do your best to not let your baby see any concern on your face.It's also good for your baby to see that you like the caretaker, so always try to smile when talking with him or her.
You may also want to reassure your baby by letting him know how much fun he will have while you're gone.
Try to ignore your baby's crying as you leave. If you delay leaving to comfort him, you are teaching your baby that he can prevent you from leaving by crying., It's a good idea to get into the habit of telling your baby where you are going and when you will be coming back. This can help him feel less anxious about the separation.While it's good to say goodbye before you leave, don't make too big of a deal out of it, or else your baby may sense that you are hesitant to leave.
Never sneak out without saying goodbye, as this can create more anxiety.
Make sure you keep your promises and return when you said you would.

, When you return from a separation, let your baby know that you are happy to see him. Making the reunion a happy occasion can help make the separation a little easier too.Pay attention to what your baby wants when you return. If he wants a hug, give him a hug. If he wants to play, play.

, Get your baby used to the idea of going to bed and taking naps by following the same predictable routine each time. The more familiar the routine becomes, the less scary it will be for your baby to be away from you at night.Stick to the same bedtime each night as much as possible.
Try incorporating an enjoyable activity into your routine so that your baby will look forward to bedtime. You may want to read a story or play a game.

, If your baby cries for you in the middle of the night, you can check in on him, but avoid playing with him or giving him too much attention, which may encourage him to keep crying out for you. Your purpose should be simply to reassure your baby that you are still in the house and to make sure everything is okay.If you don't respond to your baby's cries at all, he may think that you are not nearby, which can increase his anxiety.

, You may be very tempted to start sleeping in your baby's room to help ease his nighttime anxiety, but this will only make matters worse. When you do this, you remove the separation, which means your baby will never get used to being away from you.Avoid any other accommodations that you don't want to become habits as well.

, If you are always home with your baby during the day, you may need to start making some changes. Even small separations during the day can help decrease nighttime separation anxiety, as your baby will get more comfortable with being away from you each time.Try short visits with family members or a few hours at daycare each week.

Use glue to attach the velcro.,
Put your lexan sheet in place.",How to Babyproof Windows2," Some windows are designed in an unusual fashion and do not follow the crank or sliding opening pattern. Luckily, there is a method you can use that works for most windows. You'll need the following supplies, all of which can be purchased online or at a hardware store:


Measuring tape
Velcro strip
Glue
Lexan sheetIf you cannot find a lexan sheet, try another see-through plastic or light glass. Someone at the hardware store should be able to point you in the right direction.
The advantage of a clear window guard is not limited to the fact it fits on most windows. A clear window guard also lets in light, preventing your home from feeling dark or dreary due to a window guard.

, You will be attaching a lexan sheet inside your window using velcro. In order to determine how big of a sheet you'll need, measure your window vertically and horizontally. Write down these dimensions., Take your lexan sheet to a hardware store. Ask a worker to cut the sheet in the dimensions of your window. As a lexan sheet is made of plastic, it can be dangerous to attempt to cut it yourself unless you have experience working in hardware., Attach four strips of velcro along each side of your lexan sheet. Then, attach four strips of velcro hooks along the side of your window. Use your glue to attach the velcro. As a child is not very strong, simple craft glue should be strong enough to keep your lexan sheet in place.With very young children, velcro should be strong enough to hold the windows in place. Also, as the sheet is fit so tightly in the window, it would be difficult for a child to get a grip on the Lexan sheet to begin with.
If your children are older, consider screwing the lexan sheet into the window frames. If you're renting, you should check with your landlord before drilling into the window.

, Once the glue has dried, place your lexan sheet into the window. It will now be hard for your child to slide or push open your window, as there is a guard in place. The advantage of lexan is that it also lets light through, avoiding your room becoming dark due to a window guard.If you want to let airflow in through the window, consider drilling holes through the plastic with a power drill. Read the manufacturer's instructions on your lexan sheet first, however, to make sure you take proper safety precautions for the brand of lexan you're using."

Check your state's regulations.,
Choose the correct type of window guard.,
Obtain one-way screws.,
Have a professional install the window guard.",How to Babyproof Windows3," Window guards are metallic devices installed in the lower half of windows that slide open vertically.

However, if you have a child under 10 living with you, a window guard may be mandatory by law. This varies by city and state. You can check your state's government website to find out your state's regulations. This is usually under the Department of Public Safety.A window guard is not easy to install. Some states may actually require professional installation. An improperly installed window guard can easily be removed by a child.

, Window guards come in many shapes and sizes. However, you should make sure you choose a window guard that's safe for your type of window.


A safe window guard should be at least 15 inches tall. The bars in the window guard should be close enough together that a 5-inch ball cannot pass through. A window bar that does not meet these regulations is not considered safe. It also may not legally count as a window guard by your state, which could land you in legal trouble depending on your state's regulations.Some states, such as New York, have a list of approved window guard manufacturers. You should check to see if your state has such a list before selecting a window guard.When purchasing a window guard, you should make sure the guard is safe for your specific type of windows. Somewhere on the ordering form or box containing the guard, it should specify what type of window this guard is compatible with. You can purchase a window guard online or at a local hardware store., In order to be safe, window guards should not come off easily.

Do not use toothpaste. Use only water.

, Once your baby’s first tooth appears, start brushing your baby's teeth once a day. At this stage you’ll only need to use a tiny amount of toothpaste (about the size of a grain of rice) and water.Use fluoride toothpaste made specifically for infants or children when brushing your baby’s teeth. Look for fluoride toothpaste that has the American Dental Association’s (ADA) or Canadian Dental Association’s (CDA) seal of acceptance somewhere on the package.
Continue to wipe your baby’s gums in-between where teeth are growing.

, Once your baby has teeth that are located side-by-side and are touching, you can start to floss your baby's teeth regularly., One of the easiest ways to brush your baby’s teeth is to have your baby sit on your lap facing forward. Your baby’s head can then rest back against your chest. This puts you in the same position as if you were brushing your own teeth, which will make the process a lot easier.Brush your baby’s teeth using small circles.
Once your baby gets too big to sit on your lap, have your child stand in front of you (on a stool if required). Your child’s head should be tilted up slightly so you can easily see all her teeth.

, While it may be convenient, you should not put your baby to bed with a bottle and allow him to fall asleep with it. The sugar from the milk or juice in the bottle can harm your baby’s enamel.This is also referred to as bottle mouth.
A sure sign of bottle mouth is when your baby’s front teeth are pocked, pitted, or discoloured.
Unfortunately if a severe case of bottle mouth develops, teeth may need to be removed before they fall out naturally.
On the whole, it's best not to put juice in a bottle at any time, and to limit juice given to babies.

, In general, you can wait to take your baby to the dentist either at one year old, or when the first tooth has grown in, whichever happens first. Your dentist will then be able to show you preventative care tips to ensure your baby’s mouth and teeth stay strong and healthy for life."

Forge a healthy bond with a special needs baby.",How to Bond With Your Baby," Bonding with your baby doesn't just happen overnight. In fact, it’s a process. It can happen at birth or even a few weeks or months later, sometimes in the process of everyday caregiving. At some point, you’ll realized how much you love your baby and want to protect him or her.Recognize that is it normal to not bond immediately and to even have negative feelings about your baby.As long as your negative feelings don’t manifest themselves as wanting to hurt your baby, this is fine. If you do want to hurt your baby, seek immediate medical attention.
Remember to be patient and understanding with your partner. Every parent has a different experience bonding with a baby. Your partner may bond immediately with your baby or it might take longer. In either case, try to focus on your bond with your baby rather than on your partner's bond with your baby.
Avoid concern if you are an adoptive parent. Bonding with your baby may take a bit longer, but the process is the same as with biological parents.;
, Everything you do during pregnancy, from diet to managing stress, has an impact on your baby. Because of this, it’s a good idea to start the bonding process while you or your partner is pregnant. This can be as simple as talking, singing, or reading to the baby in utero. Make sure to let your partner know when the baby is kicking and moving so that he or she can feel it, which may help establish an early bond.Consider putting your baby’s nursery or a designated sleeping area together with your baby. Making decisions about the baby together and taking these early care steps can promote bonding during pregnancy and once the baby arrives.

, Touch is an early type of language between a baby and parents. It soothes both of you and can also promote healthy growth and development. Cradle, hold, and touch your baby as often as you can to help establish the bond.Give your baby “skin to skin” contact if you can. This means holding your baby’s bare skin directly against your own bare skin during feeding or cradling times. You can start this as early as following delivery.
Rock and stroke your baby during feeding and cradling times. Make sure to keep both gentle so that you don’t harm or startle your baby.
Recognize that touch is especially important for premature babies and those with medical problems. If you can’t hold your baby, ask the doctor if you can touch him or her or even try to give a gentle massage in the isolette.

, Since touch is so important to your baby’s development and aiding the bonding process, incorporate a massage into your daily activities.Not only can this promote bonding and relaxation, but it can also move trapped gas in your baby’s belly.Use a cold fruit or vegetable oil to massage your baby such as olive, grape seed, apricot, avocado, or safflower. Rub it between your hands to warm it before application. Stay away from baby and mineral oils, which can clog your baby’s pores.Make sure the room is at least 75 degrees so that your baby doesn’t get cold during the massage. Consider adding some soothing music in the background.
Make sure you talk to your baby during the massage. Your voice can soothe her and helps further promote your bond.
Start by massaging your baby’s legs and feet and gently squeeze the leg as you make your way down. Then move to your baby’s belly and chest by drawing an oval below his or her belly button and then gently making circles with your hands. Make sure to get your baby’s arms, which you can massage just like the legs. Flip your baby over and stroke his or her back from side to side followed by up and down. Finally, do the face and head by stroking the cheeks and drawing tiny circles with your fingertips all over both.
Listen to your baby’s mood. If he or she isn’t into the massage, try again later in the day.

, Hearing your voice is important to the development of your baby’s nervous system. It also can soothe and calm your baby, which can promote bonding. Talk, sing, and read to your baby whenever you have the chance.Respond to your baby’s babbles or coos to let him or her know you hear it. Say, “what’s that, Christopher, you want to hear some music? Ok, let’s listen to some waves on the beach.” You could also use this opportunity to sing your child a favorite song. Make sure to keep the mood light and happy and laugh when you get a chance.Talk to your baby whenever you are feeding, changing, or bathing him or her. This not only helps to soothe him or her, but helps promote the bond for both of you.
Read to your baby as a part of your daily or bedtime routine.

, Whenever you are interacting with your baby, it’s important to maintain eye-to-eye contact. This can reinforce your bonding process with your baby as well as promote his or her overall development and well-being.Realize it may take your baby up to 4 weeks to be able to focus on you. In the meantime, follow your baby’s eyes and make sure to catch his or her gaze as you can.

, The process of bonding also occurs naturally through regular care. Making sure that you include your partner in the daily care of your baby can promote or enhance the bonding process for him or her as well.Be open and honest with your partner about why you’re including him or her. For example, if your partner balks at changing a diaper say, “I asked you to help me because this helps us bond with Susanna.”
Remember that trading off and on with daily care can also help you and your partner form individual bonds with your baby.

, Most babies cry and get cranky at some point. Calming your baby when he or she cries can not only calm down him or her, but also promote the bonding process.Stroke or touch your baby’s skin and speak in a soft voice. Looking in your baby’s eyes may also help calm him or her while enhancing your bond. Don’t make any sudden movements or loud noises to prevent startling your baby.

, Eating is key to a happy and healthy baby. It’s also a natural and optimal time to bond with your baby because he or she will respond to your smell and touch. Feed your baby on a schedule and according to his or her age, which can help your baby grow and enjoy spending time with you.



breast or bottle feed to further establish your bond with the baby.It doesn’t matter if you breast or bottle feed, a loving parent will always create a special bond with your baby.Use your feeding session to use other bonding techniques such as touching, stroking, talking, and maintaining eye contact. Consider massaging your baby’s belly to help relieve air in the system, which can further strengthen your bond.Remember that bottle-feeding can be a great experience for your partner, too.

, Making sure your baby has clean diapers promotes health and happiness, but it also presents another opportunity to bond with your baby. Use this time to talk and touch your baby, even making jokes with him or her about the diaper.Consider allowing your partner to participate in diaper changing sessions or switch on and off, since this is also a great bonding chance for him or her, too.


Lay your baby down on a comfy diaper pad and make sure not leave him or her to prevent falling.Remove the dirty diaper and gently wipe your baby’s genital area clean with wipes or a pre-moistened washcloth. Put on the new diaper and apply any ointments you want before sealing the diaper. During this process, have a “conversation” with your baby. Laugh with him or her about the diaper. This can help sooth and promote the bond with your baby. You can also consider using this time to give your baby a mini massage on the legs or belly.

, Your baby needs a bath a couple of times every week and, in some cases, if he or she has a diaper blowout. Since touch and massaging actions are a part of bath time, it’s an optimal chance to work on the bonding process.Use bath time to strengthen the bond between you, your partner, and your baby.


Have everything you need for bath time ready: a washcloth, towel with a hood, mild baby shampoo and soap, baby wipes, a clean diaper, and clean clothes ready. Preparation can keep the mood light and help you focus on the bonding experience.
Fill the tub with 2-3 inches (5-8 centimeters) of water that’s between 100F (38 degrees Celsius) and 120F (49C) to prevent scalding. Keep pouring it over your baby during the bath so he or she stays warm and say something like, “that feels good, doesn’t it, Teresa?”
Use your free hand to stroke and touch your baby. Give him or her a massage either during or after the bath.Consider putting on some soothing music or singing to the baby during the bath.
Wrap your baby in a hooded towel so he or she stays warm and cozy. Rub the baby’s back while you’re drying him or her off. , Nightly bedtime rituals not only help prepare your baby to sleep, but they also present a great opportunity to use a variety of different bonding techniques. Giving your baby a bath, feeding him or her, reading a story, singing, or having a soothing “conversation” can cue your baby to go to sleep and further establish your bond.Read or sing to your baby to calm him or her as he or she drifts off to sleep.
Give the baby a warm bath with a gentle massage before bed to promote sleepiness., Parents often feel overwhelmed when caring for a baby, especially if it is their first one. Remember that it’s important to care for yourself, though, too. This can help you better bond to your baby. Don’t be bashful about asking your partner, friends, or family to give you occasional help.Remember that most people love babies and will probably love to help you. If you don’t have any close friends or family to help you, your doctor or local hospital may help you find someone to help you.

, In some cases, you may find it difficult to bond with your baby at all. If you don’t think that you’re bonding with your baby at his or her first office visit, talk to the doctor about your feelings. He or she can figure out if there are underlying issues causing the lack of bond.Recognize that you may have difficulty bonding with your baby because of one of the following factors: adjusting early mental pictures of your child to the reality, hormones, postpartum depression, exhaustion and pain from a long delivery, your baby being in an isolette.
Realize that your baby may also have trouble bonding. This can be a result of premature birth and a parent’s inability to touch and access the baby., A lot of new moms feel like they’re on an emotional rollercoaster—they don’t get much sleep, have little time for themselves, and are faced with a lot of new responsibilities. But if your symptoms don’t go away after a few weeks, you may have postpartum depression (PPD). This can affect if and how you bond with your baby. Getting prompt treatment of PPD can help you more effectively bond with your new baby.Recognize that the symptoms of PPD are: withdrawal from a partner or loved ones, being unable to bond, severe anxiety that prevents sleep, having feelings of guilt and worthlessness.See your doctor about diagnosing PPD and ask what your options for treatment are. They may include medications or speaking to a mental health professional.Remember to give your baby consistent care even if you don’t feel well—this keeps your baby bonded to you and may help foster your own bonding process., Most women have safe birth experience, but a small portion of women will have traumatic births. This can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, which in turn can make a woman feel isolate from her baby and loved ones.Be aware that typical symptoms of PTSD following a traumatic birth are: intrusive memories or flashbacks of the event; avoiding anything that reminds you of the birth, including your baby; sleep problems; fear of another traumatic birth; avoiding touch or sex.Make sure that you talk to your doctor, a mental health professional, and your loved ones to get help.
Join local or online communities for mothers healing from traumatic birth. Groups such as Solace for Mothers have online communities and tools to help mothers who experienced a traumatic birth. Remember that these communities are safe spaces and you can be open and honest about your experience. You may find that your fellow mothers have great tips on bonding with your baby after a traumatic birth., Just like parents with infants who are in intensive care, moms and dad with babies who have special needs can also have difficult bonding experiences. This can be a result of the parent having a grief response to the child’s disability.Forge a bond by placing the baby on your chest or stomach area while both of you relax; touching, hugging, or massaging your baby firmly without movement to prevent sensory issues; talking to your baby often and in a soft voice and consider getting him or her close to your face; and making eye contact when talking to your baby.
Find a local or online support group to discuss any problems you have bonding with your special needs baby. Groups such as Friendship Circle can help you find local and online groups. It can also help you set up a support group by meeting parents from local schools or hospitals."

Measure your baby’s feet.,
Look for shoes that are more likely to stay on.,
Consider making your own baby shoes.",How to Avoid Losing Baby Shoes1," You can do this yourself or you can take your baby to a shoe salesman for help. Your baby’s shoes will be less likely to fall off if they fit properly. Here is an easy way to measure your baby’s feet:


Stand your baby up on a piece of paper and trace their foot with a marker.
Measure the tracing from the heel to the longest toe.
Find the width of your baby’s foot by wrapping measuring ribbon around the widest part of your baby’s foot.
Use a fit guide to find your baby’s true shoe size.;
, The trick is to find a pair that stays secure around the ankle, such as elastic shoes or those with Velcro straps. When trying your baby’s shoes on, watch their response. If the shoes seem to hurt or if your baby has trouble walking, take them off and try the next pair!Shoes should be lightweight and flexible to support natural foot movement.
Shoes should be made of leather or mesh to allow your baby's feet to breathe comfortably.
Shoes should have rubber soles for traction to prevent slipping or sliding., It’s not as hard as it seems! Choose a soft fabric such as interlock knit or baby flannel for baby's comfort. You’ll also need scissors, thread, elastic, a pencil, two safety pins, and a sewing machine.Not only is it more affordable to make your own baby shoes, but you can also make sure they fit your baby perfectly.


Search Pinterest for patterns. Etsy has patterns you can purchase by shoe size for a small fee. Look for patterns that match your baby's age, aesthetics, and clothing style.

Do not bring it up.,
Excuse yourself.,
Claim to have a name if you don't already.",How to Avoid Unwanted Advice About Baby Names1," Do not bring the subject up yourself if you are looking to avoid unwanted advice. Refrain from talking about baby names with anyone who isn’t your partner unless you specifically want their opinion on the matter, even if you've already chosen a name.This can be especially helpful around close friends and family who may feel comfortable inserting themselves even when you did not request their advice.;
, When someone starts to offer you unsolicited baby name advice, excuse yourself momentarily to use the restroom or make a quick work-related call. Often, by the time you return the individual will have moved onto another person or topic.


Politely say, “Would you excuse me for just a moment? I have to make a quick call before my boss leaves for the night.”
If possible, try to start a new conversation once you return to your conversation with the individual.

, If someone asks you if you’ve already picked out a name, it may be easiest to say yes whether you have or have not. Let them know that you have a name in mind, but that you are waiting to learn the baby’s sex or until the birth to reveal it. Assert that keeping the name private is a personal choice.


Do not feel pressure to bend to other people’s demands to know the baby name. Remember that you are not obligated to tell them simply because they asked.

Install safety latches on cabinets and drawers to keep children from potentially poisonous household products.

,
Keep tweezers, toiletries, lipstick, and razors out of reach of children.

,
Install toilet locks to keep toilet lids closed.,
Install anti-scalding devices on faucets and shower heads to prevent burns.,
Pay close attention to bath and baby oils.,
Secure your bathroom.",How to Babyproof Your Home8,",, Children are more top-heavy than adults and can lean and fall into a toilet easily. They also can drown in just one inch of water.

, Also set the water heater thermostat to 120 degrees. It takes just three seconds for a child to sustain a third-degree burn from water at 140 degrees.

, Although baby oils are meant to be used in a child's bath, some of those products can be harmful. The reason is some baby and bath oils contain hydrocarbons in a liquid form. Those hydrocarbons cause a serious internal damage which can lead to death if the substance has been aspirated into the lungs. Make sure all such products are unreachable to children., Install safety taps and mark hot and cold water taps clearly. Place cleaning products out of reach or install a child-resistant cabinet or safety lock.·Lower the hot water system’s temperature to 50 degrees Celsius. Always supervise children aged under 5 years in the bath; check the water temperature is no higher than 38 degrees C and always run cold water first; run only enough water for washing and play (belly-button height) and empty the bath as soon as finished. ·

Get bath seats and rings. A baby should never be left alone in a bathtub. Even if the baby is located in a bath seat, you should still be watching it. A single suction cup on the bottom of the bath seat can suddenly release causing it to slide or tip over. Always watch over your baby during bath time and never leave bathroom, even for a moment.

If you must borrow a crib or buy one second-hand, be sure to check with the Consumer Product Safety Commission to make sure that the model was not recalled. Whether the crib is new or used, it should comply with the following guidelines:It should not have any broken or loose hardware.
The distance between the slats should be no wider than 2 3/8 inches, and there shouldn't be any broken or missing slats.
It should not have any decorative cutouts.
The mattress should fit snugly enough that you cannot fit more than two fingers between the edge of the mattress and the side of the crib.
Corner posts should not be more than 1/16 of an inch high. If the crib has a canopy, the corner posts should be at least 16 inches high.
It should have fixed sides. If you must use a drop-side crib, you can purchase special immobilizers to keep the sides from moving.;
, In addition to the cribs themselves, many commonly used bedding items can pose a suffocation risk to your baby. It's best to never put anything in the crib except the mattress and your baby. Avoid the following items:Soft bedding
Pillows
Stuffed animals
Crib bumpers

, If you are going to change your baby on a table, it is very important to make sure that he does not roll off of the table. The best way to do this is to keep a hand on him at all times while he is on the table.Choosing a changing table with a safety strap (and using it every time) will also help prevent your baby from falling.
Using a table with four raised sides will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of falls.Changing your baby on the floor will eliminate these risks, although it may not be very comfortable for you.
To avoid running into a situation where you must take your hands off your baby during changing, store all of your diaper changing necessities in a location where you (but not your baby) can reach them from the table., Babies are very curious, and they love to put everything in their mouths. To prevent your baby from choking, be vigilant about removing any item that is small enough to fit in his mouth from his room.Common chocking hazards include marbles, batteries, coins, pen caps, jewelry, crayons, hardware, and stuffing from toys or furniture.When choosing toys, make sure no small parts can become dislodged.

, Blinds and shades that have pull cords can pose a strangulation risk to babies, so it's best to remove these from your home entirely. You can still use blinds in your baby's room; simply choose a cordless style.
If your window coverings have cords, keep them out of the baby's reach by using cords stops or tying them in knots.

, If there is anything that your baby may be able to pull into his crib, it's best to remove it. This includes mobiles and anything that is hung on the wall above the crib.Similarly, make sure the bed is not near any windows or heaters., Be sure to remove any appliances or light bulbs that get hot from your baby's room. When purchasing a night light and other lighting for the room, make sure that it stays cool to the touch., If there isn't already a smoke detector in your baby's room, install one to help ensure that a fire will be detected right away. For added safety, you should have one on every floor of your home, as well as one in every bedroom.Be sure to check the batteries in the smoke detector every month and replace them at least once a year.
Many smoke detectors act as carbon monoxide detectors as well, but if yours doesn't you can buy a stand-alone battery-operated or plug-in carbon monoxide detector for your baby's room.

, If you want to keep an eye on your baby even when you aren't in the room with him, consider investing in a baby monitor. There are lots of different kinds to meet a wide variety of needs.Some baby monitors offer audio only, which helps make sure that you always hear your baby crying.
There are also many different kinds of video monitors. Some even feed the video straight to your smartphone, so you can watch your baby from anywhere in the world.

, It's important to move your baby out of his crib when he becomes able to climb out of it so he doesn't fall and injure himself. Switch him to a toddler bed with guardrails to prevent him from rolling out of bed.If your baby is 35 inches or taller, it's time to move on from the crib. Some babies are able to climb out of their cribs before they reach this height, so be sure to keep a close eye on him.

, As your baby becomes more mobile, it's very important to make sure that all of the furniture he has access to can withstand being climbed on. If any piece of furniture is at risk of toppling over, be sure to secure it to the wall using specially designed straps.You can buy straps for furniture at home improvement stores or online. They simply screw into the wall and into the top or back of your furniture.
Tall pieces of furniture like bookshelves and dressers are the most likely to topple over.
TVs are also a potential tipping hazard, so avoid placing them on top of dressers. If you must keep a TV in the bedroom, try wall-mounting it or hiding it behind closed doors., You definitely do not want your baby climbing out of his window during nap time, so it's very important to make sure they are secure. Even if you baby has never shown any interest in the windows before, he might suddenly decide to try climbing out of them.One option is to make sure all of your windows have stoppers that only allow them to be opened a small amount. These can be purchased at a hardware store if your windows don't already have them.
If you want to be able to open the windows all the way, make sure you have secure screens. Try pushing on them to make sure they don't fall out.
If you have double-hung windows, you can open the top half of the window all the way without worrying about your baby being able to reach it, so long as there is not a tall piece of furniture nearby that your baby might climb on top of., Your baby may try to stick his finger or another object into your electrical outlets, which can cause electrocution. In order to prevent this, you must properly babyproof your outlets.There are a variety of outlet guards you can purchase to prevent your baby from sticking something in the outlets. If you use these, make sure your baby will not be able to remove them, as they can pose a choking risk.
You can also install new tamper-resistant outlets. These will not allow anything to be inserted unless equal pressure is applied to both of the top prongs of the outlet at the same time, which is difficult to do unless you are inserting a plug.

, In addition to being curious about outlets, your baby may also be interested in tugging on electrical cords. To prevent him from yanking on cords and knocking small appliances over, consider hiding them under a wire guard.If possible, keep cords completely out of sight, by keeping them behind a large piece of furniture, for example.

, Toy chests can pose a risk to curious babies because the heavy lids may crush their fingers, and because they may get trapped inside. With some simple modifications, you can make your baby's toy chest much safer.If your toy chest has regular hinges, either remove them altogether or replace them soft-closing hinges.
Make sure your child will have air is he somehow gets trapped inside the toy chest. If it appears to be airtight, drill some holes in it.

, If there are any sharp corners in the room that your baby might hit his head on, you can easily cover them with a rubber bumper. This will help prevent injury if your baby does knock into the corner.Corner bumpers can be used on furniture and on structural elements of your home, such as fireplace hearths.

, If you have a curious toddler, you probably want to make sure that he can't get out of the room without your permission and that he can't lock the door. The right door knobs can help you create the safest situation for your baby.


Replace locking doorknobs with a non-locking variety. There is no reason to have a locking doorknob on a child's door, which might create an unpleasant situation if you lock yourself out accidentally (or if your toddler locks you out).
You can also purchase special door knob covers to prevent your baby from opening the door on his own., If your baby's bedroom is on the second floor, it's a good idea to use a baby gate at the top of the stairs. This will help prevent your little one from falling down the stairs and from exploring the entire house if he gets out of his room during nap time.Some gates screw into the walls and swing open, which makes it much easier for adults to get up and down the stairs.
If you can't drill into the walls, you can get a tension gate that adjusts to the size of your stairwell or doorway. These will cause no damage to the walls, but they are not as secure as hardware-mounted gates and they do not allow for adults to pass through as easily.

Make a shortlist of people whose values align with your own.,
Consider what they might offer your child that you do not.,
Check the policies of your local church.,
Select a person who can build a lasting relationship with your child.,
Decide when you would like to ask.,
Schedule a meeting with the prospective godparents.,
Ask questions to gauge their interest and suitability.,
Be clear about your expectations.,
Extend the invitation in a meaningful way.",How to Ask Someone to Be Your Child's Godparent," You want to pick a godparent who will be a good role model and mentor for your child. First and foremost, it should be someone that you trust and respect.Take time to think through what qualities you most appreciate and what your priorities are. Decide, for example, if you have preference for having a family member like a sibling be a godparent or if you’d rather have a close friend. If political or religious beliefs are of the utmost importance to you, then pick someone with similar views.
Similarly, if you would like a person who has a positive attitude or an honest character, narrow down your list accordingly. If it matters to you whether or not your prospective godparent is in a stable relationship or has achieved a degree of professional success, let that steer your choices.;
, While it’s important to have a godparent with shared values, you might also want them to bring something different to the table than what your child gets every day at home. They will appreciate the change of pace. For instance, is there someone more adventurous than you who could take your child out exploring or someone who works in an exciting field that she could introduce to your child? Does one of your choices have an exceptional sense of humor or personal passion they could share?

, If you intend to baptize your child or belong to a specific religious denomination, your church may have particular criteria when it comes to who can serve as a godparent. Because godparents represent the faith community during baptism ceremonies, some faiths may require one or both godparents to be of the same denomination or in good standing with the church first., You want godparents who will be accessible and take an active interest in your child’s life and well-being.


Prioritize people who are live near to you so that they can be a routine part in the child’s development.
Avoid asking people who already have multiple godchildren so that your child’s godparents do not feel overcommitted.
Take a person’s ability to assume responsibility for your child into account. For instance, you may want to shy away from asking an aging family member who may not be up to the task or present for all of your child’s upbringing., Most people wait until after their child is born, but some prefer to choose godparents during the pregnancy. If you're planning a baptism or other formal ceremony for your new arrival, be sure to ask your godparents at least a few months in advance so that they have plenty of time to make arrangements to be attendance.


If there are no logistical concerns, do what feels right to you. Asking someone during the pregnancy can make people feel included in your child’s life from the very start and means that they can be involved right away after the birth. If you hold off until after your child is born, it’s often less hectic and gives you more time to make the decision. You can also see how prospective godparents interact with your newborn.

, Touching base with each other will prepare prospective godparents for the role while helping you make an informed decision about who to select. Since you’re not officially asking the person to be a godparent during this meeting, keep it informal. Arrange a time when you see them in person or through a casual phone call. Choose a location that fits into your normal social interaction with the person. You also want your conversation to be as friendly and open as possible; it shouldn’t feel like job interview or interrogation.


Give your friend or family member a heads up that you’d like to discuss the possibility of them being a godparent for your child. Telling them you’d like to chat about godparenting will allow them to consider what they think about the prospect in advance.
You could say something as simple as: “We’re trying to decide who Amy’s godparents should be. We thought about you and were wondering if you’re interested. If so, would you be up for discussing it when we meet?” The other advantage of mentioning this beforehand is that if they immediately react against the idea, you can cross them off the list without further ado.

, Use your meeting to find out if the person is game, seems like the best choice for the part, and will enjoy the experience and not see it as a burden. You may start by asking them about their godparents, if they had any. Whether or not they had a solid relationship with their godparents, it’s a good way to segway into a discussion of what they think a good relationship between godparents and their godchild would look like.


Consider asking questions such as, “What does being a godparent mean to you?” or “What would you look forward to about mentoring Amy?” Their answers will give you a sense about how they would approach the role. If they have responses that are enthusiastic and resonate with your ideas about godparenting, you are on the right track.
Don’t hesitate to ask about their future plans. Some relevant questions may include: “Do you think you’ll stay in the area or are you looking to move sometime down the line?” “Is your company likely to ask you to relocate?” “Will your work schedule and family commitments allow you space to occasionally spend time with our child?”

, Being a godparent is an honor that comes with responsibility. If you want them to take the role seriously, be up front about what sort of relationship and what kinds of interactions you would like for a godparent to have with your child. Before you have your meeting, think about how and when you would like for them to be in touch with your child and whether you expect them to be present for birthdays, confirmations, graduations, and other milestones.Godparents are often the people designated to take care of their children in the event anything should happen to their parents. If you would like your prospective godparent to assume this responsibility, say so and ask them how they would feel about it.

You could ask: “If Oliver and I were to die in an accident, would you be ready and able to take care of Amy and raise her for us?” This is the weightiest of responsibilities for a godparent, so it’s important to broach the subject. If they’re not willing to step in as a guardian, you will have to find someone else., You’ve done your homework, now it’s time to make the ask for this very special request. There are plenty of thoughtful and creative ways to make new godparents feel welcomed and appreciated.Have a family dinner in their honor. Especially if they’re not a blood relative, this is a gesture that shows they’re a valued part of your family circle.
Send them a card with a sincere message. Many shops and online stores carry notecards that are specifically addressed to godparents. If you’re feeling playful, you can write the note from your child’s perspective, to let the new godparent know how much it’ll mean to your daughter or son.
Give them a framed picture of their new goddaughter or godson or include a photo in your card. To add a bit of fun, have your child hold a sign or wear a onesie that asks the question for you.
Create a personalized gift to mark the occasion. It could be a mug or a t-shirt with a message, like “Best Godparent,” or a piece of jewelry or a key chain with an inscription that they can carry with them as a reminder.

Find out the mother's lunar age at the time of conception.,
Determine the lunar month during which the baby was conceived.,
Using the graph below, find the place where your lunar age and the child's conception month intersect.",How to Use the Chinese Birth Gender Chart for Gender Selection1," The Chinese use a lunar calendar, which is different from the Western Gregorian calendar. For this reason, you're going to have to calculate the mother's age according to the lunar calendar, not the Gregorian calendar.


First of all, add one year to however old you are right now. You're 32 years old right now? According to the Chinese calendar, you're at least 33 (possibly 34). This is because the Chinese count the first nine months spent in the womb towards the baby's age, unlike in the West. So when a baby is born, it's already 1 year old according to the lunar calendar.
If you were born after February 22, take your Gregorian age, add 1 (from the roughly year you spent in your mother's womb), and you're done. If you're 17 and you were born on July 11, you're 18 according to the lunar calendar.
If you were born before February 22, find out if your birthday comes before or after the Chinese New Year during the year you were born. If you were born before the Chinese New Year, add an additional year to your Gregorian age.

For example, you were born on January 7, 1990; the Chinese New Year during 1990 happened on January 27, meaning you were born before the New Year, according to the lunar calendar. This makes you two years older, in lunar years, than you are according to the Gregorian calendar.


If you're having trouble converting your Gregorian age to your lunar age, search for an online converter or click here.;
, If the baby has not yet been conceived, determine the month that you would like the baby to be conceived, or just work backward: use the calendar and desired gender to determine when you should conceive.


The easiest way to convert the actual month or the desired month of conception to the lunar calendar is to use an online converter. Type in ""Gregorian to lunar calendar conversion,"" or use the one supplied here


, Start from your lunar age at the time of conception and move right until you find the lunar month when the child conceived. This will give you either a G (girl) or B (Boy).

Agree on how you want your baby's name to be perceived.,
Do your research.,
Create a list of potential names.,
Listen and be open to your partner's suggestions.,
Avoid rushing to pick a name.",How to Avoid Clashes Regarding Your Baby's Name," Before you or your partner begin suggesting the name options, make sure you both are clear on the kind of image you want the name to embody. Do you want a powerful name or one that’s peaceful? Are you more inclined on a classic name or an exotic name is what suits your fancy? Get answers to these questions before you begin your research.;
, Avoid limiting yourselves to the few names that you and your partner may have come across in your lives. Be open to names from different ethnicities and cultures and see if any of them catch your attention. Make sure however, that these names are not hard to spell or pronounce. With a huge online database of potential baby names at your disposal, your quest to find the right name for your baby is not as hard as you thought.

, Once you have done a research, you and your partner can make two separate lists with your individual favorites. It also helps to list down the names that you don’t want for your child in case your partner suggests the same. After preparing both the lists, sit together and select the ten best options from the two lists and chart out a final list.

, While you believe Andy is the perfect name from the final list, your partner may think Andre is the best option. Don’t be rigid with your opinion and allow your partner to put forth his reasoning. Similarly, make sure your partner gives you a chance to explain your reasons for choosing a particular name. It’s important that you both are on the same team and aim at a “win-win” rather than a “win-lose” situation.

, Since your baby’s name is going to stick with him/her for his/her entire lifetime, make sure that you and your partner don’t succumb to the pressure of time and people. It’s okay to wait it out until your baby is born. Both of you will be in a better frame of mind to decide the name once you see your baby.

Soothe sore gums when your baby is teething.,
Start brushing your baby’s teeth twice per day.,
Stop thumb sucking behaviour when adult teeth grow in.,
Teach your toddler how to spit out the toothpaste.,
Create an example of good oral care by allowing your child to watch you brush your teeth.,
Increase the amount of fluoride toothpaste used.,
Supervise your child while brushing.",How to Care for Your Baby's Teeth2," Most babies will begin teething when they’re around six months old (although it is not uncommon for age ranges to differ greatly). Normally a baby’s two bottom front teeth come in first, followed by the two top front teeth. If your baby is teething she may drool, need to chew on solid objects, become irritable, or have sore gums. There are a few things you can do to help alleviate your baby’s discomfort:Use your finger to rub your baby’s gums and apply pressure. The pressure may help ease the pain for a short time. Make sure your hands are clean first.
Cold can sometimes ease the pain of teething. You can give your baby something cool to chew or suck on to help alleviate the pain. A cool washcloth, spoon, or teething ring work best. Make sure the item is only cool, not frozen.
Try giving your baby cooled hard food to chew on while teething. A peeled and cooled cucumber or carrot work great; place the food into a mesh feeding bag designed for this purpose, or supervise your baby so the food doesn’t become a choking hazard.
Depending on how painful teething is for your baby, you might also want to try medications. Children’s strength acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help ease the pain. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure of the proper doses of medication. Ibuprofen is given only to children over six months old.

, Once all of your baby’s baby teeth have grown in, you can switch to brushing twice a day. Until your child is able to spit out the toothpaste on his own, continue to use only a rice-sized amount of toothpaste at each brushing., Sucking on a thumb, finger, pacifier, or other objects is a perfectly natural behaviour for babies. However, thumb sucking after adult teeth have grown in can cause permanent damage with how the mouth grows, how teeth align, and how the roof of the mouth forms.Pacifiers are no better than thumb sucking when it comes to long-term damage to the mouth.
It is a good idea to encourage your child to stop sucking a thumb (or pacifier) before adult teeth grow in. One way to do this is to praise your child for not sucking on her thumb. You could also give your child a comfort item such as a stuffed animal or blanket to use when she is tired or wants to suck her thumb or use a pacifier.
Thumb sucking is often a side effect of insecurity or discomfort. Therefore, one of the best ways to stop thumb sucking is to address the underlying reason for it. If your child feels insecure or uncomfortable, address that problem first, and thumb sucking should stop as your child becomes more secure and comfortable.
If you are having trouble getting your child to stop thumb sucking, you can also consult with your dentist for additional ideas and even medication that may help.

, When your child is about two years old, you should start to teach spitting. You need to encourage your child to spit out excess toothpaste instead of swallowing it.While it may seem easier to use water to help your child spit out the excess toothpaste, the sense of water in her mouth might actually increase the chances of swallowing. And rinsing a mouth with water after brushing can also rinse away the fluoride that is beneficial for teeth.

, Babies and children learn a lot by watching what their parents do. To help teach your child that brushing and flossing are good habits to get into, allow your child to watch you do these things. You can even have your child imitate you while you’re brushing and flossing., Once your child is able to spit out excess toothpaste while brushing, you can increase the amount of toothpaste used to a pea-sized amount. This normally happens when your child is about three years old., Even when your child is old enough to brush, you should continue to supervise until your child is at least six years old. The main reason for continuing supervision is to ensure your child isn’t using too much toothpaste or swallowing it."

Breastfeed until your baby is six months old.,
Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet.,
Start feeding your baby solid food at six months.,
Avoid giving your baby cow’s milk until she turns one.,
Switch from a bottle to a sippy cup when your baby is 6 months old.,
Reduce the amount of sugar your baby or child consumes.,
Beware of fruit juice.",How to Care for Your Baby's Teeth3," Breast milk is the absolute best food your baby can consume. Even when a baby starts on solid food around six months of age, he can continue to drink breast milk or breast milk substitutes. As long as you clean your baby’s teeth and gums after meals, breast milk should not have any negative impacts on your baby’s oral health., While you’re breastfeeding, anything you eat can affect your baby. Therefore you need to eat a healthy and well-balanced diet in order to ensure both you and your baby remain healthy.Calcium is vital for the development of strong and healthy bones and teeth. This means you need to ensure you consume enough calcium for both yourself and your baby while you’re breastfeeding.

, Your baby should start eating solid food at around six months of age. Ideally, this solid food should be fortified with iron and contain no added sugar.Serving cereal with milk will help reduce the effect the sugar will have on your baby’s teeth.
You should not allow your baby to consume sweetened cereal as a snack between meals. The exposure of your baby’s teeth to sugar over a long period of time is worse than if the sugary item is consumed all at once.

, In order to avoid iron-deficiency anemia, your baby should not be given cow’s milk until at least one years of age. If you want to put milk on your baby’s cereal, use breast milk or infant milk, not cow’s milk. When your baby is between one and two years old, you can start providing cow’s milk as a drink, but only up to a maximum of 24 ounces per day., In order to ensure bottle mouth doesn’t happen to your baby, it is a good idea to start switching to a sippy cup around six months of age. The sucking motion of drinking from a bottle can actually damage your baby’s mouth, so switching to a safer form of cup is a good idea., Sugar can cause teeth to decay — in adults and children. If your child has sweets every day, it will significantly increase the risk of tooth decay. Reduce the amount of sweets your baby or child consumes, including sugary drinks, to help prevent any form of dental intervention.Tooth decay and damage can also be caused by drinks that are highly acidic, like juice.
Give your baby mainly milk and water to drink, instead of pop or juice.
Check the amount of sugar contained in baby food and try to select the options with the least amount of sugar.
Dilute juice with water by adding 10 times the amount of water to a bit of juice.
Reward your baby with objects like stickers, etc., rather than cookies or sweet treats.
If your baby requires medication, ask your doctor for a sugar-free version.

, Fruit juice contains a lot of sugar; because of this infants should consume no more than 4 – 6 ounces of juice per day — at most. If an infant is given fruit juice to drink, all the juice should be consumed at once. Fruit juice should only be given as a drink during the day, not before bedtime.Infants should eat mashed or pureed fruit prepared at home. Unfortunately a lot of mashed or pureed fruit baby food includes added sugar. If you are unable to make your own, look for a commercial version with low or no sugar.
If you give an infant juice to drink, it needs to be consumed all at once, over a short period of time. The longer teeth are exposed to sugar, the harsher the impact will be to the teeth.
The same suggestions for fruit juice also apply to soda pop and any other beverages with sugar added (e.g. Kool-Aid).

Write your identification inside each shoe.,
Remind yourself to check for missing shoes.,
Wear them for special events only.,
Skip the shoes and opt for socks instead.",How to Avoid Losing Baby Shoes2," Use a thin permanent marker to write your last name and phone number inside each shoe. If your baby goes to daycare, you may want to consider inserting daily shoe label stickers into their shoes. Use white sticky labels for daily use.

, Get in the habit of searching your baby’s feet for missing shoes. If you plan on being out in public for a long time, set a reminder on your phone to go off every 15 minutes to check and see that their shoes are still on secure.


If a shoe has gone missing, start mentally retracing your steps to figure out where you could have left it. Contact the lost and found of the location to see if the baby’s shoe was turned in by a helpful stranger.

, While they are cute and complete your baby’s outfit, babies don’t need shoes, and toddlers only need shoes when walking in public.Consider having your baby wear shoes for special events only. If your baby isn't wearing them as often, they will be less likely to lose them.

, After they start walking, you want your baby to be either barefoot or in the most flexible shoe possible so that their muscles develop properly and they learn how to walk and balance better. Keep feet warm, clean, and protected by using socks with rubber grips. This will also help them not to slip."

Limit who you tell.,
Set conversation rules.,
Take time for yourself.",How to Avoid Unwanted Advice About Baby Names2," You will be excited to tell some people such as close friends and immediate family about your pregnancy. Coworkers or others that you see regularly will likely figure it out as well when you start to show. However, limiting the number of people you tell about your baby news early on will help keep the number of unsolicited advisors down.


Avoid posting the news to social media until later in pregnancy, when you’re looking at events like a baby shower. This will help keep away unwanted opinions from distant relatives and friendly acquaintances who know you best through your social media profiles.

, When you are pregnant, much of your life becomes about getting ready for your baby. When meeting with friends or family, set a conversational boundary and request no baby-related talk during your visit.Let them know that you’ve been focused largely on the baby, and would really benefit from a conversation where you get to focus on other things going on in the world.

, If you have an event or an obligation involving a person you think will provide you with a lot of unsolicited advice or opinions, do not be afraid to take time for yourself. Let the individual know that you need that time to rest and look after the health of you and your baby.Let the person know, “I really need a little time to rest and make sure the baby is doing well. I would be happy to meet up another time.”

Say “thank you.” Often, taking the high road is the easiest way to shut down the conversation and still keep people on your good side.,
Consider the source.,
Ask for other advice.",How to Avoid Unwanted Advice About Baby Names3," When someone offers you baby name advice or opinions that you don’t want, simply thank them and then progress the conversation onto a new subject.For example, if someone suggests a name, simply say to then, “I’ll keep that one in mind, thank you. So, how was your day at work?” If someone offers input on a name you've already chosen, let them know, ""I'll consider your advice. Now, how was your day?""
Try to shift the conversation toward the other person to avoid any further unsolicited baby advice.

, Perhaps there is a name that is significant in your family. Or perhaps there are certain social or cultural connotations that accompany certain names in your area. Consider who is offering the advice and why, and be willing to listen, even if you already have a name you like.Know that listening does not mean you need to apply the advice. However, listening politely may make others feel like they were heard this time and keep them from pressuring you in the future.
Understand that this advice may come out of love or from genuine concern. Know that it is likely not meant to hurt, shame, or otherwise insult you.

, If someone is looking to advise you or give you an opinion, shift the subject from baby names to something you actually want advice or an opinion on. For example, you may want to ask them if they know of any good pediatricians in the area or affordable but safe car seats.


When you are talking with the person, try turning the subject by saying, “I’m still considering baby names right now, but do you know of a good daycare program for young children?”

Use the birth chart to try to select which gender you ideally want.,
Remember that accurate readings always involve the Chinese lunar calendar and dates based on the time of conception.,
Know that there is no scientific basis to the Chinese birth chart.",How to Use the Chinese Birth Gender Chart for Gender Selection2," While many families use the Chinese birth chart after a child has been conceived, some couples look to the birth calendar before conception to select a boy or girl specifically. Whatever gender your child is, you're sure to love them; but what if you could figure it all out beforehand?

,


Birth charts that don't use the lunar calendar as a guide aren't accurate. Beware of readings that use the Gregorian Calendar.
Be sure to select dates based on the date of conception, especially when considering age. Select how old you were at the time of conception, not how old you currently are.

, Science has been unable to verify the accuracy of the Chinese birth chart, so be careful using the chart solely to determine or predict the gender of your child. There are several ways to scientifically predict the gender of your unborn baby — ultrasound, amniocentesis— but the Chinese birth chart is not one of them.

Before visiting anyone with a new baby, prepare yourself for the worst.,
Preview photos from Facebook or the baby announcement before meeting the child.,
Time your visit thoughtfully.,
Think of three positive qualities you could say about the infant.,
Think of indirect compliments that can be said with a genuine underpinning.,
Focus on the parents.,
Keep comments about the baby short and sweet.,
Keep quiet after your compliment or simple praise comments.",How to React to an Ugly Baby," What one mom finds adorable, you may find distasteful or even horrifying. If you brace yourself for the possibility the baby could be on the ugly side, you may not have an extreme reaction, revealing your true feelings and hurting mom’s. If you're someone who really isn't into babies and all that comes with breeding, you'll need to dig even deeper in your bag of compassionate reactions. Suspend your usual cynicism or fears about babies and put on a brave face. In particular, pull out your manners above all because this is about to be a case of being polite.;
, Luckily for you, if the parents love sharing their baby photos online, this is one excellent and very private way to prepare yourself for the initial meeting. Prior peeking at the photos of the newborn will let you know what the baby looks like before you meet him or her. That way, you're better prepared when the parents want you to meet the baby. In fact, there may even be some improvements in the time between seeing the online images and the baby in the flesh.

, Delay is a good thing. Let the new parents know that you don't wish to crowd them out and want them to have their personal bonding time. Let them know you'll come by in about a week to see the new addition to their family. This gives some time for the baby's features to straighten out a bit. It also gives mom and dad more time to be used to handling their new baby, which gives you lots of excuses to ask about the caring process rather than the birth itself (details of which can be really gruesome to have to listen to and risk coloring your impressions of the baby negatively).

, If push comes to shove and you need material fast, have three comments on hand that can be rolled off the tongue before you consider the praising part closed. However, choose your words wisely. In the classic, “ugly baby” Seinfeld episode, the parent’s visiting-single-doctor-friend refers to his friends' baby as “breathtaking”--much to the befuddlement of Elaine...and then, much to the absolute horror of Elaine, in another scene, refers to Elaine as “breathtaking” too! In a feeble attempt to avoid saying that the baby is unattractive, Jerry Seinfeld and his motley crew end up saying that the baby is ""snuggly"", which has become a pop culture code word for “ugly.” Instead of making a similar faux pas, think in advance of what you'll say. Choose words like, ""sweet"", ""cuddly"", ""lovable"" or ""soft"" when referring to a baby.

, Direct compliments may stick in your throat but there are plenty of polite and considerate ways around this. Here are just some of them:


Talk about how much hair he or she has (or lack thereof) or the size of his or her feet and hands.
Suggest that you're positive the baby is trying to smile already and that it's clear he or she has a ""very happy demeanor""––no parent is going to be put off by having a happy baby!
Single out the one feature that is nice to behold. It might be the eyes, or the tiny fingers or the way the baby's toes curl up. This works whether you're totally clueless about babies or well-versed in having your own because it shows that you're noticing something about the baby that matters to you.
Another great way around focusing on the ugly stick is to comment on the baby's health. Simply say with great heartiness: ""Wow, you've one healthy looking baby there!"", or something along similar lines. Again, it'd be an odd parent who didn't glow at the thought of having a healthy bub.
Go all ga ga and just make baby noises. Say something like ""Aw, goo, who's a liddle baby den, coochy coochy coo, look at you!"" Total nonsense baby talk can maneuver you right around the issue of ugliness. And it can alleviate your guilt knowing you look like a complete idiot doing baby talk, thereby deflecting the awkward moment of lack of praise into a moment of self-deprecating behavior.

, One of the best ways to avoid having to make comments about the baby is to ask about the parents, especially mom. Maintain eye contact with the parents and ask how mom is feeling, how having a baby has changed their lives and what they like most about being new parents. Often parents are so used to visitors talking about the baby, a discussion about how they are feeling may be welcomed and a good diversion from having to comment on the child. Avoid asking questions such as requesting a detailed description of the delivery or general comments or questions about breastfeeding. Stick to light, run-of-the-mill questions like how much sleep mom and dad are getting and the overall impact of being a new parent has on their life.

, Stick to your main comments you rehearsed before the meeting and then focus on other topics. If you start to talk excessively about the baby you could paint yourself into a corner and end up saying something you didn’t want to say in the first place. If mom keeps taking the conversation back to the baby, buckle in and let her do all the talking. Nod, smile and agree. Provide general responses to questions such as, “Do you think she is the most adorable baby in the world?” Your response could be, “Yes, she is a wonderful child.”

, Nothing more needs to be said about the matter. You can always offer to hold the baby if it's appropriate and through your awed silence, appear to be taken in by the specialness of the moment.

There is never a requirement to gush. If you find yourself falling into that trap, immediately stop yourself. Gushing is pointless and soon tips into the realm of insincerity.

Learn as much about your baby’s medical condition as possible.,
Strive to set up a good relationship with the staff that will be attending to your baby while he is in the NICU.",How to Bond With Your Premature Baby in the NICU1," Some premature babies will just need more time for their lungs to mature, while others may suffer from more serious complications. The more that you know and understand about what your baby needs, the better you will be able to ensure he is receiving the treatment and care that is best for him.


Speak with neonatal nurses and technicians every time they make their rounds. Inquire about improvements or setbacks in your baby’s conditions. If you do not understand something, don’t be afraid to ask.
Find out when the NICU head doctor will be stopping by. Generally, head doctors stop by once or twice each day to check in on their patients. Sometimes, if you have a specific question about your baby’s condition or his treatments, the nursing staff may not have the answer for you. If you know when the head doctor will be making his rounds, you can make sure you are there during those times and you can ask to speak with him directly.;
, Depending on how premature you baby was, he can be in the NICU anywhere form a few days to several months. The NICU staff will be your baby’s full-time caregivers until he is released. Take the time to familiarize yourself with each staff member that will be caring for your baby. If you are comfortable with his caregivers, you will be more at ease knowing that he is in good hands during those times when you cannot be there.

Arrange for a sitter to care for younger children if there are any.,
Utilize the cots or recliners that some NICU’s offer to parents.,
Inquire about any special housing charities that may be located nearby and use them if available.",How to Bond With Your Premature Baby in the NICU2," Young siblings are often not allowed in the NICU. Call on family and friends whenever possible.


If finances allow, you may want to consider hiring a part time nanny or babysitter to help care for siblings during this time.
If money is tight, consider hiring high school students to care for your children. They often will charge a lower hourly rate than a professional caregiver, especially if they are looking to gain babysitting experience.

, Being able to room in with your baby can help with the bonding process. Oftentimes, parents of NICU babies feel deprived of simple parenting tasks that other parents take for granted, such as nighttime feedings and middle of the night diaper changes. Even if you only get to room in one or two nights per week, it can significantly boost your spirits.

, If you do not live close to the hospital, it may be difficult to visit with your baby as much as you’d like. The long drive home, knowing that they are leaving their baby behind, can be devastating for parents. The NICU staff will be able to provide details about local housing opportunities.

Nothing is going to make you forget that your baby is hooked up to machines in a tiny incubator instead of at home in his crib. However, by learning how to relax, you can see past those machines and really look at the joy of your tiny baby.

,


If you are able to hold your baby, tune out all of the beeping monitors and really focus on holding your little one. Take advantage of this time to bond with him. Feel his skin, touch his hair, wiggle his toes...all of these moments can strengthen the parent-child bond.
If you cannot hold your baby, sit near his isolette and direct your focus to him and only him. Tune out all the noises around you and pay attention to every move or noise he makes.

, When you are with your baby, do not get distracted by anything else. Turn off your cellphone and leave the world outside of the NICU behind you. When bonding with your baby, do not focus on his medical condition or worry about how he is doing. Save that for later when you speak with the doctors. Instead, focus completely on enjoying the precious moments that you get to spend with your baby.

, Chances are that your NICU baby will be sleeping most of the time. When he is awake, be sure to make eye contact with him. This can help with the bonding process and make your baby feel more comfortable. This is especially important for babies who cannot yet be held by their parents.

Find more babies.",How to Make Your Baby Cuter," Baby hair has a “mind” of its own. Sometimes insisting on sticking straight up or giving the appearance that the child has put his or her finger in a light socket, wild and crazy baby hair can be both charming but also somewhat disconcerting.

Find a good baby shampoo that will tame fly-aways. Tame that wild hair with some extra special baby shampoo void of toxins and unnatural compounds. Some gentle but effective shampoos in North America include Mrs. Meyers, Johnson’s and Aubrey Organics. For other areas, ask your local pharmacist or health food store for recommendations.
Consider an adorable Mohawk if your baby’s hair naturally flares upward or add small bows for girls. Can’t seem to tame the “wild hair beast?” Go with the flow and let the hair chips fall where they may. Use a soft stretch hair tie to gather wispy baby hairs into an adorable ponytail or pigtails or let your lad look rad with a Mohawk. Don’t add gel or anything unnatural to his hair––simply wash and sculpt, since it most likely sticks up already.
If you aren’t enjoying the bald look, try cute hats or stretchy headbands. Bald babies are cute without the hair, however if you want something for his or her head, consider adorable baby bonnets, a baby baseball cap (with your favorite team) or a stretchy headband.
Gently remove cradle cap with a dab of baby oil. If your baby has cradle cap, remove the flakes using a dab of baby oil on a cotton ball. Gently brush the cotton across the cradle cap until it loosens the flakes. Wash baby’s hair to remove the oil.;
, Baby-soft skin is sweet and tender, so you’ll need to take care when addressing baby acne or other small blemishes. And if there is nothing wrong with your baby's skin, let it speak for itself without adding anything much to it.

Tend to baby acne. Never pick or scrub baby acne has it will clear up on its own in a few weeks. The only way to address baby acne is to wash it with mild baby soap, rinse and pat dry.
Apply sweet smelling baby lotion to keep baby’s skin supple and soft. Even though baby powder smelling lotion won’t help your baby to look cuter, it will certainly address the olfactory senses.

Bathe the baby on a regular basis. Choose a moisturizing baby wash when bathing baby. Make bath time fun time and gently wash between adorable baby fat folds to ensure your child is clean. And stay with your baby at all times; a baby in a bath needs constant attention to avoid mishaps.

, One of the easiest ways to increase the cute factor is to select outfits that will bring out your baby’s sweet little face and mannerisms. The sky is the limit with baby outfits but do keep your budget in mind and be sure to check out the upcycled or recycled baby clothing options in your neighborhood––after all, they grow very fast at this time of life. Things to look out for include:

Adorable accessories. From fun little hats to special bibs, you can dress your baby to the nines with complementary accessories. Bibs with cute sayings on them like ""Grandma's Joy"" or ""Tax Deduction"" are a definite must. And bonnets have ever been the mainstay of baby cuteness for centuries––knit or crochet your own, perhaps with large flowers for a girl or with animals' ears for a boy.
Cute baby shoes. Add a crowning piece to your child’s outfit with a cute pair of kicks. Many designers like Converse and Nike make shoes for children as early as birth and offer an endless selection of styles and colors. Try not to spend too much on shoes though––until the baby can walk properly, they're only for looks.
Sweet pajamas and robes. Cute outfits don’t have to stop during the day––make bedtime a charming endeavor and pick up adorable footie pajamas or a sweet, flowing nightgown for your baby girl.

, A cute baby is often a happy baby. While most parents do what they can to keep their baby happy, sometimes the baby isn’t feeling his or her best. By sticking to a schedule and addressing your baby's nutritional and emotional needs, he or she will be happier and smile a little more often.

Attend to your baby's dietary needs. Some babies have specific dietary needs and may be allergic to certain formula or baby food (if you're not breastfeeding). Even breast-fed babies may get a little cranky if mom recent ate something spicy or not within her usual dietary menu.
Make sure that your baby is getting enough sleep. Your baby is growing by leaps and bounds so sleep is a priority in his/her life. Be sure your child is getting naps and a restful sleep at night so that he or she is fresh and happy to face the day.
Play and interact with your baby. Introduce your baby to new people on an going basis so he or she gets used to seeing new faces and reacting to new people.

, Although you certainly don’t want your child to be a one-baby sideshow, teaching your child new skills that may help with motor development can end up being extremely adorable. Some fun things the two of you can learn together include:

Clapping hands. One of the early motor skills you can teach a baby is to clap his or her hands. An easy way to teach your child to clap is to play “patty cake” and guide his or her hands together until it is possible for your child to do it alone.
Saying a few words, but in baby talk. As toddlerhood approaches, your child may learn a few basic words, which typically may come out sounding incredibly cute. Words like “bye bye” or “thank you” are some of the sweetest sounds when uttered by a baby. Encourage the talking by responding with your own talk (baby talk back is not necessary, not even recommended; babies learn from real words).
React to a gesture or sound. From looking surprised in reaction to a loud noise to giggling uncontrollably to a funny face, find the trigger that makes your child squeal with delight for the ultimate in cuteness. Often a funny noisy toy or one that lights up will cause laughter from a baby.

, Finally, but most importantly, take enough photos to remember what will pass all too soon. Your baby is a miracle, a wonder and a permanent treasure in your life. And one day, when your little miracle is refusing to do his or her homework or won't come home until well after curfew, pulling out an album filled with cute baby shots will reassure you that you're doing the right thing and that your child is still the most wonderful person in your world.

In our digital age, you're free to take as many photos as you'd like. Indulge freely and sort out the best when it's convenient.




 Props can make baby seem cuter

Use props. The cuteness factor can be increased through the addition of such items as fairy wings, stuffed animals, laundry baskets, blankets, toys, pets, etc. Whatever you choose, just make sure it's both safe and comfortable for your baby to be on/in/next to/touching, etc.
Photoshop your little work of art. Even more cuteness can be achieved by cropping, changing backgrounds, removing red eye, etc. It's a good idea to do this close to the time you take the photos, when you have the greatest motivation.
Arrange in an album (or several). This is the best way to show off your cute baby. And uploading to a digital photo frame is an excellent way to let guests and friends see an array of cute baby shots every time they visit. You could also consider sharing photos online but that's up to your personal preferences.

, What is cuter than one baby? It's a bunch of babies. Whether for photos or for a get-together with other moms, placing your baby amid other babies will increase the cute factor by however many babies are there. This isn't a competition––it's an awesome baby parade!"

Inspect the necklace frequently to ensure that it is in good condition.,
Clean the necklace with mild soap, warm water and an old toothbrush.",How to Buy an Amber Teething Necklace," Pediatricians warn of the risk of choking if the beads are put in the baby's mouth and inhaled, which could happen if the necklace breaks and the beads scatter.As a safety precaution, there should be a hand tied knot between every bead, as well as the fastener.
This structure ensures that if the necklace is strongly yanked or pulled, only one bead will come loose, rather than all of the beads.Supervise your child when they are wearing the necklace so that you can act quickly and ensure no beads are swallowed if the necklace does break.;
, Teething necklaces, indeed any jewelry placed around an infant's neck, pose a significant risk of choking and strangulation.However, there are specific designs that will ensure the necklace breaks under stress if it becomes entangled, reducing this risk.


Look for necklaces that are secured with either a magnetic closure or a screw clasp. Both types of fastenings have pros and cons.
The magnetic closure is designed to break apart easily if the necklace gets caught on anything.
The screw clasp keeps the necklace secure around the child's neck and is difficult for a child to unhook, which keeps the child from taking the necklace off on their own. Some argue this offers greater security than a magnetic clasp., It should be short enough so that the child cannot put it in their mouth and chew, but still comfortable around their neck.


Look for necklaces between 12 and 15 inches (30-38 cm) long. This should fit 95% of teething infants between 4 months and 3 years.If the necklace is for an older child, measure the child's neck before purchasing a necklace.

, An amber teething necklace should be designed with double or triple-strung cotton threads for maximum strength and durability. Although strong, the string will eventually break if placed under stress, which reduces the risk of choking., Unfortunately there are lots of counterfeit amber products in circulation. It is important to ensure that any necklace you purchase is genuine Baltic amber from the Baltic region and not imitation amber.


Authentic Baltic amber dates from 44 million years ago and has 200 times the amount of succinic acid (the therapeutic ingredient) than other types of amber.Countries in the Baltic region that produce amber include Sweden, Russia, Poland, Lithuania, Germany, Finland, Latvia, Estonia and Denmark., Copal is an immature resin (typically less than 250 years old) often passed off as amber. Unlike amber, copal is not a fossilized and hardened resin.Do not purchase amber teething necklaces that advertise amber from Columbia, Madagascar or Kenya. These geographic areas have rich Copal mines, but do not produce true amber.You can test if your product is copal or amber by rubbing with a solvent such as acetone or alcohol. Copal will soften and get sticky when the solvent is applied whereas true amber will remain hard and the solvent will simply evaporate off.If you do perform this test, be sure to wash the necklace carefully with detergent and hot water before putting the necklace on your child!

, Look for online and retail vendors who specialize in Baltic amber teething necklaces. Ask about the retailer's return policy in the event the amber teething necklace is not authentic or is not effective for your child.

, The price of genuine Baltic amber products begin around $15 and can be as much as $50 for one teething necklace. If a necklace is for sale at a discount, question the vendor about its authenticity.

, Natural Baltic amber comes in a variety of colors and tones. Because amber is a natural material, expect some color inconsistency between beads. Common Baltic amber colors are honey, butterscotch, cognac, dark cherry and olive.

, A teething necklace is not designed for babies to chew on, but to be worn against the skin.


The idea is that heat from the child's body warms the amber causing it to release an oil containing succinic acid.
Succinic acid is the therapeutic ingredient that soothes the teething infant.For best results, fasten the necklace around your child's neck and tuck it inside her shirt. Tucking the necklace into clothing also keeps your child from pulling on it., The longer the amber necklace is worn the greater the effect, however, because of the risk of strangulation, you should remove the necklace when you are not around to supervise your child or if the child is sleeping.You can also wrap the necklace around your child's ankle and cover with a sock while they sleep at night to maintain the effect.If you are worried about putting a necklace around your child's neck, amber teething bracelets and anklets are also available. However, because the extremities give off less heat and the surface area of the amber is less, the effect may be slightly reduced., Look for any missing beads or broken stones.Amber is an incredibly hard resin, so damage shouldn't happen often with a high quality product.
As a safety precaution, do not put a damaged necklace on your child.

, After several weeks or months of use, the necklace may become grimy and require cleaning.


Fill a bowl with warm water and add a small amount of soap.
Dip your necklace in the bowl and gently, using a downward and back and forth motion, start brushing your necklace.
Don't scrub too hard to avoid damaging the string.
Allow to air dry or dry off with towel.
If the stones look dull after this process, rub a small amount of olive oil on the stones to recover the sheen."

Hold the baby over your shoulder.,
Pat them between the shoulder blades.,
Know when the baby burped, and stop patting.,
Put them in front of you as soon as they burp, and show them your smiling face.",How to Burp Babies1," Be sure to support your child's head and neck while you do this. You might have more success lifting your baby higher, so that his or her belly is resting on your shoulder.


You might want to put a burping cloth over your shoulder, especially if the child is under a year old. The bottom of their esophagus (the tube that brings food into the stomach) is not all the way developed and may be briefly sent out of whack when the baby burps. This sometimes causes them to spit up, but is perfectly natural.;
, Do this very gently. You should only pat them using wrist action; do not move your arm in order to burp your baby.


If you don't want to pat your baby, you can also rub his or her back using a circular motion with your hand. Although a bit less effective, it often accomplishes the same thing.

, It might sound like a normal burp, and if it does, you know to stop. Otherwise, it could sound like a sneeze, a grunt, or just a brief, ""Ump.""

, Establish your presence again and give your baby a kiss.

Begin checking for baby teeth at birth.,
Continue to check for tooth eruptions on a regular basis.",How to Brush Baby Teeth1," Though rare, some babies have come into the world with teeth already present. Check for the presence of teeth by gently sticking a clean finger into the baby’s mouth and feeling around the gums. Feel for tiny ridges or a mild inflammation along the gum line.;
, The speed at which a tooth erupts varies, and while some babies teethe for weeks before the tooth breaks through the gums, other babies can go from no teeth to 2 teeth in a weekend. Checking the gums at least once a week will ensure that you find any new teeth shortly after they come through, allowing you to begin brushing them immediately.

It doesn’t have to be the most up-to-date model, but it should have sufficient storage to download the Skype application. Delete other apps to make room, if necessary., Now that the old phone has Skype up and running, go through and make sure that you have active Skype accounts on any phones that you plan to use to monitor your baby, usually your primary cell phone., Use a stand or a shelf to position the phone so that it captures the entirety of your baby’s room or just the crib area, essentially whatever it is you would like to view. Make sure that you get the distance right so that you can see you baby’s movements, but also small details as well.It may help to pull up Skype as you are positioning the room phone.

You can then leave the computer attached to the webcam in the room or use a wireless webcam that you can establish video connections with independently.Using your webcam with a dedicated router makes it possible for you to remove the device and take it on any trips that you go on with your baby in tow.

, This is small camera set-up that frees you from having to use a computer. Once the device is activated and installed in your baby’s room, you can pull up Skype or another monitoring program whenever you like to activate the video and audio.IP cameras work by establishing their own separate IP address, creating a network connection without the necessary wires.

, Skype also sells their own video device that you can use for baby monitoring. Going through Skype for the purchase can eliminate many of the problems that you might face with installation.

, Skype is not your only option for video monitoring. If you plan to use your smartphone, look into your other options, including the cloud baby monitor or the dormi. These apps offer features that allow you to hear sounds without disturbing your baby. They also come with motion alerts and the capability to connect multiple devices.Some security companies are also getting into the baby monitoring game and many of their devices are compatible with Skype.

Rest your baby on your thigh in a sitting position.,
Pat, rub, or lightly bounce your baby until he or she burps.,
Finish feeding your baby after they burp.",How to Burp Babies2," As you do this, be sure to support your baby's head and neck.If you so choose, place a burp cloth over your and your baby's thighs to catch any spit.


Support your baby's front chest with your hands and their neck and head with your fingers. This will make sure that your baby is in a secure position and their upper extremities are supported at all times.

, There are several ways you can try to elicit a burp from your baby, although it might take several minutes until they need to. They include:


Patting. Pat very lightly, using mostly wrist action, not the full force of your arm.
Rubbing. Rub using circular motions.
Bouncing. Lightly bounce your baby making sure that his or her neck is fully supported.

, Your baby may struggle to burp once, or may burp several times in the course of a feeding. It all depends on their individual constitutions.

, Again, this may take several minutes; it may be instantaneous. It all depends on the child. Not every feeding needs to elicit a burp, but if your baby is writhing or uncomfortable, they may need it in order to continue feeding., Your baby may struggle to burp once, or may burp several times in the course of a feeding. It all depends on their individual constitutions.

"
"
Try to breastfeed, not bottle-feed.,
Feed the baby in a (more or less) upright position.,
Aim for frequent, lighter feedings.,
Get feedback from your baby about whether they need to burp.,
Know that not every feeding is accompanied by burping.",How to Burp Babies4," Breastfeeding is an easier way to avoid the need to burp, as the flow of milk is much more restricted. Bottle-feeding often forces the babies to gulp air along with the milk.

, Hold your baby at a 45° angle when breast- or bottle-feeding. This lowers the chance that the baby will need to burp by positioning the baby in an easier position to swallow.

, Long, heavy feedings present a higher chance of letting the baby gulp in excess air. Try to keep the feedings light and frequent instead.

, In between suckling, look at your baby and try to gauge their comfort level. An uncomfortable grimace on your baby's otherwise pleasant lips may mean that she needs to burp. If the baby relaxes her face again and seems content, the urge to burp has probably passed.

, Some babies burp more than others, and even then, there will come times when your otherwise burp-happy baby won't need to burp. As your baby grows older, their ability to self-regulate will improve and their need to burp will fade.

Look for a very soft bristle brush with 3 or less rows of bristles. By the age of 1 year baby should be brushing with a toothbrush.

, You are trying to get baby accustomed to the brushing technique. Incorporating toothpaste at this stage can make baby more resistant to the attempts. Use only warm water.

, Be sure to supervise.


Start by encouraging baby to hold on to the toothbrush handle while you brush his teeth.
After he is comfortable with that, you can begin letting him brush his own teeth. You will want to go back and do the brushing again after he is finished.

, Gradually work your way up to more frequent brushings until he allows you to brush his teeth after each meal.

, Follow with a gentle up and down motion to both the inside and the outside of the teeth. Be sure to include the tongue in the brushing process.

Incorporate a tiny drop of children’s toothpaste into the routine as baby matures.,
Speak to your health care provider about toothpastes with fluoride in them.,
Make baby drink water after brushing his teeth if he is unable to sip and spit.",How to Brush Baby Teeth5," This is safe for baby’s who will have more difficulty with the spit rather than swallow action that is required with toothpaste. This can be used until the age of 3 years.

, A drop no larger than a pea is all that is required.

, If you decide to use toothpaste with fluoride, be sure to decrease the amount used from a pea size drop to a grain of rice size drop to avoid giving too much fluoride to baby.

, This will assist with diluting any paste that has been swallowed, which is particularly important if using a paste that contains fluoride.

Purchase a favorite character toothbrush to encourage brushing.

,
Turn toothbrush time into a happy time by incorporating silly songs or games into the time spent brushing.,
Brush your teeth at the same time that your baby brushes his.,
Follow up the brushing with a glass of water.,
Teach your baby about the oral care that is needed to keep his toothbrush clean.,
Reward your baby for his efforts.",How to Brush Baby Teeth6," Keep the time spent brushing to a minimum so he does not become frustrated or lose interest.

,, Count each tooth as he brushes it. Allow him to look in the mirror while he is brushing his teeth.

, Speak to him about what you are doing to get him engaged. Encourage him to follow your lead and do what you do.

, Continue to work on the rinse and spit technique until he masters it. It can take some time before he perfects this step. Watching you do this can be helpful in the learning process.

, Most children love to play in water, so getting him to rinse the brush after brushing should not be too much of a challenge.

, Anything that will make your child feel rewarded will work. Offer a special reward after each brushing, such as reading a favorite book, playing with a favorite toy or engaging in a favorite activity. Be creative and find what will work best for your baby.

Bathe or sponge your child with lukewarm water.,
Change your baby's clothing.,
Remove any clothing once it becomes soaked with sweat.,
Cover your infant with a lightweight blanket if he or she gets cold.,
Decrease your baby’s level of activity.,
Give your infant extra fluids.",How to Break a Fever in an Infant2," Never use cold water, ice baths, or rubbing alcohol. A fever must be brought down gradually, and these methods will reduce body temperature too rapidly and may cause additional health problems. Moreover, rubbing alcohol comes with the additional risk of alcohol poisoning, which may occur if the alcohol is absorbed through the skin. , Make sure your baby is dressed in lightweight fabrics, and keep layers to a minimum. Extra layers will likely trap the excess body heat produced by your baby's fever, causing your baby to stay too warm and encouraging the fever to continue rising. If your baby starts to shiver, however, you may need to add an extra layer to prevent him or her from catching a chill.

, A little dampness may not cause much damage, but a thoroughly drenched garment may cause your baby to catch a chill, which will only complicate your child's illness.

, Shivering is a tell-tale sign that your child needs additional coverage to stay warm. Blankets make a good choice because they are easier to remove and adjust than clothing. Never use heavy-weight blankets, however, since these will only cause your infant's body temperature to increase.

, It is a good sign if your child is still interested in playing, but too much physical activity will only cause the body’s internal temperature to continue climbing. Keep your baby indoors and relatively sedate.

, Preventing dehydration is an important part of fighting a fever. Infants under six months of age should only receive breast milk or formula, but you may consider supplementing this with small amounts of water, natural fruit juice, or gelatin and popsicles made with natural fruit juice to babies over six months."

Be aware that removing a diaper too quickly from a baby boy may cause him to urinate.Place a new diaper under your baby and apply an ointment made for the diaper area before fastening up the diaper. Your doctor can give you suggestions about ointments to use. These ointments often feature zinc oxide as the main ingredient. Applying an ointment can help to prevent diaper rash.Wash your hands after changing the diaper., Give your baby a bath a couple of times a week or if she has a diaper blowout that wipes cannot clean.This can ensure that her skin stays clean without drying out.Allow your baby’s stomach to calm for a bit if you want to bathe her after a feeding.Have a washcloth, towel with a hood, mild, unscented baby shampoo and soap, baby wipes, a clean diaper, and clean clothes ready before her bath.This can help you focus solely on the baby and not gathering items once you’ve started.Consider a sponge bath if you don’t want to use a tub every time.Fill the tub with 2-3 inches (5-8 centimeters) of warm water. Pour the warm water on your baby throughout the bath to keep her warm.The water should be around 100F (38 degrees Celsius) and lower than 120F (49C) to prevent scalding.Support your baby, including her head, throughout the bath so that she doesn’t slip and hurt herself.Focus on washing inside skin folds, especially on the face, neck, and diaper area.Wrap your baby in a towel with a hood when you’re finished to keep her warm and cozy.Massage baby with hypoallergenic lotion if you like.This can calm her and give you a nice bonding experience., Babies need short nails to minimize the risk of scratching or cutting their delicate skin.Because babies’ nails grow quickly, trim or file your baby’s nails once or twice a week, or more often if necessary.Use baby nail scissors or a small emery board. These are gentler and safer to use on a fidgety or squirming baby.Consider asking your partner, a friend, or a family member to help you trim your baby’s nails. This may minimize the risk of cutting her.Apply pressure to your baby’s finger if you accidentally cut it and draw blood. This is normal and you shouldn’t worry. Don’t use a bandage, which a baby may choke on if it gets into her mouth., The umbilical cord is essential while your baby is in the womb, but after birth it is not necessary. Your baby's doctor will clamp what is left of the cord and it will fall off on its own in about two weeks.You should keep the umbilical cord area clean and dry until it falls off, but you do not need to clean it unless it looks crusty or sticky. If you notice a crusty or sticky discharge around the umbilical cord stump, then clean it with a bit of warm water and pat dry with a clean, dry towel.
Do not try to pull off the stump! Allow it to fall off on its own., If you have a newborn son and you decide to have him circumcised, then you will need to monitor and clean the circumcision site while it heals. It takes about seven to 10 days for a circumcision wound to heal and during this time the wound is susceptible to infection.


Check the area each time you change your baby's diaper. Clean off any stool or urine that gets on your baby's penis with some mild, unscented soap and warm water.
If you notice swelling, redness, or a cloudy, crusty fluid, then call your doctor. Your baby's circumcision wound may be infected., Sleep is integral to a baby’s health and well-being. Learning how much she needs can keep her happy and healthy.The recommended daily sleep needs for babies are:


Infants 0-2 months need 10.5-18 hours every day.
Babies 2-12 months need 14-15 hours every day.

, Fix a regular bedtime for your baby that includes a routine. This can promote and regulate sleep and help her relax her.Keep in mind that most babies don't have a specific bedtime in the first two to three months of life because they are still feeding every few hours.
Take naps, feedings, baths, and your baby’s age when figuring out her bedtime.Adjust your schedule for activities or other factors like illness., Babies usually need time to switch into bedtime mode. Help your little one relax with a bedtime routine and cozy environment.Start switching into bedtime mode at least two hours before bedtime.
Dampen any noise.Dim the lights in any spaces your baby might be. This signals her that it’s time to sleep.Gently talk to your baby and rub her back to relax. This can also help soothe her if she is fussy., Set up a nightly ritual at bedtime.Taking a bath, nursing or feeding, reading a story, singing, or listening to soothing music can signal your baby that it’s time to sleep.Reading or singing can help calm your baby.Give her a warm bath to stimulate sleepiness. A gentle massage may enhance her becoming sleepy., Create a room for your baby that helps her to sleep. Factors such as temperature, white noise, and shutting out light can put her on the road to a full night’s rest.A room temperature between 60 and 75 degrees is optimal for promoting sleep.Remove electronics or anything else that might stimulate your baby.Use soft bulbs and curtains or blinds to control light. A night light in a non-stimulating color like red can reassure a baby.White noise machine can dampen noises and help her sleep.Remove blankets and soft items from the crib or bassinet to minimize the risk of suffocation., Put your baby in her bed when she is drowsy but still awake. This helps her associate the crib or bassinet with sleep.In addition, it may also reduce the amount of nighttime care you provide.Lay your baby on her back in her bed.Let your baby to adjust and see if she falls back asleep if she rouses when you put her in the bed. If she doesn’t, hold her until she is drowsy.

, Establishing a bond with your baby as a newborn and throughout infancy is an important part of promoting her health and development. From soothing, cradling, and eventually playing with your baby, do activities that promote a bond between you and your child.You can bond with and stimulate your baby through a variety of activities including:


Massage or gentle stroking
Vocal stimulation such as talking, singing, reading, or cooing.Maintaining eye to eye contact at close range.Playing with age-appropriate toys.

, Most babies will invariably get cranky at times. Soothing her as she cries can help her to calm down and promote your bonding.Avoid sudden movements, bright lights, and loud noises so that you don’t startle your baby.Pick your baby up if she cannot calm down from crying.
Stroke her skin and speak to her in a soft voice to help her calm down.Swaddling newborns and babies under two months can help soothe them., No matter if you are using a carrier, car seat, or stroller, make sure that your baby is securely fastened into the unit. This can prevent injuries or even death.Learn how to properly secure your baby in carriers, strollers, and car seats. Most hospital will not allow you to leave without an appropriate car seat that you can properly use.Ask questions about using carriers, strollers, and car seats as you need. You can also read packaging instructions.
Limit activities that are too rough or bouncy, which can be dangerous for a baby., Many people feel overwhelmed when caring for a baby. Ask your partner, friends, or family members to help you care for your baby on occasion or when you need it. You may want to consider hiring a reputable babysitter you trust to give you some me time, too.Know that it’s okay to ask for help and that many people are willing to help out with babies.If you don’t have any close friends or family to help you, your doctor or local hospital may help you find someone to help you., Schedule regular doctor’s visits for your baby. In addition, if you have any questions or concerns, contact the pediatrician’s office. It’s better to be safe and ask questions than have something turn into a problem. Talk to your doctor right away if you think your baby has a fever or seems ill or is injured in any way.


Schedule regular doctor’s visits for your baby. Your pediatrician will check that she is thriving and developing according to schedule. In addition, she will make sure your child is vaccinated against diseases.
Your baby should see her doctor at regular intervals including: at birth, three to five days old, two to four weeks, two months, four months, six months, nine months, one year, 15 months, and 18 months.Note what each visit will entail so that nothing comes as a surprise. For example, at three to five days your doctor will check your baby’s weight, length and head circumference and ask questions about feedings, sleeping habits, and defecation.At two months, your baby will receive his first round of vaccines. At nine months, your doctor will check your baby’s size and developmental issues such as speaking, standing, and playing peek-a-boo."

Take blood tests during pregnancy.,
Reduce the risk of a preterm birth.,
Recognize that breastfed babies are more likely to develop jaundice.,
Begin breastfeeding immediately.,
Feed your baby frequently.,
Expose your baby to light.Ultraviolet light reacts with bilirubin, changing it into a form that does not need to pass through the liver in order to be expelled, thereby eliminating excess bilirubin from the body and reducing the risk of jaundice.,
Understand how jaundice develops.,
Know the symptoms of jaundice.,
Know when jaundice signals a problem.",How to Prevent Jaundice in Newborns," Certain blood incompatibilities can cause more blood cells to break down, producing more bilirubin.Mothers with Rh negative blood or O+ blood type should consider having additional blood work taken for their babies since Rh incompatibility and ABO incompatibility are among the highest risk factors.
Genetic enzyme deficiencies, like glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, can also lead to a higher risk of jaundice because they can destroy certain blood cells, creating more bilirubin in the blood stream.
In addition to prenatal blood tests, doctors now routinely test the baby for jaundice before the baby leaves the hospital.;
, Babies born before 38 weeks are at an increased risk of developing jaundice.The liver of a preterm baby is less developed than that of a full-term baby, making it even more difficult for the newborn's liver to eliminate bilirubin.Some preterm risk factors, such as age or multiple births, cannot be changed, but many environmental risks can.
Keep up-to-date on your prenatal care. Early and consistent prenatal care will ensure that you and your baby stay as healthy as possible during the pregnancy, which can pinpoint any problems that could lead to premature delivery.
Avoid chemical contaminants. Tobacco, alcohol, street drugs, and some medications can increase your chances of delivering early. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor. Environmental pollutants can also contribute a risk.Stay as calm as possible. Stress is a major factor in early births. Lack of social support, work that is physically or emotionally demanding, and domestic violence, whether physical or emotional, can all contribute to stress and lead to a premature birth.Monitor or reduce your risk of certain infections. Infections such as herpes, syphilis, CMV, and toxoplasmosis can lead to premature births as well as jaundice.

, However, it is usually easily treated and short lived.


Breast milk naturally does not come in until a few days after the baby's delivery. In the first few days of life, breastfed babies eat a pre-milk substance called colostrum, which is very scant in amount but dense in nutrients.
Because they do not drink as much as formula-fed babies in the first few days of life, their digestive systems are not emptied as quickly, which causes bilirubin to build up in the system. This is generally not a cause for concern, and experts still recommend breastfeeding.
Because breastfed babies often get a mild case of jaundice, it is not unusual for doctors to recommend supplementing them with formula in the early days of life if the baby is at higher risk for jaundice, until the breast milk supply is established.

, Nursing immediately after birth can help reduce the risk of developing jaundice and also begin to treat it if the baby already has it.


Mothers who begin breastfeeding within the first few hours after birth are more likely to have success than those who wait. Early weight gain can help a baby's development, making it easier for the liver to do its job.
Moreover, the colostrum a mother produces early on prompts the baby's digestive system to eliminate waste, which helps to expel excess bilirubin from the intestines. In other words, the sooner your baby begins pooping, the sooner the jaundice will begin to clear up.If you decide to breastfeed your baby, work with a lactation specialist to improve your breastfeeding technique. These professionals can help new mothers learn how to encourage proper latching so that newborns can receive enough milk.

, A steady supply of milk will increase your baby's weight and development, including the development of the liver. This is true for both breastfed and formula fed babies. Ideally, newborns should eat at least eight to 12 times daily for the first several days, especially if they are at risk for developing jaundice.If you nurse, frequent feedings in the first few days of life (at least eight to 12 times a day) will encourage your milk to come in sooner and establish a strong supply.

,


Expose a naked or diapered baby to sunlight for no more than five minutes at a time, once or twice a day. Do not exceed this amount, since prolonged sun exposure can cause a baby to burn very easily and create further complications. Ensure that the baby does not become chilled while sunning by raising the temperature in the room and/or laying the baby across your own chest while sunning.
Alternatively, try placing the baby's bed near a sunny window with curtains. Curtains and windows filter out many of the UV rays that can cause help problems, allowing your baby to take in sunlight without burning.

, Jaundice typically develops on the second or third day of life and generally follows a predictable pattern.


In healthy bodies, bilirubin is a normal byproduct that occurs in the blood stream as red blood cells are broken down. The bilirubin travels to the liver, where it is excreted into the bile duct and eventually in your stool. In cases of newborns with jaundice, the liver has not begun to work efficiently yet, so the bilirubin builds up in the liver and the blood instead of traveling to the bile duct.Newborns in hospitals are routinely tested for jaundice. It's very common — about 60% of full term babies will develop jaundice, and even more of those who are born preterm.In a typical scenario, a newborn infant will be tested for bilirubin levels by pricking the baby's heel and squeezing out a small amount of blood.
A baby with a bilirubin level of under 5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) is considered normal, while anything over 5 mg/dL is considered an elevated level.
Most babies with a low to moderate level of jaundice will not need treatment, and the jaundice will clear up after a week or two.
Sometimes, if the level is too high, rises too quickly, or does not go down after two weeks, doctors may prescribe light therapy (a UV therapy which is harmless and enjoyed by most babies).
In rare cases, your baby may need a blood transfusion to reduce severe jaundice.

, Most babies born in a hospital will be tested one or more times for their bilirubin levels, but certain symptoms can signal jaundice:


A yellow color to the skin and the whites of the eyes. This is the most common feature of jaundice.
Sleepiness and difficulty feeding. Sometimes bilirubin levels cause an infant to be drowsy, which can make nursing or bottle feeding the baby difficult.Try undressing the baby to rouse it to eat.

, Jaundice is very common and most often clears up on its own. But in some rare cases, it can cause complications and require treatment.


Although jaundice is common among newborns, high levels of untreated bilirubin (what is medically known as ""severe hyperbilirubinemia"") in the blood can cause bilirubin to pass to the brain, leading to serious complications.
Although rare, these complications can lead to permanent brain damage (cerebral palsy, learning problems, or developmental disabilities), improper development of tooth enamel, or hearing loss.Symptoms to watch for include lethargy, a bright yellow color, and yellow feet (especially the soles). Also poor muscle tone, an unusual, high-pitched cry, fever, or irritability may occur.
Your doctor may recommend supplementing breastmilk with infant formula if your baby's bilirubin levels continue to rise after a couple of days of life. In most cases, it is not necessary to supplement unless the baby's bilirubin level is 20 mg/dL or higher or if the baby has other risk factors for jaundice such as prematurity or blood disorders or is losing too much weight. Supplementing with formula can make it harder to establish a successful breastfeeding relationship.Talk your doctor about the pros and cons before supplementing.

Look for signs of pain during your baby's bowel movements.,
Keep track of your baby's bowel movements.,
Examine any stools that your newborn passes.,
Watch for any signs of blood in the stool or on the diaper.,
Increase your baby’s fluid intake.,
Use glycerin suppositories.,
Try massaging your baby.,
Give your baby a warm bath.,
Visit your doctor.,
Seek emergency medical care in serious circumstances.",How to Treat Constipation in Newborns," If your baby exhibits signs of pain while trying to have a bowel movement, it could be a symptom of constipation. Look if your baby makes painful faces, arches their back, or cries while trying to have a bowel movement.Keep in mind, however, that babies often strain during bowel movements because their abdominal muscles are underdeveloped. If your baby strains for a few minutes and then produces a normal stool, then everything should be okay.;
, An indication of infant constipation is long periods without a bowel movement. If you're concerned, try to remember when your baby last had a bowel movement.Write down whenever your baby has a bowel movement if your are worried your baby may be constipated.
It isn't uncommon for babies to have several days in between bowel movements. Typically if your baby doesn't have a bowel movement after five days, this could be a cause for concern, and you should contact your doctor.If your baby is less than two weeks old, contact your doctor if it has been more than two to three days between bowel movements.

, Even if your baby produces stool, she still may be suffering from constipation. Look for the following characteristics in your baby's stool to determine if she may be constipated.Small, pellet-like pieces of stool.
Dark-colored, black, or grey stool.
Dry pieces with little to no moisture.

, A small tear in the sensitive rectal wall may have occurred from your baby forcing the passage of a hard stool.

, Constipation is often caused by a lack of fluid in the digestive tract. Offer the breast or formula more frequently than you have been, up to every two hours.

, If dietary changes aren't effective, you can try using a glycerin suppository. This is gently placed into your baby's anus and helps lubricate stool. These are only meant for occasional use, however, so do not administer a suppository without first speaking to the baby's healthcare provider., Try massaging your baby’s tummy in a circular motion close to their navel. This may offer some comfort to your baby and help promote a bowel movement.


Try bicycling their legs to see if this helps.

, This may help him to relax enough to allow the passage of stool. You can also try placing a warm face cloth on your baby’s tummy., If any of these remedies don't help your baby's constipation, you should take them to the doctor right away. Constipation can cause a blockage of the bowel, which is a serious medical problem. Constipation in a newborn can be a sign of a other serious health problems. Your baby's doctor will perform a full exam and can prescribe a treatment that will alleviate your baby's constipation.

, Constipation can be a serious problem if paired with certain symptoms. Rectal bleeding and/or vomiting can indicate a bowel blockage, which is a life-threatening condition. If your baby exhibits constipation with these symptoms, visit the emergency room as soon as possible.Other concerning symptoms include:


Excessive sleepiness or irritability
Swollen or distended abdomen
Poor feeding
Decreased urination

Keep a record of how your baby’s poop looks.,
Look out for hard, small poops.,
Don’t worry if you occasionally see bits and pieces of undigested food in the poop.Sometimes food travels so quickly through the gut that it is not fully broken down.,
Contact your doctor when you see diarrhea of any color.",How to Analyze a Baby's Health by Poop or Stool Colors1," Maintain a running log of notes on your baby’s daily diet and the texture, color, and frequency of his or her bowel movements. Armed with this log, you'll be better able to detect abnormal defecation in your baby. Look for correlations between what the baby eats and how it defecates. Reduce the intake of problematic foods.


For instance, if your baby’s poo is normally brownish-green with a peanut butter-like texture, but then it suddenly turns dark yellow and becomes hard and small, think about dietary changes (including drinks) you might have introduced that could be the cause.
Pay attention to the consistency as well as color of bowel movements.
If your baby’s poo changes dramatically, you should talk to your baby's doctor. Share the information you’ve kept on your baby's stool with the pediatrician. The more details you provide, the better the doctor will be able to help you determine what's normal for your baby and when treatment may be necessary.;
, If your baby’s poo is like hard pebbles, s/he is likely constipated. Constipation -- the inability to pass stool as normal -- could occur when your baby is first introduced to solid foods. It might also mean that your baby has a soy or milk intolerance and could need a different kind of milk or formula.Introduce solid foods and more fluids to the diet slowly and monitor your baby’s ability to process them. If he or she shows signs of constipation, reduce solid food intake and add softer food(s) and more fluids to the diet.

, However, this does not indicate that the baby is unwell. Additionally, some foods such as corn are more difficult for the gut to break down. If you see small or occasional chunks of food in your baby’s poop, don’t fret.

, If your baby is passing soft or relatively firm stools that are green, yellow, or brown, you have nothing to worry about that. However, if the stool is one of those three normal colors but is excessively runny, it could mean your baby has an infection or allergy.Diarrhea in another color, such as red or black, could indicates blood is present in the stool.


Keep your baby hydrated. Give them plenty of fluids while they are experiencing diarrhea.
A large amount of yellow diarrhea could indicate the presence of giardia, a parasite.

"
"
Feed your baby a fiber-rich diet.,
Keep the baby active.,
Move the baby’s legs yourself.,
Play with your infant using toys that roll or move.,
Massage the baby's stomach after eating.",How to Prevent Infant Constipation1," Certain types of solid food are more likely to trigger constipation, like bananas, carrots, and rice cereal. Other foods can help prevent infant constipation, including prunes, pears, oatmeal, and barley cereal.Talk to your doctor about when is the best time to introduce solids and which solids your baby should be eating. Most doctors recommend waiting until about six months before offering solids.;
, Low activity levels can lead to constipation. Infants often need assistance if you think they are not getting enough exercise., Grasp the baby's lower feet and gently move the baby's legs in a bicycling motion if the infant is not yet crawling. Bringing the infant’s legs up and down can help the intestines work.

, These can help encourage the baby to roll over or crawl more frequently, increasing the baby's activity level. Your presence on the floor can also help the baby in moving around more, following you.

, A gentle belly massage can help ease constipation. Place your hand across the baby's stomach, three finger widths below the navel. Apply gentle pressure."

Recognize breastfed baby poop.,
Identify poop produced by formula-fed babies.,
Consider what can cause some other colors.",How to Analyze a Baby's Health by Poop or Stool Colors2," Poop of breastfed children can come in many shades. Your baby’s poop might be green, brown, or yellow. The texture might be seedy or pasty, and might be as runny as diarrhea.It will also, compared to normal poop, smell a bit sweet.


Yellowish to yellow-green, grainy poop is also normal starting at about five days after birth for breastfed babies. Your baby’s stool will be loose.
Green-brown, yellow-brown, yellow-green hues are all also normal for breastfed infants.

, Babies who are not breastfed will have healthy poop of either a mustard yellow or a brown color. Their stools are likely to be larger and less frequent than those of babies who are breastfed. The texture should resemble peanut butter.Medium brown poop is completely normal. Formula-fed infants may produce light brown and pasty stool.
Light-tan or yellow-tan poop is also normal. This tends to happen more in formula-fed babies.

, If your baby’s poop is of a normal consistency -- which, depending on the baby, could range from the firmness of hummus to peanut-butter -- other colors alone need not cause concern about your baby’s health. However, there are a wide variety of other colors linked to various foods.


If the baby has eaten berries that have become undigested, the poop may be of a streaked dark-blue color.Pumpkin or carrot might cause your baby’s poop to be orange due to the beta carotene (an antioxidant) within the vegetables. Orange poop might also result from a random mix of other foods.
Spinach, broccoli, and other green foods might dye your baby’s stool green.
Foods or drinks with food color or dyes can also change the color of the poop.
In addition, certain medicines can occasionally change the color of the poop, as well as lead to some diarrhea or constipation. For example, an antibiotic called cefdinir can cause orange poop, and iron supplements can lead to dark green poop.

"
"
Be wary of black poop.,
Get medical attention when you see white or light gray poop.,
Look out for lime green poo.,
Look out for red poop.,
Take precautions when you notice abnormal poop.",How to Analyze a Baby's Health by Poop or Stool Colors3," Tarry black or blackish-green poop is normal during the first few days after a child is born, and is referred to as meconium.However, if black stool persists several days beyond the day of birth or appears after the neonatal period, you should contact a pediatrician. It may be due to blood in the stool from intussusception (intestinal blockage) or internal bleeding. Specks of black might also be present in the stool due to the ingestion of blood during breastfeeding., Chalky white or light gray stool can indicate a bile duct, gallbladder, pancreas, or liver problem. Those colors likely indicate that your baby is not producing enough bile, has a blockage of the bile duct, or has some other digestive issue probably involving insufficient bile., Lime green poo could indicate that your baby has a milk allergy. It might also mean your baby is not getting enough hindmilk. Hindmilk is the richer, more nutritious breast milk that can only be accessed through extended suckling.Finally, lime green poo could mean your baby has a virus.


Slimy green streaks or flecks in the poop can indicate the presence of mucus.This could be due to a viral infection, especially if the baby is sick or has a fever, or it might also simply be due to your baby swallowing excessive saliva/drool. If your baby is experiencing other signs of illness -- vomiting, lethargy, fever, poor appetite, or coughing -- contact a doctor when you see green-flecked poop. Otherwise, don’t worry if you observe a bit of mucus in your baby’s poop.
Contact your pediatrician for more information if you see lime green poo.

, A temporary change to red or rosy pink poop is often a result of having eaten something red, and is not a cause for alarm. Beets, tomatoes, red cereals, red popsicles, or red gelatin could each cause your baby to produce red or pink stool.However, it might indicate blood in the bowels. Contact your doctor if you cannot link your baby’s red poop to something it ate, or if you see obvious blood in the poop or the diaper.


Red poop could suggest that your baby has a milk allergy, internal bleeding, or a bacterial infection., Contact your baby's doctor if his or her poop is one of the warning colors (white, black, or red that cannot be linked to a food). Similarly, contact the doctor when your baby’s poop is thin, watery, or small and hard. Finally, if your child is not pooping as regularly as they usually do, they may be constipated.


If your infants attends day care or is cared for by someone else during the day, inquire with them about the frequency, quality, and color of your baby’s poo.

"
"
Watch the baby and diaper for signs of constipation.,
Note changes in the frequency of bowel movements.,
Ask the baby's pediatrician for advice.",How to Prevent Infant Constipation2," Constipated babies will experience pain and discomfort during bowel movements. Feces in the diaper will look harder and drier than normal, often like small dry pellets or large dry balls. This typically happens only after a baby begins to eat solid foods, not while he or she is still only consuming breast milk or formula.

, Although frequency on its own is not a reliable indicator of constipation, sudden changes in an infant's typical elimination schedule can signal baby constipation or a diarrheal problem. Healthy breastfed babies may go up to a week between bowel movements, but formula-fed babies who do not experience a bowel movement for two to three days and experience obvious discomfort while passing a stool may be constipated., If the baby experiences persistent and severe constipation that is not affected by dietary or activity level adjustments, a doctor can assess whether there are any underlying causes for the constipation. You can also insert a glycerin suppository to help a baby pass a hard stool, but check with the doctor. Constipation is very common in babies, but some infants may experience constipation as a symptom of hypothyroidism, food allergies or other medical conditions. Hirschspring's disease can cause constipation, but it is a very rare congenital condition. A doctor will usually be able to diagnose a baby suffering from the disease during the first weeks of life.The doctor may occasionally recommend a medication for your baby's constipation if it is severe or if she is not responding to dietary and activity changes.

"
Keep the baby adequately hydrated and at a comfortable temperature.,
Provide the baby with water or juice if the baby is older than four months.,
Switch the type of formula you use.,
Increase fiber-rich foods.",How to Prevent Infant Constipation3," Dehydration can cause or exacerbate constipation. Offer a bottle or the breast frequently to keep up the baby's fluid intake, especially during warm weather., Fruit juices draw fluid to the intestines and can help loosen stool. Start with 2 to 4 oz. (60 to 120 ml) of water, prune, apple or pear juice once or twice a day. But talk to your doctor about how much water or juice is safe for your baby., Discuss any changes in formula with the infant's pediatrician before making any changes. The doctor may have specific recommendations based on the infant's medical history and symptoms. Infants may react badly to certain ingredients in a formula. You also might ask the doctor if he or she would recommend adding prune juice to the formula to help loosen the stools., When feeding a constipated infant, avoid those foods that are more likely to trigger constipation, like bananas, carrots, and rice cereal. Instead, feed your baby prunes, pears, oatmeal, and barley cereal to help move her digestion along.

Do a safety tour of your home office first.,
Protect your baby from electrical perils.,
Prevent entanglement.,
Be conscious that while your child is with you, you may not really be all ""there"" in terms of being conscious of what your child is doing.,
Be aware of the sharp objects in an office that can attract curious hands.,
Be mindful of where you place hot items.,
Ensure that the floor is comfortable.,
Consider air safety.,
Be attentive.,
Utilize any and all appropriate child safety devices in your office.,
Place documents out of reach.,
Store any favorite, valuable or precious office items inside a safe.,
Lock your computer.",How to Babyproof a Home Office," Make a list as you walk around all of the potential hazards and harmful things, so that you can follow up each one and check it off as it's done. Bear in mind that you might discount potential hazards if you don't get down and look at things from the level of a baby, so kneel down in different spots to check out things from a lower level as well.;
, Put plug protectors over any outlets. This stops the baby from sticking his or her little fingers or small objects in the outlets and getting electrocuted.


Keep the paper shredder well out of reach and only turn it on when you're actually using it. When not in use, pull its plug right out of the mains, every single time. Do the same for any other potentially dangerous office equipment.

, Make sure that all wires, cords or hanging things are near the wall so the baby doesn't pull things down, crawl into them or become tangled up in wires. Tuck away cords using cord tidies and wall clips and make sure that any cord that has to run along the carpet or floor is tightly taped down with strong tape so that the tape can't be pulled up or the floor cord tripped over. Use flexible plastic cable to cover cords and if you use power strips, choose the ones with automatic shutting covers to prevent access to unused points. Beware if blind cords too. Ensure these are child safe ones if you have them.


Make sure there are no fragile or heavy things on top of the desk or bookcase.
Bracket or attach all tall furniture to the wall, such as bookcases and stands, so that they cannot be pulled over or fall onto baby. This is standard practice for those living in zones prone to earthquakes and is good practice for everyone.

, Work will swallow up your attention and you may not be able to keep a constant eye on your baby's wanderings around the home office. For a baby not yet able to crawl or walk, this won't be such an issue; just provide a comfortable bouncing seat or bassinet and some age suitable toys. For an older baby though, place him or her into a special part of the home office. A playpen is a great option for babies who would otherwise be crawling around and you can add suitable toys, books and comfort items such as blankets. For older children, set up their own ""mini office"" consisting of a pint sized desk and chair with suitable crayons, paper, etc. for them to play with. An easel could be a good choice too.


If your office is on a different floor or far away from the play room or nursery, keep a crib in your office so you don't have to keep checking on the baby.
Keep toys and books in a ""play box"". This will keep the baby happy while you work if you want the baby in the office all day.

, The home office can contain sharp problems such as push pins, paperclips, file pins, the edges of filing cabinets and desks, pens, etc. Keep all pens, pencils, markers, and sharp instruments in the top drawer or box out of reach of the baby. Always shut drawers after you have removed the item needed; have a well labeled filing system so that you know exactly where things go back rather than relying on leaving drawers open ""at the spot"".


Also take note of heavy objects such as glass or stone paperweights, large books, etc. and be sure to keep these well out of baby's reach. Also be sure that these things aren't at risk of being bumped off desks, shelves, etc., by you or any other older person in the office space. Keep heavy books on the bottom level of book shelves. They'll be too heavy for baby to pull out but if they do somehow fall out, they don't fall a long way and therefore have less force.
Pick up nails or small things the baby can choke on and put in another box or drawer.

, If you have hot drinks, keep them well away from the edges of your desk. If you keep a kettle in the home office, be sure that it is unable to be accessed by your baby. If there is a microwave in the room, keep it up high.

, If the home office has a wooden floor, put down rugs or carpet, at least where your baby is located, to make it softer and to protect your baby. Cushions, pillows or other soft items might be suitable additions.


Keep the floor clean. Vacuum, sweep or mop the floor regularly (preferably daily), so that it remains in a clean state.

, The air quality inside of our homes is not the best and some rooms are worse than others thanks to the emissions from the items we own and use. In the home office environment, be especially conscious of the emissions from printer ink, electronics such as computers and any stationery products and office furniture that might off-gas. Keep the home office environment well ventilated at all times and during warmer days, keep a window open to let in fresh air. Make use of plants to clean the air but also ensure that these plants don't present a potential hazard for your baby through ingesting or being poked by them.

, As your baby ages, he or she will explore and discover new things that you might not have expected to be of interest. Remove anything potentially harmful from reach or access as it becomes clear that your baby is curious about it.

, These include latches, outlet covers, and corner guards.

, Store your documents on a high shelf or in a locking filing cabinet where they can not be ruined by your children. You could also place them in a locking briefcase.

, This will keep these items totally safe from not only marauding children but thieves, clumsy pets,vandals, arsonists and the forces of nature. Better safe than sorry, literally. This may seem a bit over the top but there's no point having a safe if you don't use it and you may be able to negotiate lower insurance costs if you can prove your items are secure.

, This will prevent your child from deleting files and changing settings. You will need your files for work, you don't want to disappoint a client because little Johnny deleted his tax return, or whatever.

Remove all tags from new clothes, blankets, and sheets.,
Sort through hand-me-downs thoroughly.,
Wash baby's clothes as you would any other clothes.,
Throw the clothes in the dryer.,
Fold laundry and put away.,
Keep baby's dirty clothes in a separate basket.",How to Do Baby's Laundry," Make sure you check for stickers too. If you leave stickers on your clothes, the adhesive will melt into some types of material, leaving a permanent scratchy crust spot on those cute new outfits.;
, Hand-me-downs can sometimes be stained or moldy from sitting for a long time.


Since you don't want your new baby wearing moldy clothes, you could try washing these clothes separately with hot water, detergent, and, optionally, vinegar.
Make sure all mold is gone and that there is no lingering smell of mildew. It may take a few washes and don't get upset if you can't save them all.
Hot water or (for white or pale clothes) chlorine bleach will kill all the mildew, though harmless stains might remain.
Wash a final time with the rest of your baby's clothes.

, It's best to use fragrance-free, dye-free detergent, sometimes called a ""sensitive skin"" detergent and skip bleaches, softeners, and stain removers. Tide Free and Clear, and Method are all great detergent choices. Watch out for detergents with strong perfumes or bleach because they may irritate baby's delicate senses and skin.


""Fragrance-free"" generally means without any fragrance, while ""unscented"" can mean either without fragrance or with only mild fragrance to mask the sometimes-odd smell of active ingredients. Either may well be fine, but all else being equal, go with ""fragrance-free"".

, There's no need to use dryer sheets for baby clothes, but if you do use them use something suitable for sensitive skin, without strong perfumes.


Baby clothes can also be dried on a clothes line. Sunshine on diapers is an excellent method to ensure they are thoroughly clean.

, Choose an organization method that will be easy for you to use. Be realistic about the clothes that baby will wear most often and where baby will sleep. Put clothes, like sleepers, in the easiest point to access, like a drawer of baby's changing table or the dresser in your room.

, Baby will go through laundry quickly in the early days due to diaper leaks and spit-up, or maybe just because you wanted to see him/her in a different outfit. If baby's clothes are kept separate and organized, it's easier to keep track of them and know when you'll need to wash more.

Look at the fireplace from a baby's point of view.,
Buy a fireplace gate.,
Avoid freestanding screens.,
Install a fireplace door.,
Lock fireplace doors when not in use.,
Check any installed locks.,
Move fireplace tools out of reach.",How to Baby‐Proof a Fireplace1," When you get on your hands and knees, you have a better perspective to see what they see. Take notes of anything you think might be dangerous like sharp edges, hot spots, and interesting looking items that might attract a child's attention.


Remove any flammable items from the immediate area near the fireplace.
You will need to baby-proof based on your child’s developmental stage. If they can crawl, they will not be able to reach as high as if they know how to walk.
The best time to baby-proof is before your child can harm themselves, so consider baby-proofing the fireplace before your baby can crawl or walk.;
, A fireplace gate is a great way to create distance between your child and the fireplace. You can purchase fencing to go around the fireplace that will keep your child from coming within feet of the fireplace.Never leave your child unattended near a fire, whether there is a gate present or not.A fireplace gate can be used with fireplaces that are freestanding if you purchase a gate that fully encompasses the entire fireplace.
For a fireplace that is built into a wall, you should purchase a fireplace gate that you can anchor to the walls next to the fireplace.

, Babies and toddlers can easily pull down a freestanding gate and they can fall into the fireplace if they lean on the gate.Buy a gate that is specifically designed for a fireplace instead; it will be made of heat resistant material that will not get hot to the touch. They will also be difficult to bring down if your toddler accidentally topples on it.

, Fireplaces without doors can be more dangerous for families with small children because there is not a barrier between your child and a burning fire. Consider installing a fireplace door to your open fireplace to eliminate this hazard.


Glass doors get very hot very quickly when the fireplace is in use. Make sure there is a barrier, like a fireplace gate, around the entire fireplace so a child cannot touch the hot glass.

, Babies and small children will be curious to see what’s inside the fireplace so always lock the door when not in use. Consider buying a childproof door lock, like those you may use in a kitchen or with cabinets.


If the fireplace is decorative and you do not use the fireplace for heating, a plastic zip tie can effectively keep the doors shut so your toddler doesn't pinch their fingers.

, Some fireplace doors have built-in locks to secure them. If you have this type of door, check the locks to ensure that they're functional and that your child cannot open them.

, The tools should be in a location where adults can access them if needed, but a child cannot.


Ensure that any matches and lighters are out of your child’s reach.
Keep any fire accelerants, like lighter fluid, in locked cabinets away from a child's reach.
Keep decorative iron fireplace tools out of reach such as in a locked cabinet or within the fireplace fence.
Keep necessary fireplace tools, like a fire stoker, ash can, coal rake, and others out of your child’s reach.

Buy a larger fireplace gate.,
Buy a hearth pad.,
Install interlocking floors.,
Add hearth cushions.",How to Baby‐Proof a Fireplace2," If you have a hearth that extends past the fireplace exterior, you will need to purchase a larger fireplace gate than if you did not have a hearth.


Fireplace gates ensure that your child is unable to reach the hearth where they can be seriously injured if they fall, especially on the sharp corners of a raised step hearth or fall on the hard material of a flat hearth. .

, If you have a hearth with a raised edge you will need to baby-proof the hard corners and edges of the ledge.A hearth pad is made of flame retardant material that runs along the corners and edges of the entire hearth. Hearth pads are usually attached to the hearth with glue or double sided tape, often referred to as hearth clamps., If you have a flat hearth, you can use interlocking floors, like those many parents use for play areas, to soften the hard stone and brick.


You should avoid using interlocking floors on the hearth when the fireplace is in use unless the floor material is flame retardant and does not retain heat.
The foam of the interlocking floors can help soften a child's fall on to the hard stone or brick of a flat hearth.

, If you do not use your fireplace you can add cushions or padding directly on top of the stepped or flat hearth to soften the area.


Never use hearth cushions if the fireplace is in use, as this is a serious fire hazard.
Hearth cushions can be a decorate way to hide the stone or brick of the hearth and to make it more comfortable for a child to sit on.
Do not encourage your child to sit on the hearth, as this encourages them to treat the hearth and fireplace as a play area when it really is a dangerous place to play.

Learn how to treat burns.,
Install an additional smoke detector.,
Install a carbon monoxide detector near the fireplace.,
Inspect your fireplace regularly.,
Schedule a professional inspection.",How to Baby‐Proof a Fireplace3," Baby proofing is not failsafe, you should always be prepared with basic first aid knowledge. If a burn is small and not severe, put cool water over the burned area and bandage the wound to protect it from infection.Baby-proofing will help to avoid accidents, but you should be prepared to treat injuries regardless of the safety measures in place.
Have your emergency medical information handy if your child ever does receive a more serious burn. Ask your pediatrician for first aid information and know where your closest hospital is.

, Every home should have at least one smoke detector that works properly.


Install an additional smoke detector in the room where your fireplace is located. Early warnings from fire can be the difference between life and death.
Check your fire detectors monthly and replace batteries each year. The National Fire Protection Association recommends that you replace all detectors every ten years., Carbon monoxide poisoning kills thousands of people across the world each year but can be easily prevented. All homes should have working carbon monoxide detectors but consider placing an additional detector in the room where the fireplace is located.Test your carbon monoxide detector monthly to ensure it is functioning properly.
Keep a window open, if possible, when a fire is burning to lessen any carbon dioxide the fire produces in the room.

, While you baby-proof your fireplace, there are important fireplace safety measures that you must take to protect your entire family:Check your fireplace chimney and outtake vents to ensure that no debris, like leaves, can block air flow. Keeping vents clean can help to reduce the risk carbon monoxide created by the fire in your home.
Inspect your fireplace flue with a flashlight to make sure it properly opens, closes, and seals.
If you have a gas-burning fireplace, make sure there are no cracks or damage to the glass doors. Test the gas shut-off valve and igniter regularly to make sure no natural gas is leaking into your home.

, Inspecting your fireplace on your own is important, but it is also important to have a licensed professional inspect your fireplace to ensure safety.


Call a licensed chimney professional or mason if you notice any structural damage to your fireplace.
The Chimney Safety Institute recommends that families who use their fireplace should have their fireplace and chimney inspected each year, if not more frequently."

Gather your supplies.,
Draw a ring around one of the cartons.,
Wrap the CDs in plastic cling wrap (or in a thin plastic bag) and set them on the mattress.,
Lay the cartons on top of the CD stack.,
Determine your mattress's safety.,
Check to see if a mattress has been tested.,
Make sure the bars and rails of your crib are safe.,
Do not place pillows, comforters, and toys in a baby's crib.,
Lie your baby down on his or her back.,
Place your baby in a crib alone.,
Use blankets carefully.,
Make sure relatives and babysitters know safety precautions.",How to Assess the Safe Firmness of an Infant Mattress to Prevent Asphyxiation," A few simple household supplies can be used to test the safety of an infant's mattress. If you don't have all the supplies, you can get most of them at a department store. You will need the following:A ruler
A pen or marker
Plastic cling wrap or a thin plastic bag
Two full, one-liter (or one-quart) cartons of milk or juice, in square bottom cartons
A stack of 12 CDs or DVDs;
, Take your pen or marker, and your ruler. Place your ruler at the bottom edge of the carton. Measure up an inch and a half (40 mm). Make a mark here and then draw a line running parallel to the bottom edge.Draw similar lines on the other three sides of the carton. You should now have one carton with a ring drawn all the way around it.
It is not necessary to repeat this with the other carton.

, Wrapping will make sure the CDs stay in a pile. It will also prevent damage to the CDs. Stack all 12 CDs up in a neat pile. Wrap them securely.Make sure to take the CDs out of their cases.
When you are done, set the CDs on the mattress. Pick the softest part of the mattress. This is important. Your baby could roll anywhere on the mattress during the night, so it's important to test the softest part and, especially, where the baby's head will be placed.

, Start with the carton with the ring on it. Line up the edge of the CD stack with the ring you drew earlier.The cartons should be lying on their sides.


Put the second carton on top of the first one, also on its side. Place it however you need to in order for the cartons and CDs to balance horizontally.

, A mattress should be firm enough that an infant is not at risk of suffocating if he or she sinks into the mattress. Look at the overhanging portion of the lower carton. This is the portion below the ring you drew earlier. This should not be touching the mattress.If the overhanging portion of the carton does not touch the mattress, it is safe for use.
If the overhanging portion is touching the mattress, the mattress is too soft. You should replace it. You want to make sure the mattress you use is safe for your baby.

, While testing is not required everywhere, some mattresses are tested prior to being sold. Check the packaging of any mattress you purchase. See if it says anywhere on the packaging that the firmness has been tested for safety.Keep in mind, you should still test any mattress you purchase yourself. While mattresses may be tested in the factory, there's still a chance a soft mattress slipped through the cracks.

, The mattress in the crib is not the only thing vital to your baby's health. You should also make sure the rails and bars are safe enough to keep your baby from rolling or crawling out of the crib.The bars on a crib should be no more than 2 and 3/8 inches apart. You do not want a baby to stick his or her head through the bars.
The top of a crib's rails should be at least 26 inches from the top of the mattress. You may have to lower the mattress periodically as your child gets taller.

, Your child could smother on these objects in his or her sleep. Your baby may also use toys to get a leg up over the crib as he or she gets older.Do not use crib bumpers or bumper pads either.
If you want to keep your baby warm, it's better to layer him or her in clothing. This is safer than covering your baby with a blanket.
However, babies do not always need extra bundling. A room temperature between 70 and 72 degrees is usually enough to keep a baby warm at night.

, Many people believe it is dangerous to lie a baby on his or her back because the baby may choke on saliva. Babies can easily clear themselves of fluids, even when placed on their backs. It is actually safer to lie a baby on his or her back.Babies can breathe easiest when lying on their backs. There are no obstructions keeping them from breathing.
If babies spit up in their sleep, they can easily swallow the spit when lying on their backs.
Check with your doctor to see if your child has health concerns that might change their safest sleeping position.

, You should not co-sleep with an infant. You should also not have two infants share the same crib. Babies should always sleep alone.You should also avoid napping with a baby on the couch or in a bed.

, The less you place in the crib, the better. If you do use a blanket, only use a thin blanket. Do not pull the blanket further than height of the baby's chest.Keep your baby's arms outside of the blanket.
Tuck the blanket in to the sides and bottom of the crib. This will keep it secure, preventing your baby from pulling it over his or her head at night.

, Everyone who cares for the baby should know safe sleep conditions. Relatives and baby sitters should be well-informed on how to put your baby to sleep. This is especially important if you leave your baby overnight.It may be a good idea to have instructions taped or pinned up near the baby's crib.

Over half of babies experience a diaper rash at least once every two months. Learn to recognize the most common symptoms of diaper rash so that you can begin to treat it immediately. Symptoms of diaper rash include:


Bright pink or red skin around your baby's groin, thighs, and bottom
Dry, inflamed skin around the diaper area
Bumps or sores
Your baby might also act fussier than usual when experiencing diaper rash;
, Many diaper rashes can clear up on their own, as long as you use proper diapering techniques. You can avoid using diaper cream if you make sure your baby's diaper is changed frequently and that your baby's skin is clean and exposed to the open air. Proper diapering technique involves:


Changing diapers frequently — about every two hours or so, and after every poopWashing your baby's bottom gently with warm water: do not rely solely on baby wipes to clean stool off of the skinOnly using a mild soap when cleaning stool off of the skin: do not use soap every time you wash your baby's bottomUsing baby wipes that are unscented and alcohol free
Giving your baby a lot of naked time to allow the skin to dry and breathePatting your baby dry instead of rubbing (rubbing can irritate the skin)Fastening a new diaper only after your baby's skin is completely dry and has had some time to breathe
Making sure the fresh diaper is loose, not tight, on your baby's skinWashing cloth diapers very thoroughly to prevent the spread of bacteria — a vinegar rinse can help kill rash-causing bacteriaWashing your hands thoroughly after every diaper change, Most babies do not require diaper cream at every diaper change. In many cases, diaper rash can be prevented by making sure that your baby's skin is dry, clean, has exposure to the open air, and does not come into contact with stool.However, all babies who wear diapers will experience a rash at some point. If your baby only experiences diaper rash occasionally, use the cream when you see symptoms of diaper rash begin to develop: you will not need to use it as a preventive measure.

, Some infants are especially susceptible to diaper rash. If your baby experiences consistent, ongoing diaper rashes despite your reasonable precautions and proper diapering technique, you can consider applying diaper cream at each diaper change. It is possible that your baby has sensitive skin and requires extra skin protection., Diaper cream is very useful when your baby is experiencing a bout of diarrhea. Diarrhea can make it difficult for you to change diapers frequently enough to prevent a diaper rash, and the consistency of diarrhea makes it more likely to cause widespread skin irritation on your baby's bottom.If your baby has diarrhea, apply diaper cream between changes as a preventive measure.If your baby has serious, ongoing diarrhea, talk to your pediatrician. You do not want your baby to become dehydrated.

, Certain kinds of diaper cream are very thick: this can help prevent irritation. Other kinds of diaper cream are thinner and drier: this can help provide increased airflow to the affected area. In order to determine what consistency is best for your baby, talk to your doctor. He or she should have some sage advice about whether your baby's rash will do best with a thick paste or a thinner cream., Diaper creams can be purchased at most drug stores and supermarkets. If you care for an infant, you should have a tube of diaper cream handy to help prevent and heal diaper rashes. Look for a diaper cream with ingredients such as zinc oxide, calendula, and aloe: these substances help to soothe and protect red and inflamed skin.Petroleum jelly and other mineral oils are also common, safe ingredients.If your child has any allergies or skin sensitivities, be sure you read the ingredients of the diaper cream carefully to ensure that it doesn't make the rash worse. For example, babies with a wool allergy should not be exposed to diaper creams made with lanolin.
Most diaper creams are designed for use with disposable diapers. If you use cloth diapers, make sure that the diaper cream you purchase explicitly states that it is safe to use with cloth diapers.Only use creams that explicitly state that they are safe for infants. Stay away from adult-strength creams or any creams that contain boric acid, baking soda, camphor, benzocaine, diphenhydramine, or salicylates. These ingredients can be harmful to young children., Some babies are sensitive to certain common ingredients in diaper creams. If one kind of cream seems to irritate your baby's skin, try another brand with different ingredients. Use trial-and-error and careful observation to determine which kinds of cream are the best for your baby.


This advice also applies to other substances your baby will encounter, such as laundry detergents, soaps, cleansers, and fabrics. If you are having trouble finding cleansers that do not irritate your baby's skin, try to find unscented, alcohol-free substances that are hypoallergenic.

, Even if you purchase a non-toxic diaper cream, it is not safe for your baby or toddler to ingest. Make sure that you store your diaper cream in a place where your baby cannot suck on it or grab it, such as a high shelf or a baby-proof drawer. Keep your tube of diaper cream sealed with a safety lid.

, The best time to apply diaper cream is during diaper changes. Parents of very young infants will have to change their diapers every two hours and after every poop. Slightly older infants and toddlers might require less frequent diaper changes, since they do not urinate as frequently. Especially if your child has diaper rash or sensitive skin, you have to make sure that poopy diapers are changed as soon as possible: stool is the worst culprit of diaper rashes and skin irritation.If you baby has a rash, check your baby's diaper every hour during the day and once during the night to make sure it isn't dirty., It will be easier for you and safer for your baby if all of your supplies are within easy reach. Having your supplies close to hand means that you are less likely to have to leave your baby unattended during a diaper change. The supplies you need include:


A clean diaper
A towel or changing mat
Diaper cream
Warm water, or unscented, alcohol free baby wipes
Soft towels or washcloths
A waterproof bag or wastebasket for the soiled diaper

, Do not leave your baby unattended on any high surface. If your baby has diaper rash, it might be best to change your baby on a towel on the floor. That will make it easier for your baby to have some naked time later on.


If you use a surface above the floor, such as a changing table, ensure you buckle the child safely onto the table or mat.

, Take off any shoes or pants, and unsnap any body suits. Pull shirts up and out of the diaper area. You want to keep the area totally clear: this will help prevent your baby's clothes from becoming soiled. Diaper creams may stain, and removing clothing will help prevent unnecessary staining as well.

, Unfasten the pins of cloth diapers or the tabs of disposable diapers. Open the soiled diaper and pull it down and out from under your child. Hold on to the baby's legs to prevent them from accidentally kicking into a soiled diaper. You want your baby to remain as clean and bacteria-free as possible., A baby with a diaper rash will have very raw, sensitive skin. However, it is necessary to clean this skin thoroughly to make sure that she can heal properly. It is also necessary for you to clean away any old or stiff diaper cream from the last time you applied. Do not use scented or alcoholic baby wipes. Warm water is the best way to clean a baby with diaper rash. You can use a mild, scent-free soap if your baby had a particularly messy bowel movement.Use a squirt bottle filled with warm water to clean your baby. This helps prevent irritation from scrubbing or rubbing. You can also soak your baby's bottom in a tub of warm water for a few minutes. This will help soothe her bottom as well as cleanse it properly.Make sure that all urine, stool, and residue from earlier applications of diaper cream are removed.
If you have to use a cloth to finish removing traces of stool from your baby, be sure that you use a soft cloth, that you are very gentle, and that you rub front to back: never clean a baby from back to front., Using a very soft towel, pat your baby dry with a gentle blotting motion. Do not rub or scrub: this can irritate the skin further. Moisture helps to feed the bacteria that cause diaper rash, so your baby must be as dry as possible.

, Keep the child's bottom exposed to the air for as long as possible. Exposing your baby to the air is one of the best ways to prevent and heal diaper rash. Her skin will be able to dry and breathe, and the air discourages the growth of bacteria and fungus. If possible, give your baby at least 10 minutes of naked time during each diaper change., Get the new diaper ready to fasten beneath your baby's bottom and legs. Lift up his legs and slide the clean diaper underneath. Position the tabs at the back so that they are at the same level as the belly button.When your baby is experiencing serious diaper rash, you might want to consider going up a size in diaper for the next few days. A loose diaper will help encourage airflow and healing, and will prevent a buildup of moisture., You can choose to use a glove or a clean tissue if you wish. Spread the cream onto any inflamed areas and in the immediately surrounding skin. Pay particular care to apply the cream around the anus, genital area, and folds of skin around the thighs. Feel free to apply as much cream as necessary to cover the skin beneath a diaper. The cream should create a nice thick layer to protect the rash from moisture. Just as with cleaning your baby, try to apply the cream using front-to-back motions instead of back-to-front motions: this will help prevent uterine tract infections in your baby.


Try to avoid touching raw or inflamed skin too often: simply dab it on and avoid rubbing or touching it further.
Some diaper creams have a nozzle that will allow you to squeeze the cream directly onto your baby. This can be especially useful if your baby has particularly raw or sensitive skin that you do not want to irritate by touching directly.
If your doctor has given you prescription medication, be sure to follow her instructions. There are some ointments that are designed to work alongside over-the-counter diaper creams, while other ointments replace over-the-counter diaper creams. Ask your doctor how a prescription cream and diaper cream might work together., Some diaper creams are quite sticky, which can cause a baby's diaper to stick to her skin. This might cause further irritation. To help decrease this stickiness and to encourage proper airflow, consider adding a layer of petroleum jelly. A small coating of petroleum jelly on top of the diaper cream will keep your baby's diaper fitting loosely and flexibly, which will encourage healing.You may even choose to use petroleum jelly as the diaper cream in some cases.

, Pull the front of the clean diaper up and even with the back. Fasten tabs at a comfortable yet secure tightness. You want the diaper to be a bit looser than normal to help encourage healing and to prevent chafing.

, Once your baby has been cleaned, changed, and has fresh diaper cream, you can dress him in whichever clothing you like. It is good to give your baby as much naked time as possible, however — aim for at least 30 minutes a day of naked time.


If your baby soiled his clothing, be sure that you give him brand-new clothes. You do not want bacteria to spread and worsen the diaper rash.

, Because diaper rashes are caused in part by the spread of bacteria, you have to make sure that everything is clean after the diaper change. Your baby's clothing, the changing table, your baby's hands and feet, and your own hands all have to be thoroughly washed if they came into contact with your baby's stool or urine. Use warm water and soap to wash your hands (and your baby's hands, if necessary). Dispose properly of any soiled items, and place soiled cloths in the laundry to be washed.

, A regular diaper rash should be gone within three days of treatment.However, sometimes skin infections, fungal infections, or allergic reactions can look similar to diaper rash: these conditions will require different medication and more time to treat. If your diaper cream is not relieving your infant's symptoms, talk to a pediatrician. You might need to switch diaper creams, perform an allergy test, or get a prescription-strength medication to resolve the issue.If you notice any abnormal symptoms--such as fever, pus, or open sores--talk to a pediatrician immediately."

Diaper and clothe the baby.",How to Bathe an Infant," Once the baby's in the bath, you won't be able to leave him or her for even a moment, so it's important to set out everything you need before you begin.


Gather what you need for the bath itself, including the tub, a cup for pouring water, gentle baby soap, two washcloths, and cotton balls for cleaning the baby's eyes and ears.
Optionally, collect a few bath toys for the baby to play with.
Lay out what you'll need after the bath, including a towel, a brush or comb, lotion or oil, a diaper, diaper ointment and a clean set of clothes nearby.
Have rubbing alcohol on hand to clean the baby's umbilical cord area if it is still attached.;
, Wear something you don't mind getting wet and soapy. Roll up long sleeves, and remove jewelry like watches, rings, and bracelets. Make sure your clothes don't have zippers or pins that could scratch the baby's skin. Many caregivers like wearing a terrycloth bathrobe while bathing a baby.

, Most baby tubs available are shaped so as to support the infant's neck and head. They usually have a mat or sling that prevents the baby from being completely submerged in water. Place the baby tub in a clean sink, bathtub, or on the bathroom floor, depending on the manufacturer's instructions.


If you do not have a baby bathtub, you may use a clean kitchen sink instead. Just make sure the faucet does not come near the baby's head. Faucet covers are available for baby-proofing your sink.
Do not use a full-size adult bathtub to bathe an infant. They are too deep, and it's difficult to make sure the baby doesn't slip during the bath.
If your baby bathtub doesn't have a tread on the bottom to keep the baby from slipping, line it with a washcloth or separate bathtub tread.

, Run the water and test the temperature. You may use your elbow, wrist or a special bath thermometer to make sure the water isn't too hot or cold. The water should be comfortably warm to the touch, but not as hot as you'd prefer for your own bath or shower.


If the baby still has his or her umbilical cord, simply fill a bowl with water so you can administer a sponge bath instead.
Always test the water before placing baby in the tub.
When in doubt, err on the cooler side; your hands are rougher than a baby's sensitive skin, so he or she will feel heat more acutely than you.
Do not fill the tub more than a couple of inches. Babies should never be submerged in water. As your baby gets a little bigger, you can add a bit more water, but never enough to come close to submerging the baby.

, Keep one hand supporting the baby's back, neck and head as you carefully lower him or her into the tub. Continue supporting the baby throughout the bath with one hand, and use the other hand to wash him or her.


Babies can be very wriggly and slippery, so be very careful once he or she becomes wet.

, Use a cup, or your cupped hand, to get the baby's body wet. Use a soft washcloth to gently wash the baby's face, body, arms and legs.


Use cotton balls to wipe the baby's eyes and ears.
If you wish, you can use a safe baby soap that is very neutral, but it isn't necessary; a gentle scrub and wash down are adequate to keep babies clean. Don't forget to get between all the little creases and behind the ears and under the neck, where spit-up and moisture tend to collect.
Use a little baby soap on a washcloth to wash the baby's hands and feet.
Clean the baby's genitals last, using a dab of baby soap if you wish. If you have a baby boy who is circumcised, gently wipe him with the wet washcloth. Wash girls from front to back to prevent infection.

, If it is necessary to wash the baby's hair, lean him or her back and gently massage water into the hair and scalp. Use the cup to pour clean water over the baby's head. You can use baby shampoo if desired, but there is really no need. Babies are born with all the natural oils needed to keep the scalp healthy, and shampoos can easily spoil this balance.


If you use baby shampoo, use your hand to create a ""visor"" to protect the baby's eyes from the soap.
Before rinsing, check again to make sure that the temperature of the running water is not too hot.

, Support the baby's head, neck, and back with one arm, and hold his or her bottom and thigh with the other. Place baby in a towel, being careful to cover his or her head.

, Dry the baby's body first, making sure to dry gently behind the ears and in the skin folds, so that no excess moisture is left there. Towel-dry the hair as much as possible.


Remember that the fine hair of a baby will dry quickly. Do not use a hairdryer, as it is unnecessary and potentially dangerous.

, Dab a little ointment on the baby's diaper rash or circumcision wound if you've been advised to by a doctor.


It's OK to apply baby creams, lotions, or oils if you'd like, but these aren't necessary.
If the baby still has his or her umbilical cord, use a cotton ball to lightly dab the area with rubbing alcohol.

, If you're about to put your little one down to rest, choose an outfit that's easy to to fit on him or her, preferably with snaps instead of buttons. You may also choose to swaddle the baby (see How to Swaddle a Baby for more information).

Drink plenty of fluids.,
Rest in a comfortable room.,
Dress your baby in light clothing.,
Provide a lukewarm bath.,
Give medicine.,
Check for a rise in temperature.,
Call your pediatrician.,
Prepare to go.,
Make sure your baby is up to date with all of her immunizations.,
Wash your hands.,
Don’t touch the “T” zone.,
Keep your baby home when he is sick.,
Avoid sharing.",How to Make a Baby with a Fever Feel Better," Keep your baby hydrated by providing plenty of fluids. Fevers cause excessive sweating and, therefore, the loss of fluids is greater and could lead to dehydration.Talk to your doctor about offering an electrolyte solution such as Pedialyte in addition to formula.


Avoid feeding your baby fruit or apple juice or dilute it with fifty percent water.
Popsicles or gelatin are also acceptable.
Avoid caffeinated drinks because they force urination and the loss of fluids.
Offer your baby his usual diet, but realize that your baby may not want to eat as much when he has a fever. Try offering bland foods such as breads, crackers, pastas, and oatmeal.
Infants who are breastfeeding should only drink breast milk. Keep them hydrated by giving them plenty of breast milk.
Never force your baby to eat if food is refused.;
, Do not overexert your baby or her temperature might rise. Instead, place your baby in a room with a comfortable temperature between 70°F to 74°F (21.1°C to 23.3°C).Avoid running the heater nonstop so that your baby does not overheat.
Same with the air conditioner. Keep it off so your baby doesn’t shiver and raise her temperature.

, Even heavy clothing on a baby can raise his temperature. Overdressing your baby can trap heat making your baby more miserable.Keep your baby comfortably dressed and cover him with a light blanket if the temperature is too cold in the room or you notice your baby shivering. Adjust the room temperature as needed to keep your baby comfortable.

, Not too hot and not too cold, a lukewarm bath could alleviate a fever.If you plan to give your baby a lukewarm bath, give her some medicine to make sure her temperature does not rise after getting out of the bath.
Avoid cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These will cause your baby to shiver and make the situation even worse.

, Be cautious giving your baby Tylenol, Advil, or Motrin. Read the label carefully to make sure you are giving the right dosage for the right age. It might even be a good idea to consult a healthcare professional before giving your baby a fever medication.Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) is usually what the doctor or nurse recommends for fevers in babies.
If your baby is under three months old, call the doctor before administering medication.
Do not go over the recommended dosage or there is a potential it could cause liver or kidney damage, or worse, it could be fatal.
Acetaminophen can be taken every four to six hours and Ibuprofen can be taken every six to eight hours as long as baby is older than six months old.
Keep track of what medicine you give, how much, and when you gave it, so as not to overdose your child.
For temperatures under 102°F (38.9°C), try to refrain from using medication unless the doctor or nurse suggests it.
Never give aspirin to babies it could trigger a rare, but fatal, disorder called Reye’s syndrome.

, Even a low-grade fever could indicate a serious infection in babies. Therefore, depending on the age of your baby, a significant rise in temperature demands a call to the pediatrician.For newborn babies up to three months old that have a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher, you should contact a pediatrician for instructions.
If your baby is older than three months old with a 102°F (38.9°C) and the fever lasts longer than a day, call your pediatrician.
If you are ever in doubt, make a call to the pediatrician just to be safe.

, If your baby has a fever but continues to play and eat normally, then there is usually no major concern at that time. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends calling a pediatrician if your infant is under three months old and has a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher. If your baby is older than three months and has a fever longer than 24 hours and has other symptoms such as coughing, earache, loss of appetite, vomiting, or diarrhea, call your pediatrician or visit an urgent care clinic.If your baby is not alert or comfortable when the fever subsides, is very irritable, has a stiff neck, or no tears appear when baby cries, contact your doctor right away.
If your child has any special medical problems such as heart problems, immune problems, or sickle cell disease, make sure to check with your doctor when he has a fever.
Call your doctor if your child has a fever that lasts longer than 48 hours and a decreasing number of wet diapers, or excessive diarrhea or nausea, as this could indicate an illness that should be evaluated.
Call your doctor if your child has a fever over 105°F (40.5°C) or has a fever for more than three days.
Dial 9-1-1 if your baby has a fever and seems confused, cannot walk, difficulty breathing, or lips, tongue, or nails become blue.

, If your baby needs medical attention make sure you take along all of the necessary information to ensure baby gets treated correctly and promptly. You should also be prepared to find out what to expect while you are at the doctor’s office.Record all of the necessary information about your baby’s fever: when the fever started, how long ago you took your baby’s temperature, and informing the doctor of any other symptoms.
Make a list of medications, vitamins, and supplements that your baby is taking and if your baby is allergic to anything.
Think about questions to ask the doctor like what is causing the fever; what kind of tests need to be performed; what is the best approach for treatment; and will my baby need to take any medications?
Be ready to answer the doctor’s questions: when did the symptoms begin; did your baby take medication and if yes, when; what did you do to try and alleviate the fever?
Prepare for the fact that your baby might have to be admitted to the hospital for observation or more testing if your baby is very ill or is younger than 3 months old.

, Keeping on top of your child's immunizations — including her yearly flu shot — will help decrease the likelihood of her getting sick., In nearly all situations, keep your hands clean since your hand is the direct part of your body that comes into contact with germs and transfers it to other parts of the body.Wash hands, in particular, before eating, after using the toilet, petting or playing with an animal, using public transportation, or after visiting a sick person.
Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly — front and back, between fingers, under your nails, and for at least twenty seconds with warm water and soap.
Keep hand sanitizer with you when you travel or do not have access to soap and water.

, The T zone consists of the forehead, nose, and chin that forms the letter “T” on the front of the face. The nose, mouth, and eyes that, located within the T, are the primary points of entry for viruses and bacteria to enter the body and cause infection.Guard against all bodily fluids that exit the “T” zone as well: cover your mouth when you cough, your mouth and nose when you sneeze, and wipe your nose when it is runny (then wash your hands!).

, Keep your child home and out of daycare when he is ill or has a fever to prevent spreading it to others. If you know friends or family are sick, try to keep your baby away from these people until they are well again., Try not to share drinking cups, water bottles, or utensils with your baby since this is an easy way to transfer germs from one person to another, especially from parent to baby, who has not built an adequate immune system yet.Avoid putting your baby’s binky in your mouth as a way to clean it and then putting it back into your baby’s mouth. Adult germs are powerful inside baby’s mouth and can easily cause an illness. The same goes for toothbrushes.

Spread out a square-shaped washcloth on your table.,
Fold the wash cloth in half diagonally.,
Roll the triangle up into a tight tube.,
Fold the tube in half.,
Fold the tube in half again.,
Wrap a rubber band about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the second fold.Keep wrapping until the rubber band is nice and snug.,
Tie a ribbon around the neck to hide the rubber band.,
Add a nose, mouth, and some eyes.,
Glue a large, white pompom onto the back of the bunny using fabric glue.,
Add an ice cube in the hole in the back of the bunny.,
Place the bunny on the 'boo boo'.",How to Make a Boo Boo Bunny1," Try to choose the softest washcloth you can find. After all, it will be going on ""boo boos.""


Try to find something measuring about 13 by 13 inches (33.02 by 33 centimeters).Use white, brown, or cream for a realistic bunny.
A soft color, such as baby blue or pastel pink, is ideal for a baby.
Consider using your child's favorite color.;
, You want to end up with a triangle shape. If your washcloth as a soft side and a not-so-soft side, then fold it so that the soft side is on the outside.

, Start rolling from the top, pointed part towards the flat, folded part. Make sure that you roll it up tightly, or the bunny will be too loose and drop the ice.

, You should end up with a narrow U-shape. The two loose ends will become the ears.

, Grab hold of the two loose ends and bring them toward the folded, center part of the U-shape. Hold your bunny tightly.

, This will make the head, of the bunny.

, Cut a 12 to 14 inch (30.48 to 35.56 centimeters) long piece of ribbon, and tie it around the bunny's neck in a bow.Position the bow just to the left or right of the ears.


Try to use a thinner ribbon. ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) would be ideal.You can use any color of ribbon you like, but consider using a contrasting color. For example, if the bunny is white, use a pink ribbon. If the bunny is cream colored, try a blue ribbon.

, Use fabric glue to glue a small, pink pompom to the middle of the face to make. Add some googly eyes right above the nose. Use fabric glue to attach them, even if they are adhesive.If you don't have googly eyes or pompoms at home, try one of the following options instead:


Draw the eyes, nose, and mouth on using a permanent marker.Make the nose pink, and the eyes blue or black. If you want, you can add some whiskers as well.
Sew or glue on a pink button for the nose, and two black or light blue buttons for the eyes. If you are using glue, be sure to use fabric glue.

, This will make the tail. Do not use a cotton ball, however; they fall off too easily, and can be swallowed by very young children.

, You can use a regular ice cube or ""reusable"" ice cube. Reusable ice cubes are made from plastic, so they don't get wet or soggy.If the hole is too small, you can carefully widen it with your fingers. This will move the rubber band closer to the front of the head.

, The washcloth doesn't allow the ice to touch the skin, so it numbs it in a more comfortable manner. This is what makes it more suitable for children than an ice pack.To help your child feel better, consider saying one of the following poems:If you fall and bump your knee,/Ask for a little help from me./I’ll hold a piece of ice for you./Your boo-boo will be good as new!
If a boo-boo has you feeling crummy,/Stick an ice cube in my tummy./Hold it to your boo-boo tight,/Soon everything will be alright!
When the tears begin to flow,/From a bruise or bump or blow,/Boo-Boo Bunny is so nice,/In its tummy holding ice,/Gently soothing all the while,/Sadness turning into a smile.
Boo Boo Bunny is here today,/To help your boo boo go away./This funny, fuzzy, furry friend,/Will cool the hurt to help it end./She'll make the ouch go bye-bye fast,/So hold her until the pain has passed./And when the boo-boo is all through,/She'll still be here to play with you.

Talk with your child's pediatrician.,
Give your child acidophilus.,
Try yogurt.,
Use grapefruit seed extract (GSE).,
Use pure, virgin coconut oil.,
Make a baking soda paste.,
Try a saltwater solution.",How to Get Rid of Thrush in Infants1," Before you proceed with any natural or homemade remedies, check with your child's pediatrician. The doctor will be able to confirm the diagnosis and give you a professional medical opinion about what treatment will be best for your infant. While many home treatments for thrush appear to be safe, keep in mind that your baby’s digestive and immune systems are still fairly immature, and your pediatrician may want to proceed with caution.;
, Acidophilus is a powdered form of the bacteria typically found in a healthy gastrointestinal tract. Yeast and intestinal bacteria balance each other in the human body, and often taking antibiotics or developing thrush allows a spike in yeast growth. Taking acidophilus may help reduce yeast growth and treat the causes of thrush in infants.Make a paste by combining acidophilus powder with clean water or breastmilk.Rub this paste in the baby's mouth once daily until the thrush clears up.You can also add one teaspoon of acidophilus powder to formula or breastmilk if the child is bottle feeding. Administer acidophilus once daily until the thrush clears up., If your child is able to swallow yogurt, your pediatrician may recommend that you add unsweetened lactobacilli yogurt to your child's diet. This works similarly to acidophilus, by balancing out the yeast population in your child's gastrointestinal tract.If your child is not old enough to swallow yogurt, try applying it with a clean cotton swab to the affected area. Only use a small amount of yogurt and supervise your child closely to ensure that he does not choke on the yogurt., Grapefruit seed extract, when mixed with distilled water and administered daily, may help treat the symptoms of thrush in some children.Mix 10 drops of GSE in one ounce of distilled water. Some doctors believe that the antibacterial treatment of tap water may reduce the efficacy of GSE.Use a clean cotton swab to apply the GSE mixture to your child's mouth once every hour during all waking hours.Swab the child's mouth prior to nursing. This may help reduce the bitter taste associated with nursing while the child is afflicted with thrush, and can help him return to a normal feeding schedule.If the thrush does not improve significantly by the second day of treatment, you may try increasing the strength of the GSE mixture by dissolving 15 to 20 drops of GSE into one ounce of distilled water, instead of the original 10 drops., Coconut oil contains caprylic acid, which may help fight the yeast infection that causes thrush.Use a clean cotton swab to apply coconut oil to the affected area.Consult with your pediatrician before trying coconut oil, as some children may be allergic to coconut oil.

, A baking soda paste can help treat thrush at the site of affliction, and can be used both on the mother's nipples (if nursing) and on the child's mouth.Mix one teaspoon of baking soda with eight ounces of water.Apply the paste to the mouth with a clean cotton swab.

, Mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt in one cup of warm water.Then apply the solution affected area using a clean cotton swab."

Try breastfeeding.,
If the hiccups happened organically, try giving your baby something to eat.,
If your baby is old enough, give them a drink.,
Slow down your feedings.,
Stop and burp your baby halfway through a feeding.,
Sit your baby upright during feedings.,
Make sure your baby is latched on correctly.,
Bottle feed in a way that reduces air intake.",How to Get Rid of Baby Hiccups1," Hiccups happen when the diaphragm gets irritated.Drinking a small amount of breast milk as it comes out slowly might give the diaphragm time to relax and go from herky-jerk back to its normal motion.;
, Again, the idea is that the act of swallowing may help regulate an out-of-whack diaphragm. Some ideas of things you might give your baby are:


Applesauce
Rice cereal
Mushed bananas

, A lot of people advocate drinking water from the ""wrong side"" (i.e. bending over, half-upside down), but this is obviously both hard and dangerous to make your baby go through. Best try to give your baby a water bottle (with a nipple adaptor, for example) or even a sippy cup if your child is old enough.

, When a baby takes in too much milk, too fast, it causes the stomach to distend, triggering hiccups in the diaphragm. Try feeding your baby about half as much, twice as often, instead of giving him or her one big feeding.That way your baby will take in less milk at a time, hopefully nipping those hiccups in the bud.

, Another way to slow down your baby's milk intake is to take a break halfway during each feeding. When you're ready to switch your baby from one breast to the other, pause and burp him or her gently before resuming feeding with the other breast. If you bottle feed, take a break to burp your baby when the bottle is halfway finished. This gives your baby the chance to digest some of the milk, reducing the chances that he or she will get too full and start hiccuping., Your baby's stomach may also be getting distended from swallowing too much air during feedings. Sometimes shifting positions can remedy this problem. Shift him or her to a more upright (30 - 45 degree angle) position during feedings so that air doesn't get a chance to settle in the stomach and cause the diaphragm to contract.

, If your baby's mouth isn't latching tightly to your nipple, he or she may be swallowing air during nursing. Do you hear a lot of gurgling, gulping sounds while you're feeding your baby? If so, work on latching techniques that create a better seal around your nipple.

, Holding the bottle at a 45-degree angle causes the air to settle at the end of the bottle, reducing the chances that your baby will swallow it. You can also purchase bottles designed to reduce the amount of air in the bottle."

Place the bunny on the 'boo boo'.",How to Make a Boo Boo Bunny2," Try to find the softest material you can find. After all, it will be going on ""boo boos.""


Something that measures about 13 by 13 inches (33 by 33 centimeters) would be ideal.
Use white, brown, or cream for a more realistic bunny.
A soft color, such as baby blue or pastel pink, is perfect for a baby.
Consider using your child's favorite color.

, Pick two corners that are opposite each other. Roll both of them towards each other until they meet in the center., Bring the two pointy ends towards each other. Make sure that the crease is on the inside., Grab hold of the two loose ends and bring them toward the fold/curved part of the U. Hold onto the bunny tightly.

, Keep wrapping the rubber band until it is nice and snug. This will make the head, of the bunny.

, Cut a piece of ribbon that is about 12 to 14 inches (30.48 to 35.56 centimeters) long, and tie it around the bunny's neck in a bow. Place the bow to the left or right of the ears.


Try to use a ribbon, ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) wide.
The ribbon can be any color you want, but the bunny might look more interesting if the ribbon is a contrasting color. For example, if the bunny is white, use a blue ribbon. If the bunny is cream colored, try a pink ribbon.

, Use fabric glue to attack a small pink pompom for the nose, and two googly eyes for the eyes. If you don't have any of these at home, try one of the following options:


Draw the eyes, nose, and mouth on using a permanent marker. Make the nose pink, and the eyes blue or black.
Sew on a pink button for the nose, and two black or light blue buttons for the eyes. You can also glue the buttons on instead using fabric glue.

, Do not use a cotton ball. Those fall off easily and do not last long.

, You can use a regular ice cube or ""reusable"" ice cube. Reusable ice cubes are great because they are made from plastic. They don't melt like regular ice does, so they get wet or soggy.


If the hole is too small, you can carefully widen it with your fingers. This will move the rubber band closer to the front of the head.

, The washcloth keeps the ice from actually touching the skin, making it ideal for young children. To help your child feel better, consider saying one of the following poems:If you fall and bump your knee,/Ask for a little help from me./I’ll hold a piece of ice for you./Your boo-boo will be good as new!
If a boo-boo has you feeling crummy,/Stick an ice cube in my tummy./Hold it to your boo-boo tight,/Soon everything will be alright!
When the tears begin to flow,/From a bruise or bump or blow,/Boo-Boo Bunny is so nice,/In its tummy holding ice,/Gently soothing all the while,/Sadness turning into a smile.
Boo Boo Bunny is here today,/To help your boo boo go away./This funny, fuzzy, furry friend,/Will cool the hurt to help it end./She'll make the ouch go bye-bye fast,/So hold her until the pain has passed./And when the boo-boo is all through,/She'll still be here to play with you.

Administer miconazole.,
Try nystatin.,
Try gentian violet.,
Talk to the pediatrician about fluconazole.",How to Get Rid of Thrush in Infants2," Miconazole is often the go-to treatment option for pediatricians treating thrush. Miconazole comes in a medicated gel that a parent or caretaker will need to apply to the baby's mouth.Wash your hands with antibacterial soap. You will need to have clean hands before applying any medication to your child.Administer 1/4 of a teaspoon of miconazole to the affected areas of the child's mouth, up to four times daily. Use a clean finger or a clean cotton swab to apply miconazole directly to the affected site.Do not use too much gel, as it may cause a choking hazard. You should also avoid administering the gel in the back of your child's mouth, as it could easily slide down his throat.Continue miconazole treatments until your pediatrician tells you to stop.
Miconazole is not recommended for infants under six months of age. The risk of choking is significantly increased in children younger than six months., Nystatin is often prescribed instead of miconazole, especially in the US. It is a liquid medication that is administered to the affected area in a child's mouth using either a dropper, medication syringe, or a clean cotton swab coated in nystatin.Shake the bottle of nystatin before administering each dose. The medicine is suspended in liquid, so it's important to shake the bottle so that the medicine is evenly distributed throughout the bottle.Your pharmacist should give you a dropper, syringe, or spoon to measure and administer nystatin. If your pharmacist has not given you a tool for measuring and administering nystatin, follow the instructions that came with the medicine.If your child is small, your pediatrician may recommend that you administer half a dose to each side of the child's tongue, or she may recommend that you use a clean cotton swab to apply the liquid to the sides of your child's mouth.If your child is old enough to follow your instruction, have the child swish the nystatin around his mouth to thoroughly coat the entire surface of the tongue, cheeks, tongue, and gums.Wait five to ten minutes after administering nystatin before feeding your child, if it is near his meal time.Administer nystatin up to four times daily. Continue administering the medication for up to five days after thrush has cleared up, as thrush commonly recurs shortly after treatment ends.Nystatin rarely causes side effects like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or stomach discomfort, or may cause allergic reactions in some children. Talk to your pediatrician about the possible side effects of nystatin before administering the medication to your child., If your child hasn't had any luck with miconazole or nystatin, your pediatrician may recommend that you try gentian violet. Gentian violet is an antifungal solution that is applied to the affected area using a cotton swab. It is available in most pharmacies without a prescription.Follow the dosing recommendations on the bottle or from your pediatrician.
Apply gentian violet to the affected areas using a clean cotton swab.Administer gentian violet two to three times daily for at least three days.Be aware that gentian violet will stain both skin and clothing. Gentian violet may cause your child's skin to appear purple while treating him with gentian violet, but this will clear up once you've discontinued use of the medicine.Talk to your pediatrician about using gentian violet, as some children may be allergic to the medication or to the dyes and preservatives used in gentian violet., If other methods fail, your doctor may prescribe your baby fluconazole, which is an antifungal medication that the child swallows once daily for seven to 14 days. It will slow the growth of the fungi causing your infant's infection.Follow your pediatrician's instructions on dosage.

Understand thrush.,
Reduce bottle time.,
Limit pacifier use.,
Sterilize nipples, bottles, and pacifiers if your baby has thrush.,
Talk to your doctor about discontinuing antibiotics.",How to Get Rid of Thrush in Infants3," Though thrush can be painful for your child and difficult for you as his parent, know that in most cases thrush is not particularly harmful to the child. Some cases of thrush clear up without medical treatment within one to two weeks.More severe cases may take up to eight weeks to heal without treatment, while a pediatrician's care can help thrush heal in as little as four to five days.However, sometimes thrush involves more serious complications, and could be indicative of a more severe problem. Contact your pediatrician immediately if your child:


Has a feverExhibits any kind of bleedingIs dehydrated, or drinking less than normalHas trouble swallowing or breathing
Has any other complications that you find worrisome, Prolonged sucking on a bottle's nipple may irritate your infant's mouth, making him more prone to an oral yeast infection. Limit bottle time to 20 minutes per meal. In severe cases of thrush some infants may be unable to use a bottle due to mouth pain. If this occurs you may need to switch to a spoon or syringe instead of a bottle.Talk with your pediatrician to find the best way to avoid further irritating your infant's mouth.

, Pacifiers are a great way to soothe an infant, but the constant sucking associated with pacifier use may cause irritation to your child's mouth and make him more prone to a yeast infection.If your child has or has had thrush, only give him a pacifier when nothing else will calm him down., To prevent the spread of thrush, it is important you keep milk and prepared bottles in the refrigerator to prevent yeast growth.You must also clean nipples, bottles, and pacifiers throughly with hot water or in a dishwasher., If a nursing mother develops thrush from taking antibiotics or steroid treatments, she may need to stop taking those medications or reduce the dosage until the thrush clears up. However, this should only be done if discontinuing or reducing the dosage of antibiotics or steroids will not cause medical complications for the mother.Talk to your doctor if you believe your medication is causing thrush.


This applies to any medications the infant is taking as well.

Try a little sugar.,
Massage your baby's back.,
Burp your baby.,
Try gripe water.,
Keep your child entirely upright.,
Distract your baby.,
Don't try any of the following methods.,
If all else fails, wait it out.",How to Get Rid of Baby Hiccups2," This suggestion might have started out as an old wives' tale, but some doctors are actually behind it.Put some sugar on a pacifier or your finger. Just lick your finger/pacifier and dip it into a sugar bowl. Have the baby suck on it for a few minutes, and the hiccups will most likely fade away.The (as of yet, very unscientific) thinking is that the effort required to swallow the sugar in its granular form disrupts the diaphragm back into normal, for lack of a better phrase.

Note: try to put only a little bit of sugar underneath the infant's tongue and encourage them to swallow the sugar quickly, before it dissolves.
Another way to do this is to dip a pacifier in sugar put it into your child's mouth.

, A gentle back rub may loosen your child's muscles, giving the diaphragm the okay to relax. Using upward motions, move your hand from the small of the back up to the shoulder, preferably while the baby is still upright. This technique may take several minutes to start working.

Another way to do this is to place your baby on the ground on his or her belly, and allow him or her to move around a little bit. This should help to get rid of any air bubbles causing the hiccups in the first place. Now gently rub your baby's back until the hiccups subside.







, This may help your baby to get rid of any excess gas in their system. They will normally give one last loud hiccup before it's over., Although there is no clinical evidence that gripe water is effective against the hiccups, many parents use gripe water to soothe intestinal discomfort in their children.

Dissolve a little bit of gripe water in a bit of water and administer it in a dropper. Note that your baby may be allergic to one of the many ingredients in gripe water, which includes alcohol, ginger, dill, and fennel, among others., Try to hold your baby upright if you can, or hold their hands as you get them to stand. Your baby may be suffering from reflux after eating something. In this case, doctors may advise to keep your child in an upright position for 30 minutes after eating.

, Distracting your baby with a game or toy can not only keep them happy when they have the hiccups, but can also help to get rid of them.



Play peek-a-boo
Give your baby a rattle
Give your baby a chew toy

, The following methods, while popular folk remedies, could actually hurt your baby inadvertently and are best avoided.These remedies include:


Startling your baby (what works for adults often doesn't work for children)
Pressing down on their fontanels
Pressing down on their eyeballs
Pulling their tongue
Slapping your baby's back.

, While hiccups are annoying, they're almost never a sign that something is seriously wrong. If your child hiccups for more than several hours or for more than a day, it's acceptable to visit your pediatrician. But for most parents, some good-fashioned hands-off patience should be just what the doctor ordered.

"

Examine your baby for other symptoms.,
See your pediatrician.",How to Get Rid of Baby Hiccups3," Sometimes hiccups are caused by gastroesophageal reflux. This is a common condition in which babies regurgitate contents from the stomach into the esophagus, causing pain and hiccups to occur. If your baby seems to have hiccups all the time, this might be the culprit. Here are other symptoms to watch for:


Colicky behavior
Stomach pain
Spitting up frequently

, If you're concerned that your baby might have reflux, it's important to see your pediatrician to look into treatment options. In many cases the condition is temporary, so your doctor may advise you to let it go away on its own."

Rub a small amount of mineral oil, baby oil, or petroleum jelly into the scaly patches.,
Shampoo the baby gently with a mild baby shampoo to remove the oil/jelly and scales.,
Brush the loosened flakes out of the baby’s hair with a soft brush.,
Make a gentle disinfectant out of natural remedies such as apple cider vinegar or baking soda.,
Comb out the flakes using a fine-toothed comb.,
Shampoo the baby to wash out any remaining apple cider vinegar or baking soda paste.,
Seek medical advice if home care does not help or your baby’s condition worsens.,
Follow any treatment prescribed by the doctor.,
Do not use over-the-counter medications without consulting a doctor.",How to Easily Clean Baby's Cradle Cap Dandruff Without Hurting the Baby," Allow the oil or jelly to soak in for 15 minutes. This will soften and loosen the crusts, making them easier to remove.Because chemicals can be absorbed through the skin, including the scalp, be sure to read the manufacturers’ labels on the products to be sure that they are safe for babies.
Don’t leave the oil/jelly on the baby, because this will make the crusts sticky and prevent them from naturally coming off.
Coconut oil and shea butter are common natural remedies that can be applied.Don’t use olive oil because it may encourage the growth of skin yeasts, or malassezia, and this may make the cradle cap worse.Wash the oil off with warm water.;
, This will also remove any natural oils that may have built up and caused dead skin cells to stick to the scalp, forming scales.While shampooing gently massage the scalp to soften and loosen the scales. This can be done with your fingers, a washcloth, or a soft bristled baby brush. Don't scrub your baby's skin too hard, or you could irritate it.Don’t use dandruff shampoos because they may contain chemicals that aren’t recommended for babies and could be absorbed through the skin.Thoroughly rinse all of the shampoo out of the baby’s hair to prevent irritation and if necessary, shampoo the baby daily.

, Strands of hair may come away with the flakes, but the hair will grow back. Don’t pick at the scales as this may cause an open wound which will make the baby vulnerable to an infection.Brushing the flakes out will be easiest after the bath when the baby is dry. When the flakes are wet, they will stick to the hair.

, This will help prevent the growth of bacteria or fungus.Mix one part apple cider vinegar with two parts water. Massage this solution into the cradle cap. Let it sit for 15 minutes or until dry. This will help dissolve and loosen the scales.
Mix a paste of baking soda and water. Use 1-2 teaspoons of baking soda and a 1:1 ratio of water. Dab the paste onto the infected area and let it dry on the baby for 15 minutes.
Do not apply vinegar or baking soda to broken skin or open wounds because it may sting. Instead, seek medical attention from a doctor.

, Gently comb against the hair slowly lifting and removing the loosened flakes.


A lice comb works particularly well. The thin narrow teeth will catch even the smallest flakes.
Do not scrape off flakes that are still attached to the scalp as this may hurt the baby.

, Be careful to avoid rinsing the apple cider vinegar or baking soda mixture into the baby's eyes.


Use a mild shampoo that is approved for babies' sensitive skin.

, Signs that your baby should be seen by a doctor include:


Symptoms of infection, such as bleeding, pus oozing from below the scales, or extreme redness, pain, or fever.
Swelling and severe itching causing the baby to scratch. This may be a symptom of another skin condition called eczema.Cradle cap occurring on areas of the body other than the scalp, particularly the face.

, If your baby’s cradle cap becomes infected or very inflamed or itchy, the doctor may prescribe one or more of the following to treat the infection and reduce inflammation:Antibiotics
Antifungal cream
A dandruff shampoo containing tar, antifungal medications such as ketoconazole, or selenium sulfide
A mild steroid cream such as hydrocortisone 1% cream

, Steroid creams, antifungal medications, or dandruff shampoos containing salicylic acid may be dangerous for the baby when absorbed through the skin. Your doctor may recommend steroid creams or antifungal medications in some cases, and you should always follow her instructions.


Dandruff shampoos containing salicylic acid are never used on babies.
Also consult your doctor before applying natural remedies with medicinal properties, like Calendula. Calendula is antiseptic and anti-inflammatory, but talk to your doctor before applying it to a baby."

Get ready for the ride.",How to Take Care of a Newborn," Newborns need to get lots of rest to continue growing healthy and strong -- some can rest up to 16 hours a day. Though once your baby is three months or so old, he may be able to sleep for 6-8 hours at a time, in the beginning, your baby may only sleep for 2-3 hours at a time and should be woken up if he or she hasn't been fed for 4 hours.


Some babies have their days and nights confused when they are born. If your baby is more alert at night, try to limit nighttime stimulation by keeping the lights dim and your talking low, and be patient until your baby begins a normal sleeping cycle.
Make sure you place your baby on his back to lower the risk of SIDS.
You should alternate the position of your baby's head -- whether it's leaning to the left or the right -- to eliminate the ""soft spot"" that can appear on a baby's face if he spends too much time sleeping with his head in one position.;
, If you want to breastfeed your baby, then feeding your baby the first time you hold her after she is delivered is a great place to start. You should turn your baby's body toward you, so you are holding her chest toward yours. Touch her upper lip with your nipple and pull her to your breast when she opens her mouth wide. Once she does this, her mouth should cover your nipple and as much of the areola as possible. Here are some things you should know about breastfeeding your baby:If the baby is getting enough food, it will produce 6-8 wet diapers a day, along with steady bowel movements, be alert when it's awake, and will steadily gain weight.
Don't stress if your baby has a hard time feeding at first; it takes patience and practice. You can get help from a nurse or even a lactation consultant (who can be helpful before birth).
Know that nursing shouldn't hurt. If the latch-on hurts, break the suction by placing your pinkie finger between your baby's gums and your breast and repeat the process.
You should nurse about 8-12 times during the first 24 hours of baby's birth. You don't have to stick to a strict schedule, but should nurse whenever your baby shows signs of hunger, from increased mouthing and activity to looking for your nipple. You should nurse at least every four hours, even gently waking your baby to feed her if necessary.
Make sure to get comfortable. Feedings can take up to 40 minutes, so pick a cozy spot that can give you back support when you're nursing.
Eat a healthy and well-balanced diet. Stay hydrated and be prepared to feel more hunger than normal and follow it. Limit your use of alcohol or caffeine because it will enter your breast milk.

, Choosing whether to formula feed or breastfeed your baby is a personal decision. While some studies show that breastfeeding may be healthier for your baby, you also have to consider your own health and convenience and a variety of other factors before making this decision. Formula feeding can make it easier to know how much you've fed your baby, to limit the amount of feedings, and to not have to restrict your own diet. If you do choose to formula feed your baby, here are some things you need to know:Make sure to follow the directions on the label of the formula when you prepare it.
Sterilize new bottles.
Feed your baby every two or three hours, or whenever he seems hungry.
Discard any formula left out of the fridge for over an hour or any left unfinished by the baby.
Store formula in the fridge no longer than 24 hours. You can carefully warm it because many babies prefer it that way, but it's not necessary.
Hold your baby at a 45-degree angle to help him take in less air. Cradle him in a semi-upright position, offering plenty of head support. Tilt the bottle so the nipple and neck are filled with formula. Never prop it, which can cause the baby to choke.

, Whether you're using cloth or disposable diapers, if you plan on taking care of your newborn, you'll have to be a diaper-changing expert, and fast. Whatever method you use -- and you should decide before you bring home your baby -- you should be prepared to change your baby's diaper around 10 times a day. Here what you have to do:


Get your supplies ready. You'll need a clean diaper, fasteners (if you use cloth diapers), diaper ointment (for rashes), a container of warm water, a clean washcloth, and some cotton balls or diaper wipes.
Remove your baby's dirty diaper. If it's wet, place your baby on his back and remove the diaper and use the water and washcloth to wipe your baby's genital area. Wipe girls from front to back to avoid UTIs. If you see a rash, place some ointment on it.
Open the new diaper and slide it under your baby, gently lifting your baby's legs and feet. Move the front of the diaper up between your baby's legs, over the belly. Then, bring the adhesive strips around and snugly fasten them so the diaper is nice and secure.
To avoid diaper rash, change your baby's diaper as soon as possible after a bowel movement, using soap and water to wipe your baby. Let your baby go undiapered for a few hours each day to let your baby's bottom air out a bit.

, During the first week, you should carefully give your baby a sponge bath. Once the umbilical cord falls off, you can start bathing your baby regularly, around two to three times a week. To do this the right way, you should gather your supplies, such as towels, soap, a clean diaper, etc, in advance, so that your baby isn't fussing around. Fill the tub or baby tub with about three inches of warm water before you begin the bath. Here's what you should do next:


See if you can get help. You may feel a little scared or uncertain when you bathe your baby for the first time. If so, see if you can get your partner or a family member involved. That way, one person can hold the baby in the water while the other person bathes the baby.
Undress your baby carefully. Then, slip your baby into the tub feet first, while using one of your hands to support the baby's neck and hands. Continue to pour warm cupfuls of water into the bath so your baby doesn't get cold.
Use mild soap and use it sparingly so you don't get it into your baby's eyes. Wash your baby with your hand or with a washcloth, making sure to gently wash your baby from top to bottom and from front to back. Clean your baby's body, genitals, scalp, hair, and any dried mucus that has collected on your baby's face.
Rinse your baby with cupfuls of warm water. Wipe your baby clean with a washcloth. Lift the baby out of the tub, continuing to use one hand to support her neck and head. Be careful -- babies are slippery when wet.
Wrap your baby in a hooded towel and pat your baby dry. After that, put a diaper and dress on your baby and kiss him so he has positive associations with being bathed.

, You may be intimidated by how tiny and fragile your newborn seems, but with a few basic techniques, you should feel more confident about handling your baby in no time. Here are some things you should do:


Wash or sanitize your hands before you handle your baby. Newborn babies are susceptible to infection because their immune systems aren't quite so strong yet. Make sure that your hands -- and the hands of anyone else who handles the baby -- are clean before you make contact.
Support your baby's head and neck. To hold your baby, cradle his head whenever you carry him and support it when you're holding the baby upright or putting him down. Babies can't hold up their own heads yet, so don't ever let a baby's head flop around.
Avoid shaking your baby, whether you're playing or angry. This can cause bleeding in the brain, which can lead to death. Don't try to wake up your baby by shaking it, either -- instead, tickle its feet or give it another gentle touch.
Learn to swaddle your baby. This is a great way to keep your baby feeling secure before he reaches the two month mark.

, You have to make sure to give your baby as much head and neck support as possible when you hold it. You should let the baby's head rest inside your inner elbow, with the length of his body resting on your forearm. His outer hip and upper legs should rest with your hand, with its inside arm resting over his chest and abdomen. Hold the baby snugly and give your baby all of your attention.You can also hold the baby by pacing his tummy on your upper chest, while using the same side hand to hold his body, while using the opposite hang to support the baby's head from the back.
If your baby has older siblings or cousins or is around people unfamiliar with holding babies, carefully instruct them on how to hold the baby and make sure they are sitting down with a knowing adult nearby to keep the baby safe.

, Since your baby spends so much of its time on its back, it's important to also give your baby time to stay on his tummy so that he develops both mentally and physically and strengthens his arms, head, and neck. Some doctors say babies should get 15-20 minutes of tummy time a day, while others say that you should just place your baby on his tummy for 5 minutes during different parts of the day as he develops.


You can start with tummy time as soon as a week after the baby is born, once the umbilical chord falls off.
To make tummy time fun, get level with your baby. Make eye contact, tickle your baby, and play around.
Tummy time is hard work, and some babies will be resistant to it. Don't be surprised -- or give in -- if this happens.

, Your baby's umbilical cord stump should fall off within the first two weeks of its life. It will change in color from a yellowish green to brown and black as it dries and falls off on its own. It's important to care for it properly before it falls off to avoid infection. Here's what you should do:Keep it clean. Clean it with plain water and dry it with a clean and absorbent cloth. Make sure to wash your hands before you handle it. Stick to giving your baby sponge baths until it falls off.
Keep it dry. Expose it to air so the base dries out, keeping the front of your baby's diaper folded down so it is uncovered.
Resist the urge to pull it off. Let the stump fall off at its own pace.
Keep an eye out for signs of infection. It's natural to see a bit of dried blood or a little bit of crust near the stump; however, you should see a doctor immediately if the stump produces a smelly discharge or yellowish pus, continues to bleed, or is swollen and red.

, If your baby is upset, it's not always easy to find the reason right away, through there are a few tricks you can try. Check for a wet diaper. Try feeding them. If that doesn't work, try adding a layer of clothing if it's cold out or removing a layer if it's hot. Sometimes, your baby just wants to be held, or is experiencing too much stimulation. As you get to know your newborn, you'll become better at finding what's wrong.Your baby also may just need to be burped.

Rocking them gently and singing or humming a lullaby to them will help. Give them a pacifier if that doesn't work. They might just be tired so lay them down. Sometimes, babies just cry and you have to let them until they fall asleep.

, You can't play with the child just yet, but they do get bored like we do. Try taking them for a walk to the park once a day, talking to them, putting pictures in the room where they spend most of their time, listening to music, or taking them in the car. Remember that your baby is just a baby and is not ready for rough play; do not roughhouse or shake your baby and be as gentle as possible instead.


In the beginning, the most important thing you can do is to bond with your baby. This means you should stroke your baby, cradle your baby, give the baby some skin-to-skin contact, or even consider giving your baby an infant massage.
Babies love vocal sounds, and it's never too early to start talking, babbling, singing, or cooing with your baby. Play some music for the baby while you're bonding, or play with toys that make noise, such as rattles or mobiles.
Some babies are more sensitive to touch and light than others, so if your baby doesn't seem to be responding well to your attempts at bonding, then you can take it easier with the noise and lights until your baby gets used to it.

, Your baby will pay frequent visits to the doctor during its first year, for scheduled check-ups and shots. Many first newborn visits occur just 1-3 days after you and your baby are discharged from the hospital. After that, each doctor's program will vary slightly, but you should generally take your newborn to the doctor at least two weeks to a month after birth, after the second month, and then every other month or so. It's important to schedule regular visits with your baby to make sure that your baby is growing normally and receiving the necessary care.It's also important to pay a visit to your doctor in case you notice anything abnormal; even if you're not sure that what is happening is abnormal, you should always call the doctor's office to check.
Some symptoms you should look out for include:

Dehydration: less than three wet diapers per day, excessive sleepiness, dry mouth
Bowel movement problems: no movement during the first two days, white mucus in stool, flecks or streaks of red in the stool, overly high or low temperature
Respiratory problems: grunting, flaring of nostrils, fast or noisy breathing, chest retractions
Umbilical cord stump problems: pus, odor, or bleeding from stump
Jaundice: yellow color in the chest, body, or eyes
Prolonged crying: crying for over thirty minutes
Other illness: persistent coughing, diarrhea, paleness, forceful vomiting for more than two consecutive feedings, fewer feedings than 6 per day



, You'll need to be prepared to take your baby on car rides before the baby is born since you'll need a way to get the baby home from the hospital. You'll need to get a car seat that is appropriate for newborns and to make sure that it is secure and safe for your baby. Though you may not need to spend a lot of time in the car with your newborn, some mothers find that taking the baby for a ride can actually help put him or her to sleep.


You should also get an infant seat for your baby. These seats are there to help your young baby sit up, not to help your baby be secured in a car. In this kind of seat, the base should have nonskid surfacing and should be wider than the seat, and it should have a secure locking mechanism, along with washable fabric. Never place your baby in the seat on an elevated surface that the baby can fall from.
As for child safety seats, make sure the seat meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety standard 213 and that it actually fits your child. Infants and toddles should sit in a rear-facing seat until they are at least 2 years old.

, If you're raising a baby solo, then you will need as much mental and emotional strength as possible. If you're lucky enough to have a spouse or a caring parent or parent-in-law, then it's important to arrange for some extra help to be there when your baby is born. If you can hire a nurse, great, but if not, just see if you can get some extra help, preferably from people who know what they're doing.


Even if your baby spends most of his time sleeping, you will be feeling a bit overwhelmed, and the more help you have, the more confident you'll feel about handling your baby.

, You need a good support system for your family and you. It may be a husband, boyfriend, or your own mom and dad. You need someone always there for you and your child throughout their childhood. If you're trying to raise your baby completely alone, you will be likely to run into trouble or to feel exhausted.


That being said, you should also establish visiting hours and rules. Having too many friends and family members show up for unexpected visits to see the baby can actually lead to more stress.

, Though it's important that you be there to take care of your baby, this does not mean that you should neglect caring for yourself. Make sure to bathe regularly, maintain a healthy diet, and to get as much sleep as you can. You and your spouse can work out a system where both of you have at least some time to take care of yourself. While this probably won't be the time for you to take up a new hobby or to start writing a memoir, you should make sure to get some exercise, see your friends at least a little bit, and just to have some ""me time"" when you can get it.
Don't think that you're being selfish by wanting a bit of time to yourself after your baby has just been born. If you take even a little bit of time to take care of yourself, you'll be a better caretaker for your baby.
Be easy on yourself. This is not the time to clean the whole house or lose 10 pounds.

, Anything can happen, especially during the first month of your baby's life. Make sure you haven't made too many plans and that you're prepared to give your baby the time it needs. Eliminate your stress in advance by letting people know that you'll be very busy with your baby, and don't force yourself to socialize too much or to make appearances with your baby unless that's something you really want.


Though you should give your baby the time it needs, that doesn't mean you should be holed up in your house with your baby. Get out of the house as much as you can -- it'll be better for you and your baby. , Even if you feel that one day with your newborn baby is 100 hours long, you'll soon see that your baby will be over the newborn stage before you know it (people debate whether babies stop being newborns after 28 days or up to 3 months). So, be prepared for all of the emotions you will feel: intense joy at seeing your baby, a fear that you may not be doing everything right, a panic that you have lost your independence, an isolation from your childless friends. All of these feelings are perfectly natural, and any hesitations or fears you have will fade to the background as you embark on a new life with your baby.

Make “Back Is Best” your sleeping priority.,
Give your baby regular “tummy time.” Place your infant on his belly on a firm surface for periods of ten to fifteen minutes (if possible) at least three times per day.,
Hold your newborn often, especially in an upright position.,
Vary your baby's activities throughout the day.",How to Prevent Infant Flat Head1," The possibility of a flat spot on the back of your baby’s skull is insignificant compared to your opportunity to greatly reduce the threat of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a terrifying condition in which a child under age one dies in his or her sleep for no determinable reason.Always place your infant to sleep on her back, on a firm mattress in an unoccupied, approved crib, with no pillows, blankets, toys, or loose clothing on or near the baby. Pacifiers are acceptable and may even be helpful in preventing SIDS.
The American Academy of Pediatrics’ “Back Is Best” campaign helped reduce SIDS deaths by 40%, but unintentionally caused rates of infant flat head to grow as well.;
, Supervise the baby closely at all times. Never leave the room.""Tummy time"" not only helps prevent flat head, it aids in motor development. It helps babies to strengthen their neck, arm and shoulder muscles.
The AAP has in fact changed its slogan from “Back Is Best” to “Stomach to Play and Back to Sleep” to indicate the importance of “tummy time” to infant development., The more time a baby spends out of the crib, infant seat, and swing, the less pressure is applied to the baby's head.The goal is not only to prevent pressure on the back of the skull, but to give the baby a range of movement that permits development of the neck and shoulder muscles as well.
Infant carriers that strap onto your chest and hold the baby upright while permitting range of motion can be a good choice.Holding your baby often also offers important bonding opportunities.

, Don't leave your baby in the same position or location for long stretches of time. Overuse of swings, infant seats, and bouncers can result in flat spots.Though a tempting option, car carriers, swings, and the like should not be used as long-term holding areas nor sleeping quarters for your infant, because they limit range of motion of the head and neck.Moving your baby around to new locations and new positions frequently also engages her senses, which is essential to infant development.

"
"
Avoid pillows, cushions, wedges, and the like.,
Alternate your baby's orientation within the crib.,
Rearrange your baby's sleeping quarters occasionally.,
Switch arms every time you feed your baby.,
Check with your pediatrician if your newborn develops flat head, or if his ears, eyes, or forehead look uneven.",How to Prevent Infant Flat Head2," It can be tempting to think that adding cushioning behind baby’s head will prevent a flat spot, but the risks outweigh any potential benefits.

Items like pillows introduce a smothering hazard and can increase the possibility of SIDS.Additionally, pillows, cushions, wedges, etc., make head movement more difficult, thereby limiting muscle development in the head and neck area.Babies should always sleep flat on their backs on a fairly firm surface, and if they are being temporarily propped up on a pillow or similar item while awake, must be constantly supervised.

, Have your baby's head face the foot of the bed one day, and reverse position the next. This encourages your baby to look in different directions.


This can help if your baby tends to tilt his head to one side or the other while sleeping to look toward a window, for instance. Some babies develop flat spots on one side or the other because they stare out in the same direction all the time.Changing the view by repositioning within the crib also increases visual stimulation.

, In addition to moving baby around within the crib, you can change up the surrounding view from time to time. Anything that helps keep her interested in looking around will help prevent flat spots and promote eye and muscle development.


Try putting the crib in another area of the room to give the baby a new viewpoint. This can keep the infant from regularly looking in the same direction.Relocate mobiles or other sources of visual stimulation as well. Make sure they are always properly installed and not in danger of falling or being pulled down into the crib, however., This will occur naturally if you are breastfeeding, but do the same if you use a bottle as well.


Switching sides regularly keeps pressure on the back of the head from occurring in the same spot all the time.Switching sides also aids in the equal visual development of both eyes, as each eye will have a turn with the dominant view of the surrounding area.

, While in most cases this is plagiocephaly, some head shape deformities are caused by craniosynostosis, which is a serious condition that requires surgery.If your child is diagnosed with positional plagiocephaly, your doctor may advise taking the above steps and waiting to see if the condition improves. Most flat spots do become rounded in time.
Regular physical therapy is also an option.
More serious cases may require remolding of the skull using a custom-made corrective helmet or band.

Taking parenting classes can help you learn what you’ll need to know and do as you prepare for the arrival of a newborn. Most classes cover changing diapers, bathing, burping, and feeding your baby, among other skills.For a unique bonding experience, attend these classes with your partner.;
, Books that offer advice to expectant parents (and, especially, books targeted specifically towards men) can offer valuable insights and information. Many of these books are available at your local library, though you could of course buy them, too., When your partner goes to the doctor for checkups and ultrasounds, tag along. Listen to the doctor’s advice. Write down information about what the birth process will entail and how you can prepare for the newborn’s arrival., Talk to your partner about where they want you to be during labor. Some expectant mothers want their partners in the birthing room during labor. Others expect their partner to remain outside. There is no right way for a couple to plan this experience, but you should discuss the options together and come to an agreement.If you’re invited into the birthing room, you’ll probably just be there to squeeze your partner’s hand and offer moral support.

You may ask yourself questions like “Am I up to this?” or “Will I hurt my baby?” and it’s important to realize that these are very normal feelings.Remember that there is no instruction manual for parenting and you’ll figure things out as you go.Ask your family members, friends, and doctor any questions you have about preparing for your baby.;
, If you are expecting your first baby or just want a refresher on how to care for a new baby, sign up for a class at your local hospital or healthcare facility.A class can answer questions you have and reassure you on things like:


Holding a new baby.
Bathing your baby.
Putting clothes on your baby.
Swaddling your baby.
Feeding and burping.
Cleaning the umbilical cord.
Caring for a circumcision.
Clearing nasal passages with a bulb syringe.
Recognizing health concerns including taking a newborn’s temperature.
Soothing your baby., Your obstetrician will check your baby’s health immediately following her birth, but your child will also need a pediatrician to observe her health and well-being as she grows.You can find a pediatrician by asking your doctor, family, or friends for recommendations.Most pediatricians offer a free visit before the baby is born to see if the doctor is a match for you. You can ask plenty of questions at this visit also. Other questions you may want to ask potential pediatrician’s offices are:


Are you accepting new patients?
Do you accept my insurance?
What are your office hours?
May I call with routine questions?
How does your office handle billing and insurance?, Remember that a new baby is joining a family, which can cause the dynamic in your home to change considerably.Let the baby’s siblings, your family, and friends know that you are expecting a new baby. This can help them prepare mentally for changes and offer you assistance during your pregnancy and after delivery.Send out pregnancy announcements if you like.
Tell the baby’s siblings in person. If your other children are small, explain what having a new baby means. For example, “there is a baby growing in my belly that will be here with us soon. It’ll be exciting because you’ll be a big sister and can help me out and love your new baby.”
Explain that a baby sleeps, eats, and cries a lot and won’t be able to play right away., No matter the size of your home—an apartment or house—your baby will need a place to sleep. You’ll also need a place to store baby supplies such as diapers and clothes.Avoid worrying about the size of the space. Babies don’t take up a huge amount of space their first few months of life.
Paint a separate room as a nursery or put up wall decals in the room or a space in an apartment.You can decorate with a gender-specific theme if you want, too.
Remember to use non-toxic paint if you decide to use color in the room.
Make sure the space has enough room for the bed you plan to use such as a bassinet, crib, or basket.
Set aside some space in your kitchen or pantry for bottles and formula if you are using it.

, There are certain items you will definitely need in order to welcome your new baby home. You can purchase most items new or even at second hand stores. Having these ready before you give birth can help ensure that you have an easier and more relaxed transition to parenthood.Some of the items that you should definitely have are:


A federally-approved car seat.
Crib, bassinet, or cradle with slats that are no more than 2 3/8 inches apart that meets current safety standards.
Bedding such as a mattress and fitted sheets.
Bottles, nipples, and bottle cleaners.
Changing table or non-slip pad.

, Most states will not let you leave the hospital with your newborn if you do not know how to use a federally-approved car seat.Before your baby’s birth, get used to placing the removing the seat from your car so that you can go home without any delay and be assured your baby is safe in her seat.Follow LATCH when installing the seat. LATCH stands for “lower anchors and tethers for children.” It means attaching the seat’s anchors and tethers to the metal latches or hooks in the back of your car.Read the instruction manual of your car seat before you start installing it. This can help ensure proper installation.Many hospitals or local police or fire departments will also check your car seat to make sure it's installed properly.
Make sure the car seat is in the back seat facing backwards., Before you bring your baby home, you’ll want to make sure her space and anything that touches her delicate skin is clean. In the weeks before your due date and/ or as you set up her room, wash anything that may come in contact with baby’s skin.Use a gentle, baby-friendly detergent that is free of dyes and scents that may irritate skin.Avoid fabric softener and dryer sheets as these can also irritate her skin., In the weeks before your due date, put together a bag of what items you may need in the hospital for yourself and your baby. Some things to include are:


A copy of your birth plan.
Entertainment or soothing music.
Comfortable clothing and footwear.
Personal items such as pillows and bathing articles.Diapers.
Clothing for your baby.
Camera.
Important documents such as insurance cards and driver’s licenses., Although this may not be immediately necessary, your baby will grow quickly and get increasingly curious. Secure areas of your home that could potentially harm your baby, such as sharp corners or electrical outlets, before she becomes mobile to avoid possible accidents.


Remember that no device is completely babyproof.Install safety latches and locks for cabinets and drawers in kitchens, bathrooms, and any other areas in your home. This can keep babies from gaining access to harmful items such as poisons, medications, and sharp objects.Use safety gates in areas where your child could encounter dangers, such as the stairs.Place doorknob covers and locks on entrances to rooms you don’t want your baby to enter.Install anti-scalding devices on faucets and shower heads and set the water temperature to 120 degrees to prevent burns.Use window guards and safety netting to minimize the risk of falls from windows or balconies.Make sure each floor of your home has smoke detectors., Having a baby changes the lives of individuals, couples, and families in significant ways. By discussing and embracing the inevitable changes about to happen, you can avoid misunderstandings and potential problems in your relationship.Be aware that women are biologically inclined on nurturing their baby during the first few months of life. Keeping this in mind along with inherent changes can help your husband, partner, children or other family members prepare themselves in advance of the baby’s birth.For example, many women have little or no interest in sex after giving birth and may not even want to have sex while they’re pregnant. But it’s important to understand that men don’t experience this change in feelings. Discussing issues such as this before birth or as it happens can help you deal with any frustrations and keep your relationship strong., There is variety of information available to help you get ready for your child. Ask for information from your doctor, family, and friends. You can also consult books and websites to help you navigate your pregnancy as a couple and family.


Ask for tips and resources that can provide valuable information during and after pregnancy.
Consult sources that detail the changes in your body during pregnancy so that you and your husband or partner can understand the changes you’re both experiencing.

, A baby is likely to thrive when their parents have a healthy relationship. Working on and keeping your relationship strong and healthy throughout your pregnancy and after birth helps you prepare and care for your baby.Discuss all matters related to your baby and relationship including expectations, family values and how you would like to raise your children. Even if you cannot agree on every matter completely, find compromises that may prevent problems in your relationship.Schedule plenty of couple time. Go for walks, have date nights, or take vacations to strengthen your bond as a couple., Babies incur a lot of expense and also require significant time and attention. Discussing your finances and how you’ll split the considerable workload can prevent miscommunications and problems during and after your pregnancy.Make sure to talk about the workload during your late stages of your pregnancy, when it can get difficult to move.
Figure out how you will tackle household work with a newborn, which may prevent couples from having resentful feelings towards one another.
Discuss your respective career plans, such as when and if mom wants to return to work. As a part of this conversation, discuss your feelings on child care and if this is a financially viable option or if it may be cheaper for one parent to either quit their jobs or switch to a job that allows them to work at home.

, Make sure to keep your partner an active part of your baby preparations. This can be key to maintaining your relationship and may help them more easily bond with your baby. Go to doctor’s appointments and purchase baby gear together to enjoy your baby preparations more fully.

, Remember that just as a new baby can change your relationship to your partner, it also makes for a new dynamic with any other children you have.Keeping older siblings in the loop throughout your pregnancy and letting them help once the baby is born can help prepare them for the changes they’ll soon experience.Let your child know as much about your pregnancy as you want.Smaller children may have trouble grasping time and the concept of a new sibling. You can say, “we’ll have a new baby in the house about the time Santa comes.”Allow your child to feel the baby kick if you are comfortable with that. Explain that it’s your child’s sibling saying hello or getting some exercise in your belly.You can also take your child to a doctor’s appointment to see the baby on a sonogram or hear the heartbeat.Encourage your child to help you with preparations like packing your hospital bag, thinking of a baby name, and helping to put together the nursery.Allow your child to “help” with the baby if she shows interest. Even though it may take longer, it’s a way to create a positive relationship between the siblings. In addition, don’t be alarmed if your child shows no interest in the baby. She’ll eventually get used to the new addition."

If you feel uncomfortable taking on an active role, tell your partner as far ahead as possible so that other arrangements can be made., After babies are born, it is common for one parent to become the primary caregiver for at least a few years. Talk to your partner about which of you will be staying at home with the child and which of you will be the family’s breadwinner. There is no right or wrong way to make this decision, but usually, whoever earns the most continues to work while the other parent cares for the child.Additionally, discuss other responsibilities like who will do the wash, make dinner, get up in the night to feed the baby, and so on.

, If you and your partner both decide to head back to work after your newborn arrives, discuss who will care for your child during the day.

Wait for it to go away.,
Wash your baby’s face.,
Treat with a topical cream.",How to Treat Your Newborn's Acne1," Baby acne is a common condition. Though they don’t know why it occurs, experts believe it is linked to the mother’s hormones.

If your baby has acne, you should choose skin products that are gentle. Look for products made specifically for babies with no fragrances, or designed for sensitive skin.

Generally, the acne will be on the cheeks, forehead, chin, or nose. However, your baby may be afflicted by other skin conditions. If the acne is not gone within six months, it is all over the body, or is purple in color, it may not be baby acne but a more serious condition.Other skin conditions like eczema or rashes may need a doctor's care.

",How to Know What to Expect on a Newborn's Skin," At birth, a newborn’s skin may be reddish or pinkish.However, the baby’s hands and feet may be bluish (acrocyanosis) because blood and oxygen are not yet circulating fully to the extremities.As the newborn’s circulatory system opens, this bluish color will subside.


If your newborn’s skin is bluish all over (cyanosis), however, let your physician know right away.If your skin is dark, you can expect that your newborn’s will be lighter than yours at first.Newborns with fair skin may show some mottling, with blotches of reddish and whitish skin.;
, There may be pink patches over a newborn's eye or in the middle of his or her forehead.These are called naevus simplex, commonly known as “angel kisses” or “salmon patches.” Usually, these fade within a few months, although they may be faintly visible afterwards.


Occasionally, a similar patch may be visible on the nape of a newborn’s neck. This is often called a “stork bite” and will also fade or become less noticeable in time.

, Because birth can be a physically demanding experience for both mother and baby, a newborn may have some bruising. This may show as patches of blue or other colors on the baby’s skin at various places. This is not usually a cause for concern, however. Your physician will examine your newborn, including any bruising (if present), and make sure that he or she is ok.

, At birth, a newborn’s skin may appear smooth and slightly puffy. There may also be noticeable swelling.Some amount of puffiness, especially on an infant's head or eyes (called edema) is not uncommon and will go away.However, let your physician know if you notice increased swelling after birth, especially in a particular area, such as the newborn’s feet or hands., 24-36 hours after birth, a newborn’s skin may still be pinkish, but it may also begin to look flaky.There may be some skin peeling (most common in the hands and feet); normally, it will go away without issue.


Your infant’s skin may still turn reddish when he or she cries, and turn slightly bluish or spotted if he or she becomes cold., A newborn’s skin may be covered in vernix caseosa, a white, cheesy substance. This may be present only at skin folds, such as on the legs.This protects the infant’s skin from amniotic fluid when in the womb, and will wash off during his or her first bath.Since the vernix caseosa washes away, you may not notice it for very long, if at all.

, This is caused by the mother’s hormones that were passed to infant. The condition is harmless, and will clear on its own., Many infants will show “cradle cap” (Seborrheic dermatitis) at some point. The skin on top of the infant’s head will appear dry, flaky, and perhaps oily.Cradle cap is harmless and it will typically go away by the time an infant is one year old. You can care for cradle cap at home:Rub the skin of your baby’s head with baby oil, mineral oil, or petroleum jelly an hour before shampooing. This will help to loosen dry and dead skin flakes.
Wet the baby’s scalp before shampooing, and brush gently with a soft-bristle brush. This well help to remove cradle cap scales.
Wash and rinse your baby’s scalp, then gently dry it with a towel.

, A newborn’s skin may be covered in fine body hair called lanugo. This most commonly shows on the shoulders, back, and sacral area (at the bottom of the spine).This is usually associated with premature infants, but can be present on any.Lanugo will disappear in the infant’s first few weeks of life.

, Plugged pores in the skin of an infant (usually the nose, chin, and cheeks) are called milia.These spots may appear similar to small whiteheads; however, they should not be confused with common “baby acne.” Milia is a common condition, appearing in about 40% of newborns, and will disappear on its own.

, These are purple-black or blue-black patches that may show up (often near the lower back) on infants of African-American or Asian descent.Mongolian spots are harmless and will disappear in time, typically within a year, though longer in some cases., This is a rash that may appear 1-2 days after a newborn’s birth. It looks like small yellowish spots surrounded by larger red patches. Though it may look alarming, Erythema toxicum is harmless.It should disappear within a week., This condition causes a newborn to be red on one side and pale on the other.It may occur when the newborn lies on his or her side, and it happens because the newborn’s circulatory and related systems are still developing.The coloring may develop suddenly, but usually goes away soon (within twenty minutes), after the infant is active or cries.


Harlequin coloring is most common within the first three weeks of a newborn’s life.

, An infant’s bottom or genitals may become red and sore, causing discomfort and irritability. However, the condition can be easily treated at home. Usually, diaper rash will be avoided or disappear within twenty-four hours if:Diapers are changed frequently
The infant’s skin is washed carefully
A non-prescription diaper ointment is applied at diaper changes

, This condition, called jaundice, is common in infants and is not usually associated with a disease or problem. It may cause yellowing of the skin, or orange or greenish in some cases.It may show up 24 hours after birth and peak at about 72 hours. It appears because an infant builds up a substance called bilirubin, and can have a number of causes ranging from not getting enough breast milk to the newborn having an immature liver.Usually, jaundice will clear on its own within a few days, but frequent feeding (every 2-3 hours) and a phototherapy treatment are also be recommended:


Phototherapy treatments expose the infant to light, which helps to eliminate bilirubin. Your physician will explain what phototherapy to use, if one is deemed necessary.

, Light tan spots (sometimes called café-au-lait spots) may appear at birth or develop in a child’s first few years.If many of these spots (or especially large ones) are present, your doctor will monitor your child, since they may be a sign of a condition called neurofibromatosis.

, There may be moles present on your newborn, called congenital nevi.These can vary in size: they may be as small as a pea, or large enough to cover an entire limb. Your doctor will inspect and monitor nevi, since large ones have a greater risk of becoming skin cancer.

, Port wine stains (large purple-red patches) are often harmless, but could be a symptom of an underlying issue such as Sturge-Weber syndrome or Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome., Fat necrosis is a movable lump underneath the surface that appears on some infants. Though fat necrosis is often benign and will go away on its own within a few weeks, your doctor will want to examine the lump to make sure that it is not related to another condition (such as renal disease or hypercalcemia)., If your newborn’s skin is bluish all over (cyanosis), let your physician know right away.This could indicate that your newborn’s blood is not circulating properly, or be a sign of a heart problem.,"

Pick up a newborn.,
Cradle the newborn.,
Hold the newborn on your shoulder.,
Use a baby sling or carrier.,
Be gentle.",How to Handle a Newborn Baby1," Always wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before you handle a newborn. A newborn's immune system is not strong yet, and you do not want to pass on any germs or infections. If you have visitors or guests, make sure they wash their hands before handling the newborn.Keep hand sanitizer in rooms where you typically hold the baby. This way it is convenient for you and any guests to clean their hands.;
, Slide one hand under the baby's head and place your other hand under the bottom. Scoop and bring the baby close to your body.It is important that you always support the head and neck because newborns do not have strong neck muscles.If you are picking up the baby from a crib, stroller, or bed, bend at your knees and not your waist. You want to protect your back.If you are lifting the newborn from the ground, get down on one knee and bring the infant close to your body before you stand up.
Avoid twisting your back when you pick up the baby as well. Pivot with your feet instead.

, Cradling is an intimate way to hold a newborn that allows you to interact with the baby. Rest the baby's head on your chest, and slide your hand from the bottom to support the neck. Move the baby's head to the crook of your arm to support the neck. Once the baby is securely in the crook of your arm, place your other hand under the baby's bottom.Don't forget to continually support the baby's head and neck as you position the baby.
It may be better to sit and hold the baby instead of standing up until you are more comfortable.

, Rest the newborn on your shoulder and use your hand to support the head and neck. Place your other hand on the baby's bottom. Try to allow the baby to see over your shoulder. The baby will enjoy the view.Be sure you have a good hold if you are walking up or down the stairs with the newborn on your shoulder.

, Baby slings and carriers are safe for newborns and allow you to use your hands while toting the baby. Always read the instructions and check the weight minimum before you use it. Your baby's face should never be covered by the sling or your body. If you can see your baby's face, you should be fine.Always bend at the knees when carrying your baby in one of these.
Make sure the carrier fits firmly around your waist and shoulders., A newborn is not ready for any type of rough play. Do not shake, bounce on your knee, or throw the baby in the air. If your newborn is in a carrier, sling, stroller, or car seat, try to limit excessive bouncing or anything rough.Shaking can cause brain bleeding and even death.You can always tickle the bottom of the newborn's feet or blow on her cheek.

Talk to your newborn.,
Swaddle your newborn.,
Learn the baby's cries.,
Try the five S's.,
Take a break.,
Recognize colic.",How to Handle a Newborn Baby2," Infants enjoy sound. Talk to, read, and sing to your newborn. You can also use baby rattles and musical mobiles with a newborn. If the newborn seems a little fussy, you may sing, read a nursery rhyme, or talk while you hold and rock the baby.If the newborn turns away, cries, or seems startled by talking or singing, your baby may be sensitive to noise. Lower the volume or use a softer tone to see if this helps.

, Swaddling keeps a baby warm and makes the baby feel safe and secure.Spread out a large blanket and fold one corner. Place the baby face up with the head at the edge of the folded corner. Bring one side of the blanket across the body and tuck it underneath the baby. Fold the bottom portion of the blanket to cover the baby's feet. Hold the baby in place and bring the other side of the blanket across the baby and tuck it.Only the head and neck should be visible once you are finished.
Swaddling is only recommended for babies under two months old.
Do not fold the blanket too tight. Babies should have room to move their feet, hips, and knees. Folding the baby too tight can cause breathing problems and hip development issues.
If you are swaddling to help your baby fall asleep, only place your baby on his back.

, This will be hard at first, but a newborn is crying to communicate a need. As time goes on you will know the difference between each cry. Common reasons a newborn will cry include:Sleepy or tired
Hungry
Gas
Too much noise or activity
Sick or in pain
Needs a diaper change

, If you newborn is crying and you cannot figure out why, go through the five S's to comfort your baby. These activities mimic the womb environment and will help calm the baby.Swaddle
Side or stomach position — hold the baby on the side or stomach. Remember to always put your baby on or her back when it is time for bed.
Shush — Drown out some other noises by running the vacuum cleaner, hair dryer, fan, or clothes dryer.
Swing — Rock the baby or take your baby for a car or stroller ride.
Suck — Have the baby suck on a pacifier.

, If your baby is crying and you begin to feel frustrated, take a timeout and then try to soothe the baby again. Your baby can pick up on your emotions and will respond. If you are upset, your baby may be upset as well.


Place the baby down in the crib or bassinet and walk around the house for a few minutes.
If you can, leave the baby with someone else so you can get a break.
You can also count to 10 and take a few deep breaths. Tell yourself, ""Everything will be alright,"" or ""I can do this.""

, If your baby cries for more than three hours a day for more than three days a week, the baby may have colic. All your attempts to soothe the baby will seem unsuccessful. Colic usually ends when the baby is around 12–14 weeks old. Colic usually stops on its own, but take your baby to the pediatrician if you are concerned.Be as patient as possible and continue to soothe your newborn.
Try to get help from a partner, family, or friends during this time.

Recognize signs of hunger.,
Feed the newborn frequently.,
Burp the baby.",How to Handle a Newborn Baby3," If your baby is stirring, stretching, or making sucking motions, your baby is showing early signs of hunger. Crying and fussing are later signs that the newborn is hungry. Try to start feeding as soon as you recognize that the baby is hungry. This will keep you from having to spend so much time soothing the baby.


The baby will let you know when it's time to eat. Listen to your baby and feed when he or she wants to eat.If your baby sleeps for more than three or four hours, wake them to eat during the first few weeks. After this, it is okay to let your baby sleep longer.If your baby stops sucking, turns away from the food, or closes his or her mouth, the baby may be full. Burp the baby and wait a few minutes to be sure.

, Newborns eat eight to 12 times a day. This is about one feeding every two or three hours. Only feed the newborn breast milk or formula. If you are using formula, your baby may only eat every three to four hours. A newborn does not need water or juice.The amount of food your newborn needs varies with each baby; however, most newborn babies take about 1–3 oz per feeding. Trust your gut and look for signs that your infant is eating enough such as:Weight gain
Appearing satisfied in between feedings
At least six wet diapers and three bowel movements each day (after the first five days)
Feeding is also another time for you to bond with your baby. Don't forget to talk to, make eye contact with, and rub your baby during this time., After a few ounces, or while switching breasts, hold the baby over your shoulder and gently pat or rub the back until you hear the baby burp. You can also place the baby in your lap, use your hand to support the chest, support the cheek bones with your thumb and finger. Lean the baby slightly forward and wait for the baby to burp.


Your baby may not burp every time, but burping keeps your baby from eating too fast and helps reduce gas.Burp her after feeding as well.

Know normal sleeping habits.,
Place a newborns on his back.,
Keep the crib or bassinet clear.,
Establish a bedtime routine.",How to Handle a Newborn Baby4," Newborns typically sleep 16–18 hours a day. They usually wake up every two to three hours to eat. The length of time your baby sleeps each time will vary. Some babies will start to sleep five to six hours a night around two months of age.Learn what is normal for your baby.
Newborns do not know the difference between night and day so be prepared to run on very little sleep.

, A newborn baby should only sleep on his back. Do not place him on his side or stomach to sleep. Stomach sleeping can lead to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Stomach sleeping can block the baby's airway and cause the baby to get too hot.

, The bottom sheet should fit tightly. Keep items such as pillows, blankets, and toys out of the crib or bassinet. Anything loose in the crib is a hazard and could suffocate your baby. Also be sure that there are no items that can get caught around the baby's neck such as ribbons, cords, or ties.Any crib you use should meet current safety standards.
Consider putting your baby in a sleep sack since a loose blanket is dangerous.

, Although your newborn may be too young to understand a bedtime routine, starting one now may be helpful in the future. Routines may include bathing, reading, and singing. Keep the lights low and create a calm environment.You can rock and cuddle with your baby to encourage sleep.
The room should be at a comfortable temperature.

Pack the appropriate number of diapers.,
Include a pack or two of baby wipes.,
Consider including a changing pad.,
Pack everything necessary for breast or bottle feeding.,
Include a spare change of baby clothes.,
Add some pacifiers and burp clothes or bibs.,

Include any personal items.,
Pack efficiently and effectively.,
Ensure that your diaper bag is fully stocked.,
Consider packing two diaper bags.,
Adapt the diaper bag to your baby’s needs.",How to Pack a Diaper Bag for a Newborn," Select the type of bag that will fit your needs. The bag must have plenty of compartments laid out in an organized manner so that you can store different items in it without needing to bring an extra bag.


Look for a bag with accessible pockets that you can keep the things you use often readily available. These pockets might be good for storing your own personal items in, like your wallet, keys, or phone.
Some bags may have added features like insulated bottle holders, or key clips for fast access to your keys.;
, The contents of the bag will most likely be relatively heavy, so making sure the material is as light as possible may help to keep you from straining under the weight of the bag.

, In emergency situations, you will need a bag that you can get into very quickly. Again, easy-access pockets are also useful in emergency situation. Depending on what you find to be the quickest to open, you will find bags that are sealed up either by:


Velcro.
Zipper.
Magnet.

, While you may be all about bargain shopping, a diaper bag is not something you want to gamble on; you need a sturdy bag where the handles won’t tear and the material won’t rip. Dealing with a broken zipper while holding a wailing baby is not a stress you need to face.


Do a little research and determine which company, and bag, seems to have the best reviews. You may even find a diaper bag with a warranty.
Try the bag out before actually buying it to make sure that it feels good, and that the quality of the material is on par with what you are looking for.

, Choose a bag with a material that can be cleaned easily. Some bags can be washed in the washing machine and some can be easily wiped off.

, As a general rule, try to bring at least one diaper for every two hours that you will be away from home.


In addition, pack plastic diaper bags so that you can properly dispose of soiled diapers.

, Baby wipes can make cleanup easier than having to find water to wash your baby with.


Look for baby wipes that come in resealable travel packages, as the container will be made of lighter material than that of the refillable plastic boxes meant for home use.

, Some diaper bags come with this item. Diaper pads are used to set your mind at ease that you are changing your baby on a clean surface. Simply lay the diaper pad down on whatever surface you plan to change your baby on.


If you do not have a changing pad, you can also bring an extra blanket to lay down and change your baby on. You may want to bring a plastic bag to put the blanket in if the changing gets messy.

, You should consider bringing an extra container of your child’s milk formula in case he or she is extra hungry during your outing.


Breastfeeding needs include: a lightweight nursing cover, nursing pads in case your breast gets filled up with milk to avoid leakage, and lanolin cream to ease cracked and bleeding nipples.

, Accidents happen and it is important to try to avoid carrying around a messy baby. Clothes that fold up easily and should be packed include:


A onesie jumpsuit, a sleeper, a hat, and a pair of socks.
You may also want to bring an extra pair of clothes for yourself in emergency situations.

, A pacifier is optional and for those who prefer to let their baby use it. If you do bring a pacifier, pick out one that has a cover on it so that it will not get dirty inside of the bag.


A burp cloth or bib is a small cloth which is tied around your baby’s neck and used to wipe your baby’s spit up after burping. You can bring at least two of these. These cloths can also be used to wipe your baby’s face.

, Your baby may start feeling unwell on your outing. In cases like this, it is important to have a first aid kit to make your baby feel better. Items to bring include:


Gas relief drops
Non-aspirin liquid pain reliever
Calamine lotion to relieve irritated or itchy skin
Diaper rash cream to avoid discomfort
Saline drops to loosen mucus
Petroleum jelly as lubricant
Antibacterial ointment for cuts or scrapes
Bandages

, This is used to check your baby’s temperature when you suspect that he or she has fever. If your baby’s oral temperature reaches 100.4 °F (38 °C), or she has a rectal or ear temperature above 101 °F (38.3 °C), then your baby has a fever., When you are shopping or traveling, it is nice to have something to distract your child with so you can get things done. Some infant toys include:


Rattles, soft toys like stuffed animals, and colorful picture books.

, Keep this in a book or folder. The records should include information about your child’s history of check-ups, vaccines, allergies (if any), and medications.

, Do not forget to bring the things that you will need. These items may include cell phone, wallet, and keys.

, Maximize the space in your diaper bag so you don’t feel like a pack mule with a very heavy load. Organize similar items, like clothing items, into Ziploc bags to keep things together and safe from any spills.


Pack the larger and less often used items at the bottom of the bag, such as the change of clothes or nursing cover. Put items that you might need to grab quickly, such as a pacifier or bottle to soothe the baby, towards the top.
Keep smaller items in outside pockets or grouped together in smaller bags.

, A general rule of thumb is to bring everything your baby would need if you were at home for the same period of time that you’ll be out.


From there, you can add more items you think your baby will need just in case. For example, if your newborn will drink a bottle while you are out, bring what he would normally drink plus a little extra.
Check for these items before every outing and replace them quickly when they run out.

, Some moms choose to have two diaper bags—a smaller bag that is easier to carry and that holds the essentials, like diapers, wipes, and toys. The smaller diaper bag comes with them into the stores and is the bag to leave the car when running errands.


They also keep a larger bag in the car or somewhere easily accessible that has all of the other items that you might need in an emergency.
Having two diaper bags is a personal preference and can be useful for some moms, but may make things more difficult for other moms.

, As your baby grows and you learn more about his needs and habits, you’ll be able to customize your diaper bag to meet his needs by adding or removing certain items. By being prepared and having the essentials in your diaper bag, you can be ready for anything no matter where you take your newborn.

Avoid any force.,

Let the pet sniff or be around the baby's belongings.,

Walk around the pet with the baby in your arms or keep a distance from the pet during play time, but don't engage in any direct contact yet.,
Use common sense and know when it's a right time to approach the pet while it's sleeping.,

Let time pass and keep observing the behavior of both the pet and baby when they're around each other.,

Sit down with the baby in your lap somewhere that the pet usually goes around or hangs out.",How to Help a Pet Get Used to a New Baby," This may scare away the pet if they're not used to new things or people or may have a negative reaction. If the pet is territorial about the baby being brought into the family, the bonding between the pet and baby will be more difficult and longer to attempt.
, If there's a blanket or toy around, don't shoo the pet away. The sniffing lets the pet adapt to the scent of the child and gives them their own opportunity to learn more about the baby in their own way., If the pet is still intimidated, stay away at a safe distance. Use a baby-soothing voice around the both of them. Ask the baby, ""Whose that?"" and ""Is that the ______ ?"" (depending what pet it is. Use ""child"" words, for example ""doggy"" or ""kitty"" instead of dog or cat. If you use a calm voice with the baby, he/she will develop a calm sense around the pet instead of being hyper., Don't let the baby touch the pet at this time, but let them observe with their eyes. This method will make the baby feel comfortable around the pet in a non-interaction way., Patience is the key:

If there is no difference, keep trying to introduce the two of them.
If there seems to be a negative reaction, it's best to keep the pet away from the child until the pet is confident and ready to be around babies and kids.
If there is a calm and positive environment between the two, encourage more interaction and playtime.

, Get the pet to interact with the baby by letting the animal sniff them and the baby to touch the pet's fur. Watch the baby's reactions and facial expressions to see if they enjoy it, especially if the pet starts to lick the baby's feet out of nowhere."

Make faces at each other.,
Be proactive about playing with your newborn.,
Speak to your newborn.,
Read out loud to them as well.,
Sing to your baby.,
Incorporate hand signs and touching into your play time generally.",How to Play With Your Newborn1," In terms of engagement and enjoyment, there’s nothing more enjoyable for your newborn than a good face-making session. In fact, newborns even prefer faces to toys. Further, your baby will be especially excited to observe wide-open eyes and genuine smiles. Look your baby in the eye and respond to any actions the baby makes by changing your expression. The sillier the better.Aside from the enjoyment your newborn will derive from making faces at one another, face-to-face interaction also helps lay the foundation for a bond that will help your relationship with your child in the years to come.;
, Know that you’ll need to initiate almost all interactions with your newborns for the first few months of their life. By three or fourth months old, however, your baby will begin expressing themselves with facial expressions, sounds, and movements.You’ll start by making dramatic facial expressions and noises, as these will be the first things your baby is able to recognize.
Progress into smiling and conveying verbal excitement when your baby begins to coo and gurgle in response to your expressions. Soon, they’ll by squealing and laughing in response to most of your statement and behaviors.

, Hold your face close to your newborn while speaking to them to get more face-to-face time together as well. Extremely young newborn babies may prefer the silly noises often associated with speaking to babies, but you can also simply speak softly using an actual human language. Not only will this be fun for your newborn, there are copious links between children’s language and intelligence development and the degree to which they were spoken to as a baby.Talk to your newborn while feeding, bathing, and changing them as well.
As your baby approaches three months of age, start describing the things around you as you carry them around. At this point, they will be developing the ability to visually focus and will begin to understand the association between language and objects. Though it sounds simple, this will be an immense source of enjoyment for your baby.

, It’s never too early to read your baby. You can even simply read whatever you’re reading out loud to them. As they become more aware of their surroundings, read them books that feature pictures with highly contrasting colors and basic illustrations.Exposure to your voice, the rhythm with which you speak and structure sentences, and the vocabulary you use will all steadily increase your baby’s understand of verbal communication.
Make sure to eliminate extraneous noise when reading to your baby. In particular, turn off any televisions or other devices emitting distracting audio.

, Your baby will be especially interested in listening if you’re singing. And even better: sing songs that incorporate a physically active component, and move their arms or playfully touch your newborn as you sing to them. Incorporate singing with hand-motions into your baby’s daily routine.Start with the classics, as you may even already know them: The Wheels on the Bus, The Itsy-Bisty Spider, and If You’re Happy and You Know It are proven mainstays.

, Moving your babies hands as you talk to them – or moving your own in front of or upon them – will encourage your newborn to develop both the physical skills necessary to move their arms, as well as the mental recognition that communication is occurring.One of the best ways to convey that you’re communicating with your baby is by imitating them. Make similar sounds, expressions, and movements as they are, to emulate the process of interacting with someone else.

Learn proper etiquette.,
Choose a software or website to help you design the cards.,
Design the cards yourself.,
Be creative.,
Make a decision on the type of paper.,
Get an estimate from a local print shop.,
Consider ordering the printed cards online.,
Think about doing electronic announcements.",How to Make and Print Birth Announcements," When it comes to birth announcements, certain rules should be followed. Know what information is customary to include before designing your announcements.


Include names. You should include the full names of both the baby's parents, any siblings, and the new baby itself.
The baby's height and weight are commonly included, although you do not have to share this if you do not feel comfortable.
Most birth announcements include the location of the birth.
The names of grandparents are also usually included in birth announcements.;
, If you're not a designer yourself, certain websites and softwares can help you design birth announcements. You'll be walked through templates and designs and allowed to cater existing announcements to your liking.


Certain websites, like Shutterfly and FedEx, allow you to create media using their online system. However, the downside is you have to print announcements through these companies if you use the software they provide to create media. Make sure the rates are within your budget.
There are a variety of software packets you can purchase for a fee that allow you to design things like birth announcements. You can find these softwares by asking other parents for recommendations, browsing catalogues online, and going to a local electronics stores and asking a clerk. Always read reviews of any products you purchase to make sure they're reputable and user friendly.

, If you have a background in graphic design or are simply skilled at DIY projects, consider designing the cards yourself. You can use software like Photoshop to create and customize your own designs. You can also make handmade announcements and use a color copying machine to upload them to a computer and subsequently print copies.]

, Birth announcements should be a fun expression of yourself and your new family member. Play with text, formatting, design, and photos. Have fun.


You'll need a picture of the newborn for the announcements. Some parents aren't comfortable sending out pictures to a lot of casual acquaintances and might feel more comfortable with a photo of the baby's face alone. Make a decision based on what you're most comfortable with.
Choose a font that's attractive, but readable. An overly stylistic font might be annoying for recipients to read. Try to pick something classy, but legible. Play around with font selection on your computer to find something that suits you.
Consider adding graphics in a creative manner. If your family's last name is, say, woods a faded backdrop of trees cute be a cute choice. If your baby has a nature name, incorporate that into the card. Baby Rose's birth announcement could be adorned with images of roses in the corners., You should choose a type of paper that's durable and won't cause colors or designs to blur. Take the following into consideration when selecting paper:


Consider the thickness and weight of the paper. Thicker, heavier papers tend to be pricey but they also may be less susceptible to damage during delivery.
The overall quality of the paper is important as well. You should select something higher quality than standard notepad paper, but something manuscript quality is likely overkill. Ask at a local print shop or do research online to see what quality papers are typically used for the color schemes and designs you chose.
Consider the color of the paper. If you have a lot of graphics and colors on your existing design, plain white is probably the best choice. However, if you have a less decorative announcement a cream or yellowish shade might be a nice touch., Figure out about how many cards you plan to send and get an estimate from a local print shop. While calling, explain the size of the cards, the type of paper you wish to use, the number you intend to print, and any other special considerations regarding your announcements. See how the estimate fits into your budget.

, If a print shop is too costly, consider getting the cards printed online and delivered to you. Companies like Shutterfly and FedEx allow you to design announcements and then order printed copies. You might also find local companies who allow you to do work online. It may be cheaper and quicker to print cards online, depending on the rates. It's not a bad idea to shop around and see what price is best for you.

, Electronic announcements are very convenient. They can also allow you to save money. However, there's etiquette involved when it comes to announcing a birth online.


Electronic announcements are easy to send in that you can do so through one mass email. You can include the same information as well as a similar design in an e-card as you would a regular card.You can also do a little of both. You can send one e-card after the baby's birth and then send individualized birth announcements to close family members and friends."

Spend some belly-down time on the floor together.,
Increase the amount of belly-down time as your newborn grows.,
Provide visual toys for your newborn.,
Dance with your newborn.",How to Play With Your Newborn2," Along with holding and talking to your newborn, facilitating some time spent on their bellies is the best way to spend time together. While many of the steps in this article can occur while your baby is on the floor – they will most often be on their back. Rolling your newborn onto their belly will help them begin to develop their motor skills, and will eventually contribute to their learning to roll around, push themselves up, sit, crawl, and otherwise ramble around.Check with your pediatrician if you feel uncomfortable placing your baby on their belly when they’re still itty-bitty. However, know that even day-old newborn babies can usually be safely rolled onto their bellies, after first being placed gently on their back.
However, many babies will not tolerate very much time (a few seconds or minutes) on their bellies because they don't yet have the neck strength to hold up their heads.
There are plenty of games you can play with your baby on their belly. Peek-a-boo is a classic; you may find yourself enjoying belly time just as much as your baby!

, Get in the habit of always rolling your baby onto their belly for a while after changing them or playing with them when they’re lying on their backs. Once your baby has control of their head, default towards placing them belly-down most of the times you set them on the floor. Start slowly and don’t rush it, but incorporate belly-down time into regular daily activities to get your newborn used to using the muscles they’ll need to start moving around and really start testing your playfulness.
However, don't leave your baby alone on their belly, and don't put your baby to sleep on their belly.

, Your baby’s visual capabilities will drastically change during the first few months of their lives. Dangle or suspend simple, safe toys designed for newborns about 8-12 inches from your baby’s face. If they reach for it, help them feel or bat at the toy.Choose toys that incorporate high contrast between colors – even simply black and white – as these will help babies begin to be able to tell colors apart.


Show your baby interesting visual things as well. For instance, tornado bottles, glittery items, and even lava lamps may totally mystify your newborn – though do not allow them to touch anything that is not designed for a newborn to hold.
Another benefit of dangling toys in front of your newborn is that it can help your baby begin to control their visual concentration and ability to track movement.

, Sure, they may not ever take the lead, but swaying back and forth with your newborn is delightfully playful and will greatly increase your bond with your baby. Swinging your baby gently through the air is not only especially likely to get them giggling, it will help increase their bodily awareness, which will help as they begin to learn how to control their own bodies as well.Make sure to support their neck and head until they can do so safely on their own.

Hold your baby often.,
Incorporate some skin time while holding your newborn.,
Remind them about their own bodies.,
Make different textures accessible.,
Take the baby on walk or jog.",How to Play With Your Newborn3," Make sure you hold your baby for a while several times every day. Holding them will increase their level of comfort in your arms, and will offer them the joys of movement, changing perspectives, and physical contact. Though simply holding your baby may not seem like ""play,"" you may be surprised by how much you end up laughing at one another and otherwise enjoying each other's company.Experiment holding you baby in different ways, including with the aid of a baby carrier that is safe and appropriate for the baby’s size.
Always make sure you’re supporting your newborn’s head, as neck muscles are still developing for the first six months.

, Contact between your own and your baby’s skin will also strengthen your bond to one another, increase both you and your baby’s level of happiness, and even help regulate your baby’s temperature and heart rate.Further, your skin will likely fascinate your baby. They will likely spend long periods of time simply looking at and touching your skin, as well as their own. This is both a type of exploratory playfulness you'll see whenever they touch something new or pleasurable.

, Don’t forget some of the best baby toys there are: their own hands and feet. As your newborn begins to notice their own hands and feet, they’ll be both amused and overjoyed. Facilitate this fascination by bringing their attention to different parts of their own body.As they become able to better control their hands, provide them with a rattle or something else that will make noise. Making noise with toys is often the manner by which babies first begin to learn that they are capable of affecting the world around them.
Similarly, provide them with toys they can touch together and compare as they begin to gain more control of their bodies.

, Your newborn will likely be fascinated by the different ways things feel to the touch. Provide a variety of toys and fabrics to your newborn to expose them to how vastly different things can feel. Similarly, make a point of laying them down on surfaces with different textures, including different types of blankets and cloth.Know that a baby first learns about their body and their environment with their tactile sensory system. Otherwise stated, they first learn by touching things. This is why many baby toys include little move-able attachments.

, Bringing your newborn on walks will be healthy and enjoyable for both of you. They will be thrilled by the new visual, auditory, and physical sensations. Further, exposure to the outdoor environment will help stimulate their intellectual growth, curiosity, and sense of place in the world as a human individual.


Bring your baby along for your jog to include them in your exercise routine.
Use a baby carrier if you’ll just be walking, as this will facilitate a greater personal bond, and close proximity to your body is a perfect source of warmth."

Wash your hands before you get started.,
Find a private location to perform the kangaroo care.,
Remove your infant’s clothing.,
Remove your own shirt.,
Hold the infant against your chest.,
Keep the infant in place for several hours each day.,
Breastfeed the infant.,
Take advantage of the benefits of kangaroo care.,
Confirm your infant’s medical stability.,
Avoid kangaroo care with excessively premature infants.,
Check hospital policy.",How to Give Kangaroo Care to Preemies," Before you hold an infant, it is important to wash your hands thoroughly. Take a minute to wash, rinse, and dry your hands before picking up the baby.
, As you’ll be holding your infant against your chest for several hours, you’ll want to find a relatively quiet, secluded, comfortable location for the kangaroo care.If you have a private room in the hospital, you could lay in the bed or sit in the chair while holding your infant.


If you’ve returned to your house, but your obstetrician suggests that you continue to administer kangaroo care, find a comfortable spot where you can remain relatively static for several hours.
For example, sit on the couch and read or watch a couple of movies, or hold your infant in bed while you rest.

, If your infant is wearing a hospital onesie, remove this—you can leave a diaper on the baby, however. It’s important that the infant have as much skin exposed as possible. The skin-to-skin aspect of kangaroo care is crucial.If you’re concerned about your infant’s temperature while you give a baby kangaroo care, ask the hospital staff for an infant-sized hat for the baby to wear.

, In order to facilitate skin-to-skin contact with your infant, you’ll need to remove your shirt as well. The hospital staff may also be able to accommodate you with a loose, front-opening blouse or shirt that you can contain your infant inside.If you’re in a more crowded area within a hospital, you may be able to hold your infant under your shirt without undressing. Be careful not to drop the child in this situation. For this purpose, it may be best to perform the kangaroo care sitting down.

, Fathers can hold the infant directly against their chest; mothers are advised to hold the child between their breasts. Women will probably need to remove their bra in order to do this, both to maximize skin-to-skin contact and to avoid squishing the infant under your bra. You should hold the infant upright against your chest, rather than cradling the baby in your arms or laying them across your body sideways.Holding the baby upright will maximize the skin-to-skin contact between you and the infant. If you cradle the baby sideways against your chest, the baby’s body may tilt away from yours and decrease the contact and warmth the baby receives.
Parents are encouraged to switch off: pass the infant to your partner when you need to use the restroom, take a walk, or eat a meal.

, Kangaroo care is not a technique that can be implemented for only a short period of time. You should intend to hold your baby for at least one hour, four or more times each week.Do not play with your baby at this time; simply let the baby rest on your chest.


The total number of days or weeks for which you’ll need to provide kangaroo care will vary based on how prematurely your infant was born, how quickly the baby gains weight, and whether or not the baby maintains its good health. Consult with your doctor for their estimate of how long you’ll need to maintain kangaroo care.
You can also place a blanket around yourself and the baby. This will further insulate the infant and keep them from cooling off, and will also keep you warm since you may not be wearing a shirt.
In some settings, it’s common for the parents of preemies to provide almost 24/7 kangaroo care., Mothers, if your infant is awake, hungry, and healthy enough to breastfeed, kangaroo care presents an excellent opportunity for breastfeeding. The infant’s closeness can naturally stimulate and increase the mother’s breast milk supply, and kangaroo care has been shown to lead to an increase in successful breastfeeding.Fathers can use this time to feed their infant using a bottle of pumped breast milk or formula milk.

, Not only will the skin contact that results from kangaroo care keep your infant warm, but it will provide other health benefits which will help the premature infant survive and thrive. Kangaroo care was initially used to decrease mortality rates among preemie babies, and can help preemies survive that might not otherwise live. Kangaroo care gives babies other health benefits, including:Stabilizing the infant’s heart rate.
Increasing the baby’s time spent sleeping and quality of sleep.
Regularizing the baby’s breathing patterns.
Increasing the infant’s brain development.
Increased breastfeeding.
Decreased crying.
This practice benefits the parent as well as the child. The copious physical contact increases the parents’ emotional connection and feelings of closeness with the baby., If, in addition to having been born prematurely, your preemie is sick or has serious medical concerns, the doctors may not allow you to hold the child or give them kangaroo care. Ask the doctors and staff members of the neonatal or neonatal intensive care unit if your infant is well enough for kangaroo care.Even if your infant is connected to various machines or monitors, you may still be able to provide kangaroo care.
However, depending on the state of your baby’s immune system, doctors may be concerned about the infant’s contact with foreign bacteria and discourage kangaroo care.

, If your infant was born extremely prematurely, they may not be sufficiently developed and may need to remain on life-support machines or in intensive medical care. If this is the case, do not try to give your infant kangaroo care. While kangaroo care may benefit the preemie later, medical care to guarantee the infant’s survival should be the first priority.To determine if your infant is overly premature and too delicate to be given kangaroo care, consult with your obstetrician or the staff of the neonatal care unit.

, For a variety of reasons, certain hospitals may have restrictions on when or how parents are able to provide kangaroo care to their premature infants. If hospitals are unfamiliar with kangaroo care, or that staff feels that they do not have resources to allow parents to safely practice kangaroo care, they may not allow it.Also consider the timing of your infant’s premature birth. Hospital staff may be most inclined to let parents provide kangaroo care for premature infants beginning at 28 or 30 weeks after conception.

Choose an appropriate guardrail.,
Remove one side of the crib.,
Remove the bedding.,
Attach the brackets to the rail.,
Position the rail.,
Fix the rail to the bed.,
Make the bed.",How to Turn a Crib Into a Toddler Bed1," Unless your child's crib came with its own toddler bed rail, you'll need to purchase a separate rail.









Toddler bed rails are lower and shorter than the sides of a crib. Your toddler should be able to get in and out of bed without assistance, but the rail should prevent your toddler from accidentally rolling out of bed in his or her sleep.
Typically, your best option will be a universal toddler guardrail kit. The rail itself should fit most recently manufactured cribs, and the kit will also contain the metal brackets and screws you'll need to attach the rail.;
, Use a manual or electric screwdriver to remove the screws holding one side of the crib in place. After removing the screws, you should be able to completely lift away the side.








The exact set-up will vary depending on the crib manufacturer and model, but typically, there will be several screws located along the left and right posts of the crib side.
In most cases, you'll only want to remove one side of the crib. If you choose to remove both sides, you'll need to install a toddler rail on either side or push one side of the bed against a wall.
Note that this will only work for convertible style cribs. Stationary cribs do not have removable sides, so you won't be able to use this method of conversion.

, You'll need access to the bottom slats of the bed when installing the guardrail, so remove the bedding and mattress from the crib before you begin.









Set the bedding aside. Since the dimensions of the bed won't change after you convert it, you should be able to use the same mattress and sheets.
It'll be easiest to complete this step after you've already removed one side of the crib, but if you need to access the bottom slats to remove the side, remove the mattress and bedding first.

, Position one L-bracket along the inside of each rail post. Attach the brackets to the posts using screws and a screwdriver.









Guardrail kits should come with the correct L-brackets and screws, but if you need to buy separate hardware, choose 2 inch (5 cm) or 3 inch (7.6 cm) corner brackets with four mounting holes and 1 inch (2.5 cm) long Phillips-head screws.
You'll need to install one bracket one each of the two guardrail posts.
Position the bracket so that the foot of the bracket lies flush with the bottom of the post. The vertical portion of the bracket should be aligned with the center of the post. Use two screws to secure the bracket to the post.

, Lift the guardrail and position it over the bare side of the bed. Hold the rail so that the end posts and attached brackets line up with two separate slats on the bottom of the bed.








Try to leave approximately 9 inches (23 cm) of space in between the rail and the headboard. You should also leave another 9 inches (23 cm) of space in between the rail and the footboard.
By leaving this much space on either side of the rail, you'll make it easier for your toddler to get in and out of bed.

, While holding the rail steady, install two screws through the remaining holes of each bracket and into the corresponding slat rolls at the bottom of the bed.









You must use two screws with each bracket. Try to keep the bracket positioned down the center of each corresponding slat for the greatest amount of security.
Make sure that the screws are tight and able to hold the brackets firmly in place. When finished, try to wiggle the rail. The guardrail should not move.

, Once the guardrail is in place, return the mattress to the bed. Cover it with sheets, blankets, and pillows as needed. The toddler bed should now be ready to use.









Note that if you need or want to install a second rail on the other side of the bed, you should do so by following the same steps used for the first rail. Install both rails before returning the mattress and bedding.

Remove the bedding.,
Adjust the height.,
Cut an opening in one of the sides.,
Cut down the leftover wood.,
Use two separate pieces of wood for the ladder sides.,
Cut notches into the side pieces.,
Fix the steps into both sides.,
Secure the ladder to the bed.,
Attach an L-bracket to the edge of the rail.,
Return the bedding.",How to Turn a Crib Into a Toddler Bed2," Take the mattress, sheets, and any other bedding out of the crib before you begin. You'll need direct access to all sides of the crib, including the bottom, and the bedding will only get in the way.









It's a good idea to set aside the mattress and bedding in a separate room. Sawdust and other particles may get into the bedding if you keep it nearby.

, If you're able to adjust the height of the crib sides and base, do so now. The height you choose will be the final height of the toddler bed.








To create a loft-style toddler bed, you should adjust the base and sides to their highest points. Note that you'll also need to create a ladder for your toddler to use if you opt for a loft-style bed.
To create a standard toddler bed that won't require the use of a ladder, adjust the base and sides to their lowest points.

, Use a saw to cut an opening into one of the long sides of the crib. Start at one end of the crib and remove roughly one-third of the total side length.








If you can remove the side completely, it might be in your best interest to do so before you trim it down to size. Otherwise, you'll need to work carefully to avoid damaging the remainder of the crib.
Trim the side so that the new edge lies flush with one of the remaining vertical slats. This slat will become the new side edge of the rail. If desired, you can also use a portion of the removed rail to finish off the new edge.
Secure the rail back onto the side of the bed if you removed it while trimming it down. Make sure that the rail is sturdy and unable to wiggle around before continuing.

, Use a saw to trim down the slats of the removed railing. The new length of these slats should roughly match the size of the opening you created in the side of the bed.









Note that this is only necessary if you plan to create a ladder for a loft-style toddler bed. These newly trimmed slats will form the rungs or steps of the ladder.
Make sure that the steps are large enough for your toddler to use. Each of the slats must also be equal in length.

, Cut a length of sturdy wood into two equal pieces. These pieces will form the sides of the ladder.









Use pallet wood or another type of sturdy wood for this. The wood should be at least 1-1/2 inch (3.8 cm) thick and 4 inches (10 cm) wide.
The exact length will vary based on how high the bottom of the bed is. Measure the distance between the bottom of the bed and the floor, holding the measuring stick at a 45 degree angle so that it juts out and away from the side of the bed.
Trim the bottom of each length on a slight angle. Doing so will allow the ladder sides to rest evenly on the floor.

, Use a router to cut notches into the sides and top of the ladder.









You'll need to create two to three pairs of notches along both ladder sides. These notches should be the size and shape of the step pieces you cut earlier. Try to match the size as evenly as possible to keep the steps more secure.
Cut a final pair of notches into the top of each side piece. These notches should allow the side pieces to fit over the bottom side of the bed.

, Slide the step pieces into the notches positioned along the ladder sides. Hold the step pieces in place using wood glue.









Test the steps once the glue dries. If they still don't seem secure, install nails or screws into each step from the outside to fix them to the ladder sides. When finished, the steps should not be able to wiggle around.

, Attach the top of the ladder to the bottom of the bed using wood glue and screws.









Note that the ladder should be centered beneath the opening of the bed rail.
Test the ladder after installing it. Make sure that it does not move around when you apply pressure.

, Screw a corner bracket over the edge of the guardrail. Secure one side of the bracket to a slat along the underside of the bed and the other side of the bracket to the outermost rail post.









Opt for a 3 inch (7.6 cm) metal corner bracket with four nail holes. Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) Phillips-head screws in each of the four screw holes.
Adding the corner bracket to the edge of the rail will make the rail more secure. Your toddler will likely grab onto this side of the rail when getting into bed, creating excess pressure on it, and the rail could collapse if it isn't properly strengthened.

, Place the mattress back on the bed and cover it with the appropriate bedding. Your toddler should now be able to use his or her newly converted bed.









If desired, you can also sand down the edges and give the bed a new coat of paint. Doing so is only necessary if the crib/bed is in bad shape after you finish making the alterations.

Ask your friend if there is anything specifically you can do to help.,
It might seem like a kind gesture to just turn up out of the blue with a week's worth of homemade frozen meals for your friend and a tonne of nappies (diapers), but, you might knock on the door just as the baby has finally fallen asleep after four hours continuous screaming, your friend might already have a jammed packed freezer or, they may just be enjoying being all alone with baby bonding.

,
Remember the newborn's siblings.,
Consider your friend's other responsibilities.,
Visit, if invited, and don't expect anything!,
Be diplomatic when you offer to help.,
Remember your friend's pre-newborn interests.,
Listen to what your friend has to say.,
Bring your friend a couple freezer meals if you're handy in the kitchen.,
Don't be offended if your friend doesn't want to let you kiss the baby, hold the baby, or babysit.,
Try not to offer advice unless asked.,
Offer to help your friend get out of the house.,
Avoid prying.,
Don't overstay your welcome.,
Remind the family to spend quality time together.",How to Help a Friend with a Newborn," Call your friend on the phone, text them, or send them an email and ask if you can do something for them. Don't turn up unannounced.


In the first few days after the birth or even births, if it's twins or more, parents can be overwhelmed, under-prepared and even a little in shock! They may not easily accept help due to uncertainty about how much help they need or how much work caring for a new baby is. Consider this when offering help and support. Until the new parents are settled into a routine, it's difficult for them to know what to ask for help with. Later on, once a routine has been established, parents may still decline offers of help because they don't want to 'put you out', or, 'be a bother'. Having some experience, they'll know more what is involved and how hard it is, they may doubt the sincerity of your offer and how interested you actually are to help in the chaos, dilemma, mess and amount of work. Assure the parents of your genuine intention to help, as long as your offer is genuine.
When you visit, make sure you have an accepting attitude and be adaptable. If you get surprised or feel gross about anything, try to be honest about it. Ultimately, the responsibility for the child is the parent's, you, as a friend, don't have to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. Don't make the parents think that they are causing you discomfort or that you are not as keen or happy to be around to help than you actually are. Babies do frequent pooping and peeing and excessive crying - if you offer to help, be ready to deal with this, or, make it clear to the parents you aren't prepared to cope with that sort of thing.;
,, An older child can feel a bit neglected while everyone is focused on the new baby, so ask your friend if you can treat any other children in the family, or, just spend some time with them. Maybe there's a homework project that needs completing that mum or dad doesn't have time to help with. Perhaps a room needs tidying or a desk needs organizing? Maybe the child just needs to talk about how they feel about the changes the new baby brings to the family and, especially, to an impartial adult. You can listen, without judging.

, If your friend cares for an elderly relative, helps out a neighbour, volunteers at a soup kitchen or anything of that nature, you could stand in for them for a while until their routine has adapted to the latest addition to the household.


Your friend is likely deeply involved in those activities and they probably energize her emotionally and spiritually. Consider offering to take care of the newborn so your friend can regenerate.

, You can make your friend a cup of tea, step over the mess, and eat when you get home. You won't be helping your friend if you visit and expect to be waited on hand and foot in an immaculate home!

, Don't make your offer sound like a criticism. Offer to unload the dishwasher, walk the dog, cook a meal, tidy up, do their laundry or do whatever you can see needs doing but be careful how you voice your offer. Try, ""I can make myself useful if you like?"" That's a nice neutral, open question. If your friend turns down your offer, push a little. They might be trying to stop you worrying they can't cope or trying to be 'super-mum'. If they really won't accept help at home, offer to go shopping or run errands. You can even say you are going to the store yourself so it's no bother for you pick them up something.

, Send them the latest issue of their favourite magazine, drop a copy of a DVD of a movie you think they'd like through their letterbox or send a nice card with some recipes you think they'd like to try. Email an online shopping voucher, share some photos of your last work 'do' on Facebook, or send a sample of a new beauty product. Go out of your way to make it about something other than the baby. Invite them to any occasions and events you would have invited them to before in the pre-baby era. They might not want to leave their newborn to come to salsa class, but they'll be pleased you gave them the choice to say no and didn't just assume they wouldn't want to (or be able to) come.


Don't be offended if your friend happens to be infatuated with their new role and disinterested in many of the things you had in common before. People respond to parenthood in different ways, so don't take it personally.

, There's every chance your friend doesn't want or need anything other from you than a sounding board. Weird things can happen during a birth and babies can do unexpected things to the family's emotions! Let your friend tell all about what freaked them out, what amazed them, what was wonderful and what wasn't and do not try to top it either with your own (or another's) birth horror stories or magic moments. If your friend is looking for reassurance that things are normal, give it, if you think that is the case. They may have many things to complain about because of the changes, how exhausting they are finding things or other unexpected occurrences, hear your friend out. If neither of you are sure what's normal and what ought to be a concern, look online together. There are lots of websites you can peruse about being a new parent. Some are funny as well as informative and some are downright bizarre so get surfing the net and have a laugh about what some people are prepared to tell the world about some very personal subjects! If you are worried about you friend's health, or that of her baby, try to persuade her it's OK to ask for help and suggest that she seek advice from a medical professional. Assure her that it's right for her to trust her instincts and get anything that is really worrying her checked out, even if it turns out to be nothing—especially if it turns out to be nothing.


Learn how to recognize the signs of post partum depression, just in case.

, Oftentimes mothers will be very busy tending for their newborn and also rather tired from sleepless nights. Freezer meals are very convenient and easy for new moms, and are especially appreciated when it's the mom's favorite dish.

, Some people are more concerned than others about exposing their infant to germs. You may have had six children and fifteen grandchildren but if your friend is anxious, she's going to worry you won't hold her baby right or you'll drop it! So, ask for a hold by all means, but don't be upset if she says she'd rather you didn't. As for taking sole charge of her precious newborn for any length of time, congratulations if you get left in charge!


If you do offer to babysit, don't get left literally holding the baby! Having a cuddle while your friend takes a shower or looking after the baby for a few hours at night between feeds is fine, but if your friend seems happy to leave her baby for an extended period without a valid reason, there might be a problem. Gently ask about bonding issues and suggest she talks to her general practitioner if there seems to be a problem.
If the baby seems to be crying incessantly, you may lull the baby to sleep by holding and rocking the baby side by side or slightly moving them up and down, still holding them close to your body.
If you seem to be taken for granted, you may still stay for the sake of the baby.
If the parents seem to be neglecting the baby for no valid reason, you may speak to any of their trusted and loving relative, if any.
Try not to compare your level of involvement or affection with your own children, or the new born with that of the parents. All relationships are different and obviously parents feel differently about their child than any friend, however close, can feel about a child that isn't their's.

, There are so many ways to parent a child, and all the methods seem to be the best! Your friend is probably already overloaded with advice about what she should do and what she shouldn't do from family, books, the TV, the midwife, the other mothers she knows as well as anyone else who thinks they know anything about babies. If you can offer some truly practical advice about something tangible like the best way to put up a cot, set up the baby monitor, or how to apply for child's benefits, offer your help and advise. If you find yourself wanting to say, ""I never held/fed/dressed/etc. my baby like that, have you tried XYZ?"" - don't!


Do not let them stress you out due to your close interactions with them. Be empathetic but firm. Remember though, you can walk away, they have to deal with their offspring 24/7 for the next 16 years, it's a bit selfish for 'you' to get stressed. If your friend asks your advice or do do a particular task, answer politely and not try not to get over excited overly emotional. You may be thrilled they want your help, but, keep things low key and agree to do as they've asked, decline, offer an alternative or just answer the question! Keeping their state of mind in your mind! They may be exhausted, stressed, sleep deprived etc. Be very clear and make instructions easy and doable so they don't get stressed about extra work.

, After a few days alone, or even with a supportive partner, being cooped up with a newborn may make your friend desperate for some fresh air and wanting to get out from indoors. It can be a mission getting a baby ready to leave the house, so help with coats for any other children, finding the dog lead, putting the pram up, making sure the back door is locked or whatever else. Your friend might even feel self-conscious pushing a pram or stroller down the street or breastfeeding in the same room as other people for the first time, so you can be there to tell her she does look like she knows what she's doing! House-sit or babysit while your friend goes out alone or with the baby if you're both happy with that arrangement.

, Your friend may seem to have it all: lovely new baby, nice house, wonderful devoted husband; the temptation to see if there's trouble in paradise can be strong. Don't ask when she last had sex, how quickly she thinks she'll regain her figure, or if she and husband can keep up the mortgage payments now that there's an extra mouth to feed! Sympathize if your friend raises concerns, but under no circumstances gossip about her fears with others or gloat in any way!


Always be pleasant but not over excited if, in the unlikely scenario, you feel like you are getting more comfortable with the environment, the baby, other siblings or one of the parents than your friend. You certainly don't want your friend to feel neglected and compare themselves to you and how much more fun you have than them in their own house.

, Hopefully you and your friend are close enough to know when you've had enough of each other's company, but if not, look for signs your friend needs you to leave. You might like to agree about how long you'll visit for before you even arrive so your friend can plan for other visitors, the baby's schedule, or just a nap!

, A new baby often disturbs family patterns, so it's important for the older siblings and the parents to keep a strong connection. Ask if they would like to go to a restaurant for dinner or another family outing. Offer to take care of the newborn while they are away, or just ask if they want to take the baby with them.

Discuss ideas for names with your partner.,
Remember that your child’s name will impact their identity.,
Think about the meaning or meanings behind a name.,
Change the spelling of your name.,
Shorten your name.,
Combine your names.,
Add “Jr.” to the end of one of your names.,
Play around with the baby’s father’s name.,
Play around with the baby’s mother’s name.,
Think about unisex names.,
Combine two names you both like or prefer.,
Look for names with a similar sound or cadence to your names.,
Look up possible names in a baby name book.,
Use an online baby name generator.,
Stay open to a variety of possibilities and be creative.",How to Create a Baby Name from Parent's Names," Get a piece of paper and have you and your partner each write down names you like. From all the names written down, you can choose which among those are the best or consider combining your choice for a name with your partner’s choice.;
, Your child will be carrying their name wherever they goes, and will be writing and spelling their name on their IDs and other important documents such as their diplomas, their certificates, their resume, their passport/visa, etc. Think about how people may react upon hearing your child’s name or reading their name on paper.


Your child’s name will likely affect how other people perceive them and will create a first impression in most people’s minds, so give your child a name they can be proud of.

, For example, a name like King means someone who is a “ruler”. A name like Emma, which is a very popular name in the Western world, means “whole” or “universal”.


Choosing names that have positive or optimistic meanings can create a positive or optimistic mindset for your child.

, For example, Suzanne can be changed to Cezanne as both have the same pronunciation. Keira that can be changed to Kyra, as you substitute the “e” with a “y.” Or you can change the letter “c” into a “k”, such as Ciara into Kiara.


You can also add a second name to your name. For example, adjust Suzanne to Cezanne Grace or Keira to Kyra Lee.

, You can use contractions by abbreviating your name, hyphenating, or adding an apostrophe to your name.


For example, Xtian for Christian, Just’n for Justin or Cath’rine for Catherine.
Hyphenated names are popular in France, and something you can try doing to come up with a name for your child. For example, Frances-Jacque or Anne-Marie.

, You can combine both you and your partner’s name and insert a hyphen in between two names. For example, if your name is Sara and your partner’s name is Michael, you can combine both of your names to come up with Sara-Michelle.


You can also take the first half of one parent’s name and combine it with the end of the other parent’s name.For example, Mark and Anna can be combined to make Mara.
For a more detailed combination, you can write each syllable of each parent’s name on separate slips of paper and arrange the slips until you come up with a unique combination. This technique opens you up to more options, as you can take a middle section of one parent’s name and combine it with the beginning of the other parent’s name.

, The most famous example of this is probably “Martin Luther King, Jr.” When using the “Jr.”, you usually add it to the name of the child’s father or mother, rather than the name of the child’s grandfather, grandmother or other relative.

, You can change the letters around in the baby’s father’s name to create a new name, based on the gender of your baby.


For example, if the baby’s father’s name is Nicholas, you could use Nika for a daughter or Niccolai for a son.
You can also try switching names around to form a new name. So if the baby’s father’s name is James Alexander, you can reverse this to Alexander James, or modify it for a girl to be Jaime Alexandra.

, You can change the letter’s around in the baby’s mother’s name or switch the mother’s names around if she has more than one name.


You can also choose to use the mother’s maiden name for your baby, depending on the gender. For example, the maiden name Jackson and Smith can be used for baby boy’s name. There are also some maiden names that can be used as unisex name such as, Brook, Gray, or Corey.
You can also modify the baby’s mother’s names to create a new name. For example, Nanta as a mother’s name can be transformed into Nathan for baby boy and Nathalie for the baby girl version.

, Names don’t always have to fall on a certain gender line. Some popular unisex names include Jack, Sydney, or Sloane.

, Once you and your partner have both written down or suggested your favorite names, see if you can put them together to form a new name.


For example, Wayne and Diane can be turned into Duanne. Or, Elizabeth and Annie can be combined to form Bethanie, Eliza, Lizanne, etc.
Combining names will help you come up with many different name possibilities and rare or unique names.

, For example, a father named Michael could name his daughter Michaela or a son Micah. While the names aren’t exactly similar, they definitely have a similar connotation to one parent’s name.


Finding similar sounds is easier if you focus on just one parent’s name. Look for names that feature the same vowel sound or similar beginning or ending sounds.

, “The Best Baby Name Book”is a great reference to find similar sounding names or to check the meaning behind a certain name.


Determine the meanings behind your name or your partner’s name and look for names from other countries that have the same or a similar meaning. For example, the name Peter means “rock”. A father named Peter could name his son Piers or his daughter Petra to pass on the similar meaning to his children.

, After trying out several different spellings, pronunciations, and combinations or alternative meanings, you still may not hit on a satisfactory name for your baby. So use online tools like a baby name generator. These sites will usually ask you to enter your name and your partner’s name, or two names you are trying to combine, and then provide a list of different possible combinations.You can also customize your search by choosing a specific gender, male or female, and origin, such as English, African, Australian, French, Russian, etc.There are also sites where you can find out the meaning or meanings behind certain names., Look at a variety of names, and if you prefer, go for names that are interesting or unique over names that are more conventional or possibly considered boring. Make sure both you and your partner have input on the name of the child. With enough collaboration and research, you can both come up with the right name for your baby.

Dress your newborn.",How to Give a Newborn a Sponge Bath," One of the most important things you should do when giving a newborn a bath is to establish a routine. By creating a routine, you’ll give your baby a sense of stability and predictability. This will help soothe them and make future baths go a lot easier.


Choose a specific time of day, if possible. For example, you may want to establish the routine of bathing your baby at night.
Establish your bathing routine in relation to your feeding routine. Consider feeding your baby either before or after bath time.;
, You’ll need a wide variety of supplies ready before you start the bath. This is important as you won’t want to get up and leave your baby in the middle of the tub. Your most important supplies include:


Washcloths and a sponge
Towels
Baby shampoo
Moisturizing soap
Baby wipes
A change of clothes, While you might think any tub will work, you’ll need a tub with an infant insert that will hold your baby securely. Without an infant insert, your baby may slide down into the water. This could not only be dangerous but uncomfortable for your baby., The best place to give your newborn a sponge bath is a place with a large flat surface. This is important, as you’ll need to place the tub down and have room to move around it. Consider:


A changing table.
A firm bed.
The floor of your bathroom. In this case, you may want to put a blanket or towel under the tub to pad the hard floor., Before you get your newborn wet, you need to make sure that the room you’ll sponge bath your baby in is between 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 27 degrees Celsius). If the room isn’t warm enough, your baby could get cold and may get sick., Fill the tub with water that is warm, rather than hot. Water should never be higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) when you place your infant in it. The tub should also not be full. Instead, try to fill it about a third of the way – no more than several inches deep.


Never expose your baby to water that is hotter than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius). This could cause third-degree burns very quickly., Make sure to make a serious effort to soothe your baby and keep them calm during the bath. You can do this by making noises, telling them they’re good or holding their hand. Ultimately, it is important to make sure the bath is not a traumatic event for the infant.Consider putting on white noise during the bath.

, When washing your infant’s body, you need to make sure you are gentle around the umbilical cord stump. While it is okay to clean around it, you don’t want to hit it or get it directly wet.


If you do get the stump wet, make sure to dab it dry., Slowly put your infant in the tub. Start by sliding their feet in and then slowly move their legs and body into the water. As you do this, make sure that they are snuggly and comfortably settled into the infant insert., It is important to regularly pour warm water over your baby while they’re in the tub. This will stop your baby from getting cold on parts of their body that are above the water line.


Use a cup or similar object to pour water on your baby., Take a little soap, lather your hands up, and soap your baby’s body up. Make sure to use as little soap as possible. Pay special attention to areas where they accumulate dirt or germs, like the diaper area and hands., Dampen a sponge or washcloth with warm water and wash your baby’s entire body. Start at the neck and move downward toward the torso and then legs. Make sure you get as much soap off as possible. Remember to:


Get in between their buttocks and private parts.
Clean between their fingers and toes., Dip a corner of a microfiber washcloth in warm water and use it to wash their face. Do this systematically and wipe from side-to-side. Make sure to get around the mouth, under the nose, and around and behind their ears., Tip your baby’s head back slightly. Take a very small amount of baby shampoo and gently massage it into your infant’s hair. Make sure you get full coverage of the scalp, as a baby’s hair can become oily and dirty just like an adult’s hair.Be careful as to not get any shampoo into your infant’s eyes.

, After you’ve wiped your baby down with soap, you need to make sure you wash off all the shampoo and soap you cleaned them with. Residual soap or shampoo could dry out their hair or skin., Gently remove your baby from the tub and place them on a clean, flat surface. This is important, as you’ll need a safe place to dry your baby off and dress them.


If it is convenient, you may want to place your baby on a changing table. If this isn’t convenient, you may want to place your baby on a clean towel next to the bathtub.

, Take a dry towel and gently pat your baby dry. Patting is important, as you could irritate your baby’s skin if you rub them. Also, if your towel gets wet, make sure to replace it with a dry one., After you’ve dried your infant, you’ll need to wrap them in a towel. You may want to consider using a hooded towel to cover your baby’s neck and head. Ultimately, though, the towel should be clean, soft, and large enough to cover their entire body.


You may want to wrap your baby up right away after placing them on a flat dry surface. This will keep them warm and help dry them., Make sure to dress your newborn quickly after they are dry. This is important, as the baby could become cold almost immediately. As a result, use the change of clothes you set aside earlier to dress them.

Find out the hospital protocol regarding bathing newborns.,
Request to have your baby’s bath delayed.,
Talk with all hospital staff about your wishes prior to the delivery.,
Add a section on baby care to your birth plan.,
Place a note in the bassinet prior to delivery.",How to Delay Your Baby's First Bath1," In order to delay your newborn’s first bath you should find out what the bathing protocol is for your hospital. Ask your obstetrician or midwife when babies are typically bathed following delivery, and then you can decide if you want to make a special request. Some hospitals will bathe infants shortly after birth, while others will wait longer.For example, at Toronto East General Hospital, a healthy baby who has a stabilized temperature will likely be bathed around 8 hours after birth.
In comparison, at BC Women’s Hospital an infant can be bathed at any point between 4 hours and 24 hours postnatal.;
, If you and your partner have decided that you want to wait a minimum of 24 hours before bathing your infant, depending on the hospitals bathing protocol, you may need to request to have your baby’s first bath delayed. You also may want to wait and bathe your child for the first time at home, using your own products. If this is the case, you should request that your baby is not bathed at all while in the hospital. Hospitals will typically honour requests to delay the first bath.If you are not comfortable bathing your baby on your own, then you might ask to have the first bath done at the hospital with a nurse to guide you through it. This may be especially helpful if this is your first baby.
Make this request by talking with your doctor prior to the delivery of your child. You may be overwhelmed during the birthing process and forget to make a request during delivery.
If you use a midwife or doula you should also speak with them about a delayed bath in advance of delivery.

, If you have decided to delay your infant’s first bath make sure that this request is communicated to all hospital staff that will be involved in the delivery process. This includes all of the nurses and doctors that are present during the delivery and those that will be involved throughout your stay at the hospital.Your doctor will not always be available and may not remember to communicate your wishes to other hospital staff.
Bathing is typically performed by nurses and as a result you may want to communicate directly with the nurses, rather than relying on your doctor to pass along the message.

, Most pregnant women are instructed to create a birth plan prior to delivering their child. You can include a section on newborn baby care in your birth plan, and state that you would like to delay the first bath. This will ensure that your wishes are written on paper and will not lead to any confusion following the birth of your child.Be specific in your birth plan. For example, if you would like the bath delayed 24 hours that should be stated. That way hospital staff will know your exact wishes.

, Another way to ensure that all hospital staff are aware of your wishes to delay your baby's first bath would be to put a note directly on the baby's bassinet that clearly communicates your request. For instance, the note could say ""Please do not bathe me! My parents are delaying my first bath.""


This note may prevent your child from being bathed following the delivery while you and your partner are distracted with new parent responsibilities, or by well-meaning staff in the infant nursery.
While many nurses or other hospital staff will not take the time to read an entire birth plan, a note taped to the side of a bassinet will be more visible and obvious.

Difficulty sleeping can be a long-term symptom, and if you know the early warning signs and how to treat them ahead of time, you can avoid severe sleep deprivation all together.Be sure to take time to read any ""baby blues"" literature your doctor gives you before baby's arrival, so that you know what to expect.;
, Before your baby arrives, talk about sleeping arrangements and devise a nighttime baby care plan with your significant other. Having a set plan before baby’s arrival will help reduce stress for both of you and allow you to jump right into a routine as soon as you bring baby home from the hospital.Some couples find that alternating feeding shifts throughout the night helps them each get reasonable rest while caring for a newborn.
Other couples alternate baby care every other night. For example, Mama might be on baby care duty on Monday night and Daddy will take Tuesday night. This guarantees that each parent will get at least one full night of sleep every other night.
When it’s your night to take care of the baby, consider having a bed in the nursery, so that your partner can rest in the bedroom without interruption on his or her night off.

, If you’re hoping to breastfeed your baby, buy a breast pump and learn how to use it before your baby arrives. Having a breast pump will allow others to help feed your baby while you rest, and you won’t feel guilty thinking that your extended absence is depriving your baby of important nutrition.

, It’s natural to worry about your baby, but you’ll worry less and sleep better if you have a good baby monitor or health alert system keeping track of your baby when you’re out of the nursery or fast asleep.


Many health alert systems also monitor baby's heartbeat and breathing, so when you hear your baby cry, you can determine if it’s just fussiness (which potentially allows you to spend more time in bed) or if something is wrong and immediately requires your attention.
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not recommend using baby monitors that are advertised to reduce the risk of SIDS because they can cause unnecessary worry and stress that outweigh the benefits that they provide., Not everyone has the resources or the desire to hire a nanny or night-nurse, but a childcare specialist may be worth the investment if both you and your partner work full-time or have demanding careers, or if you don't have a partner. You and your partner are going to need your rest once the baby arrives. If one or both of you is sleep-deprived during the day, your daily productivity will be significantly reduced, so having a nanny or night-nurse might be a worthy investment.


Take the time before baby arrives to discuss your nanny budget, interview plenty of candidates, and choose the person that is right for your family and future baby. This is not a decision you want to rush.

, A newborn is a lot of work. If you take on extra responsibility within your community, at your job, or among friends and family right before your baby is born, you’ll be too busy to rest once the baby comes, even in the rare moments your baby doesn’t need you.


It’s okay to be selfish with your time and your sleep needs during this critical period for you and your baby, so be sure not to make any extra commitments.

, Having a baby is an incredible experience, but your body needs to recover from birth, and that requires rest. While you’re still in the hospital or surrounded by midwives (if you’ve had a home birth), utilize the nursery services they provide for the first 24-48 hours after giving birth so you can rest and recover.

, Most new moms are overwhelmed with taking care of a demanding newborn and feel tempted to catch up on other duties when their babies finally sleep. As hard as it might be to let dishes pile up in the sink and constantly walk past unfolded piles of laundry, your sleep is more important. Take time to rest while the house is quiet and your baby is asleep.

, When your baby is a few weeks old and you’ve had a chance to recover from delivery, consider buying a sling or baby-carrier as you begin to do chores, work, and run errands again. By carrying your baby with you while you take care of your other responsibilities, you’ll get more done during the day, which will prevent you from feeling like you need to work into the night., Newborn babies are hard work. Don’t be afraid to ask friends and family for help with baby care, household chores, and even dinner duty. You’ll find that many people are eager to help and have the opportunity to snuggle and visit with your newborn.


Use this time to take a nap, have a shower, or relax alone in your room. Don’t feel guilty about resting while others help around your house., Sleep deprivation isn’t just about getting enough sleep but also about when you get it. If your baby isn’t on a regular sleep schedule, chances are that you aren’t either and you’re feeling exceptionally tired, as a result. One you have your baby home, try to set feeding and sleeping routines as quickly and strictly as possible.


Even if your baby isn’t sleeping through the night, your body will adapt to sleeping at 2 or 3 hour intervals at a time and still thrive, provided that those short sleep sessions become routine., All parents want to maintain an orderly household with home-cooked meals and a hands-on routine, but with a newborn, the more time you spend on chores, the less time you have to rest. For the first few months in caring for a newborn, consider keeping the freezer stocked with frozen meals, send your kids to school with lunch money or healthy pre-made lunches, order takeout for dinner, and hire a home cleaning service and/or meal service.


You might spend a little more money on these conveniences, but you will have more time to stop and rest, which is priceless when you have a newborn.
Your newborn will grow fast and sleep better and longer with each passing month, so you won’t have to cut corners forever.

, If all else fails and both you and your baby are suffering from extreme sleep deprivation, there is professional help available. Talk to your healthcare provider about seeing a pediatric sleep or behavioral specialist.


There may be underlying issues that are preventing your baby (and you) from getting a good night’s rest, so it’s important to seek help if you suspect there might be a problem.Talk to your doctor about sleep issues that you are having, and discuss any related issues such as stress or problems you are having due to sleep-deprivation.

Wipe the baby’s eyes with a damp cloth.",How to Delay Your Baby's First Bath2," The vernix caseosa can be massaged into the baby’s skin as a form of moisturizer. This substance is one of the best moisturizers for your baby’s skin and cannot be compared to any store-bought products. You can do this immediately following the delivery when the baby is placed on the mother’s chest for skin-to-skin bonding. Gently massage the baby in order to absorb the vernix caseosa.If you bathe your baby too soon following delivery, the baby will not receive the added benefits of the vernix caseosa and an artificial moisturizer will likely be applied to the baby’s skin following a bath., Following delivery, the baby can be gently wiped off using a soft and damp cloth. This will help to remove any blood, amniotic fluid, or vaginal secretions without removing the vernix caseosa. In order to wash off the vernix caseosa you need to scrub the skin and it does not come off easily in water. As a result, gently wiping the baby with a damp cloth will not remove the vernix caseosa and will allow you to clean off some of the other substances that can be found on the baby’s skin following delivery., Instead of giving your child a full bath with water and soap, you can help the baby regulate their temperature by washing the face, head, and hair with a damp cloth. This should be done while the infant is fully wrapped or swaddled in blankets in order to keep them warm.Do not use any soap, moisturizer, or other products on a newborn baby. Instead, gently wipe the face, head, and hair with a damp cloth.

, Taking a damp cloth, gently wipe the baby’s eyes from the inside corner to the outside corner. This will help to remove any sticky film that may develop around an infant’s eye."

However, many babies start to roll over by about three to four months of age, and at this stage, they cannot control their heads very well. Keep in mind that an older swaddled baby may be at risk of falling or of rolling over onto his or her stomach and winding up face-down on a bed or other surface, posing a suffocation risk.;
, When your baby is ready to give up swaddling (usually by somewhere between four and six months of age), he or she may give you some signals. These could include:


crying when swaddled
struggling to loosen the blanket
becoming unswaddled regularly during sleep. If this starts happening when your baby is still young, take care – remember that blankets and other coverings can pose a suffocation risk.

, Babies are born with what’s known as the “Moro reflex” or “startle reflex” – when startled (and sometimes for no reason in particular), they fling their arms out sideways. Newborns tend to startle easily and flap their arms and legs a lot; swaddling helps them stay calm and still enough to sleep. For best results, wait until the Moro reflex disappears before you wean your baby from swaddling -- unless your baby has started rolling and safety becomes a concern earlier.

, Once you believe your baby is ready, think about how you will make the transition? Will you start at naptime or nighttime? When will you begin? How will you handle the difficulties that arise?


Consider setting aside a weekend or another convenient time to experiment with unswaddling your baby. Know that you may have to sacrifice some of your baby's normal sleep time to do this. If your partner can help, that's preferable -- you can take turns observing your baby's preferences and trying to soothe your baby without swaddling.

, Plan to keep as many routines as possible in place when you wean your baby from swaddling. If you keep the same sleep routines (dim lights, bath, lullaby, whatever you typically do) in place, your baby will be more likely to accept sleeping unswaddled.

, In general, unwrapping your baby suddenly and completely doesn't work well; your baby may feel uncomfortable and struggle to sleep. If you have a very active baby who has been wriggling out of the swaddle independently, you can try this method. Otherwise, a more gradual approach is probably best.


If you do choose to unswaddle your baby ""cold turkey,"" try it at nap time first. That way, if it doesn't work out, you won't sacrifice much sleep.

, Many babies accept unswaddled sleeping more readily if you start gradually. Try leaving his or her hands and armed swaddled as usual, but unwrap the legs. You can use special swaddling products for this purpose, or you can improvise with blankets, cloth diapers, and the like.

, Alternatively, you can start by unswaddling your baby’s hands and arms, while leaving the legs wrapped as usual. For best results, leave just one hand free at first, then move on to both hands.

, As your baby accepts each stage of unswaddling, move forward until he or she is sleeping with no swaddling whatsoever.

, If your baby struggles to sleep, wakes frequently, or seems upset, do not move forward. Wait until he or she can accept the first stage (an unwrapped arm or unwrapped legs) before unswaddling further.

, If your baby really loves swaddling, it might help to start by unswaddling only during naptime or only for the first few hours of nighttime sleep (say, until he or she wakes to breastfeed). Gradually increase the time spent unswaddled.

, If your baby is struggling to fall asleep without being swaddled, try gently holding his or her hands against the chest. This may soothe your baby and let him or her fall asleep.

, There are a number of products on the market, shaped like sleeping bags, to help babies stay warm and calm without tight swaddling. If your baby seems comfortable in one of these, use it! You can gradually unclip the sleeping bag to ease your baby into the feeling of freedom.


In addition to the bags, there are also swaddling straps available that keep older babies comfortably swaddled. If your baby is struggling to sleep without his or her usual swaddling, you could consider using one of these products temporarily.

, If your baby wakes and cries more easily when he or she is not swaddled, try using other soothing techniques. For example, consider:


singing a lullaby
playing soothing music
wearing your baby in a sling and walking around
rocking your baby

, Soothe your baby as needed, but as soon as he or she is calm, put your baby back in the crib to go back to sleep. Every baby is different, and yours may take some time to accept these new sleeping arrangements.

Talk to your baby about the transition.,
Place a mattress or crib right next to your bed.,
Start placing your baby in the crib or on her own mattress for nap time.,
Gradually begin to move the bed or crib away from your bed while continuing each night to reassure him that you are right next to him.,
When you have moved her bed to her own room, lie down with her while she falls asleep.,
When your baby wakes up during the night, hold her hand and soothe her, but do not let her come back into your own bed.",How to Wean Your Baby from Your Bed," Read him books about babies and children who sleep through the night. Talk about how happy it makes Mommy and Daddy when he sleeps until morning. Make a point to emphasize that daytime is for playing and having fun, while nighttime is for sleeping and relaxing. Remember to reinforce every little step he makes with praise.;
, If possible, use an elevated baby crib that can turn into a daybed. It is best if the crib is the same height as your mattress. If using a mattress, place it on the floor next to your bed, as it would be dangerous to place your baby on a bed if she is old enough to roll.

, After rocking her to sleep, place her in her own bed. When she wakes up and cries, pick her up and soothe her, reinforcing the idea that you are still there and she is safe.

, By repeating this process you will be able to move the crib into his own room when he grows used to sleeping apart.

, Rub her back and make sure she knows you are there. Eventually she will begin to fall asleep more quickly each night.

, Eventually she will grow comfortable with her own room knowing that you will soothe her if she needs comfort.

Wake your baby if the nap gets too long.",How to Put Your Baby on a Nap Schedule," It’s important to start a baby on napping schedule when they’re ready for it. In most cases, you should wait until your baby is 3 to 4 months old before you try to start a nap schedule. That’s usually the point when they start to develop more regular patterns of daytime sleep, so starting before that age can be difficult.If your baby is younger than 3 months but is starting to develop more predictable sleep patterns, you can try to encourage them by introducing a schedule.;
, You’ll have an easier time getting your child to adhere to a schedule if you use their natural routine as a guideline. When you decide that you’re ready to start a schedule, start tracking the times that your baby naturally falls asleep during the day. Pay attention to how long they sleep as well.Keep track of your baby’s natural routine for at least a week. The longer that you do it, the easier it will be to pinpoint a natural schedule.
You can track your baby’s napping in a notebook or a spreadsheet on your computer. There are also apps, such as Trixie Tracker or Baby Bundle, which allow you to track your baby’s sleep schedule, as well as their feeding and diaper change schedules.

, When you start tracking your baby’s natural napping routine, you may begin to notice certain signs that indicate they need a nap. Pay attention to things like yawning, rubbing at the eyes, pulling at the ears, sucking on fingers, or becoming cranky to determine what your child does when they’re tired.You may notice other signals that mean it’s a good time for your baby to take a nap, such as always falling asleep after lunch or an afternoon walk in the park.
Once you know your baby's natural routine and signals, try to start your napping routine just before their usual sleepy time or just as the signals are starting. It's better to start the routine before they get overtired.

, There are two main ways to plan your baby’s napping schedule. You can use a baby-led schedule, where you follow the baby’s cues and put them down when they appear tired, or you can use a parent-led schedule, where you train the baby to nap at certain times. A baby-led schedule is more flexible, while the parent-led schedule tends to be more strict.While a baby-led schedule may not seem like much of a schedule, keep in mind that most babies are developing natural sleeping patterns by 3 or 4 months of age. That means they’ll start to nap at roughly the same time on most days.

, No matter what type of nap schedule you decide on, the key to getting your baby to stick to it is consistency. You don’t necessarily have to put your child down at the same precise time everyday, but don’t put them down right after lunch one day and two hours after lunch the next. It will be much more difficult for your child to develop regular napping patterns, so try to put them down within the same half hour to an hour each day.Keep your child’s usual napping times in mind when you’re planning their activities. For example, if you want to take your child to a music class, try to find one that’s scheduled when they are usually awake.
Another way to be consistent with your baby’s napping is developing a napping routine. Do the same things each time you put your baby down, so they can start to learn when it’s time to nap.

, While consistency is crucial to getting your baby on a napping schedule, it’s also important to allow for possible interruptions in the schedule. Your doctor’s appointment may run late one day, or you may get stuck in traffic on your way home from running errands. Try to stick to the schedule as much as possible, but think of it as window of time, such as 11 to 11:30, rather than a precise time.Don’t worry if your baby misses a nap or winds up napping an hour or more later every once in a while. If you have a schedule in place, it will be easy to get your child back on it. Being too rigid with a schedule can lead to stress for you and it may also cause you to miss out on some fun times with your baby.

, Setting the right mood when you want your baby to nap is just as important as it is when you fall asleep yourself. Start by lowering the lights in your nursery or wherever your child naps, so they can start to wind down.If natural light filters into the baby’s room, make sure to draw the curtains or lower the blinds too to keep the space dark. You can also try some light blocking curtains to help make the room even darker.
Consider the temperature of the room too. You want it to be cool enough for the baby to nap comfortably, so you may want to turn on a fan if necessary.

, You can help your baby relax further by reading a favorite story and/or singing a favorite song as you rock them. Eventually, your child will begin to recognize the story and song routine as signal that it’s time to rest., If your baby fights going down for a nap, it helps to make a soothing activity part of your nap routine. Consider nursing them or giving them a warm bath just before nap time to help calm and relax the baby. Taking the baby on a drive or for a walk can also help lull the baby to sleep.Giving your baby a gentle massage can help relax their muscles and make them more receptive to sleep too., After you’ve finished your song and/or story, you may want to cuddle with your baby a moment before putting them down in the crib. Try to put your baby in the crib while they are drowsy but not yet sleeping. Be sure to place your child on their back in the crib to ensure that they’re safe. Don’t wait around until your baby has fallen asleep; leave the room as soon as they’re safely in the crib.Make sure that your baby’s crib is free of stuffed toys, pillows, and blankets before you put them down for their nap too.
If your baby cries when you put them down, it usually means they're overtired so try to pay closer attention to their signals when they're first getting tired the next time. To get the baby to nap, try holding them closely and rocking them or taking them for a stroller ride to soothe them until they are drowsy.If your baby refuses to drift off, give them a few more minutes to get drowsy. If this does not work, then you may want to give up on the nap for now and move up their next nap by an hour.

, While it probably doesn't seem like a good idea to wake a baby who's sleeping peacefully, it may be necessary in some cases. Your baby should nap between 3 and 5 hours a day. If they're napping longer than that, you should wake them to prevent the naps from affecting their sleep at night.You should also wake your baby if they're sleeping so long that it will affect their next nap or their bedtime. By waking your child, you'll help get them on the regular nap schedule that you're trying to create.

Decide whether your twins will share a room or have two separate nurseries.,
Determine if your babies will share one crib or have two separate cribs.,

Stock up on basic layette clothing.,
Determine whether your twins will be breastfed or bottle fed.,
Make the most of storage space in your nursery or nurseries.",How to Prepare a Nursery for Twins," Many parents of twins choose to have their babies share a room. Twins tend to enjoy each other’s company and parents find the two babies in one room very convenient.


Consider the long term effects of where the babies will sleep. Will they always share a room or would you like them to have their own room as they get older? If your goal is to have them in separate rooms when they are older, you can still have them share a nursery now, but keep your long term goal in mind when purchasing furniture and accessories.;
, There are double cribs that can hold two babies available on the market, but they tend to be very expensive. Double cribs usually cannot be converted to single cribs or beds later on, so if you choose this option, be aware that the crib will not grow with your babies.


Consider purchasing a crib divider if you choose to use one crib. Crib dividers, though not a necessity, can be a convenient way for parents to offer separate space for each baby. Dividers are secured to the crib walls and can easily be removed when desired. Some parents believe it is best to keep the twins in the same crib in the beginning then graduate to two cribs as the babies grow. This will save some money up front when so much of it is being spent on other necessities.

, You can also choose two colors of paint for the walls, or decorate each twin’s area with different wall decals. This is especially helpful when a boy and girl are sharing a nursery.

, The more undershirts, pajamas and mix and match outfits you have, the more time you can go between loads of laundry. Keep in mind, twins’ clothing doesn’t always have to coordinate. The more variety you have, the larger their wardrobe will seem.


Purchase basic clothing in neutral colors if you are having both a boy and a girl. This will allow you to interchange the clothing between both babies. Even if you have a closet full of traditional pinks and blues, you can stretch your dollars by purchasing neutral colored onesies, undershirts, socks and pajamas.

,


Consider purchasing a nursing pillow if you choose to breast feed. This will allow you to breast feed the babies at the same time, while the pillow helps to support the twins. Purchasing two nursing pillows will not be necessary as it is a large pillow that wraps at your waist and you will only be able to use one. Even if you end up nursing both babies at the same time, they will be able to share the one pillow.
Stock up on bottles and bottle accessories if you decide to bottle feed your twins. To cut down on the time you will spend washing bottles, considering purchasing bottles with disposable liners that can be conveniently thrown away after each use. Although convenient, some parents are not comfortable with generating so much waste. Parents who prefer an eco-friendly option can invest in a bottle sterilizer/cleaner that can wash and sanitize a lot of bottles at one time.

,


Consider installing floor to ceiling shelving even if you are not short on space. Babies come with a lot of ‘stuff’. The addition of just one baby generates an overwhelming amount of clutter, from personal care items, toys and books to clothes, blankets and baby gear. When you are expecting twins, you can expect double the baby items, which leaves you with less room space. Good storage options are a must.
Opt for storage baskets if the nursery is too small to accommodate multiple storage shelves. Purchase storage baskets or bins that can easily slide under the crib or dresser. These come in a variety of sizes and are perfect for storing small toys, books, blankets and other small items.

, While many parents find comfort in co-sleeping and are therefore able to achieve better quality sleep, some parents will be more nervous about sharing a bed with their newborn. Fears about harming the baby can prevent parents from achieving a restful sleep.Additionally, many parents will be so in tuned with every move their newborn makes that they will find themselves waking every time their baby so much as whimpers.

, If you allow your newborn to co-sleep with you, you will eventually have to wean him off of this behavior, which could be difficult for the baby., As such, he or she may be more likely to sleep more soundly through the night.Many newborns have a difficult time regulating their sleeping cycle, and in the early days after delivery, many parents find that their baby is awake at night and spends his daytime hours fast asleep. Co-sleeping can be an effective way for parents to help regulate their baby’s sleep/wake cycle.

, Both moms and dads can suffer from total exhaustion after their baby is born. The constant up and down all night to respond to baby’s cries will only add to this dilemma.Allowing your newborn to co-sleep with you means no jumping out of the bed and stumbling around in the dark to attend to a crying baby.

, Consider how much easier it is for a new mom to doze off and catch up on some much needed rest if she is lying next to a nursing baby in the wee hours of the morning.Breastfed babies can eat as often as every 1.5 hours. Being able to simply shift positions and offer the breast to a hungry baby is much easier than having to jump up every two hours or so to tend to the baby’s needs.

, Your baby may feel less insecure if he is lying next to you at night while he sleeps. Therefore, he may be less likely to experience stress than if he were placed in a crib to sleep., Despite still being in the minority, many physicians and mental health specialists believe that co-sleepers can grow to be more confident and have greater self esteem than children that never co-slept with parents., Your sleep may be affected and awareness of your baby may be significantly diminished., A higher risk of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) has been linked with parents that smoke., Children cannot as readily recognize that a baby is present while they sleep. Even a toddler is capable of causing suffocation to a baby, should he roll on top of the baby during sleep., Babies should never sleep in an adult bed without an adult present. Even the tiniest newborn can manage to squirm to the edge of a bed and fall off or suffocate on soft bedding, pillows, or blankets., Deep sleep may prevent you from being easily aroused by your baby’s movements.Only you know how in-tune you are with your baby during the night and how light or heavy of a sleeper you are. If there is any question as to your ability to remain aware of your newborn throughout the night, co-sleeping should be avoided.

, Obesity has been linked to sleep apnea, which increases the risk of smothering a baby during restless sleep., Consider the entire room to be a new nursery area for your newborn baby and adjust any safety issues as necessary.If your bed is located near a window, be sure to wash the curtains to remove any dust or debris that may have accumulated. If your bed is positioned underneath a ceiling vent, consider relocating it to another area of the room so your baby is not directly affected by forced air while he sleeps.

, Before bringing an infant into your bed, make any necessary changes to ensure that his safety and comfort are prioritized. You should be the one to adjust your sleeping pattern.Consider the size of the bed. Is it large enough for parents and the baby to sleep in comfortably? Trying to squish a baby into a bed with parents when the bed is not big enough to accommodate everyone is dangerous.
A firm mattress is recommended for the safety of the baby. Newborns are especially susceptible to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and it is believed that one risk factor is a lack of freely-circulating air. A mattress that is too soft can create a pocket that traps air when baby exhales, causing him to re-breathe that air rather than breathe in fresh oxygen.
Never let a baby sleep on a waterbed.
Purchase proper fitting sheets. Sheets should always fit tight enough on the mattress to prevent any wrinkles. Make sure that the corners are able to be firmly tucked in without posing any risk of slipping off. Consider the quality of your sheets as well, since rough sheets may irritate a baby's sensitive skin.
Think about removing the head board or foot board, as there is always a slight possibility that it can entrap your baby.
Consider the blanket you will be using to cover yourself during sleep. Avoid bulky comforters or other bedding that can easily entangle your baby or muffle your newborn baby’s cries. It may be best to add layers to your body and skip using a blanket at all.

, Again, make the necessary changes to prioritize your baby's safety and adapt to them.Lower the bed or consider placing the mattress on the floor. Accidents can happen, and this is the easiest way to prevent your baby from getting injured by falling out of the bed.
Push the bed flush against a wall as much as possible to help prevent baby from falling off of the bed. If gaps between the bed and the wall are present, roll a blanket or towel into a firm roll and wedge it securely into the space.
Consider purchasing a guard rail that has been designed to prevent a newborn baby from falling off of the bed. Do not use a rail designed for a larger toddler as they can pose a danger to tiny newborns.
Place an extra plush area rug or yoga mat along the edge of the bed to help lessen any injuries to baby in the event that a fall does occur.
Survey the area surrounding your bed. Be sure that there are no draperies or cords that could present a risk of entanglement to baby. Check for wall sockets that are close to the bed. Consider sealing off the entire socket system by placing a safety cover over the socket.

, Remove any throw pillows, stuffed animals or extra pillows from the bed. The only items that should be on the bed are those that are absolutely necessary for safe and comfortable sleeping., Mothers generally seem to be better at instinctively recognizing the presence of their baby during sleep. It is safer to place the baby in this position rather than in-between both parents., The ""Back is Best"" campaign has significantly reduced the instance of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome over the past several years., Never put a sleeping cap on, which could pull down over his face. Also beware of blankets, pillows and any other item that could cover his face. Infants cannot remove obstructions to breathing., Keep in mind that your baby may require less clothing because body heat will be transmitted from one person to another. Babies tend to require less covering to remain warm than adults., Generally speaking, the less you place between you and your baby, the better. This will make breastfeeding simpler and facilitate bonding.Sleep in clothing that is free from straps, ties or strings that may entangle your baby while you sleep. Necklaces or other items of jewelry may become potential risks as well, so use your best judgment.
Avoid the use of perfumed lotions, deodorants or hair products that can mask the natural smell of mom. Your baby will instinctively be attracted to your natural scent. In addition, these products may cause irritation your baby’s tiny nasal passages.

Flip the corner.,
Finish the swaddle.,
Finished.",How to Swaddle a Baby1," Arrange it in a diamond shape. The blanket should be at least 40""x40"" and if you can buy a blanket specifically for swaddle, this is best.


You will also want to make sure that the swaddle blanket is a very thin, stretchy material. This will make it easier to swaddle the baby but will also keep him or her from getting too hot.;
, The fold at the top should be about as long as the baby is tall.

, Lay down the baby on the blanket, so that his or her neck is on the fold. If your baby is very young, be sure their head and body are properly supported while you do this.

, Gently place the baby's arm at his or her side, and hold it in place. Alternatively, you can hold it bent towards their chest/tummy, like they are in the womb. This is harder to swaddle tightly, though your baby will be more comfortable.

, Pull one corner of the blanket (the same as the arm you're holding in place) over the baby's body, and tuck it underneath his or her back. The blanket should be tucked snugly enough to hold the baby's arm in place at his or her side.

, Gently place the baby's other arm at his or her side, and hold it in place. As with the previous arm, you can also move this one to the chest/tummy as well.

, Pull the bottom corner of the blanket up toward the center of the baby's shoulders. Tuck it behind the baby's left shoulder so that it's between the shoulder and the bottom layer of the blanket.



Important: Leave plenty of room for the baby's feet to move within the swaddle. This will prevent overheating and, over the long term, hip dysplasia.

, Fold it so that the left and right corners form a V-neck swaddle. Don't tuck the end anywhere yet. Using your left hand, gently hold the blanket in place on the baby's chest.

, With your right hand, flip over the right corner which should be somewhere near the baby's feet.

, Pull the flipped right corner up over the baby's right shoulder, and tuck it into the back of the swaddle. You'll probably need to lift the baby to complete the final tuck.

, Make sure your baby doesn't get too hot and that their airway is not blocked. Never swaddle a pacifier into a baby's mouth.

Understand SIDS.,
Don't swaddle too tight.,
Don't swaddle a pacifier into your baby's mouth.,
Keep your baby on its back.,
Use a firm mattress in baby's crib.,
Remove excess pillows, stuffed animals, and other items from the crib.",How to Swaddle a Baby2," SIDS, or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, is the sudden and unexplainable death of a healthy baby.This usually happens when the baby is asleep. Many parents worry about SIDS and they may associate it with swaddling. This is because, many times, the cause of the infant's death is later determined to be suffocation due to a number of factors. However, swaddling itself cannot cause SIDS. If precautions are taken, swaddling is very safe and beneficial to your baby.

, If you swaddle the baby too tight, especially if the baby is very young, they may have trouble filling their lungs with air. The swaddle should be tight enough that they can inhale, just not loose enough that they can get their arms free. Keep an eye on your baby for a few minutes and make sure their breathing isn't labored, if you're worried.

, Babies spit out their pacifiers and then get upset when they realize it's not there anymore. This is a near universal occurrence! But you should not swaddle the baby so that the pacifier is held in their mouth. It will solve the spitting out problem, but if your baby needs to breathe through their mouth or something like that, it can cause them to choke!

, This is the most important way to keep your baby safe while sleeping, especially if they are swaddled. Infants are very weak and often not strong enough to lift their body with each inhale enough to get a proper breath of air if they are on their stomach. This is why you should always sleep a baby on its back: so that it can breathe free and easy.

, A mattress which is too soft can suffocate a baby, if they do end up face-down in the crib. A firm mattress will let baby sleep and keep them safe.

, These present a hazard, if baby gets its face pushed up against items like these. Only put things in the crib which baby absolutely needs.

Understand why your baby might be crying.,Adjust the items that are out of ""whack"" in the list, if any are present.,
Find the pacifier.,
Grab the pacifier by the holder-mechanism and hold it there, until you've re-acquainted yourself with your baby.

,Grab the knob to the pacifier's face mask, where the holder mechanism and mask meet.,
Rub the pacifier gently along the child's lips, if they aren't wailing at the top of their lungs.,
Push the pacifier into the child's mouth, until the face-shield meets their face.

,
Wait for the baby.",How to Use a Pacifier," Make a mental checklist in your mind of reasons why your baby might be crying that using a pacifier won't help fix.


Perhaps it's the baby feels it's time for a new diaper and doesn't want to feel that way.






Or perhaps it's hungry and it's coming due-time for a fresh baby bottle of formula.






Perhaps the baby is sick, or the room is not quite right (temperature-wise). The reasons are endless.






Check for all conditions on the baby to not be apparent.
Realize that these aren't the only reasons, but are two of the more common ones.;
,, Although your system is different than anyone else's system, some of the more common places the pacifier could be kept could include on a shelf on the changing table underneath the changing station, on top of a dresser, or even in a cup-holder to the nearest baby stroller. The possibilities are endless and you know your house and organization style best.

,,, They will eventually open their mouth just a little bit, enough for you to insert the pacifier into their mouth.


If they are wailing at the top of their lungs, you may skip this step.

,, The baby may accept the pacifier, or try to push the pacifier out of it's mouth. Repeat the process from the beginning,as the baby may have figured out that the problem it was wailing about, hasn't been ""cured"" yet.

Swaddle at the right age.,
Pay attention to your baby's preferences.,
Don't swaddle if your baby has a medical condition.,
Choose the right blanket.,
Don't swaddle too tightly.,
Always lay swaddled babies on their backs.,
Spread the blanket on a flat, sturdy surface.Make sure it's a surface that is safe for the baby to lie on.,
Fold the top corner toward you.,
Lay the baby on the blanket with the head above the fold.The fold should be resting directly below the infant's neck.,
Pull one side of the blanket across the baby.,
Bring the bottom corner of the blanket up and over the baby's feet.,
Pull the remaining side across the baby.",How to Swaddle," When babies are newborns, being wrapped up in a blanket feels good, because it mimics the feeling of being inside the womb. Babies at this age still aren't very mobile, so they don't mind the feeling of a blanket wrapped around them. The best time to swaddle babies is when they are still infants, before they're able to turn over to their bellies. When your baby is old enough to turn over, it's time to stop swaddling.Babies learn how to flip over from their backs to their bellies at different times. After the first few months, pay careful attention to how much your baby is able to move around within the blanket. If he or she tends to move a lot, it might be time to stop swaddling.;
, Some babies really like the feeling of being swaddled, and you can tell because it calms them when they're upset and helps them go to sleep. Other babies don't like it as much, and will cry and resist the tension of the blanket. While swaddling is a technique that works for many babies, it's not something to force on your child; if your baby seems to prefer being free of the blanket, take it off.

, Since swaddling impedes motion, it can be detrimental to babies with dysplasia, a partial or full dislocation of the hip.If your baby has dysplasia, swaddling isn't recommended. Talk to your doctor about whether swaddling is healthy for your baby if he or she has another type of medical condition.

, A soft, thin blanket the size of a receiving blanket is a good option for swaddling. Larger blankets are too big, leaving too much unused material to create the swaddle properly and creating a suffocation hazard for the child.

, The blanket's tension should be taught, but not tight by any means. Swaddling a baby too tightly can cause him or her to overheat and lead to breathing problems. If you need help figuring out how tight the blanket should be, ask your doctor to demonstrate.

, Never lay a swaddled baby on his or her stomach, and stop swaddling babies once they're able to turn over. The stomach position can increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)., A carpeted floor is a good place. You can also use your lap or a couch, changing table or bed if you are monitoring at all times in order to prevent falls. Position the blanket so that it is a diamond with the bottom point facing you.

, Grasp the point of the corner furthest from you, and pull it down toward the center of the blanket about 8 inches (20.3 cm). Don't pull it all the way to the middle of the blanket. This top fold is where the baby's head will go.

, It's important to make sure the blanket won't cover the baby's mouth and nose.

, Pull a side of the diamond over the baby and tuck the corner underneath his or her body, underneath the arm. This will secure one arm but leave the arm from the side you just secured the blanket under free to move about.

, Make sure the baby's feet have room to move and aren't too confined. If you have excess blanket that would crowd or cover the baby's face, fold the corner down so the fold lands at the baby's chest, or you can wrap the blanket over the baby's shoulder on the unwrapped side.

, Wrap it over the baby and tuck the corner underneath. The swaddle will be as tight and secure as you wrap this last side. Though babies like the womb-like security of being snug in a swaddle, be careful to not make the swaddle so tight it is uncomfortable.

Learn the fussy cry.,
Recognize normal prolonged crying.,
Determine colic crying.,
Recognize abnormal crying.",How to Understand the Cry of Babies," A baby who is ready to be fed is likely to begin crying quietly and slowly. The cry will build in volume, becoming loud and rhythmic. Each individual wail is likely to be short and low-pitched.The cry of hunger is a cue to feed your baby, unless you have fed your baby recently and are certain that your baby does not need more to eat., A baby who is in pain is likely to begin crying suddenly. The cry may be high-pitched and harsh. Each cry will be loud, brief, and piercing. This cry is designed to communicate urgency! If you hear the pain cry, respond immediately. Look for opened diaper pins or snagged fingers. If you see nothing, try soothing the baby. The pain may have passed, and the baby may need comforting.


If your baby has an arched back and hard stomach, the pain cry may be due to gas. Soothe your baby, and hold her upright when nursing to limit stomach gas.If your baby's eye is red, swollen, or tearing, call your doctor. She may have a scratch or something in her eye such as an eyelash, which can cause pain.
In the case of prolonged pain crying, the baby may be sick or injured. Call a doctor if your baby cries more when being held or rocked, especially if you detect a fever.If your baby under three months old has a fever (100.4 °F or 38 °C) call your doctor right away, even if she is not fussy.

, Fussy crying is mild and may start and stop, or go up and down in volume. Fussy crying may increase in volume if you ignore it, so don't hesitate to soothe your baby when he fusses. Fussy crying can communicate discomfort, or it may just mean your baby wants to be held. Babies often fuss at the same time every day, usually late in the afternoon or early in the evening.Babies cry fussily when they want to be held. Newborns may often fuss to be held, as they are used to confined spaces.Check the diaper of a fussing baby. Fussy crying can indicate a wet or soiled diaper.
Check the temperature. Your baby might fuss because he is too hot or too cold.
The fussy cry can mean frustration. A baby may fuss when unable to fall asleep.
The fussy cry can mean that your baby is over-stimulated or under-stimulated. Newborns sometimes cry to shut out stimulation. Try adjusting light source, volume of music, or your baby's position.
Don't worry too much if a newborn does not stop fussing when you soothe him. Some babies fuss at length in the first three months of life., When you have checked for hunger, pain, and discomfort, and have soothed your child, she may continue to cry. Sometimes babies just need to cry, especially in the first three months. Normal prolonged crying sounds like ordinary fussy crying. Your baby may be overly stimulated or have excessive energy.A fantastic resource to help you understand normal prolonged crying is the Period of PURPLE Crying (https://dontshake.org/purple-crying). This program provides materials to help you understand the characteristics of crying in normal, healthy babies.
Normal prolonged crying can last up to five hours per day.

, A baby with colic will cry intensely with no cause. The cry sounds distressed and is often high-pitched. It may sound like your baby's pain cry. Your baby may show signs of physical stress: clenching of the fists, curled up legs, and stomach clenching. Your baby may pass gas or soil his diaper at the end of an episode of colic crying.Colic crying happens at least three hours per day, more than three days per week, for at least three weeks.
Unlike normal prolonged crying, colic crying tends to occur at the same time every day, around the time of normal fussy crying.Try to keep a diary of when your baby cries and for how long if your baby seems to cry a lot. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure if the crying is due to colic or not.
The cause of colic is unknown. There is no proven remedy. Soothe a colicky baby, and hold him upright when nursing to limit stomach gas.Your baby should not cry from colic after three or four months of age. Colic does not have any lasting ill effects on a baby's health or growth.

, Some cries may be telling you that something is seriously wrong. An abnormal cry may be very high-pitched, up to three times as high as your baby's normal cry. It may also be unusually low-pitched. A high or low cry that persists may indicate a severe illness. If your infant is crying in a way that sounds strange to you, call a doctor.


If your baby has been dropped or bumped and is crying abnormally, see a doctor right away.
If your baby is crying abnormally and moving less or eating less than normal, she needs to see a doctor.
Call the doctor if you notice unusual or fast or heavy breathing, or movements your baby does not ordinarily make.
Call an ambulance if your baby is blue in the face, especially the mouth."

Spend time with her.,
Adversely, don't hover.,
Identify problems and try your best to fix whatever they may be.,
Understand that she will still miss her mother.,
Let her be busy.,
Focus on being a father.,


It might seem a bit weird when your daughter starts asking you to play with her Barbie dolls alongside her, but you'll need to get used of it, as this will allow you two to bond.,
Ask for help.,
Talk about her mother.,
Make her laugh.",How to Raise a Girl As a Single Father," Devote some of your time each day especially for her, whether it be watching a movie together or just discussing how she's doing. Your daughter will appreciate the effort and feel more loved by doing this.;
, Your daughter needs her alone time just like you, and will have times where she wants to be in her room or with her friends instead of hanging out with you. The line between concern and hovering is both confusing and vague. You'll encounter difficulty with it- especially during puberty, where your baby girl begins to become an independent young woman. A good rule of thumb to follow is to notice your daughter's cues and encourage her to tell you when she wants to be alone.

, Allow her to see that you're always with her if she ever needs anything. This will give her a sense of security and will also help her to truly feel cared for


It's EXTREMELY important to keep open communication lines with your daughter. It makes things much easier, and allows you to understand, respect, and truly listen to what she's saying. Build a trust filled relationship with her where she can feel safe and inclined to keep up the open communication.

, She most likely won't forget her mother and may even feel sad, lonely, or resentful at times due to this, regardless of your presence. Make sure she knows that you love her and that her mother will always be with her in her heart.


If possible, try to make her mother visit your daughter once a month. If you can't for reasons such as death, try to take into account your daughter's feelings when dating and/or getting married. Your daughter may be adverse to having another lady 'replace' her mother, and resent you for it. Try to show her that while no one will ever replace her previous mother, this new lady will allow you both to create new experiences and memories that you'll both enjoy.
Don't try to make her forget about her mother. No one can ever truly forget about their mother, and it will make you look like you don't really care about her by trying to do so.

, Your job isn't only to be a father now, your job is to keep her from being lonely or sad because of her lack of mother. Make her live her life as a normal person. Let her do anything that would make her stop thinking about her mother, and keep her busy. Try making her start practicing a sport she likes or whatever she wants.


Sometimes, sports isn't enough to make her start thinking about something else. Let her see that you still care about her while keeping her busy. Going camping, mountain climbing (if she is old enough), or even a simple trip should make her like you more.

, As a father, your job is to care for your child whether it's with a mother or not. Understand that girls need tons of things. Find a job with a good salary if you haven't yet, and buy the things she needs. As a single father, your job now is not only to provide for her, but also teach her about finances and how to be a smart consumer so she'll be able to make better money making decisions later in life.

, So be prepared to play with dolls, brush her hair, dress up, play pretend, have tea parties, etc...
Raise your girl as if she had been raised by two. Understand how to raise a child, and keep on doing what you need to do. Remember: Your daughter will eventually emulate you, so make sure to display good habits, values, and morals

, Sometimes you won't understand your daughter since you're a male. Don't hesitate to ask for assistance and advice from your family, friends, or even a babysitter. Start reading books about raising children and skip the parts about the mother, or read books that is about how to raise a girl if you're a single father. Search on the internet for how-to articles about that, and start learning from others' experiences.


Avoid getting a babysitter. Your daughter might not enjoy that idea. Before doing anything that would make her daily life different, ask her what she thinks about it. However, don't do everything she asks. Think over her requests carefully before doing anything.

, She will always remind her mother, so when you talk about her, it might make her feel better even if it look like that it won't. Start telling her that her mother would be very happy if she stopped being sad about her, and continued her life happily.


Keep on telling her that her mother loves her. Make your daughter stop worrying stop thinking she's in distress or not proud of her.

, Sometimes, your daughter may hide away her true feelings to appease you. It's up to you to break her of this habit ASAP. Encourage your daughter to be honest with her emotions, whatever they may be, and show her that she doesn't need to pretend. One of the best ways to do this is through making her TRULY laugh/smile... whether that be through watching a funny movie, telling corny jokes, or surprising her with a hug. (Or allowing her to cry if she needs to.)


Let yourself smile, too. Your daughter will never be happy if she realizes that you aren't. It's natural to be nervous about being an only parent, but don't let that fear overwhelm you. Smile, laugh, and live as much as any other person, if not more- you do, after all, have an amazing daughter by your side.

Listen for a loud cry, almost a wail.,
Check for a forced and whiny cry.,
Listen for a persistent high-pitched cry.,
Check for a pausing cry.,
Listen for a soft, staccato cry.,
Recognize the colicky cry.",How to Know Why a Child (Under 2) Is Crying1," This usually means “I'm in pain” or “I'm sick.” The baby will pause, then scream an entire lungful, and repeat the process. It's persistent, piercing, and unmistakable. If you hear this cry, go to the child immediately. Take their temperature to check for a fever. Check if they're arching their back or thrashing, which also signals pain.


Babies will also make this kind of cry after a recent vaccination. Check the injection area for swelling or other irritation not included in the normal side effects.Babies normally won't make a painful cry if they're teething or just trying to pass gas. In situations like these, they'll be more fussy than anything else.;
, This is a cry of discomfort or annoyance, as opposed to flat-out pain. Babies in this state often punctuate their cries in an “uh-uh-uh” pattern. They'll also wrinkle their noses, squeeze their eyes closed, and thrash their hands.Dirty diapers, the ambient temperature, and the texture of the child's clothing are just a few causes of the annoyed/uncomfortable cry., This is the telltale sign of hunger. Hungry babies also wiggle and make sucking motions with their mouths.Babies who fall asleep before the end of their meals might get hungry less than 90 minutes later.Overfed babies will cry because they're uncomfortable from their bloated stomachs. They'll usually utter the whiny and forced cry of discomfort. Spitting up is a telltale sign that they've had too much., This often means ""I'm tired."" The baby will cry, get distracted, and start back up again. Sleepy babies might have their eyes closed while they cry. They could also rub their eyes, which usually makes them red and puffy., This can often signal boredom or overstimulation. Babies uttering this cry will sometimes switch over to laughing or shrieking. They'll also try to avoid the object that's boring/overstimulating them by pushing it away or directing their attention somewhere else., Babies who have colic make high-pitched, dramatic cries for no apparent reason. They'll usually do this for at least three hours each day, at the same time everyday, and for at least three weeks. Babies usually develop colic when they're three weeks old and outgrow it between the ages of three and four months. Other symptoms of colic include:

Stomach bloating
Gas from swallowing too much air
Clenched fists
Reddened face"
"
Seek medical attention.,
Feed a hungry baby.,
Change their diaper.,
Provide white noise for a bored or overstimulated baby.,
Find out what's annoying them.,
Let them cry it out.",How to Know Why a Child (Under 2) Is Crying2," Do this if you hear a sick or painful cry accompanied by a fever, rash, bruise, or other sign of illness/injury. Call your doctor immediately. Tell them the baby's symptoms and follow their instructions about caring for the child. If it's during regular working hours, ask if they could squeeze you in between other patients. If it's after hours, you might have to meet them at the emergency room.

For minor problems, such as post-vaccination soreness, try giving the baby a pacifier., Babies get hungry more often than adults do, about every two to four hours. After about three months, you should have your routine down.Make sure they get a full meal, which is usually 2-4 fl. oz. (59-118 mL) of breastmilk or formula. They'll usually pull away from their food source when they're full. Depending on the baby's age, this could be anywhere from 10 to 40 minutes.When feeding is over, take the baby on your shoulder and slowly move your palm over the baby's back from neck to buttocks. Do this several times until they burp, indicating that the milk has gone down into the stomach and they've expelled gas. This also prevents gassy stomach discomfort.

, While many babies cry after they've soiled their diapers, some don't. However, whether they're uncomfortable/annoyed or just chilling, let your nose be your guide. If it smells funky, change the diaper immediately. Urine and/or feces can cause diaper rash if a dirty diaper is left on too long. Female babies can get infections if fecal matter enters their vaginas., You could run a vacuum cleaner, if you think the sound won't trigger even more crying. Some quieter alternatives are a white noise machine or an oscillating fan. You might also try running warm water over the baby's hands and feet to calm them down., If you're baby is making the uncomfortable/annoyed cry, check their immediate surroundings. Maybe they don't like the texture of the blanket brushing their face. Perhaps they're outgrowing the clothes they're wearing. Feel their exposed skin. If it's cold, cover them with a blanket or hat.Get a quick whiff to see if they need a diaper change., Once you're fluent in crying, you'll know when and how to act. If you constantly run to a baby's side at the slightest cry, they'll be able to trick you when they really don't need attention. Sometimes, it helps to keep your distance and let them cry it out, especially if they're just sleepy.This is also a good option if the baby has colic, and you're feeling frustrated. Angry adults sometimes shake babies, leading to long-term injuries or even death. Calmly put the baby down and leave the room (although you should stay within earshot).Do not let the child cry for too long, as this may cause the child distress.You can ease the crying without staying right next to them. For example, placing the child in a self-rocking chair may help relax them.

Decode arm-tugging.,
Look for pointing.,
Listen for basic words.,
Imitate what the toddler does and build on it.,
Teach them simple words.,
Find alternate ways of communicating.",How to Know Why a Child (Under 2) Is Crying3," Rather than resisting the child, allow them to guide you to their intended destination. They could be using memories of your past actions to tell you they want something. For example, if they pull you toward the fridge or food cabinet, they could want something to eat. After you open the door, you're left with the process of elimination. Show them different foods they can eat and see how they react., Before children learn to speak, they point toward things in in general directions that relate to their crying. Follow the direction of their finger. Like arm-tugging, pointing could indicate something the child wants. For example, if they point toward the toy chest, they probably want something to play with., By the age of one, many children have mastered a limited vocabulary of simple words. While they're crying, listen for these words. They might be trying to communicate what they want. For example, if they yell or whine, “No!” while you try to help them with their puzzle, they might be seeking independence. If, after searching the room, they say “Teddy,” maybe they're looking for the stuffed animal you just put in the toy chest., At first, toddlers' use of gestures and non-verbal sounds is limited. Imitate what the child does, but teach them to use their gestures and/or sounds in different contexts. This will help them to communicate their feelings and desires without crying.For example, if the child only points at something they want, like a toy or a snack, teach them to point at whatever triggered their unhappiness. If they stub their toe on the coffee table, they can point to it to explain that it's the reason they're in pain.

, Toddlers are sponges for language-learning, so this is the best time to expand their vocabulary. Start with words and phrases you use often. These words and phrases will be familiar to the child and easy for them to understand.Some good choices include “happy,” “sad,” “mad,” and “tired.” Use these words in the correct context to help the child to understand them. This will make asking what's wrong much easier as time passes. For example:If you yawn and lie down on the couch, look at the child and say, “Tired.”
If you're watching a movie scene that includes someone yelling, point to that character and say, “Mad.”

, It can sometimes be difficult for a parent to understand baby talk. If your child is still not able to express themselves fully with words, there are other ways of communicating with them.

Use visuals, and have your child point to what they want or need. You can hold up objects or use images on a picture that they can gesture towards.
Some babies can learn basic hand signs before they are able to speak. You can teach your child a few signs to help them express what they want.

Prepare yourself.,
Talk to other children.,

Encourage learning and curiosity.,
Encourage healthy habits.,
Set aside specific times to work with your kids.,
Use discipline appropriately.,
Allow the child to play.",How to Raise a Brilliant Child," This simply involves salubrious priming of conventions. A well prepared ""teacher/instructor"" will be competent in all perspectives - do some research into parenthood and child development, before you have your own.;
, Get to know your friends' and relatives' kids to help prepare yourself for parenthood. By doing so, you will be able to understand their interests, what they find fun, and how to interact with them. Just keep in mind that all children are different!

, Ask questions from the folks who have been through it before. No two children and no two families are alike, but that doesn't mean you can't learn form the experiences of others.

, On a daily basis, from a young age, teach your child to love learning. Get excited with them, teach them new skills, and explore phenomenons they find interesting. As they get older, use brain teasers and exercises that pique their interest. Children are naturally creative and inquisitive - use this to your advantage.

, Children need sleep, they need to eat well, and they need daily exercise.

, This time should be for reading/learning.


Encourage your child to love learning. Make it fun.
Teach your child to read; this will be a basic source of encouragement. He will never forget the encouragement.
Help children learn. The child will see you as a role model. Your child will grow not only from the new knowledge but also from your time spent with them.

, Every parent and family needs to work out their own reinforcement and discipline techniques. Whatever approaches you take, be consistent, and do not adjust too much based on exceptions or daily situations. Children thrive on consistency and will respond to it.

, Creative play does wonders for enhancing cognitive skills and building on children's natural curiosity.


Limit the playing of video games. Video games can be addicting, and they're not all beneficial for development. Instead create manual field games and encourage social interactions and artistic endeavors.

Pull out the comfort object when your baby appears anxious or upset.,
Let your baby sleep with their comfort object.,
Try other ways of keeping your baby calm.",How to Manage Your Baby's Attachment to Comfort Objects1," To help manage your baby’s attachment to their comfort object, you may try only pulling out the comfort object when your baby appear anxious or upset. This may be when your baby is crying or getting fussy or, in older kids, what looks more like anger – whining, clinging, or acting out. You may also let your baby have their comfort object when they are ill or feeling sick.Try to keep the comfort object nearby or close to you whenever you are with your baby. That way, you can easily pull it out and present it to your baby when they are anxious or distressed.;
, Many parents recommend letting your baby sleep with their comfort object, as it can help them feel safe and calm enough to go to sleep. You may position the comfort object in your baby’s crib or sleeping area so they can hold it and see it.This is especially helpful in getting your child used to sleeping at specific times, as over time it signals to their brains that it's time to get sleepy.
If you want to try to get your baby to rely less on their comfort object to sleep, you may try only letting your baby have access to the comfort object when they sleep at night. Remove the comfort object from their sleeping area for naps during the day and see if they notice.
If your baby starts to get fussy or is unable to sleep during naps because their comfort object is not close by, it is okay to give your baby their comfort object.

, You can manage your baby’s attachment to their comfort object by trying to get out of the habit of depending on the object during tense situations with your baby. You may try other tactics for calming your baby when they are upset or fussy, such as using comforting words, carrying them in your arms, or rocking them in a rocking chair. Older children may respond better to distraction techniques, such as using other toys to get them to calm down.You may try viewing the comfort object as the last resort to getting your baby to calm down. If your baby has other caretakers, such as family or friends, instruct them to only give your baby their comfort object once they have tried other ways of calming them down.

Try to limit your baby’s comfort objects to one or two items.,
Have two of the same comfort object for your baby.,
Keep the comfort object clean.",How to Manage Your Baby's Attachment to Comfort Objects2," Another way you can manage your baby’s attachment to comfort objects is to limit how many objects they have access to at one time. Perhaps you only allow your baby to have one comfort object at a time and get them to focus their attentions on this one object. Or perhaps you allow your baby to have two comfort objects, a main object and a backup object.For example, you may let your baby use a stuffed bear as a comfort object and remove other objects that could be comfort objects from their space. Or you may allow your baby to have a stuffed bear as a main comfort object and a blanket as a backup comfort object.
You can explore the concept of ""toy rotation"" by limiting the number toys the child has access to and switching them every few weeks. This helps stimulate kids’ brains, fosters imagination, and can keep them from getting attached to too many objects.

, Whatever object your baby gravitates towards for comfort, you should make sure you have two of that object. Try not to let your baby use a limited edition bear or a one of a kind plush toy for comfort, as this may leave you stuck if something happens to that object.Go for an object that is easy to replace and keep a backup of the same item so your baby is never without their comfort object when they need it. Then, label the object with your name and phone number, so it can be returned if lost.
For example, you may encourage your baby to use a plush toy that you can buy cheaply at a store nearby as a comfort object. Or you may make two comfort blankets for your baby and make sure the backup blanket is accessible so you can give it to your baby if necessary.

, One big concern parents have about their baby’s comfort object is keeping the object clean and hygienic. You may need to limit your baby’s access to the comfort object out of necessity, as it will need to be washed and cleaned at some point. You may plan to wash the object while your baby is sleeping or distracted with other objects so they do not notice and do not get upset.You may also rely on the backup comfort object when you are washing your baby’s main comfort object. Give your baby the backup while the other one is being washed.

"
"
Remove your baby’s comfort objects from their space gradually.,
Encourage your baby to view the comfort object in a different way.,
Accept that your baby is attached to their comfort object.",How to Manage Your Baby's Attachment to Comfort Objects3," To ease your baby’s reliance on comfort objects, you may try removing them from their space over time. Start by removing one of your baby’s comfort objects and notice if they get upset or bothered. If they do not seem to notice, you may continue to remove more of their comfort objects until they are left with one to two objects.Be mindful about this process. Don’t throw the objects out, as you might want to utilize them later. But you should be sure not to place them somewhere your child will find them on his/her own, as regression can occur and they may cling to the object even more.
This process may be done over a longer period of time as your baby grows up. For example, you may allow your baby to have several comfort objects when they are eight to twelve months. At the twelve month mark, you may try removing several comfort objects until your baby has only one to two. Then, at the sixteen month mark, you may try reducing your baby’s comfort items to just one.

, When your baby is very young, it may be difficult for you to encourage them to view the comfort object in any way but an item they need close by. As your baby gets older, you may be able to get them to view the comfort item as something that stays in their room or their sleeping area. This way, the comfort item does not need to go everywhere with your baby and can be limited to one space.For example, when your baby is older, you may tell them that their comfort object lives in their bedroom. You may say, “Your bear lives in your bedroom and needs to sleep while you go to daycare. She will be in your bedroom when you come back from daycare and you can play with her then.”

, Though you may worry that your baby is too attached to their comfort object, remember that it is completely normal for your baby to have one. As a parent, you may find it easier to let your baby rely on their comfort object, especially when they are upset or anxious. This is an accepted practice among parents and can be healthy for your baby’s development.Comfort objects help children bridge the gap between the familiar and the unknown and between dependency and self-sufficiency. Many experts think comfort objects represent the child's parent and helps them slowly ease into being away from them.
If you are unsure if your baby has too much of a reliance on their comfort object, you may want to speak to your pediatrician or gynecologist about the issue. They may be able to provide some guidance and help you monitor your baby’s behavior to ensure it is normal.

, Using oil is not a requirement for baby massage. However, if you want to use it, make sure to use an oil that will be safe for your baby.

Consider cold pressed, unscented vegetable or fruit oils.Examples of oils include olive, sunflower, safflower, or grapeseed. These are safe to ingest, odorless, and are beneficial to the skin.
Oil may help reduce friction and make the massage process easier. However, the oil may be messy, so take precautions to contain the mess.

Flex your baby’s limbs.,
Massage the belly.,
Move to the back and head.",How to Massage Your Infant2," A good place to start the massage is on your baby’s lower body. Begin by massaging the soles of the feet.

Don't expect perfection.,
Show your child unconditional love.,
Reverse your child's negative self-talk.",How to Raise a Physically Confident Child1," Many children find physical activities fun to begin with. Let your child enjoy physical activities or games without pressuring them. For example, if your child loves to run, avoid organizing the activity or making them run for a certain amount of time each day.


If your child enjoys physical activity, they'll become more confident about their own physical abilities.;
, Your child may become physically frustrated if they think that they're not good enough. It's important to let your child see that no one is perfect at everything and that they should try and practice. A good way to do this is to let your child see you try something new. Let your child know if you're struggling and let them see you stick with it.For example, you might make a habit of putting on a yoga program and letting your child watch you learn the poses. Your child will see that you have to learn and practice physical skills.

, Kids are exposed to a lot of physical expectations, whether from watching professional athletes or from making the team at school. Show your child that everyone is unique and that people have different physical capabilities. Avoid talking badly about yourself in front of your kids which could signal a negative physical attitude. Instead, talk to your child about any body image concerns they have.For example, instead of saying, ""I'm too old to run that fast,"" you could say, ""I need to take it a little slower.""
If you notice the child struggling with their body image, talk with them about why they're not confident. Explain that everybody has physical differences and abilities.

, Show your child that you're pleased and proud when they try a new physical challenge or keep trying to learn a new skill. If you only show praise when they compete and win, they will only feel physical pressure. Instead, accept that your child might not be the best at their sport or activity, but let them know that you want them to enjoy it.


For example, you might say, ""I know you've really been sticking with soccer practice. I'm proud of how much effort you've been putting into it.""
It's important for your child to try new physical challenges. If you expect perfection, they may be less likely to try new things because they fear failure. If you just encourage them to do new activities for the sake of it, they may find something they love doing.

, Your child should know without a doubt that you care more for their personality and passions than their physical abilities. Avoid focusing on their physical strengths or challenges and instead talk with them about their interests.For example, instead of saying, ""I can't believe you don't even want to try playing basketball,"" say, ""I know we talked about you doing an organized sport. What would you really like to play?""

, If you know your child has a negative opinion about their physical appearance or abilities, ask them why they have these negative thoughts. Remind your child that their thoughts affect how they feel about themselves. Instead of focusing on a fear or criticism, have your child look focus on a helpful thought.For example, you might say, ""I heard you say you'll never have friends because of how you look. Remember that your true friends shouldn't care how you look and you shouldn't have to change yourself for a

Pay attention to the way the name will sound.,
Choose a name of the right length.,
Check how it will look written.,
Give older siblings input.",How to Choose a Middle Name1," A middle name can be used in all kinds of different ways: to pay tribute to a family name, to reference a creative or personal element of the child's history, but whatever you're considering as a middle name you must make sure that it sounds good to say. When you've settled on the middle and last names for your child, practice saying the middle name with it to make sure it sounds correct, it sounds good, and is easy to say.


Choose a middle name that begins with a different vowel sound than the last syllable of the first name. Names like Angela Anne or Denice Savannah are somewhat difficult to say, because the repetition of vowel sounds at the end of words end up sounding jumbled in the mouth.
Try using consonant sounds that aren't pronounced in the forename. Lena Grey or George Randolph or Thomas Stearns sound nice together because we get a full range of different sounds.;
, If you have chosen on a longer first name, choose a shorter middle name like Alexandra Grace or Christopher Owen. If you've chosen a shorter first name, you've got room for a longer missile name: Kate Elizabeth or Ross Anthony.


Count the syllables of the names to help you get a quick reference. If you've got a first name of two or fewer, use a middle name of two or three syllables.

, Write out names that you're considering and try to see if they'll look attractive written out, if they'll be easy to pronounce, and will represent your child well in the world. A good name should look good on paper and sound great in the ear. It can also be a fun exercise to imagine your kid's name written out, imagining their signature on the world.

, One excellent way of easing the transition of a new child into your family can be to give the older sibling or siblings input in the choosing of the middle name. If they're old enough to understand the choice, give your other kids a chance to help choose the name. You could either present them with a list of choices all of which you're happy with, and then let them choose, which will help you avoid having a child named Brian Robot. Choosing together can help bring the family close.


Alternatively, let the kids experiment and come up with their own list. Maybe the kids will come up with unique, strange, creative names you'd never have thought up. Maybe Steven Velociraptor is the perfect name? Well, the choice is still up to you.

Find out whether it is a boy or a girl.,
Select the arrangement.,
Consider other elements of the arrangement.,
Add accessories.,
Build on a theme.,
Be a caring husband.",How to Choose Flowers for a New Baby," Asking whether the new arrival is a boy or a girl is a good place to start. For the traditionalist, this will mean a choice of blue or pink flowers - or even a mixture of both if celebrating the birth of boy and girl twins! Of course, don't let convention hold you back in your choice of colours. Gerberas in primary colours, or a white and green combo of lilac and ruscus, are also very effective in new baby bouquets. In the case of a seriously premature or sick baby, it might be prudent to hold off sending an arrangement until the baby is in good health.;
, The florist will be open to any floral preferences you may have, but will also be happy to suggest suitable seasonal flowers.


For a pink arrangement, consider such flowers as:

Stargazer lilies
Bouvardia
Lisianthus
Sweet akito rose
Ruscus
Cymbidium orchid


For a true blue arrangement, consider such flowers as:

Flox
Freesia
Thistles
Hyacinth



, The next choice will be whether you want an arrangement in a container or a bouquet. Flowers either in a basket or ceramic pot are a practical option for busy new mothers. Another attractive option is to present a potted plant, like a miniature rose, as a gift - whilst marking the baby's birth, it will also mark the baby's growth.

, New baby floral arrangements are all about accessorizing. This is an opportunity to introduce a bit of your own style into the gift. Accessories range from balloons accompanying the arrangement, to teddy bears and sweets.

, A few decades ago feathery storks with flowers were all the rage. The current trend is to send 'Pampers Hampers'. These are floral gifts accompanied by a basket of useful baby products.

, For the fathers only - presenting your wife with an elegant bunch of roses following the birth of your baby is a lovely touch. She may worry about resembling a beached whale, but a gesture like this will make her feel like a princess!

Offer a variety of things to play with.,
Give your child lots of free playtime.,
Let your child explore.,
Give your child a pep talk.,
Consider your child's interests.,
Discuss peer pressure with your child.",How to Raise a Physically Confident Child2," Children enjoy playing with different things so give your child several types of toys and equipment to play with. This way, your child can explore and learn about what things they enjoy interacting with. Your child might also discover what physical skills they have. You might offer balls, hoops, climbing structures, and jump ropes.


For example, your child might find that they don't enjoy jumping rope, but that they're good at playing basketball. Finding something they like to do will help their self-esteem.

, Children need to challenge themselves in order to find their limits. Instead of overwhelming your child with lots of organized sports, just let your child play and explore. This will also help your child determine what they enjoy doing and might want to pursue later.Your child doesn't have to be playing a game to get physical activity. Your child might enjoy just walking the dog or running around the yard.

, It can be difficult to watch your child taking risks, but it's important for your child to try new, challenging things. Give your child the space to try and learn without interference. If you don't step in and tell your child what they can and can't do, they'll learn their own physical capabilities. For example, if your child wants to rock climb, you're going to have to let them find their own footing.If your child is scared to take physical risks, encourage them to start small and work their way up to face their fear. They'll feel a sense of accomplishment.

, If you suspect that your child is feeling discouraged or lonely, remind the child that they're not alone. Let them know that everyone has physical strengths and challenges to overcome. By talking to your child, you can create a nurturing environment where they feel comfortable to talk with you.You can also ask your child's teachers or coaches to talk with them. Sometimes hearing encouraging words from others will make them feel supported.
For example, you might say, ""I know that you're disappointed that you didn't make the team. I'm proud of you for trying out and I think there are other activities that you'd be even better at.""

, If your child doesn't like physical activity, it may be because they haven't found the sport or activity they enjoy. Young children (under six years old) often lack the skills needed to play organized sports, so try to let them develop basic skills through playing. If your child is older, ask them if they'd like to play a group sport or if they'd rather do an individual activity.It may take some time to find what your child likes to do. Just be patient and keep talking with your child. Avoid forcing your child to do any physical activity that they don't want to do.

, If your child is feeling pressured or influenced to do something they don't want to do, they should know how to respond to their peers. Teach your child several ways to say no, let them know you support them, and remind your child that they have other friends that don't pressure them.For example, you could say, ""I know you're feeling like you have to dress the same way as the most popular kids in class, but if that won't make you happy, then you shouldn't. Your real friends won't force you to be someone you're not.""

Avoid negative talk about food.,
Offer nutritious foods to your child.,
Never shame your child.,
Talk with your child about weight gain.",How to Raise a Physically Confident Child3," Your child will pay attention to criticisms you make about food and weight, even if you're being negative to yourself. Instead of making negative comments that can worry your child, create a positive association with food.For example, instead of saying, ""I really shouldn't eat anymore or I'll get fat,"" say, ""I really enjoyed that dessert, but I think I'll wait before having more.""
If your child wants to diet or refuses to eat, you should talk with your child's doctor.

, Encourage your child to make healthy decisions about their diet and well-being. Rather than monitor everything your child eats, make a variety of healthy foods available to your child. You should also set out healthy snacks for your child to eat in between meals.If you know your child is struggling with their weight, take a break from buying or making treats or foods that offer little nutritional value. Instead, ensure that you get your child's favorite healthy foods.

, If your child feels that you're being critical of their appearance and eating habits, their physical confidence will suffer. If your child suspects that you aren't satisfied with their physical appearance or weight, they could lose their trust in you, develop an eating disorder, or experience emotional distress.If you're supportive and encouraging of your child, they'll feel they can come to you if they're anxious about their appearance or weight.

, As your child develops, they'll probably gain a little weight. This is especially true if your child is going through puberty. If you notice your child eating less or becoming concerned about their weight, talk with them. Let them know that gaining weight is a normal part of growing and developing.For example, you might say, ""I've noticed that you're not eating your favorite foods anymore. Is anything troubling you?"" If your child says their weight is worrying them, you can say, ""As long as you're healthy and growing, you shouldn't let your weight worry you.""

Consider choosing a family name.,
Use a name from your religious or cultural heritage.,
Choose a classic or historical name that's out of favor.,
Use the birth month or other coincidental.",How to Choose a Middle Name2," One of the most common ways of selecting a middle name involves using it as an opportunity to pay tribute to a close member of your family. Choosing a grandparent's first name as the middle name for your child can be a great and moving way of paying tribute to your forebears.


You can go recent into your family tree, or you can go way back. Look at a genealogy report and find distant relatives for interesting and unusual historical names that are part of your lineage.
If someone is giving up their last name as part of a marriage, it's also common to use that name as the middle name for a child.

, The middle name can be an excellent opportunity to select something spiritually or culturally significant, giving your child a sense of history and significance. Naming a child after your favorite saint, martyr, cultural icon, or other religious figure from your tradition can lend a gravitas to a name.


Think of names that are significant to sharpening your view of the world and your own morality. Pop culture names are perfectly applicable, especially if they sound good. If Johnny Cash means a lot to you, naming a child Carter Cash might be a great way of paying tribute.

, It's sometimes popular to use the middle name as an opportunity to go way back and choose a retro or historical name that's less common than common names. Names like ""Rosemary"" or ""Orville"" are unusual in digital age, which might make them excellent and unique names to pick for the middle of your child's name.


Go through old romantic novels from 100 years ago and check out the names. Keep a running list to go by and experiment with to see how you like older names.

, Use a coincidental word or name at the last minute to give your child a middle name. This can be an excellent way of using chance and coincidence to pick a name, which can actually be quite unique and moving for some people. Use the month the child is born to pick the middle name, like Alex June or Christian May. You could also use the day on which the child is born: Jacob Wednesday or Christa Monday.


Consider using the town in which the parents met as the middle name. Names like Joshua Brooklyn or Mary Paris can have a nice ring to them, as well as a reminder of roots.
Consider naming them after a significant noun during the day the child is born. If you drove to the hospital in your old, beat-up Volvo, a car that's gotten you through some rough times, consider picking ""Volvo"" as a middle name. If it means something, it's not wrong.

Do no harm.,
Make sure the initials don't spell anything inadvertently embarrassing or crude.,
Don't tell people the name once you've settled.,
Use the correct spelling of common names.",How to Choose a Middle Name3," In a world with more than 7 billion people, almost all of whom have names, originality is plenty desirable. But there's something to be said for an old classic, especially if you're considering naming your child Crystal Shanda Leer or Justin Time. Try to resist the urge to make jokes, choosing goofy names that'll stick your kid with a lame middle name for the rest of their life. Pick something sincere, something meaningful, and something creative, not a one-liner.

, Francis Underwood Kensington sounds like a nice name until the monogrammed towels come in. Just as you need to make sure the name looks nice spelled out, the name should also look appropriate when shortened into initials.

, So, you've got it locked in: Joshua Corey is the perfect, most meaningful, best-sounding name you've got. Then you let the name slip to a coworker or a friend, who scrunches up their face and tells you a sob story about a terrible high school boyfriend named Corey who was a horrible person. Now suddenly you feel like it's a bad name. Great.


If you love a name, keep it to yourself and ignore other people's ""feedback,"" none of which should affect the way you pick a name. If you want to tell a few select people while you're considering names, that can be great, but if you're totally settled on a name, don't give yourself the chance to stress after the fact.
Your parents, a very close friend might be able to help you go over your choices, but they might give you unsolicited associations with the name that'll change the way you feel. If you do share the name, let people know that you don't need to hear about other people named ""Corey,"" or whatever name you choose.

, If you like the way a name sounds, spell it the way it's spelled, don't replace letters with ""similar"" letters and expect that people will pronounce it the same. If you want people to pronounce ""Angela,"" you can't spell it ""Anjeeleh."" There are pronunciation rules, and breaking them is frustrating for everyone. It's spelled that way for a reason.


Some parents think this helps to give a signature flare to an otherwise common name, but it's far more important to pick the right name, not a goofy spelling of a traditional name. ""Anjeeleh"" should be pronounced differently than ""Angela,"" because it's spelled differently. There's a line between ""unique"" and ""ridiculous,"" and you don't want to cross it with bad spelling.

Teach your children about personal space.,
Teach that it is never okay for people to hurt others.,
Enforce your child's right to set boundaries.,
Applaud your child for setting boundaries.,
Talk about secrets.,
Discuss privacy.",How to Protect Your Children from Child Abuse1," Explain that sometimes people don't want to be touched, and this is normal and okay. If they don't want to be touched, they have the right to say no and have that respected. If someone else wants not to be touched, they must listen to it.


This applies to more innocent forms of touching: poking, hugging, roughhousing, hand-holding, et cetera. Your child can generalize and will understand that less innocent forms of touching also require clear consent.
This can be taught in playtime. For example, if there is a mean doll, you can have a nice doll say ""please leave me alone"" and ""I don't want to be touched"" to the mean doll.;
, Hitting, pulling hair, kicking, biting, pushing, et cetera are not okay because they hurt others. Be firm with your child if they do this, and be firm with anyone who tries to do it to your child or someone else. Explain that if they see someone doing this to them or someone else, it is not okay and they can tell an adult about it.


Horseplay is natural for kids. If this happens, remind them to be gentle and that they need to stop if the other person wants them to stop. This enforces the difference between consensual roughhousing (e.g. contact sports) and non-consensual abuse (e.g. hitting someone who wants to be left alone).

, Your child will start learning how to speak up and set boundaries. Let your child try it first, and if they struggle with it or the other person disregards them, step in to reinforce what your child wants.


For example, ""Stella, stop playing with Mariana's hair. She asked you twice to stop it, and you need to respect that.""
Let your child choose whether they want to be hugged, kissed, or held by others. If they say no and are ignored, make it clear that you expect others to respect the no. ""Nana, I'm teaching George about bodily autonomy and setting boundaries. If he says he doesn't like kisses on the cheek, then please don't kiss him on the cheek.""
Don't let your child violate others' boundaries either. Tell them to stop if you see them doing it.

, ""Good job telling your brother what you wanted"" and ""Thanks for telling me that you don't like to be hugged while you're eating"" let your child know that it's a good thing to say how they feel.

, Your child will be told secrets, tell secrets to others, and keep secrets. Explain that whether a secret should be kept depends on whether one way or another will cause harm. A secret should not be kept if keeping the secret means someone will be hurt. Here are some examples to give them:


If your friend says he is mad at his sister, this is not a good idea to repeat. Keeping the secret won't hurt anybody, while telling people might hurt the sister. The friend and his sister should work it out with each other.
If a friend stops eating because she says she is fat and ugly, you should tell someone. If no one finds out, she could get very sick and hurt, so it's good to tell an adult to keep the friend safe.
If an adult says creepy things that make you uncomfortable, and says to keep it a secret, tell someone. You could get hurt by the creepy adult, and she could hurt other kids too.

, Make it a house rule to knock before entering bedrooms and bathrooms. Let your child figure out whether they want to dress and undress in privacy (if they are old enough to dress themselves). If they change their minds and want privacy when they didn't before, make it clear that others need to respect this.


Some siblings are okay with changing together, while others aren't. Tell them that it's up to both of them, and if one doesn't want to, then it mustn't happen.

Decide what furniture pieces you need.,
Set a budget.,
Shop around.,
Consider matching sets.,
Buy used furniture with caution.,
Consider tipping hazards for dressers and drawers.,
Ask other parents for advice.,
Check for safety recalls before and after buying.",How to Buy Nursery Furniture1," Not every nursery is the same, and each will be customized to fit the individual family. Take the size of the room into consideration as well as the needs of the infant and her caregivers. At a minimum you will likely need to purchase a crib and mattress for the nursery.;
, Nursery furniture can be very expensive, therefore it’s important to research the cost of individual pieces and create a reasonable budget for furnishing the nursery. For example, cribs and changing tables will each cost anywhere from $100 to $1000.

, It’s important to identify merchants from whom you can purchase nursery furniture – whether online or at a brick and mortar store – before jumping feet first into a furniture-buying frenzy. Visit a couple of stores in your hometown and take some time to explore online merchant options., Oftentimes you will spend less money overall if you purchase a matching set of furniture. Buying all the pieces together in a set could be a smarter budget move than buying individual pieces.

, While it may be more budget friendly, you must heed to caution when thinking about purchasing used nursery furniture. Make sure you check for wear and tear, loose or missing components, and protrusions such as screws or bolts that could pose a safety hazard.


You should never buy a used crib.

, Your baby won’t always be so small and once he or she begins to stand and walk, drawers on changing tables and dressers can present safety hazards if the child pulls on them. If you choose furniture with drawers make sure you keep the drawers closed and child-proofed.Make sure you anchor dressers to the wall to prevent tipping.

, Talk to friends, family, and neighbors about their experiences with nursery furniture. They will have suggestions on what pieces worked for them, what to avoid, and where to shop.

, Prior to making a purchase, research any safety recalls on individual pieces or manufacturers. Once you purchase your nursery furniture, it is important that you stay up to date on any recalls for the pieces you purchased. You can get information on recalls from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission."

Eating is pretty much a new infants favorite way to spend ""awake time"".,
Dirtying up diapers is the result of all that eating!,
Bathing an infant everyday is not necessary.,
Umbilical cord care is an often unpleasant but necessary task with newborns.,
Toys are not necessary to newborn infants as they cannot see far and have little interest in anything but people and faces.,
Infant massage and skin to skin time are important bonding times when caring for an infant.,
Sleep is important for both new parents and new babies.",How to Care for Infants," Newborns grow very quickly and have a need to consume milk, either from a breast or bottle, to help support and sustain that growth. Breastmilk or formula is a choice each parent should make before a newborn arrives so they can be prepared with the appropriate knowledge and equipment that will be needed to feed a newborn. Make sure to ask the nursing staff or a lactation consultant if you need help feeding your infant before leaving the hospital.;
, Plus, it's a good indication that your infant is getting enough nutrients and formula. Each baby should have about 8-10 wet and/or dirty diapers a day through the first six weeks of life. After about six to eight weeks you may see this decrease to between 4-6 wet diapers a day, and some baby's may only have a bowel movement once every week or two! Make sure you are prepared with some diapers before your newborn arrives; pull them out of the pack and familiarize yourself with the way the diaper goes on and closes. Be prepared for ""accidents"" when your still getting use to changing your baby.

, Since most newborns do not get down on the floor and crawl around in dirt, bathing is not essential to everyday care. However, it is a good idea to give your infant a wipe down (especially in the diaper area and under chin/neck folds) just to ensure baby is clean and sanitary. A gentle bath at night before bed may help an infant relax and sleep better.

, Each time you change a baby's diaper you should use a cotton swab or ball to cleanse around the umbilical cord. Be careful not to pull or tug on the umbilical cord as this could force it to come off before has healed into a belly button. Also, when you are cleaning the umbilical area, be sure to watch for unusual discharge or blood as this may indicate an infection or tear. By the time your baby is two months old, this will fall off and you won't have to worry about it anymore!

, If you want to buy toys for your infant, pick things that are contrasting, like a soft black and white block with some red on it, as colors are very hard for newborns to make out.

, As a parent, you want to do all you can to make your baby feel safe, secure, and loved, so take some time out of the day to rub your baby down with lotion or hold him/her up against your bare skin (baby's skin should be bare also). This contact is reassuring to a newborn, who is used to being inside of mom's belly and hearing and feeling the constant presence of another human being.

, New babies should sleep about 16 hours a day, but they usually sleep in spurts. Don't get frustrated with your infant because they won't sleep, there is probably a reason why. Most babies need to be fed about every 2-4 hours because they have small stomachs. Uncomfortable wetness or dirty diapers can also wake a baby. Sometimes, babies just want to be held or comforted. Develop a strategy with your partner for taking care of an infant when you are both tired. Ensuring that everybody is well rested will make life with an infant much easier.

When you are providing information for your baby’s birth certificate, you will be asked if you want to apply for an SS number for your baby. Mark ‘yes’ in the appropriate space on the birth certificate application., If you say ‘yes’ to applying for an SS number for your baby along with her birth certificate application, you should provide both parents’ SS numbers if known. However, it is still possible to apply for an SS number for your baby without this information., Applying for an SS number for your baby at the hospital is voluntary, but if you do apply for an SS number along with your baby’s birth certificate application, then the state agency that issues birth certificates will share the baby’s information with the Social Security Administration (SSA). The SSA will then mail you your baby’s SS card.Applying for an SS card for your baby at the hospital is a much more efficient way of getting an SS number for your baby. If you choose instead to apply at an SSA office later, this could add up to 12 weeks of processing time because the SSA would need to verify your baby’s birth certificate from the office that issued it. This verification process is designed to prevent people from using fraudulent birth records to obtain SS numbers.Know that in some localities, the Post Office will not deliver your baby’s SS card unless her name is on your mailbox."

Check the water temperature.,
Find the right soaps and lotions.,
Never leave a baby unattended in a bathtub.",How to Bathe a Newborn," The stump of a newborn's umbilical cord stays attached for up to three weeks. The American Academy of Pediatricians recommends waiting until the stump falls off before submerging a newborn in water. During this time you should stick to sponge baths.You do not need to bathe your newborn every day during her first weeks. In fact, too much washing may be harmful to her skin. The face, neck, and diaper area are the areas that truly need washing and can be attended with burp cloths and clean diapers. Do not wash your newborn more than a few times a week.Talk to your pediatrician if the stump does not fall off after three weeks. This may be a sign of a larger problem or it may just need to be removed.;
, You will need to a variety of supplies ready in order to give your newborn a sponge bath. Make sure you have supplies laid out before you begin the bathing process.


Find a warm place where there is a flat surface. Aim for a kitchen or bathroom counter. If the room is warm enough, even a blanket laid out on the floor will do.You need a soft towel or changing pad for the baby to lie on during the process.You'll need a sink or shallow plastic basin to hold the water for the bath.You will also need a washcloth, cotton balls, baby soap, baby wipes, and a clean diaper., Once your supplies are all in one place, you can begin bathing your newborn.


Always have one hand on your baby. Newborns do not have much control of their movements and you need to keep one hand on your baby to make sure he does not hurt himself by squirming.First, undress your baby and wrap him in a towel. Lay him down on his back on a blanket or towel.Start with the face. Wet a towel and wring it out. Do not use soap for this part, as you don't want soap getting in your baby's eyes. Gently wipe down the baby's face. Use a damp cotton ball or clean cloth to wipe your baby's eyelids so they're free of crust and residue. Move from the inside to the outside.Plain water might be okay when bathing the rest of your baby's body. However, if your baby is dirty or producing a smell, use a baby-safe moisturizing soap. Make sure to wash creases under arms and ears thoroughly, as well as between the fingers and toes.Only expose the areas of your baby that you are washing. You want to make sure your newborn stays warm., Once your newborn's umbilical cord stump has fallen off, you can bathe her in a tub or sink. Make sure you choose a sink or tub that's safe for the baby.


Free-standing plastic tubs, made specifically for bathing newborns, can be purchased at most baby stores or online. They also sell inflatable tubs that fit inside a bathtub or sink.As long as you line a bathtub or sink with a rubber mat to prevent slipping, this can also be a viable option.Fill the tub with only 2 to 3 inches of warm water. Keep one hand on your newborn at all times., You want to make sure your baby is secure and safe in the tub. Figure out to hold him so he's comfortable and does not move around too much.


Keep a secure hold on your baby, but one that doesn't make him feel uncomfortable.Support your baby's head and torso with your arm, using the other hand to wash him. You can do this by wrapping your arm around your baby's back. When the time comes to wash his back and buttocks, shift your baby so he's leaning forward on your arm.You can also buy a bath seat at a baby store or online. However, even when using a bath seat, you still need to keep a hand on your baby at all times., A newborn's bath should take no longer than 10 or 15 minutes.


Before putting your baby in the tub, undress her down to her diaper. Wash her face and eyes the same way you would during a sponge bath, with a damp, soap-free cloth and damp cotton balls for the eyelids.Once you are done, remove your baby's diaper. If there's feces in the diaper, clean her bottom and genitals before putting her in the bath. When you lower her into the tub, do so feet first.You can use your hand, a sponge, or a damp wash cloth to gently clean your baby. You can use baby-safe soap. If your baby's skin is dry, try a moisturizing cleanser.You can gently pour water over your baby during the bath to keep her warm.
Washing your baby's hair might not be necessary. However, if the hair seems dirty, or your baby has a common condition called cradle cap that produces scaly patches on her scalp, it's a good idea to give her hair a quick wash. Gently massage shampoo into the baby's scalp. Rinse the hair with a washcloth or run it under the faucet. Always cup your hand over your baby's forehead to prevent soap from getting in her eyes.When you're done washing your baby, remove her from the tub and quickly wrap her in a towel. Gently pat her dry and dress her in clean clothes., Water temperature is important to a newborn's well being. Make sure you know the proper water temperature to keep your baby safe and comfortable.


It's best to put cold water in the tub first and then add hot water. Mix the water well and eliminate any hot or cold spots.It might be a good idea to invest in a thermometer to make sure the temperature is a safe level for a newborn. The ideal temperature should be around 98°F (36.6°C). This is around normal body temperature. If you don't have a thermometer, use your elbow instead of your hand to test warmth.If your baby has access to water taps during the bath, discourage him from touching them. As he ages, he'll be strong enough to turn the water on and could potentially scald himself., While soap is not always necessary when bathing a newborn, if you choose to use soap make sure it's baby safe.


Never use scented soaps or bubble baths. These can be drying and irritating to a baby's skin.Plain water is usually fine. If you feel soap is needed, choose a mild, moisturizing soap specially made for babies as not to dry out a baby's skin.Usually, a newborn should not need lotion after a bath. Drying the folds of a baby's skin after each bath prevents rashes well enough. If you end up needing lotion, choose one that's hypoallergenic in case your newborn has allergies you do not know about yet., Even if you're just leaving the room for a few seconds, it's extremely dangerous to leave a newborn unattended in a bath.


Always have everything for your baby's bath ready before putting your baby in the water so you aren't tempted to leave the room to grab something.If you absolutely need to leave the room, take your baby out of the tub first. Newborns can drown in only 3 centimetres (1.2 in) of water. Leaving a baby alone, even for a moment, can be disastrous.If you are bathing the baby on an elevated surface such as a counter, he can easily fall and get hurt.

Discuss appropriate versus inappropriate touching.,
Tell them what to do if someone acts creepy (touching, creepy words, etc.).,
Explain that adults can be bullies too.,
Teach them to recognize signs of danger, and get help if someone makes them uncomfortable.",How to Protect Your Children from Child Abuse2," Explain that it's not okay for others to touch their ""bathing suit areas"" (except in health cases, like diaper changing or doctor visits). Explain that if someone is touching them in a way that creeps them out, this is not okay.


When children get older, talk about how they might want to touch in sexual ways. Emphasize that this is normal, and it's okay if they have clear communication: their partner says ""yes"" and gives continuous consent, and both parties express any reservations or discomfort.

, If another person (child or adult) talks about their ""bathing suit areas,"" pressures them, or tries to make them touch private places on themselves or others, your child should know how to say ""no."" Advise them to get away from the creep and tell an adult they


Ask your child to identify several adults they trust. That way, if you aren't around when they face a creep, they can go to someone else. Mention a few other adults they could go to if their list isn't very long.

, Just as it is wrong when kids hit or call names to other kids, it is wrong for adults to do this to kids or other adults. Make it clear that this is the fault of the perpetrator, not the victim, and that no one should have to put up with an adult bully.


Encourage the child to talk to someone if they are being bullied by an adult.

, These include:


People who lavish attention on them, to a strange or uncomfortable amount, and want to get very intimate
People who talk a lot about bathing-suit areas with them, or expose themselves
Adults who offer candy, ask them to get in a car or isolated place with them (sometimes saying ""will you help me find my lost puppy?""), etc.

Take time to really listen to your child.,
Offer decisions to your child.,
Explain your decisions to your child.",How to Protect Your Children from Child Abuse3," It's important to communicate and understand how they feel and what they want. Put away distractions and ask open-ended questions, such as ""What happened at school today?"" and ""Why are you feeling frustrated?"" Give them your full attention and take time to really understand what they're saying.


Open-ended questions usually start with what, where, when, why, or how.
Hold off with the judgment and advice. Instead of jumping in with advice, let your child feel understood and validated. Then ask ""Would you like advice?"" (They will probably say yes.)
If your child feels safe coming to you with smaller problems, they will probably feel safe coming to you with bigger ones.

, This can help them feel that their opinion is valued, and that they can speak up. Find little choices that your child can make to give them some control over what happens in their lives.


Have them pick out their own outfits, or choose between a few.
When you are in the fruits and vegetables section of the grocery store, ask them what they would like to eat.
Let them make choices about meals. ""Would you like me to make broccoli or carrots with the chicken tonight?""

, Sometimes, you have to override a ""no:"" no, they can't eat dessert first, no, they may not stay up late, no, they may not skip taking a bath. When this happens, explain why the given thing is important. Validate their feelings and acknowledge that they are upset, without caving on your decision.


For example, ""You need to sit in a carseat in order to stay safe. I know that you don't enjoy it. If we get into an accident, your carseat will protect you more than a seatbelt could. If your carseat is uncomfortable, you can tell me about it and we can find a way to fix it together.""
This does not mean surrendering power to your child: your word is law in these cases, and you are explaining why the laws matter.

Gently inquire if you notice something is wrong.,
Keep your cool.,
Show your child that you care and take them seriously.,
Reinforce that they did nothing wrong.,
Plan how to proceed.,
Offer continuous love and reassurance.",How to Protect Your Children from Child Abuse4," If something is different with your child (behavior changes, developmental regression, injuries your child didn't mention), take them aside and gently ask what happened.


""I see a big bruise on your arm. What happened?""
""You seem very sad and withdrawn lately. Would you like to talk to me about what's going on?""
""You used not to wet your bed anymore, and now it happened twice in the last week. Would you please talk to me about what's going on?""
There's a chance it isn't caused by abuse: a bruise from soccer, sadness over a friendship problem, eating less due to an illness, et cetera. Giving them time to talk will help you figure out what is bothering your child, and how to help them.
If a child responds secretively, there is a greater chance that something big is going on.

, It's normal to feel a wave of difficult emotions, from anger to disbelief to fear. Take a deep breath keep your temper under control.


If you're having trouble staying calm, say so, placing the blame on the abuser and not the child. ""I'm very upset to hear that she did this to you. It's hard to stay calm for me right now. I want to hear what you have to say, so I'm going to take a few deep breaths and then I'll be ready to keep listening.""

, Go to a private place to talk about this, and listen carefully to them without immediately offering judgment or advice. Gently ask them to explain as needed, and respect it if they don't feel comfortable retelling all the upsetting details right away.


Don't doubt their words or state that they misinterpreted it.
Avoid prying. Your child may feel very distressed, and pressuring them to answer questions they aren't ready for may only make things worse. Take it slowly, and trust that they'll tell details if and when they're ready.

, Say that you're glad they told you, and they did the right thing by being honest. Remind them how brave they are to handle this, and that none of it is their fault.


Put your child's well-being and freedom from danger first. Take him/her to see a physician if he/she has a bad-enough, even severe, body damage. You should also notify your office for protective services about this. Let them know about what happened, the abuser, what type of abuse it was, etc.

, Explain to your child that because this is important, it needs to be reported to authorities who can handle the abuser and keep the child (and all other children) safe from the abuser.


Try calling a child abuse hotline to figure out the steps you need to take to care for your child and report the abuser.

, Remind your child how much you love them, be patient with them, and let them come to you when they are upset.

Buy a new crib.,
Decide on either a single function or convertible crib.,
Consider a crib with an adjustable bed height.,
Choose a simple design.,
Check for safety hazards.,
Buy the mattress when you buy the crib.,
Do not purchase bumper pads, pillows, comforters, or toys for the crib.",How to Buy Nursery Furniture2," It’s important that you do not buy or accept a used crib. Older cribs may not be up to current safety standards. They also could be damaged or in disrepair. Make sure you purchase a new crib from a reputable merchant and that the date of manufacture is displayed on the shipping package., A single function crib serves one purpose as a crib for your baby, while a convertible crib can transition into a toddler bed once the child grows. A single function crib will be cheaper initially, but a convertible crib can grow with your child and make the purchase a longer term investment.

, Many cribs are adjustable in height. This feature provides flexibility for both you and your child. Cribs with adjustable bed heights allow you to lower the height of the bed as your child grows and learns to stand up in the crib.

, Avoid finials, scrollwork, and drop-side cribs. Infants can become entangled in detail work, making such cribs unsafe. Drop-side cribs, which allow a parent to put down one side of the crib to get a child in or out, are no longer considered safe., Make sure the spaces between the crib’s slats are no more than 2 3/8 inches or 6 centimeters wide. Check for protrusions or abnormalities that could harm your baby such as corner posts, sharp edges, or screws and nuts that protrude., Don’t wait to buy a mattress. It’s critical that you purchase both the mattress and the crib at the same time. Legally the mattress has to be at least 27 ¼ inches or 69 ¼ centimeters wide and 51 5/8 inches or 131 centimeters long. It can’t be more than 6 inches or 15 ¼ centimeters thick., These all pose significant suffocation hazards for your child and should be completely avoided. Remember that nothing should go in the crib except for the baby.

Try a rocker or glider out before purchasing.,
Opt for a solid wood frame.,
Choose cushions that are dense and darkly covered.,
Order at least ten weeks before the baby arrives.",How to Buy Nursery Furniture3," The calming back-and-forth motion that a rocking chair or glider affords is a nice addition to any nursery. Make sure you take the time to visit a store and find one that’s a good fit for you and your baby., When seeking out a rocking chair or glider, go for one that is constructed of solid wood. If your budget allows, go for a hardwood option like cherry or walnut. These woods are durable and will stand up to regular rocking and gliding., A dense cushion means it’s less likely to lump up after regular use. Aim for cushions covered in dark, woven fabrics that won’t fray. Make sure the back cushions, seat cushions, and arms are supportive and high-padded.Opt for easy to clean cushions and wood finishes.

, Many rocking chairs and gliders are custom made. This means they often are not available for immediate shipment. Make sure you place your order at least ten weeks, preferably more, before your infant is due to arrive."

Choose a changing table with barriers on all four sides and a latching belt.,
Try it before you buy it.,
Use the changing pad that comes with the table.",How to Buy Nursery Furniture4," If you have room in the nursery, you should purchase a changing table that offers a barrier on all sides. Your changing table should also include a latching belt to hold the baby in place., If at all possible, you should test out a changing table in the store before deciding on a model to purchase. Consider your height alongside that of the table. You should also check that any cabinets or drawers are easy to access and completely functional., If the changing table you purchase comes with a changing pad, this is the pad you should use. It will likely be customized to work with that specific changing table as opposed to a pad you might buy separately."

Fill out the application.,
Gather supporting documents.,
Take the supporting information to your nearest SSA office.",How to Apply for a Social Security Number for a Baby2," If you choose to apply for an SS number for your baby at an SSA office, you will need to fill out an Application for a Social Security Card (Form SS-5), available here. This form is a fillable PDF and can be filled online before printing or printed out and filled in ink. The forms are also available at SSA offices and can be filled out on the day of application. The information required on the form includes:Your baby’s name;
Your baby’s place and date of birth;
Your baby’s citizenship status;
Voluntary information about your baby’s ethnicity and race;
Your baby’s sex;
Yours and your spouse’s names and SS numbers. If SS number(s) are not known, mark “unknown”.
Your mailing address;
Your relationship to the baby (e.g. natural, adoptive parent or legal guardian);
Your signature and the date the application is submitted.

, Along with your application, you will need to present supporting documents that prove your baby’s identity, age, and U.S. citizenship, as well as documents proving your own identity.For proof of U.S. citizenship, the acceptable documents include a U.S. birth certificate, U.S. passport, Certificate of Naturalization, or Certificate of Citizenship.Note that all babies born in the United States (with a few minor exceptions) have a birthright to U.S. citizenship.To prove your baby’s age, you need to provide her birth certificate if she was born in the United States. If a birth certificate is known to exist, you must provide it with your application. However, if a birth certificate does not exist, the SSA may be able to accept a religious record showing the baby’s date of birth, a U.S. hospital record of birth, or a passport.If the child was born outside the United States (but is still a U.S. citizen through parentage), then you need to provide a foreign birth certificate (if you have one or can get a copy within 10 business days). If that is not possible, the SSA may be able to accept a Certificate of Birth Abroad, a Certificate of Report of Birth, a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, a Certificate of Naturalization, or a passport.The SSA will only accept certain documents to prove your child’s identity. The document must be current (not expired) and show your baby’s name, other identifying information and, preferably, a photograph. A non-photo ID may be acceptable in general if the document has enough information to identify the baby without the photo (e.g. the child’s name and age, date of birth, or parents’ names).To prove your child’s identity, the SSA generally prefers to see your child’s U.S. passport, but if that is not available, you can provide a state-issued ID card, an adoption decree, a doctor or clinic or hospital record, a religious record, or a school or daycare center record.To prove your own identity, you will need to provide a U.S. driver’s license, a state ID card, or a U.S. passport. If you do not have any of these, then you will be asked to provide an Employee ID card, a School ID card, a Health insurance card, a U.S. military ID card, or a life insurance policy. Note that these must be originals or copies certified by the issuing agency; notarized copies or photocopies are not acceptable.Note that you must provide at least TWO documents in total to fulfill requirements of proving age, identity, and citizenship. One document can be used more than once (e.g. your baby’s U.S. passport can be used both to prove citizenship and identity, or a birth certificate can be used to prove both age and citizenship) but you need a minimum of two documents for your baby.

, Take the supporting information and the application form if you filled or printed one out already. You can use the SSA office locator, available here, to get a list of SSA offices near you.


Forms are also available at the SSA office and can be filled out at the time of application.
Once your forms are checked and your supporting documents verified, your application will be submitted and you will receive your baby’s SS card with her SS number printed on the front in the mail usually a few weeks after submitting the application.Remember that your baby’s name may be required to appear on your mailbox in some localities for the Post Office to deliver mail in your baby’s name."

Fill out the application.,
Take your DHS documents to the SSA office.,
Prove your child's age.,
Prove your child's identity.,
Revisit the SSA office to update your baby's citizenship record.",How to Apply for a Social Security Number for a Baby3," If you are adopting a foreign-born baby, your baby automatically acquires U.S. citizenship after recent changes to the law.In the case of foreign-born adopted children, the application form is the same as for other children but the supporting documentation and procedures might differ slightly. Begin by filling out the application form (Form SS-5), available here. This form is a fillable PDF and can be filled online before printing or printed out and filled in ink. The forms are also available at SSA offices and can be filled out on the day of application.

, The difference between other applications and applications for foreign-born adopted children is that although foreign-born adopted children now acquire U.S. citizenship automatically, they do not have proof of U.S. citizenship traditionally used for SS card applications. In this case, you can take the immigration documents issued to you by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for your adopted baby. Submit the application with the DHS documents and the SSA will issue your baby an SS number. Note that at this stage, your baby's record with the SSA will not show that she is a U.S. citizen, and you will require a proof of citizenship document to update her record later., Just as in the case of other children, you will need to prove your baby's age to the SSA office. You can use your child's foreign birth certificate to prove her age., Just as in the case of other children, you will need to prove your baby's identity to the SSA office. Acceptable identity documents, all of which must be originals or certified by the issuing agency, include:The adoption record;
A United States DHS immigration document;
Doctor, clinic or hospital records;
Daycare center or school records;
A religious record (e.g. a Baptismal record).

, The Child Citizenship Act 2000 grants a foreign-born adopted child automatic citizenship without a citizenship document. However, you can apply for a proof of citizenship document for your foreign-born adopted baby (e.g. a Certificate of Citizenship from DHS or a U.S. passport from the Department of State). Either one of these documents can be used to prove your baby's U.S. citizenship. Take one of these documents with you again to the SSA office to update their records so that the SSA records now show that your child is a U.S. citizen.

Recognize the signs of teething discomfort.",How to Put a Baby to Sleep," A nightly routine will help your baby adapt to going to sleep at the same time every evening, which should help to make it easier to get her to sleep. Create a routine that works for you. It can include things like bath time, comfortable bedtime clothes, a story, a final feeding, a massage, or anything else that helps your baby wind down before bed.


You don’t have to follow every aspect of your routine every single night (nor in the order listed), but make sure that you always do things in the same order according to your routine, so that your baby knows what to expect and recognizes relaxation cues.Even if she’s too young to understand, tell your baby when it’s bedtime so that she will begin to understand the verbal cues.;
, Don’t give her so much that she’s overly full and uncomfortable, but give her enough so that she’s satisfied and not hungry before bed.

, Before bed, try a short massage. For 10 to 15 minutes, use slow, long strokes and moderate pressure to massage her arms, legs, hands, feet, back, and tummy.Try a baby-friendly oil, such as sunflower or grapeseed.


Gently rub her face, including her forehead, the bridge of her nose, and her head., A warm bath is relaxing for adults and babies, and it’s a nice addition to your nighttime routine. Consider skipping this step if your baby finds baths too exciting or dislikes being in the water.


Avoid having toys or other stimulants in the nighttime bath, as the purpose of this bath is quiet, soothing time before sleep., Use a good, thick, nighttime diaper to prevent leaks and unnecessary mid-night changes. Choose soft pajamas made from a breathable fabric, because babies sleep better when they are cool versus warm. Use booties, skull caps, and sleeping sacks over blankets, as blankets pose a suffocation risk., Be sure to use a low, quiet, monotone voice that won’t startle or stimulate her. Every baby is different and responds to stimuli differently, and if your baby doesn’t relax during story time, try other soothing methods, such as:


Walking around with her in your arms or in a carrier
Rocking her gently in a chair or in your arms
Singing her a song
Playing her quiet music

, Look for signs of tiredness, such as yawning, heavy eyes, whininess, making fists, and eye rubbing. Putting her to bed and letting her fall asleep on her own will help her learn to soothe herself to sleep.


Avoid eye contact at this stage, as it might stimulate her and wake her up again.

, Babies should always sleep on their backs, as babies who sleep on their tummies are at an increased risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome).Soothe your baby with physical contact as you transfer her to bed. Gently lay your hand on her stomach, arms, or head to reassure her that you are there and make her feel safe and secure., This includes bedroom lights, lamps, nightlights, monitors and screens, and anything else that might create artificial light. Unnatural light can interfere with our circadian rhythms, which is our natural sleep-wake cycle.


Consider dimming the lights during your pre-bed routine to reduce your baby’s exposure to light before it’s time to sleep.Keep the room dark all night. Nighttime exposure to artificial light can suppress the body’s production of melatonin, which is the hormone responsible for regulating the sleep-wake cycle., A mid-night feeding while she’s still asleep can stave off hunger longer, and may prevent your baby from waking up for an extra couple hours. Since she’ll be drinking slower and won’t swallow as much air, try forgoing burping after bedtime or mid-night feedings, because this may wake her up and make it difficult to get her back to sleep., Remove all blankets, toys, pillows, and other items. Not only are these distractions for a sleepy baby, but they also pose a danger in terms of suffocation risk and SIDS., Try swaddling your baby if she doesn’t easily sleep through the night and wakes often. The careful wrapping of the blanket will prevent her limbs from jerking and possibly waking her up,keep her warm, make her feel safe, replicate conditions in the womb, and may help her sleep better.Moreover, the tight and careful wrapping of the blanket will prevent it from coming loose and creating a suffocation risk.


Don’t swaddle children over two months old during unsupervised sleep time, as babies this age begin attempting to roll over., In the mother’s womb, a baby hears the noises of everyday life 24 hours a day. Making noise or creating white noise in your baby’s room will help replicate what she heard in the womb,and prevent her from becoming a light or sensitive sleeper.

, For babies older than six months, essential oils like lavender and chamomile can be used in small quantities in their rooms to create a relaxing scent that promotes sleep. Try these scents in a diffuser, or place a couple drops on a tissue or facecloth near the crib or bassinet, This is especially important if your baby tends to wake up congested or with a stuffy nose. As much as possible, keep your baby’s room and the entire house clean, dry, and dust free. Common irritants that could disrupt sleep and should be kept out of the bedroom include:Smoke and paint fumes
Pet dander, lint, and dust that collect on stuffed animals, canopies, and drapes
Feathers from pillows or comforters
Baby powder
Perfumes and hairsprays
Plants

, Late night interaction with your baby can help soothe her back to sleep, but it may also encourage more wake-ups in the middle of the night. Don’t make eye contact, and keep talking and singing to a minimum. Try gentle touching on her belly, head, and face, and speak in soft a voice.The most likely reason your baby has awoken in the middle of the night is because she’s hungry, because babies generally get hungry every one to three hours, and newborns especially shouldn’t go more than four hours without eating., Especially with older babies whose bodies have begun to develop a circadian rhythm that’s guided by light and dark, don’t turn on the lights or take your baby into a lit room when you are trying to soothe her back to sleep in the middle of the night.

, While a wet and stinky diaper certainly needs to be dealt with, an unnecessary diaper change can wake your baby up more than she was and make it more difficult to get her back to sleep. Your baby doesn’t need her diaper changed after every feeding, so at night, only change a dirty diaper., Not only can this help soothe your baby back to sleep, it may also help prevent SIDS. Be sure to use a cord- and clip-free pacifier to prevent choking and strangulation hazards., Particularly fussy babies may be suffering from teething pains, which can start as early as three months. Talk to your doctor about baby-safe painkillers if you suspect teething is preventing your baby from getting a good night’s sleep. Teething signs include:Excessive drooling or a wet bed sheet under her head
Tender and swollen gums
Mild fever

Choose a soothing color for the walls.,
Choose soft fabrics.,
Keep your nursery clutter-free.",How to Make Your Baby's Nursery Soothing Enough for Sleep1," The most obvious way to create a soothing environment for your baby is to choose a wall color that is calming. For example, green is often seen as an ideal color choice for walls as it is a natural and calming color. Orange is a comforting color that evokes feelings of coziness. Choosing a warm blue color may be soothing for your baby. Lavender colors will also be soothing for your baby.Try to aim for wall colors that are a bit softer. For example, you might find that an entire room painted bright green is not as soothing as you had imagined it would be. Softer, more neutral shades will be less overpowering. On the other hand, if you want to use a bold orange color, you can paint just one wall in that color and choose a softer complementary color for the other walls.
Try to think in the long term. Unless you are OK with repainting the walls again, try to choose colors that will be enjoyable for years to come. There are always trends that come and go, but choosing a more classic color means your baby’s nursery can easily be transitioned into a big boy or girl bedroom later on.
Colors like red, yellow, and black tend to evoke stronger emotions in people. These are not necessarily bad choices for a nursery, but since your aim is to create a soothing environment it may be best to stay away from these colors or at least limit them to accents.;
, Another great way to make a soothing nursery is to choose fabrics that are soft and cozy. For example, choose bedding that will feel soft against your baby’s delicate skin. If you don’t have carpet in the nursery, you can place soft rugs that will give the room a cozier feel, and that will also help keep the room a bit warmer during the colder months. You can keep a soft blanket to use when you are cuddling with your baby, but do not place this in the crib with your baby while they are sleeping.Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of death of babies under one year of age.Bedding is believed to be one cause of SIDS. Thus, it is recommended that babies sleep on a firm mattress. You can have a fitted sheet that is tightly wrapped around the mattress, but all other items (e.g. blankets, stuffed animals, pillows, toys, etc.) should be removed from the crib.
Instead of a blanket, your baby can wear some cozy pajamas or even a wearable blanket to keep warm.

, It may be tempting to decorate the walls with lots of pictures and to fill the room with decorations and furniture, but your baby may feel more relaxed in a simple, clean space. Try to limit furniture to what you feel is essential, and if you want to decorate the walls, try not to fill the walls with pictures. Keep it simple.Additionally, at the end of each day, try to do a quick sweep of the room to clean up any messes that have been made.

Work together as a team.,
Sit down and write out your schedule on paper.,
Ask for hours or shifts that work for both of you.,
Ask for help.,
Accept that both of you need to make room for uninterrupted sleep.,
Maintain a positive outlook.,
Keep in touch.,
Spend as much time with the baby yourself after work.,
Thank each other.",How to Accommodate a New Baby in a Shift Work Schedule," Since both of you must continue working, for whatever reason, and both of you are responsible for this new life, then both of you must work as a team. This means keeping open the communication channels about everything.;
, Allocate work time, sleep time and baby time. There is no time for anything else for the first few months. Your priorities are these three things alone. Where you find clashes or gaps in the schedule, you will need to discuss who is best able to make changes; or which relatives or friends or neighbors may be able to fill in for you during these times. For example, difficult times might include commuting time or crucial sleep time when only one partner is available.

, If one of you has a day job and the other has a night job, this will be a little easier than if both of you work shifts. In the first case, you will have more opportunities to share the caring responsibilities. If both of you work shifts, however, you will both need to ask your employers to accommodate different time arrangements. Whoever has the most flexibility in timing arrangements will be the one who has to make arrangements around the other partner's work timetable. Always let your employer know that your needs are temporary, until the baby is older and you can find other, suitable arrangements.

, Be open and forthright about your needs with others. Tell people that you feel you can trust to help out why both of you need to keep working and how, for a short time, you would really appreciate minor help here and there. The more people you seek help from, the more likely you will gather a little pool of helpers who can pitch in for you when needed.

, You will be more tired than you have ever felt before juggling work and a baby. All the same, you must ensure that you both get a minimum amount of uninterrupted sleep to reduce the likelihood of making mistakes at work. The partner who is working shift work is already undertaking a difficult task, as the body is being asked to cope with staying awake at unusual hours. Accidents happen very easily to over-tired people. However, with a new baby, both of you are effectively working shift work, whether you like it or not! So it is very important to plan uninterrupted sleep as a key part of your schedule.

, A new baby becomes less demanding over time and the options for daycare will open up to free up your schedules. Until then, however, you must support one another and reassure each other that caring for your baby is the most important priority. Openly acknowledge that sacrifices must be made for a short period of time. It may be hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel but there are millions of parents who can assure you that you will make it.

, If there are problems, both of you should have speed dial lines of communication to one another. Again, alert your employer that there may be minor emergencies during which you will need to either leave work temporarily or earlier than usual, or even during which you may need to absent yourself from work. Always reassure your employer that you will make up for lost time and ask the employer for any suggestions they have (meaning, don't assume that your employer will be happy about having to make such allowances).

, Play, snuggle up, talk and sing together.

, Both of you have a special gift in each other and in the baby. Don't forget to let each other know how much love you still have for each other and how loved your child is.

Clear the room of any toys and furniture that may pre-exist in the room.,
Pick a theme to the baby nursery, in terms of color, and paint the proposed nursery.,
Prepare the room in wall-to-wall carpeting.,
Ask a carpenter (most father to-be figures would be willing) to assemble any and all of the pieces of furniture that need to be put together.,
Vacuum the floor.,
Prepare the crib for the baby's arrival, including preparing the crib-sheet for initial ""touchdown"" among many other things, along with a receiving blanket and blanket (depending on season).

,
Prepare the changing table's stacking area with the necessary diapers, and ointments, and an extra pacifier in an un-seen area that couldn't be visible to the child.,
Hang a baby monitor in a highly untouchable and out-of-the-way location inside the room, where it can easily be recording the baby's sounds clearly.,
Stock all necessary items on hand, including any second-sets of necessary items.,
Prepare any furniture with some first sets of ""at-home"" clothing.,
Prepare an area where any disposable products can be disposed of in a plausible manner.",How to Prepare a Baby Nursery for a Newborn Baby's Arrival,";
, If the room contains a closet or any tucked-away space, clear those areas away completely too. Clothing should come out of all closet spaces the proposed nursery will hold, and all alley-ways should be free of other un-necessary items.

,


Although few baby nurseries ever contain wallpaper on the wall at first, some parents enjoy placing a wallpaper border on a wall out of hands reach.

Pick colors that are vibrant and can lighten the room when and where necessary.

, Although nothing comes close to complete vigilance over your child, if your child can hurt themselves on the floor, carpeting (and it's underlayment) gives the floor a little more padding, and a little less possibility of your baby becoming critically hurt. (They can in fact, be seriously hurt, in most cases though, so be prepared!)

, Most important pieces are the crib and changing table, but may include a glider-rocker and glider-rocker ottoman.


Try to assemble the furniture inside the room that the item will later be placed in, to lessen the chance of having to find out that the item won't fit through the door, then having to remove the assembly piece-by-piece, and have to reassemble the item once it's been taken completely into the room.

, This will pick up any dust or dirt that may have accumulated while assembling the pieces.


For an even cleaner room, use a vacuum that a HEPA filter that has been changed recently.

,,


Use a diaper-stacker if one is available, for at least the first few months of your child's life. They come in handy when you are in a pinch. You can even hang the pacifier that was originally stated to be on the changing table, from inside this, directly from a cloth diaper-diaper pin attached to the face-guard holder mechanism of the pacifier.

, Assuming the child won't (in time) figure out where you keep these things, and assuming the crib isn't moved around that much, position the monitor directly underneath the crib.


Be sure to hang the ""base"" unit that will emit the sounds made inside the master bedroom as well as one other location in the house (that is widely used). What would one ""recording station"" be without it's mate at the receiving area/receiving station?

, Between diaper ointments, disposable diapers, pacifiers, and anything else that can be needed at changing-time, this area should be the most useful area in the room for the parents to-be.

, Whether these be shirts and pants for the child, or, especially at first a onesie or blanket-sleeper, the drawers will need to be filled.

, Whether it's a Diaper-Genie product or a trash can for disposable diapers, or a dirty clothes hamper for cloth diapers that need to be washed, the dirty stuff needs to be deposited someplace safe and tucked-away where little hands can't get ahold of them.

Avoid co-sleeping.",How to Put a Baby to Sleep Without Nursing," Depending on how old your baby is, she needs a different amount of sleep.If she is 5 or under, the recommended daily sleep amounts time by age are:


Infants 0 – 2 months need 10.5 – 18 hours every day.
Babies 2 – 12 months need 14 – 15 hours every day.;
, Set a consistent bedtime that incorporates a routine. This can help her fall asleep without nursing in addition to relaxing her and regulate her sleep cycle.Consider naps, feedings, and your baby’s age when fixing her bedtime.Don't worry about setting bedtimes during the first two months.
Set a reasonable bedtime for you and your baby. You may want some “me time” after putting your baby down for the night.You may need to tweak the schedule occasionally to accommodate activities or other factors like illness., Most babies require some time to shift into bedtime mode. Promoting relaxation through rituals and environment can help your baby relax and get to sleep, especially without nursing or feeding.Begin winding down at least two hours before your baby’s bedtime.
Dampen any loud noises.Dim the lights around the house and especially in your baby’s room. This lets her know that it’s time to sleep.Speak to your baby and rub her back to relax and reassure her if she is fussy., Follow a nightly bedtime ritual that does not include nursing.Taking a bath, reading a story, singing, or listening to soothing music can cue and your baby to sleep without the aid of nursing.Read or sing to your baby to help relax him.Give him a warm bath and massage to enhance relaxation., Create a room for your baby that promotes relaxation and sleep. Setting an optimal temperature, dampening noise, and shutting out light can help fall and stay asleep.Set the room temperature between 65 and 75°F (18.3 to 23.8°C).Remove anything from your baby’s room that may stimulate her, such as electronics.Control light with soft bulbs and curtains or blinds. Using a night light in a non-stimulating color like red can help you find her or even reassure her.Use a white noise machine to dampen noises that may otherwise wake your baby.Remove blankets and soft items from the crib or bassinet to prevent suffocation., Place your baby in his crib or bassinet when he is drowsy but awake. This can help him associate the bed with sleep and reduce his need to nurse in order to sleep.This can also reduce the amount of nighttime care you provide.Place your baby on his back to sleep.If he stirs when you put him in the crib, allow him to adjust and then see if he falls back asleep. If not, pick him up again until he is drowsy.

, If your baby isn’t sleeping or requires nighttime feedings after six months, schedule an appointment with your pediatrician. She may be able to assess why your baby is still hungry at night or if your baby is just wanting feeds for the attention and affection.Prepare notes on your baby’s sleep and feeding patterns to take to the appointment with you. This can help your doctor more effectively diagnose what may be going on with your baby’s sleep cycle and give you tips to improve it.

, Babies have different requirements for sleeping and eating depending on how old they are. Learning about the sleep cycles of babies can help you more effectively get your baby to sleep without nursing.Babies generally do not require nighttime feedings once they weigh 11 pounds.Newborns need to eat more often and generally sleep for up to three hours in between feedings.This means you may need to wake your baby to feed him until he is old or weighs enough to sleep without eating.
Between two to three months and depending on weight, your baby may need an additional feeding at night. Most two to three months old babies need one to two feedings at night. They usually need to feed by five to six hours. After four months, most healthy babies do not metabolically require feedings during the night and can usually sleep for seven to eight hours without a feeding.Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about what is feasible., At around three months, reduce the number of nighttime feedings you give your baby. This can ultimately help reinforce the baby falling asleep without nursing.If your baby cries, either allow her to stir to see if she goes back to sleep or give her a pacifier, which may soothe her right back to sleep without feeding., Giving your baby a few sips of milk before you go to sleep may keep him from waking during the night. Wake him up and let him take a few sips, even if he is too tired to drink.The extra sips may have the added benefit of getting you a little more sleep.Be aware that this tactic can backfire and stimulate your baby to wake more often. If this happens, discontinue filling him up at your bedtime and give her a little extra at his last feeding., Once your baby no longer needs to be fed every two to three hours (usually around three to four months old), stretch out the time in between her feedings. This can help her realize that she doesn’t need to nurse to sleep.Add ½ hour between feedings at night every other night. After a few weeks, your baby may no longer need to nurse to fall or stay asleep., Spend a little less time nursing during your baby’s nighttime feeding(s). By gradually decreasing the amount of time you nurse, you can signal your baby that he can sleep without nursing.Suckle your baby for two minutes less per breast over the course of a week.You may need longer than a week to eliminate your baby’s need to nurse for sleep.In addition, limit extra stimulation during night feedings such as noise, lights, or extra attention.

, Your baby may be less likely to nurse at night if she gets sufficient calories throughout the day.Gradually increase how much you nurse your baby during daytime feedings until she doesn’t require nursing to sleep.Suckle your baby for a few minutes more per breast every day.Avoid putting cereal in her bottle or giving her solids too early, which can be detrimental to a baby’s health.Most experts recommend starting solids at around six months.

, The sucking action of nursing may soothe him to sleep. By giving him a pacifier, he may be able to fall asleep without nursing. Research has also shown that pacifier use while sleeping can reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)., Most babies fuss and move around during the night. Only attend to her if she is unable to soothe herself back to sleep or seems sick.Dim lights, speak in a soft voice, move minimally, and don’t put your baby directly at your breast. This helps your baby understand it’s time to sleep and disassociate nursing and sleeping., Although you may be tempted to have your baby close to you at night, avoid bed-sharing or co-sleeping. Not only can this tempt him to nurse himself to sleep, but it can also make it harder for him to fall and stay asleep.Studies have shown that co-sleeping increases the risk for SIDS, suffocation, or strangulation."

Use a sound machine.,
Keep the toys somewhere else.,
Install curtains or blinds to make the room dark.,
Keep the room at an ideal temperature.",How to Make Your Baby's Nursery Soothing Enough for Sleep2," Many parents opt for a machine that produces noise to help soothe the baby, and also to block out other noises that might be disturbing. There are many types of machines to choose from. Some play white noise, some play soft music, while others play a sound such as a heartbeat. Some machines have various sounds that you can choose from.


There is a debate about how long you should keep the machine playing each night, so it may be best to try out different amounts of time to see what works for your baby. For example, many machines come with an automatic shut off after a pre-set amount of time. If you notice that your baby wakes just after it stops, you may want to try playing it for a longer amount of time.
It is important not to set the machine to a volume that could harm your babies hearing. For example, hospital nurseries in the US that use sound machines limit the machines to 50 decibels. You should also not place the machine close to your baby. In fact, experts recommend placing it as far away as possible so, for example, across the room from your baby’s crib., This won’t matter too much if you have a newborn, but as your baby gets older and more mobile, they will likely be looking around the room. Keeping toys and games that are used for play time in another room will help your baby understand that the nursery is for sleeping.If you don’t have the space to keep the toys somewhere else, try keeping them out of sight with something like a toy trunk.

, If the room is light your baby will have a more difficult time staying asleep. You can install thermal curtains, privacy film, or black out blinds on the window (if there is one), which will block out sunlight effectively. The room doesn’t have to be pitch black, but it should be dark enough so that your baby won’t be disturbed by sunlight.Turn off the night light too. Your baby is unlikely to fear the dark until they are at least 18 months old (if at all), so the night light will only make it more difficult for them to sleep. If you need a bit of light for night feedings try installing a lamp with a dimmer switch so you can very gradually increase the amount of light in the room, and decrease it when you are ready to go back to sleep.

, Your baby is not able to regulate their temperature as well as an adult, so it is important to try to keep the room at the right temperature. Anywhere between 61 degrees Fahrenheit (16 C) and 68 degrees (20 C) is good, with an ideal temperature of 65 degrees (18 C). You should never place heating blankets or hot water bottles in the crib, and the crib should not be placed next to a radiator.Overheating is another suspected cause of SIDS, so be sure your baby doesn't get too warm.
If it is very warm in the room, try placing a fan in the room (but don’t point it directly at your baby) or open a window to allow the air to circulate.
You can check whether or not your baby is too warm by feeling their chest or stomach. If the area feels hot or is sweaty, then your baby is too warm. The hands and feet are not a good place to check as they are typically cooler than the rest of the body.

Start your baby’s sleep routine early.,
Give your baby a bath.,
Give your baby a massage.,
Get your baby dressed for bed.,
Dim the lights.,
Try reading a bedtime story.,
Turn on soothing music.,
Ease your baby into sleeping in the nursery.",How to Make Your Baby's Nursery Soothing Enough for Sleep3," If you wait until your baby is sleepy to start the routine, then your baby will be overtired by the time they are ready for bed. At nap times and bedtime, babies have a ""sleep window"" when they are just starting to get tired, but are not so tired that they've become irritable. Once your baby passes their “sleep window,” their body begins to produce cortisol, which is a stress hormone that will make it more difficult for them to fall asleep and to stay asleep.Every baby is different, but if your baby is over 4 months old, they might be ready to sleep anywhere between 5 and 7:30pm.
Note that newborns don’t have a scheduled bedtime since they are still developing circadian rhythms. Until your baby is a few months old, it won’t be necessary to establish a night time routine.

, This is not necessarily a mandatory step, but many parents use a nightly bath as a way to help their babies understand that they are getting ready for bed.A warm bath is relaxing and also a good bonding experience for you and your baby.

, Giving your baby a massage will help them relax even more and is a great way to bond with your baby. You can use baby lotion or baby oil, and massage your baby’s arms, legs, belly, and neck for 10 to 15 minutes after bath time.Massage their legs by gently wrapping your hand around their thigh and then sliding your hand down from the thigh to the ankle. Repeat this on the other leg.
Use a gentle clockwise motion with your fingertips to massage their belly.
You can massage baby's arms using the same technique used for the legs. Wrap your hand around your baby’s upper arm and then slide your hand down to their wrist. Repeat on the other arm.
To massage your baby’s neck, support your baby’s head and upper body in one hand. With the other hand, place your thumb on one side of your baby’s neck, and then wrap your hand under baby’s neck and place your index finger and middle finger on the other side. Use your fingers to gently massage in a circular motion.

, If you have a brand new baby, you may choose to swaddle your baby as this is very soothing for infants. If your baby is older than two months, you should dress them in pajamas based on the temperature. If it is during the warm summer months (over 75 degrees Fahrenheit or 23 C) then your baby probably only needs one layer of clothing. If it is under 75F (23 C) then your baby may need a few more layers to stay warm.A good rule of thumb is that your baby should be dressed in one layer more than you need to be comfortable in the room., Dimming the lights will signal to your baby that it’s time to sleep. You can do this by turning on a soft lamp in your baby’s nursery. If you have an overhead light with a dimmer switch, simply turn the lights down low enough so that your baby will relax, but high enough so that you can still read a book and move around without hurting yourself.When you leave the room, turn the light all the way off so the room is dark enough for your baby to stay asleep.

, Hearing your soft, relaxed voice will be soothing and relaxing for your baby. Try to speak softly and slowly so that your baby will begin to get drowsy.Alternatively, you can also just talk to your baby. For example, tell them about your day. Especially with very young babies, it doesn’t matter much what you are saying. Hearing your voice will be comforting and relaxing.

, Classical music such as baroque or nature sounds can be very relaxing and help to make your baby’s nursery a soothing sanctuary. There are several sleep apps to help babies sleep such as Baby Snooze, Baby Shusher or Lullaby for Babies.Turn on some soothing music in your baby’s room before you put your baby to bed., If you have been co-sleeping with your baby, or if they have been sleeping in the same room with you, it could be a bit distressing for your baby to sleep alone in the nursery at first (depending on the child). You can help ease your baby into sleeping in the nursery by beginning with just one nap alone in the nursery each day. Gradually increase the number of naps your baby takes alone until they are able to sleep at night in the nursery.It can be hard for a parent to be away from their baby. Try to remind yourself that it is healthy for both of you if you are able to spend a bit of time out of each other’s sight. This will also help your baby learn to fall asleep without you there.

Ask for help.,
Go to parenting classes.,
Take care of yourself.,
Be patient.",How to Bond with Your Newborn when You Have Postpartum Depression2," You don’t have to go through this alone. You can ask for help from partners, family members, and friends to help you as you try to bond with your baby. You will start to feel a deeper bond with your baby if you feel secure in your parenting abilities. This may be difficult if you have PDD, but you should have people around you who can help.Ask your partners or family to help you with housework or other daily chores. You may be exhausted or emotionally drained, and you want to focus on your baby when you can.
Talk to them about helping you move towards bonding with your baby. Have them gently encourage you to try to bond and help you to not avoid it.

"
Talk to your health care provider.,
Undergo therapy.,
Consider medication.,
Join a support group.",How to Bond with Your Newborn when You Have Postpartum Depression3," You may consider talking to your health care team about the problems you’re having bonding with your baby. They may be able to give you information or refer you to places where you can learn techniques for bonding with your baby.There may be classes available in your area for new mothers and fathers that teach how to interact, respond, and take care of your baby.
You may also try going to new parents groups.

, Psychotherapy is a common treatment for postpartum depression. Psychotherapy is when you go see a psychologist, therapist, or counselor to talk about your condition. Therapy gives you a place to discuss your fears, feelings, and concerns. Your therapist can offer suggestions on how to manage the symptoms and interact with your baby.Since postpartum depression carries many misconceptions, you may feel like people will judge you if you go to therapy for PPD. Don’t let this stop you. Getting the help you need to heal yourself so you can care for your baby is nothing to be ashamed of.
For example, you may want to tell your therapist if you feel sad, if you feel like self-harming, if you have suicidal thoughts, or if you have feelings that make you feel like you can’t bond with your baby.
Many women with postpartum see results and recovery within two to three months.

, If talk therapy does not help, you may want to consider medication. Your doctor can prescribe antidepressants to help you with your depression. However, you need to understand the negative side effects of antidepressants, such as how some antidepressants make it unsafe for you to breastfeed your baby.Discuss with your doctor the pros and cons of medication. Talk to your partner as you decide whether antidepressants are the right fit for you.
You can take either selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). SSRIs are usually what is prescribed and include Prozac, Zoloft, and Celexa. TCAs are generally used if you can’t take SSRIs and include doxepin.
TCAs are not safe for breastfeeding.

Wait for a quiet alert time.,
Talk to your baby.,
Take the baby on walks.,
Give your baby tummy time.,
Read to your baby.",How to Maximize Your Baby's Alert Time1," Quiet alert time usually comes right after your baby has just woken up. While the baby may move their arms or legs, they are mostly quiet.They may be looking at your face or responding to sounds. This state usually lasts for about an hour at a time, but you may be able to extend it through contact with your baby., Babies in a quiet alert time are receptive to sounds. You can talk to your baby to help them learn how to communicate. What you say doesn’t matter so much as the fact that you are communicating to them with words and expressions.You can also sing songs or nursery rhymes such as “Down by the Bay” or “She’ll Be Coming Around the Mountain.”If your baby is under three months, you may want to keep your face close to them. Newborns have difficulty seeing beyond 12 inches (30 cm)., Walking exposes your baby to new environments and objects. As you walk them around, you can talk about the different things that they encounter.While your baby may not understand the words, this activity provides an important foundation for later communication and development. Your baby may be content looking at you or the objects. Let the baby focus on whatever they want to during this time. You can:


Walk around your home
Go around your neighborhood
Visit a park
Go on errands

, Tummy time is a short period when your baby lies or plays on their stomach. Tummy time is important to build a baby’s motor skills and to prevent flat spots on their head, but it can only be done while the baby is alert. Start by resting your baby on their stomach across your lap. Do this for three or four minutes. Build up to fifteen or twenty minutes a day. You can also drape a blanket or place a mat on the ground, and have them play on the ground.Always supervise your baby during tummy time.
Some babies may fuss at first during tummy time. Stop tummy time, and try again later. It is important to do a little bit every day so that they can build their muscles in their back, neck, and arms.
Never leave your baby to sleep on their stomach. Always rest them on their back while they sleep. If your baby looks as though they are about to fall asleep during tummy time, pick them up, and let them nap in their crib on their back. This will decrease their risk of SIDS., While your baby is peaceful and quiet, you can read them stories. This activity will help you bond while helping them learn more words.Board books are ideal for babies. These are illustrated stories printed on thick paperboard so that your baby can play with the book without damaging it. Your baby may turn the pages as you read or they may be content to listen to you as you speak.

Watch for signs of active alert time.,
Introduce toys.,
Show your baby their reflection.,
Place them in a bouncy seat.",How to Maximize Your Baby's Alert Time2," Active alert time often follows after quiet alert time. Your baby may be showing more frequent and active movements. In active alert time, your baby will move their legs, arms, body, or head. They might be looking around the room. Babies in active alert time tend to be more interested in objects than in people. This is a good time to play with your baby and have them interact with the environment.Babies in quiet alert time are often quiet and relatively still, whereas babies in active alert time may be making sounds or larger movements.

, Baby toys such as mobiles, soft picture books, and stuffed animals can help your baby engage their senses. Choose toys that have high contrast colors (such as toys in black, white, and red).Let the baby play with one toy at a time to avoid overstimulation.You can introduce toys during tummy time to maximize their engagement.


Up to three months of age, babies are content with toys that are interesting to look at. They will not be able to hold or grasp an object very well, although they might enjoy reaching for it. Wind chimes, mirrors, and mobiles are good choices.Between three and six months, your baby will enjoy grasping and feeling objects. Soft stuffed animals, board books, and rattles will engage their senses.After six months, your baby may enjoy playing with books, balls, or any other object that they can interact with, such as a toy telephone or squeaky toys.If your baby starts crying, looking away, or yawning, it is a sign that they are done playing with the toy. Put it away until their next alert time.

, Many babies love looking in the mirror. As they grow older, they will become more and more fascinated by their reflection. Pick your baby up, and show them a mirror. Let them interact with the mirror by having them point, wave, or touch their reflection.If you have a baby seat or gym, you can attach a mirror to it so that your baby can look at it while sitting., If you have chores or other things to do while your baby is alert, you can put them in a bouncy seat or swing. If your baby is old enough to play, they will entertain themselves with the attached toys. If they’re still an infant, they may be content to watch you as you go about your activities.


You can hang a mobile over them while they are in their seat. They may be fascinated by the objects, and as they grow, they may learn to interact with them.Don't use walkers, as they are a safety risk and don't help your child develop proper walking skills.

Keep a sleep log.,
Make sure they get enough sleep.,
Put the baby to bed early.,
Look for signs of drowsiness.",How to Maximize Your Baby's Alert Time3," A sleep log will help you manage how much sleep your baby is getting. It can also help you plan a routine for your baby so that they get enough sleep as well as plenty of alert time. There are programs and apps that can help you keep track of their sleep schedule, but you can also create your own chart.Make sure to note:


What time your baby falls asleep
What time they woke up
How long they slept for
How often they wake up at night
Why they woke up (hungry, dirty diaper, etc.)
What they were doing before they fell asleep (feeding, playing, crying, etc.)

, Babies who do not have enough sleep may be cranky, fussy, or upset during their alert time. While sleep cannot prevent all fussiness, it can help increase the length of time that your baby is alert and not crying.


Newborns generally sleep about eight to nine hours during the day. They can sleep up to eight hours at night, although they will typically wake every two to three hours to feed.Ideal wake times for newborns are 45 to 60 minutes at a time. By the time they’re six months old, they may be awake for two to two and a half hours at a time. At a year old, they may be awake for between three and four hours at a time., Even if the baby is not sleeping through the night yet, it is important to set an early bedtime. This will create an important sleep routine for your baby, and it will ensure that they are getting enough rest. You may want to put your baby to bed between 6 and 8 PM.Just because you put your baby to bed later does not necessarily mean that they will sleep in later. Your baby may just wake up cranky and fussy, minimizing the amount of alert time they have for that day.If your baby is taking naps in the early evening, it may delay their bedtime. Try waking your baby up early in the morning to encourage them to take naps earlier in the day. You can also put them down for a nap a bit earlier than usual., Near the end of your baby’s alert time, you may notice them becoming sleepy. At this point, you should put your baby in their crib to take a nap, rather than waiting until they are asleep or almost asleep. Do not try to keep them awake longer than they want to be; while they may get a second wind, there is a good chance that they will be cranky or that they will cry more easily.Some signs of sleepiness include:


Yawning
Rubbing eyes
Fussing or crying
Looking away from youStretching
Becoming quiet, calm, or inactive
Flicking or touching their ear"

Put your baby to sleep on their back.,
Avoid putting your baby on their side or stomach.,
Create a safe sleep environment.,
Avoid relying too much on baby monitors.,
Practice relaxation techniques.",How to Handle Your Baby Rolling over at Night1," You should put your baby to sleep on their back for the first year of their life. Although your baby may roll over during the night, it is recommended to put them to sleep on their back. By putting them to sleep on their back, you will reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.Try extending one arm. If you are really worried about them turning over onto their belly, you could extend one of their arms. This will make them a bit less likely to roll onto their stomach.;
, When you put your baby to sleep at night, you should avoid putting them on their side or stomach. There is a greater risk of sudden infant death syndrome when a baby is put to sleep on their side or stomach. If your baby is not yet able to roll over and has little head and neck strength, putting them to sleep in these positions can lead to smothering or suffocation., You should use a fitted sheet on a firm mattress and avoid leaving objects in the crib. Fit the sheet to the mattress and then take out any toys, blankets, pillows or other extraneous objects from the crib. In addition, you should avoid the use of a sleep positioner.


Avoid using a sheet that is either too large or too small for the mattress, since this may disrupt your baby’s sleep and could entangle or suffocate the baby.At bedtime, the crib should be empty aside from your baby. This precaution helps to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.You should avoid the use of a sleep positioner to keep your baby on their back. The use of a sleep positioner can increase the risk of suffocation. If you own a sleep positioner, you should get rid of it., Baby monitors stream information on baby sleeping position, heart rate and breathing to your smart phone. However, there is no evidence that they help reduce sudden infant death syndrome. You should stick to proven approaches to reducing sudden infant death syndrome such as putting your baby to sleep on their back, keeping foreign objects out of the crib, using a fitted sheet and avoiding soft bedding., Once you have put your baby to sleep, you could try a few relaxation techniques to reduce any anxiety related to your baby rolling over at night. Take a few deep breaths, enjoy a bath with Epsom salts or do a few nighttime stretches.


Epsom salt baths are very relaxing and are especially beneficial for muscle aches and pains.
Shoulder shrugs are a nice way to relieve tension in your neck and shoulders. Lift your shoulders up to your ears, hold them for a couple seconds and then let them fall back down. Repeat this stretch a few times before bed."

Consult your doctor.,
Determine whether your baby can roll over on their tummy.,
Notice whether they can roll over onto their back.,
Observe head and neck strength.",How to Handle Your Baby Rolling over at Night2," You should talk to your doctor about your baby’s development. Consider asking them a few questions about handling roll over:


Do you think my baby is strong enough to safely roll over at night?
When will my baby be able to roll over during the day?
Should I worry about my baby rolling over at night?
What can I do to prevent sudden infant death syndrome?

, If your baby is able to roll over onto their tummy during the daytime, under supervision, they should have enough strength to roll over at nighttime. If your baby is strong enough to roll over during the day, you do not need to worry about them rolling over at night. You should still put them to sleep on their back but don’t worry if they happen to roll over onto their tummy during the night.Your baby should learn to roll over by about six months of age., Watch your baby play on their tummy during the day. During playtime, observe whether they can roll over from their tummy onto their back. If they can rock back and forth with enough strength to successfully roll over back onto their back, you don’t need to worry about them rolling onto their tummy at night. They should have enough strength to roll back on their back., If your baby is strong enough to hold up their own head and roll over, they should be strong enough to handle rolling over during the night. You should still put them to sleep on their back but don’t worry if they roll over at night.To improve their strength, you should incorporate some supervised time on their tummy during the day. By spending time on their tummy, they will develop strong neck, chest and arm muscles, which will improve their ability to hold up their own head.If your baby is one month old, they should be able to hold up their head briefly while lying on their stomach.By the age of two months, your baby should be able to lift their head forty-five degrees.At four months, your baby should be able to lift their head ninety-degrees and hold their head level."

Ask your partner for help.,
Determine whether they have rolled over on their own.,
Relax if they have the strength to roll over.,
Go back to sleep.",How to Handle Your Baby Rolling over at Night3," If you have a partner, you should consider asking them for help with the baby. If you are losing sleep, they can help you by responding to the baby some of the time. They might also be able to put the baby to sleep some of the time. Consider asking:


Can you respond to the baby the next time they wake up?
Can you put the baby to sleep next time?

, If your baby is under four months of age, which is the riskiest stage for sudden infant death syndrome, they may not be able to roll over on their own. If they were put to sleep on their side, they could fall over onto their tummy without having the strength to completely roll over on their own. In addition, there may be some other cause for them being on their stomach. In any case, you should put them on their back since this is the recommended position to avoid sudden infant death syndrome.To avoid this scenario, remember to put them to sleep on their back., If your baby is already rolling over during playtime during the day, which usually happens around four or five months of age, they may start rolling over onto their stomach at night. If your baby has the strength to roll over and hold up their own head, they will also have the strength to adjust themselves at night. You should just relax and let them find a comfortable sleeping position., If your baby is strong enough to roll over onto their stomach and onto their back, you don’t need to worry about your baby rolling over at night. Typically, if they are rolling over at night they are usually past the riskiest stage for sudden infant death syndrome. Since they are strong enough to roll back over onto their back, you should avoid waking up every time your baby rolls over onto their stomach. Relax and go back to sleep."

Alter the temperature of the room.,
Position your baby's crib in an ideal location.,
Choose a certified crib.,
Use a firm mattress.,
Preheat the crib with a hot water bottle or heating pad.,
Dress your infant in pajamas.,
Swaddle your baby.,
Set your baby in the crib in supine position.,
Keep the baby's crib clean and clear of clutter.,
Keep your baby from overheating.",How to Keep a Baby Warm in a Crib," Your baby’s nursery should be a comfortable and safe place to rest. You can help your baby rest well by setting the nursery’s temperature to support a restful, healthy environment.


It is recommended that your baby’s nursery should be maintained at a temperature of 68-72 °F (°20-22.2 °C) in order to keep it safe and comfortable.;
, The position of your baby’s crib in the nursery affects how much heat your baby experiences. Keep in mind the different factors that affect the temperature in his room when you are placing furniture in his nursery.


Your baby’s crib should be several feet away from drafty windows, air vents, fans and heaters so that he is not directly bathing in the cool or hot air.Keep your baby away from drafty windows especially if there are curtain cords that might blow in the wind. These cords pose a potential strangulation hazard to your baby., You should only use a certified crib that does not pose hazards to your baby. The bars should not be too narrow or wide so that any of the infant’s body parts get stuck, and there should be no dangling objects that might pose a strangulation or choking hazards.Look for a Children’s Product Certificate (CPC) when choosing a crib and only purchase used cribs that come with this certificate. According to the new regulations, cribs sold at stores after 2011 must comply with the new federal crib safety standards.The crib should also be stable with a firm sleeping surface that supports back sleeping.Your baby can sleep in a crib in your room, but should not co-sleep in a bed or chair with you or another person, as this increases your baby’s risk of smothering and overheating., Your baby should sleep on a firm crib mattress that is not too plush. Mattresses made of too soft material can present a smothering hazard.A firm mattress supports back sleeping, which has been linked to decreased risk of SIDS. Your infant may choose to sleep on her stomach after she learns to roll over at six months.Keep your baby warm on her firm mattress by using a tight, fitted flannel sheet. The sheet should not bunch up, as it could cover your baby’s nose and mouth and increase their risk of suffocation., You may want to preheat the crib if it is very cold in the house. The best thing you can do is make the nursery warm enough so that your baby can comfortably sleep in lightweight pajamas without heavy blankets.Place a hot water bottle or electric blanket in the baby’s crib for a small amount of time before he goes down to sleep. Make sure that you remove it before you place him in the crib to prevent overheating and burns.Do not leave an electric blanket in your baby’s crib. This can cause him to overheat. Young infants are unable to regulate their own baby temperature, so you must be very careful. You should not use loose blankets in the crib at all to reduce the risk of SIDS., Your baby’s pajamas should support warm and comfortable sleep, while being safe. Make sure that you are not dressing your infant too warmly, especially if the room temperature is elevated.


Dress your baby in lightweight pajamas that cover most of her body if you are worried about keeping her cozy. These are sometimes known as “onesies.”According to the SIDS prevention guidelines, a baby should ideally not be dressed in more than one layer, or no more layers than an adult in a similar environment.If you will swaddle your baby, only use a thin onesie to prevent overheating.

, Swaddling helps your baby maintain body heat and allows her to sleep comfortably on her back. You can purchase a swaddling blanket with easy-to-use closures or use a square light-weight blanket to make your own swaddle.Diagonally fold a square lightweight blanket into a triangle shape.
Lay the baby in the middle of the triangle with her feet toward the bottom point.
Pull one side of the blanket over the baby’s chest. You may choose to leave your baby’s arm free to suck on their fingers.
Flip the bottom point over the baby’s feet up toward the chest.
Bring the last corner up over the baby’s chest, wrapping it securely but not too tight.

, Sleeping position is a factor that increases the risk of SIDS. Placing your baby in supine position (on his back) is considered the best and safest sleeping position.Avoid putting your baby to sleep on his stomach or side. Putting your baby to sleep on his stomach or side increases his risk of choking or suffocating on his clothing and bedding., A clear crib is a safe crib. Do not use blankets and other loose materials in the crib that may cause suffocation. You can keep your baby warm with a lightweight blanket that is tucked into the foot of their mattress and reaches no further than her armpits.Soft toys and loose blankets present smothering hazards for your baby and increase your baby’s risk of SIDS.Your baby should not sleep with a pillow. If your baby turns her head in her sleep, she could smother on the loose edges of the pillow or pillowcase., Your baby can become dehydrated if he overheats and sweats too much. Overheating has also been linked with increased risk of SIDS.Some cases of SIDS have been linked to infants overheating. Make sure you keep an eye on your baby’s temperature to make sure it does not get higher than 100 °F (37.7 °C).Regulate the temperature in your baby’s nursery and monitor your baby for signs of overheating, such as sweat on his chest or in his hairline.Do not cover your baby’s face with a blanket or over-bundle your baby. The baby should be clothed or wrapped in no more than one layer than adults are wearing in the same temperatures.In warm weather, your baby may only need to sleep in a light onesie or even just a diaper.

Talk to your baby's pediatrician if you have concerns.If your baby continues to have a hard time falling or staying asleep, then you should talk to your baby's pediatrician.",How to Increase the Length of Time Your Baby Sleeps," Adults who are busy and active throughout the day expend more energy, and consequently tend to sleep better at night, and the same is true of babies. While babies are too young for most activities, you can encourage wakefulness during the day by talking to your baby, singing to your baby, and stimulating your baby with sounds, visual aids, and play., There are several reasons why getting outside with your baby is important, and one of them is that fresh air can clean out the lungs. It can also increase oxygen intake, and this will help your baby sleep more soundly.Another reason to get outside is that exposure to natural light will help your baby’s internal clock regulate itself faster, meaning she’ll adjust faster to sleeping through the night.If you can't get outside for play and activities, open the windows to allow some fresh air inside.

, While it may seem counterintuitive, making sure your baby gets enough sleep during the day will actually help her sleep better at night. The reason for this is that babies do need quite a bit of sleep each day, and restricting their daytime sleep will make them overtired, which will make it harder for them to fall asleep at night.To promote daytime sleep, you may have to use motion to help your baby nap. This could include using a swing or carrier, a car ride, or rocking., Recognize and look for signs of sleepiness throughout the day, and when you spot them, get your baby down for a nap as soon as possible! Again, this will ensure she gets enough sleep during the day, and isn't overtired when it comes time to go down for the night. Signs of tiredness include:Rubbing the eyes and tugging on the ears
Becoming whiny and tearful
Blank staring, stillness, and quietness
Yawning and stretching

, The sleep and wake patterns of babies and newborns are governed by hunger, feeding, and digestion.Therefore, the fuller your baby is when she goes to sleep at night, the longer her food will take to digest, and the longer she’ll sleep.


In the couple hours leading up to bedtime, start cluster feeding your baby by feeding her every hour, and then once again right before bed., Around 12 weeks, babies can begin to develop a regular circadian rhythm that’s dictated by the cycle of night and day.This means early on in life, your baby can start getting used to a bedtime routine that will signal sleep is coming soon.


You can start with a bedtime routine around three months, and aim for between 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m.Soothing bedtime activities include a bath, cuddles, reading, and quiet music or singing., To help teach your baby how to soothe herself to sleep at bedtime and during the night, put her down in her crib or bed when she's drowsy but still awake. Lay her down on her back, and make sure the area is free of pillows, blankets, toys, and other objects.You can start allowing your baby to put herself to sleep around six to eight weeks of age., A pacifier could help your baby settle quicker and fall asleep faster, and there's also evidence suggesting that pacifiers can reduce the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome).You may have to stop using the pacifier, however, if the baby wakes and can't get back to sleep when she drops it., One of the worst culprits for a baby’s disrupted sleep is the intense pain caused by teething. To help soothe her gums, try a gum massage with your finger, or talk to a doctor or pharmacist about an infant analgesic.Babies generally start teething between six and 10 months.
Signs of teething include low grade fever, drooling, and red, swollen gums.

, As your baby adjusts to a night and day cycle, her body’s hormones will become sensitive to light and dark. The same way that adults need darkness at night to produce melatonin and sleep properly, so too is your baby’s body developing this same need.


Keep your baby’s room as dark as possible when it’s time to sleep, and only use minimal lighting if you need to tend to her in the night.This will prevent her from waking fully, and will make it easier to get her back to sleep.
During the day, don’t try to darken the house when your baby naps, or her body could become confused., Babies who are put to sleep in rooms that are too warm may overheat quickly and not sleep well. Keep her room around 70 F (21 C) to promote a sound sleep., It may be inevitable that your baby wakes during the night, especially if she's still feeding every couple hours. However, you can make it easier to get her back to sleep by not rousing her into a wakeful state.


When you go into her room at night, keep the lights dim, make as little noise as possible, don’t make eye contact, and use calm movements and a quiet voice., When your baby does stir in the night, allow her to put herself back to sleep, if possible. Instead of rushing in when she stirs, wait a few moments before going to her. This will hopefully teach her to soothe herself back to sleep, which will be a useful ability throughout her entire life.You can start doing this with your baby once she’s four to five months. If she doesn’t settle herself after a couple minutes, then go to her.For babies who are six months and older, one method you can try is called the Ferber method. When your baby cries, go to her, give her a gentle pat, and then leave. Even if she continues to cry, wait five minutes before checking on her again and giving her another pat. Leave again, and next time wait 10 minutes before going to her. Continue increasing the amount of time between visits by five minutes., On the other end of the spectrum from Ferber’s self-soothing method is the attachment parenting style, where parents use physical closeness to bond and promote sleep. While many experts do not recommend co-sleeping (sleeping in the same bed) for safety reasons,you can keep your baby’s crib in the same room as yours.Along with helping you and baby bond, this will also ensure you’re available immediately throughout the night, which could help your baby from becoming too awake if she needs something.

, If your baby is waking often in the night, there may be issues you can address that will make her more comfortable and keep her asleep longer. These could include:Wet diapers. If your baby wakes often because of a wet diaper, try a more absorbent nighttime diaper.
Sleepwear that’s not comfortable. Allergies, dyes, and scratchy fabrics can all make babies uncomfortable, and this could stop yours from sleeping soundly. Try natural fibers like undyed cotton if you suspect this problem.
Environmental irritants, such as dust, smoke, baby powder, and perfume can all cause congestion in a baby’s sensitive breathing passages. Make sure your baby’s room is clean and free of common irritants (such as plants, feathers, wool), if she often wakes with a stuffy nose.

, Sleep regressions are periods when a sleep-trained baby or toddler begins to wake frequently in the night again. These regressions can last anywhere from one to four weeks, and they often occur around four months, between eight and 12 months, at the 18-month mark, and the final one around two years of age. To manage sleep regressions, try:Providing extra food during the day or, rarely, at night. Sleep regressions can often be caused by growth spurts, during which time your baby’s body needs extra fuel.
Offering extra physical comfort, such as a few extra cuddles, pats, or kisses as your baby is getting ready for bed, or as your baby tries to get back to sleep in the night.
Getting your baby to bed at an earlier hour. Because sleep regressions disrupt normal sleep patterns, they can cause your baby to become overtired, and this makes sleep even more elusive.

, Ongoing sleep problems may be a sign of a different problem that will need to be addressed to help your baby sleep more.

Have consistency in your child's sleep routine.It is important to have the same bedtime every night, with little variation (note that a slight exception on days like weekends or special occasions, such as going to bed 30 minutes later, is okay; it is large variations that you will want to avoid).,
Perform the same bedtime routine every night.Another step you can take to help your child sleep through the night is to have the same bedtime routine every night.,
Avoid screen time before bed.,
Optimize your child's sleeping environment.Make sure your child's room is dark, and install room-darkening shades or blackout curtains if needed.,
Put your child to sleep when she is drowsy, but not overtired.Interestingly enough, if a child is overtired, she is less likely to sleep well through the night.,
Watch what your child eats before bed.,
Allow your child to become attached to a stuffed animal.From the age of six months onward, it is advisable to get your child a stuffed animal or a blanket that she can become attached to.,
Be aware of the impact of having a second child.Many parents notice that their first child's sleeping pattern becomes disrupted with the presence of a new baby in the home.",How to Get Your Child to Sleep Through the Night1," Consistency in bedtime helps to optimize your child's sleeping routine, training her brain to recognize when it is time to fall asleep and when it is time to wake up.


In addition to consistent bedtimes, you will also want to have consistent wake-up times (again, within half an hour or so).
Sleeping in on weekends (on non-school days) is not a good idea, especially if your child is having trouble sleeping through the night, as you don't want her to be over-rested.;
, This helps to get your child in the right frame of mind before bed, increasing the chances that he will sleep through the night without disturbances. Many parents will read one or two stories before bed, and some will give their child a warm, relaxing bath.


The important thing about before bed activities is that you ideally want them to be relaxing, and ones that put your child in a positive frame of mind (i.e. activities that help to soothe your child's mind before putting him to sleep).
It is also ideal if before bed activities involve connection time between you and your child. Giving him this attention before he goes to sleep can help to prevent nighttime disturbances or crying out that may result from your child's longing for additional connection time with you.

, Studies have shown that time spent in front of a screen — be it a television screen, a computer, a cellphone, or a video game — diminishes the natural production of melatonin in the brain (a chemical that helps with sleep and circadian rhythm). Therefore, screen time before bed has been linked to troubles falling asleep, as well as troubles staying asleep. If possible, establish alternative pre-bedtime routines with your child from a young age, such as reading stories together or giving your child a bath.

, A dark environment signals the brain that it is time to sleep, so it can help your child both with falling asleep as well as staying asleep through the night.


Also, if you live in a home or neighbourhood that is noisy or has disruptive sounds, consider installing a source of white noise or playing a tape with white noise on it in your child's room. This may help to drown out some of the noises that may previously have contributed to awakening your child during the night.
Make sure the room is a comfortable temperature — not too warm or too cold.

, She also miss out on learning the important life skill of falling asleep (and the self-soothing skills that accompany this). Therefore, it is best to put your child to sleep when she is drowsy, and to let her be alone as she actually falls asleep.


On a similar note, it is important not to cut down on your child's daytime naps until she is sleeping through the night.
Contrary to popular belief, cutting down on naps too soon has a negative impact on a child's sleeping pattern.
Once your child is sleeping through the night, you can cut down from two naps to one, and then from one nap to zero; however, be sure to only make these changes once sleeping through the night is not an issue.

, You don't want to feed your child sugar-filled foods right before bed. This will contribute to what is commonly known as a ""sugar high,"" which is when your child has excess energy due to a sudden spike in his blood sugar levels. Needless to say, this is an effect you will want to avoid at bedtime.


On another note, you also don't want your child to go to bed hungry. Insufficient food may cause him to awaken in the middle of the night out of hunger. Therefore, ensure that your child has had enough calories before bed to get him through the night.
Try not to feed your child within the 30 to 60 minutes leading up to bedtime (unless he is an infant).

, This will serve two purposes: it will first of all give your child a sense of company while falling asleep, and secondly it can provide a sense of happiness surrounding the idea of going to sleep if your child feels like she will be accompanied by a ""little friend.""

, One of the reasons for this is that the older child may feel ""second best,"" and have a heightened desire for parental attention, leading to potential outbursts and crying during the night. If you are planning to have a second child, make sure your first child is transitioned to his new sleeping place at least two months prior to the arrival of the new child (if this change will require your older child to move rooms or to go from a crib into a bed).


You do not want to the older child to feel ""displaced"" with the arrival of the new baby.
Also, as this transition is going on, be sure to involve your older child in your baby's life in an age-appropriate way. This will help to give your older child a sense of responsibility and importance, and it will allow him to still feel valued in your eyes.

Have a plan for middle-of-the-night disturbances.If your child has been waking up in the middle of the night, it is important that you (and your partner) discuss a plan in advance for how you will handle these outbursts when they arise.,
Do not invite your child into your bed.When their child has trouble sleeping through the night, some parents resort to inviting the child to sleep in their bed.,
Do not rock your child back to sleep.Another coping pattern that parents may resort to is rocking their child back to sleep.,
Avoid reinforcing negative behaviors such as crying.If your child cries in the middle of the night, ideally you would ignore her and allow her to self-soothe until she falls back to sleep.,
Remain focused on the long-term goal.When it comes to a child who cannot sleep through the night, it is easy to become distressed and disillusioned with the challenges of the moment.",How to Get Your Child to Sleep Through the Night2," Your thinking likely won't be at its sharpest in the middle of the night, so having a plan in place can diminish the stress you feel and also ensure that you respond consistently every time if and when your child has trouble sleeping through the night.

, It can appear to be the only (or the easiest) way to soothe them and to help them fall back asleep. However, if you are looking to actually resolve the problem, inviting your child into your bed is not the solution. This will simply promote bad sleeping habits, as your child is actually being rewarded for waking up in the middle of the night.


Inviting your child into your bed also fails to teach her the important life skill of learning how to put herself back to sleep, should she awake in the middle of the night.

, This is another counter-productive behavior, as it prevents your child from learning to fall asleep on his own.

, If you rush to get up at the sound of crying and immediately comfort your little one, you will be inadvertently reinforcing the negative sleep pattern by rewarding awakening in the night.


The exception is if your child is crying more than usual, has an unusual cry, or is currently ill, you may want to check to make sure your child is not uncomfortable or in pain, and does not have a dirty diaper.
Even if you only respond to the crying once in awhile, the reinforcement effect is still just as strong (if not stronger).
This is because ""intermittent reinforcement"" (a behavior that is rewarded with attention sometimes but not always) actually registers as the strongest form of reinforcement in the brain.
Therefore, if you respond to your child's crying by soothing her, it will develop pathways in your child's brain that this behavior is one to continue (when it happens to be the very behavior that you are trying to cut out).

, However, it is key to keep your mind focused on long-term success. What you are aiming to teach your child is the self-soothing skills of learning how to fall asleep, including how to fall back asleep after an awakening during the night.


With dedication and consistency in your approach, your child will learn this; however, it is not something that will change overnight.
Remain committed to teaching your child this important life skill, and trust that with time your child will adapt.

Get some soft, fleece fabric.,
Cut about 3 yards of soft, fleece fabric.,
Cut a 24 inch (60.96 centimeters) wide strip off the bottom.,
Cut the strip in half.,
Fold the big rectangle in half.,
Cut an oval into the fabric.,
Sew the sleeves.,
Turn the sleeves inside out.,
Pin the sleeves to the ovals in the big rectangle.,
Sew the sleeves in place using a zigzag stitch.,
Consider hemming the snuggie.,
Cut one of the ovals you cut out earlier in half widthwise.,
Consider hemming the straight edge.,
Pin the pockets to the snuggie.,
Topstitch the pockets down.",How to Make a Snuggie," The benefit of fleece is that it does not need to be hemmed. If you do want to hem it, however, you'll need to use a stitch meant for stretchy fabrics, such as a narrow zigzag stitch.


If you must use a straight stitch, use a longer, basting length one.;
, Your piece should measure 60 by 108 inches (152.4 by 274.32 centimeters). A very tall person might need a longer piece of fabric.


If this snuggie is for a child, start with a piece of fabric that is 2 to 2.5 yards long. The width should stay the same: 60 inches (152.4 centimeters).

, The big rectangle should now measure 60 by 84 inches (152.4 by 213.36 centimeters). The strip should measure 24 by 60 inches (60.96 by 152.4 centimeters).


If this is for a child, cut a 20 inch (50.8 centimeters) strip off the bottom., Bring the narrow ends together, and cut along the fold. You will end up with two 24 by 30 inch (60.96 by 76.2 centimeters) strips. These will eventually become your sleeves.


If you have shorter arms, trim the rectangles down to 24 by 24 inch (60.96 by 60.96 centimeters) squares.If this is for a child, cut your strip down to 20 by 20 inch (50.8 by 50.8 centimeters) squares.

, Bring the wide ends together and flatten the fabric so that you end up with a long, skinny rectangle.

, Measure 13 inch (33.02 centimeters) down from the top, and 11 inches (27.94 centimeters) from the folded edge. Cut an oval that is 9 inches (22.86 centimeters) tall and 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) wide. Cut through both layers of fabric.


Consider setting the scraps aside to make pockets later.If this is for a child, measure 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) down from the top, and 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) from the fold. Make the oval 4¾ inches (12.07 centimeters) wide and 6 ½ inches (16.51 centimeters) tall.
These are standard measurements. To make your snuggie perfectly sized for you, measure across your shoulders, and divide that measurement in half. This is how far from the folded edge your ovals will be., Fold the little rectangles in half, lengthwise, and sew along the long edge using a 5/8 inch (1.59 centimeters) seam allowance. If this is for a child, you might need a larger seam allowance, bout 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Tie the ends of the threads into tight knots, and snip off the excess.


Choose a strong, polyester thread in a color that closely matches your fleece., At this point, you can hem the sleeves. Fold one of the ends on each sleeve inward by 1 to 3 inches (2.54 to 7.62 centimeters). Pin the hem down, and sew it with a zigzag stitch. Tie the ends of the threads into tight knots and snip off the tail ends.


These are standard measurements. If you want shorter sleeves, use a deeper hem. If you want longer sleeves, use a smaller hem.

, Make sure that the top/folded part of each sleeve is facing the top part of the big rectangle. The bottom seams should be facing the bottom part of the big rectangle.

, Tie the ends of the treads into tight knots, and snip off the excess.

, Fleece does not fray, so it does not need to be hemmed; however, not everyone likes the look of raw edges. You can hem your snuggie to give it a more professional finish. Simply fold the top, bottom, and side edges inward by ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters). Pin them in place, and sew them down using a zigzag stitch. Tie the ends of the thread off, and snip off the excess.


If this is for a child, consider using a deeper hem along the bottom. This way, you can lower the hem as the child grows.

, You can cut the ovals straight across, or at a slight angle. If you are making multiple snuggies, consider mixing and matching the pockets for added contrast.

, This will give your pockets a more finished look. It will also prevent the fleece from stretching out too much. Use a ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters) hem and a zigzag stitch. Remember to tie the ends of the threads off, and to snip away any excess.

, Put the snuggie on how you intend to wear it, and decide where the most comfortable pocket placement would be for you. Most pockets should be placed several inches/centimeters above the sleeve cuff, but some people might prefer their pockets lower.


Make sure that the hem is facing inward.

, You can use a straight stitch for this. Sew along only the curved edge, and not the top/straight edge. Sew as close to the raw edge as you can.

Let the sun in.,
Increase your thermostat slightly.,
Heat up the room with a space heater.,
Install insulating curtains.,
Seal the windows.,
Close the door.",How to Keep Your Baby's Room Warm1," If it is a nice sunny day, especially one where the sun shines into the room, leave the curtains open for some natural light and heat.The natural light will be good for your baby, and cost you less money than running various heating appliances.


If there are tree branches in front of your windows, you can consider trimming the branches to let more light into the room. Just make sure the trees are on your property, and you aren’t cutting down someone else’s branches.;
, The temperature in your baby’s room should be warm enough for a lightly clothed adult, around 70 to 72 degrees. This will probably be a little bit higher than you have it around the rest of your house, which is okay.Having a thermostat in the baby's room is a good option because it will help to regulate the temperature in the room, and prevent it from getting too warm.

, If you need some heat quickly, say the room is really cold, you can consider using a space heater. If you do use a space heater in the room, make sure it is at least 3 feet away from anything that could burn, and that you turn it off when you leave the room or the baby is sleeping.Make sure that your baby doesn’t get near the heater, as it can burn skin very easily.

, Thermal, or insulating, curtains are another good way to keep warm air in your baby’s room. Attach the curtains as close as you can the windows, and let them fall onto the windowsill, or even the floor. Make sure you close them at night to prevent heat from escaping through the window., Leaky windows will let heat escape and cold air in, making your baby’s room colder than it needs to be. Plus, you’ll be spending extra money on heating as you try to keep the temperature up. Attach weather stripping, caulk, or other sealants to your windows to keep warm air in the room, and drafts out.If possible, you should also replace old, drafty windows with new, sealed ones.

, Once you have some way of heating the room, you can help trap the heat in the room by closing the door. This will keep the baby’s room particularly warm, especially nice if you like it a little cooler in the rest of the house. You’ll also save a little money if you are using a space heater or something similar, as it won’t need to work as hard to heat the enclosed area."

Clothe your baby’s whole body.,
Layer your baby’s clothing.,
Use a blanket in the crib.,
Warm the bed before putting your baby in it.,
Check your baby for signs of overheating.",How to Keep Your Baby's Room Warm2," When you put your baby down to sleep, make sure he or she is fully covered. One-piece sleeper pajamas with feet and a skullcap should be enough to keep your baby warm while sleeping. If you want an extra layer, include a onesie or undershirt under the pajamas., Several thin layers of clothing should help keep your baby warm, and if your baby starts to overheat, they are easier to remove. A good rule of thumb is to give your baby one more layer of clothing than an adult would wear at the same temperature., Another way to keep your baby warm in the crib is to include a blanket while he or she is sleeping. For all of these sheets and blankets, remember that they should be tight against the crib and your baby. Loose blankets are dangerous to a sleeping baby.Therefore, you should just have one blanket for your baby's crib.


Use a fitted flannel sheet for the crib, especially during the winter. Flannel is a nice, thick material that holds heat well. When using a blanket, make sure you can tuck it into the mattress so that is doesn’t come loose, and doesn’t make the mattress uneven. Make sure it comes no higher than your baby’s armpits.

, If the room is still warming, your baby’s bed may be a bit cool before you put him or her into it. If that’s the case, you can use a hot water bottle, heating pad, or microwaveable bag. Let it sit on the bed for a few minutes to get everything warm. Just remember to remove it before you put your baby down., Once you have gotten the room to a nice temperature, you’ll still need to keep an eye on your baby to make sure he or she stays comfortable while in the room. Don’t be afraid to touch your baby’s chest, back, and abdomen to track the temperature. Keep an eye out for the signs of overheating, and if you notice them, remove clothing, turn off heaters, and find other ways to cool down the room.An overheated baby will be damp or moist from sweat, particularly his or her hair, back, and chest. The baby may also have red ears, a rapid pulse, and maybe even a fever.

Use a firm mattress with thin, tight sheets.,
Place baby on his back.,
Keep extra items out of the bed.,
Keep any cords away from the crib.",How to Keep Your Baby's Room Warm3," A loose sheet or blanket can be a choking hazard. If you do use one, make sure it is tightly tucked under the mattress, and reaches up to the baby’s chest. Always be careful about keeping things away from the baby’s head.A good mattress in a playpen is also going to be thin, which is safer for the baby. Your baby’s face can get stuck in the extra padding. Softer mattresses can be pressed away from the edges of the crib, which creates gaps with the side of the crib that the baby can get stuck in., Whenever the baby is sleeping, he needs to be on his back to allow clear breathing. This position drastically reduces the chances of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Research is limited on why this is the case, but it is believed that an infant sleeping on his stomach will get less oxygen because he is “rebreathing” the air from around the nose., This means extra pillows, blankets, and toys, especially if the child is 4 months and younger. On the soft mattress, these items can roll around and cover or hurt the baby.If you have toys that attach to the side of the crib, make sure they are secure, and don’t have any dangling or protruding parts. The child can use these to climb out of the crib, or detach small parts that he might choke on.If your baby is sleeping in another carrier, like a car seat, do not put the carrier into the crib. On an uneven surface like a mattress, the carrier can flip over and hurt your baby.
If your baby needs to have his head lifted while sleeping, talk to your doctor or pediatrician about the best ways to accomplish that. If you need to raise the mattress, make sure there are no gaps around the perimeter, and the that angle is low so the baby can’t roll off the mattress.

, Cords are dangerous, as children can tug, pull, and climb on them. The cords can also wrap around their necks and strangle them. Keep the baby’s crib or bed away from corded window coverings, as well as electrical wires for things such as lamps, baby monitors, and night lights.Get cordless equipment whenever possible. If you can’t get items without cords, make sure the crib is at least 3 feet away from any cords.

Use verbal cues to prepare your infant for bed.,
Have physical cues for bedtime.,
Do a calming activity with your infant before bed.,
Stick to the same routine every night.",How to Help Your Blind or Visually Impaired Infant Sleep1," Because your blind or visually impaired child cannot see light (or cannot see it well), you will need to create cues to let them know it’s time for bed. Create verbal cues and repeat them to your infant every night at the same time. This can then help your infant prepare for sleep and get used to the same bedtime every night.For example, you may schedule dinner for 6 pm every night. Then, one hour later, at the end of dinner, you can say to your infant, “Time for bedtime now. Let’s get ready for bed and close our eyes to go to sleep.”
You can also remind your infant that is is night time by saying, “It’s night time now” or “It’s 7 pm at night” so they know the time of day. They can then connect the time of day to going to sleep.;
, You can combine verbal cues with physical cues so your infant knows it is time for bed. Have the same physical cues every time your infant goes to bed so they get into a routine. The physical cues will also help them realize what time of day it is and help them prepare for sleep.Remember that infants younger than 3-6 months do not have a regular sleep pattern yet.
Recognize when your baby is showing signs of getting tired and put him to bed, so he will sleep better.
Set patterns by doing stimulating and exciting activities during the day and being more relaxed in the evening.
Give your infant the same or similar meals for dinner so they take this as a cue that it is nighttime and they will be going to bed after the meal.
Try styling your child’s hair in a specific way so they know it’s nighttime. For example, keep their hair down and brush their hair before bed every night to signal it is time for bed.

, Prepare your infant for bed by having sensory toys and items in the bed with them. This could be a plush toy they like or a toy with a pattern or ridged sides. Keep them in bed as they play or touch these items. Having these sensory items can help your infant stay calm and relaxed while they lie down in bed.You can also try reading to your child as they touch the toys to help them stay calm and relaxed. Read the same story to your infant every night as part of their bedtime routine.
Make sure you remove the plush toys in their crib or sleeping area once they are asleep. Never leave your infant alone in their crib with plush toys, as they can be a choking hazard., The key is to be consistent with your infant’s bedtime routine. Commit to the same routine and try not to deviate from it. Tell everyone in your household about the bedtime routine. Write down the routine and post it somewhere you can see it so you know when bedtime is for your infant as well as the verbal and physical cues for bedtime.When your infant goes down for naps during the day, make sure you remind them that is it daytime and they are taking a nap, not going to sleep for the night. You may tell your infant, “It’s 2 pm in the day, time for a quick nap.”

Put adjustable window coverings in their room.,
Reduce any glare in their room.,
Include color in their space.",How to Help Your Blind or Visually Impaired Infant Sleep2," Infants who are visually impaired but have some sight can find rooms with too much light difficult to sleep in. However, you should still allow some natural light to come into their room during the day and then make the room dark at night. Install window coverings that you can adjust, such as adjustable blinds or shutters, so you can control how much light comes into the room during the day and at night.Set up a lamp in their room with a flexible arm so you can control how much light is in the room during your infant’s bedtime routine. As your infant grows, they can move the lamp based on how much light they would prefer in their room at night.

, Infants who have low vision but are not blind might be kept up at night by a glare in their room. Get rid of any surfaces that may cause glare, such as television screens, computer screens, or even tables with a polished surface. Place a dark placement or tablecloth on tables in their room to reduce glare.Play around with the adjustable window coverings to reduce the amount of glare that comes into the room during the day, as glare can be particularly uncomfortable for children who are visually impaired.

, If your infant is visually impaired but still has some sight, they may be sensitive to certain colors in their space. They could have a preferred color, such as blue or red, that they like or respond well to. Have items in their room in their preferred color, such as toys, pillows, or blankets, as they may be more inclined to sleep or relax in their room if it is to their liking.Keep in mind that even infants that are not visually impaired can only see 8-15 inches away.Try using contrasting colors in their room to help your infant see objects better. Put colored images on a white background in their room so they can see the images better. Have pillows and sheets in contrasting colors so they are easier for your child to identify.

Ask your infant’s doctor about melatonin.,
Discuss anxiety or stress issues in your infant.,
Schedule a follow up appointment with your infant’s doctor.,
Seek out support groups for parents of blind infants and children.",How to Help Your Blind or Visually Impaired Infant Sleep3," Infants of at least 4 months who are blind or visually impaired may benefit from small doses of melatonin. Melatonin can help to set your infant’s sleep clock to a normal, regular routine. Speak to your pediatrician before you give your infant melatonin. They should specify the dosage amount for your child as well as how often you should give your child the melatonin. Never give a supplement to your child without consulting with a doctor.Your pediatrician may suggest you give your child melatonin in tablet or liquid form. Often it is given 30 minutes to an hour before the infant’s bedtime.

, Keep in mind melatonin may not work for infants who are blind or visually impaired and have a high level of anxiety or stress. Some infants find going to sleep difficult as well as other daily activities. If this is the case, your infant’s doctor may recommend anti-anxiety strategies for your infant as well as anxiety medication.Your pediatrician should outline the treatment options for infants with anxiety or stress. Medication will be just one option among many you can try to help your child deal with their anxiety.

, If your infant’s doctor recommends that you try melatonin or other medication on your child, make sure you schedule a follow up appointment to check on your infant’s progress. Have a follow up appointment in three to six months with the doctor to determine if the medication is helping and if your infant is sleeping better.


The doctor may recommend lifestyle changes for your infant in addition to medication to ensure they get the best treatment possible.
If the medication does not seem to be working, the doctor may test your blind or visually impaired infant for other issues.

, Sometimes talking to parents who have gone through the same problems can be an invaluable resource. For example, try the National Association of Parents of Children with Visual Impairments or seek out a local group in your area."

Talk with your child about peer pressure.",How to Teach Your Child to Avoid Drugs," Don't believe anything that public service announcements or government commercials say about drugs. Also, don't trust news stories. These are known to exaggerate facts about drugs, or just flat out lie.

Don't listen to anybody.;
, If you tell them that marijuana can kill you, which it can't, then they are bound to find out eventually that it won't. They will be hurt that you lied to them, and will have trouble believing other things you say.

, Adult drug addicts often had troubled childhoods, and weren't happy. Many teenage drug users take drugs because they want to escape their problems. Simply be fair and reasonable with discipline, and make sure your child knows that you love them.

, Often adult drug users have had an extremely traumatic experience in their younger years, such as getting raped or molested, a divorce or death in the family, etc.

, Its important to start before they hit puberty, at the age of about ten. If they are clearly not interested, then try again some other time. Remember not to lie when talking about drugs. Lying to them is like asking them to do drugs.

, Never, ever, ever, EVER tell them not to do drugs. This is especially important in older kids and teenagers. Most teenagers go through phases of rebellion and being ""bad"". When you forbid them not to do something, especially drugs, it only makes them want to do it more. Tell them that drugs can be harmful, and can be addicting, and they can ruin your life, but don't tell them that they cannot do it.

, The knee-jerk reaction is to freak out that they are on drugs, but that is not a good idea. It's a very good thing that they are researching drugs, because that means they are getting the information about drugs you want them to get. Eventually the fascination will go away.

, All children will be pressured at some point, and they should know what to do. Tell your child that if they are in a situation where they feel pressured, the best thing to do is the right thing to do. Tell them not to do anything they don't feel comfortable doing, and that they should always do the right thing. Don't tell your kids to report their friends' drug use. In most cases, they will get the reputation as a ""rat"", or a ""snitch"", and it's not worth it. Most teenagers won't allow a tattletale into their circle of friends, and your child could become an outcast. Make sure they know not to tell on people.

Children, especially very young children, tend to learn best by observation. If you've worked a desk job for a long time, you may have developed bad habits regarding your own posture. Be conscious of how you're sitting and make sure you keep your back straight at all times., Children need positive reinforcement and tend to learn better through praise than criticism. Do not merely tell your child to ""sit up straight"" when she is slouching. Praise her when she keeps her back straight as well. Tell your child how grown up and tall she looks when she's sitting up straight, for example. This will give her motivation to work on good posture as she'll engage in behaviors that gain her praise from adults., Children might not be willing to follow instructions if they don't see the benefit. Talk to your kids about why good posture can help in the long run.


Abnormal bone growth can result from longterm improper posture. Poor posture can result in disorders like carpal tunnel syndrome and spinal abnormalities, which can cause pain of the joints and limited mobility later on in life.Your breathing improves with better posture, which can increase your energy and ability to concentrate as your brain needs oxygen to work.Good posture can also improve self image. People who slouch less tend to feel better about themselves as standing tall and straight promotes confidence., Children, especially very young children, thrive on the presence of visuals in order to learn. Use pictures and images to teach your child about posture.


You can find child friendly cartoons and handouts online that discuss posture. Children tend to respond to kid friendly visuals over blocks of text or lectures. Printing some images out at home or at your local library can help.You can also have your children engage in fun, creative activities to help you learn about posture. Have your children draw pictures of people using good posture and bad posture.Other creative outlets can help. Consider writing a song about good posture or putting on a short play with your kids., Yoga can help promote posture by strengthening core muscles. Many yoga courses are designed for children. See what's available in your area in regards to children's yoga courses.


As so many children spend a lot of time on computers and smart phones, yoga can be a refreshing break from being slouched over a screen. Yoga promotes posture and flexibility and may increase children's attention spans as they'll learn to spend time away from electronic devices.Make sure any classes you enroll your child in are taught by a certified teacher. This way, you'll know the teacher understands what poses are doable for children and your child will get the most out of the experience., There are a variety of games you can play with your child that promote good posture. Be creative and have fun to help your kids learn.


Play ""My Fair Lady,"" a game in which kids have to walk across a room carrying a book on their head without having it fall off. Kids will have to learn how to stand up properly and position their head and neck in such a way that promotes posture.Encourage climbing. Have your children climb trees or buy climbing nets, climbing domes, or even ladders. Climbing requires a certain amount of core stability and strength that will encourage good posture.Take your kids on bike rides. The way you need to sit on a bike to find balance results in good posture., Consider enrolling your kids in light gymnastic courses. Early gymnastic poses, like animal walks and somersaults, promote core strength and require good posture for correct performance. This is also a great means of exercise and will get your kid involved with the community and give him or her a chance to make friends., Oftentimes, children develop poor posture due to homework and school obligations. If assignments are done electronically especially, children end up slouched over a desk or computer all night. Create a work environment for your child that discourages slouching.


Tables and desks should always be elbow height. Make sure your child is working at a desk that meets these conditions. Do not allow your child to do homework on the couch or in bed.Teach your child proper posture when using a computer. Make sure you tell your child to keep the bottom of her palms lifted above the keyboard rather than resting on it and to keep her shoulders shifted back and her back straight as she types., Television and video games can discourage good posture as children are often lounging or lying down while using them. Try to limit time in front of a screen to around 2 hours a day. Not only will this help with your child's posture, it'll encourage him or her to be social, get exercise, and get outdoors., Certain types of furniture can discourage good posture. Work to alter the furniture you have in your home.


Make sure your child's mattress is firm, as a soft mattress can cause back discomfort that leads to slouching.Avoid overly cushy chairs or sofas, as children might sink into these objects and end up slouching.Encourage kids to sit with their feet flat on the floor. Crossing the legs can twist the spine and result in bad posture."

If all attempts to prevent temper tantrums seem to be failing, you may want to speak with a professional about the situation.",How to Stop Temper Tantrums," It is easier for a child to hear and comprehend 2 or 3 words spoken at a time than an entire sentence. A simple command such as “Stop kicking that” will be comprehended quicker than a sentence stating ‘I want you to stop kicking that before you break it”. If your child understands what you expect from him, he is less likely to throw a temper tantrum out of frustration.


Sometimes a child will respond better if you tell them what you want them to do instead of reprimanding them by telling them not to do something. An example would be to tell a child to ""walk"" instead of saying ""don't run"".;
, Children generally will not respond any better to an angry impatient tone of voice than they will to a soft, calm voice. Harsh tones may distress the child even further and lead to the development of a temper tantrum.

, Often, children are so caught up in themselves that they are not immediately aware of what is being said to them. If this is the case, repetition will work to get your point across and potentially prevent a temper tantrum.

, Conveying to the child that you understand his emotions allows him to feel acknowledged. He will be more likely to respond in a positive manner and listen further when you tell him that you understand what he is upset about before proceeding to tell him why he can not have what he wants. This type of communication can help prevent temper tantrums.

, Generally, a child is more apt to have a meltdown if he is feeling out of sorts in one way or another. Hunger and fatigue can cause children to become cranky. Frustration can send a child into an outburst. Children have not yet learned how to control their emotions and will react by acting out the only way that they know how.

, Often a child will use a tantrum to get the attention they are looking for. They want to be heard and tantrums are a way they can assure to be heard. This is especially true in toddlers just learning to speak. They have a lot to say but are unable to express themselves in a way others can understand. Understanding your child’s emotions and handling them accordingly can help prevent him throwing a temper tantrum out of frustration.

, Children naturally want to emulate the world around them. Unfortunately, the things they often wish to do are beyond their capability. Climbing the stairs or swimming on their own are perfect examples. They struggle for the independence to do these things unaware of the dangers that accompany these tasks. Power struggles can ensue in the form of temper tantrums. Offering your child some independence when appropriate can help prevent tantrums.

, Some children naturally have a calm, relaxed disposition. Others are higher strung, moody and hyperactive. Children that appear more intense are generally more apt to have outbursts. If you know that you have a child who is more likely to have temper tantrums, you can take steps to prevent them.

, If your child becomes agitated when you stop an activity for bath time or dinner, he may be more prone to outbursts. Understanding this can help you develop a more effective way to transition from one activity to another, which can help prevent tantrums.

, If you see that your child is possessive of his belongings or has some difficulty sharing, you can work on his social skills and try to incorporate sharing into his playtime routine. Working on issues that can cause tantrums can help you decrease their occurrence.

,, Sometimes we can’t alter everything in our lives to suit our children’s needs. Knowing a tantrum may ensue if you keep your toddler out way past his bedtime places you in a position where you are taking your chances.

,, Children are easily distracted so use it to your advantage the moment you suspect that a temper tantrum may be on the horizon.

,, Children will often forget what is upsetting them quickly if you can get them to laugh before a temper tantrum begins.

, The only message you send is that physical punishment is an acceptable way to handle anger. You are chastising your child for being unable to control his emotions by being unable to control yours. Chances are all that you will accomplish is more negative behavior and more temper tantrums.

, All the child will learn from this behavior is that throwing a tantrum will get him what they want. The next time he may tantrum even harder just to get his way.

, All this will do is set the stage for future tantrums when the child wants a treat or new toy.

, Place your child in a safe place away from others. If you must restrain him physically, hold him firmly until he has calmed down enough to let him go. Some children will kick and hit and struggle to get free from the restraint. Protect yourself as best as possible and remain determined and calm.

, Sometimes help from a qualified professional may be the last resort.

Appeal to Your Child's Self-Interest.",How to Teach Your Child the Importance of Gratitude," Teach her the ""polite words"" as early as possible. When your child is a toddler, prompt her to say ""please"" whenever she asks for something and ""thank you"" whenever she's given something, no matter how small. From a young age she'll understand that we must show respect and appreciation to those who do things for us. If she's too young to say the words, say them for her.;
, When he's old enough to draw, have him ""write"" thank you notes for gifts he receives. At first, you'll be writing the note, but as your child gets older he'll be able to do the writing himself. Make it more appealing by getting child-oriented note cards, personalized return-address stickers, and fun stamps. If your child is unwilling, insist! Put the gift off-limits until the note is written or come up with another consequence. Although he may not appreciate it now, writing thank you notes is a crucial life skill.

, Example is the best teacher, so let your children see you show gratitude to others, especially family members. Say ""thank you"" when your child passes you the milk or does a chore. Tell your spouse ""I really appreciated you folding the laundry for me."" Make a fuss when you open gifts. Let your child see your joy in the little present he made just for you. And make sure your child sees you writing thank you notes too!

, Have you ever felt happy just to get out of bed and see the sun shining outside? Don't keep it to yourself! ""I love sunny mornings! It's great to be alive!"" A sense of happy appreciation for the beautiful world around us can be infectious.

Aren't we lucky to have such a wonderful neighbor?""

, Involve your child in charitable giving or volunteer work. Nothing inspires gratitude like realizing how difficult life can be for other people. If you give to a charity, explain to your child why you do and ask her to help. ""I'm buying a toy for a child who won't get many Christmas presents. Would you like to use your allowance to buy one too?"" Get involved in volunteer work as a family. You can participate in a clean-up day along the local creek, volunteer at an animal shelter, or wrap Christmas presents for a toy drive. Your child will see that many people do extra work to make our world a better place.

, Despite your best efforts, by the time your child reaches the adolescent years, he may have moments of believing he is the most unfortunate person on the planet: everyone else has a better cell phone, more lenient parents, more expensive clothes, and a brand new car. Try having Gratitude Time at the dinner table. Before eating, each family member takes a turn describing what he or she is grateful for that day. It can be something significant: ""I'm glad Grandpa is out of the hospital,"" or trivial: ""I'm grateful we're having ice cream for dessert."" Gratitude Time may be awkward at first. Be patient with statements like ""I'm grateful Billy isn't wearing his hideous green sweatshirt"" and gently prompt for a sincere comment. Encourage your child's participation by expressing your gratitude for him.

, An older child who didn't pick up the gratitude habit early on might believe that expressing gratitude is a ridiculous waste of time, or that it's phony. ""I hated that sweater Grandma sent me! Why should I say thank you?"" Explain to her that her future depends on the ability to say ""thank you."" Who wants to do business with a company who doesn't appreciate its clients? Who wants to continue helping an ungrateful colleague? Who wants to invite an ungrateful house guest to their condo in Maui? If they start tuning you out, you might need to provide the reality check yourself. Tell Grandma to stop sending gifts. Don't wash clothes, give rides, or do other chores for a child who does not say ""thank you"" consistently. She may resent this ""tough love"" approach, but eventually she'll thank you!

Expose your baby to music as early as possible.,
Help your baby to associate music with pleasant emotions.,
Encourage your baby to make noise.,
Make music fun.,
Expose your baby to a wide variety of music.,
Play musical games.,
Expose your child to different areas of music.,
Introduce your child to your favorite band.,
Incorporate dancing into your music education.,
Get your kids involved in music groups or classes.,
Encourage your child to practice at home.",How to Raise Kids Who Love Music," Even from the womb, babies can recognize music, and studies have shown that it has a large impact on a fetus’s mood. Start your child off on the right foot by singing or playing music for them before they are born.


Forget the myth about putting headphones on a pregnant belly—amniotic fluid is a good conductor of sound and can spread music to the baby just by playing a stereo at a normal level.
After children are born, expose them to a variety of music by singing, playing, and dancing to music. The earlier babies and young children hear music, the larger role it will play in their lives.;
, Take advantage of the impact music can have on a young baby’s mood. Lullabies are great for calming down a fussy baby, and upbeat songs can make a cranky baby happier.


Repeating the same songs to your baby over and over will help them associate those songs with the safety of their parents and will make them feel safe and happy.

, Give your baby toys that make noise, such as rattles and shakers. Using those toys as baby’s first instrument will help to instill a love of music in them early on.


Alternatively, give your child a wooden spoon and selection of pans and lids and let him play. Give him pans of different thicknesses and different materials to produce different sounds.
Also encourage your baby to make cooing noises or to ""sing"". You can do this by repeating an easy sound over and over again while encouraging your baby to copy you.

, Just like anything else, kids are much more likely to want to study and develop their talents in an area if they find it fun and entertaining. When children are small, introduce musical games.


An easy way to do this is to play a song and tap on their legs or arms to the beat. This helps babies recognize the cadence of the music. You can also take a baby’s hand and wave it in the air like they are conducting music during a song.
Another simple way to make music fun is to make a favorite stuffed animal sing or dance to the music. Point out music and sounds all around you, like the background music at the store or the beat the water makes as it drips from the faucet.

, Although kids are interested in baby and toddler music for a reason, exposing children to a large variety of music, from Pearl Jam to Beethoven, can have a large impact on their music appreciation.


A variety of music not only allows children to find the perfect match to their personality, it shows them the variety of styles and musical instruments available.
A child may not be interested in the piano and may have a large interest in the drums, but he wouldn’t know that if parents hadn’t exposed him to drum-heavy songs.

, As children get older, play games like “name that tune” or “finish the song”. These are simple games where a parent hums part of a song and the child guesses what song it is. In “finish the song”, you start singing a song and then pass it to your child to finish the second half of the song.


Action songs and dancing are also fun ways to get children involved as they experience music throughout their entire body. Simple action songs include “The Itsy Bitsy Spider”, “Wheels on the Bus”, and “London Bridge is Falling Down”.
These songs are particularly effective for wiggly children because it gives them a positive association with music.

, Developing a true love of music comes from more than just listening to music. To truly develop a musical appreciation in your children, show them music in a variety of forms, such as books about music or instruments, musical movies, concerts, and musical games.


Visit the local library to find suggestions of age-appropriate musicals and books that are available for checkout. Local newspapers should also have listings of community events, such as concerts and plays.
Together, these tools can be used to create a strong sensory environment that will make music a major part of their childhood.

, Introducing children to your favorite band or musical genre will also help them get interested in music, as they will feel your excitement and passion.


Set a good example by telling your child why you like a particular band or by taking a moment to explain the lyrics of your favorite song. This will help them to appreciate music on a deeper level.
It isn't until a child is around eight years old that they pick a favorite genre to listen to constantly, so expose them to plenty of different genres early on in order to expand their horizons.

, Learning combined with movement is more likely to be retained, so songs and music paired with dancing can create fun memories that will stick with your child.


It doesn't matter if you're not a great dancer yourself, the point is just to let loose and have fun and create happy musical memories with your child.
Give your children the freedom to be creative with music and movement and let them explore the many styles of music, from hip-hop to salsa, swing to rock 'n' roll.

, Once your child is old enough to truly appreciate music, get them involved in musical groups.


Younger children can start in age-appropriate music, such as Kindermusik or Gymboree, and dance classes, and older children can begin to learn an instrument on their own or in lessons.
Allowing your child to have a say in what area of music they would like to pursue will help them feel engaged and will increase the quality of their love and learning.
From private lessons to youth bands and dance classes, any class or organized group that involves music will be beneficial for your child.

, Encourage your children to give performances at home with what they learn in their music classes. Reward them for practicing with kind words or prizes and make the home a positive environment and extension of what they learn in class.


Listen carefully to your child when he is playing his instrument or singing. In this way, his self-esteem will be stronger and he will try harder. Find ways to improve his playing, but do not be overly critical or look for perfection.
Let the child compose his own music. If your child plays an instrument, encourage him to compose his own music, then praise his efforts.

  Start encouraging the child to go barefoot at home as often as possible.,
   Let your kids play in the front and backyard without shoes.,
Start taking them on excursions to barefoot friendly areas, such as the park and the beach.,
Venture into other areas after four months.,
Enjoy going barefoot!",How to Transition Your Kids to a Barefoot Lifestyle," Make the house a shoe-free zone; removing shoes and socks at the door should become standard routine. This has the added benefit of keeping floors clean.;
, After about two weeks, they should be able to play around the neighborhood and visit their friends' houses barefoot without issue.


Most children who have worn shoes will initially run striking the ground heel first due to being accustomed to wearing rigid, over-padded shoes which have a downward tilt towards the toe. A couple weeks of barefoot running will correct their gait and encourage them them to land properly on the forefoot and balls of the feet.
For cleanliness, keeping a bucket of soap water and towel by the door is sufficient to keep your interior pristine. You will find bare feet are supremely dirt-resistant, and track in far less outdoor debris than shoes!

, After two months, you can try taking them on family hikes. Many trails exist in Germany and Switzerland for the express purpose of hiking barefoot. Taking along pair of thongs in the backpack for them in case you run across rough terrain would be a prudent measure., At this stage your child's feet will be tough enough for optimal performance on most surfaces, and you can start taking them on excursions to the store and library. Contrary to many public conceptions, there are no legal health standards against letting customers go barefoot.

Regardless of the ""No shirt, No shoes, No service"" signs, it has been observed that most people do not have a negative response to barefoot children. If it becomes an issue, carrying an extra pair of sandals wouldn't be amiss.

, If you homeschool and/or live in a warm climate, it's safe to donate the remaining pairs of shoes and socks at the end of six months.


If you deal with bad weather or need to send them to school with shoes, you'll want to hold onto some!
Some climates are in-conducive for allowing children go barefoot all year. In these instances, you may want to look into getting your child minimalist footwear, or loose fitting moccasins with flexible soles and lots of interior padding. Socks should be thick and warm, being neither too loose or too tight. Avoid synthetic material, and shoes with a rigid sole structure.
A good indicator of whether it's too cold for bare feet is the need for mittens. If your kids don't need gloves, chances are they won't need shoes! In areas averaging 60 degrees in winter, it's perfectly safe for children to go barefoot indefinitely.

Assuming the seat isn't so dirty as to need immediate attention, wait until you feel comfortable doing without the seat for at least several hours. An ideal time might be after your infant has been put to bed for the night.


If, however, you're dealing with vomit, a blown-out diaper, or some other big mess, immediate ""triage"" cleaning is the best way to salvage the seat.;
, Using baby wipes or damp rags or paper towels, wipe and scoop away any loose, sloppy, sticky, chunky, etc. debris. (We'll leave the details of the types of messes you can face to the imagination.)Clearing away this gunk will make the remaining cleaning portion easier to manage.

, Untie all the straps, and uninstall the seat. Doing so will allow you to wash the seat thoroughly without climbing into the car and getting everything wet. You’ll also be able to easily reach all the parts of the infant seat.Take note of the de-installation to help you with the re-installation. Take pictures if necessary.

, Brush crumbs and debris off the car seat. Give the seat a shake to remove any hidden crumbs or other debris that has accumulated.If you have a vacuum cleaner with a small attachment, use it to remove any additional debris that may be stuck in partition walls and corners.

, Most infant car seats have removable fabric covers. If you have your manual handy, consult it. If not, you can generally start from the top, unfastening clips, snaps, and buttons until you reach the bottom of the seat.


Once you have taken the cover off, you should also take off the straps. Try to memorize their location (or take a picture) so that you know how to put them back into place (this is especially important if you do not have your manual).
For safety reasons, harness straps (and buckles, to a lesser extent) require special and gentle cleaning. See the relevant section of this article for more information, and always consult your owner's manual., Once the cloth cover is removed, you can easily rub a mild detergent into any visible spots or stains. Rub in a circular motion to get these places as clean as possible.If your car seat does not have a removable cover, do your best to deal with spots using a sponge and some soap. Scrub until the spots fade.

, Check your manual or the cover label for specific instructions, but in general, it’s best to wash on the gentle cycle. Use a mild detergent; remember that your child’s skin will be in contact with it. Make sure the cover gets completely rinsed.Generally speaking, cotton covers can be washed at up to 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit). If your cover is made of synthetic fibers or dark colors, though, stick to washing at up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).
If you cannot remove the cover to run it through the washing machine, you’ll have to wash the whole thing by hand. Use a sponge and a mild detergent to clean the entire cover.

, Once you’ve washed the cover, continue to wash the plastic and metal parts of the seat. Use a damp cloth or sponge along with a mild detergent and water. Rub away all the dirt and grime, then rinse well under running water. Spray with disinfectant if desired.This is the part of the cleaning when you can vent some of your frustrations. As long as you're not using an abrasive cleaner or scrubber (like steel wool), feel free to really get in there and scrub away. Use a garden hose to spray everything down if desired.
As a general rule, it's best to tilt the seat in various directions after rinsing. This prevents water from accumulating in any of the parts.

, Machine laundering or harsh cleaners or scrubbing can degrade the strength of the straps, causing a safety hazard.Follow the manual's instructions carefully, and see the relevant section of this article for tips on cleaning straps and buckles.

, Most if not all car seat manufacturers recommend that harness straps not be placed in a washing machine or hand cleaned with harsh detergents. Surface cleaning with a soft cloth, lukewarm water, and a gentle soap if necessary are the typical recommendations.While such delicate care may seem odd for these strong, protective straps that are meant to stand up to car accidents, the concern lies in the fact that vigorous washing and/or harsh chemicals can weaken the tensile strength of the strap material. This can occur even when the strap still looks strong. But such weakening would make a failure much more possible in an accident.

, Focus on wiping away surface stains, and forget about attempting deep cleaning. Use only a mild soap, like hand soap, if necessary.


If the straps are so disgustingly soiled that you can't stand to keep using them, or look worn or damaged in any way, immediately replace them. Contact the seat manufacturer to see if replacement straps are available. This should be able to save you from having to buy a whole new seat., Whether plastic or metal, the buckles should be able to hold up to more vigorous cleaning than the straps. However, they are still essential components that should face minimal wear and tear to ensure they work when it really counts.


Simply dangle the buckle on the strap and dip it into a bucket of lukewarm water, then slosh it around a bit to loosen any gunk inside the mechanism. Clean the surface with a soft cloth and water (and mild soap if needed)., Fresh air, sunshine, and time are the best ways to remove odors from harness straps. If that's not possible, at least let them air dry thoroughly before re-installation.Never place harness straps in the dryer, or use a hot blow dryer on them. Extreme heat could also possibly damage the tensile strength.
Make sure the inside of the buckle is thoroughly dry as well, to prevent any rusting or corrosion.

, If your cover is removable, either run it through the dryer, if the label permits it, or hang it to air dry.Lay the plastic surface out to air dry. Once you have rinsed the plastic and metal parts of the seat, you can simply leave it sitting someplace to air dry. Wiping it with a dry cloth will expedite the process, but in general, it’s best to allow several hours or a day for it to dry completely.
As noted, always only air dry harness straps and buckles.

, If you cannot remove the cover, you can leave the entire seat, cover and all, in a sunny place to dry. If you don't have sunshine, it will just take more time.You can use odor-eliminating sprays on the base and fabric cover if desired. Remember, however, that your child's skin will be in close contact with the cover, so be mindful of the materials in your chosen spray.
Don't spray down the harness straps. Just rely on air as the odor eliminator.

, Once it has dried completely, reattach the fabric cover to the seat base. Refer to the instruction manual if necessary.You basically need to reverse the process you used to remove the cover, so if you took mental or physical notes, or a picture, video, or sketch, you should be in good shape.

, Pull the strap back through the holes correctly, in the right order, to properly install the seat and make sure that it is safe for your child. Again, refer to the instruction manual if necessary.Make sure that the straps do not twist when you thread them through the seat. Twists in the straps can cause them to wear out faster, and they may rub uncomfortably against your baby's skin. Even worse, if the straps are severely twisted, they may not hold your infant securely in a collision.
If you have any concern about your re-installation, take your seat to a fire department or other site where free car seat safety checks are done. Someone there will be happy to ensure a safe installation.
Likewise, if you have any concerns about the integrity of any components, especially straps and buckles, replace them or the entire seat. Your child's safety is always a worthwhile investment.

Be honest about a parent who has never been involved.,

Answer questions and tell the truth.,
Avoid hostility.,
Offer your child access to counseling.",How to Tell a Child About an Absent Parent," If your child has never met the other parent or if the parent has been absent for a long time, be prepared for lots of questions. Your child will likely want to know who the parent is, where he is, and why he is not involved. Questions about an absent parent will most likely begin when your child starts school and begins learning more about classmates' families.Answer basic questions about who the absent parent is, and consider sharing a photograph if you have one.
Tell your child that all families are different and remind her about all the people who love her. Try using examples from books and movies, or from real life, to teach her about all different kinds of families
Be upfront about the likelihood of your child ever meeting the other parent. If the other parent has no interest in being involved or you are not able to contact them, don't get your child's hopes up by promising an eventual meeting. Make sure you emphasize that this is not the child's fault in any way.
Keep your personal feelings to yourself as much as possible. You can share more details about the circumstances of the other parent's absence as your child gets older, but try not to say negative things about the other parent.;
, If the absence is predictable and regular, tell your child when the other parent is coming back by showing them a calendar and talking it over with them. Discuss regular travel as a family, so that it becomes a normal expectation within the family and all members can be prepared for the parent to miss occasional special events, such as sports games and celebratory occasions, and can prepare well in advance.


If business trips regularly occur with little warning, be sure to explain that as well so there will be no surprises.
Help your child keep in touch with the absent parent by arranging phone calls or video chats. You can also encourage the parent who is away to bring the child back souvenirs from their travels.

, Be sure to give your child the opportunity to express her feelings and concerns, and offer her plenty of support.Be as honest as the age of your child permits. A toddler only needs to know that daddy will be back by Christmas, while a teenager will need to know the truth about the length of the deployment and where the parent will be.
Include your child in your communications with the absent parent, including letters and phone calls, as much as possible. If regular contact is not possible, explain to the child that her mom or dad really wants to talk to her, but can't because of work.

, No matter what the reason for the absence, be sure to make it clear that it is not the child's fault. Younger children in particular may feel as though they are responsible for the absence if you don't assure them otherwise.


If the absence is unpredictable (if, for example, a parent is in the hospital after an accident), explain what has happened, give a generous estimate of when mommy or daddy will be back, and keep your child updated on progress and changes to the dates.
Try to keep your child from worrying. Answer her questions and make sure she understands the situation, but don't provide her with details that might confuse her more.

, Be sure to tell your child that the absence has nothing to do with her, and answer any questions she has honestly.


If a parent has separated from the marriage and family, you have to be honest without letting any anger get in the way. For example, you could say, ""Daddy loves you but was unhappy with his life, so he's gone to live in Vegas. We'll do our best to keep in touch but it will be hard sometimes. I can give you his address if you'd like to write to see how he is doing.""
If a parent passes away, be open and honest, encourage the child to express her emotions, and help her cope with her grief as best you can., While you should not try to replace the missing parent, you can try to fill some of his or her roles. If the absence is permanent, you may consider becoming more involved in some of the special activities the absent parent used to be involved with. If the absence is temporary, keep your own style and be thoughtful about telling your child that some activities are reserved for the other parent, in order to keep those things special and to ensure retention of the sacredness of their bonding.

, If the absence is short-term, encourage the absent parent to stay in touch with the child via phone, video chat, letters, and email as much as possible. Remind your child that her other parent is still very much a part of her life, even though he is far away. If the absence is long-term, try to encourage some level of contact if possible, even if it is only an occasional phone call or letter.


Let older children decide for themselves how often they wish to communicate with a long-absent parent.
Try to communicate to the absent parent that contact is very important and that it would mean a lot to your child, even if they don't have a close relationship.

, Whether your child's other parent has passed away or is permanently absent for another reason, share positive memories of the absent parent. Your child will likely have questions about what her other parent was like, especially if the absence began when she was very young. Answer these to the best of your ability, but always keep things positive.

, This doesn't mean that a child needs to know every detail about the other parent's life, but don't tell white lies to make her feel better about the situation. If the parent is dealing with a problem such as drug addiction and you feel the child is too young to hear about these specifics, just tell her something general, such as, ""Mommy is dealing with some personal problems, but that doesn't mean she's not thinking about you."" , No matter how you may feel about the absent parent, try not to express negative emotions to your child. It is up to her to decide how she wants to feel about her absent parent. Trying to turn your child against her other parent may lead to behavioral problems., Every child is different, and some may benefit from talking to a professional about how they feel about the absence of their parent. You should definitely encourage counseling if you notice any changes in your child's behavior that you suspect may be related the the absence.


Support groups are also a great resources for many children, especially those dealing with the death of a parent, or those whose parent is incarcerated. Talking to other children who have had similar experiences can help them understand and deal with their own feelings.

Help your kids practice cataloging things that they feel grateful for.,
Appreciate the broad things and the little things.,
Practice gratitude regularly.,
Smell the roses.,
Have your kids tell you three good things when you put them to bed each night.,
Write gratitude letters.,
Don't label your children.,
Model gratitude and appreciation.",How to Teach Gratitude to Kids," For example:


Keep a gratitude journal
Keep a family gratitude list and post it on the refrigerator
Go around the dinner table at dinnertime and have everyone say something that they're grateful for;
, Gratitude can be as simple as being grateful for being born, or being grateful for specific things such as a new puppy, doll, or toy. All of this counts in practicing gratitude with your kids.

, You can do it daily but research shows that even just doing it once a week will have a considerable effect and all kinds of benefits.

, Savor positive experiences; doing so tends to amplify the pleasant emotions that you might be feeling.

, This should relate to things that happened to them that day or that they did during the day. This gives them a lens through gratitude glasses. Practicing this routine at the end of the day will help teach your children to slow down, savor the moment, and notice things that they feel appreciative about and should be thankful for.

, This is a souped-up version of the thank you note. Teach your kids to think about writing a letter to somebody like a teacher, or a family member who has done something for them that has gone with little gratitude. This teaches them that it is not just about when somebody gives you something material but when somebody really does something for you. Help your child write the letter - they can dictate for you if they're younger. Talk about what they feel grateful for and then take them to deliver it in person and read it out loud.

, When we say that our children are really talented at something, we actually set this talent in stone and suggest that it doesn't change. It creates a ""fixed mindset""; it means that we believe that talents and anything that a kid is good at are inborn. This label is one that they haven't necessarily earned and they got it just by being born. Instead, change that fixed mindset to be more of a growth mindset, then we start to value the role of effort a little bit more.


A fixed mindset example would be: ""You did great on that test. You must be really smart.""
The growth mindset would be: ""You did really great on that test. You must have tried really hard."" This mindset gives kids something to really hang their hat on.

, Say thank you or ""I appreciate..."" to family members, friends, and others."

Declare recess.,
When you think the children are ready, have a test meal.,
Proudly observe as you watch your children dining as politely as you would.",How to Teach Restaurant Dining Manners to Kids," Children under six will be a handful and you should think seriously if you want to teach a child under four as they won't pick up on things so easily and will forget more easily. Although, with patience, you can teach dining manners even to a toddler (at a more basic level, of course).;
, You should be modeling this behavior as much as possible; children absorb the attitudes and behaviors of the adults around them. Before starting the actual teaching, sit down with the child/ren and tell them you are about to teach them proper dining manners for the next meal. Approach the matter positively (this is easier towards young girls as they see pretty women - i.e. princesses - eating with fine china and tall glasses) and tell them what is supposed to be the outcome. Maybe you can start by taking them on an outing with you and your spouse or perhaps this is directed towards a particular event. Tell them. If they get excited about the prospect of going, they'll most likely pay attention and behave.

, Read a manners book from the local library if necessary. You could also borrow it if the children are old enough to read or if there are plenty of pictures and show them.

, If it is usually a child's job to set the table, teach them all how is it done at fancy events. This is so they can expect where to find their utensils and glasses as there may be a lot of things on the table before they start getting cleared as the meal goes by. See the image and the respective subtitle as a general guide. Tell them where each fork and knife goes and what they should be used for. If they are visual, take a large piece of paper and have them trace around the plates, glasses and utensils, as an aid to remembering.

, This could be a great time to teach them the appearance and positions of the utensils once again so that they can recognise them and tell them apart (for example the fish knife vs. the salad knife). Let them look at things and absorb the overall look of a set table before the meal. Explain which thing is used for what. This could be a good time to brush up on speech manners as well so that your youngsters can make a nice conversation.

, You can even serve play food if you want. Use this meal as a first practical approach and quiz the children. When they do wrong, give a feedback sandwich and when they do right be sure to greet, and reward accordingly to their age. As the meal progresses revise the different contents, that is, when the ""fish"" is served, have all the children pick up their fish utensils and pretend to eat the fish. This is a good time to revise if their way of picking up, holding the utensil and actually having the food is polite and polished. Adjust your teachings accordingly.

, The younger they are, the more likely it will have tired them to sit still and be nice and polite for a while. Use this time to assess whether you have reached your goals. If your children have met your goals for the desired level of politeness you can call the subject closed and proceed with some confidence. If not, you can try again some other day until they do.

, Depending on how confident you are, this is best done at home during dinner. Before the meal, tell each child that they shouldn't make fun of others' wrong answers but should verbally encourage the others when they get answers right. Sit down for dinner with the whole family and when the food is served, and the children reach for their things, observe: they will most likely be doing it right. If they aren't, kindly correct them, preferably pointing out something they did good at the same time.

, You did a good job.

Normalize personal space and setting boundaries.,
Encourage her to be imaginative and open when thinking about her future.,
Encourage her to be comfortable with her body.,
Offer compliments about all of her.,
Encourage her to be kind and mindful towards other people.,
Teach her to value all kinds of people.Explain that everyone is different, and that's why the world is so interesting.",How to Teach Feminism to Young Girls1," One of the easiest ways to teach her that there is no ""wrong"" way to be a girl is to let her choose her path for herself. Let her embrace her own style, whether she's a girly girl, a nerd, a tomboy, or something else entirely.


Allow her to wander between blue and pink aisles when choosing toys and clothes. Explain that the ""boy"" and ""girl"" signs are suggestions, not rules.
In some - but not all - cases, a child who rejects femininity may be transgender.;
, Support her agency and independence by letting her make age-appropriate choices. See how you can work them into your routine. When possible, let her choose things like...


What she'll wear
Whether she'll play outside or inside
What she'll eat (you can offer a few choices)

, A feminist girl is an independent thinker, and it's important for her to be learning and growing. Teach her things, from why there are clouds in the sky to why she has to sit in a booster seat in the car.


Encourage her to explore and ask questions.
Look for budding interests, and give her the opportunity to explore them further.

, Stop the instinct to swoop in to the rescue if you see her having a hard time with something. Instead, let her keep trying. If you think she may need help, say ""You can ask me if you need help."" This lets her self-evaluate and decide whether she wants help from you.

, Encourage consent with regards to hugs, kisses, tickles, and other types of touch. If the girl says she doesn't want to be touched a certain way, respect that, and make sure other people do too.


Reward assertiveness with praise. Say ""nice job speaking your mind"" or ""thanks for letting me know that you don't like wet kisses. Do you like kisses on your hair?""
Encourage her to ask for things she wants.You can be a role model by setting your own boundaries. For example, you can say ""I'm tired right now and I don't want a hug"" if you don't want to be hugged.

, She can be a scientist, a teacher, a mathematician, a full-time mom... Let her choose whatever she thinks is most interesting.Show her stories about women in the fields that she finds interesting (whether it's a hobby or something she's considering for a job). Tell a girl who loves to paint about Frieda Kahlo, and teach a girl who loves computers about Grace Hopper. This can help her imagine herself doing similar things.

, Teach her the correct names for her body parts, to take any shame out of the equation.Avoid criticizing her body, such as calling her too fat, and don't criticize your own in front of her.


If she starts yelling about her butt in public, you can explain to her ""We usually talk about these in private, because these are private parts, so other people don't need to know.""
Keep details age-appropriate.For example, your seven-year-old doesn't need to know how painful and gory childbirth can be.

, It's okay to call her cute or pretty every once in a while—but don't make this the only nice thing you say about her. Compliment her mind, her kindness, her assertiveness, and other positive traits unrelated to how she looks. This helps her learn that she's a valuable person for who she is, not what she looks like.(Being cute is just a bonus.)

, Feminism's goals include fairness and supporting each other, so it's important for her to know how to be kind and be a good listener.Talk about considering how other people feel and treating them well.


Teach her that the right kind of success is never achieved by hurting other people.

,


Don't judge people for having different lifestyles. Instead, acknowledge that different things work for different people.
Be honest and open about differences in race, disability, religion, age, culture, and other things. Be matter-of-fact and positive, such as ""Yes, Jamal has dark skin. Different people have different skin colors, and all kinds are beautiful"" and ""Audrey flaps her hands when she's happy, because she's autistic. And you giggle and snort when you're happy.""

Encourage critical thinking.A feminist child is willing to ask questions, think about why things are the way they are, and imagine better ways for the world to be.,
Explain about stereotypes, and that they don't have to be followed.,
Talk about the media.,
Encourage her to do what she can to help others, and not obsess over her mistakes or the things she can't fix.",How to Teach Feminism to Young Girls2,"


Don't just tell the child if something is wrong. Ask questions about it, and help them think it out.

, Point out some examples, like ""boys don't cry,"" ""girls need to look pretty,"" and ""boys are good at STEM and girls are good at language and art."" Talk about how they can be limiting, and encourage her to make her own choices.Try not to pressure her to break stereotypes, because this may make her feel limited. Allow her to explore art, fashion, beauty, and whatever else interests her. Explain that there's nothing wrong with being stereotypical, only with expecting people to be.

, Help her notice when women are being objectified, or when beauty is over-emphasized. Remind her that most people don't look like the women on TV, and the women themselves probably don't even look like that in their everyday life., A feminist wants to stand up for people who are being harmed, encourage kindness, and help others in need. Teach her that she should do the best she is able to do when she can.


Be a role model. Acknowledge when you mess up, and be ready to learn and apologize.Teach her not to beat herself up if she fails. Say ""You did the best you were able to do at the time.""

Expect to have several conversations.,
Use an open, educational tone of voice.,
Keep it age-appropriate.,
Consider checking out educational books from the library.,
Discuss the letters in the LGBTQIA+ acronym.,
Explain you can't tell for sure if someone is gay by how they act or look and that a person's masculinity or femininity doesn't relate to their sexual orientation.,
Explain that sexual curiosity is natural.,
Be clear about sexual safety and peer pressure.,
Encourage your kids to take their time.,
Encourage your child to respect others.,
Remind them that an individual is an expert on their own orientation.,
Be honest about bullying and discrimination.,
Discuss the importance of privacy.",How to Talk to Your Kids About Homosexuality," LGBT issues are complex, so you can't cram all of them into one 20-minute conversation. You will probably have quite a few conversations over their childhood, and that's normal and okay.


If your child seems disinterested, stop talking. They won't learn much if they've tuned you out. You can always continue the conversation another day.
If your child is eager and full of questions, this is a sign that they need more information. Try checking out library books, so they can learn more, and your voice can have a break.;
, Your attitude will help shape your children's attitudes, and you can help them feel like it isn't anything to get worked up over. Use the same tone you would to describe why you go grocery shopping every weekend, or why the sky turns red when the sun sets.

, Young children might want to know why those two guys are holding hands, but wouldn't be able to handle complex issues like workplace discrimination or how sexual attraction works.

, Whether it's a story about a girl who wanted to hold hands with another girl, or a drama about a teen with two dads, LGBT+ inclusive media can help normalize the idea of different orientations.


Look for age-appropriate reading or viewing material. In general, if your child has seen straight couples do something in a story (e.g. prince and princess kissing), then they are ready to see LGB couples do it too.

, It's helpful for children to know the various possibilities, so that they have words for what they see and/or experience. Your child should know about gay and lesbian people, and also bi/pansexual people, aromantic people, asexual people, transgender people, et cetera. Even if they turn out to be straight and cisgender, this will help them be supportive to the people they meet.


If they turn out to be LGBT+, having the vocabulary and a safe home environment can lower their risk of mental health issues and give them a much happier life.

, Some men are ""effeminate"" and some women are ""masculine"" but are not gay. Some men are ""masculine"" and some women are ""effeminate"" but are gay. Every person is different, and orientation won't define anything other than the person's attraction.


Wearing speedos, wearing brief underwear, having a lisp, having a particular haircut, speaking in a high or low voice, hugging someone of the same gender, seeing someone of the same gender naked, taking a nude shower in a locker room, listening to show tunes, et cetera, are all examples of things that do not make someone gay.
Explain that some gay people act in ""stereotypical"" ways, and some do not. Neither is better than the other; people should be themselves.

, Many children and teens feel curiosity about others' bodies, including people of the same gender and different genders. Healthy experimentation does not dictate their orientation.


One kiss, touch, dream, or sexual experience does not define orientation. It could have been a passing curiosity, a sign about their true orientation, or anything in between. Experimentation is normal.
Mention that a few people experience very little or no sexual curiosity. This way, if your child turns out to be aromantic and/or asexual, they will feel like it's okay and they aren't ""broken"" or ""bad.""

, Experimentation is healthy, but only when done in a safe, consensual manner. Explain that some people just aren't ready to do certain things yet, and that this is normal and okay. They shouldn't let pressure make them try things they don't feel ready to do, nor should they push someone who doesn't feel ready.


Explain the basics of consent. The other person should be awake and alert (no alcohol!), willing, and an active partner. If they look disinterested, seem unsure, or act aloof, then let it be.
Make sure that your teens know how to use protection. If you don't want to have an awkward conversation, direct them to websites like Scarleteen, so they can teach themselves.

, They might know their identity from the start—or it may be a long and difficult journey. Explain that there is no ""right"" way to know who they are, and they can take as long as they need to take. Encourage them not to pressure themselves, and to be okay with not knowing if they're confused.


If your child is adamant about their orientation, assume that it isn't a phase. Believing them is important. If they do turn out to be wrong, they'll need to figure it out for themselves, and they'll know that you have their back.

, Make it clear that it's okay to be different, and that people of all personalities and backgrounds should be treated with compassion and acceptance.


If someone doesn't want to talk about their orientation, that's okay. Respect their privacy.
If someone tells you what their orientation is, believe them.

, You can help your children tackle the questions of their own identity, but in the end, the words they use to define themselves are their choice (and theirs alone). Similarly, other people are the experts on their personal orientations, and your children should respect them and take their word for it.


It can be hurtful to try to guess someone else's orientation, or to not believe them when they tell you.

, Your child has probably witnessed some of it, even if they don't fully understand. Make it clear that bullying happens, it's wrong, and it's the fault of the bully for choosing to be mean (not of the victim).


Teach your child the phrase ""I'm okay, they're mean."" This can protect their self esteem when they are bullied, whether it's related to perceived orientation or something else.
Teach some basic intervention strategies, like asking the victim to hang out with them, or making a distraction like ""accidentally"" dropping all their books.

, Due to discrimination, personal uncertainty, and different personalities, some people do not like to be open about their orientations. This is their choice. Explain to your child that each person will decide how open they want to be, and your child should follow the other person's lead.


After someone comes out, your child should ask whether this is private information. This way, there won't be misunderstandings about whether it is okay to tell. For example, maybe they're okay with their friend group knowing, but not their teachers.
When in doubt, a good rule is not to tell. Make it clear that your children shouldn't reveal any of their friends' orientations unless their friends specifically told them it was okay.

Let your children know that people are not supposed to look alike and those differences should be appreciated.,
Acknowledge differences.,
Do not associate being the same with being normal.",How to Talk to Your Children About Race1,";
, Your children are highly trained in spotting differences. If you continue talking about ""looking past"" someone's race or being ""colorblind"", then you are saying that something is wrong with that person's race for you to ignore it.

, Talking about how we are all the same, is saying that being different is a bad thing and that difference interrupts harmony and balance. Don't give your children the message that people must have similarities or have to be the same as you in order for them to show kindness and respect.

"
"
Do not insult their intelligence by thinking that race is an adult issue.,
Take into consideration who (which race) is in power and who is most desired to be in power.,
Don't act like race doesn't matter.,
Ask what shows they watch and if they notice that one race is more represented in most of the shows they watch.

",How to Talk to Your Children About Race2," Racism is a system of advantage based on race. You have to remember your children are raised in a system that favors one person's race over another. For example, people of Middle Eastern descent are usually on many forms of the media for ""terrorist"" issues, while people of European descent are usually talking about their accomplishments, goals and are mainly politicians.

, Ask your children about who they think should be in power or who they like to see in power, and why?

, These mannerisms help racism continue and go unnoticed.

"
If your child shows disdain for people of other races, do not see yourself as a failure, but see it as a time when your child needs improvement.,
Immediately correct your child about this and let them know that prejudice is not right.

,
Show them pictures of people from the race that they show disdain for accomplishing things that made society better.",How to Talk to Your Children About Race3," It is times like this that your child needs guidance and your parenting.

,, It helps scatter any hatred or generalization of that your child might have of that race. For example, if your child has prejudice against black people and thinks that they are not intelligent, show your child images of black people who are scientists, scholars, and talk about their academic achievements.

Take her shopping for a bra when she's ready.",How to Talk to Your Daughter About Puberty," In generations past, parents often sat down with their children and had a big talk about ""the birds and the bees"" around the age of puberty. This strategy often overwhelms children with too much information at once, or backfires if children have already heard about the topics from school or the media.


Instead of having one big talk, think about this as an ongoing conversation that lasts her entire childhood, providing your daughter with information about her body and sexuality.
If you haven't started having this ongoing conversation with your daughter, start now. As long as she is living with you, she can benefit from your wisdom and knowledge on these subjects.;
, While it is not a good idea to wait and spring too much information on her at one time, you also want to be sure that you always provide only age-appropriate information. Telling a young child too much information about reproduction, for example, could frighten her or give her a distorted view of sex. Keep things age appropriate by emphasizing the following topics during the right ages:


Before age 8, focus on body positivity. Use the correct terms for body parts, like ""vulva"" and ""vagina,"" and teach her that girls and boys have different parts. Teach her about the difference between ""good touch"" like hugs and pats on the back, and ""bad touch"" in areas of the body covered by swimsuits. Teach her what to do if she is uncomfortable.
By age 8, talk to your daughter about menstruation. While it is uncommon, your daughter could experience an early onset of menstruation any time after age 8 (although it is more common closer to 12). It can be a scary experience for a young girl to start her period without any knowledge that it is normal or preparation on what to do.From about age 8-10, talk to her about relationships, peer pressure, and the changes in her and her friends' bodies she can expect during puberty. Provide more information about menstruation as well as breast changes, hair and body odor, weight gain, and mood changes.
From 10-12, she will need to learn more details about menstruation, hygiene, and sexuality.
From ages 12 and up, talk to her about romantic relationships and physical affection, including holding hands, kissing, and sexuality. Talk to her about pressure, bullying, and self-image.

, As a parent you want your daughter to feel comfortable asking questions and coming to you with her concerns. However, if you don't cultivate an atmosphere of openness and safety in your home, she will feel obligated to find her answers elsewhere.


Spend time together as a family. Eat dinner together. Develop mutual hobbies like gardening, sports, or camping and do these things as a family.
Put away your tech. Encourage your family to be present in the moment during family times by eliminating distracting technology like phones, television, or game systems. The fewer distractions, the more likely your family will talk.
Talk about everything together. Keep a running dialogue with your child. Ask questions, tell her about your day, and be involved with her day to day life.
Prioritize her. If she comes to you with a question or wants to have a discussion, stop what you're doing if you can and talk to her. If you can't stop and talk then, schedule a time as soon as possible when you will talk to her about it. Follow through and actually have the conversation.

, Many people are uncomfortable talking about sex, the body, and puberty, and if you are one of them you may not even realize how your discomfort might affect the way you approach these topics with your daughter. If you talk about these things in a way that makes them seem forbidden, secret, or taboo, she will pick up on that from you.


Whispering or acting as if the subject is secret or shameful might convey to your daughter that there is something wrong with her body or that you are upset with her.
Remember that there is a difference between her privacy and secrecy.

, There are many books on the market that cover topics like anatomy, sexual reproduction, puberty, and other important issues in a straight forward and age appropriate way. Having books available gives your daughter a safe resource if she has questions or simple curiosity and does not feel comfortable asking.


Ask your librarian or local bookstore worker for suggestions, or visit parenting forums online to find recommendations.
While your daughter probably uses the internet for research for school projects, let her know about the dangers of searching online for topics related to sexuality and the body. It's important that you teach her from an early age that there are certain topics that are not safe to search online, not because you don't trust her, but because the internet contains dangerous things. Additionally, be sure your home computer has parental controls to block questionable websites. Many well-meaning children have stumbled upon pornography or other problematic sites while searching for information on puberty.

, You don't have to make a big deal out of it by telling her you need to have some serious conversation. You can just bring it up casually on a car ride or while you go for a walk in the neighborhood.Although it is great to foster an open family atmosphere where other siblings and both parents can have open discussions about puberty and sexuality, if your family is normally private or reticent about these things, now is probably not the time to force openness. She will probably not like her body changes being discussed in front of brothers or her father, in particular.

, If you feel nervous and you think it is affecting the conversation, you can be honest about that too! Tell her you're a little nervous to talk to her but you want to give her as much information as possible.


Being thorough, of course, doesn't mean you have to tell her everything you know on the topic during one conversation. Tell her what she needs to know, and let her ask questions if she wants to know more.

, Most girls won't have a lot of questions if you put them on the spot, but you can always keep the door open for questions in the future. Let her know that she can come to you with any questions at all, no matter how silly it might seem to her.


Promise her you will always be honest with her, and keep that promise. Let her know that you may not always know the answer, but you will help her to find it.When she does come to you with questions, never brush her off or laugh at her questions. It might seem funny at the time (""Mom, can I get pregnant from kissing?"") but laughing sends the message that you don't take her seriously. Remember, she does not have as much information or experience as you have.

, Your daughter may be embarrassed with all the details of sexuality and anatomy, and may not feel like talking much about it. Many times young girls are more interested in practical tips for navigating puberty, like how to treat acne, buy a bra, or avoid staining her underwear when her period starts.Many girls also enjoy hearing stories about their mother's experiences going through puberty. Don’t be afraid to share your best tips and stories, but remember to avoid telling her stories that will scare her or make her more anxious.

, Puberty describes a whole set of changes that occur over several years. These changes often follow a predictable pattern, so knowing what she might expect and in what order these changes may occur might ease her mind.


For most girls, the first sign of puberty is the development of breast buds. Her nipples may become more prominent as lumps develop behind them. Slowly, more breast tissue will develop. Her breasts may be uneven in size and tender, but this usually goes away in a few months. Breast buds usually appear around age 9 or 10, but can come earlier or later.The next stage of puberty for most girls involves hair growing in the pubic area. Pubic hair usually begins to grow a year to two years after the appearance of breast buds, but it can happen sooner or later. Usually this hair starts out thin and soft, and gets thicker and curlier over the next few years.
The next big milestone she should expect is menarche, or the first menstrual period. The average age for most girls' first period is around 12, but it can happen sooner or later., Girls going through puberty often feel like they are the only person in the world experiencing this change, so it's important that you tell her that this is common. At the same time, you want to reassure her that everyone changes at their own pace, and some girls experience more change than others.Your daughter may feel anxious if she is an early bloomer and has gotten breasts or her period before her peers. Similarly, she might feel self-conscious if she is the last in her group of friends to go through puberty. Let her know there is a wide variation on what is normal; for example, some girls start their periods at age 9, while others don't start until 16!, It is important that you have honest and thorough conversations with your daughter about the risks associated with sex before she ever has her first menstrual period. A girl can become pregnant even before she has had her first period, since an egg is released prior to the first monthly bleeding, and she will not know when the first egg has been released. You do not have to provide her with too many details, but she does need to know:


Sex always carries a risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, even if you use a condom.

, Your daughter should know her options for menstrual hygiene including tampons, maxi pads, and cloth pads. Let her make her own choices about what she feels comfortable using. Then, before she begins her first period, be sure she has the supplies she needs to feel prepared.


Most young girls are uncomfortable inserting tampons the first time, but they are available in slim or junior sizes to fit younger bodies. Explain how they work and see if she is interested in trying them. If not, she can rely on thin maxi pads with wings for period protection. Some girls may prefer to use cloth pads that can be laundered and reused. Show her each of these options and tell her how they are used. After she has started her period, let her experiment with different options if she wants to.
Teach her how to dispose of tampons or maxi pads discreetly by wrapping them in the wrapper before discarding in the trash. Be sure she knows not to flush them down the toilet-- even ""flushable"" tampons can clog drainage systems.
Use a small cosmetics bag or other discreet bag and pack a ""period readiness"" kit for her to keep in her backpack or purse. That way, if she starts her period for the first time while at school or out of the house, she'll have the supplies she needs. Include a panty liner, pads in a few different sizes, and a change of underwear.

, Hair in the armpits, pubic area, and thicker leg hair is a normal part of puberty and a sign of a healthy, developing body. There is no reason to shave it, but since many women do, your daughter may feel pressured to do so as well. If your daughter is uncomfortable with the hair in her armpits, teach her how to shave it safely if that is what she wants to do.


Let your daughter know that shaving her pubic hair is not a good idea. It can cause irritation and pain on the thin skin beneath it, and can lead to infections and in-grown hairs. If your daughter is uncomfortable with her pubic hair, offer her a pair of clean hair scissors to cut it.Keep in mind that in cultures where women are encouraged to have hairless bodies, many girls experience embarrassment or even shame about their developing body hair. Never tease your daughter about her hair or make disparaging remarks about hair on other women's or girls' bodies.

, When her breasts begin to develop, she may experience tenderness and pain, and this can be relieved by wearing a gently supportive bra or even a double-layered camisole. However, don't force her to wear a bra if she doesn't want to. Bras really are not necessary for your daughter's health.If she is self conscious about her breast buds, she may ask for a bra, but many girls do not want to wear one at this age. Follow her lead.

Ask them what they know.,
Inquire about their own opinions.,
Talk about advertising.,
Highlight the importance of voting.,
Discuss ways to get involved.",How to Talk with Kids About Political Ads1," Sit down with your child and ask them about what they know about elections, politics, and politicians. Get a feel for what your child knows and how they understand the political ads. This can help you gauge their understanding, their fears, and their questions. Knowing your child’s understanding can help guide you to talk to them in an age-appropriate way that addresses their concerns.For example, your young child may be fearful that a politician is saying things in a strong or powerful way, yet may not know what that person is talking about.
Your child may get information from political ads, social media, and friends. Even though they can parrot words, it does not mean they understand them.;
, For younger children, start getting them thinking about political issues. You can ask, “Why is it important to have schools? Are there good things about paying taxes?” For older children, engage them in their thoughts and ask them why they have those beliefs. What examples can support their view? Engage with your child and allow them to express and develop their own opinions.If your child’s opinion differs from your own, that’s okay. Ask them about it and let them know it’s okay to have different opinions from others. This can help them to develop tolerance for other viewpoints.

, Remind children that political ads are just that, advertising. Why else would they play around other commercials on television or the radio? Just like advertisements for toys, cars, and other items get people thinking about and wanting that item, political ads try to sway people toward a certain candidate through advertising.Tell your child that the ads may play to their emotions. Talk about any emotions they felt after watching an ad and what they think about it.
Talk about manipulation. Ads sometimes use words or images to manipulate a person’s feelings. Say, “What did it feel like to watch that ad? Did you feel like it made you feel something?”

, While your kids may not be old enough to vote, they likely will be one day. Set a good example for your children by explaining what voting is and why it is important. Let them know why it’s important to be informed before voting. Remind them that political ads are meant to help sway votes, yet nothing can replace the research you do on your own to make an informed decision.When you’re preparing for an election, get your kids involved in gathering information. Have them do internet searches about propositions or important issues facing the election. Then talk about it with them.
By expressing the value of voting, this can help encourage your children as they do reach the age to vote.

, If your child feels scared or inspired by issues raised by political ads, talk about ways to get involved. While politicians can make legislative decisions, each person can make a difference regarding social action. If your child is concerned about social issues, get them involved in volunteering at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter, animal shelter, or making steps to live with less environmental impact.Talk to your child about petitions and how they can help to voice concerns or support. You might want to include your child if you choose to sign a petition to show how each person’s voice can be heard.

Reassure your child.,
Talk about persuasion.,
Explain your reactions.,
Discuss bullying.,
Keep it age-appropriate.",How to Talk with Kids About Political Ads2," Your child may hear politicians talking about negative things such as a bad economy, job loss, home loss, or other scary things that may make your child fearful. Gently reassure your child about their concerns. Provide some perspective about the problem in an age-appropriate way. If the problems do affect your family, let your child know what you are doing to handle them.For example, say, “I know it scares you that the politician was talking about job losses. I want you to know that both of your parents have jobs and don’t worry about losing them. We will do everything we can to make sure you are taken care of.”
If your job is up in the air, say, “Yes, job loss might affect our family. I know you feel worried, and sometimes I worry, too. Yet, I will always do what I can to make sure you are okay.”

, When you and your child see an ad, spend some time decoding it. Talk about how the music, visuals, and claims are used to try to persuade people. Talk about how music and pictures can influence people.For example, a politician may use a photo of an unhappy family or run-down neighborhood then follow it up with a happy family and pleasant neighborhood when talking about themselves.


For a younger child, say, “What did the music sound like? Did it sound friendly or scary?” For older children, say, “How is that person trying to persuade others? Did they bend the truth at all? How did the visuals add to their message?”

, You might feel upset by a commercial or ad. Since kids can sense feelings but may not know where they come from or what caused them, they may feel like your upset is their fault. Let your child know that the commercial was upsetting to you and it has nothing to do with them. If you mute the television or change the radio channel, tell your child what’s going on.Make it clear that your reaction has nothing to do with your child.

, Some politicians use their air time to slam their opponents. They might call their opponent names or attach a label to them or to the campaign. Some children may begin to use this type of speech by parroting the speech or by bullying others. Remind your child that politicians do this to gain some kind of advantage or to change the subject. Make sure your child knows that it is not okay to bully others at home, at school, on the playground, or during activities.Even if your kid disagrees with someone else, teach them how to disagree respectfully and not use bullying or name-calling.

, While there are regulations regarding political ads, your child may still be exposed to content that is not appropriate for them. For example, some politicians point out their opponent’s scandals or draw attention to personal life matters. If your child begins to ask you about things that you deem inappropriate, have a response ready. You don’t need to answer the question, but do address your child’s concern.


For example, if your child finds out about a candidate’s infidelity scandals, say, “Yes, that person likely did some bad adult things. Sometimes, a person’s personal life gets talked about during elections. I’m sorry you had to hear that.”
if an ad comes on that you deem inappropriate, turn it off or mute it.

Interact on hot issues.,
Teach discretion.,
Share important political issues.,
Model how to disagree respectfully.",How to Talk with Kids About Political Ads3," While you may not want to discuss big issues such as abortion, immigration, racism, or the economy with younger children, teens are more ready to talk about these things. It may be uncomfortable for you to bring it up, yet, remember that your teen will be voting soon.If something comes up during a political ad, ask your teen, “What do you think about that?” Use the opportunity to have an important discussion with your teen and hear them out.

, Many youths get political news and information via social media. Politicians are quick to grab attention to themselves and their platforms by using social media to further their messages or even to insult their opponents. Especially with an upsurge of fake news stories, it’s important for youth to know what is credible.If your child brings up a story or commercial, ask them about the claims they heard. What makes the claims credible, and how do you find a credible news source?
This is a good time to talk about bias. If your teen’s news source is social media, tell them that anyone posting an article generally has a bias toward a politician or position. Some news sources may be biased, too, so talk about them with your child.

, If you feel strongly about the environment, share your views with your child. If a political ad mentions the environment, talk about how you agree or disagree with it. Consider discussing opposing candidates or positions about the environment and how you think their plans could alter the future.If there are issues you care deeply about, interact with your child about how the political ads address the issues. Ask, “What does this candidate say that the other one does not? How do you feel about her plans?”

, You might find that you and your child disagree on political topics and positions. Show your child that it’s okay to disagree with someone and that you can disagree in a respectful way. The best way to do this is to model the behavior. Find something that you agree with, elaborate on a specific point, then add to it. For example, you can say, “Yes, I agree it’s important to be informed about abortion, and it can be a very heated and debatable topic. You said that it’s important for a woman to have a choice, and I think it’s often important for a man to be heard, too.”Avoid using “but” as this can subtract and no add to an argument. Keep your speech positive.
Keep your tone of voice friendly and not hostile or defensive.

Role-play different scenarios.",How to Talk to Kids About Strangers," Discussing with your child, young or old, helps them to better understand what a stranger is, and that strangers are not all the same. While a stranger is someone that your child doesn't know, that doesn't mean that all strangers are to be feared. Get a handle on what your child thinks about strangers in order to address misconceptions.
Be aware of your child's personality and behaviors. If they are naturally fearful and cautious, they may have a different opinion of strangers than children who are very friendly and adventurous.;
, Talk about safety issues in a positive, open and reassuring manner. Avoid using scare tactics or sensational news stories as a way to explain about strangers that could harm your children. Focus on how safety is a matter of awareness and knowing what to do.Help to build your child's confidence in how to handle different situations with strangers by being a role model. Demonstrate conversations with store employees or emergency personnel that show your trust in strangers.
Children can have wild imaginations at times. Avoid painting a picture that strangers are evil kidnappers. Explain that it is very rare for strangers to want to harm children.

, Make it clear that not all strangers are bad people who are out to do harm. Explain to your children that you can't assume someone is good or bad just by looking at them, but there are generally good strangers and bad strangers to seek help from.Talk with them about strangers that they can trust such as police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel, store clerks in uniform, security guards, or a mother with other children.
Explore how strangers are not the same as villains.
Discuss about them about bad strangers. Include examples such as adults who are asking for help by pulling up in their cars asking for directions from children. Make it clear that a child should never enter a stranger's vehicle. Explain that if the situation seems uncomfortable, then this may be a warning sign of a bad interaction with a stranger.

, Young children may be apt to wander off and explore. Make it clear that there are boundaries of where they can go. Make it clear that adult supervision by a trusted person is crucial to help them stay safe.Establish clear boundaries in the home, in their front yard, in their neighborhood, at parks, and in public spaces.
For preschoolers and young kids, make it clear that adult supervision is required at all times. Say that, ""I need to see you at all times when we're out in public. Make sure to not leave my sight.""
Discuss about those same boundaries when at school or with other caregivers.

, When out in public places, make it clear that if a child is lost or alone that there are safe places to go. Show them the places that you consider safe, along with the routes to take that are safest in your area.Demonstrate the safe routes available by walking or riding with them in those areas and point them out.
Show them public places that are safer and where they are more likely to find trusted adults. These could include schools, stores, libraries, places of worship, and homes of trusted neighbors.
Have them avoid deserted areas where there are few people or large parking lots.

, Remind kids that when they feel lost or overwhelmed to seek the nearest safe space or trusted adult. Give them examples and tools about what to do when they need help.Establish rules about personal safety to your child. Remind them that when they're in trouble, it's important to remember their full name, address, phone number, name of parents, and how to use the phone to call 9-1-1.
For example, if they are lost in a mall, have them identify a store clerk or security guard that can help them feel safer. Tell them not to wander farther, but instead find help once they feel lost. Store employees are more likely to help and have a protocol in place to handle lost children.

, While it's important make sure your child understands safety, scary tactics will likely do more harm than good. Be calm and cautious in how you explain why it's important to stay safe.


Avoid warnings that could make your child very anxious such as, ""I might never see you again!"" or ""They could take you away from me.""
Focus on clear and matter-of-fact statements instead. If your child asks why they can't go with a stranger, consider saying, ""I want to make sure I know where you are and that you know how the follow the rules.""

, Talk with kids about how mean or scary-looking strangers may not be potential sources of harm. Explain how some strangers may act in sweet but manipulative ways to get a child to go with them. They may look like regular, nice people, but these actions may indicate bad intentions:Approaching a child by car and asking for directions or offering a ride
Offering treats or candy in a secluded place such as the person's car or home
Asking for help with a task such as helping to find a lost dog

, Encourage them to listen their own inner voice about what seems wrong with the situation. If something feels uncomfortable or just not right, they don't have to know why. Make sure they leave the situation when something feels wrong.Teach them to walk away or find a safe, public space immediately when they feel something's off.
Focus on teaching this to older kids that are better able to distinguish right from wrong than younger kids (under 6).

, If a kid is a approached alone by a stranger and the situation becomes increasingly dangerous or scary, give your child clear instructions of what to do in this situation. For example, if your child thinks he or she is being followed while walking alone, teach them these four steps:Say no.
Run away.
Yell when running away. This draws attention to yourself so that others can possibly help.
Tell a trusted adult what happened as soon as you can. Find a safe space nearby where others are present.

, Role-play some ""What if?"" scenarios with your children, young or old. This is a key way to teaching them how to handle difficult or tricky situations. For example, act out a scenario at a park in which a stranger approaches a child. Teach them to find the nearest parent with children, or another trusted adult.Teach kids to maintain a healthy distance, beyond an adult arm's reach, from a stranger. Demonstrate this action by acting as the stranger and showing your child a safe distance to stand from you.
Role-play scenarios should not be overly scary or sensational. Make it a positive learning experience.

Spend quality time with your child(ren).,
Practice respectful parenting.,
Don't pressure them to do something they aren't interested in.,
Be firm, but not punitive, when your child misbehaves.,
Take time to listen closely to them.,
Validate their feelings.,
Be a problem-solving team.",How to Talk to Kids About Tough Issues1," Go places together, whether it is the park or the zoo, and take time to chat and ask them about their lives. Share fun experiences together to build memories.;
, Respectful parenting encourages trust and autonomy, and helps children feel that you believe in them and their decision-making skills.


When you want them to do something, explain why.
Let them make decisions about their own lives: from what cereal they eat, to what they wear, to which color rug they want in their room. They will slowly gain confidence and a sense of responsibility.

, This includes things from joining a sports team to eating broccoli. This will show them that how they feel and what they want matters to you.


Instead of pressuring kids to share, tell kids to ask permission. For example, ""If you want to play with your sister's trucks, you'll have to ask her.""
Obviously, sometimes you need them to do something. In those cases, you can be calm and firm.

, It can be easy to lose your temper and yell or punish—or to give in. Take a deep breath, and give a clear ""no."" Follow up with a clear explanation of why their action was a bad choice.


""You need to sit in your car seat because it keeps you safe.""
""Hitting hurts people. It is not okay. I think you owe your brother an apology.""
""I know you don't want to go to bed right now. It's fun to stay and play. But you need to go to bed by 8:00, so you have enough sleep to be happy and healthy in the morning.""
""I am so upset right now, I need to take a break to cool off. Then I will decide how to handle this.""

, People, including children, want to feel heard and understood. Work on your listening skills so you can be attentive and helpful.

, Validating can soothe people and help handle their emotions. Recognize how your child is feeling, and let them know it's okay to feel that way. This can release tension, because you know and care about how they feel.


""I know it's fun to play at the park. I like it here too. But we do need to leave, so that we can eat lunch.""
""That sounds like a difficult day. I can understand why you're upset.""

, When you or your child identifies a problem, talk to them about how to solve it together. Brainstorm ideas and ask for their thoughts. See if you can come up with a solution that leaves both of you satisfied.

Choose a quiet time, when your kid will be able to listen well.,
Use a fairly neutral tone.,
Be honest.,
Take time to answer any questions that they ask.,
Talk about any feelings on the subject.,
Reassure them.",How to Talk to Kids About Tough Issues2," Find a time when they have eaten recently, and you'll have a stretch of time where you can talk. Long car rides and evenings can be good times to discuss things.


Choose a time when you have the patience to sit through the conversation, too!

, This will help reassure children. If you sound angry or disgusted, they might worry that it is their fault, or that there is something awful about the topic.


If you're explaining something sad, such as sickness or death, it's natural to feel a little sad. You can explain why you are sad.

, It can be tempting to fall back on cutesy stories (such as babies coming from storks), but children can often suspect when you aren't being truthful with them. Be honest with how things work, and if you think they can't handle the whole picture, then give them a simplified version of the truth. You can expand on this as they age.


For example, explaining sex: ""Babies happen when a mommy and a daddy go through a special process in their bedrooms. The daddy's sperm and the mommy's egg meet inside the mommy's belly. The sperm in the egg turn into a baby that grows in her belly, and when the baby is ready, it comes out.""
Or about disability: ""DNA is the instructions that tell your body how to build itself, kind of like computer code. Your sister has extra DNA in her body. This causes Down Syndrome, which is why she looks special and goes to the Special Ed classroom to learn.""

, The child might be curious on the subject, and this is your opportunity to clear up misconceptions and assuage fears. Give them honest answers.

, If this is a matter that personally affects you or them, one or both of you may have strong feelings. This also provides you a chance to model coping skills by sharing how you handle these difficult feelings.


""Yes, I do worry about Mommy's cancer. I love her very much and want her to feel good. When I feel worried about her, I focus on what I can do, like doing nice things for her and being there to hug her and hold her hand.""
""Daddy and I aren't getting along. It's very frustrating for both of us, so it's better off if we don't live together anymore. Sometimes I get mad and need to take some quiet time to calm down. This isn't your fault; it's just part of divorcing.""

, If your child is struggling with the concept, comfort them and let them talk it out. Show patience and understanding towards their feelings.


You don't need to say ""It'll be all right"" if it truly might not be all right. (Your child can usually tell.) Instead, try ""I'm here for you"" and ""We'll get through this together.""
Remind them that you're always here to talk.

Avoid negativity.,

Reward them when they get good grades.,
Always remember: every child is different.",How to Talk to a Child About a Bad Grade," Tell them that without good grades, many people won't be interested in hiring them for a job when they grow up.;
, It's fine to be upset with your child, but calling him/her a ""failure"" or commenting on his/her ""stupidity"" will only cause a decrease in self esteem. Degrading remarks can hurt more than you know. Let the child know that they've gotten a bad grade, but that doesn't mean they're bad kids! It just means they have to work a little harder.

, Make sure it is not too extreme however. Taking away phone, TV, or computer privileges is always an option.

, This can encourage the same sort of grades in the future. Verbal praise can sometimes mean more than a purchased reward- remember to consider that! A milkshake from a favorite diner and a ""Wow! I'm so proud of you!"" will get the job done right.

, If your child is utterly trying his/her best, and yet can only get about a C average, accept this. Some children do not excel in certain areas.

Consider the child's perspective.,
Avoid being too rigid.,
Speak honestly with parents about your issues.,
Engage in conversation with kids.,
Ask questions.,
Respond to temper tantrums with patience.,
Expect disgusting behavior.,
Practice deep breathing when you feel frustrated.",How to Stop Hating Children1," Children can be difficult to understand or control, but they are human beings nonetheless. Childhood is difficult. Children are faced with a constant struggle to grow, and learn new things about the world. Try to be sympathetic, and think of children as people instead of mere annoyances., Children can seem irrational, preferring to live moment-to-moment rather than following rigidly defined schedules or plans. If you tend to think very logically at all times, this can be frustrating. Rather than trying to stick to a predefined schedule of activities, opt for a more open-ended plan, such as a trip to the park, or a simple play session in the child's familiar environment. Children often thrive in such unstructured activities, bouncing from activity to activity as their mood and level of energy changes., Explain that you have difficulty understanding and liking children, but are working to get better. Ask them for help in getting to know their child. Many parents are quite enthusiastic to teach others what they have learned through parenting, and few people are more well-equipped to understand the frustrations and pitfalls of interacting with children.

, It is common to ""talk down"" to children, especially if you have little experience dealing with them. This should be avoided, as it can alienate a child. Don't try to limit your vocabulary, but instead talk to them in a normal, friendly tone, just as you would with an adult. Make sure the child has plenty of time to talk, and avoid telling long stories or speaking at length, as the child may have trouble sustaining attention.Don't worry too much about whether the child you're talking to you will understand what you're saying. If the child is interested, he or she will often ask for clarification, leading to further possibilities for conversation.
You should, of course, refrain from using inappropriate language, or bringing up ""adults only"" subjects around kids.

, Remember that children, while not yet fully developed, are people with personalities, interests and memories. Asking questions will help a child engage with you, since the child may not often feel comfortable speaking first in interactions with adults. The more you learn about a child's inner life, the easier it will be for you to see the child as a person of value.A common mistake is to ask children overly ""easy"", simple questions. Ask open-ended questions, requiring more than a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" to answer. This will encourage the child to start a real dialogue with you.
Avoid cliche questions like ""What's your favorite subject in school?"" Children are used to hearing these questions, and it may not seem to them that you're really interested in learning about them.
Many children enjoy telling stories about themselves, and are often very gratified to have an adult listen to them. Ask if anything exciting has happened to them recently, or ask about any recent trips, holidays or other events in their lives.

, It is easy to become upset with a child who is displaying loud, dramatic behaviors like screaming, flailing, or holding their breath. You should resist the temptation to raise your voice, or become upset yourself. This will only worsen the tantrum, leading to increased frustration for both of you. Try to remain calm, and distract the child from whatever is upsetting him or her.A favorite toy or game is a great way of distracting a child who is throwing a temper tantrum. You can also try talking with the child about something he or she enjoys.
Funny faces are a parent's standby for combating temper tantrums in very young children.

, Many people have a hard time getting over how gross kids can seem. Nose-picking, burping, drooling and other hard-to-watch behaviors may make you cringe, but they are nonetheless a normal part of a child's development. Try to keep an open mind, and remember that you probably displayed many such behaviors as a child. Ignore the behavior as best you can, and only intervene if the child's health or safety is in danger., Children are unpredictable, and often noisy, and can be of great annoyance to people who are not naturally patient. Take a deep breath, count to 10, and remind yourself that you are working towards a better relationship with children when you refuse to give in to impatience."

Understand that children change as they grow.,
Talk to your child.,
Enforce fair rules.,
Choose activities to share with your child that you both enjoy.,
Be forgiving.,
Show love and approval.,
Ask for help from other parents.,
Talk with a counselor or therapist.,
Take action if you experience hateful thoughts.",How to Stop Hating Children2," All children pass through difficult stages, especially during puberty. Be patient, and try your best to guide your children through these stages, even if you sometimes find it difficult to like them. , While it may seem that you and your child occupy different planets, it is nonetheless important that you make an effort to communicate issues in your relationship. Try to be calm and diplomatic, and let your child know that you love him or her, and want your relationship to improve.

, Many parents struggle to find balance between being too strict with their kids, and being too lenient. This can create tension in your relationship with your child, resulting in fighting and resentment. If you find yourself in constant conflict with your child regarding the rules of the house, then it may be time to reevaluate those rules.Over-emphasizing rules and discipline can be a burden on your relationship with your child. Strict rules are harder to enforce consistently, and put lots of pressure on your child.
Being too lenient with children can make it difficult for them to respect you, and can lead to parents feeling powerless and used.
Make changes to your disciplinary approach gradually, and be sure to talk to your child about why the rules are changing. Let your child know that you want your relationship to improve, and are trying to make changes to allow that to happen.
Be sure to share your household rules with anyone else who cares for your child, so that the rules can be applied consistently, regardless of who is present.

, Don't simply go along with what your child wants or what other parents do with their children. If you consistently only do things with your child that you don't enjoy, you may grow to dread and resent being with them. If your child is old enough, talk to them about their interests, and try to explore areas of common ground to find activities you both enjoy.


Feel free to let your child know if you don't enjoy an activity they want to pursue, such as watching an already familiar movie, or playing a video game. Offer your child some alternatives, or invite your child to do what the or she wants without you.
Be patient and persistent. It may take time for you to discover areas of common interest with your children, but if you are successful your relationship will benefit greatly.

, In a typical parent/child relationship, there is often plenty to disagree or feel resentful about. Household arguments can lead to lingering resentments that can cloud your relationship with your child, and push you apart. Make a conscious effort to be forgiving of your child once a situation has been resolved, rather than harboring resentment or being passive-aggressive.Being forgiving does not necessarily mean being lenient. Make it clear to your child that you will forgive him once the admits responsibility for his actions. Remind him that you love him unconditionally, and are working hard to improve your relationship.

, A child who is often scolded or punished, and seldom praised, may start to believe that her parents don't love her. If you find yourself disciplining your child more often than praising her, take some time to sit down with her and express your love. Whenever you notice that your child has done well, or is proud of something she has accomplished, be sure to explicitly praise her, and tell her you are proud., Raising a child can be extraordinarily difficult, so there's no shame in reaching out for assistance. Your own parents, or other people in your community who have children, can be an excellent resource for advice.

, If problems in your relationship with the children in your life have become overwhelming, and seem impossible for you to handle yourself, don't lose hope: there are many counselors and psychiatrists who specialize in family therapy. They are trained to help you, and your family, identify and solve problems in your relationships with one another.


If you need help finding a family specialist, ask your doctor for a referral, or contact your medical insurance provider.

, Violent thoughts about the children in your life are not normal. Even if you would never wish harm on a child when clear-headed, hateful feelings can become overwhelming, leading to potentially devastating, irreversible consequences for you and your family. If you feel that your children are in danger as a result of your own hateful or violent thoughts, place them in the care of a trusted friend or family member, remove yourself from the situation, and seek emergency medical help immediately. Unwanted thoughts of harming your children may be a symptom of a serious mental illness such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. If you are experiencing such symptoms, you need and deserve the care of a professional mental health expert in dealing with your issues.

Encourage cooperation.,
Correct inappropriate language or behaviors.,
Schedule brief, one-on-one play-dates.,
Consider daycare.,
Model healthy social behaviors to young kids.",How to Socialize Young Kids when You Are Introverted1," At the foundation of socialization is the ability to be able to work and play with others. One of the most valuable things you can do is teach your young children how to share and take turns. These character traits are at the core of being likeable to other children, and making new friendships as a kid. What’s more, cooperation is also a good quality to have for excelling in school.


Cooperation involves listening while others are talking, giving everyone a chance to participate in a game or activity, respecting others when it’s their turn, working with others towards a common goal, and solving problems.
You can help your young child learn how to cooperate by playing simple games with multiple players. Admonish them by saying “Remember, everyone gets a turn” when they are not cooperative. Praise them with a simple “Nice job taking turns!” when they demonstrate this competency.;
, Just as your child should be able to work well with others, it’s also important for them to refrain from engaging in behaviors that are harmful to others or unsuitable for their age.


Help your child become appropriately socialized by firmly reminding them of the correct way to speak or act in a given situation. You should do this immediately after they demonstrate the unacceptable behavior so that they understand why they are being corrected.
You might say, “No, Jared. There is no pushing in line!” to remind your son to keep his hands to himself.Be sure to give your child more praise than criticism. Too much criticism may damage your child's self-esteem over time., Early on, it can be overwhelming for both you and your younger child to advance into group socialization too quickly. Start small. Arrange a short visit with a neighbor’s kid or a friend from school. At this point, ensure that both parents are present. Monitor how your child is behaving with the other child in terms of sharing, working together, and avoiding unacceptable behaviors. Stay close so that you can end the visit if the children become bored or upset.


As your child becomes comfortable playing with the other child, you might start dropping him or her off or allowing the other child to visit without the parent being present. As your child gets acclimated with one-on-one visits, it’s appropriate to slowly graduate to small group play-dates where several children are present at once., Many parents are wary of leaving their kids with relative strangers during the day. But, if you are an introvert who very rarely seeks out social engagement, it can be beneficial for your child to attend daycare. Your child learns socialization through daycare because they have to get used to being separate from you and managing their emotions.


Other socialization benefits of daycare include learning to work in groups, learning to share, and learning how to solve problems. In addition to helping your children meet and play with other children, daycare can also reduce your stress, too. These advantages occur in a high-quality program. Quality daycare is defined by the amount of time providers spend interacting with the children in addition to the level of support, warmth, and cognitive stimulation received in the programs., You may not like the idea, but helping your child develop adequate social skills requires that you are more aware of your own social habits. Your child is watching you, and, sometimes, they pick up undesirable social skills from shy or introverted parents. To help your child pick up good habits, be more mindful of your own.


Speak clearly and confidently when you address others rather than whispering or mumbling through your words.
Make occasional eye contact when you are interacting with others.
Greet others appropriately, depending on your relationship, whether by a firm handshake and a smile or a friendly hug."
"
Let your kid do the talking.,
Go to the park or playground.,
Link up with other introvert moms.,
Do something relaxing before socializing.",How to Socialize Young Kids when You Are Introverted2," If the idea of facing a group of kids and parents makes you sweat, let your child decide on the level of engagement they’d like. Rather than assuming you aren’t providing adequate opportunity for socialization, seek your child’s involvement.


Work with his or her personality and preferences to determine the right level of engagement. Your child may not necessarily be an extrovert, so don’t assume they want non-stop interaction with other kids.You might do a trial and take them to a setting where other children are playing nearby. Then, ask, “Do you want to go and join them?” See if your child is interested. Maybe you can help make introductions or perhaps they would rather warm up first by playing alone before making any new friends. You don't want to force your child to interact, but you also don't want to act shy or uncomfortable yourself and unintentionally turn them off of the interaction.

, Going to the local park offers a wonderful opportunity for your child to play with other children.However, simply because your kid desires social interaction doesn’t mean you are forced to fake small talk. If you want to send the message to others that you’d prefer to simply observe, bring a book or creative project along.

, The best case scenario for introverted parents hoping to socialize their young kids is by finding other parents with introvert qualities. That way, you can fulfill your need for intimate, one-on-one social connection while also giving your child the opportunity to meet and bond with other children.Not sure how to spot other introverted parents? You could always start a Meetup for introverted parents. Open the group to other parents in your area and see who joins. The parents can engage in one-on-one or small group gatherings that are introvert-approved like book clubs, film reviews, or baking. Meanwhile, the children are free to socialize as they please. It’s a win-win for everyone!

, If fulfilling your young kid’s social appetite means draining your introvert batteries, be sure to fully charge before the outing. Create a calming ritual to perform before leaving home to meet friends or before having company over for play-dates.


Grab in a bit of alone time to relax prior to entering draining social situations. You might read a chapter of your current novel. Do deep breathing. Get in a workout to release endorphins and boost your mood. Or, simply watch an episode of your favorite TV show."
"
Request that your partner/co-parent chaperone some events.,
Sign your kid up for organized extra-curriculars.,
Take advantage of community events for children.,
Connect your child with neighbors’ kids or distant relatives.",How to Socialize Young Kids when You Are Introverted3," If you are co-parenting your children, it may help to delegate some of the social activities to them. Perhaps your spouse, partner, or the children’s other parent doesn’t mind attending birthday parties or school festivals. When they take them out to planned events, you’ll have extra downtime to recharge your batteries and regroup.


Sit down with them and say, “I know the kids need socialization, but all these social events are too much for me. Do you mind taking them to some of them each week to give me a break?”, Play-dates and get-togethers hosted by parents aren’t the only way to help your child learn adequate social skills. Afterschool activities in the form of sports, drama, music, or various clubs and organizations can help your child feel more connected to other children at school. In addition, these groups help children meet kids with similar interests and develop new abilities.Sign your young child up for a music or sports program in which you can drop them off. This gives you a much-needed break and also allows them to develop relationships outside of family.

, Events held in your local community also serve as platforms for friendship-making. Does your area have a 4-H Club, Boys or Girl Scouts, or a range of other interactive organizations? Do you attend religious or spiritual gatherings?


Getting your child involved in community events through various organizations helps them learn the value of volunteerism and servant leadership while presenting a range of opportunities to learn, meet new friends, and build self-esteem., Sometimes, a potential friend is much closer than you think. If the idea of going out into the community and organizing play-dates makes you want to climb back into bed, you could consider introducing your kids to friends they can naturally hang out with. Family members such as the kids of your siblings or cousins, the children of in-laws, and the neighbors’ kids are all possible outlets for socialization.


The perk of these connections is that you really don’t have to stray too far from your comfort zone for your kid to be engaged. Walk over and introduce your child to the neighbors’ kids and plan a play-date. Or, invite your extended family over for Sunday dinner and make sure they bring their kids along.

Place the chart in an area where the child will see it often, such as the refrigerator or in the child's room. Every time your child succeeds, draw or stick a star onto the chart next to his name. Mark milestones on the chart, where the child gets a special reward for reaching that point.;
, This may be more appropriate for a child 12 years old or older, who may be able to focus on longer-term behavioral goals. For example, the child can mark the calendar with an ""X"" every day he completes homework without being told to do so. Give the child the reward after a complete week has been marked, or based on the number of ""X""s before a certain deadline.


If you want to reward chores, mark them on the calendar with a check box next to them.

, Use a timer or a clock to time your child in completing a task such as picking up toys or completing chores. This can help with children who keep putting off tasks. The child only earns the reward if he or she completes the task before the deadline.

, Decide on the specific behaviors you want to change or encourage in your child. These can be negative habits you want to discourage, such as lying or leaving toys on the floor, or positive habits you'd like to encourage, such as following a bedtime routine. Consider starting with just one or two behaviors, while your child is getting used to the system.

, Choose rewards based on the child's age and what the child wants. Here are a few ideas:


A child under the age of six may respond to a reward of stars placed on a chart next to his name.
For small chores, offer candy, or a short TV or computer session.
For big achievements or prolonged good behavior, offer to buy a toy or go on a day trip.
Some children respond best to privileges, such as getting to stay up late or go to a sleepover.

, Let the kids give feedback on what chores they'd like to do and what rewards they'd like to earn. Make it clear that the final call is up to you, but listen to what they have to say. They'll do more work if they're excited about the rewards.


If the kids can't agree on a fair way to split the chores, roll dice to divide the chores. Change it every month so no one gets stuck too long with bad luck.

, Older children may appreciate having more choice. Let them earn tokens, and make several prizes available that the child can get by trading in tokens.


You can use Monopoly money as tokens.

, Explain the correct behavior (what to do and what not to do) so that your child understands what you want. Be very clear about how the child earns rewards, and explain that there won't be any rewards if the behavior doesn't happen.


Make it clear when the child will receive the reward. Does the child get a treat as soon as the chore is done, or as a dessert after dinner that night?

, For a behavior reward system to work, you must be consistent. Issue the reward every time your child earns it. Do this right away or make it very clear when the reward will happen. Similarly, do not give your child the reward if he has not earned it. If you aren't consistent, the child may lose trust in the system and refuse to cooperate.


If you want to give your child an extra treat for a different reason, choose a reward he can't get with this system.

, Kids work better with routines and predictable systems. Keep the chart or calendar in a visible location, and remind the kids of the tasks at the same time every day. If you establish a consistent routine, you will give your child a goal to work toward.

, The reward system is supposed to motivate the child to change her behavior on her own. Unless something absolutely must get done, don't force your child to complete the task. Remind her of the task and the reward as many times as you think appropriate, but then let her make the decision on her own.


If she doesn't change her behavior at all, you may need to try different rewards or a different system.

, Make sure you give plenty of praise when your child earns a reward. Start by thanking or praising the child, then give the reward. This helps reinforce the intrinsic value of the good behavior, instead of making it only about personal benefit.

, The ""punishment"" in the rewards system is not getting a reward. Leave more severe punishments for extra-bad behavior, not failing to get a star on the reward chart. If the child forms negative associations with the reward system, he may stop cooperating.

, If your child asks for a toy but hasn't earned it, remind her that she didn't earn a reward.


If your child tries to get a promise out of you (""If I do this will you get me that?""), just remind her how the system works. Say ""Do you think you can earn a reward this week? You tell me."" A direct promise can undermine the reward system and make it about trying to manipulate you directly.

, Competition can be a fun motivator, but it can also lead to jealousy or fighting. Start with little surprises, like ""first person in the car gets the front seat on the next trip."" If your kids are mature enough to handle it, you can consider a bonus reward that you give to the best-behaved kid each week.


It might not be fair to have children of different ages compete.

, If the child has mastered a behavior, consider gradually reducing its rewards and adding new behaviors to encourage. If the child is excited about the system, add harder tasks with better rewards.


Remember to stay as consistent as possible. Your child may rebel against the system if he suddenly can't get the usual reward.

Warm up your baby.,
Massage your baby to calm his stomach spasms.,
Help your baby do exercises that prompt bowel movement.,
Lay your baby on his tummy.,
Hold your baby in different positions.,
Drive your baby in your car to calm him.",How to Settle a Baby's Upset Stomach1," Warming up your baby will relax her body, and provide relief to a tense and cramped stomach. To warm your baby, put her in a blanket.Curl up with your baby to provide your body heat.A warm bath may also help calm her tummy.;
, Try massaging your baby's tummy in a circular motion, clockwise, to relieve pain and pressure in his gastrointestinal tract. You can use baby oil, warmed up between your hands. A massage improves blood circulation in the baby's stomach, which can help calm colic., You can help your baby do bicycling exercises that will prompt the acceleration of digestion and bowel movements. Be very gentle with your baby and do the exercise on a soft surface.


Place your baby on her back.
Take her legs and gently move them in a bicycling motion.
Continue this exercise for a few minutes to achieve the full effect of the exercise.

, Laying your baby on his tummy can allow gas to escape more easily. Only do this when your baby is already old enough to roll over on his tummy and support his head.


Letting him spend some time in this position will help relieve pressure caused by trapped gas.
Only this when you are with your baby, and don't put your baby to sleep on his tummy.

Try slower feedings.,
Eat properly to create healthy breastmilk for your baby.,
Think about what you ate before your baby’s stomach became upset.,
Pay attention to the way your baby is feeding.,
Burp your baby to expel excess air.,
Try a different formula.,
Seek medical help if your baby can’t seem to get any relief.",How to Settle a Baby's Upset Stomach2," Also try shorter periods between feedings. Sometimes if the baby isn’t as hungry, she will eat more slowly, making it less likely that she will get air in with the milk. Air bubbles are often a culprit of colic, and slower feedings more often can help alleviate them., Be mindful of your eating habits and avoid substances in your food that can be excreted through your milk and adversely affect your baby's stomach. Stay away from anything that can cause bloating and gas.. You might also want to try avoiding the following foods to see if it helps:Caffeine
Alcohol
Dairy products
Cabbage
Beans
Peas
Green beans
Mushrooms
Soy
Spicy foods
Oranges
Strawberries
Cauliflower

, See if you can identify what might have caused the problem. If it hurts your stomach, chances are it will also hurt your baby’s.

, Whether you breastfeed or use a bottle, there is a possibility in both methods for your baby to get air bubbles in his stomach, causing discomfort. Closely observe your baby when her is feeding to see if her is feeding properly.Make sure your baby is making a tight seal with his lips and not swallowing air.
Swallowing air can cause gas and abdominal pain.
If you think your baby's bottle is producing a lot of air, try changing the nipple, with a hole that has a size appropriate for your baby. Or try different types of bottles. The bottles with the bag inside may cause the baby to swallow less air.
Make sure to keep your baby upright when feeding, and don't allow a baby to take a bottle in bed or when lying down.

, This should happen each time you feed your infant. Burp your baby to allow air to escape from her stomach and relieve pressure in the stomach. You can do this by lifting your baby and gently but firmly tapping her on the back., It might be an ingredient in the formula that is affecting your baby’s stomach. As with breastmilk, different babies react differently to ingredients, and some of those in formula may cause your baby to become bloated or gassy.


Talk to your doctor before changing formulas, as most of the time the formula is not the problem.

, It might be something different — with babies it’s so difficult to tell what might be bothering them. Your pediatrician should have some ideas about what might be ailing your baby.

, Maintaining your baby's hydration is crucial to help him recover from a viral infection. Vomiting and diarrhea can dehydrate your baby, and you need to combat this by allowing your baby to drink plenty of breastmilk or formula, or water if he is old enough.An oral electrolyte solution, like Pedialyte or Enfalyte, can be offered as well.

, If your baby is old enough for food, soup is an excellent way to replenish electrolytes and other nutrients that have been lost through diarrhea and vomit.


Feed the soup a little bit at a time, not all at once.
Try offering one teaspoon of soup every five minutes.

, If your baby is dehydrated, lethargic or very tired, and irritable, take him to the doctor to receive medical attention.You can identify severe dehydration if your baby has a dry mouth, dry and hot skin, a cold sweat, a sunken fontanel (soft spot), no tears when crying, and is not urinating enough. A baby should urinate at least three times in 24 hours or at least once in eight hours.
Your doctor will prescribe a means for rapid rehydration or will give him an infusion of fluids through an IV.

Vomiting that persists for more than 12–24 hours, or diarrhea that persists for more than seven days or is very frequent.
Vomiting forcefully, or vomit that is green or has blood in it.
High fever. This, when combined with an upset stomach, could be a symptom of several things, which could range from food poisoning to an infection. It is best to bring your baby to a doctor immediately for proper diagnosis and treatment.
These symptoms could be indicating something more dangerous than trapped gas, such as food allergies, infection, intestinal blockage, or poisoning.
If you think your baby has swallowed something toxic, such as a drug, plant or chemical, and is showing symptoms of poisoning through vomiting and diarrhea, call your national emergency hotline immediately (at 1-800-222-1222 in the United States)."

They should know that your love will not disappear just because of any bad actions or behavior.Tell your children that you support them no matter what. Children who feel supported by adults are more likely to be confident and adventurous in what they do.Correct bad behavior, but be sure to say that the action is bad, not the child. Doing bad things is different from being a bad child. If the child thinks he or she is bad, they may develop poor self-esteem.;
, Give them space to explore their interests and talents. Trying new things makes children feel better about themselves and gain confidence in their abilities.


Tell children to try out new things. They should not be scared to do something different. Remind them that you’ll be there to help them if they need it.
Get them involved in good learning experiences, especially those involving other children like athletic teams or volunteer groups. Anything where your children work together with other kids helps them build self-confidence.
Give children positive feedback. Children need to hear affirmation by parents of their activities. Let them know you’re proud of them for trying something new even if it doesn’t work out.As you encourage your child, try to focus on the behaviors you want to see more of, instead of offering praise that is disconnected from your child's positive actions. Instead of saying ""You are so brave!"" try saying ""I know it was scary to try that, but you did a great job overcoming your fear!"" , Working on chores around the household can give children a sense of ownership and responsibility. Even something as simple as cleaning up their room can give children an increased sense of self-confidence.Keep a regular chore time.

Time your chore activities. Don't overwhelm your children with chores. Spend less than 10 minutes on chores for kids under 7, 15-25 minutes for kids 8-10, and 25-45 minutes for kids over ten.Do chores before a fun activity. This makes the chores easier to get through and makes the fun activity more rewarding for the child.

, Let them see the entire process through so they can feel good about themselves. Working together on a puzzle and letting them finish the final piece can give them a sense of accomplishment.

Set goals for children that are age-appropriate. Younger children need simple goals that are more immediate, whereas older kids can handle more abstract goals.Discuss goals as cooperative, rather than competitive. Cooperative goals are those when you work with others, whereas competitive goals are those against others. Goals that help students feel like a part of a group give them more self-esteem than those that make them feel good only as an individual.
Tell your children to fight for their goals. Make sure they don't give up easily, but instead keep striving. Dealing with setbacks help self-confidence.

, Make them feel like they are part of a group and belong with others around their age. Have them work together with others in play groups or during preschool.Encourage children to play with friends.

Recognize that severe nail biting might be a symptom of another medical condition.In these cases, it is more than just a bad habit.,
Recognize that nail biting can damage your child’s health.Some of the physical consequences of nail biting are:


Bleeding nails.,
Seek medical attention for serious cases of anxiety or fingernail biting.",How to Stop Children from Biting Their Fingernails3,"


Ask your doctor if your child’s nail biting could be caused by a disorder called onychophagia.
Be aware that psychiatrists recently reclassified severe nail biting to be a type of pathological grooming. The American Psychiatric Association’s “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,” classifies nail biting as a form of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).
Be aware that less common forms of pathological grooming are hair pulling and skin picking.,
Skin infections in the area around the nails.Red and sore fingers.
The spread of bacterial and viral infections from the nail to the mouth.
Poorly aligned and weakened teeth.

, A psychologist or psychiatrist might be able to help.Ask your doctor if your child might benefit from therapy. Determine if you or another relative have a severe case of nail biting. Since nail biting is usually genetic, your doctor may be able to better diagnose your child’s condition if he knows the medical histories of other family members. "

Help children deal with failure.,
Validate children’s feelings.,
Don’t compare a child to other children.,
Be aware of difficult circumstances.,
Avoid going too far when building your child’s confidence.",How to Stimulate Children's Self Confidence2," Failure is inevitable when kids try new things. Encourage them to use failure as motivation and to learn from it.


Ask them to reflect on any failures and get something positive out of it. If they did poorly on a big test, talk about how they could improve for the next test. Don't dwell on past failures, but learn from them.Talk to them about what “failure” means. Failure is not just winning or losing, but it's also part of preparation. Trying hard and not succeeding is not a failure, but not trying hard can be.
Don’t sugarcoat anything. If they did fail at something, make sure to note that, but not focus on it. Children should know that failure is a part of life. Knowing how to fail is an important skill they need to learn.
Make an improvement plan. Your child should have a clear plan about how to avoid failures in the future. Set clear goals and deadlines to plan for success.

, Make sure they know their feelings are valuable, even if they are negative feelings of hurt or anger. They should not learn that certain feelings are not acceptable. Otherwise, they may stifle their emotions and feel guilty about having them.If children are upset, let them share their feelings. Don’t try to interrupt them when they are telling you how they feel.
Use positive language to talk about children’s emotions. Don’t look at emotions as “good” or “bad”. Instead, talk about emotions as something that is natural and part of life.
After they share their feelings, point out the positive things that have happened. Share with them how any negative events can have positive outcomes., Comparing children to others around them can make them feel bad about themselves or overly competitive. Instead, encourage cooperation rather than competition with others.


Talk to children about their behavior by itself. Don’t talk about how they did “better” or “worse” than others, but instead how “well” they did. Competition with others can hurt children's self-esteem.
Tell your children to think about how their behavior affects others. They should be a “good sport” in all that they do.
Avoid competitive language. While this may be more difficult in children’s sports, talk to your child about competition being about the love of a shared activity, rather than “winning” or “losing”.
Focus on cooperation with others. Talk to your child about being a good teammate rather than being a great competitor.

, If the child has been through difficult events recently, they may have self-esteem issues. Work with them as they try to develop healthy self-esteem.Know about any recent family trauma. Family trauma, including physical or mental abuse, could severely impact a child’s self-esteem.
Pay attention to any trouble at school with bullying. Bullying, whether it’s from another child or an adult, can make kids feel less sure about themselves and less safe.
Encourage children to talk to you about things they are struggling with. They should feel comfortable talking to you if they are struggling with their self-esteem.

, Sometimes children may in danger of being too confident or becoming entitled. Try to guard against overconfidence by being realistic with children.Be warm towards children and show that you care. Caring doesn't mean praise, but rather unconditional love not based on their failures or successes.
Don’t overvalue your children as extraordinary or unique. Making children think that they are better than other kids can cause them to become arrogant.
Consider detoxing your kids from excessive praise. Work on using language that praises behavior rather than the person."
"
Model acceptance for your child.,
Identify negative self-esteem in your own life.,
Play with your child.",How to Stimulate Children's Self Confidence3," Try to act in a way that illustrates you have good self-esteem. Don’t put others down and don’t let them put you down.Never criticize your appearance in front of your child. Don't say you need to lose weight or look like someone else.
Talk about your strengths, such as your work goals. Talk to your children about how hard you work to reach your goals.
Feel good about yourself and your accomplishments. Kids pick up on the ways in which you talk about yourself and your work.
Be compassionate towards others. Try to understand why others are doing things and try not to blame them for behavior you don’t agree with.
Don’t put down other people. Demeaning others in front of children can make them feel like it’s ok. Instead, try to be accepting and generous towards them.

, If you have negative self-esteem, it may rub off on your child. Make sure you repair any negative self-esteem so you don’t pass it along to kids.Think about the ways your parents built your self-image. If you don’t find their strategies useful or productive, avoid them with your own children. There's no reason you cannot raise your kids a different way than you were raised.
Don’t be too harsh towards your own parents. Dwelling on the past can negatively affect the future. Take what you can from their self-confidence tactics and move on.
Try to build your own self-esteem. Use positive self-talk to avoid negativity and feel good about yourself and what you do., Children who get a lot of playtime with adults tend to have higher self-esteem. They feel valued and loved by others.Let your child come up with play activities. Instead of suggesting how or what to play, let the child figure out what they want to do. They’ll be more engaged and more interested.
Focus your attention on your child during play. Don’t get distracted by your own worries. Be available and present during play.
Think of play as part of raising your child, not just fun. Play helps children to becoming more imaginative and creative. They gain confidence in their abilities through play and games.

Help your children accomplish the most important job of adolescence: breaking away from YOU.,
Set healthy boundaries.,
Pick your battles; don’t sweat the small stuff.,
Don't go it alone.,
Does your kid know that you are proud of them and believe in them?,
Don’t smother.","How to Raise Respectful, Confident Teenagers"," Compliance is not your goal. Their developmental task is individuation, which means growing up into their own person. It is normal, healthy and NECESSARY for them to question your values and what you think. Expect them to disagree—and in fact, celebrate it. You get to help them navigate this transition—but you can’t do it for them. So don’t see every conflict as personal. They need you, but not to keep them contained, but to help them grow. Your role as a parent is shifting—to that of a coach who equips them to succeed. In their book Break Through, Tim Clinton and Pat Springle point out, ""Effective parents accept changes in the relationship...parents are parenting their children through a transition into adulthood."";
, If your child makes a bad choice, but you rescue him from the consequences, then you don’t have good boundaries. This is not just about rules, but about refusing to step in and rescue too quickly. Boundaries say—this is me, and this is you. If I do something wrong, I’ve got to deal with the fallout. If you do something wrong, YOU get to suffer the consequences. Often, the best thing to say to your kids if they make a mistake is “you have a problem. But I’m sure you can solve it.” NOT: “Oh, no, let me solve your problem for you.”

, Too many rules and restrictions, or taking over your kids’ decisions, will backfire. Don’t become a helicopter parent, especially at this stage of the game. While strict parenting might control their behavior in the short term, it will stunt their growth. Think of your teen as an adult in training. How would you feel if someone told you what your every move should be? Dr. Tim Clinton, a clinical psychologist, points out in his book Break Through: “Smothering and demanding behavior communicate, ‘I don’t trust you, and I don’t believe you’re competent to make choices without me.’ This produces insecure, angry young men and women who aren’t prepared to make it in the adult world.”

, Talk to another parent about what's going on--and you'll realize your kid is normal. Someone who is less emotionally involved can sometimes help you have a healthy perspective. Be sure to present a united front with your spouse—don’t let your child play you against each other. If you're a single parent, find other adults who can support you and also spend time with your kids.

, Be sure to tell them that you’re their biggest fan. Train yourself to look for positive traits, accomplishments and strengths, and TELL your child what you see. Catch them doing right. Every day, give them a situation where they can spread their wings, and you can tell them, “I trust you.” Let your child know that you love them—even when you disagree with their actions or opinions. Try to build them up rather than tear them down. There’s a right and wrong way to build self esteem in kids. Tell them you love them and think they're great, but also be sure to praise specific things they DO. As Clinton and Springle point out, ""every kid needs at least one person who is crazy about them!"" And if that person is their mom or dad, that kid is going to be confident about themselves.

, Allow them to make mistakes, don’t rescue them from the consequences of their behavior. As Stephen Covey says, “begin with the end in mind.” And the “end” goal of parenting is your child’s independence. Although it’s hard to let go, you don’t want them to remain dependent on you forever. When you’re tempted to cling or control, bring to mind a picture of your child at age 40. Is he or she sleeping on your couch? Yikes! On the journey toward independence, mistakes are part of the learning process. Remember when your child was a baby just learning to walk? You didn’t expect them to walk without falling the first time they tried it as a baby. Nor did you say, the first time they landed on their diapered bottom, “Okay, that’s it—walking is too dangerous, you’re just not ready. I’m going to carry you for the next few years.” But that’s what some parents do by not letting their teens make some mistakes. Sure, there’s more at stake—but ultimately, that greater risk will lead to a greater reward: an independent, functioning adult!

Remember that your child’s behavior isn’t personal.,
Take a deep breath.,
Communicate calmly.",How to Respond when Your Preschooler Calls You Names1," Your child’s name-calling is about their own feelings of anger or powerlessness, not about you. Preschoolers act out because they don’t have the coping skills or empathy to find better solutions to their problems yet.It’s still normal to feel hurt when your child calls you a name, but recognizing the real cause of the behavior can help you handle the situation calmly.;
, Give yourself a minute to calm down before you address your child’s name-calling. Count to ten or leave the room, if you need to. Never discipline your child when you’re angry.If you try to discipline your child while you’re angry, you’ll probably just take your feelings out on them, which can be harmful for both of you.

, Show your child that you’re in control of the situation by keeping your tone and your body language neutral. Avoid raising your voice, even if you’re upset."
"
Address the name-calling.,
Acknowledge your child’s emotions.,
Explain why name-calling is wrong.,
Help your child express their emotions constructively.,
Use positive reinforcement.",How to Respond when Your Preschooler Calls You Names2," Without raising your voice or overreacting, tell your child that calling names is not acceptable. Don’t try to ignore the incident or let it slide, even if you’re busy. Draw a clear boundary so your child knows the behavior is not OK.Don’t laugh or act shocked, even if your child calls you something surprising or funny. Your child wants a reaction from you. If you give it to them, they may continue calling you names in the future.
Say something like, “Toby, we do not call each other stupid in this house.”

, Look past the name-calling to see what’s really going on with your child. Consider whether they are feeling disappointed, angry, or overtired. Show your child that you’re on their side by empathizing with them.You could say, “I know you’re sad that we have to go home now. You were having fun at the playground, weren’t you?”

, Tell your child how you feel when they call you names. Help them develop their empathy by reminding them of a time when someone else hurt their feelings by calling them a name.For instance, say, “I feel sad when you say things like that to me. Do you remember when Ellie called you names last week? You felt sad then, too.”

, Give your child some new ideas for how they can cope with strong feelings. Encourage them to name what they’re feeling or to blow off steam by doing another activity.For example, you could say, “It’s okay to tell me that you’re feeling really mad at me right now. If you’re too mad to talk, you can go into your room and play with your trains until you calm down.”

, Don’t just pay attention to your child’s name-calling – notice their good behavior, too. When your child expresses their emotions appropriately, praise them and tell them what you like about their behavior.For instance, say, “I’m proud of you for telling me how you feel. That was very grown-up of you.”

"
"
Avoid calling names.,
Model good conflict resolution skills.,
Show your child how to handle strong feelings.",How to Respond when Your Preschooler Calls You Names3," Ask yourself whether you ever call other people names. If you do, work on breaking the habit. If you call your child, other family members, or even strangers names, your child will learn that name-calling is an appropriate way to vent frustration, and they’ll be confused when you tell them to stop.If you accidentally let an unkind name slip, call out your own behavior and apologize. Say, “I shouldn’t have said that, even though I’m upset right now. I’m sorry.”

, When you have a conflict with someone, be mindful about how you resolve it. Be proactive about finding a solution, and be willing to compromise. Show your child how to come to an agreement without getting angry or resorting to insults.If you have a particularly good teachable moment in one of your interactions, talk about it with your child afterwards.
For instance, say something like, “Did you notice how your older sister and I talked to each other earlier? We had a disagreement, but we didn’t get mad or call each other names.”

, Use your own emotions to teach your child healthy coping strategies. When you feel down about something, describe your negative emotions, and explain what you’re going to do about them. Invite your child to help you come up with ideas for handling your feelings.For instance, say, “I’m feeling upset that the refrigerator broke, so I’m going to step outside for a minute to calm down. When I come back, maybe we can talk about some other good things to do when we’re upset.”

Explain your concerns.,
Avoid ever introducing a television into your home, if possible.,
Set a good example.,
Start by removing the television from your child’s room, if there is one.,
Go cold turkey.For some families, starting a no-TV lifestyle “cold turkey” (immediately cutting out all TV without a period of gradual reduction) is too difficult.,
Reduce the amount of time a child spends watching television.,
Establish “screen-free” zones and times.,
Make sure the child has access to non-electronic media and entertainment.,
Plan family and group activities.,
Plan individual activities.,
Exercise.,
Let your child direct activities.",How to Raise No TV Children," The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under two do not watch TV at all, and that all other children have no more than one or two hours of screen time per day.Explain to your children that you are trying to do what is best for them, and to encourage healthy habits.;
, It can be much easier to raise children with a “no TV” policy if they have never experienced having a television at home.While there will still be temptations to watch TV in other locations, you will start strong by keeping it out of your home.

, If you want to raise a no-TV child, then you will have to model good behavior.Whether you completely eliminate television from your child's life or simply restrict the amount they watch, set your own viewing policy to match the same standards that you set for your child. Showing a good example for your children will make it more likely that they adopt the no-TV lifestyle.

, Studies show that having televisions in childrens' room can have a detrimental impact on their health and academic success.If you are trying to ease your children off of television, you can begin by taking them out of their rooms; the children could still watch some TV in another room, but this step will already reduce screen time significantly.

, For others, however, the quickest method will be the easiest. If you want to try going cold turkey, talk to your family ahead of time about the change. Set a date to begin the no-TV life, and stick to it.


Whether you go cold turkey or make a gradual change, the goal should be to eliminate TV and offer your child more enriching alternatives.

, Studies show that there can be some benefits to watching some amount of television in certain cases. For instance, children that watched certain enriching programs have slightly larger vocabularies, according to some research.Thus, you might decide not to cut out all television right away, but to gradually reduce the amount of time the child is allowed to watch TV.


For instance, try reducing the amount of TV your child is permitted to watch by one hour per week, until it is zero or almost zero.
You can also suggest that the whole family watches a movie on television together on the weekend, but ban TV at night during the week.
Similarly, you might have a rule that no television is permitted until the child completes all homework or chores.If you do watch some TV together, talk about it afterwards. This helps increase comprehension, raise vocabulary, and generally promote bonding.

, If you have not immediately removed all televisions from your household, you can start by deeming certain areas or times to be “screen-free.”For instance, you can establish a rule against watching television at mealtimes, and remove televisions from areas where other activities take place, such as kitchens, dining rooms, or game rooms.

, Books, newspapers, games, art supplies, and other items can be immersive, entertaining, and beneficial to a child. Make sure that your child has plenty of access to these more enriching alternatives to television., There are many, many wonderful opportunities to spend time time together that don’t involve television. You can help your child thrive without TV if you are proactive and plan alternative, group activities ahead of time—especially if you are switching from a lifestyle involving lots of TV viewing to a no-TV one. Good choices include:Game nights (the whole family can get together to play a favorite board game)
Reading out loud
Crafting
Playing music
Visits to the library, zoo, a museum, a park, or other favorite place
Playing outside with other kids in the neighborhood
Extracurricular activities (sports, dance, outdoors, crafts, etc.; these are great ways for your child to connect with other children, build confidence and skill, and avoid screen time)

, There are all kinds of benefits to spending no-TV time together as a family. Children also develop well when they are given time to spend by themselves. Children can benefit from having time to immerse themselves in free reading, drawing or coloring, and other activities.Sometimes, you can take a combined approach. For instance, an entire family can read silently together, each person immersed in a book. That way, while everyone is together, they also get to act individually. This sets a good example for your child, and makes great use of no-TV time.

, There is a link between obesity and watching large amounts of television, so one of the most beneficial ways to use your and your child’s time instead of watching television is to exercise. Good activities include:


Games such as tag and hide-and-seek
Dancing
A family walk or hike
Bicycling
Swimming
Sports (baseball, basketball, etc.)

, If your children feels like they have a say in planning the no-TV life, it can be empowering and lead to success. Talk to your children about activities that they might like to try instead of watching TV, and be supportive of the ideas. Set aside time during the week to do the activities your child wants the family to try.


Have fun trying out your child’s ideas, no matter what they are: building a pillow fort, having a tea party, playing with blocks and action figures, etc.

Trust your children, and respect their right to decide on their own.",How to Raise Children Who Think for Themselves," You can teach your children to think for themselves by showing them at every possible opportunity how you make decisions. Stand behind the choices you make, and express your reasons for making them, which will help them understand why you chose the way you did.;
, Unobstructed play is crucial to raising children to think for themselves and for the children's development because it forces them to decide what to play with and how. These first decisions are building blocks for independent thinking.

, Ask them to pick between 2 or 3 outfits, and no matter what they choose, let them wear it. As you build up their confidence with these smaller decisions, ease in to larger choices, such as what to have for dinner, or ask their input on where to go for vacation.

, This is a form of second guessing and may make your children feel badly about their decision. It may also cause them to be insecure about the next decision they need to make.

, If they hear your thoughts or advice, they may feel as if they need someone else to tell them what to think or feel. Instead, ask them what they think about the situation, and what they believe the choices are. Encourage them to talk about what decision they want to make and why.

, Helping them understand why rules are in place will encourage children to decide to follow them.

, Make sure to keep your message short and simple. In 2 or 3 sentences only, inform them which actions you are disappointed with and why, and what the consequences are. Use simple wording whenever possible to make it easier for your children to concentrate on their actions.

, Refrain from telling them they are bad or wrong, and use phrases like ""your behavior is out of line"" instead. This prevents children from feeling personally attacked, and helps them understand that it's their actions you are unhappy with, not them.

, Your children need to learn that there are consequences for their actions and that making the wrong choice will lead to an appropriate punishment.

, Using rewards or threats to influence their decisions will send a message that they aren't capable of making good choices without external incentives.

, Once you've laid the groundwork, give them room to actually make choices, and don't interfere unless there is imminent danger. They'll make good and bad decisions along the way, but in order to get better at the process, they need to have the freedom to do so.

Encourage your kids to figure it out themselves.,
Don’t force the issue.,
Treat Santa as an imaginative game.,
Give some context.,
Strike a balance.,
Dress up as Santa at home.,
Don’t tell other people’s children.",How to Raise Children Not to Believe in Santa Claus," Santa Claus can be a tricky subject for parents of young children. Often you will feel torn between not wanting to lie to your kids, and not wanting to break the spell of Santa Claus and his flying reindeer. Once your kids start to get curious they will probably ask you lots of questions about Santa. One way to deal with the questions which encourages the kids to think about it is to turn the questions back on them.If your daughter asks you if Santa is real, say “what do you think?” and ask her why she thinks what she does.
If she pushes you for an answer you can subtly dodge it, while encouraging her to think critically. Say something like “well, I’ve never seen Santa, and don’t really believe in things I haven’t seen.”
You could also encourage her to think about some of the implausible parts of story, such as visiting every house in one night, and the flying reindeer.
Doing this can prompt her to come to her own conclusion as part of growing up naturally.;
, Encouraging your kids to come up with the truth themselves avoids a scenario in which you bluntly break the magic of Santa Claus. Always try to encourage questions rather than just presenting answers, but if you are asked outright you don’t have to lie. Depending on your child you might think it best just to be straightforward and honest.


If asked, you could just say “No, Santa Claus isn’t real. He’s part of the myth and story of the holidays.”
You can explain that there isn’t a man with a beard that comes down the chimney to give you presents, but that people who love and care for each other give each other gifts.

, You can try to have your children associate Santa Claus with other imaginary characters in games and plays. You can refer to Santa “from the Christmas stories” to connect Santa with other fictional characters. Your children will begin to piece things together and develop their understanding that Santa is part of an imaginative world and not a real one.


You can associate Santa with characters that your child may be less likely to believe in, such as the Tooth Fairy or the Easter Bunny.Your kids can enjoy a fantasy story while understanding that it is not real.

, It can be helpful to provide some context for the Santa stories to help you to explain their persistence. You could explain the story of St Nicholas who gave to poor and looked after children many centuries ago, and say that these stories develop and change over time.You could set them a task to find out about the stories and ask them to unravel the mystery themselves.

, While you might think it’s important not to lie to your children, you should take care to strike a balance and allow them to fully enjoy all the festivities of the holidays. Your daughter might understand that Santa is not real, but will still want to visit the Santa in the Mall with her friends, or leave out some cookies and carrots for Santa and the reindeer.


Kids love to pretend, so you shouldn’t assume that they really believe Santa Claus is real if they want to participate in the different activities.It can be hard to escape Santa in the holidays with all the films, decorations and pictures, but you can limit the amount of Santa in your own home.

, One way to keep Santa present, but to demonstrate to your kids that he is not a real person, is to have one of the parents dress up as Santa at home. Your child will certainly know that this is their Mom or Dad, and you can use this as a way to play together and associate Santa with other fictional characters.


Dressing up can help you make Santa into a game for your kids.
You can create stories involving Santa teaming up with all sorts of other fictional characters.

, You might think it’s wrong to lie to your kids about Santa Claus, but you need to remember that each family is different and it’s not up to you to decide when someone else’s kids learn the truth. You may find yourself in some awkward situations if one of your child’s friends asks you about Santa Claus, but you should divert them back to their own parents.Once your kid knows the truth, be sure to explain to them that they shouldn’t go around telling all their friends.
Try to explain that other kids believe in Santa and your child shouldn’t break the spell for them.
Say “you figured out that Santa wasn’t real, and you should let your friends do the same.”

Never use disposables.,
Try using cloth diapers instead; they aren't as time consuming as you might think, and you'll save a lot of money if you buy a complete set worth about $400.,
Alternatively, you can use Elimination Communication (infant potty training), which will considerably lower your usage of either cloth or disposable diapers.

,
Nurse, if at all possible.,
When they've been weaned off of milk, give them food that's wholesome and nutritious, but also uses very simple ingredients.,
Only purchase new items if there is no other option.,
Get a second-hand crib.,
Look on eBay if you have no other choice.,
Acknowledge the fact that babies and toddlers need to play constantly as part of their early development.,
Be realistic when deciding upon toys.,
A small sheet mirror stuck to the side of a crib lets a baby see its own face, which at this point is more fascinating than anything else in their lives.

,
Musical toys can also be made from simple everyday items.",How to Raise an Eco Friendly Child1," They take 500 years to decompose and are responsible for over 4 million tons of landfill waste each year in the U.S alone.;
, Disposables, on the other hand, cost $15 a week, so in over 3 years, at least $2500 will go to waste as well.

,, As far as good environmental practice goes, breast milk is definitely best. If you want to give your baby milk, you'll want to get it from the most local source.


Most mothers don't think they have the time to breastfeed on a regular basis, but they can express milk for later consumption, and once you get the hang of the process it shouldn't take any more time than it would take to make up the powdered formula, heating it up, and sterilizing the bottles when done (a process which also uses lots of energy).

, Making the food up from scratch whether it's mushy or solid is the best way to control a child's consumption of artificial additives.

, When purchasing the crib, dresser, and other furnishings for your baby's room, keep in mind that most people will buy everything brand new, but you don't need to do this.

, You can go to a local charity store. Another option is to contact a friend whose baby has just outgrown their crib and ask whether you can have theirs; it hasn't seen a great deal of action, after all.

, Search for items that are close to where you live so if you have to collect them personally, you won't be going through a full tank of gas on the journey there and back.

, The toys to offer them today are far more extravagant than they were just 20 years ago, to the point where they've become power-draining commodities themselves.

, They don't need fancy toys to be entertained. A simple game of patty cake or some time with the chunky soft building blocks is enough to keep a baby happy, and it increases parental bonds as well.

,, A few pots, pans, and some wooden spoons will make a nice little drum set; just one example of how babies learn things through play.

, Dairy products such as milk have also got convincing versions made with processed soy beans. While the taste of the fake cheese may leave something to be desired, you'd be surprised how many different plant materials can be turned into more ecological sources of calcium.

, The Coca-Cola Corporation robs people in distant nations of the water that runs right beneath their feet, so it's a huge moral decision to give it up as well.

, Fruit juices may seem like a good alternative to pop, but they have their own share of faults. They take huge amounts of water and energy to be produced, and are full of very harmful natural sugars. Your best bet is to stick to good old-fashioned tap water.

,


A damp flannel should be sufficient to wash a child's face if they've stained it with food or outside dirt.
If they're so dirty they must have a proper wash-up, it's a tie between a 5-minute shower or a shallow bath. A power shower uses up more water than a full tub in just a few minutes, so set the head to a low-flow setting.

, If you want to be really picky, then don't use them if there's no marking saying that the product has not been tested on animals.

, Also encourage them to only flush the toilet when it's absolutely necessary.

, Some may need more store-bought items, some eat more meat, etc.


A cat might have a smaller diet and therefore fewer emissions. They are notorious back yard predators that kill dozens of birds, mice, and other mammals and reptiles in their 20+ year lifespans.
A rabbit or a turtle is a greener alternative to the latter animals, as they're vegetarian and can spend most of their time in the yard if supervised. However, if a rabbit doesn't have a strong hutch it faces threats from predatory mammals and birds, and turtles can't sustain themselves outside in the winter months.

, The most environmentally-friendly pet (post-manufacturing and shipping) is a stuffed one. A teddy bear needs no food or water, no walks, and no expensive vet bills.

, 90% of all domestic waste can be recycling, but only about 20% of it currently is, with the rest ending up rotting in landfills or turned into energy at an incineration plant and lost forever.


Recycling just one steel or aluminum can will save enough power to keep a plasma TV on for up to half an hour, and power a filament light bulb for over an hour so collecting waste gives you the potential to offset nearly all your household emissions.

,, Let your child put some of the waste in themselves, even if it means giving them a leg-up.

,, You may be able to start a campaign that will cause them to change their ways for the better, but only if you try to make an effort. Please ask the administrators of the school first before starting a campaign, though; you may end up wasting resources for no reason when all you had to do was ask.

, Examples could be arts and crafts, taking up a musical instrument (even electric keyboards would suffice over TV), or just play through imagination.

,, Turn off computer monitors if they're not being used or put on standby or to hibernation mode and turn off a TV that won't be watched for more than 5 minutes.

, 99.9% of the time it probably is, but TV is an incredible tool that if used correctly can actually educate and enthrall in equal measure. A prime example of this are Nat Geo and the Discovery networks, which are brimming with eye-opening documentaries and may even have programming that relates to your green lifestyle.

, Wooden bricks and train sets are great toys for boys, and girls will enjoy a knitted or embroidered doll instead of a Barbie or Bratz.]

A battery-free toy doesn't need to be inanimate; clockwork or wind-up technology has been used to make trains, cars, racing horses and more; you just have to know where to look.

, Most girls dress up as fairies, queens, and gentle animals like cows and horses. Boys, meanwhile, prefer other fantastical things like superheros, dragons, robots, and cowboys.

, Outside there are a load of new possibilities. A sandbox full of castle-building tools can provide hours of fun for children aged 6 and under.

, Make sure you only use scrap paper, plus by drawing on both sides, you make it last twice as long.

Take the birthday boy or girl out somewhere they enjoy such as a theme park or the zoo, that way the things they did have more significance than the gifts they're given.,
Ask Santa to bring your children presents in a reusable gift bag rather than poor-quality wrapping paper.

,
Be prudent on the presents.,
Encourage Christmas cards and decorations to be homemade.,
Try making a vegetarian or vegan alternative to the Yule turkey.

,
Use a real Christmas tree instead of an artificial ""fake fir"".,
Decorate the tree with natural or homemade decorations such as pine cones, a cardboard angel, and red berries.

,
Buy a plastic Christmas tree!

,
Rather than wasting chicken eggs for this special occasion, find some large smooth stones that resemble eggs.,
Hide the eggs as part of an Easter egg hunt or roll them down the hill to commemorate the stone of Jesus Christ's tomb being rolled away to let him live again.

,
Be conservative when making the costumes.,
Give out healthier sweets like packets of raisins or apples to visitors, and only if you feel they deserve a treat.

,
Don't buy the cards- make them!,
Try incorporating the story of St. Valentine into the day.,
Instead of buying something for your lover, you could give them something more significant.",How to Raise an Eco Friendly Child3,"


There's no shame in taking them out for a big meal in a restaurant or a to play laser tag, it's one of the few times in the year that is really special to them.

,, Presents should need no batteries and minimal wall socket power if any to operate. Eco-conservation gifts such as packets of seeds or a book printed on sustainably-sourced paper will keep children environmentally conscious even at the most lavish and self-indulgent time of the year. Kids will also like it!

, There's more sincerity in a card from a family member and not a big corporation.

,, While the latter can be used multiple times, a real tree that still has it's roots can be planted back into the ground until next year. When it rots away it can be broken up and biodegraded naturally.

,,, Decorate them however you like, as long as it's with natural paints.

,, It doesn't take much to make a good costume. All you need is a white sheet to be a ghost, but you can be more creative than that if you put your mind to it.

,, Just like Christmas cards, the best ones are homemade by one Valentine to give to another.

, It'll give the day a greater sense of purpose.

, Planting a flowering shrub or tree with pink blossoms is one example, but you must try to think outside the box to impress people.

Help children learn about nature.,
Talk about purpose.,
Be available.,
Help them with homework, compromising, being shy, etc.,
Teach them the right things to do in any situation.,
Get them into the best education courses/classes.",How to Raise Children Successfullly," Teaching children to love and not fear nature is a vital part of teaching children that this a larger world than their bedroom and games station. It will give them the ability to feel a connection with something other than the house, school and local park. Pack a couple sandwiches, take the kids into the woods and hike a deer trail through the woods. As you go:


Let the kids ask questions. Tell them the answers to their questions if you know, or several answers.
Tell them stories. Make up a funny story or so maybe even with some life lessons.
Keep walking and talking. Take a walk with them and talk and share a good conversation about school, friends, just anything you'd like.
Explore. Walk all around a small forest/creek, and play in the leaves or walk on bridged logs. Take photos of strange trees, or put the leaves into a nice picture.
Wear them out. This would be by having them use a lot of energy during the day, and then around bedtime they should sleep easily and well.;
, It is important that you consider first what purpose means for you before raising this issue with your children. When you have a good idea of it for yourself, start a conversation with them about the concept of purpose and why you think it matters in life to have purpose. Ask them what they consider a good purpose might be for their lives.

, It is important to let children know that you're willing to listen to them whatever has happened. Don't badger, don't scold, just be receptive and available. They'll come to you if you've taken the time to build trust. Just always be there when your children need you.

, It's important that they can understand what they're taught in school, and that they know how to make a tough decision, and problem solve. Compromising is a great way to do that, but not the only way. Just help them and care about the problems they're facing in life, it's for the best to just help out with a dispute among friends, with dealing with bullying, with knowing if they're friends are good friends, or that they even have friends, and so on. Any issues in a child's everyday life can be helped with the parents.

, When they grow up, they'll have to be independently away from parents, and into the harsh world of today. They'll meet so many mean-spirited people that without a guide(parent) that it can become hard to cope with them. If you teach them the right path in life, they'll know how to handle anything. If the child would meet someone really mean,then tell them what would be best to do with them.

, For example, if the child/children do really well in math, then it could be best to have them in a high or the highest math class in their grade. Although, they could be really good in math, but they might not really like math. So, they should be taught to be excited about math for every class, and to have a fun time, but still manage their assignments and work. It all depends on the situation, but try to help them succeed in every class/course, and make sure they do their best, even if they're not good in a subject.

Live by example.,
Listen to your children, what they say, and feel.,
Watch what they pay attention to the most.,
Show interest by investing time and money.,
Ask them to meditate (think, ponder, use their imagination) on what they would like to become or be one day.,
Never, never, never, tell you child they can't do something.,
Please, please, please, don't live through your child, by living out your dreams.,
Never pass down ignorance or wrong information from previous generations.,
Take care what you tell your kids.,
Watch their company.,
Train your children the right way and allow them to make mistakes.",How to Raise Ambitious and Caring Children," Become a mentor to your own child. Even if you spend much of your time out of the home. Communication is a big issue. There are many ways to communicate with them. You can use the computer (chat with them), text (cellphone, computer), facebook, Myspace, by letters and just the regular telephone. Many times your words shape their beliefs. You can make a negative or positive impact on them. You have to speak positive to your child. Praise them for the little that they achieve, instead of focusing on their weaknesses. Please don't show differences. Yes, we know that each child is different. They have different personalities and needs. Focus on their needs. One child may have a more aggressive personality than the other. One might be more meek than the other. In life these characters traits play their part. We are all made to be different.;
, Allow them to express themselves. They are people with feelings, emotions, and thoughts. They have good or bad days just like adults. Listen to what they are interested in the most. Ask questions about what they like.

, Do they have certain skills, abilities, hobbies or interests. Example: Favorite TV shows, games, sports, writing, arts, crafts, computers, sketches, fashion, hair, etc.

, If you don't have the money, there are many resources out there today. The library has a wealth of information, internet, and schools. There is no excuse for a child to not achieve, study, or research any field.

, Find the resources and prepare while they are early.

, Sure, we can't be everything. But if they have the will and determination, they can achieve anything. One theory is: determination + preparation + opportunity = success.

, They were created as an individual being. They have their own ambitions, dreams, and desires. It is never to late to start on your dreams. The founder of KFC did, and he was in his 60's when he started. What is your excuse?

, If you found out that it was wrong or you were misguided, just remind yourself to never teach it to your children.

, Children are like sponges, they soak up everything. You never know if you are raising an astronaut, engineer, geologist, president, artist, etc.

, You are the parent, not their little friend. No, don't get me wrong. Allow your children to talk to your and come to your as a friend. When it comes to disciplining them and protecting them from the wrong crowd, that's when you parent. They know the difference.

, Please don't rule with an iron fist. Know when to correct and know when to listen. Weigh your options when you discipline them, maybe they just need a listening ear. Their actions might be them lashing out about a problem at school, etc.

Influence them from an early age.,
Introduce your child to age-appropriate books.,
Let them inhale their surroundings.,
Encourage them to plan ahead.,
Teach them about failure.,
Teach them about success as well as failure.,
Teach them about money.,
Support your child.,
Allow them their dreams.,
Surround them with the good.",How to Raise a Strong and Independent Child," Teach them life's lessons early on. Perhaps you should introduce them to people like Mahatma Gandhi, Robert Louis Stevenson, Joan of Arc, Einstein, Napoleon Bonaparte, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Winston Churchill and anyone else you find inspiring. Explain why they are an important figure in the history of mankind in an easy way so they remember and understand. If you want, you can start of in a simple approach by teaching them about the brains behind their favorite TV show. Say something like, ""You like watching this show, don't you, Harry? Well, the people who made it are very clever. They listened to their teachers and used their imagination. Do you want to be like them?"" This way is fun and easy.;
, Start off giving them books (non-fiction and fiction are both good) that are suitable to their age, and then allow them to read slightly harder books. The books can be about anything to start off with, but as they grow older, give them books that will teach them something. Always keep in mind what their interests are and make sure to pick out books on those subjects. If they enjoy drawing, give them a children's book on famous painters. Don't fill their whole bookshelf with educational books though, buy them fiction suitable for their age, after all, they're still children. Even these sort of books can grow their imagination!

, To make this process fun, take them on regular outings and let them take in what they see. It can be a park, a theme park, a foreign market, a farm, a museum, and more. If they know how to write, encourage them carry a notebook and write about any interesting sights, smells and sounds they experience. Consider asking them to use this information to write a story or poem.

, As your child gets older, (especially when they reach middle school and high school) ask them what career they would like to pursue for a living. At a more mature age, they will give an answer with reasoning, whereas a child of five may say a 'fireman' just because it sounds fun. Give them more information on their dream career, but be sure to state the pros and cons of the job.

, Tell your child that failure is not something to be ashamed of--making mistakes is the start of learning. For example, the radio wasn't invented in one day, the inventor had to think, scrap and repeat his ideas; and millionaires weren't born with ten-million dollars in their pocket, they had to make mistakes and yes, sometimes they failed. If your child is a teenager, get them to read books about how famous people came to be. Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance is recommended, it shows that the character failed sometimes, but he made some of the biggest companies: Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and obviously, his biggest achievement, PayPal.

, Tell them that success is what drives you further, but you have to manage it wisely. For example, Charlotte Brontë was just another Bradfordian girl who wanted to escape her difficult childhood through her writing, but she managed to become one of the biggest and most successful British writers of her time with Jane Eyre; and the same with Emily Brontë, her sister, who wrote Wuthering Heights. The Industrial Revolution which struck Victorian Britain with such strength is the base of all electronics. If one clever Victorian hadn't thought of the idea of a gadget, iPhones, computers, cars and machines would not exist.

, Teach your child that being greedy for money is wrong, but you should have enough to be a stable adult. This is where mathematics comes in. Numeracy is a 'must do' subject, so advance on what they learn in school and teach them more!

, Support them through childhood, adulthood and everything else they may come across. Never underestimate them-they are capable of doing good things.

, Although it's unrealistic for a child to dream of becoming a princess, don't crush their dreams while their young. It may take a few years, but it's far better for a child to let go of a dream that isn't hurting anyone than for the dream to be crushed, even if it's done with good intent. If it seems like a realistic dream, like dreaming to be a doctor one day, help your child in the process and teach them everything they need to know.

, Make sure they are surrounded by people who love and care for them, so they are not led to bad influences. Obviously bad people will cross your child's path, but make sure that whenever you can, your child is encased in good vibes.

Shower your wild child with love and affection.,
Know when to deck your wild child out in new swag (Get a new pot).,
Record that Kodak moment.",How to Raise a Wild Child Plant," Buying a plant is like adopting a young kid. While they’ll eventually adapt to your conditions, you have to respect where he or she came from, and understand their individual demands. Your Ardisia plant, also called the Coral Berry, is native to southern China and Indonesia. As a tropical plant, it’s quite sensitive to frost, so make sure you keep it inside during the winter until the first few weeks of spring. When your plant has fully grown (which may take a couple months), white petals will bloom from late spring into the summer, which will soon be followed by a ring of red berries that will last until Christmas.;
, Your Wild Child needs sunlight like a baby needs breast milk. Give them too much, and you're bound to see some undesired results. The Coral Berry plant only needs indirect sunlight, so make sure that it's a few feet from the window.

, It’s important to know how thirsty your plant is. Luckily for you, your Wild Child isn’t that needy. The Ardisia plant needs roughly one cup of water a week, but it's advisable to water him or her when their soil begins losing its moisture to the touch.

, Talk to them, tickle their leaves, and give them a big hug every once in a while.

, Over the next few months, your plant will grow out of its old clothes and will need a new getup. Let the next pot you buy be the next size up, and deck it out with items that fit your Wild Child’s personality. Is he or she chill and sedentary? Or one of those twerking in the breeze types?

, Remember to document your memories and share them.

Provide familiar items.,
Shield your baby from light.,
Remove problematic items at sleep time.,
Keep to your normal sleep schedule.,
Continue your pre-sleep routine.,
Phase your baby into a new schedule, if you must.",How to Get Your Baby to Sleep Anywhere," White noise is repetitive background noise used to drown out disruptive sounds and to put people at ease.Thus, white noise is a great tool to help get your baby to sleep anywhere.

White noise is great because the same sounds can be played just about anywhere. To best use white noise, use it at home so it becomes part of your baby’s sleep routine. Then, when you travel, it’ll be easier for you to replicate your home environment.
White noise comes in several different variations. For instance, you can play static, the sound of a rainstorm, wind, a crashing surf, and many more.
You can play white noise on cell phones, alarm clocks, or your laptop.;
, Music is a great way to put your baby to ease before bed. If you choose soothing music, you’ll not only put your baby at ease, but you’ll be better able to reproduce your home environment.

Like white noise, try to incorporate music into your baby’s sleep routine. For example, play the same soothing song to your baby at bedtime. Soft, repetitive songs are the best to helping them fall asleep.Avoid introducing new songs to your baby if you are traveling or doing something that disturbs their sleep routine.
Try singing to your baby.

If possible, close doors or windows so your baby does not hear the sounds of the home or street at bedtime.
Turn off the television or other electronics that make noise while your baby is trying to sleep.
Think about using noise cancelling baby headphones if you are in a noisy environment., To get your baby to sleep anywhere, you’ll have to have several basic items. Without these items, your baby will likely be uncomfortable and won’t be able to sleep. Make sure you have the following,

A place for your baby to sleep, like a crib, bassinet, sleeper, rocker, or pack-and-play.
A warm outfit for your baby to sleep in, if you’re in a cold environment. Consider sleepers, sleep sacks, or wearable blankets.
Avoid putting soft bedding like pillows, blankets, and stuffed animals in a crib or other sleeping environment with a baby under 12 months old. These items could increase the chance of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)., Familiarity is one of the most important things in getting a baby to sleep anywhere. By having items the baby knows, they’ll feel more comfortable and will be put at ease. In the end, they’ll fall asleep easier even in a strange environment. Make sure to have:

Sheets you use on a regular basis.
Familiar stuffed animals. However, don’t leave many – if any – of these in your baby’s sleep environment if you are not watching them. Do not put stuffed animals, blankets, or pillows in the crib if they are under 12 months of age.
A mobile. You can get mobiles for cribs, bassinets, or other sleep environments., Studies have shown that light interferes with the human’s ability to sleep soundly. Just as this is true for you, it is also true for your baby. Thus, take steps to limit the amount of light your baby is exposed to during sleep time or while you are getting them ready to sleep.

Dim lights. For example, if you’re on an airplane, turn your overhead light off and ask your neighbor to do the same, if possible.
Use shades designed to shade babies from light.
Drape a light breathable fabric over your baby’s bassinet.
Find a shady spot, if you’re outside., There are a wide variety of things that could be around your baby at sleep time that might interfere with their ability to sleep. These items may not only distract your baby, but create noises that stop them from falling to sleep. Some items include:

Toys
Pacifiers
Items that make noises that could go off suddenly or be accidentally triggered, Wherever you go, you should stick as closely to your baby’s sleep schedule. Deviation will make it harder for your baby to sleep. Thus:

Provide your baby with normal nap time. If your baby usually naps at 10 am or 2 pm, make sure they get their naps.
If you usually put your baby to bed at 7pm, continue to do so. This way, they’ll be able to stay on their nap schedule.
You may want to keep a nap chart to see when they are sleeping and for how long. This can help you keep track of whether or not your baby is getting enough sleep.

, Just because you’re not at home does not mean you should discontinue important aspects of your baby’s sleep routine. Ultimately, the best way to get your baby to sleep is to continue as many normal activities as you can before bedtime. These activities may include:

Reading books
Singing songs
Nursing
Putting your baby into a sleep suitTurning down the lights

, If traveling extensively, moving from one timezone to another, or having a significant life change that impacts your family, try to phase your child into a new schedule. Ultimately, your baby will adjust much better to incremental changes to their schedule than to a big shift.

If you’re moving into a different time zone with a one hour difference, try to adjust them to the new time zone over the course of a week or two. For example, change your baby’s sleep schedule by 15 minutes every week.
If you’re going to be traveling a lot, try to get your baby used to traveling by taking them out in the car or in public more often. For instance, set aside time to take your baby to the mall or to another crowded area."

Keep twins on the same sleep schedule.,
Feed twins at the same time, even it means waking up one twin.,
Avoid waking a baby too much, even during a feeding.,
Record your schedule.,
Encourage older children to rest.",How to Get Your Twins to Actually Take a Nap1," To start, you want to make sure your twins are on roughly the same sleep schedule. If your twins are used to napping around the same time, this decreases the likelihood one twin will disturb the other's rest. This will also make things easier on you. You do not want to constantly be tending to one baby or the other.Try to put your twins to bed at the same time each night. In the morning, make sure they're also up around the same time. On occasion, this may mean waking one twin up.
Schedule nap times around the same time as well. How often your children need to nap varies by age. Babies under 6 months should nap on and off throughout the day, getting about 16 to 20 hours of total sleep. From 6 to 12 months, babies usually require two daytime naps totally 3 to 4 hours. Toddlers usually need one daytime nap of one to two hours. Children ages 3 to 5 may occasionally want an afternoon nap, although it's less necessary at this point.;
, During the night, twins will often need nighttime feedings. Often, one twin will wake you up crying. Even if the other twin sleeps through the sibling's crying, wake and feed the other twin. While you may dislike the idea of waking a sleeping baby, you need to get rest yourself. You do not want to be awakened in another 20 minutes to feed the other baby., Keep the lights dim as you're feeding your baby. Do not handle the baby more than you need to. Simply do the feeding and put the baby back to sleep.If your child is at least 9 months old, you can put a toy or blanket in the crib after feeding.

In general, babies fall asleep easier if they nap around the same time each day.When you first bring your twins home, life can be especially chaotic. However, routine is important to sleep cycle and twins will sleep more easily if they're going to sleep and napping around the same time each day.Keep a journal where you jot down when the babies fall asleep each night, when they get up in the morning, and what times they're napping.
Consider recording details that can help you improve your schedule. Track the twins moods before naps. If they seemed energetic, you may be scheduling a nap at the wrong time of day. Try moving your nap back half an hour the following day and see if the twins fall asleep easier.

, If your twins are 3 or older, they may have less of a need for naps. Some days, an older child may claim not to be tired. You can try to encourage rest time over nap time, as rest in the afternoon is still vital to a young child's wellbeing.


Compromise. Try to get the twins to lie down in a dark room and listen to some gentle music. Encourage them to rest and avoid playing with their toys.Your twins may not actually fall asleep during this time. However, the physical rest can be beneficial on its own. As children get older, they have less need for nap time. Do not worry if twins older than 3 years do not nap every day."

Place twins in a safe sleeping position.,
Place smaller twins in a single cot.,
Switch the babies to separate cribs as they get older.,
Have a nap time ritual.,
Swaddle babies.,
Keep the bedroom dark.",How to Get Your Twins to Actually Take a Nap2," Your babies will rub their eyes, droop their eyelids, and behave in a fussy fashion when they're getting tired. Put them to bed when they first begin to show signs of drowsiness. The longer you wait, the fussier and more frustrated they'll get. A crabby, stressed attitude can make it harder for the twins to sleep., To make sure your twins sleep safely, place them in a safe position when putting them down for a nap. Clear the crib of blankets, toys, and other soft items. Make sure you put the twins down on their backs to sleep., When twins are very young, you may want to place them in a single cot. This saves space, and may also help your twins sleep. They can soothe one another, regulate each other's body temperatures, and it can help to get them on the same sleep schedule.You should follow the same sleeping safety guidelines you would use when placing a single baby in a crib. Clear the crib of items and place the twins on their backs. If you choose to separate your twins, use a crib divider sold for this purpose. Do not use a blanket or other household item.The twins faces should be facing one another, with their feet at opposite ends of the crib., As your twins get older and bigger, they'll be unable to share a single crib. The crib will get crowded, for one, and twins will move around more in their sleep, increasing the risk for one twin hurting another. After a few months, put the twins in separate cribs.


It's recommended twins sleep in the same bed, with their cribs facing each other. This way, they can provide each other comfort and support during the night.However, one twin may disturb another. If one baby seems to sleep through the night, while the other fusses a lot, you may want to consider separate rooms.You may be able to tell which twin is the lighter sleeper based on behavior. If one twin is crying loudly when you enter the room, while the other is only lightly fussing, the crying twin may have been awake longer. This indicates he's the lighter sleeper of the two.

, Like adults, babies and children respond well to ritual. Engaging in a calming activity just before nap time can signal to a child that now is the time for rest. Just before you put the twins down for a nap, engage in a relaxing ritual.


Pick something that will encourage your twins to sleep. Try a warm bath, a bedtime story, singing, or quiet talking.Be consistent with your ritual. Your twins will learn to associate a particular activity with a time for rest. This may encourage them to sleep easier during nap time.

, Swaddling babies involves wrapping them in blankets. If your twins are still infants, wrap them each in a light blanket before putting them in their cribs. This will help your twins feel safe and secure. It may encourage them to fall asleep more easily., Bright lights can stimulate brain activity, making sleep difficult. Keep the bedroom dark at night and during nap time. This can help with sleep.Always close the door behind you when leaving the twins to rest.


If your twins sometimes sleep in the living room or another room in the house, turn the lights off and draw the blinds.
Many young children are afraid of the dark. To help combat this fear, consider plugging in a dim nightlight. While even a small light can potentially cause sleep disturbances, if a child is scared or uncomfortable, this can make sleep even harder. The benefit of a small nightlight may outweigh the drawbacks.

Have someone else help with household chores.,
Keep your expectations realistic.,
Get enough sleep.,
Cut back on social obligations.",How to Get Your Twins to Actually Take a Nap3," It can be very stressful to take care of twins. Even if you maintain a strict schedule, the babies will not always sleep and eat together.

It may be difficult to keep up when caring for two children at once.Talk to other parents of twins. Ask them for advice and feedback on how to maintain their energy levels throughout the day., You cannot expect your twins to fall into the same sleep schedule right away. It will take a few weeks before twins are napping consistently and at the same time. Try to have patience. Keep on a regular schedule and, eventually, your twins will learn to nap.

, As a parent, you need to make sure you're getting enough sleep on your own end. You need to stay energetic to have the stamina necessary to care for twins. Try napping on the same schedule as your children. When you put them down for a nap, take a nap as well. If you have very young babies, napping during the day may help you make up for sleep lost during nightly feedings., When parenting twins, cut yourself some slack. When the twins are infants, especially, step back on social obligations. Do not volunteer for an event at work. If a friend comes to town to visit, do not offer to host. Your friends and colleagues will more than understand your circumstances and will not want you overexerting yourself."

Offer rewards.",How to Get a Toddler to Sleep in His or Her Own Bed," Remember that it’s easier to teach a younger child to sleep alone than it is to change an older child’s habits, so consider starting as soon as you feel ready. Ideally, though, you’ll also want to move your child to his or her own bed during a relatively peaceful and uncomplicated time – not when your schedule is crazy or when your toddler is dealing with any other major changes.


If you are traveling or moving in the near future, it’s best to wait. You won’t be able to sustain the routine during such a chaotic time, and too many changes will be overwhelming for a toddler.
If your child is sick or injured, or if he or she is dealing with other issues related to sleep (including nightmares or night terrors), it’s also best to wait until these problems subside.
If your child is in the middle of another major transition (weaning from the breast, giving up a pacifier, learning to use the toilet, or starting a day-care or preschool program), consider postponing the move to a new bed. These transitions are difficult for toddlers, and it’s not a good idea to pile them one on top of the other.;
, If you have a partner, have an honest conversation about putting an end to co-sleeping. The transition will be more successful (and much less stressful) if you approach it from a position of agreement and mutual support. Don’t try to force the issue if one partner feels strongly that it is too soon to make the change.

, Explain to your child what you expect, and present it in a happy, positive way – as an exciting change that shows how big and independent he or she is getting.

, Take your child to purchase bedding, and consider allowing him or her to choose a special new toy or stuffed animal with whom to share the bed.

, Make sure your toddler uses his or her own bed at nap time. He will learn to associate it with sleep at a less stressful time.

, If you have already established a regular bedtime routine – for example, your toddler has a bath, puts on pajamas, eats a snack, gets a bedtime story, brushes his or her teeth, and then goes to bed – keep every part of the routine in place except for where he or she sleeps. That way, your toddler’s sense of stability will remain intact, even in the face of a major change.

, Reiterate what an exciting change sleeping in bed alone will be, and let your toddler know you are proud of how big and independent he or she is becoming. Show your toddler how much more room there is in the bed, and remind your toddler of the bedding and toys you picked out together for this moment.

, The first night, your toddler may feel apprehensive. Say goodnight calmly, offer a hug and a kiss, and then leave. If he or she is very upset, go back every ten minutes or so to very briefly reassure the child. Repeat as necessary.

, If your toddler goes to bed without a fuss, overcomes his or her nervousness, or sleeps well in his or her own bed during the night, offer up plenty of praise in the morning. Positive reinforcement will help tremendously with the transition.

, Many toddlers cry, fuss, and beg to come back into your bed. This is normal, so try not to get too upset. If your child sees you getting worked up, the situation will escalate.

, Do not give in to crying or whining; if you do, your toddler will learn that he can manipulate you to get what he or she wants. If your toddler cries and whines from his or her bed, simply check in periodically and offer some brief words of reassurance; if your toddler keeps getting out of bed, simply walk him or her back.


Avoid making exceptions. If you take a break from this consistent behavior because your child is sick or because he or she had a bad dream, you’ll only cause confusion and fuel more resistance.
It can be very difficult for a parent not to give in to this kind of distress. You may feel like you are being too cold or rejecting your child, but ultimately, your toddler will be less confused and feel more secure if you stay as consistent as possible. Keep a warm, loving tone, and let your toddler know you are there, but do not give in, and do not feel guilty.

, If your child continues to cry and fuss at night, try to determine what the reasons are. During the day, when your toddler is calm, discuss it. If it’s just stubbornness and a desire to stay with you at night, just keep being positive and consistent about the change. If it has more to do with fears – of the dark or of monsters – you may be able to resolve the situation by adding a night light and devising some sort of “monster killing” ritual.

, If your toddler continues to resist, you might try sitting in the room until he or she falls asleep. After a few nights, move to the doorway; after a few more nights, move to the hallway outside the room.

, Consider a sticker chart or another reward system to make your toddler more willing to sleep in his or her own room.

For example, you might want to have his bedtime close to yours so that you can both get an optimal amount of sleep.Be flexible with the schedule as necessary., Your newborn may need time to shift into sleep mode. Encouraging relaxation and sleep about an hour before her bedtime helps signal her body and brain that it’s time to go to sleep.Keep your newborn away from bright lights and loud noises.Dim the lights anywhere you and your newborn may be. This signals her that it’s time to sleep.Your baby may fuss and cry as she finds a comfortable position in your arms.

Place a night light in a non-stimulating color like red to help assure him if this is necessary.Keep the room quiet, though you may want to use a white noise machine. This may help dampen other noises and keep your baby asleep.Your baby should have a comfortable but firm mattress, but remove any blankets or soft items so he doesn’t suffocate., Placing your newborn in her crib when she is drowsy but awake helps her associate bed with sleep.This can encourage her to fall and stay asleep without you.Place your baby on her back to sleep.Avoid letting your child sleep with you. Studies have shown that this makes your child more prone to suffocation or strangulation., Although you may be tempted to have your baby close to you in bed, avoid bed-sharing or co-sleeping. Not only can this make it harder for her to fall and stay asleep, but also increases the risk for SIDS.Put your baby’s crib or bassinet in your room if you want her to be near you.

, It’s not uncommon for a baby to fuss during the night. Keeping your nighttime care as low-key as possible can help minimize stimulation and get him back to sleep quickly.Also keep feedings and diaper changes quiet and boring at night to encourage better sleep.

Keep the lights dim and use a soft voice and minimal movements. This helps your baby understand it’s time to sleep and not play., “Sleeping through the night” means different things for babies of different ages. Understanding the ways in which infants sleep may help you formulate a more realistic plan for getting your newborn to sleep through the night.Once babies reach 11 pounds, they generally do not need nighttime feedings.Newborns generally will not sleep longer than three hours at a stretch because they need to eat more often.Between two and three months, babies can sleep for five to six hours at a time, though may need an additional feeding at night.By four months, your baby may be able to sleep for seven to eight hours at a stretch and may also not require feeding.

, Most infants will wriggle, squirm, make noise, and twitch in their sleep. This is completely normal and often doesn’t require your attention.Wait a few minutes after your baby stirs to see if he falls asleep.Attend to you baby only if you suspect he is hungry or uncomfortable., Your baby may have natural sleeping patterns that make her a night owl or early bird. Respecting her schedule and adjusting as necessary may help her — and you — fall and stay asleep more effectively.You may want to gradually alter your baby’s schedule so that she sleeps at times more convenient for you. For example, simple shifts of ½ hour in nap or bedtime from week to week may help her get onto a more normal schedule.

, Your skills as a parent are not related to your ability to get your baby to sleep through the night. Keeping your baby’s sleep schedule in perspective can help you more readily accept and relax about it.Remember that a baby’s sleep patterns can change weekly, and she may have some days where she requires more sleep than others. This is especially true when babies grow or are teething.

, If your baby isn’t sleeping or has other issues that concern you, schedule an appointment with your pediatrician. He may be able to help you establish a better sleeping schedule for your baby or be able to assess if an underlying condition such as colic is keeping your newborn from sleeping through the night."

Take the 2 pre-cut fabric swatches and iron all of the wrinkles out of them so that it is easier to work with the fabric.,
Place both pieces of fabric together with the right sides of fabric touching.,
Use your sewing machine to sew together both sides of your 10 inch (25.4 cm) strips with a ¼ inch seam allowance.,
Turn the fabric right side out by using a safety pin.,
Remove the safety pin.,
Tuck ¼ inch of each open end into the sleeve of fabric and iron both ends flat.

,
Pin a safety pin to each end of the pre-cut elastic.,
Thread the elastic into one open end of the sleeve.,
Pin a straight pin through all 3 layers, approximately ¼ inch from each open end.,
Remove both safety pins and line up each end of elastic with the edges of the fabric.,
Use the sewing machine to stitch both ends of the strap closed, being sure to catch the elastic into the stitches.

,
Stitch down both sides and over both ends to reinforce all stitching.,
Insert one end of the completed band into the loop on the suspender clip.,
Reinforce the stitches securing the suspender clip in place.

,
Stitch one piece of Velcro close to the free end of the strap.,
Complete the strap by attaching the item you chose as an embellishment over the clip.",How to Make a Pacifier Clip3," This step will also assist with proper alignment of both pieces.

, The wrong side of fabric will be facing you. Pin the 2 pieces of fabric in place.

, Be sure to leave both ends open at this point.

, Attach the safety pin to one section of the fabric at an open end. Push the safety pin into the open end and thread it through the inside of your fabric until it emerges out the opposite open end.

, Straighten and adjust your fabric until it lays flat. With seams facing along each side of your fabric, iron the fabric to lay completely flat and crisp.

,, One safety pin will be pushed through the sleeve and 1 will prevent the elastic from slipping all the way into the sleeve.

, Continue threading until your safety pin emerges out the opposite open end. Pull the safety pin all the way through to prevent it from slipping back into the sleeve.

, Be sure to pin through the elastic to prevent it from moving into the sleeve once you remove the safety pins.

, Use a straight pin to keep the 3 layers in place.

,, Keep close to the edges. Not only will this strengthen the piece, it will keep it neat and prevent it from rolling in on itself.

, Fold over approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fabric and secure both pieces of fabric together with a straight pin. Hand-stitch the clip in place to prevent it from slipping while trying to sew fabric together. Remove the pin and use the sewing machine to complete the stitches.

,, Stitch the remaining piece of Velcro 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the first piece. This is where you will loop the pacifier into the strap. Make sure to position the Velcro so that the pieces will stick when they are placed together.

, You will hand stitch this to the side that holds the clip. Position it so that it will cover as much of the exposed clip as possible. Be sure to secure the patch with enough stitches to prevent it from coming loose.

Feed your baby either pumped breast milk or formula (for infants), and avoid water and/or juice. You can also feed him/her certain types of baby food out of a jar (for older babies), but make sure that it is mushed and easy to eat. In a crisis situation, it is best to stick to the bottle which also acts as a pacifier.Clean the bottle. Make sure that there is no leftover formula stuck in the nipple. Do not use any harsh chemicals on the bottle which can contaminate the formula. Use wire brushes to get the hard to reach areas.
Make sure to buy iron-fortified formula. Babies should be drinking about 6-8 ounces of formula per feeding.
Warm the breast milk or formula under warm water. Do not use a microwave which can cause hot spots that burn your baby's mouth.
Hold your baby on his/her back, resting in your arm, as you feed him/her. Maintain control of the bottle with your other hand.;
, After he/she is done eating, he/she may start to cry because of a gas build-up in his/her stomach. The best way to burp your baby is to lean your baby's stomach over your shoulder. One hand should be on the baby's bottom while the other is in the head/neck region. Try to keep the head of your baby facing up so that he/she can release the gas build-up better. Gently bump your shoulder up and down, giving your baby time to belch., Look for signs such as crying, off-putting smell, wetness, or constant movement. You will want to check your baby's diapers constantly so that he/she does not have time to develop diaper rash. Wash your hands before you change the diaper, and always do it in a warm, sanitized location (bathroom sink, kitchen table, etc.). Place a clean towel down on the surface for your baby to lay on.Undo the side straps of the diaper, and wipe away any excess urine/waste using a clean area of the soiled diaper.
Use a clean towel, or cloth, soaked in water to clean your baby's backside and between his legs. You can also use baby wipes. Apply baby powder to help him/her avoid diaper rash.
Place a new diaper underneath him/her. Pull it between his/her legs, and fasten it on both sides.

, Look for crying, especially after a feeding session, or a long day. Lay your baby on his/her back on top of a soft blanket. Grab each of his/her legs and begin to bicycle them (this is the same motion as you would pedal a bicycle). Wait until you either hear his/her relieve himself/herself, or he/she stops crying.You can also contact your doctor about using infant gas drops which help your baby pass gas.
Make sure to consult your doctor about constant gas problems. This could be related to acid reflux, lactose intolerance, constipation, the stomach flu, etc.

, This could be your finger, nipple, baby bottle, or a pacifier. Babies, especially up to 7 months old, have strong sucking needs. This is a quick remedy to a long-term problem. Do not let her suck on it for hours at a time. After 7 or 8 months, you will need to wean your baby off of what she is sucking on.He/she may also want an object which comforts himself/herself. This could be a special teddy bear, blanket, rubber toy, etc. Just make sure that the object you give him/her can't be swallowed.

, Sometimes the best solution is the easiest. A baby will often cry a lot if he/she needs to go to sleep. He/she may also yawn, be a tad cranky, or simply be falling asleep. You can hold him/her in your arms before you take him/her to his/her crib. After he/she is calm, lay him/her down in his/her crib on a soft blanket. A musical mobile hanging above the bed, playing a song, can help lure him/her to sleep. Always keep a baby monitor on if you plan on going out of the room., One of the biggest problems that occurs with babies is the development of colic. This is where your baby will cry incessantly for 3 or 4 hours at a time. If this happens with your baby and you are breastfeeding, watch your diet. Avoid dairy, caffeine, and onions. If your baby continues to cry uncontrollably, it is best to see a doctor for a more professional remedy., This provides your baby with a warm, snug, and secure feeling. The key is to wrap your baby tightly, without over-wrapping. Start by grabbing a small blanket, and lay it so it looks like a diamond. Then take the top corner and fold it all the way down to the other corner. This should create what looks like an upside-down triangle. Center your baby in the middle of the blanket and pull his/her arms inward.Take the left corner and pull it all the way across the baby. Tuck it underneath his/her back on the other side.
Take the right corner and pull it all the way to the left. Tuck that underneath his/her back as well. You can use a small pin to secure the blanket (don't stick your baby). Finish the fold by tucking the bottom of the blanket underneath the baby.
Keep the top open so the baby's head is fully exposed. You do not want to smother your baby. You can also pull back some of the blanket at any time you think it is too tight.

, Babies, especially during the first few months, need lots of care and attention. Hold your baby in your dominant arm, while the other arm secures the baby. Bend your elbows at 45 degree angles. Rest your baby's head in the crook of your elbow. Move your body slightly up and down as you hold your baby. Make sure that your baby is resting against your body, as he/she may like to hear your heartbeat and see your face.You can also drape your baby over your shoulder as long as one hand secures the back and the other secures the head. The stomach of your baby should press against your shoulder.
Use a baby sling if your arms get too tired. You will wrap the sling around your neck/upper back. Make sure that your baby's face isn't covered as he/she rests in the sling.

, While some babies like noises, some like it to be quiet and dark. Dim the lights in your house so that they do not bother the baby's eyes. Turn off the television, the vacuum cleaner, hair dryer, etc. Or, you can place your baby in a room nearby that provides for more sound insulation. You might also want to check the internal temperature of the house. If it is too hot, or too cold, that can bother the baby's nerves., While some babies like the peace and quiet, some others like background noises. Some great options are: turn on your vacuum cleaner, turn on a fan, or say ""Shhhh"" slowly and softly in his/her ear. You can also use white noise to calm your crying baby. This could mean playing soothing music (waterfall, beach, etc.) or placing your baby near (NOT on) the washing machine. Babies love the consistent sound of rushing water., Secure your baby in a stroller or place your baby in a sling around your shoulder. Your baby will appreciate seeing new things, and breathing fresh air. Don't go too far away from your house in case there is an emergency with your baby. Always bring a bottle, pacifier, diaper, etc. with you when you leave. Go walk with your baby for about 1/2-1 hour. The bumps of the stroller will also calm your baby down.Make sure not to go anywhere too rugged. Stay away from stone driveways or mountainous terrain.
If you live in the city, especially in places like Los Angeles and New York, check the air quality on the local news before you leave. If you live in the city or country, make sure that you don't get behind cars which can spray exhaust.

, If your baby is crying and having trouble sleeping, sometimes the easiest remedies are the best. Sing a lullaby to your baby, or just hum as you watch your baby. He/she will focus on the notes and your face, and finally relax. As you are singing to him, you can either lay him/her in his/her crib, or hold and rock him/her in your arms., Sometimes babies just want attention and focus from their parents. You should have a few toys lying around at all times, whether it be a teddy bear, a ball, or a comforting object. Rub your nose against your baby's while speaking in ""baby talk."" Grab your baby underneath his/her arms and lift your baby up into the air slowly. Go up and down, and watch as your baby goes from crying to smiling., Put your hands over your eyes, pull them away, and say ""peek-a-boo!"" Make funny faces at your baby by scrunching your face, and wait for them to laugh. Place them on the carpet and crawl around on the floor with them. Place your hand in front of them face and wait for him/her to touch your hand with his/hers., The warm touch of your hands can console your baby almost instantly, especially when them is feeling muscle or joint pain (commonly referred to as ""growing pains""). You will want to lay your baby in a comfortable position, like on the couch or the bed. Take your baby's clothes off except for his/her diaper. Use baby oil or lotion to conduct the massage. You will want to work in soft, gentle motions. If your baby cries even stronger when you begin to give the massage, it is best to move onto a different step.Make sure to work the face, arms, legs, back, and stomach.
Use slow circular motions as well as hand-over-hand motions. Use thumb-over-thumb motions to massage your baby's hands and feet. Separate and massage each finger and toe.

, You can go visit his/her grandparents' house, or to your job. Sometimes seeing different faces can cause your baby to cheer up. They will also be able to provide love and affection when you are worn out throughout the day. Make sure that the people are safe to be around, and never leave your baby with them unless you sincerely trust them. Breathing fresh air, going in a car ride, and traveling to new places can excite your baby's senses and make him/her forget about crying.Make sure if you take your baby in a car that you are using adequate safety measures, such as placing your baby in the back seat, in a secure baby carriage/child's chair.

Bathe your baby.,
Carry your baby around in a sling.,
Move your baby.,
Ask for advice.,
Reduce environmental stimulation.,
Provide distractions for your baby.,
Adopt the right position.",How to Feed a Colicky Baby1," Your baby might relax if given a warm bath. To bathe your little one, fill a tub up with a few inches of warm water. Sit your child in the tub and use a cup to pour warm water over their legs and shoulders. You could also use a mild soap in the water, but be careful not to get any in your baby’s eyes.Never leave your little one unattended in a tub.
If your child cries as soon as they get out of the warm bath, you could combine bath time with feeding time by feeding the baby while they sit in the warm bath.;
, A baby sling is an apparatus that allows your baby to stay safe and secure against your chest. Carrying your baby about in a sling should make them feel more safe and secure. These feelings will help your baby relax and, hopefully, stop crying long enough for you to feed them.You can easily obtain a baby sling online or from many retail stores.
Follow manufacturer instructions when using your baby sling.

, Before feeding your colicky baby, walk around with them, or even just rock them gently back and forth. Try a variety of positions like rocking while walking, rocking while sitting, or rocking while standing.Your child might also relax if driven around in a car. If you have a car seat, strap your baby in and go for a drive just before feeding time.Your little one might also benefit from spending time on a swing or vibrating seat. Ensure your child is secure when moving them gently on a vibrating or swing seat.

, Talk to other people who have had children with colic. You might be able to get other ideas about how to feed your baby from people who have been there. Connect with your friends or family members who have also fed colicky babies, or with other parents in online forums and chat rooms.You might also ask questions such as, “Do colicky babies play with toys?” or “How did you get your colicky babies to sleep?”

, When you feed your little one, do so in a space that is quiet and free of distractions.Turn the TV and radio off. Keep other people and barking pets away. This could help your baby relax and reduce their symptoms.You might also try feeding your child in a darkened room.
This is most likely to work if your little one is younger than two months old., While some colicky babies are best fed under quiet and stimulation-free conditions, others are easier to feed when presented with other things to occupy their attention. For instance, you could play gentle music by Miles Davis or Mozart while feeding your child. Your little one might also be easier to feed if you feed them in a room with a running dryer or vacuum., Whether you are breastfeeding or bottle feeding, adopting the right position can help your baby avoid developing a worse case of colic. In either case, it is important to support your baby’s head and aim their mouth toward either the breast or nipple of the bottle. Your little one should not have to turn their head in order to feed. Clutch the child close to your chest during feeding.If breastfeeding, allow your baby to lean toward you, rather than leaning toward your baby.
Colicky babies might be happier feeding if the mother lies on her back or reclines while feeding. They might also benefit from a mother who lies on her side.If bottle-feeding, do not lay your baby on their back. This could cause them to choke as they drink."
"
Alternate with a friend.,
Allow the baby to get enough milk.,
Burp your baby.",How to Feed a Colicky Baby2," Since colicky babies may seem to cry nonstop, feeding – or even just being around – one can be exhausting and stressful. In order to reduce your stress, take turns feeding your child with someone else. For instance, you could ask your partner or another family member to feed your little one.Don’t alternate breastfeeding and bottle feeding too often. Feeding is an experience that babies use to build trust with the person who feeds them.If you are the mother of the baby and wish to only provide them with breastmilk, you can use a breast pump to bottle your breastmilk. Your partner or another family member can then feed your little one and give you a break.

, Whether you’re breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, it is important that your child receives enough milk. If bottle-feeding, ensure the bottle is full in order so that your baby can get enough milk without having to refill a bottle. If breastfeeding, wait for the colicky baby to release the breast of their own accord before switching to another breast..Try to feed a baby as soon as they show signs of hunger. If you wait too long, they have may have a harder time feeding.
The amount of time a colicky baby will take to consume all the milk in a particular breast or bottle depends on the baby and the mother.
Offer the opposite breast (or another bottle) only after the child has emptied the first bottle or detached themselves from the breast.
If the baby is still hungry, they will continue to feed when offered the other breast or the second bottle.
Mothers who switch breasts on their children too quickly during the feeding process might be preventing their child from getting the fat and nutrient-dense milk that is only available after feeding continues for a longer period of time.

, Since colic might be worsened by swallowing too much air, you may be able to alleviate your colicky baby’s symptoms by burping them more frequently.Sit upright with your colicky baby against your chest. The baby’s chin should rest on your shoulder. Use one hand to support your colicky baby and pat the baby gently on their back using your other hand.It might be easier to burp your baby if you do so while in a rocking chair or while gently rocking your baby.
Burp your baby both during and after feeding.

"
"
Use a nipple shield.,
Switch the way you’re feeding.,
Mix lactase drops into your baby’s milk.,
Consult a doctor.",How to Feed a Colicky Baby3," Your baby might be colicky because they slip off the nipple or gets too much milk at once. A nipple shield is a small flexible silicone or rubber device you can place over the nipple to help your little one get a better grip on their mother’s breast and modulate the flow of breastmilk. If you believe your child’s condition is caused by an excessively strong flow of milk or an inability to latch onto the breast properly, try a nipple shield.Nipple shields are available at your local pharmacy.

, There are three options for feeding your baby. You could breastfeed, bottle feed using breast milk, or bottle feed using formula. If your child shows no signs of improvement after every other attempt to soothe or improve their feeding habits, try changing the way you’re delivering milk to them.For instance, if you’re breastfeeding your colicky baby and cannot seem to alleviate their colic, try bottle feeding instead.
Talk to your doctor before changing how you feed your baby. Your doctor can rule out other underlying problems. For example, they may recommend a special formula if they believe your child is allergic to dairy milk or they may suggest that you cut out certain items--such as caffeine, dairy, or soy-- from your diet.

, Lactase drops are a supplement containing lactase, an enzyme that helps your colicky baby break down the primary sugar found in milk, lactose. There is some evidence that lactase drops will reduce the time your child spends crying. Always speak to a pediatrician before giving your baby any medication or supplements, including lactase drops.You can obtain lactase drops at your local pharmacy or online.
If you breastfeed your little one, you will have to first obtain a breast pump to express breastmilk into a bottle. You can then mix the lactase drops into the breast milk and feed it to your baby in a bottle.
Follow manufacturer directions for more information about how to add lactase drops to your baby’s formula or milk. Typically, you’ll just stir two to four drops of lactase into the milk., There are a number of other conditions that could be confused with colic, so it is a good idea to at least talk to your baby’s doctor about their condition. Note the frequency, time, place, and duration of your little one’s crying before speaking with your doctor. Relate the information you noted so that your child’s doctor can make an accurate diagnosis.The doctor may be able to determine if colic or acid reflux is causing your baby's problems. Acid reflux is often confused with colic, and it is a common cause of fussiness in babies.

Accept that toddlers are reluctant to give up your attention.,
Recognize the role of fatigue.,
Consider your child’s fears.,
Adjust the afternoon nap.,
Do not punish your child with enforced napping.,
Choose an ideal bedtime.,
Make your child’s room an inviting place for sleeping.,
Stick to a consistent bedtime routine.,
Stay calm.,
Remind your child of the routine.,
Kill the monsters.,
Be consistent.,
Check on your child at regular intervals.,
Consider promising a reward in the morning.",How to Get a Crying Toddler to Sleep," For many toddlers, “it’s time for bed” basically means, “it’s time to be all by yourself, with no one loving you or paying attention to you or keeping you company.” Understandably, they do not feel especially happy with that idea – and so they will keep crying, calling out for you, and getting out of bed in search of another round of cuddling and attention.;
, Ironically, toddlers who are overly tired tend to resist bedtime the most. Exhaustion makes toddlers cranky, weepy, uncomfortable, and uncooperative, setting the stage for a long battle at bedtime.


Usually, toddlers run and play enough during the day to be tired by bedtime, but occasionally, you may run into a problem with a lack of fatigue, rather than an excess of it. If your child spends too much time sitting in front of the television or computer, or if bedtime is truly too early, he or she may have too much energy to wind down.

, Children have vivid imaginations and difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality, and they may be susceptible to nightmares or afraid to be alone in the dark. These kinds of issues may play a role in your toddler’s unwillingness to go to bed.

, If you’ve been dealing with prolonged and difficult bedtimes, aim to have your toddler nap for about an hour to an hour and a half in the afternoon. Too little rest will make your toddler exhausted and cranky at bedtime; too little will leave your toddler with energy to burn.


Studies suggest that too little sleep may raise toddler’s levels of cortisol – a stress hormone that can make it difficult to get quality sleep. A brief nap in the afternoon may prevent cortisol levels from rising.

, If you do, your toddler will associate sleep with punishment – he or she will be confused when you inflict this “punishment” every night and more likely to resist.

, Don’t try to put your toddler to bed before he or she is tired, and don’t let him or her stay up too late, either. Toddlers need about fourteen hours of sleep per day (though many, unfortunately, get much less), so if your child is taking a one-hour nap in the afternoon, aim for a bedtime that allows for thirteen hours of sleep.


When choosing a bedtime, don’t forget to consider your own needs. Don’t sacrifice your child’s needs, but do consider finding a bedtime that works for your toddler and also allows some time for you to unwind in the evening, alone or with your partner.
Toddlers can’t tell time, but you can teach them to recognize the signs of bedtime: it starts getting dark, perhaps everyone eats dinner together. Making your child aware of these signs will reinforce the idea that bedtime is unavoidable.

, Buy bedding that your toddler likes, and have his or her favorite stuffed animals and blankets available.

, An ideal routine would have multiple steps and take at least an hour, so that your toddler gets used to the process and knows what to expect – say, for example, a bath, then pajamas, then a bedtime snack, then two stories, then teeth brushing, then ten minutes of cuddling time, then sleep. Once established, stick to this routine every night.


For best results, give your child some control over some aspects of the routine. Offer a choice of snacks, for example, and let your toddler choose the stories.

, Even if you follow all the steps to prepare for a peaceful bedtime routine, your toddler may sometimes cry and refuse to go to sleep. If you get upset or angry, your child will pick up on those emotions, and the battle will escalate. If, on the other hand, you maintain a low voice and a calm, matter-of-fact attitude, your child will be more likely to stay calm.

, If your toddler keeps crying or calling you, remind him or her calmly that it’s time for bed: “We already had your bath, and we put on your pajamas, and we had your snack and stories. We brushed your teeth and cuddled. Now it’s time to sleep.”

, If your toddler seems genuinely frightened (rather than just stubborn), you can help eliminate his or her fears by adding a night light or getting creative – think up a secret weapon, and use it together to banish monsters from the room. Just don’t allow this step to become too long or arduous, and avoid letting your child turn it into a kind of playtime.

, Avoid saying, “okay, one more book” or “okay, ten more minutes of cuddling.” If you do, then your child has essentially won the battle and gotten what he or she wanted. Reiterate that it’s bedtime.

, If your toddler is truly distressed, try leaving the room for periods of ten minutes at a time. Then come back, reassure your child briefly – don’t give in to more stories or cuddling, just calmly remind your child that you’re there and that it’s bedtime – and repeat as necessary.

, If you are desperate, you might consider a bribe: tell your child that if he or she goes to sleep without any more fuss, you will do something fun the next day.


This should be a last resort. If you use bribery too often, your child will come to expect rewards for going to bed. This will ultimately set you back in your efforts to establish a peaceful bedtime.

Identify why the baby is crying.,
Know that infants from 6-46 weeks old often have random bouts of crying.,
Use a comforting, calming hold on the baby to instantly quiet it.,
Make sure that their clothes are loose and provide enough warmth.,
Eliminate irritating foods from your diet that she may digest while nursing.,
Check for a fever.,
Keep calm and patient in the face of persistent crying.",How to Calm a Crying Baby1," Is he/she hungry? Does he/she need a diaper change? Does he/she need to be burped? There are not that many reasons why babies cry - their world is limited to feeding, comfort, companionship, health, and sleep, so it shouldn't be hard to decipher their need. In general, the best order to follow would be to:


Check his diaper.
Feed him.
Burp him over your shoulder.;
, Unfortunately, there is little you can do. As long as you have a baby monitor, place the child in their crib and walk away. If the crying persists for more than 10-15 minutes, check back in to make sure nothing is wrong.


If you've fed her, made sure she is warm, burped her, and changed her diaper, then there is little more you can do. Go relax for a few moments and come back after she's gotten over her crying spell., This pediatrician-approved technique is a great way to calm a baby down no matter the circumstances. It is often used after shots or other procedures that can quickly upset a small child.


Tuck both of the baby's arms across it's chest.
Use your palm to secure the arms to the baby's chest.
Grab the baby around the diaper, holding them securely.
Gently rock and shake the baby with both hands, keeping it at a 45-degree angle.
Make sure one hand supports their head and chin and the other has a firm hold between they're legs., If you're cold in the house, chances are your baby is too. Make sure their clothes are loose enough that their skin can breathe, and that they are comfortably warm. If in doubt, it can't hurt to add another blanket and see how they respond., Colic is when a baby cries for more than three hours a day, and it usually resolves itself by three months. You can, however, take steps to avoid excess crying due to colic by eliminating:


Dairy
Caffeine
Onions
Very spicy or irritating foods., Using a rectal or oral thermometer, see if your baby is running a temperature. This sort of discomfort will cause a baby to cry incessantly. If the baby is warmer than 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit (the average high for a normal baby), you should call your pediatrician immediately., If you feel your patience snapping, have someone else take care of the baby, even if this means going to a neighbor and asking for help until you regain your composure. Take a good walk around the block to clear your mind and frustrations. Don't be surprised to find your baby calm upon your return; they often pick up on a parents' tiredness and distress.



Never shake a baby -- it can cause serious and life-threatening injuries.
Many doctors suggest placing the baby in its bed and stepping out for a few minutes. Sometimes babies just need to cry for a little while."
"
Swaddle him in a warm blanket.,
Give her something to suck on.,
Sing a song or hum quietly under your breath.,
Walk around slowly in a dark area of the house.,
Gently massage your baby's feet, hands, and stomach.,
Play with your child to engage it.,
Call a hotline specifically for parents struggling with fussy babies.,
Call your pediatrician if the baby is still crying after you've checked the obvious causes.",How to Calm a Crying Baby2," Swaddling is believed to create a tight, warm environment similar to the womb. Even snugly wrapping your little tyke in a blanket and holding him close to your chest should help quickly calm him down. Get him warm and snug and start rocking.Lay the baby on its side after swaddling. It better mimics the feeling of the womb and calms them faster.

, A pacifier or your finger is perfect. Sucking actually steadies a baby's heart rate, relaxes his stomach, and calms flailing limbs. This might be the ticket to a quiet, contented infant., A gentle voice and simple rhythm are calming no matter what age you are. The gentle rhythm, combined with soft rocking and holding your child, should work. Any soft music will do.


Try simple, gently ""shhh"" sounds if you don't have a song in mind.
Even white noise can have a calming effect on a baby -- running water and vacuums can save even the most tone-deaf parent., Walk at a slow steady speed. Babies love rhythmic motion, and the lack of light will slowly make them sleepy. If you can, go outdoors-- the change to fresh air may help them calm down.

, Gentle, calming movements are all that matters. Babies love to be touched, so slow, consistent massaging might slow them down and quiet their lungs., Play some peek-a-boo. Lie them on their back and rotate their feet like they were riding a bike. Make silly faces and talk to the child. Just being a distracting, stimulating influence may be enough to get them to stop crying. Babies need to be entertained-- entertain them!, If you're out of options, it is time to look for help. The following numbers will help you calm down and provide potential solutions for your exact situation:


24-Hour Parent Helpline: 1-888-435-7553
Crying Baby Hotline: 1-866-243-2229
Fussy Baby Hotline: 1-888-431-BABY, If your baby won't stop screaming despite a clean diaper, full belly, and general comfort, you should call your pediatrician for advice. There is no reason to fear anything -- but you should verify your specific situation with a professional.


If the crying is high-pitched, random, and the baby seems tense, he/she may have colic, a crying disorder. Luckily, colic tends to go away by the time your baby is 12-14 weeks old.
Note when a baby cries to find patterns -- right before a nap, after waking up, after eating certain foods, etc. Pay attention to your baby's signals to prevent future outbursts.
Baby's crying usually peaks around 6 weeks, but it eases off afterward."

Massage your baby’s belly.,
Massage your baby’s back.",How to Calm a Gassy Newborn2," Lay your baby on their back and pump their legs back and forth as if your baby was riding an invisible bicycle.

Get gas drops.,
Hold your baby in a face-down position.",How to Calm a Gassy Newborn3," The warm water will often soothe your baby and help alleviate some of the discomfort. A nice warm bath may even help to break up some of the gas bubbles and release the gas, especially if you combine it with some belly massages for your baby.If you like, you can take a bath with your baby so that it is easier to monitor their behavior and to massage their belly.

Feed your baby before he cries.,
Check the bottle.,
Adjust your diet if you are breastfeeding.",How to Calm a Gassy Newborn4," When your baby cries from hunger, that is their way of telling you that they can’t wait any longer to eat. If you let your baby get to this point, they will eat more rapidly once you begin feeding them and this will lead to an increase in air intake.A crying or hungry baby will gulp more air in as they feed, causing more gas in your baby.

, If a baby ingests too much or too little milk or formula at a time, this can also cause them to swallow more air than they should during feeding. You should check the bottle’s nipple to make sure that the opening isn’t too large or too small.Additionally, you’ll want to get the angle right for feeding (whether bottle-feeding or breastfeeding). With a bottle, you’ll want to tilt the bottle so that the entire nipple fills with milk. Always make sure that your baby’s head is higher than their stomach.
You can also try different types of bottles to see if one works better. The bottles that are angled, collapsible, or have a bag inside often reduce extra air and gas.

, Some foods are notorious for causing gas. If you’re eating these food items while you’re breastfeeding, then your baby is ingesting them too. Try to cut back on foods that are hard to digest and are known to cause gas, or at least try to space them out during the day.Some foods to limit if you’re having trouble with gas include:Broccoli
Cauliflower
Cabbage
Brussel sprouts
Onions
Beans

Notice if your baby burps.,
See if your baby is fussy.,
Check whether your baby is bloated.",How to Calm a Gassy Newborn5," If your baby is burping on their own, this means that there is air trapped inside of their body and you may need to take action to help relieve any potential discomfort. Try burping your baby or massing their belly.


Farting is also a tell-tale sign of gassiness in babies.

, Babies usually cry for a reason – it is one of the ways they communicate with you. A crying baby needs attention to figure out what they need and trapped air/gas might be the reason your baby is acting fussy, especially if your baby doesn’t usually act fussy very often.


If your baby is crying and you can determine the reason – you have fed them, changed them, and given them a nap – then your baby might have gas.

, If your baby seems bloated, with a slightly distended belly, this is probably due to excess gas in their abdomen.

Talk to the baby.,
Comfort the baby with touch.,
Try peekaboo.,
Read a book together.,
Play the imitation game.,
Give the baby a change in scenery.",How to Entertain an Unhappy Baby1," A simple way to entertain a baby is to just talk about anything in a soft, kind voice. Babies love being talked to.


Use ""parentese"" instead of ""baby talk."" Baby talk is made up of sounds and nonsense words. Meanwhile, parentese uses actual words in short, simple sentences spoken in a repetitive sing-song manner. Parentese is more enjoyable to babies than adult talk and will help them learn language, while baby talk may actually delay language development.A baby should get undivided attention several times a day regardless of how unhappy he or she seems.;
, Touch can be a baby's primary source of entertainment, especially at very young ages. If the baby starts to fuss more with any of these methods, stop and try a different one.


Hold the baby. Try to simply pick up and hold the baby and look for a response. Sometimes babies become upset because they feel insecure, and an adult holding them makes them feel safe again.
Bounce the baby on your knee. Sit on a chair and carefully sit the baby on your thigh near your knee. Make sure you and the baby are facing each other and give the baby extra support by holding the baby's torso with your hands. Slowly bounce the baby up and down by lifting your knee up an inch or two. If a baby starts to look sick from the up-and-down motion, stop immediately. He or she is probably getting nauseous and may vomit on you.
Tickle the baby gently. Brush your fingertips gently against the bottom of the baby's feet and across the tummy. Tickling generally won't work to entertain babies under four months in any obvious way. Babies do not start to laugh in response to tickling until they're between four to six months in age., Very young babies don't understand object permanence, meaning that they think when they can no longer see something, it ceases to exist. To these babies, peekaboo can appear genuinely surprising or even scary. ""Looming"" where an adult slowly moves his or her face in and out of few is often entertaining at this age.Starting at around six to eight months, babies begin to learn object permanence. Instead of being surprised, they begin to understand the ""joke"" and start to love playing peekaboo. This enjoyment usually lasts until they're about one year in age. Playing peekaboo is simple:


Start by making your face level with the baby's and maintain eye contact. Be sure to smile during the whole game.
Place your hands or a blanket in front of your face
Try asking: ""Where am I?"" The baby may point and/or say: ""Here!""
Show your face and say: ""Here I am!"" and/or ""Peekaboo!"" Then start over.
Depending on where the baby is in skill development, the baby may take a turn by covering his or her own face., Select a picture book. Get eye level to the baby and slowly read the book out loud. The baby will enjoy the sound of your voice and the pictures on the page. Be sure to go fairly slowly with young infants and faster with older babies., Try to get the baby to do what you do. Make an exaggerated expression with your face right in front of the baby's. Praise the baby when he or she matches you to teach the baby how to play. With older babies, you can start incorporating body and limb movements into your game. Remember that very young infants don't yet understand more complicated motions., Just like adults, babies sometimes get bored sitting around looking at the same place all day. Move the baby to a new place and see how he or she reacts.


Switch rooms. Very young babies will be amazed by their new surroundings. Watch them look around, exploring with their developing eyes.
Go for a walk. As babies mature, they require more novelty. If an older baby is being fussy, go for a walk with the baby in either a sling or a stroller. The baby will likely enjoy both the movement and new sensory experiences. A walk around the neighborhood or down to the coffee shop will also give the baby a chance to interact with new people."
"
Provide an enriched environment.,
Give the baby a favorite toy.,
Try leaving the baby ""alone."",
Provide variety.,
Encourage exploration.",How to Entertain an Unhappy Baby2," Some forms of independence can be learned at a very young age. Teach self-entertainment to even the youngest baby by providing enough sensory stimuli to keep the baby busy.


For the most basic type of self-entertainment, make sure a baby has an appropriate mobile over his or her crib. Crib mobiles should have bright, bold colors and simple, large shapes. You can either pick out a mobile from a store or make one yourself. Put the mobile above the crib, preferably in a spot where it will spin slowly. A young baby's eyes cannot track fast movements.Avoid places with a stronger air flow. A baby watching a mobile may seem to stare off into space, looking bored to an adult. In reality, the baby is engrossed with simply looking at these simple objects.
Play gentle music for audio stimulation. It doesn't need to be Mozart for a baby to learn from it. Just make sure the baby seems to enjoy the music. Like the mobile, babies can be entertained with very simple sensory experiences.Being allowed to play independently is actually a very important part of a baby's early development. If babies are never left to learn how to entertain themselves, they may end up too easily distracted and dependent on adults., Toys are an important part of an enriched environment. Consider saving a certain toy for special occasions, such as needing to entertain an especially unhappy baby.


Self-directed play develops many important skills in addition to keeping babies entertained. For example, simple building blocks go a long way in promoting motor skills and creativity. For older babies, dolls can encourage pretend play. Noisy toys will provide auditory stimulation while teaching babies about cause and effect.
Don't leave very young babies alone with toys. Even the sturdiest-seeming toy may break into smaller pieces and become a choking hazard. Plush toys aren't completely safe, either, as they can suffocate an unattended baby.
Remember that simple, inexpensive toys work just as well as expensive electronic ones., Start out engaging with the baby using a toy or book. Once the baby gets engrossed in the activity, walk away for a few minutes.


Don't ever leave a baby under one-year-old completely alone. Instead, simply sit a few feet away in a position where you can see the baby but the baby can't see you. Talk to the baby every few minutes to help the baby feel safe and secure.Make sure any place you put a baby is completely baby-proofed and secure.Once babies learn how to entertain themselves with what they have on hand, they can become less fussy and easier to entertain directly.

, Even heavily enriched environments should be changed from time to time. Try taking the baby to new places for your walks. When baby is especially fussy, try introducing a brand new toy. Consider periodically redecorating the baby's play area., Once babies learn to crawl, they can begin to entertain themselves in many new and exciting ways. An effective way of encouraging self-directed play is to keep a baby curious. When introducing a new toy to a play area, try placing it a few feet away and praising the baby when he or she crawls over to it. Never scold a baby for being curious unless the baby tries to do something seriously dangerous."
"
Consider obvious stressors.,
Check the baby's diaper.,
See if the baby is hungry.,
Try burping the baby.,
Learn to recognize fussy babies.",How to Entertain an Unhappy Baby3," If something is making the baby upset, you won't really be able to successfully entertain until you solve the problem. Check for sources of loud noise and other discomfort. Look for anything that could be frightening to a baby. Do anything you can to make the baby's environment free of stress.


Does the baby look sick or have a fever? It may be time to see a pediatrician.

, Babies with dirty diapers feel uncomfortable and are often quick to express unhappiness. Take a peek to see if the diaper is soiled. If so, change the diaper and look for any change in the baby's demeanor.

, Babies usually eat every three to four hours. If you've just had to change a diaper but the baby is still crying, then there's a good chance he or she is also hungry.If you're the baby's parent or primary caregiver, you'll likely learn that the baby uses different ""cries"" to communicate. For example, you may start to tell the difference between a ""hungry cry"" and a ""dirty diaper cry"" without having to check., Babies swallow a lot of air while they're still nursing and need to be burped frequently. Hold the baby up to your shoulder and pat the baby gently between the shoulder blades. You'll know the baby was feeling gassy if you hear a burp. If the baby continues to fuss, then you know the problem isn't just a little gas.

, If you can't find anything that's causing the baby to be upset, then you may be dealing with a fussy baby. When it comes to babies, ""fussy"" is a catchall term that simply means a baby becomes unhappy easily and often. Sometimes you can figure out a way to combat fussiness.


Think about times when the baby is unhappy for no apparent reason. If the baby seems to have crying episodes at the same time each day regardless of environment and cannot be cheered up, then the baby may have colic. Luckily, babies tend to grow out of colic by five months of age.On the other hand, does the baby seem to become upset most often when alone and/or in a quiet room? Does the baby seem to never get upset in boisterous gatherings with a lot of people? Then this may simply be a ""high need"" baby who loves being around people.
Just like adults, some babies simply need more stimulation and attention than others to be content.
High need babies tend to have difficulty soothing and entertaining themselves.
Be extra patient with high need babies while you teach them to be more independent. If you're dealing with a high need baby, you may also simply need to do more entertaining than you're accustomed to doing."

Though different forms of motion work best for different babies, you can try a variety of strategies to see what’s best for your baby. Though you may be used to the image of a mother and father rocking their children, just make sure you don’t put your baby in motion for so long that you get tired.

, Side lying can be another source of calm and comfort for your baby. To do it properly, just hold your baby at an angle and allow him/her to be on a side. Your baby can stop being fussy simply by changing the way that he/she is lying down. You can do this in your arms as long as you avoid placing the baby on his/her side in his/her crib, or this can cause him/her to roll over on his/her stomach, which will increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)., Making a soothing noise can really help your baby calm down and be less fussy. Just hearing a new sound can make your baby interested and alert and can help alleviate the pain he/she was feeling earlier. You can use your surroundings to find an appropriate noise or sound or you can even do the work yourself. Here are some sounds that may help calm down your fussy baby:


Turning on a white noise machine
Soft singing
Humming
Turning the radio on static
Turning on the vacuum in the other room
Running a faucet
Playing soft music
Playing nature sounds

, Swaddling is a great way to calm your fussy baby; this is because your baby felt warm and comfortable in your womb and swaddling your baby can help mimic this safe feeling. To swaddle your baby, you should use a small and lightweight blanket, helping your baby stay tucked in so he/she doesn’t disturb himself/herself by flailing his/her limbs around. To keep your baby safe from SIDS or from having trouble breathing, it’s important to make sure that your baby isn’t swaddled too tight and that he/she is placed on his/her back; you should also avoid swaddling your baby with a pacifier to avoid choking and making sure your baby can breathe. Here's how you should go about swaddling your baby:Lay out the blanket on a flat surface.
Fold down one of the corners and place the baby’s head over the fold.
Wrap one side of the blanket around the baby, pinning his/her arm down.
Take the point below your baby’s feet and pull it up, tucking it into the top of the blanket point that was tightly wound around.
Take the other side of the blanket and wrap it around your baby so his/her other arm is firmly tucked in.

, A warm bath can be the perfect soothing technique for some babies. It can help get them ready for a nap or just relax them and make them feel less tense, just as a warm bath has been proven to help many adults relieve tension in the past. Though this doesn’t work for all babies, you can try it to see if it has a positive impact on your child. Unfortunately, some babies actually get agitated after warm baths, so be vigilant when you do try this technique to see the effect it’s really having on your baby.

, If your baby is fussy, then he/she may be wanting something to suck on. He/she may not need a breast or a bottle but you can find something else to do the trick. You can give him/her a pacifier, put his/her thumb in his/her mouth, or even give him/her your pinkie nail, with the nail side down. Your baby may feel comforted from these simple offerings.

, Another thing you can do is to gently massage your baby’s body. Touch his/her palms, the pads of his/her feet, his/her shoulders, and the rest of his/her body gently so that he/she is soothed by your loving touch. You can just use the pads of your fingers to gently massage your baby, helping ease the tension that he/she is feeling.Just remember that, much like a warm bath, some babies can actually be more agitated after a massage, so you should be vigilant when you try it so you see how your baby feels.

, Your baby may very well be fussy because he/she just wants a change of scenery. Changing your scenery, whether you move to a different room or add some exciting elements to the room you’re in, can give your baby something else to pay attention to and can take his/her mind off of his/her agitation. If you don’t have the energy for anything too elaborate, you can simply move to a different room or stand near the window and face the outdoors. Here are some other tricks you can try to mix things up for your baby:


Look at your fish tank, a bright painting, or anything else exciting in your environment
Turn on your overhead fan
Dim the lights
Move to your backyard or front porch
Give your baby a new toy

, Sometimes babies end up making themselves more upset by their own loud tears. You can help calm them down by getting them to be quieter until their tears and fussiness stops all together. To do this, you can gently shush your baby in a sweet, calm way — as opposed to the way a student might be shushed by a librarian. In order to shush your baby, you should simply softly speak or shush just a bit louder than your baby and then slowly lower the volume of your voice until your baby’s voice matches yours.

, Babies are gassier than adults, and this can lead to pain and discomfort. a. To burp your baby, all you have to do is hold him/her in your left arm, having the side of his/her face on your shoulder. Then, pat your baby’s back gently until you hear a burp. Rubbing your baby’s back from the bottom upward can also help ease your baby’s pain. But just picking up your baby will often help., Make sure that the clothes are not too tight or pinching your child. Tags or seams may be another issue. Make sure that the clothes are of a comfortable material.


Additionally, your baby may be feeling too hot or cold in the clothes. Feel your baby’s skin and make sure this isn’t a factor.

, Your baby may just be fussy because you are doing something new and he/she doesn’t like it. Maybe you switched to a different brand of formula, maybe you took your baby for a walk earlier than usual, or maybe you’re spending time in a new part of the house your baby isn’t used to. Though you can’t stick to the same routine forever, you should note that this can be contributing to the baby’s fussiness.


If you’re trying to make a change, you can try to ease the baby into it, by going for a walk 15 minutes earlier every day instead of taking a walk 2 hours earlier one day, for example.

, One reason for your baby to be fussy is just that he/she may be tired. If you see him/her yawning or just seeming restless, then put him/her down for a nap. Your baby may not be aware of the fact that he/she needs more rest, but you should let him/her calm down, turn off the lights, and soothe him/her until he/she is ready for sleep.


Even if your baby is acting very fussy and is active, this may be a sign that he/she feels overworked and needs some help calming down.

, Another reason why your baby may be fussy is because there may be too much going on at home. Maybe you have a loud TV or music on, maybe the lights are too bright, maybe there are too many people around or maybe there are just too many toys in your baby’s crib. This is a major reason for a baby to get fussy, and if you suspect that this is the case, then you may need to simplify things and reduce the noise and excitement around the house for a while to calm your fussy baby.See what an impact turning down the sound or the lights may have on your baby. You’d be surprised by how much better your baby may instantly feel.
If you are introducing new people to the baby, try to do it one at a time in a calm, gentle way. Your baby is likely to feel overwhelmed and fussy if there are ten new relatives hovering over him all at once. Or it is in the middle of a loud restaurant rather than a quiet living room.

, One reason why your baby might be crying or wailing is simply because he/she is feeling neglected and wants more attention. This can happen if your baby has been alone for a while, if you haven’t made physical contact for a few hours, or if you’re just not giving your child enough time. If this is the case, then you should hold, kiss, hug, or just spend time with your baby. This can help ease the fussiness pretty quickly, if this is your baby’s reason for being upset.If your baby is crying, ask yourself when the last time you held your baby was. If more than a few hours have passed, then you should give your baby more physical affection immediately.

, Not all cries should be treated alike. This takes time and attention, but as you get to know your fussy baby, you will be able to distinguish between his/her various cries. One cry may mean he/she is hungry, while another may let you know he/she is wet. Though each baby is different, it is important to know that hungry babies tend to quietly fuss and squirm, and to escalate their cries as their hunger increases. A baby who is feeling pain, whether it’s from illness, gas, or teething, will have a more piercing cry along with a pained look.The more attuned you are to your baby’s needs and to what he/she is telling you, the more easily you’ll be able to soothe your baby.

, Babies who have colic tend to cry and to be in consistent discomfort from 2 weeks after they are born until 12-14 weeks past their due date. You can tell if your baby has colic if his/her cries are high-pitched, frantic, or sudden, and if he/she cries with a rigid or stiff body with clenched fists and a look of pain or anger on his/her face. After about 6 weeks, the colic should reach its height and should slowly taper off or even end abruptly after that. Though this can be a frustrating experience for parents and babies alike, you should know that it will pass.You can talk to a pediatrician about the colic, but unfortunately, there is no real cure. The most the doctor may do is to recommend gripe water or mylicon drops for your child. You will also be told to have patience, even if that’s not what you wanted to hear.
You can also talk to your doctor about other problems that could be causing your child to cry, such as your diet if you’re breastfeeding, acid reflux, or allergies to certain food.

, Though you may get frustrated with your baby from time to time, the worst thing you can do is to shake him/her. Even shaking your baby for just a few seconds can cause damage that cannot be undone. If you feel yourself truly losing patience with your child, take a few seconds or minutes to leave the room until you feel that you can safely return to your baby. If you have a real problem with anger toward your baby, see a doctor immediately to keep your baby safe.


Over 1000 babies die a year from Shaken Baby Syndrome. It is 100% preventable. Shaking your baby can lead to death, brain damage, mental disabilities, seizures, and even blindness.

, A common piece of advice for many women in older generations was to not rush in to soothe every cry--that the child needs to deal with it. But today's general advice is that children under 1 or so are crying because something is wrong. The baby is helpless, and looks to you for help. Ignoring the baby's cries with the idea that ""they will be spoiled if you do"" does no one any good.


Avoid letting your baby cry and cry, but sometimes you will find yourself unable to discover why the baby is crying. This can be upsetting to everyone. But the good news is that rarely do these episodes cause any lasting harm, either. Sometimes you never will find out why all the crying, and it is OK. Life goes on.
Sometimes you cannot immediately soothe a baby. Sometimes you cannot feed a baby immediately, or change his/her diaper, or give him/her attention. For example, you are driving home and cannot pull over to feed your baby. It may make him/her upset, but these situations occur and human babies will survive if you cannot drop everything immediately and remedy the situation.
If you are overwhelmed as a caregiver, when these crying jags occur it is OK to sometimes take a few minutes to yourself. Take a quick shower. Call your mother. These times can cause even the most loving mother or father to feel short-tempered. Sometimes stepping away for a few moments can really help you deal with this sort of situation.

, Popping in a pacifier when your baby is crying or upset may be a great temporary fix for your baby’s problems. And to be fair, many pediatricians are fine with moderate pacifier use. However, using it too much gets to be a bad habit to break later. And you, as caregiver, may not figure out what is really wrong..

, If your baby is crying and you try feeding him/her, give him/her a pacifier, going for a walk, and rocking him/her all in the same fifteen-minute span, then you may overwhelm her rather than make things better.


Try your calming methods one at a time until you have a strong sense of what really works. You may be surprised to find that you did not need to go outside or bring out that new toy all along.

, If it is near a typical feeding time, it is pretty likely your child is hungry. However, if you feed your baby whenever he/she cries, even if he/she is been recently fed, then this may lead him/her to look at food as the greatest source of comfort. This can lead to overeating and problems down the line.

Obtain your swaddling blanket.,
Fold the blanket for swaddling.,
Place you baby on the blanket.,
Make the first swaddle fold across the baby.,
Fold the bottom of the blanket.,
Make the last swaddle fold across the baby.,
Tuck in the loose corner.",How to Swaddle a Newborn," Be sure to use a cotton blanket that is at least 24 x 24 inches.This is the standard size for swaddling a nearly newborn baby. As the baby grows, you may need to use a larger blanket, about 40 x 40 inches.;
, Position the swaddling blanket on a flat surface such as carpeting or on a bed. Rotate the square blanket so the corners of the blanket are pointed up, down, and to the sides, or in a diamond shape, rather than being in the position of a normal square. Fold the top corner of the blanket down about eight inches.


If the baby is bigger, you are going to fold less of the top corner down. If the baby is smaller, you are going to fold the top corner down further.If you wish you can fold the folded fabric down one more time to make an approximate 2 inch ridge.This offers more neck support, but it’s not necessary.
The blanket should now look like a diamond or the Superman symbol.

, Place your baby in the center of the blanket, with the top of the baby’s shoulders right at the folded top., Hold the baby’s left hand and place it at his hip. Allow the baby’s elbow to be slightly bent.Take the left corner of the blanket, and bring it across the baby to his right side.


Allow his right arm to be free once you bring the blanket across to his right side.
Roll the baby to his left so you can tuck the blanket underneath his back.

, Grab the bottom corner of the swaddling blanket and bring it up toward the baby. The corner is going to be tucked behind the baby’s back, near her right shoulder.Make sure that the baby’s right arm is held down at her hip, again with her elbow slightly bent.

Don’t pull the bottom corner of the blanket too tight. You want the baby to have some mobility and freedom to kick her legs as they’re swaddled. However, you do want the blanket taut enough so when the baby does kick, she feels a little bit of resistance., Hold the blanket in place by lightly placing your hand on the baby’s chest. Use your other hand to grab the folded piece of blanket approximately five inches away from your baby’s neck.Bring this portion of the blanket over to the center of the baby’s chest to make a slight V-neck.Hold this V in place with your thumb.


Then pick up the last corner of the swaddling blanket (the right corner), and bring it across the baby and up to his left shoulder.Again, tuck the remaining blanket behind and underneath the baby’s back.

, With the last portion of the blanket wrapped around the baby, take the corner of the blanket, pull it horizontally across the baby’s back, and bring it over to the front of the baby’s right shoulder to tuck it into one of the blanket folds."

Know what not to do.",How to Soothe a Baby," The first thing you should do is to make sure your baby isn't hungry or tired. Babies run on about a 3 hour cycle. Eating about every 3 hours and sleeping about every 3 hours. Before you do anything else check the clock and determine if it has been about 3 hours since the last time they started eating or started sleeping. If baby needs to eat more often than this then they are probably not getting enough to eat at each feeding. If they are constantly ""snacking"" instead of eating full meals they won't sleep as long. If they are acting full try burping them mid feed and then offering more. Newborns eat and sleep, eat and sleep, eat and sleep. Less than 2 hours of sleep each cycle isn't healthy.


If baby isn't hungry or tired then check her diaper. If baby is still crying then she is hurting. This can range from mild discomfort, or feeling lonely, to severe pain. Often you will not be able to tell by the severity of the screams. Start checking for any thing that would cause them to be uncomfortable.;
,, Put baby to bed in a quiet dark room with some white noise (ie. fan). Give your baby more opportunities to rest and she may be less cranky.


Read ""Good Night, Sleep Tight: The Sleep Lady's Gentle Guide to Helping Your Child Go to Sleep, Stay Asleep, and Wake up Happy"" by Kim West. Even if you don't use her sleep techniques there are comprehensive explanations of how much sleep a child should be getting depending on age and descriptions of common sleep problems.

, Change diaper, preferably with warm wet wipes. Warm wipe by holding balled inside fist for 30 seconds.


Check for diaper rash every time you change her diaper. Prevent by promptly changing dirty diapers and carefully wiping inside all skin folds and creases. At the first sign of redness smear on some diaper cream (A&D ointment is a good all purpose fix and preventative for mild to severe skin irritations). Diaper rash can be as simple as minor skin irritation caused by rubbing of the wet diaper, an actual chemical burn from the urine interacting with something in the poop, or the start of an infection.
Girls can get urinary tract infections from improper wiping or sitting in poop too long. The first symptom is screaming when they pee. Drinking large amounts of cranberry juice will help flush the bacteria out of the urinary tract.
If baby already has a really painful rash and screams as you wipe, try laying them in a baby bath or on a folded towel and pouring or squirting warm water over her bottom to rinse as much off as possible without wiping. Pat the bottom dry and wipe only what is absolutely necessary. Glob on diaper cream or ointment instead of smearing it on with fingers since the wiping motion is the most painful.
Check the last time they pooped to make sure they aren't constipated. Has it been more than 24 hours? Give baby about an ounce of prune juice in a bottle, repeat in 12 hours if necessary.

,


Burp her and burp her again until you are sure there is no gas left. If baby seems excessively gassy think about switching formula (our NICU used Similac), you may need to switch to Soy-based or a special formulation for premature infants. If breast-feeding you may need to change your diet.
To burp your baby, hold the baby in your left arm, with the side of his/her face on your shoulder. Pat the back gently until you hear the baby burp. You can also rub the back from the bottom upward. There are additional burping positions if this doesn't work.
Perch baby on your knee, their face resting between your thumb and forefinger with your palm on their collarbone (fully supporting their head and neck with one hand). Place your other hand on their back with fingers supporting the back of their head. Gently and slowly sway baby back and forth. (similar to maneuvering air bubbles in an old fashioned bottle of soda around the constrictions in the middle of the bottle.
Lay baby face down across your lap and pat or rub their back.

, If your baby is acting in an alarming way, such as refusing to feed or sleep, then you should see a doctor immediately.

, If your baby is less than three months old, then the most common reason for him/her to be upset is because of a physical need.


Uncomfortable clothing. Check baby's clothes to make sure that they aren't pinching, itchy (tags or embellishments), twisted/bunched, too hot/cold, or otherwise making her uncomfortable. Change your laundry detergent and fabric softener to something with a lot less perfume if baby seems much more comfortable naked.
Changes in routine. Maybe you're taking him/her for a walk much earlier than usual and he/she doesn't like that. Maybe he/she's overwhelmed by all of the new visitors. Reacting really badly to changes can also be a sign she is tired, but if it persists as she gets older there could be something else going on.
Overwhelmed (especially for premature infants). Give the baby less stimulation if she is overwhelmed. Just ease up on all of the stimuli around your baby (too many visitors, loud TV, bright lights, phone ringing all the time, or too many toys in your baby's crib). Though babies can feel under stimulated and may want more love and attention, they can also have too much of a good thing and may just want to be left alone for a few minutes to rest and to be less stimulated.

, Your baby may also be crying just because she is feeling neglected or lonely. If your baby has been left alone for a while, or if you haven't made physical contact for a while, now is the time to hold, hug, kiss, or just play with your baby. Having her dad give her a big bear hug can also offer comfort.If baby seems to cry all the time and nothing helps then talk to your pediatrician about other potential problems that can be causing your baby to cry, such as food allergies, your diet if you're breast-feeding, or acid reflux.

, As you get to know your baby and she grows older, you may be able to tell the difference between different forms of crying. She may cry one way to show she's hungry and another to let you know she's wet. If you're able to distinguish between the different ways she cries, then this will make it easier for you to soothe your baby. Though every baby is different, here are some general rules to keep in mind:


A hungry baby tends to fuss quietly and to squirm. As she gets hungrier, the cries will escalate. However, a newborn baby's cries are loud right away.
A baby who is in pain, whether it's from teething, gas, or illness, then her cry will be more piercing and she'll have a pained look on her face.
At about 6 months if they wake at night you can often tell by the length of the crying. Wait 5-10 minutes and if they are still crying something is wrong other than they woke up.
Know if your baby has colic. Babies who have colic are known to cry and to be in consistent discomfort from about two weeks after birth until 12-14 weeks after the due date. Colic is characterized by high pitched, frantic crying, sudden crying, a rigid or stiff body with clenched fists, and a look of anger or pain on a baby's face. The colic can reach a height after the six week mark, and can taper off or suddenly end after that. Though it can be very frustrating and painful, it will end. Do not confuse this with acid reflux which causes actual pain. Acid reflux pain can be lessened by keeping baby in an upright or semi-reclined position (laying down makes the pain worse), feeding smaller amounts at meals, extra burping, and pressure on the tummy (lay baby face down over your lap and rub their back or face down over your arm with one leg on each side of your arm as you walk around.) , Even shaking your baby for a few seconds can permanently harm your child.


Don't be afraid to give yourself a time out. Put baby in the crib and walk away before you hurt them. Calm yourself down. This may involve putting your hands over your ears or shutting yourself in the bathroom so you can't hear them screaming.
If you can't stand it any longer, and are perhaps finding yourself in tears, call for help from a neighbor or a friend who has had children. They know what it's like to be in your shoes, and will be happy to do what they can. Don't be shy about asking them to come over.
As an absolute last resort, put the baby in the crib and call emergency services. Tell them you are losing your temper, that the baby won't stop crying, and that you need help immediately. They will send someone to ensure you don't hurt the child and refer you to social services so you will have someone to contact if the problem persists.
Over 1000 babies die a year from Shaken Baby Syndrome. Shaking your baby can lead to death, brain damage, intellectual disability, seizures, or even blindness.

, If the baby is a newborn, just home from the hospital, remember that the baby was warm and comfortable in the mother's womb. Wrapping or swaddling the baby, like a papoose, makes it feel like it did inside the womb: safe and warm. Buy a Sleepsack/Swaddler or use a small, lightweight receiving blanket to wrap the baby in. The concept is not to allow the baby to disturb himself/herself by flailing his/her arms or legs around. Just make sure that the baby is swaddled loosely enough that he/she can still comfortably breathe. Do not swaddle a pacifier in with your baby to avoid choking and make sure to place your baby down on his/her back when he/she is swaddled. Here's how you should go about swaddling your baby:.


Fold down one corner of the blanket and place the baby's head over this folded corner.
Wrap one side around the baby, pinning an arm down.
Take the point below baby's feet and pull it up and tuck it into the top of the blanket point that was tightly wound around.
Take the other side of the blanket and wrap it around the baby so that the baby cannot move the other arm

, Hold the baby at an angle to allow the baby to be on a side. Sometimes, all the baby needs is to change the way he/she is lying down to feel better. However, do not lay the baby in the crib to sleep on their side. Even a very young baby can roll over onto his/her stomach, which can increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

, Motion helps soothe babies, and makes them sleep. There are different forms of motion that work for different babies, and you can find what works best. Sometimes, you'll also have to think about what works best for you, because putting your baby in motion for a while can be tiring to new parents. Here are some ways to soothe your baby through motion:


Rock and/or bounce the baby in your arms.
Put the baby in a swing.
Lay the baby on your knees and gently swing him/her from side-to-side.
Pat gently on the baby's back.
Go for a walk.
Take the baby for a car ride.
Dance carefully with your baby in your arms or in a sling.
Walk around the room while holding your baby.
Sit on a medicine ball and gently bounce while holding your baby.
Hold your baby and rock back and forth in a rocking chair.

, If your baby is hungry, a breast or a bottle will be the best thing for him/her. But if your baby just wants something to suck on, you can give him/her a pacifier (if you're using those), put his/her thumb in his/her mouth, or even offer him/her your pinkie, nail side down. This can help the baby feel comforted during a challenging time.

, Sometimes, a new, comforting noise can be just the thing to soothe your upset baby. You can make the noise yourself or make the best of your surroundings. Here are some options that you can try:


Singing to your baby
Humming
Running a faucet
Turning on a white noise machine or saying ""shhh shhhh shhhh shhhh shhhh shhhh shhhh shhhh""
Playing soft music or nature sounds
Turn the radio on static
Turning on the vacuum

, Take off your shirt and strip baby to her diaper. Cuddle her on your chest with a soft warm blanket over both of you.


This technique has been known to stimulate lactation in under-producing women as well as providing something otherwise lacking in the development of premature infants.

, This can be the perfect soothing technique for some babies. It can relax them and get them ready for a nap or just help them feel less tense, just as a warm bath would help a stressed-out adult. You should test this out to see if it does, in fact, help your baby.


Unfortunately, some babies get more agitated after warm baths, so you need to find out whether this technique helps or hurts your baby.
Pay close attention to water temperature. Check it with your elbow. Some children are more sensitive to temperature than others. Some have a distinct preference for cool baths and others may like it overly warm.

, Giving your baby a gently passage with your fingers can help release the tension in his shoulders, arms, legs, and other parts of his/her body. Just a gentle, loving touch from a parent can also give your baby the love and attention he/she needs.


Just keep in mind that, like the warm bath, a massage can also agitate a baby instead of calming him/her down, so you should find out whether this is helpful for your baby.

, Sometimes, your baby just needs a change of scenery. The additional stimulation can give your baby something new to focus on instead of his/her own agitation. It doesn't require anything more elaborate than moving to a different room, if that's all you have energy for. Here are some other ways to change the scenery to help soothe your child:


Turn on the overhead fan.
Give your child a new toy to look at.
Move to your front porch or backyard.
Carry your baby toward the window and look out together.

, There are a few soothing strategies that may be great in the short term but which may lead to more trouble later on. Here are some things you should avoid:


Don't pop in a pacifier the second your baby is crying. It may offer temporary relief, but you may not be able to find out what's really wrong with your child.
Don't feed your baby the second she starts crying. There are many reasons for a baby to be upset, and if you always try feeding first, then the baby may get used to the idea that food is always the best comfort, which can lead to overeating.
Don't try too many methods of stimulation for your baby. It can take a few minutes to figure out what works best for your child, and if you try eight different strategies in the same half hour, you will likely end up overwhelming and overstimulating your child.

Pre-planning.,
If, for some reason, there is no, ""dad"" available to help out with planning and advice, One should designate a special male friend or family member.,
Talk to him about what he would want/like for the shower.,
If it's a surprise shower, definitely get dtb involved in the planning as much as possible.

,
Send out ""Couples Baby Shower"" invitations!,
Make sure dtb knows all the important information off the top of his head (he will be asked): Date, time and specific location of shower; where the gift registry(s) is/are; etc.

,
Plan your decorating scheme with the guys in mind.,
Include man-friendly foods in your menu.,
Avoid, ""Baby Shower Games."",
If you must have games, don't make the men feel they must participate.",How to Throw a Co Ed Baby Shower," If you are the Mom-to-be (mtb), or the designated party-planner, make sure Dad-to-be (dtb) can and will attend. If he is not interested (and excited), it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to entice the other guys to show up.;
, Preferably, choose someone who will be excited about the party, will actively participate in planning, and who you know will really encourage male guests to show up and have a great time.

, What are his tastes? Also, what he would definitely NOT like. If he won't like it, the other men probably won't either.

,, If purchasing invitations look specifically for couples or co-ed baby shower invitations which feature graphics and text that clearly indicate that couples are invited. If DIY, be sure to clearly indicate that it's a couples shower and that the dtb will be attending. Address the envelopes to both the male and female guests to make it clear who is invited.

,, Don't go too crazy with lacy, loopy, flowery decorations, invitations, and gift bags; even if baby's a girl! Keep things simpler than you normally would.

, Keep Mom-to-be's restricted diet in mind, but don't expect the guys to be happy with fresh fruit and punch. Again, dtb's opinion is a big help here!

, Nothing makes some guys catch 'baby shower flu' faster than the threat he'll be caught up in potentially embarrassing games. Instead, have a diaper raffle (every guest brings a bag of diaper bags and gets a raffle ticket), and make sure the prizes are guy-friendly; or other male-appropriate activities. You may have to clarify with the men ahead of time that there won't be games, to help raise their comfort-level. Dtb can be very helpful with this.

, Instead, provide a place for hasty retreat where the guys can hang, and avoid feeling uncomfortable.

,, Depending on what time of day and season the shower will take place (and the mom-to-be's preference of course), you can begin to plan the menu. Finger foods are most common and generally the easiest to create. Other easy foods include salads, cupcakes and baked goods purchased from a reputable bakery.

, One area for the food, one area to eat the food, an area near the entrance for guests to place their coats, purses and gifts (also makes it easy to haul the gifts out after opened).

, Games are a great way to pass the time. Have no less than three games and no more than five. Some people do not enjoy games but want to be polite and play them in order to participate, but try to let such people do something else if they're not keen.


Estimate how much time each game will take to ensure that you are not running over time with the schedule.
For each game you play, you will need a small gift for the winner!

Pack everything into your car and take it to the location. Haul it all in and assemble what's left to be assembled.
Put décor up. Hang pictures of the sonograms, baby pictures of mom and dad and all other decorations such as balloons, streamers, table cloths and center pieces.

If you're not sure who exactly should be invited, ask the new mom's sister or mother, or someone else who's close to her and can help you make sure no one who should be invited is left out.;
, There are many great ideas for invitations, from fill-in-the-blank, store bought cards, to computer generated and personalized invites. If you have the budget, sending a mini baby bottle with the party info is unique and cute. You could also get plain white boxes and decorate as baby blocks, with the information inside. The sky is the limit!









You don't have to send invitations through the mail; e-invites work just as well, and they come in many cute designs.
Make your own invitations by buying pink and blue cardstock and handwriting or printing the information on them. Include pink and blue confetti in the envelope.

, Make it clear that the event is a baby shower and be sure to include the name of the person it's being held for. In addition to these essential details, include the following info:









The date of the shower.
The place where it's being held.
The start and end times.
Information about where the new mom is registered (this is only considered acceptable if you are not related to the mother. If you are related to her, it's not polite. You can also have registry information ready to give in print or over the phone, should anyone ask where the mom-to-be has registered).
RSVP information or a regrets-only request, so you know who's coming. Give a date by which you'd like to hear whether people can make it.

, Give people plenty of time to mark their calendars and plan ahead. You'll probably start receiving RSVPs within a few days.

Buy 2 pounds of long-grain rice.,
Purchase a package of 100 safety pins.,
Find a large bowl or a gallon-sized plastic bag.,
Mix the rice and safety pins in the bowl or bag.,
Place the bowl or bag in a safe location until you are ready to play.,
Blindfold the first player.,
Set a timer to one minute.,
Instruct the play to find as many safety pins in the rice as she can, using only her hands.,
Count and record the number of safety pins once the minute is up.,
Place the safety pins back in the rice and let the next player go.,
Check your records to see who found the most safety pins.,
Clean up afterwards.",How to Play the Rice Game for Baby Showers," The first item that's required for the rice game is a large bag of rice, weighing approximately 2 pounds. Using long-grain rice will make the game slightly more challenging, but any type of rice will do.


The rice does not need to be cooked in order to play this game, so cooking time is irrelevant.
Keep in mind that you will not be able to eat the rice after using it for this game, so buy the cheapest rice available.;
, The next thing you need is a package of 100 safety pins. The type of safety pins you buy will depend on your personal preference:


Using small safety pins will make the game harder, using large safety pins will make the game easier, and using a mixture of large and small pins will make the game more interesting.
Open the packet of safety pins and spread them on a table to make sure all of them are securely closed. Having open safety pins is a bad idea as someone could prick their finger during the game.

, Next, you will need to find something to put the rice and safety pins into. This could be a large plastic bowl (not glass) or a gallon-sized, sealable plastic bag.


The plastic bowl is easier to use, as you will quickly be able to place the rice and safety pins inside. However, there is a higher chance that you or one of your guests might knock the bowl over and spill its contents.
The plastic bag is slightly more awkward to set up, but you will be able to seal it until you are ready to play the game. This reduces the chances of the rice spilling and making a mess.

, Pour the entire bag of rice and all of the closed safety pins into the bowl or bag and use your hands or a large spoon to mix them thoroughly.Once this is done, you can seal the plastic bag or cover the bowl with a lid or piece of cling wrap.

, Set the bowl or bag aside until you are ready to play the rice game. Try to place it in a safe location where it is unlikely to be knocked over.

, To begin the game, blindfold the first player. You can use a sleep mask or any piece of thick, dark cloth. Tie the blindfold securely over the players eyes and make sure they can't see through it.


If the player would prefer not to be blindfolded, you can just ask them to close their eyes while they play instead.
Alternatively you could place the bowl or bag of rice underneath a coffee table and ask the player to sit in such a way that she can reach the bowl but can't see its contents.

, Use an egg timer or stopwatch to count down one minute on the clock. One person can be responsible for alerting the player when their time starts and when their time is up.

, During her one minute, the first player needs to use her hands to find as many safety pins in the rice as possible. Once she finds one, she should remove it from the bowl or bag and set it on the table beside her.

, Once the minute is up, the player must immediately stop looking for safety pins. You should then count the safety pins to see how many she found and record that number (along with the player's name) on a piece of paper., Before the next person plays, it's important to place all of the safety pins back into the bowl or bag of rice and mix them up.


This ensures that there is the same amount of safety pins in each round, which gives all of the players an equal chance.
Once the safety pins are mixed back in, allow the next player to take their turn.

, Continue around the room until each guest has taken a turn at collecting the safety pins. Then compare all of the players' scores to see who found the most.


If you like, you can award a small prize to the winner of the game. This could be a scented candle, a picture frame, a small box of chocolates, etc.You could also award a prize to the players who came second and third, or even to the player who found the least amount of safety pins. Your game, your rules!

, As each player removes safety pins from the bowl or bag of rice, it's likely that a number of rice grains will fall onto the floor. As a result, you may have a certain amount of cleaning up to do after the game.


If you wish the use the safety pins in future, remove them all from the bowl of rice and place them back in their original packet.
Use a vacuum cleaner to vacuum up any grains of rice that have fallen on the floor, then throw away the rice remaining in the bowl or bag.

Select a theme for the shower.,
Create your own decorations.,
Make a memorable centerpiece for your refreshment or gift table.",How to Throw a Baby Shower2," Choose a character from a fairy tale, children's book, or cartoon. You could also choose baby animals, flowers, butterflies, or another fun, light-hearted theme. Find a party store in your area or search discount stores or the internet for plates, tablecloths, napkins, banners, balloons, favors and so on to match your theme or colors. Decorative plates and napkins look so cute on the refreshment table.









Matching the theme to the baby's nursery is a special idea that the mother-to-be will enjoy.
If the sex of the baby is unknown, you could do a simple pink and blue theme.

, Streamers and helium balloons around the room and on the gift and refreshment tables are very festive and inexpensive to put up yourself. Baby playthings such as rubber duckies, stuffed animals, or blocks make great decorative accents to place around the room. Welcome guests and the mother-to-be to the shower in a special way with a baby shower banner and balloons at the shower entrance. If you have a Publisher program on your computer you may be able to make a banner yourself.









Dollar stores are excellent places to pick up inexpensive items.
You may also want to look into renting a lawn stork with a sign announcing the anticipated arrival of the baby.
Another idea is to place a framed photo of the parents-to-be on the gift table for a personal touch.
Be sure to provide the mother-to-be with her own special chair next to the gifts and mark it by tying a unique balloon to it (or a sash announcing her Soon To Be status...she could even wear this while opening gifts!).

, Start with an inexpensive basket in natural, white, or another color that matches the shower colors. Place a stuffed animal, doll or other item that coordinates with the shower theme into the basket and then place a baby bottle or rattle in front of the animal or doll. Attach a decorative bow to the the basket handle and tie 4-5 pastel helium balloons to the top of the basket handle. Place the decorated centerpiece in the middle of the refreshment or punch table and sprinkle around some baby shower confetti.









As a special gift, give the decorative centerpiece to the mother to be as a memento of her baby shower or to display in the baby's nursery.

Diaper Cakes also make very cute and functional centerpieces and double as a baby gift. You can make one yourself or find a diaper cake company that will create one that matches your shower theme.
A simple fresh floral arrangement featuring the shower colors makes an elegant and appropriate centerpiece as well.

"
"
Decide on the menu.,
Prepare fruit punch and drinks.,
Buy or make a cake.",How to Throw a Baby Shower3," Prepare a variety of snacks and desserts for your menu. You could simply have cake and punch or you can prepare a more elaborate spread. If your shower falls during lunch or dinner time you may want to provide a more substantial menu than just dessert.









Finger foods are easy to prepare and the choice of finger foods is endless. Pigs-in-a blanket, miniature ham biscuits, mini quiches, assorted finger sandwiches of meat and cheese or chicken/egg salad croissants are always great options.
Prepare either a fruit or fresh vegetable tray and serve with a delicious dip. Strawberries and grapes make good fruit selections because they require no cutting up.
You can round out your shower menu with small snack items such as chips n dip, snack mix, assorted cubed cheeses and crackers, nuts, mints or whatever else you can think of that your guests would like. If you have a specialty dish or dessert, make it for the shower.

, Make your own punch using sherbet and ginger ale, or buy a prepared frozen punch starter from the ice cream section of your grocery store and simply add ginger ale. Float a couple of small rubber duckies in the punch bowl for a truly fun accent! Serve the punch in goblets for a more elegant touch. You will probably want to have some chilled bottled water, coffee or diet drinks available for guests who would prefer.








, Cake is a baby shower staple. Special ordering a cake for a group can be expensive, so baking your own cake or cupcakes from a box mix and canned icing then decorating them with simple colored candy sprinkles or decorative cupcake picks is a less costly option.









Display your decorated cupcakes by placing them on a footed cake plate scattered with candy sprinkles and add a cute figurine or rubber ducky in the center.
A cheesecake sampler is a good alternative to your standard cake, especially for a small number of guests. These are found in most supermarket bakeries.

"
"
Plan a variety of games.,
Provide favors.",How to Throw a Baby Shower4," Games are a good way to get the guests involved and break the ice. A mix of active and written games is good. You can create your own written games such as ""Unscramble the Baby Words"",""Match the Baby to the Celebrity Mother"", or see how many words you can make out of the mother and father's names. Remember to supply pens or pencils to your guests for written games. Prizes can be inexpensive items such as candles, scented lotions, boxes of candy, cute stationary, gift cards or lottery tickets.









Some more active games are ""Baby Hot Potato"" where you pass a baby doll around a circle while you play a lullaby. Whoever is holding the baby when the music stops is out. Keep going until one person is left.
Baby bingo is fun and can be found at most party stores or you can get creative and make your own cards with a computer. This is played like regular bingo except the numbers are replaced with baby related words.
For ""Diaper a Doll while Blind-folded"" all you need is a doll, a diaper and safety pins and a dark blind-fold.
""Baby Bottle Drink-off"" is a hilarious game."" Put about an ounce of punch, water or some other drink in baby bottles and have party participants race to drink their bottle. First person to finish wins.
Another really fun game that will be memorable is ""Baby Sculptures"". Assign each participant a baby related item such as bottle, pacifier, baby's first tooth, or another small item and have them make it out of Playdoh. The person who guesses the most correct sculptures wins.

, Have a few party favors to send home with the shower attendees. Chocolate kisses or pastel candies wrapped in colored tulle and tied with ribbon along with a personalized tag make classic and low cost favors. Design and print your own tags using your computer.









A really fun and original favor that doubles as a game are scratch off tickets that are printed with the mother-to-be's name and shower date. Each person gets a ticket to scratch off with one ticket as a winner. Guests who don't win still have a personalized keepsake from the shower.

Select colors that complement the colors of your shower theme and your tablescape.;
, Hosta leaves or wide tulip or daylily leaves make good choices.

,,, Work with the bouquet until you achieve a pleasing arrangement.

,, You want the tissue to touch the base of the blooms and wrap loosely around the stems to cover the wire or rubber band.

, A ribbon printed with a baby design will make the bouquet more personalized. You can also attach a miniature baby shower favor to the ribbon.

, You may need to trim your stems with pruning shears so that the bouquet will be the correct height.

, Tuck the cards into the bouquet.

, Alternatively, place the bouquets on a table near your door so that each guest can take one when he or she leaves.

Redirect the child.,
Say “yes.” Sometimes just saying the word “no” can cause a young child to fall apart or have a temper tantrum.,
Eliminate temptation.,
Try humor.",How to Practice Gentle Discipline1," You can use gentle discipline if you channel a child’s attention away from something negative or harmful and to something appropriate.Sometimes you can prevent a problem from occurring by shifting the child’s focus a bit.


For example, you might tell a toddler, “We don’t knock those over. But, here are some blocks you can knock over.”
Or, you might take a book that a child is drawing on and say, “We write on paper, not on books. Here’s some blank paper for you.”;
, You can prevent problems and practice gentle discipline by responding to children with affirmative statements when possible.


For example, you’ve just started cooking and your cranky child wants to know if dinner is soon. You might say, “Yes, I know you’re hungry. We’ll be eating as soon as we can. Why don’t you help me?”
Or, for instance, if they want to know if they can have some candy, you could tell them, “Yes, you can. Right after we finish eating our meals.”

, Another way to say yes and prevent problems is by removing objects that you might have to tell children not to touch or to leave alone.When you practice gentle discipline this way you don’t give young children the opportunity to get into certain types of trouble.


For example, putting away your glass vase protects your property and keeps you from having to say “no” or “stop.”
Try replacing the things children can’t have with things they can interact with. For instance, you might want to put your porcelain squirrel collection in storage and replace them temporarily with alphabet magnets.

, Toddlers and young children are excellent at escalating a situation from peaceful and calm to hectic and frustrating in an instant. One way to prevent problems with young children when you are practicing gentle discipline is to lighten the mood a bit.Humor can help calm a young child, as well as you. It can also help you redirect a child.


You don’t have to tell an elaborate joke. With toddlers and young children you can even make a funny face to break the tension.
Try answering the child in a funny voice. For instance, you might try a nasally twang when you say, “A toy? You want a new toy? Well, let’s talk about that.”

Choose the safest route possible.,
Walk the route with your child before sending your child alone.,
Identify safe houses along the route.,
Teach your child to cross only at intersections and to look both ways before crossing the street.

,
Arrange for your child walk with another child if possible.,
Brief your child on how to respond to strangers who they might encounter.

,
Have your child bring a phone if the route is lonely, particularly if no buddy is available.

,
Make sure your child knows how to dial for emergency help.,
Teach your child about special seasonal hazards.",How to Prepare your Child to Walk Home from School," Choose a route with sidewalks if you can, and which crosses very few, if any, busy streets. If there is a construction project in progress on one street, make a route which avoids the construction, even if this will result in a longer walk.;
, If the route is difficult to remember, or if the child is very young, you may want to walk the route several times together before the child has to walk alone. Do this before the first day of school, or plan on meeting your child for the first few days of school.

, Point out the homes of family friends where the child might stop for help in case of trouble. Quiz the child as you pass these homes so that they will learn to recognize the right homes.

,, Walking with a buddy will be helpful to your child in case any emergency should occur.

,,, Put on speed dial the local emergency number in your area, as well as that of yourself and the other relatives or friends you know will be available to help your child if the need arises.

, There are some hazards that only arise in particular seasons. One important hazard is to warn children to keep well away from snow clearing vehicles. If children see snow clearing of a bank at the edge of a street crossing, tell your children to stand well back until the snow plough or vehicle has left. Children have come to grief by falling under such equipment as it is being used and it is often impossible for the driver to see children in this situation. Another big danger is storm water drains filling quickly during rainy weather. Make sure that your children understand that it is never OK to cross such drains or play in them. In some regions, these drains can fill very quickly without warning and even strong swimmers cannot escape the swirling water.

"
Manage your own emotions.,
Avoid shaming the child.,
Establish clear expectations and consequences.,
Encourage your child to reflect.,
Be consistent.,
Acknowledge their feelings.",How to Practice Gentle Discipline2," Young children can do things that are amazing and frustrating at the same time. You should make sure that you are in control of your emotions when you are practicing gentle discipline.Losing control of your emotions can scare young children and make it hard for them to connect with you.


Check your emotions and see how you are feeling. Ask yourself, “How does this make me feel?
Wait until you are calm before you discipline a child. Avoid any type of discipline if you are angry, stressed, tired, or anxious.
Take a walk or leave the room if you need to and can do so without leaving the young children alone.
If you are somewhere that you can’t leave, like a moving vehicle, then take a mental time out.
Take a few deep breaths to calm yourself by inhaling and exhaling slowly and deeply a few times.

, A key part of practicing gentle discipline is showing children respect.Your act of gentle discipline should come from a place of love, and not from a stance of shame or anger. You can do this and connect with children if you make an effort to avoid doing or saying things that could embarrass them or make them feel bad about themselves.


Use positive language and encouragement. For example, you might tell a young child, “I’m proud of how you calmed yourself down just now.”
Avoid calling children ‘bad,’ ‘mean,’ or other negative things that might harm their developing self-esteem.
Remember to separate the children from their actions. You can try saying things like, “I love you, but I don’t like what you did.”
Discipline should never involve a parent personally attacking a child with shame, guilt, or anger.
If you have more than one child, do not compare one child with their siblings as an attempt to correct their misbehavior, or an attempt to motivate or threaten them.

, It can be confusing for a child when they don’t know how they should behave or what will happen when they misbehave. Think consequences through carefully before executing them. Determine if you are trying to teach, correct, guide, or punish your child. Identify what it is you are trying to accomplish with your child when she misbehaves.


Reflect before you execute your gentle discipline, instead of reacting quickly within the moment. Allowing for these factors will help you become a more effective parent.
Consider natural consequences. For example, if your child throws their plate of food on the floor, a natural consequence is that they will have to wait to eat and will have to eat what’s available.
Make sure the consequences are age or developmentally appropriate. For instance, it may not be appropriate to make a toddler clean up a major mess.

, By encouraging your child to think and reflect about their behavior, it allows them to learn and understand their behavior, the consequences that are involved, and to think about what they could have done and will do differently in the future. Encourage this type of reflection by asking them open ended questions.

For example, “Josh, can you think about and tell me why throwing the ball at another person without their approval is wrong?” or “Josh, do you think you can give me an example of what we should do next time to be safe?”

, One of the keys to effective discipline of any kind is that it is consistent.This is because it allows young children to know what to expect. It keeps discipline from seeming arbitrary to the child. When you are practicing gentle discipline you also need to be consistent with your consequences and responses to inappropriate behavior.


Your response to a child’s behavior should be immediate. For instance, you should address back-talking when it occurs, not later when you get home.
Some behaviors are unacceptable in any setting or situation. For example, name-calling or acts of physical aggression should always have an immediate consequence.
When possible, establish consistent expectations between different caregivers. For example, make sure you and the child’s other caregivers all agree that yelling is not okay.

, Listening to children and showing them that you understand how they feel about a situation can help you practice gentle discipline. This helps children feel respected and teaches them how to identify and handle difficult emotions appropriately.Ask them how they feel about the situation. For example, you could say, “How did that make you feel inside?”
Tell the child that you understand how they feel and how difficult it can be to feel that way. For example, you might say, “I know how disappointed you are that we can’t go. It can be hard when you feel this way.”
Offer suggestions for ways that they can appropriately express their feelings. You could tell them, “When I’m disappointed, I think of something happy or funny.”

"
"
Demonstrate how to express emotions.,
Be honest.,
Make the most of teachable moments.",How to Practice Gentle Discipline3," You can practice gentle discipline if you use your own feelings and the way you express them as a way to model appropriate behavior for young children. Showing children how to handle their emotions can help improve their self-control and show them how to problem solve in difficult situations.Talk about what you’re feeling, why you feel that way, and how you can handle it. For instance, if you are in traffic with your preschooler, you might think out loud, “I’m stressed because of the traffic. I need to do something to calm down.”
Let children know when you are using relaxation strategies to calm down. For example, you might tell them, “I’m going to take some deep breaths to calm down.”

, When you make a mistake or do something wrong, admit it. Being honest about your mess-ups will help you practice gentle discipline. It shows young children that everyone makes mistakes and the appropriate way to handle it when you do.Admit it to young children when you do something wrong. For instance, you might say, “I didn’t mean to, but I broke Mark’s mug.”
Tell the child how you will make the situation better. For example, you could tell them, “I need to apologize to him and buy him a new one to replace it.”

, These are moments that occur in everyday situations that can be used to teach a disciplinary lesson. You can practice gentle discipline if you make the most of these opportunities to provide moral guidance and set a good example.


Young children are always paying attention. Whenever you are around them, think of yourself as a teacher or model.
Talk to young children about images they see in the media of people expressing their emotions. Talk about whether what they see is an appropriate or inappropriate way to act.

Think of some really fun games you have played at parties you have been to.,
Now think about the crowd you are gathering for this very special event.,
It is time to get to work as you are in a very good mood.,
Think outside the box for some games and activities that will delight your guests.",How to Play Fun Games at the Baby Shower1," Not just baby showers, mind you. Look back on the parties, slumber parties, housewarming parties, etc. Think about the sentimental and memorable games and activities you did as a guest at those events. Let your party memories guide you on your quest.;
, Think about the parents-to-be. Remember that this is a celebration of the new life about to enter the world. Capture that moment and go forward with the spirit of sentiment, fun and memories to be made.

, You will want to pick about 5 games and activities, in total. I would choose two classic games. Examples would be: baby bingo, baby word jumble, celebrity/baby match up, how big around is mother, or blindfolded diaper changing.

, You may just want to let those inspire you to create your own games. Think ""Celebrate Baby"". Otherwise, there are some lists given below. Think about how excited you and the guests and the new parents are to see this little one in a few months. Think outside the box.

Teach you child communication skills.,
Create a peaceful and encouraging environment.,
Be your child's role model.,
Practice routine.,
Establish daily routine.,
Practice freedom.,
Practice love.,
Follow creative life flow.,
Cultivate relationships.,
Know what to do if your child misbehaves.",How to Practice Conscious Parenting," Babies learn words before birth. Research has shown that babies can recognize words they heard in the womb, and that they remember voices. The most important idea here is to talk and explain about things around all the time, regardless age. If there is noise, tell your baby what it comes from; show and try new food together; draw and craft, dance and walk.


During communication, the tone and attitude should not sound distant, sarcastic, degrading or impatient. Be confident, calm and loving. This is your first opportunity to teach your baby how to respond to the world. In listening to you, he absorbs essential emotional memories he will use to react to life in the future. Instill values. Show that kindness, honesty, courage, respect, confidence and patience can help in any situation.;
, Since your baby absorbs all information and words the way a sponge takes water, you have to create a safe and peaceful environment. This gives him the opportunity to learn and explore the world freely and fearlessly. If one of the parents is stressed out, or both of them do not get along well, exposing him to this “input” will deeply influence the baby. He can develop phobias or concepts that lead to adverse consequences.


To develop a child who will build peace and respect in his house later, there should be peace and respect in the house now. Moreover, the environment should encourage your baby to learn and explore. It is better if a child listens to different styles of music, hears other languages, sees various types of painting, has pens and colors to draw, books to see, and tools to craft as early as possible.

, If you do not prove or behave according to your words, nobody will take you seriously. That is especially the case with children. They often say, “But you do not do this, so why should I?” Parents have to obey their own words and be consistent. If they contradict themselves, their efforts will never work, but instead will annoy and confuse. You might think that your baby is too small to understand this, but that is not so. Your child will copy you. First he will repeat your behavior, then your words.

, We all need routine in our food consumption, in our sleep patterns, in our cleanliness and our exercise regime. This routine does not come naturally and it is learned and exercised from very young age. Not only will it help you to manage the household, but kids also grow up happier without the stress of unpredictability. Moreover, your routine can be planned to give you the opportunity to have a “free time,” so to speak. It is a carefully structured activity and should be rigorously followed. The routine includes:


Regular bedtime, regular mealtime, regular washing time, a set time for silence, a set time for creativity, a set time for play.
The routine around food – at a set time, and place.
The routine around ‘spaces’ – dining at the dining table, playing in the playing room, doing the home-work after school, etc. With the set routine, your children will feel safe and 'at home' within their lives.

, Establishing a daily routine will save you from the mayhem you plunge into when you have a baby. As soon as you know the physiological and emotional habits of your child, you can set up a daily schedule, i.e., within the first 6 weeks.

, Exploring, experiencing and imitating the world of grown-us through free play, children are given a chance to subconsciously learn and emotionally mature through their own games. Too much of today’s learning is structured; children are ‘directed’, ‘instructed’ and carefully ‘followed’ at all times, so they do not have a chance to experience learning through unobstructed observation.

, Children need to feel love at all times: love gives them confidence that they are heard, that they are present, and that they matter. A warm, loving and gentle environment gives children a wonderful start to life. Children perceive their parents' emotions and map them, so if the parent is angry, they will be frightened or chaotic.

, Objects of play should be as simple as possible, to allow the power of imagination to flourish. Buying ‘perfect’, expensive toys robs the children of an ability to see beauty in a stone or a shell. Freedom should be an integral ingredient of your child’s growth.


Go to a park or a beach and do not hurry, let your child play, be, experiment. Try not to interfere, let them be children, let them discover, explore, and invent their objects of play.
Allow your child to cook, wash dishes, take care of plants, and take care of animals: these activities are extremely interesting for a child because they can act as grown-ups.
Let your children play with others. Children also learn beautifully when with other children, they learn not to scream, shout or hit, because other children at all times challenge their emotional make-up.

, Cultivate loving relationships within your family, with your neighbors, friends, with the Earth and its inhabitants. Have in mind that you are not alone, that you are a part of a bigger 'picture' that will become your children's future. The development of thoughts should go hand in hand with the development of feelings and heart. Children have a beautiful capacity for feelings that will later in life give them a rich soul experiences.

, If baby misbehaves – distract him, wash his face or give a pacifier. The rule of thumb is that if your baby starts crying, asking for something that he should not get, or just misbehaving – distract him. Try taking baby to the window to show them what's going on outside, and it may calm you child down and make them forgets their concerns. Do not let babies cry until they get what they want. It is a kind of blackmail kids will use against you constantly in the future if you do not stop them now. Just distract their attention; they have a really short memory.The other tricks can be used include washing baby's face. Somehow that helps, and, of course, a pacifier is the number-one calming device.

After the gifts have been opened....surprise the parents with a scavenger hunt for these fun and unique items!!,
""In the crib you thought baby would sleep but there will be many nights you'll be up with baby watching TV.,
We have all been to so many baby showers.",How to Play Fun Games at the Baby Shower4," Before the shower you will want to hide these items in rooms that won't be accessed during the party. Have the clues written on parchment paper rolled up and secured with ribbon. The first clue will be handed to the parents (or mommy) the remaining clues will be hidden with each item as it is found.

, In your comforting arms she (he) will want to be cuddled. Underneath this gift you can both be huddled. There is something for baby and something for mom. Something for daddy and something for all."" (now the hostess will add a clue revealing where the gift is hidden example: hidden in a room at the top of the stairs, take a sharp left, open the door, it is there!). Hidden in this room could be a Moses Basket with A Soft Throw blanket and A DVD of a television series mom or dad really likes and a CD to dance with baby to that mother or father likes!)

, Or even if we haven't, the guests invited have. As hostesses it is our duty to make a great memory for the new mommy and daddy. One of the greatest gifts a hostess gives the new parents is this great gathering of people who have nothing but love for them and the new little one. By putting in some original thought and obvious mental effort....you are sure to delight your guests and create an atmosphere of sentiment and excitement. Do not be afraid to be original. Do not feel that you must adhere to some ""preordained"" to-do list for this celebration. Only you know these people the way that you do. You have chosen to organize this wonderful celebration and make it special. Make a memory!!


Good luck and celebrate with your baby!

If you have a garden of your own that you want to show off, have the party at your house. Otherwise, you might consider booking an ivy-covered patio at a restaurant, or contacting local botanical gardens to see if they have event space.You may also consider asking close family members or friends with nice outdoor space if they would be willing to let you host the event there.If you know weather will be a concern based on the seasons where you live, consider looking for a covered patio with heat lamps, or otherwise choosing an indoor space at a venue that incorporates lots of plant life.;
, If your party is going to be in an outdoor garden, make plans in advance for non-ideal weather conditions. Rent a tent or cover in case of rain or snow, and consider renting a few outdoor heaters to prepare for dips in temperature if you live in an area that gets cold.Ask your venue if they can make any of this available to you at an additional charge.
If you are hosting at home or your venue cannot supply these items, most party rental companies can help you set up weather preparations.

, Once you know when and where you will have the party, start thinking about who you want there, and what you want to request of your guests. Decide whether you want only female friends in attendance, or if you want to welcome friends of different genders, as well as their partners. This is also the time to consider whether you want to implement a dress code, as well choosing whether you want attendees to bring gifts.For a garden-themed baby shower, requesting garden attire is not only appropriate, it can help your guests properly plan an outfit for the venue so they can avoid things like getting heels stuck in the grass.Decide in advance if you want guests to bring gifts, or if you would rather have them do something like donate to a charity. Knowing this in advance will allow you to specify on your invitations.

, Have thematic colors picked out before you start shopping for decorations or food. Pastel yellows, greens, blues, purples, and pinks, as well as ivory and cream colors are all common for garden-themed events. Consider selecting a primary color, a secondary color, and a light neutral such as cream or white to start. You may also want to bring in a dark neutral such as gray or brown, or a metallic like gold as an accent.Tradition holds that blues are typically associated with having a boy, while pinks are commonly associated with having a girl. You are welcome to follow these traditions if you would like, but making use of both blue and pink is appropriate for a garden shower, regardless of the baby’s gender.

, You may choose to cook for the shower yourself, or you may have the shower catered. You don’t need to have a menu finalized, but two to three months before the shower you should know whether you want it to be catered or home cooked. This gives you enough time to try and book a caterer, should you so choose.Garden parties lend themselves well to tea service as well as light hors d'oeuvres, both of which are easy to prepare at home if you wish., Invitations, RSVP cards, and any other paper goods including place cards and tags for gifts are an easy way to bring garden themes into your party. Look at a local craft or paper goods store to find floral, leafy, or vegetal prints for your paper goods.Working with a paper goods store generally costs a little more, but they can help you pick complimentary prints in the right sizes for different pieces. They can also typically help you design the text for and print your paper goods.
You may also be able to design and order your invitations and paper goods online and save a little money versus working with a traditional print shop.

, Centerpieces are another great way to bring plant life into your decor. For a more formal shower, you may consider arranging flowers in vases or having low-lying bouquets spread out across the table. For more of a rustic theme, you might consider putting live plants such as ferns, hydrangeas, or daisies in old watering cans or terra cotta pots with ribbons. You can even use moss to cover up any potting soil and bring more greenery into the space.You can add some artificial butterflies and dragonflies to your arrangement to bring some life into your pieces.You may also consider floating candles in flower pots and bird baths as accents around the space., Burlap is a wonderful fabric for garden parties because it is frequently used to wrap exposed roots and thus is often seen in gardens and nurseries. Purchase some burlap from your local fabric store and add lace or ribbon to the edges to create table runners and placemats.Get an easy, no-sew table runner with lace edges by folding over the frayed sides of burlap. In the crease, place a fusible webbing, and iron down the length to get clean edges. Then, use the webbing along the sides again to fuse the lace to the burlap., You may opt to keep your place settings simple by picking solids within your color scheme, or you may choose place settings with floral or leafy patterns. One simple trick to make a coordinated table is to use white or cream dishes with a plastic charger in one of your accent colors. Finish it all off with napkin holders that have flowers or leaves on them.You may decide to have small potted plants such as a single flower or a succulent in a terracotta pot with your guests’ names written on them. These can serve as place cards and favors.
Decide early whether you want to buy or rent stoneware, or whether you would prefer to use disposable dishes and flatware. If you want to use stoneware, start shopping early to make sure you can get enough to fit your whole party.

, Buntings made of scrap fabric and oversized paper flowers make excellent wall decor for garden parties. Buntings are easy to hang on fences outside, while paper flowers can help bring some of the garden indoors.You can also make garlands out of real flowers, fake flowers, or leaves to string around the space. Wrap them with fairy lights for some ambient lighting if your event will go into the evening.
If you do not want to make wall decor, you may instead choose to buy decor including already-made paper flowers and wall decals with garden themes such as florals, birds, and insects.
Look in the garden or yard section of your local home improvement store for additional yard decor you can use to give your party more personal touches., Afternoon teas and garden parties go hand-in-hand. Consider making a few types of hot or iced teas along with some finger sandwiches, fresh fruit, and pastries such as scones.For a more formal party, consider using dessert and cake stands to display your food. For a more informal gathering, you could organize your foods on cute trays and themed platters.
Consider buying or renting a beverage dispenser for large amounts of iced tea. For hot tea, you may opt for either teapots or insulated beverage dispensers, depending upon how much you anticipate needing.
Easy and delicious finger sandwich choices include cucumber sandwiches, smoked salmon on toast, herbed cream cheese and strawberry sandwiches, egg and chicken salad sandwiches, and more., Brunch also works very well with garden-themed parties. Plan your favorite brunch foods like quiche, fruit salad, fresh pastries, and more. You can even consider letting guests build their own omelettes or have a waffle bar with toppings from fruit to candy and plenty of fresh whipped cream.If you are having your event at a restaurant, they will likely be willing to work with you on a brunch-themed menu. Let them know what you want and they will let you know what they can do.

, Celebrate the season by selecting local, seasonal foods that could easily grow in your own garden. If you are having a spring shower, produce like artichoke, chives, and fennel are great to include. If your shower is in the fall, look for foods like cranberries, pumpkin, and sweet potato.Find recipes that are versatile and can be dressed to fit any season. Pasta salad, for example, can be made a fresh spring dish by including garlic flowers and sweet veggies such as bell peppers and cucumber. Or make a fall salad using dried cranberries and root vegetables.

, Work with a local baker to get a cake or desserts that brings in floral elements. You may opt to have fondant or frosting flowers, or you may ask for actual flowers to be used a part of the decorations. If you are skilled at cake decorating, this may also be something you can do at home.Cupcakes work well for garden showers because they can each be frosted as a different flower, bringing visual variety to the dessert table.
Bring the flavors of the season into desserts by asking the baker if they can incorporate fresh, seasonal fruit into the cake, cake filling or in other desserts such as mousse or cookies.

Check the local weather forecast.,
Keep children indoors in very cold conditions.,
Keep children indoors in very hot temperatures.,
Follow your school’s guidelines.",How to Know the Temperature Is Safe to Play Outside1," The first place to start is with your local weather. Turn on the local forecast or go online and look up the day’s temperature. Be aware of any inclement weather and listen especially for excessive heat or cold warnings.


Take note of the temperature if you have an outdoor thermometer. This will give you some idea of the conditions outside. But keep in mind that it doesn’t give the whole story: thermometers record the air temperature. They do not register wind chill or heat index, which make it feel colder or warmer than the actual air temperature.;
, Extreme cold can lead to hypothermia, when the body’s natural temperature gets too low, or frostbite. The Canadian Pediatric Society recommends that children play inside in temperatures under -25ºC/-13ºFHowever, this is the absolute limit – when the skin begins to freeze in only a few minutes.


The state of Oklahoma recommends that children play inside when wind chills fall below 10ºF.However, kids need to come inside for breaks every 20 to 30 minutes when the wind chill is below 32ºF.In the United States, the National Weather Service will issue a wind chill advisory or warning when wind chills are low enough to pose a threat to human life. If your area is under such a warning, you should definitely keep your kids inside., Very hot conditions can put children at risk of heatstroke, heat exhaustion, burns from hot object like playground equipment, sunburn, and excessive thirst, especially during active play. Have kids stay indoors when temperatures are over 35ºC - 40ºC/95ºF - 100ºF and wait for it to cool down.If your kids are active, or if you live in a warmer climate, it is a good idea to limit play or exercise to cooler periods in the morning or evening. Avoid playing in hot weather between 10am - 4pm.The National Weather Service issues excessive heat warning and advisories whenever it is hot enough to be hazardous to human health. You should keep your kids inside if your area is under such a warning., Many schools have rules on what temperatures are suitable for outdoor play, and hold indoor recess if it becomes either too hot or too cold. Learn what rules your school has and try following them at home; if outdoor recess is cancelled, you’ll know the temperature is dangerous.

"
"
Check the weather for the “apparent temperature.” Knowing when to keep your children inside is made harder by the fact that the air temperature does not always reflect how hot or cold it feels outdoors.,
Know the danger zones for wind chill.,
Know the danger zones for heat index.",How to Know the Temperature Is Safe to Play Outside2," This is because other factors affect heat and cold, especially wind chill and humidity. The number to know, then, is what is called the “apparent temperature.” This is how hot or cold is actually feels to you outdoors after you account for the wind and the humidity.Wind chill is the apparent temperature in cold weather, the perceived decrease in air temperature felt when wind is felt on exposed skin. Meteorologists calculate wind chill by using advanced formulas. However, you can find charts and calculators online that will do the math for you. All you need to know is the air temperature and wind speed. The chart will then give you the wind chill factor for the day.
Heat index is the apparent temperature for hot weather. The heat index is what the temperature feels like to the human body when you account for the humidity in the air. This too is calculated with complex formulas, but you can find charts online that will do the math for you. All you have to know is the air temperature and the relative humidity for the day.

, According to the National Weather Service, frost bite can occur in a matter of minutes once wind chills go below -18ºF.Following their calculation, however, you’ll want to keep your kids indoors well before that.


For example, when the air temperature is 30ºF, a brisk wind of even 10 miles per hour lowers the wind chill factor to about 21ºF, which is about the limit for safe play. An air temp of 25ºF and a light wind of 5 mph make for a wind chill of 19 ºF.

, Like wind chill, be aware of what levels of apparent hot temperatures are safe and what are unsafe. Consider the following: an air temperature of 90ºF will feel like 97ºF when the relative humidity is at 70%. An air temperature of 95ºF will feel like 114ºF with a relative humidity of 80%. These apparent temperatures can be very unsafe.


Keep in mind sunlight, as well. Full exposure to the sun can increase heat index factors by up to 15ºF. A 97ºF heat index will then feel fully like 112ºF

"
"
Dress kids appropriately.,
Watch for signs of excessive cold or heat.,
Keep kids well hydrated.,
Apply sunscreen and avoid direct sun.",How to Know the Temperature Is Safe to Play Outside3," You should plan accordingly when the weather is either very cold or very hot. Dress your kids for their activities – this means a coat or snowsuit, mittens, scarf, hat, and boots for snow play, layered clothing for intermediate temperatures, and light clothing when it's hot.


The key to dressing for cold weather is layering. Active kids will get hot outdoors, even when it’s cold. The problem is that they will sweat, and this dampness can be uncomfortable and actually make them lose body heat more quickly – this is a risk for hypothermia. Dress them in layers so that, for example, they can remove their heavy coat if they overheat.Try three layers: an inner level that keeps dabs moisture and keeps it away from most of the body (polyester and modern materials are good; cotton is not). A middle layer is for insulation. This can consist of wool or fleece and even be in several layers. Finally, an outer layer is for the usual wind, water, and ice clothing – coat with hood, hat, snow pants, etc., A child who is too hot or too cold will show signs to look for. If you recognize any of these signs, take steps to get him inside to either cool down or warm up. If your child's symptoms do not go away within a few minutes, then call your child's doctor. Call 911 or emergency services if symptoms are severe.

Exposure to excessive heat can lead to muscle cramps, for example, and also fainting. These may be signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Dizziness, weakness, nausea, or lack of coordination are indications that something is seriously wrong. Dark colored urine is a sign that the child is dehydrated. Children who are too cold may or may not say anything. Believe a child if she says she is too cold. Shivering, for example, though minor, is the first symptom of hypothermia. More serious signs include dizziness, hunger, nausea, fatigue, rapid breathing, and lack of coordination., One of the best things you can do to avoid heat-related illnesses in children is to make sure that they drink enough fluids. As said above, proper clothing will control over-heating, which will in turn lessen sweating and loss of fluids. Make sure you wear clothing appropriate to the environment. Clothes that are too thick or too warm can quickly cause a person to become overheated.


Children sweat less and have less evaporative cooling than adults. Let them exercise at their preferred level; do not urge them to exercise harder or play a strenuous sport in hot conditions.
Don’t rely on your children telling you that they are thirst as a guide to their hydration. Thirst is actually a poor indicator.Have water and other beverages available to kids in hot and cold weather. In times of high fluid loss or significant sweating, be sure to replace your child's electrolytes as well by giving your child a sports drink or an oral electrolyte solution like Pedialyte.

, Avoiding the sun is not just about keeping kids cool. It is also about keeping their skin safe from harmful UV rays and avoiding sunburn, which can be particularly bad for young children.Have your kids apply sunscreen all year round, even in winter, as one way to protect them from the sun. Use a screen with an SPF of at least 30.
Avoid the strongest rays of the day – these occur at the same times of peak temperatures, between 10 am and 3 pm. Also, utilize shade strategically, either natural shade of trees of with an umbrella.

Choose a recent picture of your son or daughter.,
Write down the information you'd like to put on the card.,
Create a text box on your computer.,
Type your child's information in the box.,
Add your child's picture.,
Insert a border.,
Save your file.,
Print and laminate the ID card.",How to Make an ID Card for Your Children," In case your child ever goes missing, having a good picture of them to provide to the police will be extremely valuable. Pick a picture that is clear and well-lit, so that you can easily see your child's face. Avoid using a full-body shot - instead, choose one where just your child's face and shoulders are visible. If possible, use a picture with a light background, or at least one with a solid-colored background, to ensure that your child's face is the focus of the image. If you don't have a good enough picture, you can always take one yourself with these considerations in mind.;
, It's up to you to decide how much personal information you'd like to include on your child's ID card. While you may not want to put down all of their personal information, some things you may want to include are:


Your child's name
Your child's date of birth
Your child's sex
Your child's hair and eye color
Your child's height and weight
Any allergies, medical conditions, or disabilities your child has
Any emergency contact information

, To do this, open up a program like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. Remember to make the text box a similar size as a credit card (roughly 2x3 inches), so that you can easily keep a copy of the ID in your wallet.

, Input all of the information you'd like to include, and play around with the formatting until you're happy with how it looks. Use a font that's clear and easy to read, such as Arial or Times New Roman. You can use colors, bold, italics, or underlines to draw attention to the most important pieces of information on the card.

, To complete the ID card, insert a copy of the picture you chose earlier, and fit it into your text box. The image should be approximately 1.5x1.5 inches, and is usually placed in the upper right corner of the card.

, To make a border around your child's ID card, adjust the line weight as shown, using whichever line weight you feel looks the best.

, Once you're happy with the way your child's ID card looks, save the file so that whenever you need to update it, you won't have to start the process all over again.

, If possible, print the ID in color so that your child's picture will be as accurate as possible. From there, laminate the ID card to protect it.

Encourage creativity with arts and crafts.,
Let them color or paint.,
Use music.,
Ask them to make up a story or put on a show.",How to Keep Your Kids Occupied1," If you have young children, they will usually be happy making simple crafts like paper chains. Keep them occupied by challenging them to create new masterpieces or asking them to decorate something for you. Only let them do things that you trust them to do alone, or have an older child help them and watch over them if you can't be in the same room at all times.


If there is a holiday coming up (big or small), give your kids some colorful paper and markers and ask them to make holiday-themed cards or decorations.
Find something that could use some embellishment and ask them to decorate it. You can buy plain items like picture frames, t-shirts, birdhouses, or plaques at a crafts store, or you can find something around the house that could use a creative touch.
You can use lots of ordinary household items as arts and crafts supplies. For example, have your kids make snowflakes out of paper plates, let them use old socks to make hand puppets, or task them with creating some creatures out of materials like empty tissue boxes, toilet paper rolls, and paper cups. You can also give them old magazines to make a collage.;
, If your children are young, give them some coloring books or blank paper, provide them with lots of felt tip pens or crayons, and let them draw or color. If you don't mind them getting things messy, painting, either with brushes or with their fingers, is a great way for your kids to express themselves.


Be sure to stick any of their creations on the fridge or a wall afterwards to show them that you are proud of what they have done.
You can also give them some Play-Doh, along with lots of plastic cutters, and let them sculpt something.

, If your children like to dance, put on their favorite music and encourage them to make up their own dance moves.


They could play Musical Statues, where they dance until the music stops. Get an older child to put on some music and operate the stereo/CD player. Musical Chairs is also a good choice.
Try telling them to make up a dance routine that they can perform for you when you have finished cleaning or doing whatever you have to do.

, If your children are old enough, have them write down their stories or plays. If they are not old enough to write, you can write them down or ask an older child to write them down for them.


You can incorporate an arts and crafts aspect into this activity by having children illustrate their stories or create puppets or costumes for a later performance.
If your kids are having a hard time thinking of a story, ask them to make up a sequel or prequel to a story they already know. You can also try providing them with the first few sentences and then ask them to expand upon your story.
You can also have kids work together by each telling a small part of the story, building off of what the others have already said."

Lay a washcloth on a flat surface.,
Roll the bottom of the washcloth up and over.,
Turn the washcloth 90 degrees.,
Roll the washcloth from the bottom, up and over, until you’ve created a tight circular roll.,
Hold the washcloth tightly and push it into a lollipop bag.

,
Secure the bottom of the bag with a small rubber band so that the washcloth lollipop does not come unfurled.

Give them some board games.,
Challenge them with a jigsaw puzzle.,
Let them play outside.,
Try a scavenger hunt.,
Set up an obstacle course.,
Make your own matching games.",How to Keep Your Kids Occupied2," Games that kids won't need much help with (like Candy Land) are best if you are trying to occupy your kids so you can get things done around the house. Try not to use difficult games like Monopoly, unless there is an older child who can help the younger ones.


Card games are good, too. You can find specialty card games for kids, or you can teach your kids to play simple card games like War and Go Fish with a standard deck of cards.
If you don’t have any games on hand, teach them to play a game that doesn’t require any materials, such as I Spy, Simon Says, or Red Light, Green Light.

, You can find puzzles for all different ages and difficulty levels. You can also have children create their own puzzles with cardboard or construction paper, and if you have multiple children, you can ask them to complete each other’s puzzles.

, This could be playing football, skipping, playing on a trampoline, or playing games with each other such as chase or hide and seek.


If you have smaller children, fill a large bucket or something quite big with water and add plastic boats, rubber ducks and other toys. You can also use this same bucket to put sand in and let them build miniature sand castles.
Give them some sports equipment and tell them to make up a new sport. You can get creative with the materials by using buckets for targets or trash can lids for bases, for example.

, You can either hide items around the house, or just create a list of items they will be likely to encounter in the area where you’re playing., You can use furniture or any other household items as obstacles, and set up your course either indoors or outdoors.Make up new rules for each round or rearrange obstacles to keep things interesting.

, For younger children, encourage critical thinking by making up your own games with materials you already have around the house. You can write numbers or letters on scraps of paper and ask them to put them in the proper order, or give them pictures cut out from magazines and ask them to group them in a specific way.The possibilities are endless.

Take a trip to a local museum or art gallery.,
Teach your children about animals by taking them to a local farm.,
Get active with indoor activities.,
Enjoy the great outdoors.,
Go to the movies.",How to Keep Your Kids Occupied3," There are many museums that are specifically designed for children, and others that have special activities for children.The Association of Children's Museums can help you find a children's museum near you.


In addition to museums specifically designed for children, many have exhibits that children might find interesting. Consider natural history museums, especially those with dinosaur or Egyptian mummy exhibits, planetariums, wax museums, or aviation museums.

, No matter where you live, there’s likely to be a farm or petting zoo not far from you that will give your kids a great opportunity to interact with and learn about animals.Zoos and aquariums are also great ways for kids to learn about new animals while having fun.

, Bowling, ice skating, roller skating,swimming, gymnastics, and rock climbing are all good options. Kids will burn off energy, while also having fun and learning a new skill. You can also look for indoor trampoline parks, indoor water parks, and family fun centers in your area.

, Depending on where you live, you could visit the beach, the lake, or the mountains. Even if you don’t live near any exciting outdoor attractions, you can try visiting a local park or taking a walk or a bike ride around town.

, If you don’t have time for that or you’d like to save some money, take your children to rent a DVD/video. Make sure it is something that they will all enjoy and that they have all decided on. When you have to do a job or you are busy, get them together and put on the film.

Consider your child’s typical “go to” banter.,
Don’t plant ideas in his/her head before meeting your boss.,
Set a good example when socializing in public.,
Know how to react if your child says something embarrassing.",How to Make Sure Your Child Doesn't Say Embarrassing Things to Your Boss," If you can prepare for a visit, think about whether your child usually becomes extremely quiet around strangers or adults or does he/she turn into a complete blabbermouth?


Let your child know that he/she will be coming to work with you and meeting your boss. Don't plant ideas or even describe your boss, just look for a reaction--your child may not have any reaction or may not even remember your boss. If he/she has no reaction, now is the time to use positive adjectives (even if they are not true or your don’t believe them) about your boss. Words like “nice,” “friendly” and even “helpful” are good words that a child will understand.
Discuss what is considered to be appropriate behavior at work. If your child attends school liken work to school, reminding him/her of manners and how teachers and other adults should be treated with respect. Review some general rules such as no running or screaming in the office, not to interrupt adults when they are talking (unless you are bleeding or it’s an emergency) and to say “please” and “thank you.”
Use this moment to open the floor to questions from your child. Be truthful but always lean toward the positive. Don’t use adjectives that could be have a double meaning such as saying that your boss has a “strong” presence in the office, which could be misconstrued as being overbearing. If you are odds with your boss, stick to the rules you hand down to your child, “If you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything at all.” Keep comments brief, positive and nondescript.;
, If you tell your child not to talk about the bathroom or mom’s superhero action figure collection that will most likely be the first thing he/she goes to when meeting your boss.


Avoid listing hot topics to avoid. For example if your boss is portly, don’t tell your child, “Now Mr. Anderson is pretty fat so be sure you don’t say anything about weight.” What will be the first thing your child remembers during the meeting--fat.
Recall how you’ve described your boss in the past to either your spouse and/or your family. Did you say that your boss had a hot temper or was insane? Remember if you’ve used derogatory comments around your child in the past you’ll have to think of a way to change his/her perception before arrival at work. After you ask your child if he/she remembers your boss reinforce the positive visual or image you are trying to create by using upbeat descriptive words.
Provide a list of topics that your child may ask or discuss when around your boss. Along with the reminder of the best way to speak with adults, let your child know a few topics he/she could cover such as the sports, the weather or your new puppy, for example.

, Long before your child makes a trip to your office, remember that you are your child’s main role model. How you approach and interact with others is not only being observed but also studied by your child.


Have something positive to say to and about everyone you meet. Even if you aren’t a fan of one of the moms in your child’s class never tell your child that you think the other mother is a gold digger, for example (or any other derogatory comment). Instead you can just general, blanket statements such as saying that she is nice and be pleasant when you must interact with this individual.
Use your manners. Sometimes even adults forget their manners, which is why it’s especially important that you say “thank you” when necessary, make eye contact with people and smile.
Show your children proper table manners. In the event you could possible dine with your boss or any other adults, it’s important that your child knows proper table etiquette. He/she doesn’t need to know which fork goes with which dish, but should understand the basics such as napkin in the lap, elbows off the table and don’t talk with a full mouth of food.

, “Out of the mouths of babes” is an accurate description of how kids can say truthful but embarrassing things. Instead of turning beat red and then yelling at your child, have a response ready that will allow you to retain some shred of dignity and possibly your job.


Learn to address your child’s actions with humor. Check your boss’s reaction and then roll your eyes and laugh off what your child said. Be sure your boss sees that you are not thrilled with your child, but don’t have a tantrum or yell at your child, especially in front of the boss.
Be sure you address what your child has said in a controlled, gentle voice. Correct your child by saying, “That isn’t an accurate observation Jimmy” and then apologize to your boss.
Make direct eye contact with your child so that he/she knows that what he said wasn’t spot on. Don’t make wild eyes to the point where you are glaring at your child but your child should know “the look” that means he/she needs to stop talking--immediately.

Identify your fertile days.",How to Plan for Kids," The first step is to decide, independently and for yourself, whether you want to have a child. Are you willing to take responsibility for another human being? Are you prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to raise a child? Do you genuinely want to be a parent?


Consider, too, whether you want to have more than one child. Of course, people change their minds, but having an idea about how many children you’d like will help you plan for your family effectively.;
, If you have a spouse or partner, you should talk to this person at length about your plans; after all, having a family is something you will need to do together. Both of you should feel ready to start a family; otherwise, it might not be the right time.


Discuss your plans for raising children. What kind of parents will you be? What methods of education and discipline will you use? What kind of person do you want your child to become?
Talk about potentially divisive topics, such as religion. If you and your partner have different religious backgrounds, you should try to decide in advance how you will deal with that issue. In what religion will you raise your child? What will you teach your child about religion?

, Pregnancy and parenthood will certainly affect your career. Depending on your current job, you may need to consider whether you will be able to balance your career obligations with your family life. If you plan to return to work after your child is born, consider:


how your pregnancy and postpartum recovery period will affect your career
whether your typical working hours will allow you to be an active, involved parent
who will take care of your child while you are working
whether you will be able to afford the cost of child care

, When you have a child, your social life will change. It will be more difficult to go out at night, and you may find that you are too tired or too wrapped up in domestic concerns to try. You may see your friends less frequently, especially those who do not have children themselves. Traveling will become more complicated.

, Becoming parents may strengthen your bond and cement your relationship, but it will also change your time together. Your time and affections will have to be shared by your partner and your child or children, and your kids will often have to take precedence: their needs will come first. You will have to work harder to make time for romance and sex.

, Think about things you would like to do before you start your family, and try to do as many of those things as you can. For example, consider:


traveling, especially to exotic or romantic destinations
enjoying parties and nightlife
indulging in luxuries like massages, salon treatments, and shopping
accomplishing health and fitness goals
achieving important career milestones

, Before you conceive, do some reading and research about pregnancy, prenatal care, baby care, and parenting. Know what you’re getting into! You’ll be better prepared to handle these challenges in you think about them in advance.

, Depending on your living situation, you may need to move to a better location or a larger space. Think about:


whether you have enough space. Will children have their own bedrooms? How do you feel about them sharing bedrooms? Do you have storage space for their belongings?
whether your home is conveniently located. Are you close to good schools and recreational opportunities? Are there parks and safe places to play?
whether you have family and friends nearby. When you have a baby, it can help to be near loved ones. Consider whether you want to be closer to friends and family members.

, It may be impossible to choose exactly how far apart your children are spaced, but it can help to think about whether you’d like your children to be close in age or not.


When children are close in age, they will have more in common and may enjoy many of the same activities. They will grow up together. However, having more than one young child at a time can mean a lot of work for you, especially during the first couple of years.
When children are further apart in age, they may have less in common and seem less close as siblings. However, it may be less stressful to have only one young child at a time, and if you wait to have a second child, your first may be able to help and serve as a role model.

, If possible, before you start trying to conceive, consider working extra hours or doing side work to raise extra money. Having a family is expensive – often more expensive than people realize. Increasing your income now will help offset future costs.

, Children are expensive. You will need to buy equipment (crib, stroller, car seat, high chair, and the like), clothes, diapers, and feeding supplies. Ideally, you should research the costs of these things in your area before you start trying to conceive.

, If you plan to return to work, you will need to find quality child care. Depending on your area, you may also need to pay for your child’s education once he or she reaches school age. These are major expenses that must be considered before you start a family.


If you do plan to use a child care provider, make sure you find one that is fully licensed. Doing so will help ensure that you can deduct some of the expense from your taxable income.

, Even if you plan to return to work after the birth of your baby, chances are that during and after your pregnancy, you’ll miss work for various reasons. Additionally, depending on your job, you may not be paid for any maternity leave you take.

, When you are planning to have kids, you should start saving as much money as you can. Doing so will help offset future costs. It will also make you feel more comfortable and secure in your decision to start a family.

, If your job allows it, working from home may help you solve some of the most common problems with work-life balance while keeping all or part of your income.


Note, however, that even if you work from home, you will probably need to pay for some child care. Otherwise, you will struggle to accomplish anything when home with your child.

, Depending on your job and your area, you may benefit from disability insurance, which could, in some situations, make sure that you continue to earn an income during your pregnancy. Do some research, and factor that into your plans.

, You may be able to purchase some items used, and you may be able to get some items free from friends and family members with older children. Look into these options before you start purchasing everything brand new.


Consider checking Craigslist, garage sales, and second-hand stores as well. Children outgrow this equipment so quickly that it's best to be frugal.
Car seats should always be purchased new. It’s the only way to be sure that the seat has not been in an accident (which makes it unsafe for us). With other items, just use caution and make sure they conform to safety standards. You may have to do some research to be positive.

, Before you conceive, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to get standard blood tests, update your vaccinations, and discuss your overall health. Particular concerns may include:


your weight. Being at a healthy weight will make it easier to conceive and will help maximize your odds of having a healthy pregnancy.
your age. If you are over 35, you should talk to your doctor about how your age will affect a potential pregnancy.
chronic illnesses. If you have heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other major health issue, you should discuss a potential pregnancy with your doctor. When you get pregnant, you may need to adjust your medications or take additional steps to ensure that you and your baby stay healthy.

, The hormone fluctuations associated with pregnancy can cause or exacerbate problems with your teeth and gums. It’s best to see a dentist before you conceive to resolve any longstanding issues and make sure you start your pregnancy with good oral health and hygiene.

, In addition to seeing your doctor and dentist, you should make an appointment with your gynecologist before you start trying to conceive. Your gynecologist will perform a routine pelvic exam and Pap test to check for infections, signs of cervical cancer, and any other problems that might make conceiving or carrying a baby to term difficult.


Seeing your gynecologist is especially important if you have a history of miscarriages, stillborn births, or ectopic pregnancies.
If you start trying to conceive and do not see results within six months to a year, you’ll want to schedule another appointment to discuss potential fertility problems.

, Good nutrition is vital to a healthy pregnancy, even during the earliest period, when you may not even realize that you are pregnant. Therefore, it’s best to start eating healthfully before you conceive. Aim to consume plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products.


Make sure, especially, to get enough vitamin D, iron, calcium, and folic acid. Consider taking a daily prenatal vitamin as soon as you start trying to conceive.

, Regular, moderate exercise will improve your mood, energy levels, and blood circulation. It will also help you maintain a healthy weight.

, Smoking during pregnancy is very dangerous. The nicotine and carbon monoxide in cigarettes can cause stillborn births, premature deliveries, and low birth weights. Furthermore, smoking during pregnancy can cause problems for your child later in life: he or she may have lung, heart, or brain problems as a result. If you smoke, do everything you can to stop before you start trying to conceive.

, Like smoking, drinking alcohol is very dangerous during pregnancy. It increases the likelihood of miscarriages and stillborn births, and it also raises the risk of your child developing learning, speech, language, or behavior problems. In severe cases, heavy drinking leads to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which permanently damages the child’s central nervous system. Stop drinking as soon as you start trying to conceive.

, Just as smoking and drinking can threaten your pregnancy and pose risks to your unborn children, using other drugs can also be extremely dangerous. The particular consequences depend on the specific drugs, but in general, it’s best to stop putting any unnecessary chemicals into your body once you start trying to conceive.

, Before you start trying to conceive, you need to consider whether your job will affect your ability to conceive or to have a healthy pregnancy. If you have a physically demanding job or work someplace where you could be exposed to harmful chemicals or fumes, you may need to modify or quit your job.

, Once you have seen your doctor, dentist, and gynecologist and taken steps to ensure you are as healthy as possible, you can stop using contraception and begin trying to get pregnant.

, You can increase your odds of conceiving by charting your menstrual cycle and having sex during your fertile period. For most women, days 11 to 14 are the most fertile; for best results, you might try having sex every day or every other day between days 7 and 20.


If your menstrual cycle is irregular or you are having trouble conceiving, consider using an ovulation predictor kit. You can buy these kits online or at drug stores. They check your urine for luteinizing hormone (LH) to help you determine your most fertile days.

Have games where both adults and children can participate.,
Include a family-friendly dance party at your event.,
Identify guests that can help entertain the kids when they get bored.",How to Keep Kids Entertained at Family Gatherings," Think about the kids who are likely to attend the event, whether they’re your kids or your relatives’ kids. Be aware that each age group will have different interests and attention spans.For infants and toddlers, toys need to be simple like stuffed animals, dolls, building blocks, and picture books.
For preschoolers and kindergarteners, toys can be more complex such as simple puzzles, things for pretending and building, and simple toss and throwing games like ball toss.
For elementary school kids, try toys like board games, building blocks, puzzles, sports games, and electronics such as video or computer games.;
, Kids love to do interactive activities like crafts. At family gatherings, have a kid’s area with arts and crafts supplies. Be mindful of how old the children are who are likely to attend. Have supplies that fit the age group, and make sure there are enough supplies for all the children.Have coloring books, colored paper, crayons, and markers on hand.
Have clay and dough to make shapes and creatures.
Have jewelry making and bead kits.

, Depending on the family gathering, there may be certain themes like Christmas or Easter that help to guide your choice of games and activities. The same can be done for family reunions or birthday parties. Even if the event seems more for adults, give kids some activities to keep them interested.If it’s Christmas and it’s been snowing, get the kids outside for a snowman building contest. Or keep the fun indoors with a snowball toss game using Styrofoam cups decorated like snowmen and white pom-poms for tossing.
If it’s a family reunion, have the kids gather around for a “story time” in which some of the adults tell fun and silly stories about growing up as kids. Include pictures and possibly re-enactments to make the storytelling more entertaining.

, Kids love adventure and mystery. If you’re hosting the event, before the guests arrive create clues and a list of objects that they need to find around the house. This will work best with kids who are able to read and follow directions.The scavenger hunt could also be a family game in which both kids and adults participate. You could have teams that work together on the mystery clues.
Have some prizes ready for the kids when the scavenger hunt is over that can keep them entertained throughout the event.

, Create a room or area where kids can be kids and feel like they can have fun together. Consider a space that's separate from the adults where they can get a little loud without interfering. They can feel like they're having their own party in this space.


If it's an indoor space, choose rooms like a family room or basement play room that's away from the main gathering area.
If it's an outdoor space, choose an area that's not too close or too far from the main outdoor patio area, such as a playground space, tree house, or open lawn area.

, Have a place where kids can be entertained in their own way, with games, movies, and music that are kid-oriented. This can help to keep kids engaged and focused if the main family activities aren't as interesting.Have a few movies ready that kids enjoy watching, such as some animated classics.
Have some video games available if you already have a game center. Pick out a few that are kid-friendly.
Get karaoke set up for them to sing and be silly.

, At family gatherings, you may be so focused on getting some elegant dishes out for your relatives that you forget that kids can be picky eaters. Consider making a special food table with kid-friendly snacks for them to enjoy.


Place the snacks in the ""kid zone"" so that they can feel special with their own table of goodies.
Be mindful of your relatives' expectations for their kids' diets. Have healthy snacks as well as salty or sweet treats on hand.
With a snack table available, they'll be able to stave off hunger if the event is long.

, Kids love to get their hands messy with baking and sweet treats. If you’re planning to have them over for a holiday feast, give them a side project to work on making cookies or decorating some goodies.Have some pre-made sugar cookies ready for them to decorate with icing and sprinkles.
Have a variety of chocolate, peppermint, and candy goodies on hand. Have them make little marshmallow snowmen or possibly some cookie ornaments. Even if the treats that they make aren’t eaten, they can be fun to show off to guests., Make them feel like an important part of the event. Have them partner up with one of the other kids or a trusted adult. Give them a small task to do throughout the event that makes them feel like they’ve helped out.


Let’s say that they’re bigger kids at a holiday party. You could ask them to monitor the crafts table and help other kids engage in the fun. Maybe the kids know how to draw or make origami. Ask them to act as a teacher for the other kids.
Maybe there’s a shy kid who feels left out. Have them buddy up with a friendly and trusted adult at the event. Have the adult and kid pass out food to the guests or help out setting up the table.

, Kids enjoy little prizes as something to look forward to. Have some goodie bags on hand for the kids when they’ve been helpful during the event. If you do have them help out by baking, serving guests, or other activities, give them an incentive to help through small prizes.


Consider small prizes from dollar stores that they may find interesting or fun.
Have the prizes be something they can enjoy at the event itself. If it’s a holiday party, consider prizes with themes related to the holiday.

, Get the whole family involved in games with the kids. Instead of having the kids sidelined while the adults talk amongst each other, have games and activities that allow interaction between adults and kids.


Set aside time during the event to play board games or charades.
Have some adults and kids interact with outdoor games like soccer, badminton, or cornhole toss if it’s good weather outside. Set up some games in advance so that kids and adults are more likely to pick up and start the games themselves., Kids and adults alike love to dance. Have an area where people can dance. Set up speakers that don’t overpower the event, but help to get people in the mood to boogie. Play music that can appeal to young and old alike, and that doesn’t offend people.


If it’s a holiday party, try a combination of festive music with dance music.
Get a small group of kids and adults to start dancing at first. More than likely, more people will join in after the dancing starts.

, Some kids will get bored more easily without structured activities. Recruit a few trusted adults that enjoy playing with kids. Ask them to help out at the event by overseeing some structured activities.Talk with a few guests possibly before and at the beginning of the event to recruit them as “volunteers.” Most people will be happy to help if they are already interested in spending time with the kids.
Get artistic and creative guests involved. For example, if you have a relative that plays guitar and knows some songs, have them play for the kids and other guests, after asking for their help.

Talk to your child's teachers.",How to Improve Social Skills in Children," One of the basics of social skills involves personal space. Young children may fail to understand everyone has a personal space bubble that should be respected.Explain to kids that personal space varies from person to person, and from culture to culture. People they are closer to, like relatives and siblings, may be more open to hugging and touching than strangers. Likewise, people from other cultures may prefer more or less personal space.Tell kids how to read body language. Teach them that people tensing up, crossing their arms, and backing away is a sign their personal space is being invaded.
You should also let kids know they're entitled to their own personal space. Do not pick them up without their permission, or hug them if they do not want to be hugged. Let them know they have authority over their own bodies.
Teach children to do the same in return. Have them ask permission before hugging people, sitting in people's laps, and so on.;
, Empathy is another important basic of social skills. A young child's perspective is limited. Children may struggle to understand how to put themselves in another person's shoes. Try to make an effort to help kids understand empathy.Encourage kids to use their imagination. Have them picture themselves in a variety of different scenarios. Look for learning opportunities throughout the day. For example, if your child tells you he or she saw someone getting picked on in school, encourage your child to imagine how they would feel in a similar scenario.
When watching TV or movies, ask your kids how they think a character is feeling and why. Encourage them to imagine themselves in a similar scenario and think about how they would feel.

, Basic conversation skills are vital to social development. Young children are often unsure of how to converse, and may be prone to interrupting conversations or ignoring what's being said. Talk to your kids about basic conversation skills.Talk to kids about how to enter a conversation. Explain basic greetings. Instruct children to greet others by saying things like, ""Hi!"" and ""How are you?"" Explain non-verbal cues as well, like waving, smiling, nodding, and hand shaking.
Explain to children they should take their turns speaking in conversation. Tell them it's important to wait until someone else finishes talking before interjecting. Also, teach kids about listening. Explain that, in a conversation, you should respond to what the other person is saying rather than simply talking about yourself.
Teach your children how to be assertive when they talk to people as well. Explain to your child that being assertive is not the same as being aggressive. It means asking for what you want in a direct, honest way. People who communicate in an assertive way do not use threats, insults, or excuses to get what they want., Children often do not know basic manners, so these are important to teach as well. Explain to kids it's very important to say please, thank you, excuse me, and other forms of common courtesy. Make a rule in your home about remembering pleases and thank-yous. This will show children how to convey positive manners.

, Children may often accidentally say insulting things when trying to express wants and needs. For example, your daughter may tell her older brother he's mean if he doesn't give her a turn during a game. What she's trying to communicate is that dislikes feeling left out. Teach children how to appropriately tell others what they want and need.Catch children in the moment. You may hear your son tell your daughter that she's hogging a toy. Interject with something like, ""Mason, what you really mean is that you want Charlotte to give you a turn. Tell her you want to feel included as well.""
Teach children to be upfront with other people about behaviors that make them uncomfortable. A preschool age child may kick and hit when he feels he's being made fun of. Instead, teach him to use his words. Tell him, when he's met with mockery, to say something like, ""It hurts my feeling when you talk like that and I need you to stop.""
Have children stop and think when they're upset. If a child is not sure what he or she wants or needs, ask questions to help that child figure this out. Ask something like, ""Why does that make you angry? Why do you react that way?""

, Reading fiction has been shown to help foster feelings of empathy in both children and adults. Go for high-quality literary children's stories over popular fiction, as characters are often less developed in works designed for a mass audience. Classic children's stories, like The Little Prince and Charlotte's Web, may help children develop empathy. This can help kids learn better social skills throughout life., A great way to help your kid understand social skills is to simply model good behavior yourself. Be respectful of others during your day-to-day life. If your take your kids grocery shopping, make polite conversation with the cashier. When you pick your child up after school, be kind and courteous to other parents, teachers, and school officials. Children look up to their parents and will pick up on good habits from observing you., Emotional charades is a great game designed to teach children to read non-verbal social cues. To play the game, you can write down a variety of emotions on pieces of paper, like happy, sad, scared, etc. Then, place the slips of paper in some kind of container. Take turns drawing slips and acting out the emotions. This can help teach kids to recognize what someone looks like when they're experiencing a certain emotion.You can also play a variation that's like pictionary. Have your kids draw pictures of people or animals conveying a certain emotion and try to guess that emotion.

, Eye contact is also an important social skill. In western culture, the ability to maintain eye contact shows someone that you're listening and paying attention. Play games that teach kids how to maintain eye contact.Staring contests can be a fun, playful way to teach your kids about eye contact.
You can play a game called ""Eyes on the forehead."" Place a stick of a pair of eyes on your forehead and instruct your kids to keep an eye on the sticker. This won't be eye contact, exactly, but it will give kids a sense of the direction they should look when talking to someone.
When playing on a swing, encourage your child to make eye contact with you.
Make sure that you teach your child that not all cultures value eye contact and some cultures even consider making eye contact to be rude., Friendships are important to a child's social development. In order to help your child develop social skills, support his or her friendships. Help them blossom and develop.Host playdates. Talk to parents of your children's friends and offer to have the kids over for a day.
Take your kids to events where he or she will see friends. School events, birthday parties, and trips to places like the park can be a great way to assure your child sees his or her friends regularly.
Help your child deal with rifts with friendships. Explain that it's normal for friends to fight or get angry with one another. Encourage your child to apologize if he or she hurts a friend's feelings.

, Research shows important social skills, like leadership and empathy, can be learned through team sports. If your kids are interested in sports, consider enrolling them in a little league team of some kind.In addition to having a positive effect on overall social skills, playing sports encourages physical activity and healthy habits. Kids who engaged in team sports during their youth are less likely to smoke and also may have better self esteem.
Keep in mind, however, that not all kids enjoy sports. If your child is very resistant to sports, don't force it. There are many other extracurricular activities that promote teamwork and togetherness. These can be just as beneficial as team sports to your child.

, Extracurriculars can be a great way to encourage kids to develop social skills. Encourage your kids to join clubs at school or get involved in local organizations.


Cater to your child's interest. If your kids are interested in writing and art, have them take classes at a local art center or sign up for the school paper.
Think about clubs like Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts. Many children learn vital skills through such organizations.

, If your child does not seem to be developing socially, this could be indicative of an underlying mental health disorder. If you have concerns about your child's social development, talk a child psychiatrist or therapist. You can ask your child's regular doctor for a referral or find a therapist through your insurance provider.

, If your child is not developing socially, this can be a sign that something is different. A variety of conditions, like genetic disabilities or autism, can cause your child to develop at a slower or uneven pace. Seek help from a pediatrician or child psychiatrist if your child seems to have difficulties in the following areas:Between 19 to 24 months, your child may not interact with others. Your child may not smile when looking at you or give reaction. A child may also not engage in play or recognize pictures of familiar objects. These symptoms can indicate that your child may be autistic.
With autism, as a child gets older, social development may continue to move slowly or at an uneven pace. A child may not engage in brief conversations, follow simple directions, listen to stories, make friends, initiate conversations, or express physical states. This means, your child may not say things like ""I'm hungry"" or ""I'm hurt.""

, You should make a point of talking to your child's teachers regularly. Make sure you ask the teacher about your child's social development. You also want to make sure your child is not getting bullied or harassed in school. Bullying can set a child back slightly in social development. Having a healthy relationship with your child's teacher can help you keep your eye out for issues like bullying.

Encourage role-playing.,
Twist a new ending to an old story.,
Play charades.,
Put it all together in a show.,
Inspire your child’s future career with toys which match their interests.",How to Keep a Six Year Old Busy1," Children often like to take on different characters. This could include fairy tale characters, superheroes and different professions, like doctors and firemen. Encourage your child to play dress up and pretend to expand their imagination and explore different ideas., Help your child be creative by asking them to tell a story that they know and love, but ask them to make up a whole new ending. You can repeat this game over and over, changing it up every time., This game will get your six-year-old moving and keep them occupied. The more clues they have, the longer the game will last, so take a little time to write down words or phrases for them to act out.Make sure the phrases you use are not too difficult for your child to understand or act out.
The player draws a phrase at random and reads it to himself.
Before starting to act out the phrase, they can indicate how many words it involves by showing that number of fingers to the people who will be guessing the phrase, then the player can hold up one finger to act out the first word, or two fingers to act out the second word, and so on.
The group can also agree on gestures which would indicate if the phrase is the title of a book, movie, song, etc…
The player must act out the phrase physically, without using any words, until the guessers figure out the phrase.

, Once kids have started making up stories, exploring different characters, and acting out phrases, they can put all of these skills together by creating a play. They can use puppets or costumes, or create sets. Give them some ideas and let them get to work on their own or with friends. Six-year-olds will likely spend a lot of time creating a show and you will only need to spend a few minutes to watch it.

, Your six-year-old may be beginning to lean toward certain interests. Allow them to explore these interest with toys which can teach them more and give them a chance to imagine their future. The more interest they have in a toy, the longer it will last. This goes for the day and the years they keep coming back to it.Allow your future architect to build with toys. Try building blocks, LEGOs, Lincoln Logs, and other construction toys. You can also try a tool kit and work bench.
Try science kits with your little scientist. You will likely need to help and supervise with experiments, but your child can play with things like microscopes on her own.
Provide art and craft materials for a tiny artist. Six-year-olds can move beyond clay and dough to paints and pastels. Buy an art or craft kit and allow your child to be creative.
Get cars, model planes, or electric trains for a child who is mechanically inclined.

Ask your child why she moves to your bed during the night.,
Talk about your expectations for your child.,
Read books that discuss children staying in their own beds.,
Try to dissuade your child from wanting to sleep in your bed.,
Speak positively about your child staying in her own bed.",How to Keep Your Toddler Out of Your Bed1," Her answer might make overcoming this challenge much easier. Keeping communication open between you and your child may also help her to feel safer, which is important when your are trying to overcome a challenge like this together.


For example, if your child thinks there is a monster under her bed, and she feels safer in your bed, then “kill” or send the monster on his way in order to make your child feel more comfortable. (The process of doing this will be described later in the article).;
, Explain to your child that you expect her to sleep in her own bed, all night long. Remind her that nighttime is for sleeping, not for walking around the house from bed to bed. Also remind her that your bed is only big enough for sleeping adults, and that your bed does not have enough space for her at night.


Tell your child that even though you both may be sleeping in different beds, you are only a little ways away, and that you are always there for her.
Tell your child that you expect her to stay in bed all night because you want her to have lots of energy for all the fun activities you are going to do with her tomorrow.

, Praise characters that sleep all night long in their own beds. You can purchase specific picture books that deal with the issue of a child staying in her own bed all night long.

, Say things that might deter your child from wanting to sleep in your bed, like the fact that Daddy snores, or that Mommy rolls around a lot and might squish anyone who gets in her way.

Challenge your six-year-old with board games and card games.",How to Keep a Six Year Old Busy2," Your child will be learning important principles to math while staying busy. One person thinks of a number and the other person asks yes or no questions to get clues until they can guess the number. Have your child think of the number first, so you can give them examples of the kinds of questions to ask. The person who has chosen a number should say, “I’m thinking of a number between 1 and 100,” for example. The other person can ask questions like:Is it an odd number?
Is it less than 50?
Can I get to it if I count by fives?

, Give your child containers or non-perishable groceries and have them set up a store. This should take some time as they arrange their products and put prices on everything.

Challenge them with understanding how much each item is if it is being sold as 2 for $8.

, Try experimenting with different items and guessing whether they will float or sink. Have your child compare a block of wood with a plastic bottle cap. Ask which one is heavier and which they think will float. Place the items in the water one at a time to test the predictions.


Push both items under the water and see which one floats back to the top.
Try wadding aluminum foil into a ball and putting it in the water. Then give your child another piece of aluminum foil and ask him to make it into a boat and see if he can make it float.
Explain the dispersion of weight and how the boat is being held up because the weight is spread out over more water to support it., Teach your child “Peter Piper” and see how fast they can repeat it. Have them come up with their own tongue twisters.

Pick out a date to begin your child on an independent sleep pattern.,
Walk your child back to her bed.,
Put up a baby gate if your child keeps getting out of bed.,
Offer a reward for a good night's sleep.,
Let your child help in arranging her room.,
”Kill” any monsters that your child might think are lurking in her room.,
Create a pleasant atmosphere.,
Praise your child when she stays in her own bed for the night.",How to Keep Your Toddler Out of Your Bed2," If you have not already begun to seriously try to keep your child out of your bed, pick a start date. This is the date where you will not turn back when you hear your child crying, but will instead call out that you are right here, and then get into your own bed.


Make sure nothing incredibly major, like moving to a new house, or welcoming a new baby, is happening right around the same time that you begin making your child sleep in her own bed.

, When your child wanders into your room in the night, calmly—and unemotionally—walk her back to her own bed. Do not get angry or show that her getting out of bed has affected you; this will only make her want to get out of bed more often.


Tuck in bed and tell her that you will be close by.

, Prevent your toddler from leaving her room by putting a baby gate across her door, so that you can still see into the room (and get in quickly if need be) but that will not allow your child to get out.


Consider putting a bell on the baby gate so that when your child does try to get out, you will know. Set consequences around the ringing of the bell. For example, you could say, “If I hear that bell ring twice tonight, you will not be able to go to the park with your friend tomorrow”.

, For example, every time she sleeps a full night in her bed, she will get a sticker. You could even have your child pick out a calendar. Every time your child sleeps through the night, she can get a sticker in the morning and put it on the day before to show that she slept through the night.


You could even suggest that when she fills up a whole month, she can get an even bigger prize, like a scoop of ice cream, or a trip to the zoo.

, If you let your child have some say in her room, she may be more inclined to stay in it at night. Ask her how she would like her room arranged, and help her pick out her bedding.


Encourage your child to spend time playing in her room by herself so that she gets used to being in there without you.

, While it may feel silly, check all of the spots where your child thinks there are monsters hiding. You could even say that you have sent the monster away, or killed it.


If your child still isn’t satisfied, consider making a simple book (one made out of paper stapled together) that tells the story of how the monster was actually friendly, or of how the brave little girl’s parents sent the monster away. Draw pictures that your child can color so that she becomes familiar with the story.

, Allow your child to have a nightlight on in the room if need be. Play quiet, soothing music, and give your child a stuffed animal that acts as her ‘guardian’.


If your child has a favorite blanket, make sure she always has it with her before going to bed.

, When your child does manage to sleep in bed all night, shower your child with praise to let her know how happy you are that she stayed in her own bed.


You could even consider getting her a treat.

Put your child’s mattress on the floor.,
Sleep on the floor in your child’s room for a couple of night.,
Do not let your child sleep in your bed under any circumstances.,
Return your child to her bed if she sneaks in.,
Give your child plenty of attention during the day.",How to Keep Your Toddler Out of Your Bed3," If your child is really having a hard time staying in her own room, it might mean that she is not ready to sleep alone yet. However, that does not mean that she should sleep in your bed. Put her mattress on the floor in your room, and tell her that that is her special part of the room, but that your bed is your special part of the room too.


As your child gets more comfortable, move the bed further and further away from your bed.

, Each night, move your bed further and further away from your child’s bed. After two or three days, sit in a chair in your child’s room until your child falls asleep. Do not talk to your child while sitting there; simply sit quietly.If your child begins to talk to you, tell her that you will leave the room if she keeps talking. If she does, leave the room and tell her that you will only come back if she sits quietly in her bed until she falls asleep.

, Whatever the reason—fear, nightmare, fever—do not let your child sleep in your bed. If you do, it will send her mixed messages that could have her coming back to your bed every night.Comfort your child, and even offer to stay near her while she falls back to sleep, but do not let her sleep in your bed.

, Remind her that nighttime is a time for sleeping, not for walking around. Give her a kiss and a hug, and remind her you are nearby, but that you expect her to stay in bed for the rest of the night.

, One reason that children get out of bed is because they want attention from their parents. If you give your child lots of love and attention during the day, she will be less likely to seek it out at night.

Brainstorm with your kids.,
Take coloring to new levels.,
Bake and decorate cookies.,
Make homemade decorations.",How to Keep Kids Busy During Their Holiday Break1," Prior to the holiday break, sit down with your kids and plan out some activities for their vacation time, allowing them to give their input and feel in control of their time off. Brainstorming and planning things to do will also give your kids specific things to look forward to, which will result in happier, more relaxed children. Ask, ""What would you like to do during your break?"" and have kids come up with 2-3 ideas for discussion.To make planning activities fun, make big, colorful notes on a calendar for the time they will be off school so they can keep track of it clearly.;
, Coloring is an activity that kids can get bored with quickly, so make the experience more interesting. Purchase a bulk roll of brown kraft paper or use the inside of wrapping paper to create a large surface for kids to color on freely. You can also try taping coloring sheets to the underside of a table to allow them to try upside-down coloring, or purchase washable markers specifically-made for coloring on windows and let your kids get creative.Look in art supply stores, toy stores, or online for fun, non-toxic coloring tools for your kids.

, The promise of cookies alone will be enough to get your kids interested in baking, but the process can be made even more fun by making things festive. Get kids of any age involved in various steps of baking (like measuring, mixing, sifting, kneading and rolling out dough); use food coloring and cookie cutters to make fun cookie designs. Once the cookies are out of the oven and cooled, allow your kids to decorate them with icing, sprinkles, chocolate syrup, mini marshmallows, or any other fun ingredients you might have on hand.To simplify the activity, buy pre-made dough from the grocery store.

, To harness your kids' holiday spirit and creativity, make homemade decorations with them. Instead of buying craft supplies, use household items like paper, old CDs, and kitchen ingredients for inventive projects. Some fun decorations to try making are:


Painted dough Christmas ornaments
3D paper snowflakes
CD ornaments
Cinnamon ornaments

Throw a family dance party.,
Play a game of “freeze dance.” You can also turn dancing into a game.,
Learn new dance moves together.,
Start a game of musical chairs.",How to Keep Kids Active Indoors1," Perhaps the easiest way to get active as a family is simply to pop on some fun music and start dancing! You can make a family dance party a fun part of every day, or a special Friday night treat.Take your family dance party to the next level by:


Moving furniture to create space
Curating a playlist of favorite songs
Using scarves, ribbons, or fabric as props
Turning on some fun party lights or a disco ball
Incorporating glow sticks
Wearing fun costumes;
, To play “freeze dance,” one person needs to periodically pause the music. When the music stops, everyone must “freeze” and hold their position. This is a great way to get active, while also working on listening skills.Take turns being the “pause person.”
The “pause person” should be in a place where playing cannot see their hands.
Experiment with staying ”frozen” for longer or shorter periods of time.
If somebody doesn’t freeze (or can’t hold their position), they can be “out.”
Alternatively, you can just dance and freeze without competition!

, Thanks to YouTube, there are millions of dance-instructional videos at our fingertips! Try searching for a beginner-level dance routine to a song that you like. Watch the video and try learning the dance moves together.Learning new dance moves exercises both the body and the mind.
This can provide you with new moves to use in your family dance party!

, If you have three or more players, you can have some fun with musical chairs. Once again, this game incorporates both physical movement and listening skills. All you need is a few chairs (one chair less than the number of players), enough space to place them in a circle, and some music.Arrange chairs in a circle.
You should have one less chair than players. For example, if four people are playing, you should only have three chairs.
Start the music and have the players walk in a circle around the chairs.
When the music stops, each player must quickly find a seat.
The player who is left standing is out.
Remove one chair and play another round. Keep going until you have one winner.

Take a nature walk.,
Go swimming.,
Create an obstacle course.,
Go out to look at Christmas lights.,
Have a scavenger hunt.",How to Keep Kids Busy During Their Holiday Break2," A nature walk is a good way to get kids out into the fresh air, and to allow them to exert some of their built-up energy. Visit a local park or nature trail where kids can't wander far or get lost easily (if you don't have an area in mind, look online for trails and parks near you). To keep kids focused, task them with a particular job during the walk - for example:


picking up sticks or pine cones for an art project
spotting birds, squirrels, or other small animals
looking for things starting with a specific letter (e.g. ""trail"" and ""tree"" for the letter ""T"")

, Swimming is an activity that is fun for kids, as well as calming and energy-burning. Unless you are living in a warm climate and have outdoor swimming options, look up indoor pools in your area to get information on their hours and rates. Be sure to monitor your children at all times while they are swimming and ensure that a CPR-certified lifeguard is on duty at the pool., Creating an obstacle course for your kids is a fun idea that you can customize based on the ages of your children and the space you have to work with.It can also be done indoors or outdoors, weather permitting. Set up clear ""start"" and ""finish"" points, and have obstacles for them to move through in between. Some ideas for safe, kid-friendly obstacles include:hula hoops to hop through
tunnels to crawl through (try draping a sheet over the space between two chairs, turned back to back)
a ""balance beam"" to walk across (a plank of wood, for instance)

, To keep your kids active during the holidays, go out for a walk to look at Christmas lights. This is a great way to get your family moving and drum up their holiday spirit. Cover at least a few blocks in your neighborhood and ask your kids to share what their favorite decorations were, and why.

, To keep your kids active and entertained, set up a themed scavenger hunt. Choose items for your kids to find that match the theme, and have them wear props to get into the fun. For instance, host a magic-themed scavenger hunt - have your kids find items like stuffed rabbits, wands, and playing cards, and have them wear capes or top hats to look like magicians."

Set up play dates.,
Organize a movie night.,
Bring out board games.,
Camp out in the living room.,
Consider a winter day camp.",How to Keep Kids Busy During Their Holiday Break3," Play dates are the perfect solution for kids who might be missing their classmates over the holidays. Run the idea by your child, then get in touch with a parent of the other child (in person or by phone). Be direct and say something like, ""My son really enjoys playing with yours at the playground. Would you be interested in bringing him over sometime for a play date?"" Keep play dates brief (no more than 2-3 hours) and keep a close watch over the children throughout., Watching movies is fun for kids, but it can be even more fun if their friends are involved. Ask a few of your child's friends over to watch a movie and make an event of it - print out admission tickets for each guest and set up a ""snack bar"" where kids can get their own individual bag of popcorn, as well as the candy and beverage of their choice. Turn out the lights, close curtains or blinds, and do your best to recreate a movie theater experience., Board games are an excellent way to gather friends and family to spend quality time together. Playing games can also be educational (e.g. playing Boggle Junior to help with spelling) and teaches lessons about fair play and following rules. Some fun board games to play with children are:Monopoly Junior
Scrabble Junior
Zingo
Junior Labyrinth

, Have your kids invite a friend or two over for a sleepover and camp out in your living room. Set up an actual tent, or make a tent with four chairs and a large sheet to drape over them. Light candles to give the feel of a campfire (making sure to supervise children very carefully) and sleep in sleeping bags if you have them.Make indoor s'mores to further the camping experience.

, There are a variety of winter day camps available for kids over the holidays that allow them to socialize and have fun with other children. These camps can provide entertainment for kids and quality child care for parents who need to work over the holidays, or simply wish to have some time to themselves. Look online for available day camps near you, which may be offered by:


community centers
churches
zoos or aquariums
museums
universities

Use balloons.,
Hula-hoop.,
Play indoor hopscotch.,
Hide and seek.",How to Keep Kids Active Indoors2," Staying active is a lot easier outdoors, but you can have fun inside by transforming outside games into inside ones. Begin by blowing up a balloon. Use this balloon (instead of a ball) to play indoor versions of many games.Place a 6-12” (15.24-30.48cm) piece of masking tape high up on the wall. This is your “basket.” Play a game of balloon basketball by trying to make the balloon contact the wall right above the tape.
Play balloon volleyball by “bumping” the balloon back and forth. Call out a letter with each bump (starting with “A”), and see if you can get through the entire alphabet.
If you have three or more players, you can play “monkey in the middle.” One person is “it.” They stand in the middle of the other players and try to grab the balloon, while the other players try to keep it away from them.
Balloons are a choking hazard for kids 6 and under. Be sure to supervise children closely when they are playing with balloons., If you have a little bit of open space, hula-hooping can be a fun indoor activity. Hula-hooping works the cardiovascular system and helps strengthen muscles. Try hula-hooping along with your kids!Have a hula-hooping contest.
Hoop to fun music!
Try to see who can hoop the longest.
Experiment with hooping the “other way,” or on different parts of your body.
Once again, YouTube can teach some hula-hooping tricks.

, “Hopscotch” is a playground game that involves tossing a rock onto certain boxes, and then skipping these boxes in a hopping pattern. You can adapt this to be an inside game using a large, broken down cardboard box and markers, or a roll of masking tape. Creating the hopscotch board is part of the fun!The traditional hopscotch board is configured as follows:

Three squares that stack vertically, labeled “1,” “2,” and “3.”
Two squares side-by-side, labeled “4” and “5”
One single square, labeled “6”
Two squares side-by-side, labeled “7” and “8”
One single square, labeled “9”


One large semi-circle, labeled either “10,” or “Sky Blue.”
Single squares are to be hopped on by one foot. Side-by-side squares should be hopped on by both feet simultaneously.
Players must advance vertically across the board, turn around at “10”/”Sky Blue” and hop back.
During each turn, one player tosses a rock (or other object) onto the numbers in the sequence (for the first turn, this would be number “1”).
This numbered square is hopped over.
After player one returns, the second player tosses a rock onto number “1.” And so on.
After each player has a turn, round two begins, and player one tosses the rock onto number “2.”
The winner is the first player to toss the rock onto “10”/”Sky Blue” and hop all the way through (both ways) successfully.

, Hide and seek is a classic outdoor game that works great indoors too. Be sure to outline which household places are included in the game, and any spots (such as inside the dryer) that are off limits. This game can go on for as long as desired! There is no ultimate winner.One person who is “it” covers their eyes and counts out loud to a specific number (often 10 or 20).
Meanwhile, all other players quickly find places to hide.
When “it” finishes counting, they announce, “Ready or not, here I come!”
”It” tries to find all of the players.
The last person to be discovered is the next “it.”

Design an obstacle course.,
Teach each other new moves.,
Play dress up.,
Make chores fun.",How to Keep Kids Active Indoors3," A great way to be both active and creative is to design an indoor obstacle course. Using regular household items—blankets, pillows, toys, furniture, cardboard boxes—create a series of physical activities that must be completed in order. Then, see who can complete them the fastest! Time one another and see if you can beat your own times.You can include things like:


Crawling through a blanket tunnel or cardboard box (open on both ends)
Crab walking under a table
Standing on a stable, non-folding chair
Jumping over a stuffed animal

, Chances are both you and your kids know some physical moves that you can teach to one another. Ask your child to show you some of the movements they learned in soccer, karate, ballet, or on the playground. See if you can mimic them. Then show them some moves that you know, perhaps from yoga, Zumba, or your childhood days as a cheerleader. Keep trading moves back and forth until you both get a good workout!, Trying on outfits and playing pretend is not just for little kids. Try playing dress up to stay active on a rainy day. Use designated “dress up” clothes, use your own clothes, or bust out some old Halloween costumes.Come up with characters to go with your outfits!
Put on some music and have a fashion show.
Take funny photos of each of you in your outfits.

, Doing work around the house is a great way to stay active. Additionally, helping with chores instills kids with a sense of responsibility, and makes them feel like an important part of the family unit. But chores don’t have to be boring! Try making your household chores into a game.Race to see how quickly you can work together to clean the house (or just clean up toys).
Play fun music while folding laundry or washing dishes.
Attach sponges to your feet to clean the kitchen floor.

,,, Make sure it is enough to read comfortably. Natural light is best, whether inside or outside. But artificial lighting can be excellent, too, and allow for a more controlled ""studio"" effect. High-wattage reading lamps are terrific. Avoid fluorescent lighting; it is not flattering.

, Many young children hate the surprise from a camera flash.

, Babies are more likely to act cute if they feel comfortable. The fabric can also be a terrific background, especially if it has solid, bright colors.

,, If your baby can hold up her head, she can be placed atop some folded blankets, draped with a soft cloth, facing you. Some children like sitting in their car seat, which you can drape with a cloth to cover it up. Crawlers aren't likely to stay any one place long, so work quick!

, But try to avoid holding the camera directly over your face. Your baby will most likely to react to you and your face, not a boring metal rectangle. If you don't have a tripod mounting, just hold the camera where the baby is in frame, and click when the baby's photogenic.

, You can also sing, talk baby talk, make silly faces, and so on. Be careful to not overwhelm the child by being too animated, however. If you go overboard, your baby will just start crying.

, Babies have minuscule attention spans. You won't get any good photos, and one cranky baby (and/or photographer) if you push it when the baby's tired of this activity.

Add decorations.",How to Create a Baby Memory Book," If you are crafty and interested in hand-making the baby book, a scrapbook is a great option. This style requires an album, printed photos, and art/craft supplies to put together an original and unique baby memory book. You can also purchase a premade baby book, if you don’t want to make the whole thing from scratch. Simply fill in the information and add photos to a premade baby memory book.
Premade baby memory books can be purchased at a variety of baby and book stores.;
, One way to make a memory book is by using a computer program that provides digital templates. Some programs will even allow you to make your own template from scratch. Once completed, you can keep it as a digital memory book or print out a hard copy.Try one of these programs: MyMemories Suite, Memory Mixer, iPhoto, or Adobe inDesign.

, There are online self publishing platforms that you can use to create custom photo memory books. For example, you could use one of these sites: Shutterfly.com, Blurb.com, Mixbook.com, or Pinholepress.com. You design your book through their website and then they print it and mail it to you., Photos are an important part of a baby memory book. You should choose high quality and significant photos to capture your baby’s growth and development. This will help tell the story of your child’s early life. For example, you could include:Pregnancy photos.
An ultrasound photo.
Photos from the hospital.
The first day your baby comes home.
Pictures with different family members.
Photos taken during holidays and special occasions.
Pictures that capture your baby’s milestones (i.e. first time sitting, standing, haircut, etc.).
A monthly photo of your baby from their first year of life.

, Include a page with important details about your baby’s birth. For example, you could include the location or hospital name, name of doctor and nurses, time and date of birth, the baby’s weight and length at birth, and the baby’s hair and eye colour. , There are significant milestones in your baby’s development that you can include in a memory book. These ‘firsts’ are things you will want to remember and are interesting to look back on.Possible milestones to include are: first smile, first laugh, first time sitting up, first time sleeping through the night, first tooth, first solid food, first time crawling, first words, first steps, first haircut, first birthday, etc.

, Besides photos and birth stats you may want to include other significant items from your baby’s early life. For example, hospital bracelet, lock of hair, hand/foot prints, umbilical cord, birth announcement, newspaper notice, etc. These items are connected to your baby and will invoke memories of that time. You could also cut a small piece of fabric from their favourite blanket or article of clothing, once they have outgrown it, to include in their memory book., One way to add a unique personal touch to a baby book is to include anecdotes and stories about your baby and your experiences navigating parenthood. For example, you could include a more detailed note about your baby’s first night sleeping at home.
Alternatively, you could provide more details about your baby’s personality. For example, write about any songs, games, characters, animals, TV shows, etc. that your baby enjoyed.

, Provide a list or photographs of close family members. For example, you could list the names of the baby’s parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins. As you expand your family, it can also be interesting to look back at its beginnings. If you are artistic, you can draw a tree and then label the family members on different branches.
You could also download a family tree template to use.

, In order to set the context of your baby’s first year, you can list major world events. This way, when you are reminiscing years later you can recall what else was going on at that time. Place this information at the end of your baby's first year, so that it does not disrupt the flow of the memory book. For example, you could include:Natural disasters, major political events, or movie/song of the year.
Any famous events that occurred specifically on your baby’s birthday.
The names of famous people who were born on the same day as your baby.

, This is your creation so feel free to add any other information that relates to your baby and that you want to capture in their memory book. , This will show the progression of your baby’s first years and how they changed and grew over that time period. Start the book with the pregnancy or the birth of the baby and have the book continue over the course of the baby’s first year or years. If you adopted your baby, you could begin with adoption forms or the first day you met your baby.

, You can have themed pages in the memory book that focus on specific events or occasions. For example, a page dedicated to Christmas, a family vacation, or birthdays. Photos can also be displayed in groups according to themes, not just chronologically.For example, you could have a “playing with siblings” page that contains photos spanning over time.

, If you are creating a memory book with more than just photos you should group items together. For example, if you include a lock of your baby’s hair you can pair it with a photo of your baby’s first haircut and a related story or anecdote about that experience. This will help to keep the book organized., Making a baby memory book is a creative activity. Have fun with it by adding decorations and your own artistic flare. Use decorations that reflect a general baby theme, such as stickers or images of teddy bears, toys, rattles, bottles, pacifiers, ABC blocks, etc.You can also decorate certain pages to compliment their theme. For example, a bath time page could be decorated with bubbles, rubber duckies, and water drops.
Consider using pastel colours, such as light blue, pink, green, yellow, grey, etc.

Let them voice their frustrations verbally when they are in conflict.,
Congratulate them when the conflict is over.",How to Honor Individuality When Resolving Conflict between Siblings," They can emulate the other's good qualities, but not the bad ones. Different people have different tastes and interests and that is natural and meant to be respected.
, Talk about how they love and care for each other. Bring this up with your children often, as doing so reinforces love and bonding between them. This should help them to remember to love and care for each other., This will foster a mutual caring in each of them. Teach them that good character and happiness is important., Ask them what they think would be the best way to help the other. This way they will be taking some responsibility for each other.

Know that this responsibility becomes a mutual habit for both. They will both end up wanting their sibling to be the best and be happy. Give credit to both of them equally for the success of the other. This will make them want their siblings to do well.

, Instead, try to tell one sibling ""How proud you must be to have him/her as your brother/sister!"" This makes them feel very important and proud of their sibling, and prevents jealousy from creeping in., Make them realize that come what may to you, they are more important than anything else in the world. This gives them a sense of self-worth and a sense of belonging., Warn them not to turn to physical violence and try not to raise their voice. Tell them that since they know each other well and care for each other, they will come to reason and will eventually sort it out., Commend their understanding and their care for one another and their respect for each other's properties and boundaries once they are back to being friends. Tell them that you are proud of them. Don't tell them who was wrong or who was right. Once they learn to respect each other as individuals and understand that they will not be compared, then they will start seeing the foolishness of wasting their time in silly fights. They will learn to let go and remain as friends and be happy."

There are many aspects of photography that can be challenging so it is important to take classes or study with an experienced photographer.


Classes are often available in high schools, community colleges, universities, and through private instruction.
Study commercial photography if it is offered at your educational institution so that you can learn the business and what clients are looking for.;
, The camera is the photographer’s most important piece of equipment. They can be challenging to use on a professional level so it is important to familiarize yourself with different types of cameras and how they work.


Taking photography classes will allow you to learn about how cameras work in-depth and will also give you hands-on experience. You may also learn about different types of cameras, such as manual cameras, pinhole cameras, point-and-shoots, and DSLRs.
There are many online resources that will help you learn how to use a camera, and many of them are free., Lighting is one of the most crucial aspects of photography. Knowing how to properly use lighting will set your images apart from others. Poor lighting will often result in shoddy images. The key to learning about lighting is to experiment!


There are many different types of lighting that are used in photography, such as natural lighting, natural lighting plus fill-in flash, flash photography, ambient lighting, and studio lighting. It is important to study each kind of lighting and learn how to use them in order to become a professional photographer.Classes offered at colleges and universities can help you learn how to use different types of lighting.
There are plenty of online resources to help you learn how to use proper lighting in photography., It is imperative to learn how to use Photoshop to manipulate images from your digital camera. It is rare that an image right from your camera roll will be ready to be professionally distributed. Just as manual cameras require work in the dark room to properly manipulate the photos and film, digital images require work in Photoshop to improve image quality.There are many classes in high schools and colleges that will teach you how to properly use Photoshop and learn common techniques for improving photos.
Photoshop allows you to get creative with your images and digitally alter them in an exciting and creative way.
There are plenty of tutorials available on YouTube if you prefer to learn about the software on your own., Buy at least one professional camera and all of the accessories you will need, including batteries, flashes, a tripod, and any materials you will need to develop, process and print pictures.


There are many online camera purchasing guides that you can utilize to make sure that you are making the best purchase for yourself.Talk to any teachers, professors, friends, or coworkers who you know are experienced in photography to gain a professional opinion on what type of camera you should buy.

, When you are handling babies, it is crucial to wash your hands often to avoid spreading disease to the baby.


Wet your hands under the tap of the sink with clean, running water, apply and lather soap, then rinse hands under warm, running water. Dry off with a clean towel or allow them to air dry.
You can use hand sanitizer periodically as well. However, hand sanitizer will not eliminate all types of germs and is not quite as effective as washing with clean water and soap., Newborns and young infants are not able to regulate their body temperature as well as older children and adults, so make sure that you keep the room or studio toasty warm to ensure that the baby does not get too cold during the shoot.


Set up a space heater or two, depending on the size of the room, but make sure that the baby is a safe distance away from the heater.

, Props are one of the most important parts of a baby photoshoot. Parents will enjoy seeing the cute props, such as pillows and baskets, that can be used to create an endearing shot of the baby.


Pillows not only support the baby, but they can be a great prop for a photo.
Baskets filled with soft, fluffy material, such as blankets, are an excellent prop to use. They can be decorated however you would like, which makes them an easy and flexible prop to work with. They can also last for a long time.
Blankets are great to use for baby photoshoots because they provide a soft, comfortable surface for the baby to lie on. Blankets can come in virtually any shape, material, or color you would like. They are also relatively cheap to purchase.
Poster board can be used to write the baby’s name or age. This is a popular prop in baby photography because anyone who sees the photo will know who the baby is or how old the child was when the photo was taken.

, When posing the baby, you will need someone to spot the baby, which is often mom or dad. Spotting means that someone else will support or hold a part of the baby while they are in a pose.


Spotting can involve holding up the baby’s head with a hand or fingers, holding up a sling with baby in it, or holding and supporting the baby’s arms or legs.
It is highly likely that you will need a spotter when photographing babies, as they can fuss, move around, or are unable to support the weight of their head.

, As a precautionary measure, whenever the baby is lifted off the ground for a pose, place a bean bag immediately under the baby. Always make sure that the bean bag is no more than a foot or two away from the baby.

, Infants are known for their “accidents” which can involve spitting up, sudden bowel movements, or urinating on the props, floor, or someone else (if the child is not wearing a diaper). Have cleaning materials on hand and back-up props to deal with these situations.


Invest in cleaning equipment, such as mops and buckets, disinfecting wipes and sprays, paper towels, and garbage bags and cans. This way you will be prepared for any messes that may occur.
When purchasing props, be sure to purchase back ups just in case an accident occurs on one that you are using for a shoot.

, Composite images are several images that are merged into a single image. The ability to use Photoshop is crucial to creating composite images, as the majority of composite images are created in Photoshop.


Composite images allow you to take pictures while the spotter is holding the baby and then later combine the images to create a single image with no evidence of the spotter.
The use of composite images will make baby photography safer for the baby and will ensure that they are protected while you can still get a great shot.

, In order to become a baby photographer, you will need to show potential employers and clients your work.


Practice photographing babies that you know. If you do not have little ones of your own, ask friends and family members if you can practice by photographing their infants. They will probably not mind, especially if you offer them copies of your prints.
Include samples of posed portraits as well as candid shots.

, Look for baby photographers in your area and ask if they are hiring or could use help. If there are no paying jobs available, ask if you can intern while you gain experience.


Be prepared for a lot of grunt work. If an established baby photographer agrees to let you work with them, you will be busy. It will most likely be your job to fetch supplies, entertain the babies, and manage the paperwork.

, If you cannot find an opportunity working one on one with a photographer, check with studios. Photography centers in stores such as Sears and JCPenney may have openings.


Inquire within at department stores such as Sears or JCPenney to see if there are any openings in their portrait studios. You can also browse the “Career” section of their websites online.
Browse online for photography studios and stores in your area. For example, you can type “Photography studios in Phoenix, AZ” to pull up results for that particular area. Browse the websites that come up in the results to see if there are any openings near you.

, Before you are able to offer your services to anyone, you must form a business entity and register with your county and/or your state. This will allow you to open a bank account and act as a business entity when purchasing supplies and making other decisions.


Once you file for your business entity with the state and it is approved, you are free to start your own small business.

, You do not necessarily need a studio if you are invited into the homes of the parents to take pictures of babies. However, you will need to have the props and proper equipment with you to take high-quality photographs outside of a studio environment.

, Once you have established your business entity and have been paid for your services, you will want to be sure to prepare yourself for taxes. Tax laws vary by state so you will want to be sure that you are acting in accordance with your state’s laws.


Set up an accounting software. Many small business owners use QuickBooks to track their accounting activities. Tracking your income and expenses is crucial for filing taxes., Having a studio will allow you to have a permanent setup for your baby photography that you won’t have to worry about setting up and tearing down every time you have a shoot. A studio will allow you to have your own workspace for creating beautiful images that will last for a lifetime.


Rent studio space. If it is in your budget, you can look for a studio outside of your home to rent. You may need to talk to a real estate agent or browse commercial spaces for rent in your area via online listings. For example, you can type “real estate listings in Detroit, MI” into a search engine to pull up listings in that area.
Use studio space in your home if you have it. A basement or spare room will work for this purpose, as long as you are able to keep the space warm for newborns. You will need just enough space for your equipment, props, and subjects.

, Marketing is an important aspect of building a business. You will need to engage in a lot of marketing at first while you are building your client base and business.


Make a website. A website will be the place where potential clients can get more information about your services and view your portfolio. Making your own website can be easy if you use websites that create templates for you such as Wordpress.com, Wix.com, and Squarespace.com.
Create your own business cards. Websites such as vistaprint.com will print and mail the business cards directly to your home.

, The parents will need to feel like you are friendly, trustworthy and a great photographer as well.


Practice being professional and flexible. It may take time to calm down a crying baby or you may have to deal with angry or concerned clients. Approaching the situation with a level head and positive attitude will help you address the concerns in a constructive way.
For example, if someone is angry with the way the pictures turned out, you can say, “I am so sorry that you are not satisfied with the photos. We can schedule another shoot and I will waive the fees.” If you are calm and collected, you are more likely to calm the client down and come to an understanding.
Work on accepting criticism. Remember that photography is subjective, and sometimes people will not like your pictures.

Ask for your child's opinion.,
Encouraging them to select their own room color can give children a sense of control over their future living environment and help them develop heightened responsibility and maturity levels, regardless of age.

,
Encourage your children to draw or sketch pictures of how they imagine their room will look when the remodel is complete.,
Encourage them to offer input about the artwork and other decorations you intend to add to your newly remodeled space.,
Invite them on your shopping trips.,
Dress your child appropriately for a trip through the worksite and take them on a ""tour"".,
Encourage your child's sense of adventure as the remodel progresses by taking them on ""discovery trips"" to a variety of parks, heavily themed environments, and theater performances.",How to Include Children During a Home Renovation," While your six-year-old probably can't read the design blueprints, he or she might enjoy looking them over with you and discussing the changes you'll be making. Older children might be encouraged to troubleshoot proposed changes, imagining how you and your family will likely use the space you're adjusting and alerting you to possible conflicts.;
,, Discuss the pros and cons of the room they imagine and offer suggestions, lightheartedly. This is a good way to help them visualize the future room and develop their ability to arrange furnishings (bed, dresser, artwork, etc.) thoughtfully.

, The more actively involved your child is in the decorating process, the more excited they will be to see the project complete. This will help keep them enthusiastic throughout the process and instill an appreciation for change that can be reinforced, and reflected upon as your lives progress. If their room is part of the renovation, let them pick out as much as possible for it, from the color and style of bedding and window coverings, to the rugs on the floor.

, As you shop, point out things they might like to add to their redesigned room and listen to their responses. Stay relaxed and make these trips playful and imagination-sparking experiences for them. Help them fine tune their image of their future room by pointing out things you (and they) find atrocious, then let them tell you what they would rather see.

, Show them what happened during the day, or let them tell you what changes they see happening. Discuss how things are progressing with them and ask if they can ""see"" their new space taking shape. Encourage them to explore changes and examine how the work is being done to help them better understand what steps the workers have taken, and what is left to be done. If they spot shoddy workmanship (and they very well may), treat the discovery with the appropriate level of seriousness. Make a mental note to address the concern with the contractor, and offer your child some valued reward for noticing the problem they've spotted.

, While you're out on these jaunts, encourage them to look for things they find particularly appealing (plants, fountains, color schemes, themes, artwork, textures, etc.) and suggest ways to incorporate these things into the design of their new room.

Dress your baby as warmly as you dress yourself, but with a light extra layer.,
Look for soft, warm fabrics.,
Pick out a first layer for your child.,
Create a warm second layer for your child.,
Use the car seat as a test.,
Monitor your baby’s temperature.",How to Dress a Baby Girl in the Winter1," If you are wearing a sweater and jeans, you should dress your baby in a similar manner, but add a light undershirt.


If you put on a coat and hat to go outside, you should do the same thing for your daughter. It can be tempting to over-dress your baby to make sure they are warm enough, but doing so can make them uncomfortable and dangerously hot.;
, Soft fabrics such as fleece and Faux mink or fur are great options for jackets and baby blankets.


For interior layers, look for fabrics that will insulate your baby’s body and not absorb much moisture, such as lycra and silk.
Cotton and linen will not keep your baby as warm as these other materials, as they are very breathable. Save cotton shirts for the summer months.

, Start with a basic layer and add to it as you go outdoors or into colder areas. Your daughter will be fine in a basic layer of a long sleeve onesie, pants, and socks for her first layer.


If you want to put her in a dress or skirt, make sure her legs are covered with tights.

, From the basic layer described in the previous step, you can add things, such as a sweater or light jacket, when you are going outside. Remember to avoid dressing your baby too warmly. In most cases, your child isn’t outside for very long, but she can get uncomfortably hot if left in her outside layers while still inside.

, To be completely effective, car seat straps need to be snug against a baby. If your child can’t fit properly into their car seat, they are wearing too many layers to be inside.


An easy option for small babies in car seats is to cover their entire car seat in bunting or a warm blanket, which can be easily removed once you get inside.

, Get in the habit of constantly checking your baby’s temperature. Due to undeveloped circulatory systems, feeling the hands or feet isn’t a good indication of a baby’s body temperature. Instead, feel their back, stomach, or armpits.


If the area is very hot or the skin is red, your baby may be too hot. If your baby is fussy and inconsolable, it also might be because she is hot.
Your baby may be too cold if they are shivering, or if their armpits or the back of their neck is cold to the touch. Monitoring your baby’s temperature helps keep her comfortable and gives you a good idea of how hot she gets in certain locations and situations.

Pick a jacket out for your child.,
Get a snowsuit for your child.,
Pick out a hat and mittens for your baby girl.,
Apply sunscreen, even in the winter.",How to Dress a Baby Girl in the Winter2," Choose a nice, warm coat with a hood. This will help to keep your girl’s head warm, even if a cold wind picks up.


Jackets that are lined with fleece are good for extra cold locations.

, Once your child is mobile and wants to play outside in the extreme cold, put her in a warm snowsuit with warm lining, such as fleece or cotton. Pick a snowsuit out that you baby girl will love; consider letting her pick it out, so that she will be more inclined to put it on when it is time to play outside.


Mobile babies should also wear waterproof snow boots and thick socks to keep their feet warm and comfortable.
Young babies and infants who can’t walk or crawl don’t need snowsuits, as they can wear thick layers instead. Babies who can’t crawl or walk will be fine wearing thick socks and no shoes.

, Accessories are incredibly important in keeping your baby girl warm, especially when you go outside. When it is snowing, windy, or very cold, be sure to cover her head with a hat that pulls over her ears and cover her hands with mittens.


Some baby sweaters and coats come with sleeves stay on your baby’s hands like mittens.

, If your baby will be outside for a long period of time, don’t forget the sunscreen! Winter sun can be deceptive and is often more powerful than summer sun.


Avoid sun exposure for young babies and block the sun from their skin with layered clothing, a hat, or a light blanket. For children six months or older, apply a baby-safe sunscreen before every outing.

"
"
Don’t use too many blankets.,
Avoid giving a newborn a loose blanket.,
Make sure your child actually needs an extra layer before giving her one.",How to Dress a Baby Girl in the Winter3," It may be tempting to swaddle your baby in multiple blankets to make sure she stays warm all night, but over bundling has been directly linked in an increased risk of SIDS. Your baby will be fine all night in a one-piece fleece pajama sleeper with nothing underneath.

, Newborns should never sleep with loose blankets, as it can be a suffocation risk. Instead, swaddle your baby in a light swaddle blanket made of cotton or muslin.


Wearable blankets, which are sleeveless sacks that zip up the front and are worn over sleepers, are also good options for keeping your baby safe and warm.

, Check your baby’s temperature in the morning as well as the temperature of the room in the night to see if adding a blanket or blanket sleeper will help your child.


The optimal room temperature for a sleeping infant is between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, but this varies with each child. Check your baby’s underarms to see if they are too hot or too cold and adjust their sleeping conditions accordingly.

Evaluate the circumstances of the photo.,
Exclude photos with identifiable landmarks.,
Consider how your baby may feel about it in fifteen years.,
Ask other parents for permission to post group pictures.",How to Safely Post Photos of Your Baby Online1," Certain types of photographs are safe to post. These include professional photoshoots, family pictures, photos of the baby smiling, or snapshots of the baby playing. Other photographs should never be posted online. These are photos that could potentially endanger the child or that could be shared for criminal purposes on the internet.


Do not post pictures of your baby in the bath or on the toilet, nor should there be any naked pictures of your baby online.
Do not post pictures of your baby engaging in any unsafe activities. Even if you were there to watch them, these photos may misinterpreted by others. For example, a picture of your baby dangling off an edge might be funny to you, but it may cause alarm from other people.;
, If you are concerned about people seeing and locating your baby, you should make sure that any photos you post do not reveal where you live or where your baby attends daycare. Avoid photographs that may reveal this information.Identifiable landmarks include street signs, local storefronts, or numbers on the front of your house.

, A photo that is cute now may cause embarrassment for your child down the road. Since it can be hard to completely erase a photograph from the internet, you should only post pictures that portray your child in a positive light. Keep in mind that these photos may be shared and that your child may encounter them throughout their lives.Avoid using photos to shame your child. Even if your baby is not on social media now, they may be in the future.
Photos of sick children, especially pictures that display vomiting or diarrhea, may make both your child and your friends uncomfortable., If you have pictures of your baby with other children, ask the parents of the other children if they are comfortable with the picture being posted online. Respect their decision if they say they do not want it online.Always tell the other parent where you are posting the picture when asking. You can say, “I have this cute picture of our two babies together. Do you mind if I post it on Facebook?”
If they don’t mind you posting the picture, you should ask, “Do you want me to tag you in it or not?”
If you still want to post the picture online, you might decide to crop the other children out of it.

Read the terms and conditions.,
Set your photos to private.,
Use a photo-sharing website.,
Turn off location services.,
Ask others to follow your rules.",How to Safely Post Photos of Your Baby Online2," When you post a picture online, you are agreeing to the policies that the host website has asserted. Some websites may claim ownership over all photos that you post to their platform. This will include photos of your baby. To ensure that you understand the website’s policies, read through its terms of use and privacy policies carefully.


Many social media sites retain the right to “sub-license” your photos. This means that they can sell them to a third-party. The terms and conditions may state that they can do this “royalty-free”—in other words, without paying you., On most social media sites, you have the power to limit who can and cannot see your images. Go to your account settings, and select the privacy option.You may have the option to:


Only allow specific users to see your photos of your baby
Refuse other social media users the right to share your photograph
Deny friends of your friends the ability to see the picture
Refuse other people the ability to tag your image (thus preventing it from appearing on feeds and profiles of strangers)

, If the risk of a social media site is too high for you, you can also upload your baby’s pictures to a photo-sharing website. These websites, which include Flickr and Photobucket, offer you the ability to make private albums. You can then send the link to the album to particular family members and friends. They will not be able to share or send these photos as they might be on other sites.You can also upload the photos to a file sharing platform like Google Drive or Dropbox. Create a file for the pictures, and share that file with family and friends by typing in their emails.

, Most websites use a form of location services that can potentially identify your exact location at any time. If you are worried about people finding out where you and your baby live, you should turn off all location services on your social media websites.Geotagging is disabled by default on Facebook and Twitter, but you will still have the option to manually “pin” your location. Avoid using this feature when posting baby pictures.If you take pictures on your phone, make sure that your phone is not recording where the image is taken. You can do this by going to settings, and hitting the option for location services. Turn it off for the phone’s camera.

, In addition to policing your own profile, you will need to make sure that all family members and friends understand these rules, as they may want to post their own pictures of your baby. Decide if you are comfortable with them posting pictures. If you are, let them know how private you want the pictures to be.


If you don’t want them posting at all, you can say, “I’m very worried about my baby’s privacy online, and I would appreciate it if you didn’t post any pictures of them on social media or other websites.
If you’re fine with them posting, you can say, “If you don’t mind, I’d appreciate it if you only shared that picture within our family or friend group. I don’t want strangers to potentially see pictures of my baby.”

Watermark your photo.,
Lower the resolution of the photograph.,
File take-down requests.",How to Safely Post Photos of Your Baby Online3," You should avoid putting as much personal information as you can about your baby online. To protect the baby’s identity, avoid using their name on social media. You can use a nickname or their initials instead.

Over the photo, type your name over the photograph in gray font. You can edit the size, transparency, and font of the text.
You can also use an app, such as A+ Signature or Marksta, to add a watermark., Before posting the picture online, try lowering the resolution so that the picture is less attractive to steal. The quality of the photograph will still be good enough for your family to enjoy, but others will not be able to print or enlarge it as easily.To do this in Photoshop, go to Image on the toolbar and select Image Size. A dialog box will pop up. Uncheck the box that says “Resample Image” and type in a new resolution. You may want to type in half of the original resolution.
Some online programs may also allow you to resize a file.

Select 12 size- or age-appropriate onesies.",How to Make Month Birthday Onesies1," You don’t need to find expensive clothing for this project, in fact you want a plain, one-color onesie.


Choose the right age/size for each progression. For example, for month two, you’ll most likely need a onesie sized for a newborn from zero to three months.
Consider the child’s potential size. If the baby has not been born or is still very new, consider if the baby is large or small for his or her size. Premature babies typically are a few sizes smaller than their actual age, whereas some babies are born wearing clothing suited for a six month old.;

Get a prescription for your child.,
Understand that some medications will make your child sleepy.,
Help your child get into a comfortable position.,
Give your child something to drink to clear the fluid from her ears.,
Limit the amount of dairy your child consumes.",How to Get a Baby with an Ear Infection to Sleep1," When you notice that your child is in pain, contact your pediatrician right away. He or she will be able to diagnose the ear infection and prescribe medication that will help your child to overcome the infection. Your pediatrician will most likely prescribe antibiotics, and possibly some pain medication. Follow the doctor’s orders when giving your child the medication.


Trust your instincts when it comes to bringing your child to the doctor. Because children have a hard time expressing what they are feeling, it is up to you to figure out when your child needs a doctor. Trust your instincts; if your baby does not look or act as if she feels well, you should consider taking her to the doctor.;
, Many times, pain relievers will relax your child so that she will fall asleep. Sometimes the pain relievers will have something in them that may even help your child to become sleepy.


If this is the case, your baby may be sleepy for a couple of days as the medication works its way through her system.

, Ear infections can make it hard to lie down. A baby with an ear infection may be more comfortable being held. She may need to be propped up on a pillow or have a wedge placed under her crib mattress so that she is not lying down in a completely flat position.


If your child’s ears have fluid in them from the infection, then lying flat on her back will cause pressure that feels like all the air has just been sucked out of the room. Propping your child up will help the Eustachian tubes in her ears to clear out, and it will relieve some of the pressure.

, Ear infections may cause pain and/or discomfort when eating or drinking so it may sound strange to recommend giving your child a drink. However, drinking a few sips of water or juice can help to stimulate the muscles in and near the Eustachian tubes in your child’s ears.


When these muscles are stimulated, they can clear the fluid out of your child’s ears more efficiently. That means that the tubes in your child’s ears can open and begin to clear; this will help to reduce your child’s pain and allow her to sleep more soundly.

, If at all possible, try to limit the amount of milk and dairy that your baby consumes when she has an ear infection. Dairy products increase the mucus in your child’s body and make it hard for the tubes to drain fluids away effectively.

Distracting her while also soothing her may help her to fall asleep despite the pain she is feeling.

, While rocking can generally help a baby fall asleep, the back-and-forth movement may not help a child with an ear infection. This is because that rocking movement can move the fluid in your child’s ears around, causing pain.


Follow your baby’s lead; if she seems fine being rocked, then continue to rock her until she doesn’t want to be rocked anymore.

Make sure the baby isn't too warm.,
Try feeding your baby.",How to Get a Baby to Sleep Through the Night1," Make sure your expectations are reasonable.;
, High pitched, intense crying for more than three hours a day means that your baby is experiencing colic, which experts believe may be related to intestinal development issues, acid reflux, or food allergies.


Try different resting positions for your baby. The ""colic carry,"" with the baby positioned so that his/her stomach rests on your forearm and his/her head rests in your palm, can be a calming position.
Massage your baby's back to help release pent-up gas that might be causing the colic.
Rock your baby in a steady, relaxing motion. A ride in the car or a walk in the stroller can soothe your baby and help him/her fall asleep.
Colic usually begins when the baby is about two weeks old and ends by the time the baby is 12-14 weeks old.

,


Place a cold compress on your baby's gums. Soak a wet washcloth in water and chill it in the freezer until it is cold enough to soothe but not too cold for your baby (about one hour).

Know that swaddling is a controversial practice, especially if started after the child is several months old. In some studies, swaddling increased the chance of SIDS, or sudden infant death syndrome, significantly.In many societies, however, swaddling is a common practice. To ensure that your child is safe and sound during the night, make sure the your child sleeps on his or her back (instead of on their tummy) and try breastfeeding regularly., This approach uses the theory that sleeping is a skill that your baby can learn on his/her own, however, the pediatrician who coined the term has since recanted. Babies do not have the capacity to 'self-sooth'; in truth, a baby stops crying when it realizes that no one is going to help it; the baby has given up. This is a horrific form of neglect and is both psychologically and physically dangerous.

Look for sharp edges or rough spots. This could include improperly sanded wood on the crib frame, metal protrusions, and improperly fastened screws.
Check the mattress support hooks. Be sure the mattress cannot accidentally flip and entrap the child.
Make sure there are no gaps larger than two fingers between the sides of the crib and the mattress so the baby's body cannot slip out.
Avoid corner posts over 1/16th inch high so a baby's clothing cannot catch.

If you have a warranty in effect, keep the documentation in a safe and secure place.
A recall may be issued through the store, manufacturer, or government so stay informed on these fronts.

, If the crib is not a comfortable option, the bassinet is a simpler choice that sometimes is used for the first few months of infancy, and even passed through families.Be sure the bassinet is cleaned appropriately if it is a re-used one.
Check that the bassinet sits firmly on its stand. You should be keeping the bassinet/stand near the bed of the parent(s).
Examine the bassinet and the stand for loose parts or linens.
Use only the authorized mattress (or padding) and fitted sheet for the bassinet. Always make sure you use sheets that will fit snugly around the mattress--check the dimensions for a match.

Cover the baby only as high as his/her chest.

, If the baby or toddler is tall enough and old enough to climb out frequently, it may be time to switch to a bed.Parents can delay the transition somewhat by lowering the mattress (if possible) or raising the rails (if possible).
The transition can happen frequently between ages 1 1/2 to 3 1/2
Parents may need to coax the child from the crib to a bed with a ""party"" or having them select the bed themselves.

, This is one of the most serious threats to an infant while in the crib. It's cause is largely still unknown.Babies that were born premature and at low-birth-weight seem at higher risk for SIDS.
Babies whose mothers didn't get medical care during the pregnancy, mothers who smoked, and situations where twins or multiple babies were born also posed greater risk for SIDS occurring
Regarding cribs and sleeping, when babies sleep on their bellies or sides (and roll over onto their bellies), they may not breathe well and increase the risk of SIDS.

, There are no warning signs before hand at all.Babies who die of SIDS seem healthy before being put to bed.
SIDS victims show no signs of struggle, and are often found in the same position as when they were placed in the bed.

, SIDS is diagnosed usually when no other cause of death can be found.


Medical experts review the baby's and parents' medical histories
Doctors will study the area where the baby died
An autopsy is also performed.

, These are steps you can take when caring for your baby in its crib especially during sleep times to reduce the risk of SIDS.Be sure the baby is sleeping on its back. Check periodically to ensure he or she has not rolled over.
For at least the first six months after birth, allow the baby to sleep in their crib/bassinet in the same room as the parent(s).
Check periodically that no foreign objects including additional bedding are in your baby's crib.
Test the crib mattress for firmness and ensure its attachment is secure frequently.
Make sure the fitted sheet is not slipping off the mattress corners.
After your baby is about a month old, consider giving them a pacifier at nap/sleep times.

, There is no sure way to prevent or test for SIDS. If the unfortunate should happen, consider joining a support group for grief counseling.Look for SIDS-specific support groups.
Consult a psychologist.
Talk with family, friends, and/or clergy.

Take advantage of the neutral color scheme.,
Use grays and blues for your main colors.,
Add other ocean colors for accents.,
Paint nautical murals on the wall.",How to Design a Nautical‐Themed Nursery1," A nautical nursery is often appealing if you want something gender neutral. Traditionally gendered colors, like pinks and blues, can both be present as undertones in a nautical nursery. When deciding on your color scheme, you can disregard your baby's gender as a defining factor., The ocean is comprised mainly of gray and blue shades. Therefore, rely on this for your main color scheme. Carpets, walls, and furniture should be in varying shades of grays and blues.There is no need to use one shade. The ocean has many different layers and colors, so you can mix and match a variety of grays and blues.
If you feel blue is too gendered of a color, you can stick to varying shades of gray or use a more grayish blue to downplay the gender factor.

, There are many other colors found in the ocean. Hints of shades caused by the reflection of the sun can give your nautical nursery some added flavor. Try throwing in splashes purples, pinks, and greens throughout your nursery.For example, you could have a dresser with sea-green knobs or a changing table with pink polka dots.
Decorations can also follow the color scheme. When selecting things like mobiles and stuffed animals, go for ocean-based colors.

, Plain walls are one option for a nursery, but it can be fun to paint murals over the crib or along one wall. You can paint things like whales, starfish, coral reefs, ships, sailors, and other nautical images. If you're adept at arts, you can paint murals yourself. If you're not into painting, you can hire a painter or have an artistic friend help you.Stick to your color scheme when adding murals. Use colors like grays, blues, greens, purples, and pinks to reflect the nautical theme.

Begin with the crib.,
Transition to the princess' bed.,
Choose princess themed bedding.,
Use princess wall murals.,
Find suitable princess themed window dressings.,
Add a princess light and lamps.,
Choose suitable pictures for the walls.,
Add decorative effects.",How to Decorate a Princess Themed Nursery," You have two options here––one, purchase a crib designed with princesses in mind and two, decorate an existing crib with a princess style. In the first case, if your budget permits, you might like to look for a crib made to look like a carriage––there are a few of this style available; do a search online for examples. Alternatively, look for a crib that has princess themes already painted or designed onto the crib. For the more budget conscious, consider transforming the existing crib into a princess themed one. Use non-toxic paint to add pinks and purples, and non-toxic glues to decoupage princess decals or designs onto the crib.


Be careful if adding any embellishments to a crib. Babies are curious and will pull, chew and lick things within their reach, which can potentially turn some things into choking or toxic hazards. Don't tie ribbons, string, or other things to the crib and don't use anything toxic when decorating the crib. If in doubt, leave it out.;
, Once your little princess is past crib stage, she'll need a bed fit for a princess. Here your options broaden and a pretty bed will last much longer than a crib, so you might be able to splurge a little more on a princess-themed bed. Again, look online for choices. However, you can decorate the bed easily yourself. For example, add a decal of a favorite princess onto the headboard or decoupage cut-outs of princesses and princess things to the headboard.

, This is where you have a lot of leeway to create any kind of princess look, relying on beautiful colors, luxurious fabrics, lace, pillows, etc. to make the entire bed suitable for a princess. While pink is an obvious choice, don't overlook other regal colors such as red, purple, gold and green. Ask your little princess what her favorite color is––it's not always pink!


Disney stores and other stores carrying Disney merchandise may have princess themed sheet sets and duvet covers.
Generic prints of princess images and princess related items can be found printed on all sorts of fabrics. If you're good with a sewing machine, consider making your daughter's sheet sets and duvet covers from such fabrics. Look online as well as in stores––some online stores and auction sellers specialize in finding suitable fabrics.
If you enjoy quilting, making a quilt fit for a princess can be an enjoyable project. Your little princess will treasure having this over her bed.

, Wall murals that can be added and peeled off are a great way to dress up the nursery. When your daughter is tired of them or outgrows them, they can be rearranged or removed. This might be a better option than using wallpaper with princess designs, which requires complete removal when your child grows older.

, It is possible to purchase curtains with princess images, or you might like to sew your own using princess fabric. Since this is a room for a princess, consider using rich fabrics to add an air of elegance.


Lace is an ideal option for the inner curtains; it's pretty and very much what a princess would adore.
Be careful if using tassels as curtain hold-backs; it is better to use simple hold-backs made from fabric as they aren't likely to be chewed on by a curious princess.

, While it's not practical to have a chandelier in a child's bedroom, you can opt for a light cover in a pretty hue of pink or choose one with princess images imprinted onto it. Alternatively, simply choose light covers and lampshades that have a pretty design or well adhered decorations.

, Using framed pictures, posters and images on wood blocks that feature princesses, castles, knights, tiaras, etc. can help to increase the princess feel of the room.

, Consider using princess accessories to decorate the room. For example, make a mobile using a tiara as the head of the mobile and hang princess pictures from it. Or, arrange tiaras on a shelf, hanging on a wall or dangling off the end of the bed. Hang a princess fairy wand on the wall, use silk flowers to make decorative displays and put princess dolls along a shelf. Other beautiful princess related additions include using symbols such as butterflies, gems, roses, swans, the fleur de lys, white horses or unicorns, etc.


A pretty music box is essential for a princess themed room. Choose one with something associated with princesses used as the design or simply get one that is extremely elegant and that has pretty music.
Make sure that all decorations are either safe for handling by the baby or child or keep them well out of reach.

Choose a sailboat bookshelf.,
Decorate the crib with nautical blankets.,
Embellish non-nautical furniture.,
Purchase a lighthouse lamp.",How to Design a Nautical‐Themed Nursery2," You can buy a bookshelf online or possibly from a local furniture store shaped like a sailboat or canoe. This can be a cute way to add to the nautical theme of your nursery. Having a sailboat propped up against the wall will make visitors notice the ocean setting.If you opt for a mural, try placing the bookshelf near the mural. You can do something like paint sand near the floor and fish floating around the sail boat. This can create a sunken ship effect.

, If you want your crib to have a nautical look, purchase nautical blankets online or at a baby supplies store. A blanket decorated with things like anchors, boats, or fish, for example, can really solidify the nautical theme., Not every piece of furniture in your nursery needs to be nautical-themed. Plain dressers, cabinets, and shelves are okay as you do not want to go overboard. However, be sure to embellish this furniture with nautical decorations.For example, line a mantel with nautical-themed toys.
If you don't mind painting on a piece of furniture, try using stencils to paint things like starfish and whales on a dresser or cabinet.

, A lighthouse lamp is a lamp shaped like a lighthouse. This can be a cute decoration for a nautical-themed room. See if you can buy a lighthouse lamp online or find one at a furniture store.Websites like Etsy often have specialized orders. This is a great place to look for a lighthouse lamp.

Add nautical paintings.,
Decorate with stuffed whales.,
Hang up a life preserver.,
Make use of nets.,
Purchase nautical mobiles.",How to Design a Nautical‐Themed Nursery3," You can purchase nautical paintings at an art store, online, or at a craft fair. Hanging up paintings of things like ships, whales, marine life, and sailboats contribute to the nautical theme.Choose good places to put the paintings. Position them in places where the room looks a bit bland. For example, if there is a lot of wall space over a mantel, hang a painting there.
Do not place paintings over the crib. They could fall and harm the baby.

, Stuffed whales are a cute decoration for a nautical nursery. They can also be toys for your baby as they grow old enough to play with stuffed animals. You can place whales on the furniture throughout your nursery. Whales on bookshelves, cabinets, and dressers really speak to the nautical theme.You could even set up an ocean scene on a mantel. Lay down blue decorative paper or fabric over the mantel. Add a sailboat and place a toy whale nearby. This will look like sailors are encountering a whale on their journey.

, You can buy an old life preserver online or even get one secondhand from a public pool. Hammer a nail into your wall and then hang up the life preserver. This is a cute decoration for the room that speaks to the nautical theme., Nets can be hung up in corners and used to store supplies. Things like stuffed toys, clothing, and even heavier objects like books can be stored in nets. Not only does this contribute to the nautical theme, it helps you keep the floor free of clutter.


Nets are also great because they can be used to store toys as your baby gets older.

, Mobiles can be very soothing to infants and babies. Try choosing a mobile with a nautical theme. Go for things like starfish, sea horses, anchors, or other nautical decorations when choosing a mobile."

Research theories regarding different color themes, lighting levels and furniture arrangement, as well as both the effect that these elements can have on the development of a child and the effectiveness of a nursery.,
Decorate your nursery around a favorite storybook or film character.,
Go for the traditional route by featuring idyllic scenes, letters and numbers, or colors and patterns on the wall of your nursery.,
Base your decorating theme around a specific object or accessory.,
Carefully select window treatments that can both block out harsh sunlight for better napping and let sunlight in to make the nursery feel fresh and open.,
Be sure to include safety measures in the design of your baby's nursery.,
Choose corresponding baby furniture to include in the nursery.,
Include stimulating accessories in the nursery that your baby can use to encounter the world and discover new colors, shapes and sounds.,
Paint a mural on the nursery walls to depict your chosen theme.,
Photograph your baby's nursery after it is completed so that you always have memories of your baby's first room.

",How to Choose a Baby Nursery Theme," Some researchers suggest bold, primary colors like bright red, yellow and blue to stimulate a baby's neurotransmitters while others suggest pastel colors of blues, greens, and violets to create a soothing environment that promotes healthy sleep patterns. Since your baby's nursery will most likely be the room that your child spends most of his or her time in during the first few years of life, this room should be airy, functional and attractive.


Look through baby magazines and online baby room databases to get ideas for decorating your baby's nursery. There are thousands of resources in print and online that can help you discover new decorating trends and innovative ideas for decorating a baby's room.;
, Many parents decide to create a baby nursery theme around a favorite character from children's literature or film. You can search for infant bedding that features a beloved character and then choose paint colors that will correspond with this theme.

,


Some parents who plan on having more than one child may wish to create a nursery that can be functional for both genders. Colors such as yellow and green are gender neutral and can be featured in a boy's or girl's nursery.
Make note of the effect the color scheme may have on your baby. Bold, primary colors are considered to be visually stimulating while pastels are considered to be soothing and comforting.

, For example, if you find a mobile for your baby's crib that you simply adore, you can take the mobile to a paint store and choose corresponding colors for the walls. You can then find matching bedding and other accessories, which will make the mobile a focal point. Any favorite item can become the focal point around which you create your baby's nursery theme.

, Heavy drapes can achieve both of these purposes. Some health experts caution parents to avoid floor-length drapes because fabric can become entangled around a small child's neck. Thin fabrics are more dangerous than heavy, upholstered fabrics. Avoid using mini blinds, roman shades, or venetian blinds in your child's nursery as the hanging cords can also present a choking hazard.

,


Electrical equipment and heavy items should be kept out of reach of small children.
Electrical outlets should be covered with safety covers so that children cannot accidentally electrocute themselves.
Baby cribs, bassinets, changing tables and other accessories should abide by safety standards.

, All pieces of furniture should feature the same wood finish to create a consistent and open look in the nursery. Popular furniture items include a crib or bassinet, a changing table, a dresser, a storage chest and a rocking chair or glider.

,


Mobiles, music players, children's literature and educational toys can all be valuable assets to a functional nursery.
Be sure that accessories are appropriate for newborn children and that they don't present any choking or strangulation hazards or tipping hazards. Furniture should be too heavy for a child to push over. Lamps should have short cords that stretch to electrical outlets without any slack. Furniture knobs should be tightly affixed to the furniture so that they cannot be pulled off and swallowed.

, If you want to include a mural of a nursery rhyme scene or storybook scene on the wall, you can accomplish this with a simple grid design.


Find and print an image that you want to feature on the wall.
Carefully draw a grid of small squares over the image. Then, draw a larger grid on the wall where you want the mural featured. The larger the grid on the wall in proportion to the image, the larger the mural will be.
Fill in each grid square with the corresponding lines in the image grid square. This will help you create a perfectly proportioned, professional looking sketch on the wall. Fill in the appropriate colors with paint.

Place a crib next to the bed.,
Choose a bedside sleeper.,
Move the baby to another room between six and twelve months.",How to Co Sleep Safely With Your Baby1," If you want to room-share, place a bed for your baby right next to yours. You can put a bassinet, crib, cot, or play yard in the room. You can be close to your baby, but reduce the dangers of bed-sharing., If you want to be closer than a crib, you can place a bedside sleeper on your bed. This bed attaches directly to the bed so you can be next to your baby, but keeps you separated on different surfaces., If you co-sleep with your baby, you should do this until around 12 months of age. However, if you want to move them to their own room before that, wait until they are at least six months old."

Buy a larger bed.,
Sleep in a “C” position.,
Make sure your baby is warm but not hot.,
Tie your hair back.,
Place the baby on their back.",How to Co Sleep Safely With Your Baby2," You should only co-sleep with your baby on firm mattresses. Soft and sagging mattresses may cause your baby to overheat or suffocate. The mattress should fit the bed frame snugly, with no gaps between the mattress and headboard, frame, or wall.Avoid co-sleeping on feather beds, air mattresses, and waterbeds.

, Heavy blankets can lead to overheating and suffocation. Instead, use light sheets and thin blankets. Avoid flannel sheets and heavy comforters or duvets.If you use heavier blankets, never cover the baby’s head with it.
Make sure the sheets fit the bed so there’s no risk of the baby getting tangled up in loose sheets.

, Your baby shouldn’t be surrounded by pillows or stuffed animals. Sleeping on pillows or with pillows around them can cause the baby to roll off or end up wedged between the pillows, which can cause suffocation., You may want to put the mattress on the floor instead of on the bed frame. This may make you feel safer since your baby won’t be at risk for falling off the side of the bed to the floor.This may be preferable once your baby starts moving around a lot.

, The best bed for co-sleeping is a king-sized bed. This size gives enough room for you, your partner, and the baby. If your bed is too small, you or your partner may want to sleep on the floor or in another room so there is enough room to co-sleep on the bed., When you co-sleep, you should sleep in the right position. The “C” position helps keep your baby safe. Sleep on your side, with your body curled around your baby like a “C.” Put your forearm above the baby’s head and your knees under their feet.This positions helps you avoid rolling away or towards your baby, and keeps your pillow away from your baby.

, Overheating is a big concern with co-sleeping. Your baby should be warm and able to regulate their temperature.Keep the head uncovered, which will help their core temperature adjust as needed. Place them in their regular pajamas when you sleep.

, If your hair is long, you should tie it back. Long hair can get tangled around the baby’s body. Co-sleeping with long hair presents a danger of the hair getting wrapped around the baby’s neck, which can lead to suffocation.You can pull your hair into a ponytail, braid it, or place it in a bun.

, When sharing a bed with your baby, the baby should always sleep on their back. This is the same as the way they would sleep in a crib. Don’t place the baby on their stomach or side when co-sleeping."

You or your partner should always been in the bed with the baby. Even stepping away for five minutes could pose a risk for your baby.If you leave the room, your baby may roll off the bed or end up wedged between something.

, When you co-sleep with your baby, they should not be placed between two adults in the bed. This can increase the risk of overheating and suffocation. Being between the adults can also increase the likelihood that the baby will get rolled on.The baby should be placed on one side of one of the parents, with that parent facing the baby. The parent’s back should be toward the other adult in the bed.

, Co-sleeping in unsafe conditions can increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). To keep your baby safe, never sleep with them on a sofa or armchair.Sleeping with your baby on this furniture can cause your baby to overheat and suffocate.
Your baby may become wedged between the cushions or between your body and the furniture.

, The danger of SIDS for your baby increases if you take any substances that are considered depressants or alter your mental state. Never co-sleep with your baby if you ingest anything that makes you drowsy.For example, you should not co-sleep with your baby if you have been drinking alcohol or if you take any medication or drugs that will make you drowsy or sleepy.
These substances can alter your thought processes, which can lead to you forgetting that your baby is in the bed with you. You may also sleep too deeply and accidentally roll over onto the baby.

, The smoke on your clothes or body can lead to suffocation in your infant. You shouldn’t co-sleep if you or your partner smokes or uses e-cigarettes.Even if you don’t smoke at home or in bed, you still shouldn’t co-sleep with your baby. The smoke remnants can lead to respiratory distress.

, If possible, discourage other children, especially toddlers, from sleeping in the bed with you and your baby. They may accidentally roll on top of the baby or cover the mouth and nose. If your other child needs to sleep with you, place an adult between the baby and the other children.
If your toddler doesn’t understand that you need to focus on your baby, you can place the baby on a cot or crib near you instead of co-sleeping with them.

, Babies that were born premature should not placed in the same bed as you. Low birth weights, such as less than 5.5 lbs or 2.5 kgs, can also increase the risk of SIDS., You should never share a bed with your baby if you are too tired or exhausted. This can make it more difficult to wake or lead to you rolling on top of your baby or not hearing them if they are distressed.You should also not share a bed with your baby if you have conditions that make it difficult for you to wake up or be roused from sleep, like sleep apnea.

Measure the width and length of your crib.,
Check the firmness of the mattress you are purchasing.,
Decide whether you prefer a foam or an innerspring mattress.,
Choose a mattress with a very thick cover, which is also known as ticking.,
Verify that the mattress has been certified.,
Inspect the mattress for vent holes.,
Consider an organic mattress if you are concerned with the human-made chemicals, such as flame retardants that are in standard mattresses.",How to Choose a Baby Crib Mattress," Though standard crib mattresses are required to be a minimum of 27-1/4 inches (69.2 cm) wide by 51-5/8 inches (131.4 cm) long; some mattresses are larger to fit larger cribs. Purchase a mattress that fits your crib snugly.;
, Your new crib mattress needs to be very firm to reduce the risk of your baby suffocating due to sinking into a softer surface. There is an easy test that you can do to confirm that your baby's mattress is safely firm enough.

,


Foam options tend to be less expensive, but you must make sure that the foam is firm and dense and doesn't allow the baby to sink into the mattress.
Innerspring mattresses typically cost more but offer higher durability. If you choose innerspring, select a mattress that has between 135 to 150 coils with a gauge lower than 15.5. These numbers should be found on the packaging. These guidelines are set by Consumer Reports and will guarantee the mattress you choose is firm enough for your baby.
Consider purchasing a dual-sided mattress: usually one side is designed for babies and the other for toddlers, extending the mattress lifespan considerably.

, The best mattress options have multiple layers of laminate coating that's been strengthened with nylon. These mattress choices have the added benefit of increased durability, which means less chance of tears or holes.

, This means it has met the standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and is safe for use.

, A quality mattress should have small reinforced holes on both sides that allow air to circulate in and out of the mattress interior. These vents will help keep the mattress fresher by allowing odors to escape.

, Because these mattresses can be very expensive, and not all products labeled organic are truly 100% natural, make sure the one you choose has been certified by Oeko-Tex Standard 100. This certification insures that the mattress is free of heavy chemicals and metals.

Use a bathroom scale to measure your child’s weight. Then, measure your child’s height with a tape measure. Have your child stand against a wall, mark the top of their head with a pencil, and measure their height with a tape measure. Finally, divide the child’s weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.If you prefer working in feet and inches, you can divide the child’s weight in pounds by their height in inches squared and then multiply it by 703.You can also use an online BMI calculator, but make sure it is specifically for children and teenagers— such as the one here: https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/calculator.aspx — and not for adults. Simply fill in the required information on size, weight, age and all other fields. Then press calculate.
Download charts that show BMI-for-age. Go to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and search BMI-for-age. You will see charts that are available for free to download for both boys and girls. Compare your child’s BMI to what is normal for their age, height, and sex.A child whose BMI is equal to or greater than the 5th percentile and less than the 85th percentile is considered a healthy weight for their age.
Most pediatricians also measure and track BMI at regular check-ups and can provide you with the information and/or charts.;
, Your doctor will measure the fat around your child’s belly. They will measure the circumference at the natural waist, which is in between the lowest rib and the top of the hip bone. This method is inexpensive and fairly accurate; however, some doctors may not be able to tell you whether your child is overweight from this information alone., Your doctor will measure your child’s abdominal obesity. They will measure the circumference of your child’s waist and then their hips. They will then divide your child’s waist by hip measurements. There are two places where your doctor could possibly measure wrong but they should be able to do it fairly accurately., Your doctor will use a caliper to measure the thickness of a pinch of skin or fat in various parts of the body. They may measure the trunk, thighs, front and back of the upper arm, and then under the shoulder blade. Doctors will then use an equation to predict overall body fat percentage. It is a fast and easy method, which is safe and inexpensive. However, it is not as accurate as other methods., Your doctor will send a safe electrical current through your child’s body. The current encounters more resistance passing through fat than through water and muscle. Your doctor will use an equation to measure body fat percentage. It is convenient, safe, and relatively inexpensive. It relies on relatively normal ratio of body water to fat, but this can change during illness or otherwise. It is not as accurate as some other methods.Your doctor may use one or more methods to measure body fat, alongside the body mass index, to determine whether or not your child is overweight.

, looking at the pattern of growth, including weight, is more important than looking at one value. Looking at how the weight has changed over time can be very important when determining if your child is overweight. Certain factors, such as entering puberty, can have a bearing on whether your child is at a healthy weight. Your doctor can look at BMI measurements from previous visits to determine whether your child may be at risk for becoming overweight., You should focus on having an upbeat and informative conversation about healthy eating habits such as relatively small and diverse portions. Throughout the conversation, you should communicate your love and support. Make sure they know it is not their fault and that obesity is a complex issue. Avoid words like greedy, fat, or lazy, which will erode self-esteem.If the child is under nine years of age, make changes to the family diet as a whole. You don’t need to talk to your child. Rather, change what the family eats.If your child is 10 or older, you may want to talk to them directly about food and weight. They will likely already be thinking about these topics so now is the time for open dialogue.You must still make changes as a family, however, even for older children.

, If you see your child making good food decisions such as finishing their healthy dinner or skipping a sugary snack, you should offer praise. Encourage them to continue making wise food choices.


For example, if you see your child make a healthy salad for lunch, you might say: “That looks both healthy and delicious. It is great to see you figuring out recipes that work for you. You’ll have to teach me how to make it!”

, If you notice your child gaining weight and want to say something, it is best to avoid saying negative things to your child.


For example, if you pick your child up from school and you notice their weight in comparison to their peers, try to avoid making negative comments. Avoid saying things like, “Wow, you really have put on some pounds these last few months!” These kinds of negative statements harm your child’s self-esteem.

, Criticizing or fretting over your child's weight/appearance won't help their mental health, and it may lead to a defeatist ""I'm fat and awful"" attitude. Instead, talk about good habits. Emphasize that people of all sizes can make good choices and take good care of their health.


Avoid equating looks to health. Some Olympic athletes are very heavy, and some thin people have bad habits.
If your child is heavy, let them look at pictures of athletes who are heavy too. This shows them that people who look like them can get fit and make healthy choices.

, You can talk to your child about weight and health while making home recipes or visiting the grocery store. Throughout these conversations, try to empower your child to make healthy food choices.Discuss food preparation with your child. For instance, you might bring them to the grocery store and talk about the different options for weekly meals.
Talk to your child about healthy recipes. Ask your child, ""How do you think we could make this recipe a little bit healthier?"" If you raise the issue in this manner, it shifts the focus from their body to a common recipe.

,, Prioritize family eating in the home. You should aim for eating fewer calories and reducing unhealthy things like salt and saturated fats. You should also aim to increase the number of fruits and vegetables in your family dinners.Feed your children fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains. Children who eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes will grow up healthier and live longer. Base your diet on plant foods as opposed to animal products.While you don't want the emphasis to be on animal products, it is still important to include lean proteins in your family's diet. Prepare lean cuts of meat (such as white-meat, skinless poultry) and choose low-fat dairy products.
Talk to your doctor or a dietitian if you need help planning a healthy diet for your child and family.

, Causes of childhood obesity include inappropriate diets with excessive saturated fats, and simply too much food. For some, there is a genetic or metabolic component behind their obesity as well. Once you have determined a new family meal plan, you will need to involve everyone in the changes.


It will be easier to make the changes when everyone is involved, including you, and when everyone understands the importance of dietary change. It can be hard to change old habits, so stick with it until the new, healthier habits feel normal.Be fair. Don't subject one child to tougher standards than another child, or they will resent you.

, Reducing childhood sugar consumption leads to major health benefits, including obesity reduction.Be mindful of juice purchases. Some juices have a lot of added sugar, which isn't a good choice.Look for 100% juice, if any.

, Encourage activity to happen as a family, or for smaller groups. For example, maybe you'd like to take your daughter out for walks after lunch every day.


Visit the local park or swimming pool.
Dance to music.
Take walks around the neighborhood.
Go for family bike rides.
Play backyard sports.

, Different children have different tastes, and your goal is not to force them into whatever exercise plan you created, but to find a type of exercise that is fun and healthy.


Extroverted children may prefer group sports, while introverted children might like one-on-one or individual activities.
Don't keep score if it stresses out your child. Some kids find it more fun to play without keeping track of who is winning.
Children, especially heavy children, may get bullied in organized sports. If your child has an awful time, they might start hating exercise altogether. Listen to your child, and take them seriously if they say they're being bullied or they want to quit.

, Children love to play, so if you can find toys that get them moving, they can have a lot of fun exercising. Consider both outdoor and indoor opportunities. If you have the financial resources, try buying things like these:


Video games like Dance Dance Revolution
Indoor trampolines
Balls for sports (kickballs, basketballs, baseballs and bats; department stores sell cheap colorful balls that work for different sports)
Scooters/skateboards (with the appropriate safety gear)
Step counters (challenge them to beat a certain number)

, You are a role model for them in life, so you should take care of your own health., Children who regularly exercise tend to perform better academically and have lower levels of stress.


Sign your children up for sports teams, if they're interested.
Sign your children up for swimming lessons.

Add a ticket pillow to the bed.,
Add a canopy top to the crib.,
Use a circus-themed mobile.,
Buy a circus crib.,
Select animal lamps.",How to Design a Circus Themed Nursery," Ideally, a circus theme should use brighter colors. Circuses are often bright, playful environments. When deigning a circus-themed nursery, opt for bright colors. Bright pinks, reds, greens, and yellows work great for a nursery color scheme.Feel free to mix and match colors as well, as circuses make use of patterns like stripes and polka dots. For example, use red and yellow polka-dotted wallpaper.;
, Murals can be a great touch for any nursery. Instead of using a solid color or wallpaper for one wall, paint a mural or hire someone to paint one. You can paint scenes from a circus such as clowns, animals doing tricks, tightrope walkers, and more.Keep furniture in mind when painting a mural. Opt to paint a mural on a wall that will not have a lot of furniture surrounding it.

, Circus themes can be somewhat chaotic. Instead of choosing a single type of pattern to dominate the room, mix and match patterns to add to the spontaneous circus atmosphere. Using patterns that are too uniform or consistent can interfere with the circus theme.For example, add a striped rug to the floor and use polka-dots for the wall paper.
You can use patterns for things like furniture. Instead of a solid colored dresser, get a dresser with vibrant patterns.

, Invest in a variety of stuffed animals in the shape of circus animals. You can have a large stuffed giraffe standing over the crib. You can place elephants, lions, and tigers on bookshelves and mantels. As your baby grows, they'll be old enough to play with the stuffed toys. In addition to having decorations, you will have toys for your baby in the future.You can try creating a scene with stuffed animals. For example, you can invest in a circular piece of styrofoam or wood at a craft store and hang it from the ceiling. Place a stuffed tiger through the circle so it looks like it's jumping through a hoop.

, Buy some paintings online or at a local art store that incorporate a circus theme. These can be paintings of circus animals, like elephants, scenes from circuses, or paintings of entertainers such as clowns. Hang these up around the nursery to give it a circus feel.Some baby stores may actually sell circus prints for nurseries. If you're shopping for things like cribs and changing tables, look through the decoration aisle for circus-themed prints.

, Take a large glass jar and purchase some clown noses. You can buy these online or at some craft stores. Fill the jar with the noses and put it on display to give off a circus feel.For an added touch, opt for a jar with a red lid to match the noses.

, Buy a pillow that's a rectangle shape and designed to look like a ticket with the words ""Admit One"" written on it. You can buy such pillows online, particularly on websites like Etsy. Place this in your baby's crib to add to the circus vibe.Make sure to check that the pillow is baby safe before adding it to the crib.

, A canopy top looks like a tent. This is a great way to make your child's nursery look like a circus. Purchase a canopy top and place it over the baby's crib.For an added circus effect, pick a canopy with a circus-like design or color. A bright, vibrant color, like a bright red, or something like stripes or polka dots will give off a circus feel.

, Mobiles come in all kinds of designs, so find one that made with a circus theme. A quick internet search for something like ""circus-themed mobile"" should yield plenty of results. Circus mobiles may have bright circus colors and include circus animals or things like clowns., Some cribs are made to look like carts used to transport animals in circuses. They have circus-like bars on the side and decorative wheels attached at the bottom. A circus crib can really emphasize the circus theme, especially when paired with a canopy top.If you don't want to purchase a circus-themed crib, simply cut out large circles and draw designs on them to look like wheels. Attach them to the bottom of the crib using glue to create the circus train effect.

, Many lamps, especially those sold at baby supply stores, are designed to look like animals. There may be a lamp with a horse as a base, for example, or a lamp where the bulb is held up by an elephant's trunk. These work great to light a circus-themed nursery."

Purchase an organic baby crib.,
Note how your crib mattress is manufactured.,
Purchase bedding with baby’s sensitive skin in mind.",How to Create an Eco Friendly Nursery1,"


Consider purchasing a crib made with recycled wood or certified natural wood to be sure your baby‘s crib is not painted with a harmful varnish. Furthermore, cribs fashioned from natural or recycled woods benefit our environment and allow the consumer to obtain a quality product.
Shop early on in your pregnancy to allow enough time for the crib to be constructed and shipped.;
, Mattresses made with artificial materials can release toxins over time. For the most part, brand new babies spend most of the hours in their day sleeping. They spend a great deal of time in the crib, so it makes sense to safeguard where they sleep.

, Bedding made from natural, organic fabrics is much gentler on baby’s newborn skin.


Consider purchasing 100% cotton bedding items or wool instead of polyester.
Look for fabrics that were made using natural dyes as well; doing so will protect your baby from harmful chemicals and allergens that can irritate baby’s skin. If you have chosen a traditional crib mattress, be sure that you use an organic mattress pad and sheet set. Organic cotton covers and sheets paired with a wool mattress topper will protect your baby from toxins, moisture and allergens.

Paint the nursery walls with eco-friendly paints that are non-toxic and environmentally friendly.,
Choose natural flooring such as cork, bamboo, natural linoleum, carpet and wood.,
Look for toys that are made from safe, nontoxic materials.",How to Create an Eco Friendly Nursery2," As consumers become more environmentally conscious and also health conscious, non-toxic paint has become more readily available.


Consider paints made without VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). These paints will have a much milder odor than traditional paints, which will make the painting process tolerable during your pregnancy.
Using non-toxic VOC-free paints greatly reduces the amount of toxins circulating through the air, which means better air quality for you and your baby.
Non-toxic paints also make for an easier clean up and can be dissolved with soap and water.

, Products such as these are durable, free of dangerous chemicals and manufactured in ways that are environmentally friendly.


Consider using natural wool carpet in your baby’s room. These carpets are free from VOCs and other toxins that may develop from stain protectors or adhesives. These are safer alternatives to traditional wall-to-wall carpeting, which not only contains these chemicals, but also holds dust and allergens.
Consider bamboo flooring. Bamboo flooring is not only a healthy choice for your baby, but for the environment as well. Unlike trees that take over 40 years to replenish, bamboo can be grown within a 5 year time frame. Traditional wood floors, while they look lovely, were probably polished or stained with finishes containing harmful chemicals. If you want to use wood, look for natural wood flooring that has been reclaimed and repurposed, which is healthier for baby and our forests.

, Buying toys that are naturally made and battery free protect not only your baby, but the environment as well. Toys made from recycled and organic materials are a great way to go green.

You’ll know when your child is ready for a toddler bed when you hear or see them climbing out of their own crib.If your crib has the option of converting into a bed – for instance, by lowering one side of the crib rails – you won’t need to invest in a separate bed. Simply follow manufacturer instructions and remove the toddler rail.If you don’t have a convertible crib, you’ll need to invest in a toddler bed. Unlike cribs, toddler beds are small and low to the ground, allowing your child to get in and out of bed on their own.
Replacing the crib with an antique bed could give your toddler room a unique look.A toddler bed is acceptable until your child is about four or five years of age. If you have other, younger children, you can keep the toddler bed and pass it on to them when your toddler outgrows it.;
, Toddler beds, like normal beds, require sheets, pillows, and blankets. You can obtain these items online or in many home and bedroom stores. Take your child with you to the home good store and allow them to select a set of sheets they like.Your child might be interested in sheets that are blue, yellow, or multicolored. Sheets with popular animated characters might also be of interest to your child. Direct your child to various sheet and comforter sets to help them make a decision that will get them excited about their room and their bedtime.Add some small stuffed animals to your child’s bed.You could give your child a personalized pillow with their name on it.Ensure your toddler bedding is made of soft, nontoxic, non-flammable material. Check the bedding’s packaging to determine if it is or is not made of appropriate materials.

, Toddlers love soft surfaces on their skin. Lay a fluffy blanket, rug, or body pillow on the floor. Your toddler can use this space to play and put puzzles together.Some toddlers like rugs that are shaped like an animal – for instance, a zebra rug or a bear rug. But these rugs might scare some toddlers. Take your toddler to the store and ask them if they would like a particular rug before making your purchase.

, There are many ways to decorate your child’s toddler room. Obtain some whimsical and kid-friendly art to amuse and stimulate your child’s mind. For instance, your child might enjoy an image of a happy monkey or similar beast. Other toddler rooms have walls covered in brightly colored abstract art.You can also paint directly onto the walls. For instance, some people like to paint trees or birds onto their walls. Some toddler rooms feature more classically-inspired murals that excite the eye.
Try hanging some family photos on the wall of your toddler room.
Avoid alphabet charts and similar decorations that are geared towards babies.In the past, many people chose pink walls if their child was a girl and blue walls if their child was a boy. However, this is no longer preferred.

, Toddlers enjoy playing games and using their imaginations. They might like doing this inside designated retreat. For instance, some toddlers have a large dollhouse, mini castle, or teepee in their rooms. This provides your toddler with a place of their own., Empty floor space is crucial to allow your child a space to play and frolic. Your toddler will surely thank you. There are several ways to add dead space when converting a nursery into a toddler room.Remove rocking chairs or ottomans you may have used to rock your baby to sleep.
Relocate the diaper pail. Swap it with a storage basket for toys and games.

Make clothes accessible to your toddler.,
Make bath items available for your toddler.,
Add plenty of bins and baskets.,
Include a desk.,
Consider a closet expansion.,
Find a new use for the changing table.,
Choose furniture that has high reuse value.",How to Convert a Nursery Into a Toddler Room2," Once your toddler can dress themselves, provide seasonally appropriate clothes in low drawers and shelves, or in the closet. This will encourage your child to develop a sense of autonomy and independence., In addition to making clothes accessible, place bath towels and robes on low shelves. Teach your toddler what materials they need during bath time and encourage them to gather these items before heading into the bathroom., Low-lying plastic bins are perfect for stashing your toddler’s toys and games.If you’re unusually orderly, you could get bins and baskets of different colors and insist that your child uses different colored bins for different purposes. For instance, you might ask your toddler to put all the blocks in the red bin, all the trains in the blue bin, and so on., Toddlers love to draw. Desks are the perfect space for kids who want to draw or doodle. The ideal desk will have a small drawer or drawers where your toddler can store paper, crayons, and/or markers., Instead of leaving clothes and toys in freestanding dressers, bins, and boxes, consider having the closet of your child’s room expanded. If possible, a closet expansion – or even a simple reorganization – can significantly increase the amount of storage space in the toddler room.If you have any of your own clothes or items in the toddler room’s closet, remove them to another location to allow your toddler to take full advantage of their closet space.

, Once your child is a toddler, they should be more-or-less potty trained. Therefore, you will have no more use for diapers. Use the many drawers and shelves in the changing table for your child’s toys, books, clothes, and games.If your changing table is too large or bulky and wouldn’t be accessible for your child, remove it and add a more appropriately-sized chest or table to the room.
Alternately, you could swap the changing table entirely and add, for instance, a plastic table and chair set to your child’s room. This will give your toddler somewhere to play.
Ensure all furniture is safely attached to the wall using the wall hooks provided to you by the manufacturer. This will prevent your toddler from pulling the furniture over onto its tiny body.

, Furniture that doesn’t seem out-of-place in contexts other than the toddler room is the best option. That way, you aren’t investing in things that only look appropriate in your toddler room. For instance, obtain a chair that is soft enough to please a toddler, but also comfortable and stylish enough to move into the living room or study.Another way to get more mileage out of your toddler room furniture is to pass it down to younger children.

Keep furniture away from windows.,
Bolt down all furniture.,
Remove choking hazards from the room.,
Keep your child away from stairs.,
Block outlets with outlet covers.",How to Convert a Nursery Into a Toddler Room3," Toddlers are like little monkeys. They love to climb. Discourage your child from climbing on furniture from a young age. Keep your child’s windows closed. Keep furniture away from windows to prevent your toddler from opening them and leaping out.Window screens will not prevent a child from falling out of a window. Unless a window has safety latches that keep it from opening more than a small amount (not enough to fall out of), you shouldn’t leave a toddler alone in a room with an open window, whether it’s screened or not.

, Be sure to bolt all the furniture to the wall to prevent it from toppling over. You should use the straps included by the manufacturer to do this, but if you’ve lost or misplaced the straps, you can buy furniture wall straps online or at your local home and bedroom store., Toddlers put almost anything they can find in their mouths. For this reason, remove small coins, toys that might get lodged in the throat, and similar objects. Anything that can fit inside a toilet paper roll does not belong in your toddler’s room.Check toys for removable or fragile parts that might break off.

, If your toddler room is on the second floor, prevent access to the stairs by using a safety gate at the top of the stairs. If your toddler room is on the ground floor and you have a basement, place a safety gate at the top of the basement stairs. Without a safety gate, your toddler might tumble down the stairs and become injured., Place outlet covers over all electrical outlets in the toddler room. It is unlikely that your toddler will get into mischief involving an outlet, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.There are many types of outlet covers. Some are a solid piece, some flip open, and some have rotating faces that swivel to allow access. Get whichever you believe is best for you and your toddler.

Choose a reputable brand.,
Check for health hazards.,
Examine how the mobile connects to the crib.,
Avoid older or secondhand mobiles.",How to Choose a Crib Mobile1," The best bet for getting a safe mobile for your baby’s room is to go with a trusted brand name. Consumer reviews of popular products may add to this assurance. You can always look up recalled products to ensure that the model or brand you have in mind has not had units recalled for safety reasons., Make sure that all safety standards for baby mobiles are met before you make a purchase. For instance, strings on a mobile should be less than seven inches long to prevent choking. Hanging objects should also be examined to ensure that they are not small or detachable.Mobiles are not safe for babies older than 5 months, or babies who are able to push themselves up onto their knees.

, If you opt for a crib mounted mobile, make sure that the connection is secure and stable, with sturdy clamps and/or heavy duty Velcro. You should be able to swing the mobile out and away from the crib when it's time for your baby to go to sleep, unless it's a musical mobile that plays lullabies to help him/her sleep.

, Old or secondhand mobiles may not meet today's safety requirements (e.g. requirement for maximum string length of seven inches) and should be avoided.Used baby items may also be frayed or worn, which can cause a safety issue.Toys hanging from an older baby mobile might be more likely to fall off or break, which could harm your child.

Decide where the mobile will be hung.,
Decide how much you want to spend.,
Read reviews online.,
Browse through stores.",How to Choose a Crib Mobile2," Before choosing a baby mobile, you must decide where exactly you will be putting it.

, The wide range of options available for baby mobiles means that the price range will be very broad as well. Before shopping, figure out how much you can spend on a mobile and resolve to stick to that limit. Look on store websites or in store flyers to compare prices, and find sales on the models that interest you.


Try using a comparison shopping website to see prices for popular mobiles across different stores and sites.

, If you are overwhelmed by the options, try looking up baby mobiles online and reading customer reviews to get a better picture of what’s available. Online shopping and research are useful alternatives for new moms who are too busy for lengthy in-store browsing.Online communities for new moms are very popular, with approximately 80% of all working moms using message boards or forums to get advice and information., If you have the time, visit different stores in your area to see what mobiles are available. Although it is time consuming, visiting in person is the best way to get an accurate representation of what the mobile looks like and how it will look in your baby’s room. You can also ask a store clerk for advice or information to help you make your choice.

Decide on your color and theme.,
Decide on movement options.,
Decide on music options.",How to Choose a Crib Mobile3," Look for bright, contrasting colors; in their first few months, babies only really distinguish bold, primary colors.Choose the type of design you want to complement your baby’s room, as well as the type of toys you want dangling from the mobile strings. Some mobiles will include removable toys that your child can play with during the day, flashing lights, a projection nightlight, or other fun options to keep your baby happy., Baby mobiles are generally either wind operated or battery operated. Wind operated models are losing favor as they require air movement within the baby’s room.Mechanically operated mobiles, which run on a small motor, are simple to use and can offer a wide range of movements (e.g. up and down, clockwise and counter-clockwise).Some electronic mobiles are also remote operable.

, Many mobiles feature a music box that plays to help your baby calm down or sleep. The duration of play length varies between models, as does the volume of the music; sound should be soft and not loud enough to risk damage to your baby’s hearing.There are two types of musical mobile options:


Wind up music mobiles, where you must manually turn a key or handle to play music for a short period of time.
Battery operated music mobiles, where music plays at the push of a button; there are often multiple melodies to choose from.

Test for celiac disease.",How to Know if Your Child Is Allergic to Gluten," If your child has relatives with allergies, your child is more likely to develop an allergy. If both your child's biological parents have food or pollen allergies, chances are especially high.Age is another factor. Your child is more likely to develop a wheat allergy when she is an infant or toddler.;
, If your child is allergic to wheat, he could exhibit symptoms of allergic reaction during a meal, or up to two hours after. Serious symptoms such as anaphylaxis are most likely to appear within a few minutes of your child eating an allergen, but can appear hours later., Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that can interfere with your child's breathing. Symptoms include sudden wheezing, swelling of the tongue and throat, a warm temperature, rash, vomiting, and a weak and rapid pulse. If your child experiences anaphylaxis, take her to the emergency room or call an ambulance.Call 911 for an ambulance if your child is turning blue, having difficulty breathing, or if you live more than five to 10 minutes from a hospital or ER.
If your child seems to be recovering from the worst of the anaphylactic reaction, take her to the emergency room anyway. There could be a second wave of worse symptoms.If you think your child may have experienced anaphylaxis previously, get her tested for a wheat allergy or other allergens to prevent future occurrences.

, If your child grows hoarse, wheezes, or has any difficulty breathing, he might be having an allergic respiratory response. If your child complains of swelling in his throat or mouth, that could point to an allergy. Other milder respiratory symptoms include a stuffy or runny nose, or sneezing.


Serious trouble breathing can be a sign of anaphylaxis. Immediately take your child to the emergency room or call an ambulance. If your child cannot breathe or has a blue tint to his skin, dial 911 for an ambulance immediately., A child who is allergic to wheat might develop hives, red spots, or a rash after ingesting gluten. Check your child's body for clusters of welts, or hives, of varying sizes. Check for eczema: dry patches or blisters that resemble pimples.Any rash that develops after eating could be an indication that your child has a wheat gluten allergy.


Also look for swelling of the eyes, lips, or tongue.
Try to prevent your child from scratching. The rashes will worsen if further irritated.
Rashes and blisters can also be a sign of possible celiac disease., A child who is allergic to gluten might have invisible reactions, such as a stomachache after eating gluten. If your child is scratching, she might have itching and burning skin that does not develop a rash. If your child is too young to explain her symptoms, pay attention to unusual crying or fussing after a meal. Vomiting and diarrhea can also be signs., You might notice that your child has trouble with some gluten and not others. Ask for a wheat allergy test if your child reacts poorly to wheat but is able to eat rye, barley, or other glutinous grains. Roughly a fifth of people with a wheat allergy are also allergic to other grains., Wheat can be found in products such as Play-doh and bath products. If your child is showing signs of allergic reactions between meals, check the content of the objects he is handling.If those objects contain wheat, get your child tested for a wheat allergy.

, Wheat allergies are common in young children. Most children with a wheat allergy outgrow it before age five.This does not mean you should wait for your child to outgrow it without a diagnosis! Children with wheat allergies are in danger of anaphylaxis, and need to be near medication at all times., An allergist is a physician who specializes in allergy detection and management. You may need a referral to visit an allergist. Call your insurance and ask, then make the appointment.If you need a referral, make an appointment with your child's doctor first.

, In the days or weeks before the appointment, feed your child an ordinary diet, and record his reactions throughout the day if possible. However, don't give your child foods that you know cause allergic symptoms. You don't want to trigger a serious allergic reaction. If possible, try not eliminate gluten from your child's diet before testing them for a wheat allergy. Doing so could interfere with the diagnosis.Your doctor might test your child for celiac disease at the same time. Follow the same steps for a celiac disease test., Before your child's appointment, gather information about any diagnosed allergies, sensitivities, and instances of celiac disease or gluten sensitivity among your child's relatives. In the weeks or days before the appointment, take note of what your child eats, and any symptoms of discomfort or irritation she exhibits. Bring a list of any medicines, supplements, or vitamins your child is taking., Your child will probably be given the skin test, during which the skin is pricked with a needle containing a drop of purified wheat protein. If your child develops an itchy red bump after 15 minutes, he may be diagnosed with a wheat allergy.If your child has a pre-existing skin condition, or takes a medication that could interfere with the skin test, a blood test will be ordered.Have your child tested for a wheat allergy, especially if you suspect he has experienced anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can endanger your child's life.If your child is found to be allergic to wheat, your doctor will talk to you about how to avoid wheat and if any other treatments are needed. You may be given an injectable epinephrine pen to use in an emergency.

, If your child is exhibiting sensitivity to wheat, you may want to get her tested for celiac disease as well. Your child will be given a blood test to start. If the tests detect antibodies prevalent in the blood of those with celiac disease, your child will be given an endoscopy or capsule endoscopy. The doctor will examine images of the small intestine for signs of celiac disease, and collect a small tissue sample for analysis.It is urgent that your child be tested if you suspect they have celiac disease. Children do not ""grow out"" of celiac disease. It is a lifelong condition, and leaving it untreated could lead to malnutrition, loss of bone density, or reproductive issues including infertility. People with untreated celiac have a higher chance of contracting certain kinds of cancer, such as intestinal lymphoma or small bowel cancer.

, After testing, the doctor may ask you to gradually or immediately eliminate wheat or all gluten-containing products from your child's diet. This is one way to check for wheat allergy.


Keep a food diary for your child. You may have already been keeping track of what your child eats, but your doctor may ask you to continue to do so after testing for celiac disease and wheat allergy. This may be a key part of your child's elimination diet.

, Celiac disease can appear at any time in a person's life, and can affect anyone. Children who have relatives with celiac disease have a higher likelihood of having it themselves. Celiac disease is also likely to appear in children who have type 1 diabetes (juvenile diabetes), Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune thyroid disease, or microscopic colitis.


Other risk factors include early childhood infections. If your child had any sort of infection in the first months of his life and symptoms suspicious for celiac disease, it may be worth talking to your doctor about testing for celiac disease.If your child has any close relatives with celiac disease, talk to your doctor about having him tested even if he shows no symptoms. Asymptomatic celiac disease can harm your child if untreated., Many of the symptoms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, otherwise known as gluten intolerance, mimic those of celiac disease. Unlike celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity is not an autoimmune disorder. Temporarily untreated non-celiac gluten sensitivity will cause your child discomfort, but will not damage the small intestine or cause other permanent problems.Symptoms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity sometimes occur hours or days after the consumption of gluten. This can be a sign that your child has gluten intolerance rather than celiacs disease.The only treatment for gluten insensitivity is to follow a gluten-free diet.

, Celiac disease and gluten sensitivity can cause many symptoms similar to wheat allergy symptoms, including blistering rashes. However, children suffering from celiac disease may exhibit distinct symptoms, such as stunted growth, neurological disorders, and cavities. Children with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity might complain of joint pain, and seem to be constantly tired and confused.If your child shows any of these symptoms, she might have celiac disease or gluten intolerance rather than a wheat gluten allergy.

, Children who exhibit signs of gluten allergy or sensitivity should be tested for celiac disease. Untreated celiac disease can stunt a child's growth, damage the small intestine, and increase the risk of certain cancers.Do not eliminate gluten from your child's diet before you have him tested for celiac disease and wheat allergy, as this could interfere with the diagnosis."

Consult a pediatrician.,
Introduce new foods.,
Consider the nutritional value of foods.,
Avoid processed foods.,
Explore new recipes.,
Respect the wishes of your children.",How to Raise Vegetarian Children,"


Before you alter your child's diet in any way, consult with their pediatrician. Your pediatrician can give you specific information such as how many calories they should consume on a daily basis as well as which foods may be best at various ages.;
,


Even vegetarian children can be notoriously picky eaters. In order to ensure that they consume a well balanced diet you'll need to slowly introduce new foods into their meals. These foods don't need to be exotic, but they do need to be healthy.

,


Vegetarian children need protein in their diet but the most common protein sources are from animal products. Investigate vegetarian foods such as quinoa, legumes, tofu and other products that are high in protein and incorporate these into their diet. Ensure that each meal is nutritionally well balanced.

,


It is just as easy to eat poorly on a vegetarian diet as it is on a regular diet. Supermarkets offer plenty of processed vegetarian options from substitute bacon to meatless hamburgers. These products are often filled with chemicals, fillers and empty calories. Teach your children to make wise choices with you at the grocery store.

,


Get the kids involved with you in the kitchen as you explore new vegetarian recipes. There's no reason to buy the ultra-processed vegetarian hamburger patties when there are myriad black bean or grain patty recipes available. Encouraging the children to help you cook will only foster their interest in staying on a vegetarian diet.

,


There may come a time in the life of your children when they express a desire to explore a traditional diet including animal products. If this happens explain to them your reason behind being vegetarians but respect their decision to experiment. If you forbid them foods then they may become sneaky and begin lying about their food choices.

Know how much Vitamin D your children should be getting.,
Eat foods rich in Vitamin D.


See a Vitamin D Rich Foods List for exact amounts of Vitamin D in certain foods.,
Encourage outside play time.,
Take vitamin supplements.",How to Make Sure Your Children Get Enough Vitamin D," Infants, children, and teenagers should be getting about 400 IU of vitamin D every day. That's equivalent to 10 μg.;
,
Many fatty fish, such as tuna, salmon, and sardines, are rich in vitamin D.
Drink fortified milk and orange juice, and eat cereals with vitamin D supplements.
Use fortified milk instead of water in soups and oatmeal.
Feed children yogurt fortified with Vitamin D.
A teaspoon of cod liver oil has about 400 IU of Vitamin D, the recommended level for children.

, Vitamin D is a conditional vitamin, which means that it is necessary to eat only when your body does not make enough of it by itself. Your body makes it in your skin through the action of UV rays from the sun. It only takes about 15- 20 minutes in the sun for your body to make enough. However, putting on sunscreen blocks the UV-B rays that help make Vitamin D, so slathering on sunscreen every time you go outside will not help you make more Vitamin D.


Unless you burn easily, don't put on sunscreen as soon as you go outside. Instead, wait for about 10 minutes.
People with darker skin coloring have a harder time getting enough Vitamin D naturally - that is, through exposure to the sun- because darker skin blocks UV rays.

, Children lacking in Vitamin D can make up for it with multivitamin tablets. Make sure to purchase ones that write ""Calcium + Vitamin D"" for added minerals.

Note if she appears underweight, with protruding bones and a sunken appearance.,
Check if she seems tired, weak, or experiences fainting spells.,
Notice if her nails appear brittle and her hair breaks easily or starts to fall out.,
Ask her if she has menstrual irregularities or does not get her period.,
Notice if she refuses to eat or maintains a very restrictive diet.,
Be aware of any rituals she develops around eating.,
Check if she is exercising excessively or has an extreme workout routine.,
Note if she complains about her weight or puts down her appearance.,
Ask her if she is taking diet pills or weight loss supplements.,
Notice if she withdraws from friends, family, and social situations.",How to Recognize Signs of Anorexia in Young Girls," One of the major symptoms of extreme weight loss is having protruding bones, especially the collarbones and the chest bones. This is due to the lack of body fat on her body, leading to bone definition under the skin.Her face may also appear sunken, with protruding cheekbones, and she may look overly pale or undernourished.;
, Eating too little over a period of time can lead to signs of fatigue like dizziness, fainting spells, and an inability to do any physical activity. Someone with anorexia may also struggle to get out of bed or to complete day to day tasks due to extremely low energy from not eating properly or not eating at all., Due to a lack of nutrients, her nails may break easily or appear brittle. As well, her hair may fall out in clumps or break off easily in large chunks.Another known symptom of anorexia is the development of fine downy hair on the face and body, a condition known as lanugo. This is due to the body’s attempts to stay warm, despite a lack of nutrients and energy through eating and food., Many young women who suffer from anorexia fail to get their period or have irregular menstrual cycles. In 14-16 year old girls, this condition is known as amenorrhoea or absent periods.If a young girl develops amenorrhoea due to an eating disorder, such as anorexia, she is at risk of other health issues and should see a doctor as soon as possible.

, Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder where the sufferer refuses to eat in an attempt to achieve a certain body weight. If a person is struggling with anorexia, she will often refuse to eat or come up with excuses about why she cannot eat. She may also skip meals or pretend she has eaten when in fact she has not. Though she may appear hungry, she may deny her hunger and refuse to eat.As well, she may create a very restrictive diet for themselves, whether it is counting calories so she eats significantly less calories than her body requires or only eating low fat foods that she thinks will not lead to weight gain. These are considered “safe” foods, and may be used as an excuse to show she is eating when in fact she is eating a lot less than she should be to maintain a healthy diet., Many young girls who suffer from anorexia will develop food rituals to maintain control when they eat. She may push food around on her plate to make it look like she ate or she may pick at their food but not actually eat any of the food on the plate. She may also cut her food into small pieces or chew food and then spit it out.She may also have a food ritual where she throws up after eating. Note if she goes to the bathroom after every meal and has issues with tooth decay or bad breath, which are both caused by the acid in vomit.

, This is likely due to a desire to maintain control over her weight and to feel she can maintain her weight loss. Many sufferers of anorexia will have an extreme focus on their exercise regime and may workout daily or multiple times a day in an effort to maintain their weight.You should also note if she is ramping up her workouts, but her appetite has not increased or she is still not eating at all. This may be a sign her anorexia is getting worse and she is trying to maintain control over her exercise regime as a way to control her weight.

, Anorexia is also a disorder that appears on a psychological level, where the sufferer constantly complains about her weight or puts down her appearance. She may do this casually while looking in the mirror, or she may struggle with her appearance when you go shopping together or go out in public. She may also talk about how overweight or unattractive she appears and how she desires a thinner body, even when she appears thin.She may also practice “body checking”, where she repeatedly weighs herself, measures her waist size, and checks her body in the mirror. As well, many sufferers of anorexia will wear baggy clothing to hide their bodies or to avoid noticing their weight.

, In an effort to lose weight, she may take diet pills or weight loss supplements to speed up the process. Using these substances are a big part of trying to control weight gain and weight loss.She may also take laxatives or diuretics, which is medication that helps to remove fluid from the body. In fact, these medications all have little effect on the calories she absorbs in food and will not affect her weight.

, Often, anorexia goes hand in hand with depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, especially in young girls. A person with anorexia may isolate herself from friends and family, and avoid social situations or activities. She may refuse to participate in activities she used to enjoy or withdraw from being around friends or family she used to get excited about hanging out with.Her anorexia may start to affect her performance in school, her ability to socialize with her peers, and her ability to complete tasks at her job or at home. These shifts in behavior could be signs that she may be struggling with anorexia and needs your support and help in order to seek treatment for this illness.

,
For growing children milk is a key ingredient, the source of calcium and protein.,
Based on these observations from chart , now the task will be to change the diet routine accordingly by making a new chart.,Make sure the new chart includes at least one fruit a day

,
Breakfast, lunch and dinner is not repeated with same food.,
You are not feeding more of fried items to the kids .Make them get used to taste of fresh foods..in long run their taste will be inclined towards fresh foods rather than unhealthy foods.

Try non-dairy varieties of milk.,
Use other forms of dairy.,
Serve vegetables that are high in calcium and vitamin D. Milk’s nutrients are also present in broccoli, spinach, sweet potatoes, and bok choy.,
Set a good example.",How to Help Your Child Enjoy Milk2," Soy, almond, coconut, and rice milk are fortified with certain nutrients to make the benefits comparable to milk.

Don’t serve your child regular milk if they are lactose intolerant.,
Don’t serve your child milk if they have a dairy allergy.,
Don’t introduce cow’s milk to your child’s diet before they turn one.",How to Help Your Child Enjoy Milk3," Lactose is a sugar found in dairy that some people cannot digest. Lactose intolerance generally causes digestive problems such as bloating, cramps, and diarrhea. Lactose is not present in soy, almond, coconut, and rice milk. Most grocery stores also sell lactose-free cow’s milk.Lactose intolerance is most common among people of Asian, African, or Native American heritage, but can happen to anyone.Lactose intolerance usually develops during the teen or adult years, but it can present in children as young as two.
While it is very rare for babies to be born lactose intolerant, some babies born prematurely may show temporary signs of lactose intolerance., Parents often conflate lactose intolerance with being allergic to dairy, but the two are very different. While dairy allergies can also cause digestive problems, other reactions include wheezing, vomiting, and hives. In extreme cases, dairy allergies can be fatal. Dairy allergies are more common among very young children. These allergies are often temporary.
It is possible for children with no allergy to cow’s milk to suffer from an allergy to sheep’s milk.If your child is allergic to cow’s milk, they are more likely to be allergic to goat’s milk., Cow’s milk is the most popular form of milk, but even lactose tolerant babies younger than one won’t digest it well.

Choose kid-sized foods.,
Make snacks dippable.,
Try sweeter foods.,
Choose softer foods.,
Avoid foods that may be a choking hazard.,
Watch for allergies.",How to Serve Healthy and Appealing Toddler Snacks1," When you're looking for nutritious foods to feed your toddler, you need to make sure you pick appropriate foods. Choosing items that are small in size or that are ""toddler-sized"" will be helpful.


Toddlers need to have smaller sized foods. Their hands, fingers, mouth and teeth are smaller than adults'. Cutting up foods or purchasing foods that are smaller in size make it easier for your toddler to hold and eat them.
The appropriate size of foods will depend on the age of your toddler. Very small items (like halved grapes) are needed for toddlers around the age of one and two. As they get older, it's safe to allow them to have slightly larger items (like whole grapes).
Try items like: grapes (cut in half), dry cereal, whole grain crackers, hard boiled eggs, pitted cherries or sugar snap peas.
You can also make foods toddler-sized. Cutting up or chopping foods into bite sized pieces also works.;
, Another great way to get toddlers to enjoy more nutritious foods is by allowing them to dip. Consider serving nutritious foods with a fun dip for your toddler.


Toddlers get an enjoyment at having some control over how they eat their foods. If you provide them a little bowl of sauce, they get to decide how much dip to have with their foods.Serving foods with a dip is also a great way to get your toddler to try new foods or ones they previously didn't like. For example, if they didn't like carrots before, try serving it with hummus.
Ideas include: fruit with a yogurt dip, whole grain pita chips with hummus, sugar snap peas and ranch dip.

, Part of the reason toddlers are such picky eaters is that they have more sensitive tastes. Be mindful of this and choose foods that are naturally more sweet.


Toddlers frequently have no issues with fruit. That's because fruits naturally sweet and more palatable to toddlers.
Vegetables can be a little bit bitter which can turn toddlers off. Stick to naturally sweet vegetables to help them expand their tastes.
Sweeter veggies to try include: sugar snap peas, corn, sweet peppers, beets, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, pumpkin and carrots.

, Another thing to consider when serving toddler-friendly food is the texture. If foods are too hard, it may not be a food your toddler can eat well.


Your toddler may seem to not like certain foods, when in fact they're just having some difficulty chewing or eating them.Foods that are too hard to bite through or too difficult to chew won't be appealing to your toddler.
Make sure foods are soft enough for your toddler. You may need to cook things or cut them in very small pieces in order for your toddler to enjoy.
For example, you could blanch raw vegetables. They're usually very hard and crunchy, but once blanched are slightly softer and easier to chew.

, “Slippery foods” (whole grapes, large pieces of meat or chicken, hot dogs, candy); small, hard foods (nuts, seeds, popcorn, chips, pretzels, raw carrots, raisins); and sticky foods (peanut butter, marshmallows) can all pose a choking hazard.You may want to avoid these foods entirely until your toddler is older, or you may just need to be extra careful with these foods, making sure you cut them to the appropriate size for a toddler.

, The most common food allergies are milk, eggs, peanuts and other nuts, soybeans, wheat, fish, and shellfish. Most kids outgrow their food allergies, but it is important to identify them to avoid serious reactions. If your child experiences any of the following after eating, they may be having an allergic reaction: hives; swelling; itching lips, tongue, or mouth; abdominal pain; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; wheezing; shortness of breath; or lightheadedness.Some children may have a serious, possibly life-threatening allergic reaction to foods known as anaphylaxis. If they experience swelling of the airway, serious difficulty with breathing, a drop in blood pressure, or two or more of the above symptoms simultaneously, call emergency services immediately.

Melt 1/2 cup of semisweet chocolate chips in a microwave in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, heat up about 1/2 cup of peanut or almond butter. Stir each until they're slightly fluid.
Dip a spoon into each the chocolate and peanut butter. Have your toddler drizzle the chocolate and peanut butter over the apple and pear slices.
Then, have them sprinkle on 1/2 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut and a dusting of cinnamon. Serve immediately.

, Although traditional sushi is not a toddler-friendly food (young children should never eat raw or under-cooked fish), you can make a look-alike version of this finger food at home using toddler-friendly foods. They'll be excited to enjoy this unique food.Start by laying out a 12"" whole wheat tortilla. Spread on 2 tablespoons of garden vegetable cream cheese in an even layer.
Then layer out two to three slices of turkey or ham deli meat and one to two slices of their favorite cheese. On top of the cheese, arrange a single layer of baby spinach leaves.
Roll the tortilla up like a jelly roll or a sushi roll. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerator for 30 – 60 minutes.
Take the ""sushi"" out of the refrigerator and slice in 2"" rounds. Serve immediately.

Lead by example.,
Let your child pick out nutritious foods.,
Get your child involved in cooking.,
Be patient.",How to Serve Healthy and Appealing Toddler Snacks3," If you want your toddler to eat more nutritious foods, the first thing you need to do is lead by example. If you're not eating well, your toddler may not either.You may be surprised how much your toddler is learning from you. But at this age, they're mimicking their parents behaviors a lot.
Toddlers are watching what you eat, how you eat and how you're talking about different foods.
Talk positively about healthy foods and let them see you having healthy and nutritious foods at meals and snacks.

, One great way to get your child interested in healthier foods is by letting them help choose their foods. Consider bringing your child along to the grocery store with you. Let them get involved in picking some of the foods they will eat.Talk about healthy foods and finding foods to have as snacks. Stroll through the produce section and ask what they would like to have as a snack.
For example, as you're passing by the fruit, mention how much your toddler loves fruit and how it'd be a great snack. Then ask them to pick something out to eat that week or day.
Also, try to stay out of ""trouble aisles."" If your child loves chips or cookies, stay away from the aisles that have them. If they're not looking at it or see it, they may not ask for it.

, In addition to letting your toddler participate in the shopping, let them get involved in some food preparation.


Studies have shown that if you allow your kids to get involved in the cooking or preparation of meals or snacks, they're more likely to eat them.When it's time for a snack or your toddler mentions they're hungry, ask them if they'd like to help you make their snack.
Make sure to choose tasks that are toddler-friendly. They can stir, roll out or help measure different foods.

, With all things, it pays to be patient with your toddler. They may not like a certain food initially or be reluctant to try it. But be patient and take your time as they grow and expand their palates.

Studies have shown that it can take a toddler 15 – 30 tries of a food item before they begin to learn to like it.This is especially true with some vegetables and whole grains that have a slightly bitter or unique flavor or texture.
They key to getting your child to eat healthy snacks, is to keep presenting healthy foods over and over again. In time, they will become used to and accustomed to these foods.

Give your child options to choose from.,
Understand that ""newness"" is a large part of the problem.,
Don’t try to control everything and don't force it.,
Ask for your child’s help when food shopping.,
Show them how food is made.,
Invite an adventurous friend over for dinner.,
Watch your own eating behavior.,
Eat your meals with your children.,
Enjoy food as a family.",How to Help Your Child Overcome Picky Eating," Rather than trying to make your child like one type of food, introduce a range of different food types. If you provide your child with a variety of foods to choose from, this will increase the chances that your child will eat and learn to like something and thus get the nutrition they need.For example, don’t force your child to eat just a salad if they are in a stage of avoiding vegetables. Instead give them a small salad along with other options like cheese, meat, and/or fruits.
Try giving the new food alongside one of the child's favorite foods. For instance, ask your child to try a small slice of apple, and give them a handful of a food they like once they consume the new food.;
, A child that feels involved in choosing their food will be more motivated to eat the food. For example, ask your child about what they want in their sandwich and which piece of fruit they'd like for lunch, offering them a finite set of options that you have deemed acceptable. The key here is to make options available, but not to force your child into one particular thing. If they try something and don’t like it, don’t force them to eat it.
Keep making a variety of foods available to your child even if they say they don’t like certain ones. Offer the food again and again (an unlimited number of times., Everything is new to a toddler. Children may have to try a food many times (sometimes 10 to 15 times) before they finally accept the new taste. Be patient and keep trying.


Try linking new foods with old foods that your child already likes by telling them what the two foods have in common. For example if your child likes blueberries they may also like strawberries, since both are fruits of a similar type.

, Most children don’t respond well to negative food reinforcement. If you try to force them to eat something they don’t want to or make eating seem like a chore instead of something enjoyable, they will be more likely to continue with their picky eating habits.Introduce the new food in small portions so that the child does not feel overwhelmed. You may start out with a single pea, for instance. Over time, slowly increase the amount of the new food you put on your child's plate.
Try gentle encouragement and leaving the choice ultimately up to your child. You don’t want to associate negative feelings with food in your child’s mind.

, When you go grocery shopping, ask your child to help you pick out certain foods — especially new food items that you will want them to try. Let your child feel the texture of the food and pick out “just the right one.” When they are more involved they are also more likely to participate in eating the food.Give your child the opportunity to pick out something on their own that you then incorporate into a meal. This may help them overcome their pickiness by feeling more connected to the preparation process.

, Sharing how the food is made and where the food comes from with your child may make them more open to trying it. If possible, cook meals at home (from scratch) to teach children about food preparation. Let your child participate in preparing dinner for the family. Seeing what goes into the food they eat may help them get over their pickiness.
You can even try to let them help out in the kitchen — while you are cooking or when you want help setting the table.
Make food preparation fun. For example, use cookie cutters to cut foods into various shapes.

, Kids are extremely susceptible to influence from friends. If your child is a notoriously picky eater, invite a more adventurous friend over for dinner. Hopefully your child will see their friend eating all the things they refuse to eat and follow their friend’s lead., How you eat and the way you talk about food inevitably influences your child's feelings about food. Be very careful about ""diet"" talk and expressing strong preferences for certain foods in your own eating regimen. Children will pick up on the messages you give, even subtle ones.Avoid eating too many unhealthy foods, especially in front of your child.
Avoid negative talk about foods that you don’t like so you don’t unnecessarily encourage your child’s pickiness.

, As tempting as it might be to leave children to it to get on with more cooking or the household chores, young children will be more likely to get distracted and stop eating if nobody is paying attention. Stay with them to help encourage eating.


Engage with your children at dinner time and show them that you care. Ask them things about their day and talk to them about your day.

, Take time to enjoy the act of eating and spending quality time together as a family as well as the taste of different foods. This will help make it a positive experience for your child. The child will pick up on positive energy at the table. Always eat at the dinner table together.Try to consistently make time for dinner as a family. This will make them associate enjoyable family time with eating and may lead to less pickiness.
Minimize distractions such as by turning off the television and putting away phones.
Even if your child is not eating the food, encourage them to remain at the table during meals."

Manage your expectations.",How to Get Your Kids to Eat Food That They Don't Like," When you’re cooking, don’t necessarily make meals geared towards your kids. However, consider their tastes in addition to yours when planning and cooking meals.Make a couple of offerings you know your kids will like if you’re trying a new recipe.For example, if you’re making meatloaf for the first time, consider having sides you know your kids will eat such as potatoes, pasta, or cut veggies.
Remember that you’re not a short order cook, but you can tailor dishes you are already making. For example, if you’re putting a spicier topping on your meatloaf, consider leaving part of it plain for the kids. Allow them to try the spicy part if they like.;
, Children are often slow to accept new tastes and textures in food.Encourage your child to try the foods by continuing to place a small portion on their plate. You may find that she eventually tries—and likes—the food.Avoid forcing your child to eat the food. Simply putting it on the plate and letting her see you and others enjoy the food may be enough to get her to try it without coercion.This is called positive peer pressure., Vegetables, certain cheeses, or spices are often foods that kids don’t like.Mixing foods that kids don’t like with dishes they do like can not only get them to eat the food, but also like it.Keep the mixing simple. For example, if your kids don’t like peas, add them to some rice with a little sauce. For zucchini, you could replace a few lasagna noodles with zucchini strips.Reveal what’s in the dish only when your child says how much she likes it. Remember to stay positive. For example, “I’m so glad you like the lasagna! And you know what else, it has zucchini it in with the noodles. They give it a little extra special taste.”
Remind your child that she’s tried the dish before and liked it.

, Many experts agree that negotiating or bribing your child to eat foods she doesn’t like just doesn’t work.If there is a food she “thinks” she doesn’t like, ask her to try one bite of it without forcing her.Allow your child to try or leave the food on the plate and don’t force her.She may end up trying the food once she sees other people eating it.Avoid negotiating with your child.Saying things like “a little bit for Dad” or “one more bite for Mom” are not normal eating behaviors.Try avoiding bribery as well. There is no unanimous consensus on bribing your child to eat with promises of food they like, but most experts agree that it is not an advisable practice., Many children play before dinnertime and generate a healthy hunger during this time. If you’re serving a food, such as a vegetable side dish, that your child doesn’t like, consider putting it on the table before anything else. Her hunger may get the better of her aversion.Tell your child you’re getting the main dish ready and it’s going to be a few minutes. Point out that there is something already on the table and that she can start with that.
Remember not to force your child to eat food, which is often ineffective and counterproductive.If she’s hungry enough, she’ll likely eat it., Get your kids involved with meal preparation. This gives them the chance to see and feel the ingredients and different foods, including ones they may not like. It may also make them want to try the dish they helped make, even if it contains something they think they don’t like.


Allow your child to take active part in cooking through chopping, stirring, bringing plated food to the table, or setting the table.
Make sure to praise your child at dinner for her help. For example, “Sophie, you did such a great job cooking tonight. Everyone, doesn’t this taste amazing?”

, Studies have shown that children eat a more nutritious diet when they have regular family meals.As often as possible, set a place for every family member, including your child, at the dinner table and eat as a family unit.Eat together even if everyone isn’t home. Make sure to explain this to your child. For example, “Mom had a meeting tonight and wanted to be here with us, especially since we’re having this awesome lasagna.”Create positive peer pressure during the meal. If your child sees others eating and enjoying food she doesn’t like, she may be more inclined to try those foods.Model good behavior for your child by eating and enjoying the same healthy foods that you want your child to eat., The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that parents focus on the child's whole eating pattern rather than on pinpointing specific things for the child to avoid.You can help ensure your child is getting what she needs by:


Selecting nutritious foods from the five food groups: vegetables, fruits, grains, low-fat dairy, and quality protein sources like lean meats and eggs.
Giving children a variety of food experiences.
Staying away from highly processed foods.
Using small amounts of sugar, salt, and fats with high nutrition choices to enhance the child’s enjoyment of the food., People often overestimate how much food they need and this is no different with what they give their children.Offering your child only as much food as she can eat may help her consume choices she doesn’t like.Check the suggested portion size for your child’s age before serving food.For example, there is a big difference between what a 1 year old should get and what her 5 year old brother or sister should eat. A one year old can have ¼ cup cooked vegetables, where a 5 year old can have a ¼ cooked vegetables with ½ cup salad.Keep the portions on the smaller size, which may be less overwhelming for your child.Smaller portions also discourage overeating, though you can always give your child more food if she is hungry.Be aware that many children don’t eat enough at mealtimes to keep themselves full. Aim to give your child three meals and two snacks every day.Make sure the snacks are high quality nutrition such as string cheese, yogurt cups, apple slices, a piece of lean turkey, or whole grain crackers with peanut butter.Space out mealtimes and snacks as evenly as possible. Offer snacks well in advance of meals. This can ensure that your child eats a full meal., Recent research has shown that children have different taste palates than adults, in many cases preferring sweet foods to savory or salty options.Keep in mind that children’s tastes are different than an adult's tastes. Their tastes may change as they age. You might find it easier to prepare meals for your child is you are aware of their food aversions.Be aware that a child’s love of sugar may come from the fact that sugar can be a natural pain reliever in children, as recent research has shown.This doesn’t mean, however, that you should indulge all of your child’s sugar cravings.Realize that your child’s taste may change overnight.Consider avoiding very spicy foods and snacks. Many children may find the flavor too much to handle, but recent studies have also shown they can cause inflammation to the stomach lining as well as abdominal pain.Be aware that recent studies show that children have larger reactions to unpleasant smelling foods like pungent cheeses.Allow them to feel out if they want to try “smelly” foods.

, Children often thrive with routines, and having regular mealtimes with the same seating arrangement may help your child be more adventurous with food.Make sure to engage everyone at the table, including your child, in conversation to keep things fun and interesting.Ask your child what her favorite part of the meal is and what she learned at school that day.
Keep the tone of your conversations pleasant. This can help your child look forward to mealtimes and may make her more receptive to new foods.Give your child a chance to settle down before eating if she’s playing. Tell your child ten to fifteen minutes before dinner starts so she can get herself ready., Fussy eating is often not a child’s problem, but one of the parent.Keeping your own expectations for your child’s eating habits in check—while making sure she’s getting proper nutrition—may help prevent battles over food.Remember that children often won’t like the idea of something new on their plate.Keep reintroducing the food until the child is used to it.
Let your child be a child and remember that change can be difficult for them.Leave your child alone and don’t force her to eat.Studies have shown that forcing a child to eat is counterproductive.Be aware that your child won’t starve if she doesn’t eat. In fact, she is more likely to learn to be more flexible in her choices than she is to go hungry.Avoid enforcing unrealistic manners. For example, a spoon is often easier for a child to handle than a fork."

Choose sweeter vegetables.,
Choose non-leafy vegetables.,
Introduce bitter vegetables slowly.",How to Make Vegetables More Appealing to Kids1," Vegetables like carrots, peas and sweet potatoes offer a sweeter flavor than many of the vegetables children sometimes refuse to touch (like broccoli and brussels sprouts). As children are genetically driven to eat sweeter foods, it makes sense to start with the sweetest vegetables. You can even make them sweeter by adding a honey glaze for carrots, or maple syrup and brown sugar for sweet potatoes., Children are also genetically driven to avoid the veggies that look the most like leafy plants. Cutting, dicing, and blending can help disguise the leafiness, but starting with butternut squash or sweet peas may help get the ball rolling., Many people have a higher sensitivity to bitterness than others. This is especially true in children, and this sensitivity tends to decrease with age. So, by starting kids with kid-friendly vegetables, and slowly introducing the more difficult ones can get the child interested (especially if you make it a point to show them your enjoyment of the vegetables)."
"
Don’t mix a ton of vegetables together in a single dish.,
Use only completely disguised/blended veggies in soft or liquid dishes.,
Add veggies with unusual textures slowly.,
Add a simple flavor enhancer that kids love.",How to Make Vegetables More Appealing to Kids2," Starting simply by having no more than one or two veggies in a single dish will make the veggies more appealing. Slowly introduce dishes that are more complex. For instance, if you know that your child likes broccoli, you can mix it with a smooth pasta sauce and pasta to make a more balanced meal. Don't try adding roasted peppers if you know your child doesn't like it. The sauce may not completely cover the taste or texture., While disguising vegetables can be a real solution, be careful not to hide crunchy, flavorful vegetables that a kid professes a dislike to in a soft dish like stuffing. While they may be perfectly willing to eat the stuffing, for instance, chomping down on an onion may make them pause before eating the dish again. The same thing goes with sauces and salsa. Any professed dislike for a vegetable due to texture that is not properly blended will likely cause a similar reaction to eating the vegetable alone., Kids are more sensitive to textures in foods than adults. Whether it’s sliminess or a “wet-crunch,”kids (and adults) can be sensitive to food textures. Going with soft, but not slimy, or pleasantly crisp vegetables (like carrots), can make eating vegetables fun for kids., Adding lemon juice or cheese to broccoli can help make the veggies more appealing.Honey or maple syrup can make cooked carrots more appetizing. In any case, they will be more likely to try veggies topped with flavors they love.Dips can be a great way to get kids to eat fresh crunchy veggies such as carrots or celery. Ranch dressing works especially well. Plain hummus can also make a great dip that is both kid-friendly and nutritious.
Peanut butter is also useful in getting kids to eat more veggies. Carrots and peanut butter can be a tasty treat.

If your recipe is too-carb heavy, this might need to be an occasional, rather than regular, snack. However, sweet potato bread is a great way for kids to get a lot of needed nutrients., With the right proportions, you can use this to include some of the trickier vegetables in your kids’ diets. Spinach and kale are pretty easy to include. It’s important to have enough sweet fruits or honey to balance the bitterness of the greens. However, it will be harder to mask veggies with strong flavors such as onions and garlic., A lot of kids struggle with texture as well as flavor. By blending veggies that kids normally don’t like because of texture, you can incorporate it with flavors the kid does like. Sometimes it’s only the texture that’s the problem, and so kids will often eat the vegetable in another form that they won’t touch its raw or unblended form., From smoothies to chips to popcorn and pasta, companies are trying to make traditional snacks healthier. While products that rely on processed or dehydrated vegetables shouldn’t replace fresh vegetables, they can help augment veggie-poor diets. You can even try vegan versions of typically meat or dairy type products, as they often contain a lot of vegetables (check the label, though, because many of these products contain a lot of corn or soy).If you’re struggling to get your kids to eat vegetables, your kids might like veggie burgers. Veggies burgers are often made from rice, black beans, and other healthy vegetables. Check the label to make sure.
Your kids might enjoy fruit and veggie juices, or juice that contains both fruit and vegetables. Check the label to make sure the sugar content is not too high before implementing it regularly into your kids’ diets.
Many chip companies are now producing chips made with other vegetables than potatoes, including broccoli, beans and carrots. These chips are often quite tasty and can be paired with a nutritious veggie dip. Again, check the label to make sure the chips live up to their claims., With meat and cheese dishes it can be easy to slip a vegetable into the mix and the kids be none-the-wiser. For instance, if you’re making a homemade pasta sauce, you can blend vegetables in with the tomatoes. Then your kids will enjoy the pasta and get the vitamins and minerals they need., Sometimes, simply making the veggie look like some other yummy snack can make it more appealing. Whether you disguise cauliflower as mashed potatoes or root vegetables as fries, kids will likely find these versions more appealing than in other forms. And you may find a yummier alternative for yourself as well."

With time and encouragement, kids may grow to like even more vegetables, as well as to appreciate the time growing, picking, and preparing the vegetables from your garden.Some easy-to-grow veggies include peas, potatoes, and cabbage., Even if you don't have time for a garden, you can bring your kids to the grocery store. Let them pick out one or two vegetables that they think they will like. This will make your kids feel like they have some choice in the foods that get prepared at home., Cooking can make kids more invested in trying veggies, especially if they get to pick the recipes. Try to have several colorful cookbooks on hand with loads of easy veggie recipes. That way the kids will feel like they have lots of choices for healthy vegetable recipes they may like., Although it may seem difficult to get kids to eat enough veggies, it's okay to keep trying. It may take 15-20 tries before a child will accept a new food.Don't worry if the progress is slow, or they only like a couple of veggies at first.

If parents are routinely eating and snacking on unhealthy foods, how can children be expected to do any differently? Setting the right example to get children to eat right requires parental self-discipline. Parents need to provide loving and firm guidance in making healthy and wise choices regarding food and snacks.


It is most important to eat plenty of vegetables and fruits yourself. If you model positive behaviors, chances are your kids will copy you. Watch your body and facial expression as well when you try something new.;
, In infancy, children often get fruit and vegetable baby foods, once they start eating table food, what you eat is going to be a big influence on what your kids like to eat. If you rarely serve vegetables with meals or eat fruit, don't be surprised if your kids develop the same habit.

, Children typically do not like changes being made to their routines, so expect children to express their dislike to newly implemented changes in the family meal plan. Calmly explain that “this is what we’re having for dinner”, and if children adamantly refuse to eat the planned meal, simply cover it and save it for when they say they’re hungry. Remember, your home is not a cafeteria-style restaurant where children dictate what they will or will not eat. When the child later says they are hungry, simply say “Well that’s good because I saved your dinner for you”, then reheat as needed.

, For example, carrots have vitamin A which is good for skin and eyes. Make the connections between food and what it does for our bodies.

, For example, have them help when making salads or main meals together. They will be able to recognize what they are eating if they get to see it and feel it. It's also a great chance to discuss the food and get to understand its value better.

, Keep healthy snacks well-stocked at home, readily available and easily accessible for children to grab. Save cookies and other sugar coated treats for an occasional sweet treat or special occasions. Never get into the habit of giving children cookies or other sugary treats when the family meal is being prepared or is almost ready to be served. Consider offering a couple of bites of the vegetables or salad already planned for the meal to tide them over.

, When your children come home, have a plate ready with crunchy celery, carrots, and cucumbers on it. Serve it with dip if it makes it more enticing for them.

, Kids eat a lot when they are hungry or even bored, and if it's already prepared, they'll easily snack on the healthy foods.

, Vegetables can be served, raw, baked, steamed, grilled, in a salad, in juice form, stir-fried and broiled. Try a wide variety and in different ways until you find the vegetables that your child will like and in the style, they will like to eat them in.

, If your child likes macaroni and cheese, make it with steamed broccoli or peas mixed in. If your child likes spaghetti, mix in tomatoes, mushrooms, or peas and carrots into the sauce. Sometimes mixing right into their favorite foods makes them eat it without even noticing.

, Make your child part of the juicing experience and they may be more inclined to drink them. Combinations such as carrot, apple, and celery juice are usually sweet to the taste and a big hit.


Don't juice too often. It's far healthier to eat the food than to drink it.

, Most children love to dip items (i.e French fries in ketchup) so provide them dipping choices such as a salad dressing they might like and let them dip away. Always make vegetables ready to at and available with lunch, dinner, and snack. By having them readily, available your child will eat when they are ready.

, Find recipes that allow you to add fruit or vegetables to them, like banana or zucchini muffins.

, Try edible faces with carrot circles for eyes, strips of pepper for eyebrows, baby sweet corn for the nose and broccoli pieces for the mouth. Kids will enjoy helping with the composition, especially if you deliberately make a few anatomical mistakes. Add wild hairdos with shredded cabbage, watercress, or courgette ribbons.

, It is quick, so they get to see instant results. Try stir-frying peas, pepper strips, bean sprouts, and Chinese cabbage, or a mixture of sweet corn, small chunks of carrot and peas.

, Steaming or microwaving retains more nutrients than boiling. Although babies need mushy textures, older children prefer a little ‘bite’ and may like to eat their vegetables as finger foods.

, You can easily hide finely grated cauliflower and zucchini in rice, You can get puree pumpkin or squash and add it to spaghetti sauce or chili. But don't ever tell them or they may not eat that item again.

, For example, when making a salad, substitute 50 percent lettuce and 50 percent salad. Slowly introduce other vegetables this way.

, Cut up cabbage as finely as possible––you will be surprised how good it tastes on fish tacos or even burgers. The crunchy texture really appeals to children.

, For example, they can have popcorn with their movie if they eat some carrot and celery sticks with dinner.

, Children not only will respect the time and care it takes for food to grow but the responsibility of watering and weeding it will be another bonus.

, Sometimes children will eat when other children are around. It's great to try new foods at birthday parties, play dates, and sleepovers.

, Diapers are a much-needed baby supply and a popular theme for baby showers. The diaper candy holder in this article is made from a simple dinner napkin. Then, the favor is either filled with candy or has a cup of candy placed inside. Dip the candy holder in paraffin to make it extra sturdy.

, A favor cake is not an actual cake but a tradition that originated in Italy. A favor cake consists of a series of cartons assembled into a design that resembles a layer cake. A miniature favor is glued to the top of the cartons, while the cartons themselves are filled with sugared almonds and a personal note.

, These sugar cookies are cut into the shapes of baby items, like bibs and bottles, and then decorated with Royal icing. Royal icing, like fondant and other formed or rolled icings, not only decorates the cookies but also helps to seal in moisture and freshness. Royal icing supposedly used to be the traditional icing on fruitcakes, which were once the cake of choice for royal weddings in England.

Teach your child to choose at least one (if not two) veggies per meal. Don't expect them to like what you like, so expose them to lots of variety such as sweet peas, lentils, asparagus, zucchini, yams and bell peppers.
Children strongly mimic their parents, so it helps a great deal if you adopt healthy eating habits and slim down first before encouraging your kid to do the same — practice what you preach.
Avoid fatty, fried and breaded foods as much as possible. Learn other ways to prepare food, such as grilling, broiling, steaming, baking and sauteing.;
, Another strategy to help prevent your child from becoming too hefty is serving more moderately-sized portions.If left to their own devices, hungry children will pile food onto their plates because their ""eyes are bigger than their stomachs."" As such, dish up their plates for them when they are young and make sure they finish everything before allowing a much smaller second helping (if need be).


Your child will soon come to appreciate what a reasonable meal size is and won't be tempted to mound their plates and over-eat.
Portion size should roughly be equal to the food your child can hold with both their hands cupped together.
Start your child with a low-calorie salad with some raw tomatoes and veggies before serving them a smaller portion of higher-calorie protein (meats, fish, poultry) and/or carbohydrates (pasta, rice, potato, breads).

, Every child has a sweet tooth to a lesser or greater degree, so you have to be prepared to allow some types of desserts and treats on occasion. Sweet desserts and treats shouldn't be served after every meal, or even every day, but could be given a few times a week. Be creative and choose naturally sweet fruits for desserts, treats and snacks instead of sugary high-calorie types like candies, cookies and donuts.


A ripe banana, mango or a handful of sweet blueberries or grapes make great low-calorie treats and snacks.Add the ripened fruit to some frozen yogurt for a nice dessert.
Stock your kitchen exclusively with healthy treats, so your child has no other choice and is not tempted by baked goods and potato chips.
Unsalted nuts are also a good idea for treats. They're relatively high in calories and natural plant-based fats, but they are a good source of protein and minerals. Just make sure your child is old enough to eat nuts without choking on them. If anyone in your household is allergic to nuts, then do not keep nuts in your house.

, A significant source of calories and reason why so many kids are overweight now is the prevalence of sugary drinks (such as soda pop) in their diets. Consuming so much sugar in a short period of time causes the pancreas to secrete too much insulin hormone, which causes the sugar to be quickly stored as fat. As such, replace soda pop, energy drinks, sweet tea, artificial juice and milkshakes with mostly purified water, as well as some low-fat milk and natural fruit / vegetable juices.Drinking lots of water can help curb a child's appetite and make their bodies a little more efficient at processing nutrients and burning calories.
A small glass of water, low-fat milk or soy milk is appropriate with meals, but shouldn't be used as a crutch to ""wash food down."" Encourage your child to eat slowly and chew thoroughly before swallowing — they'll get fuller sooner.
To help your child get their recommended 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day, mix some in a blender with some frozen yogurt or almond milk and make a smoothie., Establishing a set time for when your child / family eats meals and snacks removes doubt associated with feeding times and reassures them that they won't feel hungry for very long. This will teach your child not to open the fridge and cupboards in search of calories whenever they get a twinge of hunger. The downside is that you'll have to prepare and serve most meals and snacks to your child, so set aside the time for it.


Your child shouldn't be eating right before bed because excess calories are more likely to be stored as fat instead of burned off, so restrict meals and snacks at least 2 hours prior to bedtime.Serve snacks about 2 hours after meals and choose ones that are nutritious, relatively filling (lots of fiber), but not too high in calories. Good choices include sliced apples, carrot sticks, wholegrain crackers, light popcorn, edamame beans and low-fat yogurt.

, It used to be much more common for families to eat meals together, at least dinners in the evening, but times have changed and schedules seem busier and more incompatible. However, eating with your child will allow you to observe and direct their eating habits, and they will be more impacted by your good example. As such, coordinate schedules and eat meals together as a family as often as possible.Eating together also stimulates important conversation and encourages closer family bonds, which is important for a child's confidence and self-image — both of which can affect weight.
Aim to eat together as an entire family for either breakfast or dinner on a daily basis. If the work week is too hectic, then definitely make time on the weekends.

, Although eating out can be fun and be good for family bonding, the food at restaurants tends to be fattening and relatively unhealthy, especially for growing children. As such, limit eating out, especially at fast-food restaurants, even though it seems convenient sometimes and a lot less work than cooking at home.When you do eat out, pick restaurants that have salad bars or go to ones that make their food fresh and made to order.
Make your own pizzas and hamburgers at home with healthier and fresher ingredients. Use more vegetable toppings and whole grain dough and buns, for examples.
Eating healthy at home isn't cheap anymore, but the money you save from not going to restaurants as much will help ease the cost of groceries.

, No matter how exciting the television show or movie is, the act of watching it is completely sedentary, which promotes weight gain if done too much and too often. Most researchers agree that older children should be limited to less than 2 hours of ""screen time"" (TV and computer combined) per day once they are away from school — and toddlers shouldn't be viewing any TV until they're older and more mature.Although reading and studying are also sedentary activities, the benefits far outweigh time spent in front of a TV.
Remember that it won't be effective to tell your child to quit watching TV if you are still on the couch gawking at it. The solution is to turn the TV off for extended periods of time.
Instead, encourage your child to find fun activities (board games and outdoor stuff) to do with family members or on their own that involve more physical activity and social interaction.

, Computer / video gaming and internet surfing has actually become more popular than TV for many children, so this has to be limited also to under 2 hours daily combined with TV watching.Kids are clever at sneaking onto the internet and playing games thanks to wireless internet and all the devices that can connect to it, so this won't be easy.


Instead of just severely limiting the computer time and letting them get bored, replace their computer time with physical activity that's not so sedentary and addictive.
Invest in a computer gaming system for the whole family that involves moving your bodies and getting fit, such as the Wii system by Nintendo.

, Once you have your child away from the TV, computer and gaming consoles, you need to fill the time with some physical activities that are perceived as fun or at least stimulating. In general, children and teens should get at least 1 hour of moderate-to-intense physical activity most days of the week, if not every day.Exercise obviously burns calories and either stimulates weight loss or maintains a healthy weight.


Good, safe physical activities that will get the heart pumping include brisk walking, hiking, playing tag, jumping rope, cycling and rollerblading.
As with eating, it'll help tremendously if you also adopt an active lifestyle and participate in the physical activities with your child. After all, you're likely their most important role model, at least while they're younger.
In addition to burning calories, exercise encourages stronger bones and muscles, better coordination and flexibility, and reduced risk of many diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

, If you think your child needs more structure or would benefit from the comradery and sociality of team sports / activities, then sign them up for something in your local community. Look into teams and activities to join at their school, church and community center. Appropriate choices include baseball, soccer, volleyball, tennis, swimming lessons and dancing.In addition to burning calories and keeping the weight down, your child will also learn important social and communication skills from sports and organized physical activities.
Sports don't always have to be competitive and high pressure if you're concerned about your child's abilities. Choose non-competitive ones if it's more appropriate.

Cook with your kids.,
Allow kids to make their own choices.,
Let your kids help you shop.,
Jazz up ordinary meals.,
Make the atmosphere fun.",How to Get Your Kids to Eat1," Getting your kids involved with the process is a great way to make them more interested in food. Most kids also love to ""help,"" so ask for some assistance when preparing your next meal. Treating cooking as a fun way to spend time together will make a positive impression on your child.Designate specific duties for your child. If they are very young, let them help you stir something, or shake the jar to mix salad dressing.
Choose the right time. Don't expect kids to enjoy helping if you are on a tight schedule and rushing to get everything done. Instead, try cooking together on an evening when you are not hurried.
Make sure to stress safety. Not only do you want your kids to learn about food, but you want them to learn that knives and stoves are not toys.;
, As they get older, kids begin to assert their independence. A great way to facilitate this process is allow them to have some input on the foods they eat. If you are having trouble getting your child to eat, try offering them a couple of different options.Present two healthy options as choices. For example, you can say ""Would you rather have peas or spinach as your side with dinner tonight?""
When offering your child new foods, have them rate or grade each one. Try saying, ""Here, try some sweet potato. What do you think?"" This shows your child you are interested in what they think.

, Try taking your kids to the grocery store with you. It can be fun for a child to be the designated ""produce picker."" Ask your kids what looks good. Encourage them to try new items. Your kids will be more invested in eating if they have picked some of the ingredients themselves.Try taking your kids to a local farmer's market. This can be a fun way to introduce them to new, healthy, foods.
Before you shop, ask your kids to help you menu plan for the week. Listen to their ideas, and take some of their suggestions.

, When you are dealing with a picky eater, it can be difficult to convince them that mealtime can be fun. Try to make each meal seem like an occasion, rather than a chore. For example, you could have a theme night for dinner.Your theme does not be complex. It can be as simple as ""Our Family's Favorite Foods,"" but it will make dinner seem more like a festive occasion.
Try cutting foods into interesting shapes. A sandwich shaped like a star, for example, is more fun than a regular sandwich.
Put faces on pancakes with raisins or banana slices.

, By making mealtime fun, you can help make food more appealing to your kids. Commit to having family dinner each night — or as often as possible. At dinner, try to talk about upbeat, happy topics. Maybe you could even have a joke of the day.Get your kids involved in the fun by letting them help you come up with new food combinations. For example, let them pick something new to dip veggies in, like a new flavor of hummus or yogurt.
Name some of your favorite dishes. Kids like to take ownership, so when she likes a dish, name it ""Karen's Cheerful Chili.""

Sneak vegetables into more foods.,
Find healthy treats.,
Lead by example.,
Establish a routine.,
Supplement with vitamins.",How to Get Your Kids to Eat2," Out of all the food groups, kids are most likely to resist eating their veggies. However, it is important that they get at least 5 servings of vegetables and fruits each day. There are several ways you can incorporate vegetables into common foods without your child even knowing.For example, you could puree a sweet potato or cauliflower and add it to mac and cheese.You can also add these purees to dishes like sloppy Joe's.
Chop spinach up finely and add it to cheesy scrambled eggs.Try making zucchini muffins or cauliflower crust pizza., Eating too much sugar can be harmful to your child's health. Keep your house stocked with healthy snacks and treats. Your child can only eat what you have in the house, so try to make sure that there are plenty of healthy choices available.If your child asks for candy, try offering her some fresh strawberries dipped in chocolate sauce as a healthier alternative.
Dried fruit is great to keep on hand for a healthy, sweet snack.
You can also make your own fresh fruit popsicles to keep on hand for a healthy dessert.

, The best way for kids to learn is to model positive behavior. You can set a good example by trying a variety of foods and enthusiastically trying new things. You can also demonstrate good eating habits by choosing healthy snacks for yourself.If your child sees you grab an apple as a snack, they will be more likely to do so themselves.
You can also set a good example by minimizing distractions. Don't allow TV or other electronics during mealtime. This will help your kids focus on eating.

, Children like both routine and predictability. It makes them feel secure and stable. Try to feed your child at approximately the same times each day. Aim for three meals and two snacks each day.Giver them a heads up. Let your child know when it is 15 minutes before mealtime. This will allow them a chance to wind down whatever activity they are involved in and mentally make the shift to focusing on eating.
Make it clear that meals are for spending quality time together. Ask your child to remain seated at the table until everyone is done eating.

, Sometimes you just can't convince a toddler to eat their vegetables. This doesn't mean that you have done something wrong, or that there is anything wrong with them. It is normal. Consider giving them vitamin supplements to make sure they are getting the proper nutrients.Talk to your doctor before adding vitamins to your child's routine. Often, kids are getting more nutrients than you realize. Be prepared with a list of all the foods your child is eating so that appropriate recommendations can be made.
If your doctor recommends adding a multivitamin, look for one that is appropriate for your child's age.
Make it clear to your child that vitamins are not candy. Keep them out of reach.

Respect your child.,
Be patient.,
Set boundaries.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Get Your Kids to Eat3," If you are able to communicate effectively with your child, you will be better able to convince them to develop good eating habits. One of the most effective ways to relate to your child is to treat them with respect. That includes respecting their appetite — or lack thereof.Don't try to force a meal on your child if they are not hungry. Instead, allow them to gradually adjust to the routine you have set.
Do not bribe your kids to eat. That could result in a power struggle, and it's not a good idea for either your or your children to try to use food as a weapon.
Instead, offer small portions until your child gets used to eating when and what they should. Smaller portions keep kids from feeling overwhelmed.

, Remember that they are kids. It might take your children a while to adjust to new things, and that includes food. If your child rejects a new food, don't give up. It may take a child over 10 times before they begin to eat a new food. Don't force them to eat the food, but continue to put it on their plate in small amounts.Manage your expectations. Remember that kids haven't fully developed all of their tastes yet. It's unfair to immediately expect your child to like all of the foods you like.
When you introduce new foods, focus on traits other than taste. For example, you can say, ""Look at this soup. Doesn't that look delicious? It also smells really good.""

, It is important to be patient and respectful. But it is also necessary to remember that as the parent, you are in charge. Set clear boundaries regarding your expectations.For example, don't allow your children to treat you like a short-order cook. You are not running a restaurant. Do not take ""orders"" for dinner.
Instead, get your kids involved with decision-making. And ask them to show you the same respect you are showing them.

, If you are concerned that your child is not getting the proper nutrients, you should talk to her pediatrician. Explain the situation and ask for advice. Make notes of what your child regularly eats and take them with you to the appointment. That is useful information for your doctor to have.Have your doctor come up with a meal plan that is nutritious and is acceptable to both you and your child.

Swap out packaged foods for whole grain varieties.,
Sweeten whole grain breakfast foods.,
Serve popcorn as a whole grain.,
Use quinoa as breading in kid-friendly foods.",How to Get Kids to Eat More Whole Grains1," If you feed your kids frozen or packaged foods on busy nights, you may be surprised to learn that you can get whole wheat versions of these items. When selecting convenient foods at the supermarket, opt for whole wheat whenever possible.


Breakfast foods like pancakes or waffles are often made with a mix or bought frozen. Instead of buying versions that use white flour, grab whole wheat waffles and pancake mixes.
Pre-made pasta foods, like mac and cheese, may also have whole wheat alternatives.;
, A great way to start off the day is a serving of whole grains at breakfast. However, many kids may be resistant to something like oatmeal or sweetened whole grain cereal. To make whole grains more tempting, try sweetening them up with fruit.Serve oatmeal with things like bananas and berries mixed in. You can also mix berries in with a bowl of unsweetened whole grain cereal.
You can also try a very small amount of brown sugar. Too much sugar is not good for children, but a spoonful will sweeten up the dish slightly and encourage your child to eat their whole grains.

, Many people do not realize popcorn is a whole grain. It can actually be a very healthy snack. You can make popcorn on the stove or microwave low-fat popcorn for a healthy snack.To make popcorn as healthy as possible, avoid seasoning it with things like butter and salt. Instead, use Parmesan cheese and herbs to season your snack.

, Quinoa is a nutritious whole grain that does not have a strong taste. It can be used as breading in kid-friendly foods such as chicken strips. Using quinoa as breading introduces whole grains into your child's diet in an appealing way.If your child loves whole grain as breading, they may eventually eat quinoa as a dish on its own.

Mix whole grains and white grains.,
Ask for whole grain substitutes when eating out.,
Go for whole grain bread.,
Substitute whole grain ingredients in your normal dishes.",How to Get Kids to Eat More Whole Grains2," If you have not fed your child whole grains in the past, they may be resistant to the new taste. You can make the transition gradually by mixing whole grains with white grains little by little.For example, if you're making pasta for dinner, use half whole wheat noodles and half white noodles. This will not make the change in taste as dramatic.
As the weeks go by, lessen the amount of white noodles you use in your pasta and increase the amount of wheat noodles. Eventually, work your way up to feeding your child only whole wheat noodles with pasta.

, If you go out to eat with your child on occasion, you may be surprised how often you can find whole wheats or whole grains. When ordering at a restaurant or fast food establishment, always check to see if you can swap white grains for whole grains.Many quick and convenient fast food places whole wheat options. Sandwich chains like Subway and Jimmy John's, for example, can usually provide whole wheat bread.
When your child is ordering at a restaurant, ask the server if whole wheat substitutes are possible. For example, if your child orders a pasta dish, see if you can get whole wheat noodles instead of white noodles.

, Bread is usually a staple in a child's diet. From toast for breakfast to sandwiches for lunch, your child probably eats bread on a regular basis. Always use whole wheat bread instead of white bread when serving your child bread. If you change the bread on your child's sandwich, and keep other ingredients the same, your c child may barely notice the shift.


You should also look for whole wheat versions of bread products like bagels and English muffins.

, Many recipes call for things like rice and breadcrumbs. If your kid already loves a certain recipe, swap out whatever ingredients you can with whole grain varieties. This will slowly introduce whole grains into your child's diet without them noticing.For example, make your standard meatloaf with whole grain breadcrumbs instead of white breadcrumbs.

Read food labels carefully.,
Read the nutrition label.,
Make sure whole grains contain plenty of fiber.,
Check to make sure whole grain items are fresh.",How to Get Kids to Eat More Whole Grains3," Unfortunately, food labels can sometimes be deceiving. Foods are often deceitfully labeled as ""whole wheat"" or ""whole grain."" Before purchasing a product, scan the ingredients label carefully to make sure it's genuinely whole grain.Often, foods are brown in color and labeled with terms like ""multi-grain"" or ""enriched."" Such products may not actually be whole grain. You may find whole grain is not listed close to the top of the ingredients list.
Truly whole grain products will include ingredients with the word ""whole"" as the first ingredients on the label. You should look for things like whole wheat flour, whole grain corn, and whole grain rice near the top of the ingredients list.

, Each product you buy contains a nutrition label outlining the amount of things like fat, sugar, vitamins, and so on in a product. When selecting whole grain products, pick the items with the lowest content of sugar and sodium. These are healthier than products higher in sugar or salt., One of the reasons whole grains are important to your diet is they help you get fiber. Fiber is necessary to your health and well-being. Select whole grain and whole wheat products that contain plenty of fiber.Any whole grain product you purchase should contain at least 3 grams of fiber per serving.
More is usually better with fiber, however. A product with 5 grams of fiber or more is an excellent source of fiber.

, Whole grain products, like breads and bagels, are often stored in bags. Before bringing a whole grain product home, examine the bag to make sure there are no cracks or tears. This could result in a product that's stale, moldy, or otherwise contaminated."

Open up the diaper, so that it is a long strip, and position it horizontally.,
Fold the diaper in half lengthwise.,
Start rolling the diaper tightly from one end to the other.,
Wrap a rubber band around the middle of the diaper to hold it together.,
Gently push on the bottom of the roll to form the peak, if needed.,
Tie a ribbon around the rubber band to hide it.,
Place the cupcake in a cupcake wrapper.,
Place a baby hair clip or hair tie on top of the cupcake, if desired.,
Consider making more diaper cupcakes and displaying them.",How to Make Diaper Cupcakes1," Make sure that the inside of the diaper is facing you. Do not unfold the adhesive flaps. Try to use a plain white diaper; this way, it will look more like frosting.;
, Keep the folded edge at the top, and the elastic edges at the bottom.

, Try to roll at a slight angle, so that your cupcake will have a nice peak. Make sure that the folded edge is making the peak, and not the elastic edge., Don't worry about what the rubber band looks like. You will be covering it up later.

, If the cupcake is still too flat for you, turn the cupcake so that the bottom, elastic edge is facing you, gently poke the center of the spiral with your finger. This will push the peak out further., You can also use an elastic baby hair tie or headband instead. If the baby shower has a certain theme color, consider using a ribbon that matches that color. You can also use pink if the baby will be a girl, and light blue if the baby will be a boy.


The width of the ribbon does not matter. It should be thick enough to cover the rubber band, but not so thick that it looks out of proportion. Something between ¼ and 1 inch (0.64 and 2.54 centimeters) would be idea.

, For a more personal touch, match the cupcake to the theme of the baby shower. For example, if the baby shower has a zoo theme, you could use a zoo themed cupcake wrapper. You can use a pink cupcake wrapper if the baby will be a girl, and a blue one if the baby will be a boy.

, This is not completely necessary, but it will give your cupcake a little more color. Don't pin or tape the decoration to the cupcake, as this can rip or tear the diaper when the expectant mother takes it apart. Instead, gently balance the decoration on top. You can also poke part of it into the center of the cupcake spiral to keep it secure.

, A cupcake box from a baker or a tiered cupcake stand would make a wonderful touch!

Roll a pair of baby socks up, starting from the toes and ending at the heels.,
Open up a diaper, then fold it in half lengthwise.,
Position the rolled up baby socks at one end of the folded diaper.,
Start rolling the diaper tightly around the sock.,
Wrap a rubber band around the center of the cupcake.,
Fold a baby washcloth lengthwise so that it is the same height as the rolled up diaper.,
Wrap the washcloth around the rolled up diaper, and secure it with another rubber band.,
Cover the rubber band with a pretty ribbon.,
Place the cupcake into a cupcake liner.,
Consider making more cupcakes and displaying them in a cupcake box or on a tiered cupcake stand.",How to Make Diaper Cupcakes2," Keep the socks together as you roll them. The tip of the socks will stick out of the top of the cupcake and look like a little decoration.Choose a solid-colored baby sock that contrasts with the diaper. Red, pink, or light blue would look great!

, Keep the folded edge at the top and the elastic edge at the bottom. Use a plain, white diaper if you can; this way, it will look even more like frosting.

, Make sure that the toe part of the sock is facing upward and sticking out over the edge of the folded diaper. The other end of the sock roll should be lined up with the bottom (elastic) edge of the diaper.

, This will make the frosting part of the cupcake. If you'd like to, you can roll it at slight angle so that it creates a peak.

, If you need to, use two rubber bands, one towards the top and one towards the bottom, for extra support. Don't worry about what the rubber band looks like; you will be covering it up. Set the cupcake aside when you are done.

, You may have the fold the washcloth into thirds. Don't worry if the washcloth is a little bit shorter than the diaper. This will make the bread part of the cupcake.Choose a washcloth that matches the baby's gender or the theme color of the baby shower.

, Keep the folded edge of the wash cloth at the top, and the loose edge towards the bottom. Make sure that the bottom of the washcloth is aligned with the bottom of the cupcake. Once you have the washcloth wrapped around the diaper, secure it around the middle with a rubber band.

, You can also use an elastic baby headband or hair tie as well. Try to match the ribbon to the baby's gender: pink for a girl and light blue for a boy. If you don't know the baby's gender, consider matching the ribbon to the theme color of the baby shower instead.


The width of the ribbon does not matter, but it shouldn't be too thick or too thin. Consider something between ¼ to 1 inch (0.64 to 2.54 centimeters).

, For a more personalized touch, use a cupcake liner that matches the theme of the baby shower. For example, if the baby shower's theme is fish, choose a fish-themed cupcake liner. You could also use a pink cupcake liner if the baby will be a girl, and a light blue liner if the baby will be a boy.

, This is not completely necessary, but it will give your diaper cupcakes that final, realistic touch.

Continue to make loops, gradually decreasing the size of each loop.,Tie florist’s wire or a piece of ribbon around the center of the loops to secure the loops.,
Fan out the loops.,
Secure the layered bow to the top of the umbrella.",How to Make Baby Shower Umbrellas," For example, if you have chosen a Rubber Ducky theme, you will need to collect rubber ducky designs for your umbrellas.;
, The ribbon that you use to decorate the umbrellas should match or complement your shower colors. Two colors should be sufficient.

, A white umbrella works well, but you may also choose a pastel color as long as the color complements the shower theme and the decorations. Choose the appropriate size of umbrella for your presentation and whether you have a particular preference for the type of handle it has.

, The picture should be wide enough to cover 2/3 of the umbrella panel’s edge and tall enough to cover 1/3 of the umbrella panel’s height. An image that is too small will not be visible from a distance.

, You will need one image for half of the total number of panels. If your umbrella has 8 panels, then you will need 4 images.

, Keep the steam function turned off.

, You can keep the umbrella closed. Simply flatten the panel over the board as much as you would flatten a section of a shirt before ironing it.

,


The applique should be placed with the image against the fabric and the transfer paper facing upward.
Place the bottom of the applique 1/4” from the bottom edge of the umbrella panel.
Center the applique between the 2 sides of the panel.

, This will ensure that the image doesn’t bleed onto the ironing board cover.

, Iron slowly without scorching the transfer paper.

,,,,, The edges of the ribbon should hang down, with one side of the ribbon crossing the other side at a 45-degree angle.

, The glue should go where the ribbons intersect at the bottom of the loop.

,,


Flatten the ribbon onto a table or work surface.
Create 2 loops in the center of the ribbon. Pinch the bottom of one loop with your right hand and the bottom of the other loop with your left hand.
Pull the left loop behind and around the base of the right loop.
Push the top end of the left loop through the loop that you just created.
Pull tightly, allowing the ends to dangle down. Make sure that each loop is evenly sized. The loops should look like mirror images of one another.

, The glue should go at the ribbon’s intersection but on the surface of the top ribbon rather than in between.

,, You can either cut the ends at an angle or use pinking shears. Make sure to use sharp scissors so that you don’t fray the edges of the ribbon.

,,,, Now, your umbrella panels should have one applique panel, followed by a ribbon panel. The alternating pattern should continue around the umbrella.

, You can choose miniature pacifiers, baby shoes or whatever matches the theme of your shower.

,


The ribbon should match your applique and double-layer ribbon.
The ribbon should be wide enough to cover the supports and the edge easily but not so wide that it obscures your applique design. The applique and the edging ribbon should gently overlap at the bottom of the image.

,, Start at the top of the umbrella and pipe the glue downward along one of the supports.

,,,,, You can start at any point along the edge.

,,, Allow the final end of the ribbon to overlap the front end by about 2”.

,,, Pinch the ribbon with your non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to pull the ribbon between your thumb and index finger. The amount of ribbon that hangs below your thumb will be the dangling end of the bow.

, This first loop will determine the diameter of your ribbon and should be at least 6” from left to right. Pinch the end of the large loop between the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand with the other length of ribbon.

, Again, pinch the end of the loop between the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand.

, Ideally, you should make at least 5 loops that gradually decrease in size.

,, You should have loops in both the foreground and the background of your ribbon for a layered look., You can use either florist’s wire or hot glue, depending on the way that the top of the umbrella is constructed. Use florist’s wire if the umbrella has a protruding piece on top, and use hot glue if the top is flat."

Start with a visit to your favorite local craft store.,
Choose an 8.5"" x 11"" vellum style(see-through)paper.,
Pick out an embellishment.,
Your next goal will be to pick out what will hold the two papers together.,
Using http://www.invitationland.com/, create a basic invitation.,
Print 4 per a page, on the three vellum pages.,
After they are done drying, stamp them, embellish them, whatever you're gonna do.

,
Then cut them out.,
Line up your print-outs on your chosen 12x12 paper or something similar.,
Line them up and attach them to the base paper using brads or ribbon.

,
Cut them out using a cutter or scissors, which ever you prefer.

Congratulations on your inexpensive, baby shower invitations!",How to Make Baby Shower Invitations," Find a base page that you love. It's preferred to use sheets that are 12 x 12, but it doesn't matter the texture, just make sure you love it. My choice was a baby print on a key-lime color.;
, This paper can be any color, just make sure it looks good over the base paper you picked out. This is by far the hardest part. Choosing coordinating papers can be time consuming and don't be afraid to ask for a second opinion. My choice was a plain white paper, no under-lying pattern.

, My theme was rubber duckies, so a cute stamp along with a stamp pad in blue was perfect. My goal was simple, yet elegant and it fit perfectly.

, I picked elegant brads that had colors that matched my base paper. I also considered using ribbon or ducky buttons, but found these brads were perfect.

, It is recommended that you use their footprint template and then make the footprint the same color to match the background(thus making it disappear), then fill in the information to your needs. It has a great printer setting where you can print one to four of the invitations on one page. This project uses their setting for 4 per a page.

, This will give you enough for 12 invitations. Let them dry for 5 minutes to avoid smearing.

,, It's recommended that you use a rotary cutter instead of scissors. Tearing isn't recommended for vellum paper.

, 12x12 paper sheets are perfect because it gives you exactly 6 invitations per sheet, so only two sheets are needed.

,,, Now go share them!

Try to include something cute or special.,

Check the baby registry.,
Apply ribbon and other finishing touches.,
Wrap the basket.,
Decorate the exterior again.",How to Make Baby Gift Baskets," While traditional themes like pinks and purples for girls and blues and reds for boys are still common, it isn't necessary to feel constricted by binary standards of gender assignment.Be sensitive to the needs of the baby's parents. If they are very traditional, it is probably safe to go with the ""Blue for Boy"" scheme. If the parents are more open-minded they may appreciate gender flexibility.


Common gender neutral colors such as yellow, green, orange, and brown can be used.
A good rule of thumb is to keep colors pastel and light.;
, You should then choose a baby-friendly theme for your basket. Some common themes include: Animals, polka dots, stripes, gingham/plaid, flowers, butterflies, circus, etc. The main point is to be fun and unique.

, Traditionally, craft stores sell fabric, plush, woven, and wood baskets. You could also go for a non-traditional basket that would be functional and could be filled with other goodies. A new car seat or even a baby bath work great if you want to take this route.


For traditional baskets, many prefer smooth and soft baskets that the baby could come in contact with.
For wood, wicker, and similar baskets be sure to check for splintering.
If the basket has paint or varnish, make sure that it does not flake and that it is nontoxic., Select the gifts that you will fill the basket with. Also pick up thick ribbon, foam or wood letters, bows, a card or tag, plastic wrap, and any other decorations that you want to incorporate.Make sure nothing is toxic, and watch out for small pieces that could break of and be hazardous for the baby.

, It's time to get to work! Line the bottom of the basket with a thin tissue paper and filler, letting the corners come just above the edge of the basket.You can also include a soft, plush baby blanket.

, Lanolin, cloth pads, breast pads, and cocoa butter are a new mother's best friends.Make sure that the baby's mom is comfortable and happy with a thorough smattering of postpartum necessities.

, Diapers and wipes aren't funny or cute, but they are necessary and expensive. Long after the thoughtfulness of a cute gift has worn off, the box of diapers you included will be much appreciated.

, The best gift baskets will almost always have something that is personal in them. A gift that hearkens back to an inside joke or a memory that you and the baby's parents share is always a nice touch. If you have your own baby, a gift from your baby to theirs works well.

, This is where you can get a little creative. Chocolate (and coffee!) might be much appreciated for late night cravings and early morning struggles. Gift cards are pretty common too, but options like an Amazon Prime or HBOGO Subscription might really stand out.


You could even order the couple Amazon Dash buttons for essentials like diapers, wipes, and laundry detergent.

, Sometimes it can be tough to find the right items to round out a gift basket. If you feel like you need to add a few other items, it doesn't help to ask other moms what they found most useful, necessary, or appreciated when they were new mothers.

, Some couples will create a baby registry, which is similar to a wedding registry. If a baby registry is created, you can use it to guide your basket. Just be sure to mark items as bought if you are taking care of them, so that there aren't duplicates!

, Wrap the handle in a thick ribbon and apply bows to the handle and front of the basket. Add a tag to the handle if you are using one. Arrange the rest of your small gifts and any cards in the top of the basket.


Consider using foam or wood letters to write the baby's name on the front of the basket.
Be careful with cards and gift cards. Make sure that they are on top and near the front so that they don't get lost in the filler.

, Once you are finished, wrap the entire basket in clear or colored plastic. This can be done with a pre-sized plastic wrapping bag or a cellophane sheet.Use a wrapping sheet by placing the basket over the sheet, grabbing all four corners, and pulling them up and over the handle of the basket. Bunch the plastic together above the basket and secure it with tape and ribbon.The leftover ribbon can be tied into a bow or curled for visual appeal., If desired, you can use this opportunity to decorate the basket once more. Stickers, bows, balloons and personalized writing can be added to the basket exterior and the plastic wrapping."

Tell your child you are pregnant.,
Make changes prior to the arrival of the new baby.,
Explain that the new baby will need a lot of attention.,
Talk about when your oldest child was a baby.,
Allow your oldest child to help out and make decisions.",How to Help Your Kid Overcome Oldest Child Syndrome1," It is important that you tell your oldest child that you are pregnant with a new baby. Your child should not learn about their sibling from another family member or friend. Explain that your oldest child is going to become a big brother or a big sister. This will give them a feeling of importance and they can begin to think about their new special role in the family.You may want to have your oldest child exchange gifts with the new baby so that they have a positive association with the baby.;
, Some changes will need to take place when the new baby arrives. For example, parents will need to divide their attention between their two children. If any changes are going to be made to your oldest child’s schedule, try and make those changes well in advance of the new baby. This way the oldest child will not resent their new sibling and associate the changes with the new baby.


For example, if the new baby is going to sleep in your eldest child’s crib, you should move your child to a different bed before the new baby arrives.
Alternatively, if the child used to get dropped off at daycare by one parent, but that is going to change when the baby comes, you should make that change well in advance.

, Have an honest discussion with your oldest child about what to expect when the new baby arrives. For example, you can explain that the new baby will need a lot of time and attention. You should also explain that the baby will only be able to eat, sleep, poop, pee, and cry. This way your older child will not be expecting a playmate., Some older siblings, especially toddlers, will demonstrate regressive behaviour when a new baby arrives. For example, they may begin to act like a baby or ask for a bottle. One way to avoid this type of behaviour is to look at photos and videos from when your oldest child was an infant. You can tell them stories about what they were like as a baby.You can also make it clear that they received a lot of attention when they were a baby as well. Explain how excited you were when they were born and how everyone came to visit them in the hospital. This will make them feel special too.

, Ask your older child to pick out a few decorations for the new baby’s room. This will let them feel like they are included in the decision making process. You can also allow the older child to be involved in some form of child care. For example, the oldest child can help get you a diaper or cloth for the baby. Alternatively, they can help pick out the clothes for the baby to wear.This will let the older child feel a sense of responsibility.
Avoid placing too much responsibility on your oldest child. You want them to feel included, but they are still a kid and need time to play independently. Always ask them if they would like to help out with the new baby, rather than making it a requirement.

"
Avoid comparing your children to each other.,
Provide them with cooperative rather than competitive games.,
Teach about conflict and resolution.,
Create family time.",How to Help Your Kid Overcome Oldest Child Syndrome2," In order to avoid the development of jealousy and competition between your children, avoid making direct comparisons. For example, when you are praising the accomplishments or successes of one child, focus solely on their actions and do not compare it to their sibling.For example, if one of your children gets a high grade in math don’t say “your sister gets good grades in math. Why don’t you?”
Instead, celebrate their individuality and uniqueness. This way each of your children can flourish and engage in activities that they enjoy.

, As your children get a little older and begin playing together, try and create cooperative games for them to play. For instance, see if they can clean up their toys within a certain time limit. This way they are racing against the clock cooperatively rather than racing or competing against each other., When your children get into a fight it is important that they learn how to resolve conflicts in a respectful manner. Teach them to look at each other when they are speaking. Make sure that they echo the other person's words to ensure that they have heard them correctly. Give both parties an opportunity to explain their side and allow them each to suggest a solution and agree to a solution.Guide them through this process at first, but eventually they should be able to do this on their own.

, Your children are less likely to develop intense rivalries if you spend quality time together as a family. Take a family vacation, eat meals together as a family, or engage in a family board game night. Children are likely to work out small disputes and disagreements with each other, if they share positive experiences."

Avoid putting too much pressure on first borns.,
Teach your oldest child to share.,
Set aside one-on-one time with each child.,
Avoid overly disciplining the oldest child.",How to Help Your Kid Overcome Oldest Child Syndrome3," First born children tend to be overachievers. As young children they are surrounded by adults and try and model the behaviours of the adults. They also receive a lot of undivided attention and praise from the adults in their lives. As a result, many parents set high expectations for their oldest children. For example, they want their oldest child to act as a role model for their younger siblings.Alternatively, some parents may feel that the successes of their oldest children are a reflection of their parenting skills. As a result, they place a lot of pressure on their oldest children to succeed. This can create a fear of failure.
Putting too much pressure on the oldest child can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety if they are unable to succeed as an adult.

, Older children can be bossy because they are used to leading, teaching, and at times dominating over their younger siblings. One way to reduce this bossiness it by teaching your oldest child how to share at a fairly young age. Children under the age of six years are not really capable of showing empathy, so it is unlikely that they will share toys on their own. In order to foster this skill, try time sharing. Set your watch for 10 minutes and let each of your children play with a favourite toy for the allotted time.This will teach your child patience, and how to take turns.

, Once your second child is born set aside special time that you can spend alone with your oldest child. This can help reduce feelings of jealousy and resentment. For example, take your oldest child to the library or the park. Alternatively, you could spend one-on-one time each night while reading bedtime stories. These moments of individual attention and love are important for the oldest child.This will help your oldest child realize that they do not have to compete for your love and attention and that you will always make time for them.

, In many instances parents will set stricter guidelines and rules for the oldest child. This is because they use the oldest child to set an example for the younger children in the family. For instance, by harshly disciplining the oldest child they warn the younger children about what behaviour will not be tolerated. These harsh rules do not always last for the younger children in the family, and in many instances younger children are coddled and more likely to receive financial aid from their parents well into adulthood.This inconsistency can result in older children becoming independent at a younger age and feeling jealous of the attention their younger siblings receive.
To avoid setting stricter guidelines for your oldest child, you should make sure that you keep the same rules (i.e. curfews) for all of your children. This way they will feel as though they received similar treatment.
If you provide younger children with financial aid as adults, you should also do the same for your older children.

Limit the exposure.,
Talk to your kids.,
Discuss unrealistic body images.,
Discuss how media messages affect us.,
Teach your kids to critically assess what they view and what they are told by media.,
Find alternatives to the power of advertising.",How to Help Your Kids Deal With Media Messages," The best thing that you can do is to reduce the hours kids spend watching TV and surfing the internet, where they are confronted regularly by media messages seeking the youth dollar. DVDs can make a good alternative to too much TV and internet usage should be limited anyway as part of a balanced day.


Radio and newspapers are generally less necessary to limit.;
, Be open and honest from the word go. Tell them what advertising is really about and what it is aimed to do. Kids will listen if you don't preach but just put the facts before them.

, This is vital. Kids pick up subliminal messages from toddler years about what is the ""right"" way to look and this can set them on the rocky road to unrealistic body image ideas. Explain what comes behind the ""perfect bodies"", such as airbrushing, plastic surgery, tricks of photography, severe dieting. After you have finished with this list of tricks and horrors, most kids will be squirming at the grossness of the details! There are also some great internet sites revealing airbrushing secrets if you need to do a show and tell to convince them.

, All of us, young and old. Perhaps cite a story of your own as to how you were affected when you were younger (or maybe even now!) and the consequences of that. Making it personal has greater resonance for children.

, Tell them not to accept things at face value but to look for facts and reasons, and most importantly of all, to ask questions. For kids who are old enough, explain how advertisements manipulate us by aiming for our insecurities, wants and fears. Show your kids how to critically assess information by doing it; do it actively yourself as you listen to the radio, TV, read the paper etc. Make a game of it for younger kids; for older kids and teens, praise their powers of critique as these form.

, There are many ways that you can offset the powerful messages of the ""perfect world"" put forth by media. Just some of them include:


Spending time with your kids doing things that don't involve materialistic outcomes, for example, prefer a hike over a shopping trip.
Teaching them the joy of making things with their own hands rather than buying every latest gadget on the market.
Helping them to enjoy food sensibly by encouraging a love of cooking in them early on so that they become familiar with the real textures, flavors and joys of real food.
Finding family rituals that establish their place in the world as a firm part of a stable, happy family. Reassurance and knowledge that they are loved and wanted is far more important than images of a ""perfect life"".

Give your child chances to build social skills in public settings.,
Help to model polite and outgoing behavior.,
Avoid focusing on the negative things in your kid's life.,
Provide encouragement and reassurance to your kid.,
Avoid labeling shyness as negative.,
Notice situations when the kid seems more shy.,
Avoid forcing them to be extroverted.,
Determine when your shy kid may need extra support.",How to Help Shy Kids Make Friends," While most kids will be hesitant to admit that they want your help, assess if your child is actually bothered by their limited group of friends. Some shy or introverted children are happy with few or no friends.


Helping your child to make friends may be anxiety-provoking for them. Pay attention to your child's actions and body language. They may be overwhelmed or frustrated if you work on making friends for them.
Notice if your child seems generally happy and content. If your child has few or no friends but seems to be happy, think about how the activities that they enjoy may be more independent. They may like to have more alone time.
Get their input before taking action with help to avoid assumptions.;
, Help your child understand what friendship means to you. Tell them what good friends do, and how to be a good friend in return. Make them feel like it's okay to have many friends or few friends, because it's the quality of the friendship that matters.Teach them that friendships become more important as they grow older, and that friends help you to feel happier and supported.
Discuss about what makes a good friend, and what makes a bad friend.
Help them to identify qualities in others that would make good friends such as reliability, kindness, understanding, similar interests or personalities, and trust.

, Avoid overwhelming your child with lots of other kids particularly if your kid is shy. Large social groups, even with three or four children, can seem intimidating for a shy kid. Focus more on one-on-one playdates with school or neighborhood kids.If your kid is under seven or eight, you may take a more active role in setting up play-dates.
Provide encouragement to your older kids in less direct ways. Consider saying, ""Want to invite a friend over this weekend? We could have a pizza night"" or ""Did you want to pick the movie for movie night this week? Maybe you could invite a friend over this time?""

, Sometimes shy kids may feel more awkward or anxious around peers who are their same age. They may feel more at ease with younger kids. Younger kids may make them feel more welcome because they look up to older kids.Encourage them to play with neighborhood kids that may be younger. Invite your neighbors over for a get-together and help to introduce the kids to each other.
Have your child grow more comfortable with others by interacting with other siblings, cousins, or relatives that are younger.

, Shy kids may need more encouragement to engage in team-oriented activities. Focus on team-oriented activities that they already have an interest in, rather than forcing them to do things you find more interesting.


For example, maybe your shy kid likes to do outdoor activities. You want to sign them up for little league, but they'd rather go hiking in nature. Focus on clubs like Boy Scouts or 4-H instead.
Even if the activities aren't group-oriented all the time, it can help to teach your child about social interaction. Consider pottery classes, swimming lessons, or gymnastics.

, Consider working with your child at home through role-playing first. By practicing ahead of time in a safe environment, your shy kid will likely feel more comfortable when talking in public.For example, role-play with them about situations at the grocery store, in a park, at school, on a playground, and at family gatherings. Use different scenarios of when people or kids are more friendly and less friendly.
Help to explain what to say or how to act if they encounter a difficult situation or person. But most of the scenarios should involve friendly encounters, so that it encourages them to act in public.
When they are in public, help to remind them of what they learned and how to act more open and friendly.

, A child looks up to their parents and adults for guidance about what to do and how to act. Be a role model for positive and respectful behavior in a variety of settings, both at home and in public.Show them how to share things and help others. Be a model for kindness towards others. Explain how helping others can often lead to friendships.
Talk with a diverse array of people. Instead of being irritated by others, show your kids how to be relaxed and friendly. Talk with the people in a check-out line. Engage in conversation with other shoppers at a store. Be open to asking questions or giving advice to others in public.

, If you’re constantly “checking in” on your child’s shy behaviors when they don’t have friends, you may make them feel even more like an outcast. Avoid constantly reminding them of the negative things they’re facing.For example, if you’ve just picked up your child from school, avoid asking them things like, “So did you eat by yourself again today at lunch?” or “So did you stay in class at recess again?”
Allow for more open-ended questions that led to more details with time. For example, ask, “Did you have a good day?” or “How was recess today?” and then follow up with questions such as “What made it a difficult day?” or “What activities did you do at recess?”

, Children who feel loved, supported, and appreciated will have greater confidence to do new things and interact with new people. New people or environments will seem less scary when they feel reassured.Build their confidence through words of encouragement such as, “You’ve got such great artistic talents. I bet other kids would want to see your work” or “You’re such as kind person. Helping others on the playground is great idea.”
Give them physical affection through hugs. Make them feel comforted and loved with hugs on a regular basis.

, Many people are shy, and are often simply born that way. Avoiding thinking that a kid's shyness is an automatic problem. While some kids are more outgoing with others, other kids take time to warm up to people.See shyness as a part of a kid's personality traits. Some people are extroverted and others are introverted. It's okay to be either.
Accept that not all children are the same. Shy kids actually tend to be better listeners and are less likely to get in trouble at school.

, Understand how the social environment may impact your child's behavior. Think about the times when your kid is most shy and when they are most talkative. Help to cultivate situations that lead to more talkative times.


Pay attention to how they act at home, at school, with other family members, and in public. When do they seem most relaxed and open? When do they seem least talkative?
Help to recreate situations that make them feel more open and interested. Make sure to engage them in the activities, rather than inadvertently making them feel left out.

, If you push your kid too soon, they will likely retreat or close off further from your efforts. This may be particularly difficult for you if you're more extroverted and talkative. Make sure to avoid putting them on the spot. Give kids a chance to express themselves at their own pace.For example, let's say your friends or family are visiting your home. Your kid has been practicing piano and you want to show off the kid's skills to your guests. Without warning, you ask your child to play for the guests. The kid will likely run off if they're shy or be too nervous to play.
Instead of pushing them suddenly while others are watching, talk privately with your child beforehand. Ask them if they would be willing to play. If they aren't yet ready, try small steps such as having them play in front of you or one other guest first, and then in front of a group of people.

, Some shy kids are deep-thinking and cautious in their behaviors, but also have a solid self-concept. Other kids who are shy may need additional support and counseling to help them with their fears or anxieties. Your child may need professional advice through your kid's school or a counselor if the child continues to display these behaviors:Persistent avoidance of school or people leading to school absences or missed events
Avoidance of eye contact and making other people feel very uncomfortable in their presence
Shyness that comes from a place of intense anxiety or anger, possibly due to abuse or trauma
Very low self-esteem in which depression and anxiety appear on a regular basis

Take steps to manage your own feelings and plans for coping.,
Build and use social support systems of family, friends, community organizations and agencies, faith-based institutions, or other resources.,
Understand that a child’s reaction to a disaster is brief and represents normal reactions to “abnormal events.” A smaller number of children can be at risk for more enduring psychological distress as a function of three major risk factors:


Direct exposure to the disaster, such as being evacuated, observing injuries or death of others, or experiencing injury along with fearing one’s life is in danger
Loss/grief: This relates to the death or serious injury of family or friends
On-going stress from the secondary effects of disaster, such as temporarily living elsewhere, loss of friends and social networks, loss of personal property, parental unemployment, and costs incurred during recovery to return the family to pre-disaster life and living conditions.

,
Know that in most cases, depending on the risk factors above, distressing responses are temporary.,
Encourage children and adolescents to share their thoughts and feelings about the incident.,
Listen to what the child is saying.,
Try to understand what is causing anxieties and fears.,
Create a reassuring environment for your children.,
Talk to a professional if you have followed the steps above and your child continues to exhibit stress, the reactions worsen over time, or if your children cause interference with daily behavior at school, at home, or with other relationships.,
Monitor and limit your family’s exposure to the media.",How to Help Children Cope with a Disaster," How a child copes with disaster or emergencies is often tied to the way parents cope because children can detect adults’ fears and sadness. Parents are almost always the best source of support for children in disasters. One way to establish a sense of control and to build confidence in children before a disaster is to engage and involve them in preparing a family disaster plan. After a disaster, children can contribute to a family recovery plan.;
, Parents can build their own unique social support systems so that in an emergency situation or when a disaster strikes, they can be supported and helped to manage their reactions.

,, In the absence of severe threat to life, injury, loss of loved ones, or secondary problems such as loss of home, moves, etc., symptoms usually diminish over time.

, Clarify misunderstandings about risk and danger by listening to children’s concerns and answering questions. Maintain a sense of calm by validating children’s concerns and perceptions and with discussion of concrete plans for safety.

, If a young child is asking questions about the event, answer them simply without the elaboration needed for an older child or adult. Some children are comforted by knowing more or less information than others; decide what level of information your particular child needs. If a child has difficulty expressing feelings, allow the child to draw a picture or tell a story of what happened.

, Following a disaster, children are most afraid that the event will happen again; someone close to them will be killed or injured; and that they will be left alone or separated from the family.

,


Personal contact is reassuring. Hug and touch your children. Spend extra time with your children such as at bedtime.
Calmly provide factual information about the recent disaster and current plans for insuring their safety along with recovery plans. Encourage your children to talk about their feelings.
Re-establish your daily routine for work, school, play, meals, and rest. Involve your children by giving them specific chores to help them feel they are helping to restore family and community life. Praise and recognize responsible behavior.
Understand that your children will have a range of reactions to disasters.
Encourage your children to help update your family disaster plan.

, You can get professional help from the child’s primary care physician, a mental health provider specializing in children’s needs, or a member of the clergy.

, News coverage related to a disaster may elicit fear and confusion and arouse anxiety in children. This is particularly true for large-scale disasters or a terrorist event where significant property damage and loss of life has occurred. Particularly for younger children, repeated images of an event may cause them to believe the event is recurring over and over.


If parents allow children to watch television or use the Internet where images or news about the disaster are shown, parents should be with them to encourage communication and provide explanations. This may also include parent’s monitoring and appropriately limiting their own exposure to anxiety-provoking information.

Avoid relying on television and junk food for your children.,
Encourage healthy eating.,
Help your child find a way to get exercise.,
Try individual or small group sports.,
Teach good eating habits.,
Help them pick out food.,
Explain that everyone should exercise and love their body, regardless of their size.,
Give them their own water cups, and have them refilled often.,
Talk about junk food.,
Encourage their self-esteem.",How to Help Your Child Manage Their Weight," It's natural to spend time in front of the TV, and get fast food sometimes, but don't allow it to become a family habit. This is bad for all of you.


When you want them out of your hair, bring out some cool toys or library books. Leave TV for special occasions, or only certain times of the day.
If you don't have time to cook, buy healthy microwaveable meals rather than constant fast food.;
, Keep healthy foods in your fridge and pantry, for both mealtimes and snacks. Talk about maintaining a balanced diet as a goal (not cutting out all fat), and about eating sweets in moderation.


Let them see you eating healthy foods.
Avoid controlling your child too much, or they will binge-eat when you aren't looking. This can lead to serious health problems.
Stay away from fad diets, diets that limit your food groups, or strict diets in general. If you constantly talk about controlling your weight, your child will learn that body fat and sweets are something to feel guilty about, leading to unhealthy behavior.

, Social children may enjoy team sports, and you can help them find out an activity that they enjoy attending. If they dislike it, allow them to quit, so they don't associate exercise with negative feelings.

, Some children may dislike the competitive or highly social nature of sports, and that's okay—it's more important that they learn that exercise is fun.


Play backyard sports as a family, without keeping score.
Make sports a collaborative effort: work together to make baskets, pass a ball around, or practice hitting a baseball.
Keep outdoor toys and sports equipment easily accessible, so they can run out and play whenever they like.
Try incorporating walks and hikes into the family routine.

, It's important that all children have a healthy attitude towards food.


Fill up between 1/3 to 1/2 of their plate with fruits and vegetables.
Encourage them to snack if they feel hungry.
Explain the importance of only eating when they are hungry.

, Take them with you down the fruits and vegetables section of the grocery store, and ask them to choose some foods for you to make. If your kids have a say in what healthy foods come home, they are more likely to eat those foods.

, Chubby children may feel ashamed about their weight, causing them to hesitate to exercise and not take good care of their bodies. Don't let this happen. Tell them that they can be strong and active people, and that their body is not a hindrance.


Expose them to pictures of fat athletes and fat children exercising and having fun.
Never criticize or make fun of people for being fat.
Love your body, and let your children see you loving your body. They will copy you.
Limit their exposure to magazines and TV, as these feature overly-thin casts and may lead to diminished self esteem.

, Hydration will help them stay energetic and healthy. The water cups can come with you in the car, at the table, and at their desks.


Go to the water bottle section of a store. Have them pick out a reusable cup in their favorite color, possibly with cartoon characters on it. This will help make it feel like it's theirs.
Young children, or children who have poor motor skills, may need a sippy cup to avoid spills.
Add a silly straw to make it more fun and easy to drink from.

, Explain that everyone eats some, and that it's perfectly okay as long as you eat it in moderation. Allow them to have a small/moderate amount at a certain time period (e.g. cookies for a bedtime snack). Let them know that it's nothing to be ashamed of.


If one sibling is thinner, do not give them more junk food than their chubbier sibling(s). This will upset them and make the chubbier sibling(s) feel that they deserve more too.
If your child is sneaking junk food, make healthy snacks more available, especially ones with healthier fats (e.g. nuts and peanut butter). Talk to them if secretive eating becomes a problem.
Never let them see you being guilty about food. Eat dessert and enjoy it!

, Don't make your praise contingent upon lost weight—teach them to always love themselves as they are. When they love their bodies, they'll take good care of them, whatever their weight may be.


When you go shopping with your daughter, help her pick out a cute swimsuit. Praise how adorable she looks, and gently joke about fending off boys at the swimming pool. This will help her learn that it's okay to swim in public.
Never utter the word ""slimming"" when it comes to finding clothes. It teaches children that their body is something to be minimized. Let them have fun with their wardrobe.
Cultivate inner beauty.

Brainstorm the plans you need.,
Come up with a signal.,
Let everyone know where to go.,
Talk about who to contact.,
Create a Plan B.,
Practice your plans.",How to Help Your Kids Feel Safe1," Sit down with your kids and talk about what safety plans you need to have in place.This is a good way to help them feel safe because it involves them in the planning process, which may help them remember the plan better. It also shows them that you’re thinking about their safety.


Talk about plans to keep you and your kids safe from danger from other people. For example, you may want to develop a plan for handling it if an unknown adult approaches your kids.
Visit the Red Cross website at http://www.redcross.org/, the FEMA website https://www.fema.gov/children-and-disasters, or https://www.ready.gov/ to find out what natural disasters are possible in your area so that you can prepare for them. Choose one or two situations that are most likely to occur and develop a plan for them. Making a specific safety plan for every possible occurrence could leave your child confused and more scared.;
, In some safety plans, you may need a signal to let each other know that it’s time to follow the plan. The signal should be something everyone is aware of and can do. Let the kids have a say in what the signal for each plan will be.


Some signals may be things like fire alarms, tornado sirens, house alarms, etc.
Other signals may be words or phrases. For example, “Evacuate” or “Go to the safe place” might be signals that you use.
Some signals may be non-verbal. For instance, two hand squeezes may be a signal that one of your children feels uncomfortable around someone but doesn’t want to say so out loud.

, It can be confusing for adults and kids when an emergency situation happens. Including specific instructions for where to go in the case of an emergency should be a key part of your safety plans.Knowing that you have some place to go in the case of an emergency will also help your kids feel safe.


Designate one place as a ‘safe spot’ where you all can meet if you need to evacuate or get separated. For example, you might decide to meet by the garage or even by the restaurant down the street.
Make sure that your kids know the safest way to get to the safe spot and what to do once they get there. For instance, you might say, “Climb out your bedroom window and go to Mrs. May’s.”

, This will help your kids feel safe because they’ll know that they won’t be alone if a scary situation occurs. They’ll know who to turn to for help. Talking with your kids about who to contact, how to contact them, and how to contact each other should be something you consider for all of your safety plans.For example, you may instruct your kids to let their teachers know if they notice someone suspicious in the school.
Or, for instance, you might talk about different ways you all can contact each other if you’re separated. For instance, you might say, “If we’re separated, go to the ‘safe place’ and call Grandma.”
Discuss how to get in contact. Consider that in some situations you may not have access to a phone. Talk about alternative ways you can contact each other like email, other people, or community bulletin boards.
Talk about what information you should provide to people. For example, you might say, “If we get separated in an earthquake, find a police officer and tell them your name, our address, and my name.”

, Things don’t always go as planned in stressful or emergency situations. Having a backup plan is a good way to make sure that you have alternative ways to stay safe.It can also address some of your kids’ concerns by letting them know that you have several ways to stay safe.


Talk about alternate evacuation routes, signals, and meeting places.
You should also talk about how to know when to go to ‘Plan B’. For instance, you might say, “If the front door is blocked, Plan B is to go out of the side door. So, Plan A is front door, Plan B is side door.”
Don’t worry about having a ‘Plan C’ or ‘Plan D’ as this may get to be confusing.

, While developing safety plans can help your kids feel safe, practicing the plans may actually keep them safe.Practice as many parts of your safety plans that you can so that your kids feel confident and comfortable following through with the plans.


Practice giving the signal and how you should respond when it’s given. For example, practice what you all should do if you hear the smoke detector go off.
Start practicing your safety plans with your kids once they are about pre-school age, or four or five, and can follow two to three step directions.
Practice evacuating or getting to your ‘safe space’ quickly and safely.
Role play how you will contact each other and what information should be given when you do contact someone.
Practice your safety plans a couple of times each year or every few months to make sure everyone remembers what to do.

"
"
Keep emergency supplies.,
Pack Go-Bags.,
Post an emergency contact list.",How to Help Your Kids Feel Safe2," One way that you can help your kids feel safe is by letting them know that you are prepared for unexpected situations. Keep emergency supplies on hand and make sure everyone (adults and kids) know where they are and how to use them.For instance, you might show your kids where you keep the first aid kit at home and in your vehicle.
Make sure you all know where flashlights, blankets, water, and other emergency supplies are kept.
Keep prescriptions in a place that you can locate and transport them quickly if needed. For example, you might keep a cooler on top of the refrigerator to transport insulin in an emergency.

, In some cases you may need to evacuate your home in a hurry. You can make this a quick, safe process and keep your kids calm if you already have ‘go-bags’ packed and kept somewhere with easy access.Pack a bag containing a set of clothing and toiletries for each person.
Include items like batteries, non-perishable food, medications, copies of important documents, and even a small memento in your ‘go-bags’ to help calm your kids.

, If your kids know who to contact in a scary situation and how to contact them can help them feel safe. Work with your kids to create a list of people or organizations they can contact when they don’t feel safe.


For example, you might include your work and cell number on the list, along with your email address.
Or, for example, you may put family friends, community members, or other trusted adults on the list.

"
"
Listen and answer questions.,
Be honest.,
Stick to the facts.,
Talk about feelings.",How to Help Your Kids Feel Safe3," There may be times that your kids come to you with concerns about their safety because of something they’ve seen through the media or heard from a friend. You can help your kids feel safe by listening to their concerns and answering their questions. This will show them that you care about how they feel and their safety.


Remove any distractions and give them your undivided attention when they want to talk about safety issues. For instance, turn the TV off if your son says he’s scared to go to the park.
Listen to what they are saying as well as how they are saying it. For example, do they say everything’s okay but their voice is wavering and shaky? Things might not be okay.
Answer their questions instead of dismissing their concerns. For instance, instead of saying, “Oh, don’t worry about that,” try saying, “That is something to think about. We can handle it in a lot of ways.”
Make sure you are not giving dismissive nonverbal cues while you talk, such as smiling or laughing when they voice their concerns. Instead, nod, make eye contact, and keep a straight face.

, Kids are quite perceptive and can often tell when you aren’t being exactly straightforward with them. In situations of safety, feeling that you’re hiding something from them may cause them to feel even more afraid.For example, if your kids ask if there might be a terrorist attack in your community, you might say, “Yes, that’s possible, but very unlikely. We have several things in place to stop that from happening and to help us stay safe and recover if it does.”
Or, for instance, if they ask about human trafficking, you could say, “That does happen more than we’d like and it is scary. Let’s talk about how we can stay safe and how we can help others stay safe, too.”
Keep in mind that what you tell your children and how you say it will depend on their age. You wouldn't talk about a possible terrorist attack with a young child in the same way you would discuss it with a teenager.

, The world can be dramatic enough for kids without adding on any embellishments of our own. When you talk with your kids about things that are going on or that they have heard about, stick to the facts of the situation and avoid speculations or dramatizing. Discuss it when you are in a calm emotional state, as children can easily pick up on your mood.For instance, you might say, “They think a bomb may be there. That’s why they’re investigating and helping people evacuate just in case.”
Or for example, you could try something like, “The news did report that a man dressed like a clown robbed a store. But, no, that doesn’t mean that there are killer clowns roaming our city.”

, This can be an important part of communicating with your kids because adults sometimes forget that there is a difference between being safe and feeling safe. You may know that you have ways to keep your kids safe, but you should still check in with your kids to see how they feel.For instance, you may be safe from a storm in your home, but you may feel afraid because of the sound of thunder.
Feeling safe can also mean the difference between kids confidently following a safety plan or hesitating out of fear.
Ask your kids, “How do you feel about our safety plan? What things worry you? Do you think we need to do anything to be safer?”

"
"
Stay calm.,
Refer to your plan.,
Seek immediate professional assistance.",How to Help Your Kids Feel Safe4," You can’t prevent some things that may threaten your kids’ safety from happening, but you can handle the situation appropriately so that you and your kids stay as safe as possible. One of the main things you can do during a difficult situation to help you all stay safe and feel safe is to stay calm.Kids often take their cues from adults, so if you’re calm, it may help calm them which can help you all do what you need to do to stay safe.


Take a few deep breaths to calm and center yourself. Inhale through your nose slowly and then exhale slowly through your mouth a few times.
Try to become aware of any tension in your body — unclench your hands and jaw, relax your shoulders, and so on.
Remind yourself and your kids that everything is going to be okay. You might say, “Stay calm, everyone. We’re going to be okay.”

, If you have a plan in place for the situation, then use it. Referring to your plan will help you and your kids stay safe and feel safe because you already know what you need to do. This can help make the situation less frightening and stressful.


For instance, if you all hear the hurricane siren you could say, “Alright, kids, time for Hurricane Plan. Let’s get to it.”
If it helps, quickly run through the steps together. For example, you might say, “Remember, go to the safe place, get down, cover up, and wait.”

, Professionals are trained and have the experience to help you handle a lot of different situations. They also have several different techniques and strategies to help you stay safe and feel safe. Talk to the appropriate person if an emergency or difficult situation arises.If anyone is injured or in eminent danger you should contact help immediately by dialing 911.
For example, if someone tries to approach your kids aggressively you would report it to your local police.
Or, for instance, if there was a natural disaster, you might contact your local Emergency Management Agency or other community organization.

"
"
Give them extra attention.,
Stick to a routine.,
Stay positive.",How to Help Your Kids Feel Safe5," After something frightening happens kids may feel afraid or act extra clingy. This is a good time to give them some extra attention in order to reassure them and help them begin to feel safe again.It’s also a good way to observe them and determine how they are coping with what happened.


It’s okay to give them extra hugs, pats on the back, or to hold their hand a bit more. The physical contact can help reassure all of you.
Ask them to help you out with small tasks. The extra attention will help them feel safe. The task may give them a sense of purpose and may distract them from dwelling on what happened.

, Consistency and order can help kids feel safe because they know what to expect and what to do. This can be especially true after a difficult or emergency situation has occurred. Do what you can to create and stick to a routine so that your kids can redevelop a sense of normalcy.For example, if you are staying in a temporary disaster shelter, have a bedtime routine with your kids of washing your face, brushing your teeth, and reading a book together.
Or, for instance, if someone has broken into your home you might develop a routine of locking the doors and engaging the alarm before you all go upstairs to get ready for bed.
Try to keep their routine at this time as close as possible to their normal routine. For instance, getting them back in school as soon as it is safe can help return that sense of normalcy.
Allow your kids to play, laugh, draw, read, and do the things they normally do (as much as possible).

, Your attitude about a situation can have a big influence on how kids handle it and react to it. Do what you can to stay positive and maintain a good attitude so that your kids can feel safe and maintain a positive attitude also.Think of this as a teachable moment. You can show your kids how to stay calm and positive even when something bad happens.
Be grateful for what you do have and for what is okay. For example, you might say, “The fire did ruin the table, but we handled it quickly and stopped it from spreading. I’m grateful for that.”
Try using humor as a way to stay positive. For instance, you could joke, “Well, we did want to remodel that room,” if a tree falls into your den.

Realize that signs of depression in kids are often different from the symptoms you find in adults.,
Listen to what they say.,
Notice any distance between them and family.,
Look for physical symptoms.,
Keep a log.,
Be there for your child.,
Listen closely and help them process their feelings.,
Remind them how much you love them.,
Be patient.,
Make it clear to your child that you don't blame them.,
Treat your child the way you would want to be treated.,
Realize that you may need support in knowing how to support.,
Set up a doctor check-up for your child.,
Get effective treatment.,
Support your child and be active in their treatment.",How to Help Young Children with Depression," For a child, the symptoms may include:


Fatigue and sleeping more
Irritability
Giving away beloved toys
Unexplained aches and pains
Growing bored and withdrawn
Staying in their room for long periods, especially to avoid family interaction
Loss of interest in things they used to like.;
, Hopelessness and helplessness can come across as negative self-talk. For example, ""I can't do anything right"".

, Depression can cause people to feel unloved and unwanted (regardless of evidence otherwise). Your child may question how much you care about them or whether are available to spend time with them.

, Young children may not understand emotions very well, and would complain of physical problems rather than the emotional ones that caused it. Physical pains that can't be explained by another illness may be signs of depression.


Headaches
Stomachaches
Feeling tired
Other aches and pains

, It can be helpful to keep a journal of your child's symptoms, and write notes on their behavior. You can show this journal to professionals when you are seeking help for your child.

, Learn how to support your child and continue to support them. Pay close attention to any hints your child may drop about wanting to talk; do what you can to make them feel better without dismissing their feelings.

, Listen to how they describe the situation, help them identify their emotions, and treat the problem as valid. A broken crayon may not mean much to you, but to a young child it can be a terrible disappointment. Seek to understand how they're feeling, and respect those feelings.


""You seem upset. You have a big frown on your face and you're looking down. Would you like to talk to me about it?""
""So, you're feeling upset today because you can't find your stuffed kitty?""
""Well, I can see why you would feel frustrated about that. Let's figure out a way to deal with this problem.""

, Depression can cause irrational thoughts about being unloved and unwanted, and you can combat that by proving them wrong. Spend plenty of time with your child, hug them, and tell them you love them.

, Depression isn't fun, and it's natural to feel frustrated and worried sometimes. Remember that your child isn't depressed on purpose. Their emotional pain is genuine, and they need you.

, Scolding, yelling, and ""tough love"" do not help depression, because depression is not a choice. Treat your child like they are doing the best they can in a difficult situation.


Keep in mind that depression can lower children's self esteem, so they may feel very bad about themselves.

, Depression is different for every one, but regardless of how it manifests, keep showing your care and support for your child. Make sure that your child always knows he or she can trust you, both now, and in other times of distress.

, There is no shame in this; parents aren't born with an internal guide for getting it right. Get advice from your doctor, a teacher, a counselor or a family member who has been through this before.


It may be worth setting up several appointments with a psychologist for yourself. A psychologist has handled depressed people before, and can give you good advice.

, Other illnesses such as diabetes, anemia, mononucleosis or a simple infection can mimic symptoms of depression. It is also really helpful to have the support of your doctor in managing childhood depression; once again, there is no guidebook on how to help a child and your doctor will be able to give you great advice.


Talk to your doctor about what is going on. They can rule out other illnesses and then give you referrals or prescribe short term medication.

, If medication is advised and agreed upon, make sure that the medication is properly given and never forgotten. In terms of talking and counseling, make sure that all the therapist appointments are kept.

, Keep across your child's progress or lack of progress so that you are better equipped to help. At any time you feel incapable of helping, realize that you are a loving parent first and provide love, and that there are plenty of people able to help you should you need it.

, You must be interested first. That means you must observe quietly and unobtrusively. You must notice things to show them.

, For smaller children, a pretty leaf is enough to interest them. Or a bug, a flower, even if it's common, a bird, clouds, a rocky hill-- all can be interesting to notice details of.

, This means less talk at first. Teach children to be quiet and still around animals, with their hands at their sides.

, Help children notice through guided questioning, a series of simple questions leading from the obvious to the point you want to make.

, Show them the habit of questioning, being curious. Show them that an inquisitive mind is rewarded.

, Younger children can draw what they see, older children can keep a log, a list, a journal.

, For younger children, plants and animals is a good start. For older children, animals vs. bird, or trees vs. vines may be better.

, Show them parts of a leaf or flower, the colors of the rocks, the colors on the bird.

, Ask them not only to see but also hear, smell, and touch. Ask them to describe each kind of sensory impression. Be careful of tasting unfamiliar plants, though.

, Ask them what they enjoyed, to stimulate discussion. Ask them what they want to know more about.

Give your child a peaceful and calm place to recharge.,
Find other highly sensitive children for your child to play with.,
Choose a different way of disciplining your child.,
Consider getting a service animal or calm pet.",How to Help a Highly Sensitive Child1," Highly sensitive kids need time to settle down and regroup. They also tend to be quite shy, so they usually need some alone time. Create a space in your home that offers a quiet, safe place where they can relax and feel comfortable.

Since highly sensitive children like soft surroundings, fill the space with pillows and blankets that are smooth and comforting. Soothing colors can be helpful. Also, make the area away from the loud parts of your home, as sensitive children are overwhelmed by noise and commotion.;
, Children who are prone to feeling emotion more than others want to know they aren’t alone. They also typically get along quite well with others who are just like them, as they are generally more in tune with each other’s feelings and may be more sensitive to each other’s needs. Giving them time to play with others who are like them may help them to be more accepting of their feelings, and learn that it’s OK to just be themselves.

Looking for children who are like your child may take a bit of effort, but it will be well worth it. Observe the children your child goes to school with, and attempt to set up a play date with the parents of the child who is like yours. You might say, “It’s hard for me to find other children who play like Katie. Do you want to set up a play date for the two of them?”
You can also ask your child’s teacher if there are any other children who are highly sensitive that your child may get along with, and then organize a playdate with their parents.Try to keep playdates within a short time frame and make sure that you listen and watch for clues that they are running low on energy. Also, keep in mind that even after these kind of play dates, sensitive children will still need to have that ""down time"" to rejuvenate themselves.

, All children need discipline, even those that are highly sensitive. However, these children often respond to traditional discipline more severely than typical children do. You’ll likely find that discipline such as yelling, spanking, and putting them in time out often creates the very behavior you want to avoid: temper tantrums, screaming, and crying. Choose a more gentle, yet effective, punishment for bad behavior.

Talk to your child about the type of behavior you expect before the situation escalates. For instance, before you go into a store, tell your child how you want them to act. You might say, “You will stay with mommy the whole time, and not wander off by yourself. Okay?”
If they don’t comply, remind them that you both discussed the situation before and that they agreed to behave properly. Highly sensitive children usually respond better when they are in a partnership with their parents, rather than feeling like they are alone in the situation., Having a well-trained calm pet can also help your sensitive child. If your child is not allergic to cats or dogs, then consider getting one to help your child feel calm. Check your local shelter to see if they have any calm dogs or cats that might make a good companion for your child.

However, keep in mind that caring for a pet can be expensive and time consuming. You will need to be willing and able to care for the pet for its entire life, which can be anywhere from 10 to 20 years.

Tell your child to count when they start to feel upset.,
Teach your child calming phrases.,
Tell your child to talk about what is upsetting them.,
Rehearse scenarios to help your child stand up to bullies.,
Connect your child with a professional therapist.",How to Help a Highly Sensitive Child2," Your child likely can’t help or stop having an intense reaction to something that is upsetting. However, you may be able to distract them by having them count when they feel like they want to cry. Counting could prevent the outburst, and if it doesn’t, it could make the reaction less severe and shorter in length.

Say to your child, “When you get upset, count to ten.” If possible, count with the child. Counting may get their mind off of what was upsetting them. You can also turn counting into something fun. By making silly faces at each other, you’ll likely alter the child’s mood and change the moment from upsetting to funny., When you’re not there to help, your child will need to learn to calm down on their own. One way is by repeating calming phrases. This can also help later in life and teaches them they are able to cope on their own.

Tell your child to say things like, “I’m OK,” “This won’t last long,” or “I can handle this” when they start to feel overwhelmed or upset. They may also find that praying or singing a song to themselves when they start to feel like they are going to lose it helps to calm them down., Children may not realize what the problem is so they simply choose the one form of communication that has always worked for them: crying. Stopping your child when they are in the midst of their meltdown and asking them what upset them so much may make them feel better, as they are getting it off of their chest. However, some kids just need time to let it out and then they will feel better after. You may find that eventually the child turns to dialogue as their form of problem solving, instead of throwing a temper tantrum.

Ask your child why they are upset. They may need some prompting from you, such as “Are you mad because your friends won’t play with you?” When they respond, ask what they can do to make themselves feel better.
At first, you may need to offer ideas. Eventually, your child will likely be able to come up with solutions on their own, without any help from you., Highly sensitive children may act differently than others their age, crying or becoming afraid in seemingly normal situations. This can put your highly sensitive child at risk for teasing or bullying at school. It can be practical to prepare your child for this by role-playing.Go through some situations that may occur and teach your child how to respond. For instance, if another child calls your son a ""cry baby,"" explain how he can tell the teacher or simply ignore the comment.
Give your child tips on avoiding bullies like going to classes in a group of other students and walking with their chin up and shoulders back to portray confidence.Be sure to discuss your child's needs with your child's teacher and school counselor to ensure that your child gets the support they need.

, Getting your child the appropriate services can greatly increase their chances of functioning well at school and at home. Talk to your pediatrician to decide what type of therapist may be best for your child. This will depend on some of the specific issues they are experiencing such as anxiety. Choose a therapist who has specialized training in this area.

In addition to therapy, it may also be helpful to have your child receive mentoring from a highly sensitive adult or participate in support groups with others who are like them."

Celebrate the benefits of having a highly sensitive child.,
Let go of the idea that you can “change” them.,
Understand that there are physical reasons for the sensitivity.",How to Help a Highly Sensitive Child3," Kids who are highly sensitive are often more compassionate towards others and often have lots of empathy. They are also usually quite creative and are intuitive to the needs of others.

Additionally, highly sensitive kids tend to fall in love deeply, are responsible, gentle, and usually make great peacekeepers. Focusing on your child’s gifts, rather than their challenges, can help you appreciate and better deal with them., Highly sensitive children can’t help what they feel, just like you can’t help the way you feel. They just may feel things more deeply than you and react differently. Instead of attempting to change their sensitivities, a more effective approach is to help them learn coping techniques for times when they are upset., Does your highly sensitive child find certain clothing materials unbearable to wear? Are loud noises too much for them to take? This is likely due to having nervous systems that are highly reactive and respond quicker and more intensely to certain stimulation.

Know that your child’s behavior is due to a physical condition in addition to an emotional one. Sometimes, getting a better understanding of their condition may help you realize they aren’t just being “dramatic.”"

Choose a good time.,
Tell your child that the dog has died.,
Explain death.,
Answer their questions.,
Consider what is appropriate to tell your child.",How to Help Kids Grieving the Death of Their Dog1," While you may want to tell the child as soon as you know about the death, you should wait for an appropriate time. Do not tell the child about the dog’s death right before they have to go to school or to bed. This may cause them to have trouble concentrating or sleeping.After they return home from school is a good time to tell them.


If you know in advance that the dog is dying or that you will need to euthanize the dog, you can start the talk early. You can say, “Roger is very old and sick. The vets did everything they could, and now we have to say goodbye. This is the nicest thing that we can do for him. He will die peacefully and without pain.”;
, Use direct language. Tell your child that the dog is dead. Do not use euphemisms like “Bailey went to sleep” or “Macy is now in heaven.” Young children often take these very literally, and it may scare or confuse them.You can say, “We have very sad news. Daisy died today.”
Avoid telling your child that the dog ran away. This may confuse them, and they may expect the dog to return., The death of a family dog may be the first time the child has lost someone in their life. Your child may not understand that their dog is gone forever. This may be a good opportunity to teach young children about death and mourning in a healthy, protected environment.


You should explain that death is natural. You can say, “All animals eventually pass away. The important thing is that we remember our loved ones, and we keep them in our hearts forever.”
If your child is very young, they may ask you what death is. It may be easiest to describe it by saying that the body stops working. You can say “Death is when you stop breathing, and your heart stops beating.”Younger children may not understand that death is permanent or final. You might tell them, “Death is natural, and it lasts forever. Max may not return to us, but that does not mean we have to forget him.” Over time, your child will come to understand death., Your child may have many questions about what death is or where their beloved dog went. Patiently answer these questions. Keep in mind that their questioning may not occur all at once; they may have many questions over a period of days.


If your child asks what will happen to the dog’s body, you can say, “We are going to have Max cremated. This means that his body will be turned into ashes. Don’t worry. He can’t feel pain anymore.” You can also say,“We’re going to bury Lulu in the backyard.” Avoid using words like “burn” or “fire.”If your child asks what happens to the dog after death, you can take the opportunity to explain any beliefs about the afterlife that you may hold. You can also say “I don’t know” if you're not sure about the afterlife. You can even state that although the dog is no longer with you, they will always live in your happy memories of them.If your child asks if they are going to die or if you are going to die, you can tell them, “It’s not likely to happen for a long time.”, What and how you tell your child can depend on their age, maturity, and relationship with the dog. Think about how much your child is capable of understanding and how they might react to the news.Young children may not understand what is going on, but they should still be told that the dog has died. Older children may be able to handle the news better, but they may also begin to act out as part of their grief.


If the dog was killed in an accident, you should be careful with what details you tell your children. Younger children may become scared or anxious if you tell them that the dog was hit by a car or attacked by another dog. Instead, you can say, “Sparky died today. It was very sudden.”
Older children may be able to handle the idea that their dog was killed in an accident, but you should only inform them about the cause of death, not any of the particular details. For example, you can say “There was an accident. Lulu was hit by a car, and unfortunately, she did not survive.” In this case you should emphasize that no one was at fault. You can say, “It was an accident. We’re not blaming anyone for it.”

Talk directly with your child's teacher about the allergy and any emergency plans.,
Talk to your child about allergy management at school.",How to Help a Child With Allergies Adjust to School Life," If your child will be in after school care, also tell the carers. Make sure that each person gets a copy of this letter or list. Include:


The allergy's common name and any scientific name
The allergy's severity level for your child
What can bring on an allergy attack in your child
Warning signs to be on the lookout for
What the person in charge needs to do in the event of an anaphylactic shock and the consequences of not responding
A list of contacts in an emergency (at least 3 people).;
, Ask your doctor if they mind the school contacting them for more information if needed, as this can help set the school carer's mind at rest.

, Label it clearly and put it somewhere safe. As an added precaution, give the school a back-up of the medication and be sure to replace the back-up if the use-by date expires during the school year.

, This will reassure both of you and will enable you to outline anything that is specific to your child's needs, including whether the teacher will need to ban certain food or items from the classroom.

, Check that she is aware of what needs to be done in the event of an attack and whether she can treat herself or needs to get the help of the teacher or someone else in charge.


Make sure your child knows how to use any special medication, such as an EpiPen if this is part of the plan.
Tell your child not to share food from other children's lunchboxes if she has a food allergy. Help your child to understand that this could leave her very sick, if she doesn't already understand this.

Ask them how they feel.,
Express your own grief.,
Share stories about your childhood pets.,
Play with your child.,
Allow your child grieve in their own way.",How to Help Kids Grieving the Death of Their Dog2," The child may not immediately express their emotions. Gently ask them how they are feeling. Encourage them to put their exact feelings into words, so that they can learn how to process their emotions.


You can say, “I know that this must be hard for you. How are you feeling? Can you tell me?”
Your child may state that they are sad or upset. You can respond by saying, “I’m sad too.”
It is normal for children to blame themselves for the dog’s death, even if they had nothing to do with it. They might also express resentment against you or the vet for not saving your dog.You might tell your child, “You had nothing to do with Skipper’s death. His body just stopped working. There is nothing that any of us could have done.”

, You should not feel as though you have to hold in all of your own grief. Showing your own reaction to death can demonstrate to your child that mourning is natural. It can also teach them how to grieve in a healthy manner.You can tell your child what emotions you feel. You could say, “I feel sad too. I’m going to miss Gigi so much. It makes me hurt inside too.”
Don’t be afraid to cry in front of your child. This can show them that crying is a normal reaction and that they should not be ashamed of crying after a loved one has died.
If your grief is making it difficult for you to complete daily tasks or if you cannot stop crying, you should find a confidante or consult a doctor., A good way to comfort your child is to tell them stories about your childhood pets. You might even include how you felt when they passed away. This will distract your child from their grief while teaching them that death is a normal part of life.Another option is to ask your child what their favorite story about their dog is. You can share yours as well.

, Children often work through their grief by playing. You can play with them to make sure that they are handling the loss of their dog well. As you play, you may notice that young children will incorporate death into their play. This is natural, and it is part of the grieving process for them. You might try to guide these plays towards a productive and healthy understanding of death.For example, if they are giving a doll a funeral, you might make sure that they understand what a funeral is.

, Some children may ask you a barrage of questions while others will sit in silence. Some will cry while others will want to play. These are all ways that children cope with death. Give your child room to grieve their own way. You should comfort them when they come to you in grief, but you should not force them to talk if they don’t want to. They may be dealing with the death in their own way.If your child wants space while they grieve, you should give it to them. They may not want to join in activities such as a funeral, memorial, or family discussions. Do not force them to participate unless they want to.

"
"
Hold a funeral.,
Ask them to create a memorial.,
Keep a normal routine.,
Wait before you get a new pet.",How to Help Kids Grieving the Death of Their Dog3," A funeral or memorial service will provide much-needed closure to the child. You can ask the child to help you plan the funeral. At the funeral, everyone can share their favorite story of the dog. The child can then help you spread the ashes or bury the remains.If you are religious, you can ask the child to help you write or find a prayer for the dog.
If you have multiple children, each should have their own part in the funeral. Perhaps one can bring flowers, one can sing a song, and one can carry the urn.

, Creative activities can help your child process emotions, and a pet memorial will give them something concrete to remember their dog by. There are many different types of memorials that your child can create for their dog.These include:


A scrapbook of all of their memories with their dog
A drawing of their dog that you can hang on their wall
A letter to their dog
A plaster paw print or bone with the dog’s name
A shadowbox filled with the dog’s pictures, toys, or collar
A story about the dog as written by the child

, The death of a beloved dog can be a major disruption in your child’s life. It is important during this time that they have a familiar routine and structure in the household. This will teach the children that life goes on despite death, and it will help them return to a sense of normalcy more quickly.This is probably not the best time to take a family vacation.
In most cases, you should probably not let a child miss school because they are grieving for the dog. If the child is inconsolable or traumatized, however, you might consider staying home with them for a day.
If you find that your own grief is too strong, you might ask a friend, spouse, or family member to help out with the children for a while so that you have your own space to grieve.

, A new dog will not replace the old one. Every dog has their own personality and characteristics, even if they are the same breed as your old dog. Give your entire family time to mourn your dog. Make sure that you do not rush into adopting a new dog until you are absolutely ready.Your children may start asking when you will get a new dog. You can say, “We will adopt a new dog in the future, but now is not the right time.”

Break the news gently.,
Spare the details.,
Don’t badmouth the parent.,
Avoid making excuses.,
Allow your child to talk.,
Say that it’s okay to cry.,
Show understanding.,
Address inconsistency with the parent.,
Handle the inconsistency with the child.,
See a child therapist.",How to Help a Child Cope with a No‐Show Parent," If your first reaction to the no-show is anger, don’t speak to the child right away. Gently and compassionately speak to the child and let them know that their parent is not coming. While it’s difficult for you to be the one to break the news, it is very difficult for children to try to understand why their parent would not want to come see them. Speak calmly and don’t let any of your anger come through.Consider the child’s feelings as you tell them, keeping the focus on the child and not the parent. For example, instead of saying, “Your parent decided not to show and cares more about themselves than you” say, “Your parent is not coming, and I’m sure it must be very disappointing for you to hear that.”
Sit down with the child and give your full attention. Say, “I know this is hard for you, but it doesn’t look like they are coming. We can talk about it if you’d like.”
With younger children, it might be more helpful to engage them in a fun activity as a distraction. For example, you could play a game with them, color with them, or ask them to help you bake some chocolate chip cookies.;
, If the child is struggling to understand why their parent is not coming, it’s often in their best interest not to go into details. Knowing the reasons may not help the child cope with their feelings of loss or sadness and may confuse them. Especially if you think the parent’s behavior is irresponsible (such as being involved in drugs or traveling from place to place), spare your child the details and keep your explanations simple and brief.Say what you know as concisely as possible. For example, say, “I just found out your parent is not coming, and they did not give a reason. I know this is hard to hear, and I’m sorry.”
If the parent is engaging in dangerous or reckless behavior, spare your curious child these details. However, if they ask why the parent did not show up, then you can offer an explanation. Keep your explanation vague. For example, “Your parent has some things happening in their life right now that sometimes prevent them from seeing you.”

, No matter how upset or angry you are, don’t say anything harmful about the parent in front of the child. Many children idolize their parents even when they are absent or inconsistent. A child may internalize the comments you make or think that something might be wrong with them for loving their parent. Take any anger or frustration out when the child is not present.When interacting with the child, make all your interactions about the child, not the parent. Focus on how the child feels and what the child thinks. Now is not the time for blame, anger, or harsh words.
Talk about how the parent loves the child. For example, say, “I know it’s hard to understand why your parent didn’t show. I don’t understand either, but I know they love you very much.”

, You might try to make up an excuse to lessen the blow of the parent’s behavior. No matter what, a child is hurt by a parent not showing and will likely feel like they are not a priority to their parent. Superhero stories may be exciting, but may ultimately lead to disappointment and distrust in you. Instead, talk about the people the child can count on such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.If the child does not ask for an explanation, don’t offer one. If they do ask for an explanation, then don’t tell a child that their parent is sick, as this may worry the child. Instead, say, “Your parent is having a tough time right now and they are trying to get better. When they do, someone will call you so that you can see them again.”You can also say something like, “Let’s think of all of the people in your life who you know love you. I can think of your brother, your sister, the dog, and your neighborhood friends. Who can you think of?”

, Validate the child’s experience by listening to them, allowing them time and space to react, and accepting their feelings. A child should know it’s okay to feel sad, upset, angry, frustrated, let down, or confused. Help them identify their emotions and express them in healthy ways. Let them know it’s okay to express these feelings and that you are listening.Help a child to identify feelings by saying, “I know this is upsetting” or, “I can tell you’re really sad and disappointed because you wanted to see your parent.”

, Some parents may instinctively say, “Oh honey, don’t cry” or, “You don’t need to cry,” yet, it’s important for children to express their emotions. Crying is one way that children can express themselves and feel relieved. Unlike hitting or becoming aggressive, tears can flush emotions in a safe and harmless way. If your child cries, let them know that it’s safe and okay to cry.Even if you feel uncomfortable, allow the child to cry and experience the sadness or grief they feel.

, If a child is frustrated and upset, let them know that you understand. Bypass the blame and instead model acceptance and understanding. Acknowledge the child’s feelings and the parent’s actions without judgment or finger pointing. When children get older, they want to know why their parent won’t come. Let the child know that they are loved, even when the parent doesn’t show. Say, “I am sorry that your parent is not here right now. I am here for you, if you would like to talk about it.""

, If you are the parent of the child, have a talk with the other parent. Taking care of a child has nothing to do with your past relationship and has everything to do with meeting the needs of your child. Ask them what happened and if there are problems that interfere with seeing your child. Are there logistical problems you need to address? Would a reminder be helpful? Remind yourself that it’s important to your child to have their parent in their life and be willing to make some accommodations.Create some boundaries or alternate arrangements to accommodate both of you. For example, find a meeting place that is neutral and convenient for both of you.
If the other parent is not showing consistency in showing up, ask what ways you can show help. Say, “I’ve noticed you’ve missed some time with our child, and I want to know if there’s anything I can do to make this easier for you or if there’s a way for us to simplify our arrangements.”

, Holding firm expectations for a parent to show up who has an inconsistent track record is going to lead to disappointment and anger. If a parent has shown inconsistency, take some action on your end to address this appropriately with your child. The cycle of anticipation and excitement followed by disappointment and anger can hurt a child significantly, so think about alternative options for your child. However, don’t use this as an opportunity to put down their parent by saying, “Let’s see if your parent comes this year” or, “Don’t get your hopes up because they rarely visit.”For a young child, let any visits be a happy surprise for your child. Instead of packing their bags and having them wait by the door or the window, let the visits be fun and exciting surprises for your child and not massive disappointments when there’s a no-show. Say, “Wow, look who came to visit! What a surprise! Let’s get you ready.”
For the older child, be casual by saying, “Your parent may come by later if they can make it.” By this point, they may recognize the inconsistency and learn not to count on their parent.

, A child who struggles intensely due to an inconsistent or no show parent may benefit from a therapist. A therapist can help the child talk about their feelings and put things in a way that the child can understand. A therapist can also help the child cope with the difficult emotions that arise from the absence of a parent in their life. A therapist can help a child see that expressing difficult emotions is okay and often very helpful.Some therapists specialize in seeing kids or families. Ask your physician or insurance provider for a referral to a child therapist. You can also search online or ask for a recommendation from friends and family.

Place the container somewhere suitable.,

Don't forget to take the tooth.,

",How to Have the Tooth Fairy Leave Signs of a Visit," You can decorate a tiny cardboard box or matchbox with stickers or colored paper. Make sure that you have some soft material or cotton batting inside to nestle the precious tooth in if you use a box.;
, Alternatively, get a book of wallpaper samples, any kind of fancy paper. Cut the paper into strips or shapes; you can fold it up later accordion style, or criss-cross, or origami. Hide this stash of paper, as your child must never see this paper. After all, it comes from the fairy realm!

, Choose something long and fanciful, like Lucinda or Lucien, Esmeralda or Eduardo. Practice writing teeny tiny notes in fanciful handwriting. A rollerball felt pen works best.

, ""Wow! You are getting soooo big and grown up!"" ""These teeth will be perfect for giving to (insert name of newborn relative or friend). ""This tooth is so perfect! It's just what we need for a new throne for Queen Dentica!"" Offer encouragement and joy to your child. Remember, it's coming from their best fairy friend.

, Try to find special coins with pictures (states, provinces, flowers, Olympics on them). Or use half dollars, or the magically gold-and-silver Canadian toonie, or pound coins. The shinier the coin, the better too. Try to leave something unusual.


If you must use bills or notes, fold them up. See how to make a dollar into an origami shirt.
Spend a little - there are only twenty teeth to ""pay"" for!

, If your child is a heavy sleeper, have them put the tooth in the container under their pillow - make sure you watch where it goes. If they are a light sleeper, suggest that they put the container on their night stand or window ledge.

, Write out your note, fold your paper, put it and the money into the container. Sprinkle a tiny amount of glitter on the night table or window ledge, make footprints using the very tip of your pinkie. Be sparing with the glitter - love fades, but glitter, as we know, is forever.

, Discard it if you must, but it's a better idea to store it in a secret place - maybe a box up high in the cupboards. It's a nice counterbalance for your child when they discover their secret fairy is just Mom or Dad to see a whole box of teeny-tiny teeth that you saved just for them. They can make art or jewelry or put them in their memory box to show their own children one day. And they will have a whole raft of notes to show those children.

Tell kids it’s OK if they want to hug in the future.",How to Help Kids Deal with Unwanted Hugs," Kids need to understand that their body belongs to them and they don’t need to touch others in a way that makes them uncomfortable. Emphasize to your children that they don’t have to hug others or let anyone hug them – even well-meaning relatives and family friends – unless they themselves want the hug to happen.You might tell your child something like, “It’s nice to hug people in our family, especially if we haven’t seen them in a long time. But if you don’t want to hug someone, that’s okay too. It’s up to you.”
Understand the difference between teaching kids to be polite and teaching them that they have to hug others. You can teach your children to be polite and respectful without giving them the message that they have to allow unwanted physical contact.;
, It’s important for kids to learn polite ways to greet people and depart from them. If they aren’t comfortable with hugging, there are plenty of other choices. Handshakes, high-fives, and fist bumps are a few good alternatives to hugging.Teach children to make eye contact and smile when greeting someone. This is a respectful and friendly way to acknowledge the other person while keeping the child’s personal boundaries intact.

, Speaking up for what they want comes naturally for some people, but a shyer child may have to be taught this skill. Assertiveness is the art of using your voice to state your own needs while still being respectful of others.You can help your child slowly develop assertiveness by practicing at home.


You might pretend, for example, that you are a family friend or relative who comes to visit. You go in for a hug, and give your child a default script to state their needs like ""Hi, Aunt Georgina. I'm not much of a hugger, but I love giving high-fives."" Then, have your child raise their hand to signal that they are prepared to give a high-five.
After practicing at home with you, your child should feel more confident and capable of speaking up about their needs in the presence of strangers.

, Sometimes, well-meaning relatives may insist on a hug or try to force a hug on a shy child. When this happens, stand up for your child and explain to the other person that your child prefers not to hug. Although it might seem a little uncomfortable or awkward, it’s important for your child to see you reaffirming their right to their personal space.Keep your explanation light and friendly if you can. Say something like, “It looks like Josh is feeling shy right now. Maybe he’ll be up for a hug later!” or “Sarah isn’t much of a hugger, but she loves giving high-fives!”

, If your child has a long-standing preference not to hug others and you know that someone, like a grandparent or other relative, will expect a hug when they see your child, try to explain your child’s preference to them before you see them. This can prevent awkwardness and hurt feelings later.Explain your reasons for not making your child give hugs. Try saying something like, “Mom, I know hugs mean a lot to you, but Emily is shy about hugging people, and we don’t make her give hugs if she doesn’t want to. We’re trying to teach her that she has a right to set boundaries for personal space.”

, Many children who dislike hugging don’t hesitate to show affection in other ways. Explain this ahead of time to relatives and family friends. This will let them know what to expect and give them ideas for how to interact with your child.For instance, your child might not want to hug his uncle, but might look forward to playing with toys together. Ahead of time, mention something like, “Sam had so much fun playing with Legos with you last month. He talks about it all the time. I know he’s really looking forward to showing you his new Lego set.”

, Sometimes children are shy around family members they don’t know very well yet. To help your child feel more comfortable, arrange play dates or skype sessions between your child and this relative. This will help them bond with each other, and it may even help your child feel more comfortable with hugging in the future., When you and your child encounter family members or friends at a gathering, help avert any awkward situations by asking your child, “Hug, handshake, or high-five?” This avoids hurting any feelings while letting the child choose the level of physical contact they’re comfortable with., Many times, spending time together is more meaningful than a hug. Encourage a shy child to play a card game with Grandma or make a craft project with their cousin. Spending time doing things together will make good memories for everyone and help your child feel more comfortable with people they’re still getting to know., A child who doesn’t feel comfortable hugging might prefer to draw their grandparents a picture or send them letters. Help kids find their own ways to show relatives they care about them and are thinking about them. , Sometimes kids feel shy about hugging someone they don’t know well, but warm up to hugs after they get to know the person better. Avoid pressuring kids, but let them know that Grandma and Grandpa would like it if the child wants to hug them someday. If and when the child does decide to hug, the gesture will be more genuine and meaningful."

Evaluate whether your toddler is ready to use a pillow.,
Select a pillow with firm and comfortable support.,
Determine which size is most appropriate for your toddler.,
Assess the content of the pillow.,
Purchase your toddler pillow.",How to Buy Pillows for Toddlers," Do not use pillows in cribs, where they can be a suffocation hazard. The best time to introduce your toddler to a pillow is when the child begins sleeping in a bed. Once a child's shoulders are wider than the head, the child usually will be more comfortable sleeping with a pillow.


Observe signs that your toddler is ready to use a pillow. The child may rest the head on a stuffed animal or blanket, or lay down on a pillow in an older sibling's room.;
, Press in the middle of the pillow to evaluate how quickly it regains its shape. If the pillow does not move (or moves only slightly) when you press it, it is too soft and unsafe for toddler use. If the pillow takes several minutes to regain its shape, it may be too firm and uncomfortable for your child.

,


Consider a toddler pillow. Several manufacturers offer pillows designed specifically for toddlers. Toddler pillows are smaller than standard pillows, with dimensions around 12 inches (30.5 cm) by 16 inches (40.6 cm) and a thickness of about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm). The smaller size eliminates the excess fabric that may be a suffocation hazard. The pillows also are firmer than typical adult sized pillows.
Select a standard-sized pillow if a toddler pillow is not available. A standard pillow, which is the most common size, measures 20 by 26 inches. Do not allow your toddler to sleep with more than one standard pillow at once. If your toddler sleeps in a double bed, remove extra pillows so there is only one pillow in the bed during sleep times.
Avoid king, queen and euro-sized pillows. Their large sizes make them unsafe for toddler use.

, Pillows can be filled with natural or synthetic materials.


Opt for 100% polyester non-allergenic Polyfill to avoid potential allergic reactions. Polyester, a synthetic fiber made up of three-dimensional clusters, is allergy and odor free. Polyester is more durable and holds it shape longer than natural fibers.
Choose 100% cotton filling for its soft fabric and breath ability. Cotton filling creates a flatter, firmer pillow that is ideal for toddlers. However, natural fabrics like cotton may cause allergy issues and are not as durable as synthetic fabrics.
Consider a pillow made of hypoallergenic foam. Sometimes referred to as posture pillows, foam pillows help to align the spine and neck to promote healthy posture while sleeping.
Avoid feather or down pillows because they are typically too soft and unsafe for toddler use. They also can contribute to allergies.

, Once you have evaluated the attributes best suited for your toddler's pillow, do some comparison-shopping. Toddler pillows and standard pillows are available at retail stores and online. Prices range from less than $10 to more than $80, depending on the style and filling you choose.

Measure the room and consider furniture placement.,
Pick a theme and color scheme.,
Order furniture in the second trimester.,
Purchase your crib first.",How to Buy Baby Furniture1," Use a tape measurer or a laser measurer and measure the size of your nursery. Pay specific attention to wall space – as most of your furniture will go along the wall. Think about where you will place:


Your crib. A standard crib is about 4 to 5 feet long (1.2 to 1.5 m).
A changing table. Changing tables can be between 3 and 5 feet (.9 to 1.5 m) long.
A rocking chair. You’ll probably need 3 to 4 feet (.9 to 1.2 m) of wall space for a rocking chair.;
, Before purchasing baby furniture, you’ll want to decide on a theme and color scheme. This is important, as you’ll want all the furniture to fit together into your plan for the room.If you decide on a certain color, like white, pink, or baby blue, you’ll likely want to purchase all your furniture in that color. You may want to consider purchasing a set so everything matches.

, Although it may be tempting to start ordering baby furniture very early on during your pregnancy, you should wait until the second trimester to do so. By waiting, you’ll be able to confirm the sex of the baby and make sure that your pregnancy is normal and healthy. Ultimately, three months should be more than enough to put your nursery together., If you’re buying pieces of furniture individually, purchase the crib first. Since the crib is the centerpiece of the entire nursery, you’ll want to match everything to it. Ultimately, your crib style will help you decide on many other items you’ll need for the nursery."

Bring everything to the baby room.,

Check the soundness of the crib.,
Slide the mattress into the crib.,
Attach the wheels if you wish.,
Check your crib weekly for loose bolts and sharp edges and ensure proper bedding.",How to Assemble a Crib," It is best to assemble the crib in the baby room so that you do not have to move the crib around once you have finished assembling it. They can be large and awkward to move around, and it may be difficult getting it through the door.;
, If it is new in a box it will come in several pieces. Everything you need to assemble the crib should be included in the box with the crib and you probably will not need any extra tools unless your particular instructions call for them.


If your crib does require tools then you might need a Phillips screwdriver, hammer and/or ratchet set. Read your instructions to find out which tools, if any, you need.

, If not, you will need to call the store and exchange the crib for a new one.


If for some reason you do not have the instructions then you can still check to make sure you have all the pieces. Most cribs will include a headboard, footboard, rails (the long sides of the crib; one rail is usually a drop rail, meaning that it can lower so that you can access your baby easily), some kind of mattress support (can be simply a board or can be a board with springs) and a mattress. It may also have two long thin side boards as support between the headboard and footboard, especially if both rails can move up and down (drop rails).

, Make sure that none of the pieces are damaged, for example showing splintered wood or peeling paint. This is especially true for secondhand cribs although you should also check the condition of new cribs to make sure they are safe for your baby.


If you see any damage such as splintering, mold, peeling paint, sharp corners or dampness then you will want to test your pieces carefully and perhaps obtain a new crib. Damaged pieces have the possibility of breaking, potentially harming your baby. You should also make sure that the spacing between the slats is no wider than 2 3/8 inches (6 cm)., Every crib has its own particular instructions that you should follow carefully. It is important to be attentive to these instructions because a mistake in assembling a crib could actually endanger the baby's life. Be thorough, and don't rush.


If you do not have instructions for your crib, perhaps if you lost them or are using a secondhand crib, often you will be able to find the manufacturer’s instructions online. Go the the website of the manufacturer and search for your crib model to try to obtain these.
If you still cannot find the instructions then it should not be hard to figure out how to assemble the crib. Since most cribs have the same basic pieces it shouldn't be difficult to figure out how to assemble the crib.

, Lay the headboard flat on the ground with the side facing inwards to the crib showing up. You can recognize this side by the holes for the brackets or dowels that will usually exist on the inward side.


Some beds show little difference between the headboard and footboard. Simply choose one of the pieces and lay that one on the ground facing up.

, These brackets will eventually attach the headboard and footboard to the mattress support so they must be facing the inside of the crib.


Some headboards might already have the latch brackets attached; if so move on to the next step.
Cribs that have long thin side boards (usually those with drop rails on each side) will attach differently. For these, insert the hardware of the side board into the headboard and footboard. If there is a location to screw these pieces together then you should do so.
For newborns you will want the base of the crib at the highest level so you would attach the brackets or side rails at this level. Older babies will need a lower crib base.

, Most stationary rails will have dowels on the ends. Slide the dowels into the latch brackets on the headboard and footboard on one side of the crib and screw them to the crib.


This attachment might require you to screw the rail in place. Using your Phillips screwdriver, screw the pieces together. They should be tight enough that the rail does not shake.
Sometimes your stationary rail will not have dowels but rather attach only by screws. In this case use your Phillips screwdriver to attach these screws to the rail. Again, this should be tight enough that the rail does not shake.
If your crib has side boards and two drop rails then you will not yet attach the rails. Skip to the next step.

, The mattress support will be a board, a panel (looks like a ladder) or springs in a frame, depending on your particular crib. This is what the mattress will be resting on so it is very important that this be secure. Slide it into the appropriate height and attach to the headboard and footboard using either screws, nuts and bolts or another type of fastener, depending on your particular crib.


If your crib is new you may need to attach some parts such as brackets to the mattress support before attaching it to the headboard and footboard.
For newborns attach the mattress support at the highest possible height. Older babies will need slightly more space and thus the mattress support should be placed lower, depending on the age of your baby.
There will usually be a manufacturer sticker showing which side faces down on the mattress support.
If you have a crib with two drop rails then you will attach the mattress support before attaching either of the sides. This way you can reach down into the crib more easily while attaching the support.

, Stand the drop rail onto the latch brackets on the headboard and footboard. Each side of the drop rail will have a metal rod, which is used for sliding the rail up and down. Insert the metal rods into the holes in the headboard and footboard and attach using screws (or another fastener depending on your model crib).


You should first attach the bottom of the rods on each side before attaching the tops to secure the rail and keep it steady while you are working.

, On the edge of your mattress support may be two loose springs. Pull them over a dowel and insert the dowel just above the bottom hole of the drop side rail. This will prevent your drop rail from falling all the way down to the floor if it is not secured properly.

, Shake the crib. It should not wobble when you try to shake it. The drop-side(s) should also be firmly attached, not loose, and be able to slide up and down. This is to ensure the safety of your baby.

, There will not be any hardware to go with the mattress; you can simply lower it into the base of the crib and let it rest there.


There should be no more than two fingers' width between crib side and mattress. This ensures your baby’s safety when moving or rolling around., Some cribs may have wheels on the bottom to make them easier to move around. Slide the wheels into the holes on the bottom of the four posts of the crib to secure them. Be certain they work properly both in movement and while locked.


There should be locks on at least two of the wheels to prevent the crib from moving around while your baby is inside.

, Keep your baby safe for as long as the crib is in use by checking that the bedding is not too hot, the crib is in good condition and that your baby is not too big. This will help keep your baby safe while using your baby crib.


Usually you would stop using the crib when the baby is 32-35 inches (81-89 cm) tall or climbing out of the crib.
If your baby is able to climb out of his/her crib, you can also lower the bottom portion to keep your baby safe.

Some people like a drop down rail so they can better reach their baby.
Some people like to have the option to convert the bed into a toddler bed (by basically opening up the front so a baby can crawl out).

, Then, look on the Internet or in books like ""Baby Bargains"" to evaluate whether the crib is of high quality. Things to think about are the wood, the craftsmanship, where it was made, what kind of paint is used on it, etc. Make sure you prioritize what is really important vs. what others think is important.

Purchase furniture that meets current safety standards.,
Avoid putting items into your crib.,
Use furniture designed for babies.",How to Buy Baby Furniture2," While it may be tempting to purchase used furniture to save money or antique furniture for its character, many older pieces of baby furniture don’t meet current safety standards. This is important, as old furniture may put your baby at risk of injury or even death.Slats on cribs shouldn’t be spaced more than 2 and 3/8 inches (60 mm) apart.
Use a changing table that has cabinets or drawers -- so potentially hazardous products will be out of reach of your baby.
Focus on furniture with round edges or purchase caps that cover sharp edges., While you may be tempted to pile pillows a variety of items in the crib to make it more comfortable, do not. To meet current safety standards, your crib should have nothing in it but a mattress and a tight sheet.

Don't use crib bumpers. The American Academy of Pediatrics warns that crib bumpers may cause sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
Do not allow your baby to sleep with a blanket or a pillow.
Avoid leaving toys in a baby's crib while they sleep., Although you may be handy around the house or like hand-made baby furniture, you need to make sure that all the furniture you purchase is specially designed for a nursery. This is important, as sharp edges and other features on furniture could pose safety hazards to your child."

Create a budget.,
Shop around.,
Look for sales and deals.,
Buy a dresser that can function as a changing table.",How to Buy Baby Furniture3," Before you begin to shop for baby furniture, you should put a budget together. Tally up the total amount of money you have for your nursery furniture. Once you do this, you’ll have a good idea of what type of items you can buy and what you can’t buy., The prices on baby furniture vary greatly. This depends on the quality of the item and where you buy it. As a result, before you pick anything you should determine the cost of items in your area. Consider:


Crib mattresses can range from $40 to $350.
Cribs may range from $110 to $800.
A changing table could cost you between $60 and $200.
Gliders and rockers could cost you between $100 and $800., After getting an idea of the cost of major items in your region, consider sales, coupons, and deals. These could dramatically decrease the cost of furniture you’ll need to buy. When hunting for deals:


Purchase remaining items that are on your baby registry. If you can wait until after the birth of your child, you might be able to score a 10% or greater discount on your remaining registry items.
Watch for nursery furniture sales at popular chains like Target, Babies ""R"" Us, and IKEA., A great way to save money is to buy a dresser that you can also use as a changing table. This way, you’ll save space, money, and won’t need to get rid of your changing table when your baby outgrows it. You’ll also have lots of storage space under your changing area."

Buy furniture that is made to last.,
Pick items that your child can grow into.,
Choose furniture that won't go out of style.",How to Buy Baby Furniture4," When picking baby furniture, choose pieces that are made of quality materials and are built to last. While this is important for safety, it is also important if you plan to use the furniture for another child or to pass it to someone else., There are many pieces of baby furniture you can buy that your child can continue to use at various stages of their lives. By thinking long-term, you’ll save yourself money and the trouble of purchasing new furniture later.

Buy a crib that converts into a toddler bed.
Purchase a changing table that can double as a dresser or bookshelf.
Find a dresser or chest of drawers that will be big enough to accommodate your child as a young adult., If you're planning to use some of your baby furniture for several years, pick items that will be just as appealing in five or ten years. When doing this, consider color, style, and finish.

Avoid adventurous styles. Instead, consider traditional furniture styles that have stood the test of time.
Focus on relatively neutral colors like white, grey, or stained wood. For example, while a bright pink dresser may seem cool for your baby girl, it may not work when your child is in elementary school.

Some people, most notably Richard Ferber (creator of ""the Ferber method), have advocated letting infants cry for increasing intervals to help them teach themselves to self-sooth. But this method has been very controversial, and when taken to extremes (with babies left to cry for extended periods of time) it can cause psychological stress and health problems in the child.
Other professionals have advocated methods of attachment parenting, such as co-sleeping, nursing to sleep, and rocking to sleep, which sometimes make it difficult for the mother to get any rest.;
, Tracy Hogg, author of ""Secrets of the Baby Whisperer,"" felt that letting babies cry themselves to sleep and providing too much attention at bedtime were both extremes that should be avoided. Her method is intended to be a moderate middle ground between extreme cry-it-out methods and extreme attachment parenting.The Baby Whisperer Sleep Method involves a strict day and nighttime routine for babies so that their bodies naturally adjust to bedtime at the right time. It also involves learning the baby's cues and how to communicate with the baby, so that the parent knows when the baby is tired.
The method must be adapted depending on the age of the baby. No sleep method at all should be used in the first three months of life, when the newborn sleeps excessively and does not participate much in play or interaction.

, method. The acronym represents the stages of a strictly structured routine, which is the basis of this sleep method.


E stands for Eat. When a baby first wakes up from a nap or bedtime, the first thing you should do feed the baby. Whether its a snack or a full blown meal (milk or solids, depending on the age), its important that this is the first step.A stands for Activities. After eating its time to play, run errands, or do any other activities that are not eating or sleeping. The amount of time spent doing activities will vary depending on the child's age, as very young infants cannot play for long without becoming tired, but older infants and toddlers can often go several hours.
S stands for Sleep. Its important that sleep directly follows activities, because the child has played until he or she begins to show signs of tiredness, and then transitions directly to sleeping without nursing or having a bottle. According to Hogg, bottles and nursing to sleep provide ""props"" that a baby relies on to fall asleep, preventing the baby from learning how to self-sooth.Y stands for You Time, and its what you get when you follow the rest of the routine.

, The EASY routine provides the structural framework in which the sleep method itself must exist, but perhaps the heart of the method itself is the philosophy behind pu/pd.


When a baby is placed in its bed for naptime or bedtime, she may quietly ""talk"" to herself, fall asleep, or cry. If she cries, the caregiver goes to her and picks her up, then practices a number of ""Four S"" techniques meant to sooth the baby. These include:

Set the stage: This involves the bedtime routine, and it should be the same for every sleep period and no longer than five minutes total. This is a winding down period that serves as a cue to the baby that it is now time to go to sleep. For example, you might change the baby's diaper, close the curtains, turn off the light, sing a certain song, and say a specific sleepy phrase (for example, ""time to go night night"").Swaddling: Not all babies like to be swaddled, but if yours does, this is one technique that can help sooth her to sleep.
Sitting quietly with the baby.
Shush-pat: This method works best for younger infants, and involves a firm pat in the center of the baby's back in the pattern of a heart beat (pat-pat, pat-pat) accompanied by a ""shhhh"" sound that is quite loud to distract the baby from its own crying.After the baby is calmed (but likely still awake), the caregiver puts her down into her crib and then leaves the room. The caregiver repeats this process (pick up, sooth, put down) as many times as needed to gently encourage sleep., The routine's elements-- eating, playing and sleeping, in that order-- are non-negotiable. But the length of each element will vary depending on your baby's needs.


Observe the time that your baby tends to naturally rise for the day. This will be the starting point of your daily routine.
Remember, Hogg calls it a ""routine"" and not a ""schedule"" for a reason. A schedule implies that you do things at the same time every day. A routine, however, implies the same order and structure, but not necessarily the same time or length of time for each element on the routine. You can be flexible with the routine by lengthening or shortening some of the elements throughout the day, but you must stick with the order consistently from day to day.

, This is the first step as soon as the baby wakes in the morning (you may need to change a diaper first). Its a logical first step because a baby who wakes from a long sleep period needs sustenance immediately.


At this age, you should feed the baby either breastmilk or formula only. Most babies 3-6 months old eat between 3-8 ounces of formula at each feeding.If your baby is breastfed, you won't know how many ounces, but you will feed your baby until she is no longer interested in actively nursing. As long as she is having regular wet and dirty diapers, and is gaining weight appropriately, you know she is getting the right amount of milk.
Generally, at this age feeding the baby will likely take around 30 minutes or so.

, After mealtime is finished, its time for activities to stimulate the baby prior to another period of sleep. Well rested now and with a dry diaper and a full stomach, your baby can focus on the important activities that help her motor, cognitive, and social skills to blossom.


The activities should vary and can consist of tummy time, looking at picture books, going for a walk outside, and other age-appropriate ways of stimulating the baby. The length of the play period will vary depending on your baby's attention span (which gets longer with age) and level of tiredness, and will most likely end with changing your baby's diaper.

, With a full tummy and a dry diaper, your baby should be ready for a nap. At 3 months, a baby will need 5 hours of sleep during the day and 10 hours at night.


Lay the baby down to sleep in her crib when she shows signs of tiredness. Follow a bedtime routine regardless of the time of day by keeping activity to a minimum and by providing peaceful surroundings.
Remain consistent with the sleep routine. The pattern of how to apply the Baby Whisperer's sleep method should be the same for naps as it is for nighttime.
If your baby cries, offer comfort. Begin with shushing sounds. If your baby remains fussy, gently pat her back to calm cries. If this isn't enough, pick her up but don't hold her longer than 2 or 3 minutes at a time. Put her all the way back down for the same amount of time and repeat the process until she is calm.

, Throughout the routine, your baby's cries, movements, noises, shouts or other vocalizations and body language are her way of speaking to you before she can talk. With time and practice, you will learn to decipher various behaviors and cries, which is a vital step in recognizing when she wants to eat, play, and sleep. Using this information, you should adjust the length of time that you spend at each of the stages of the routine (eat, play, and sleep).


Steady, rhythmic cries signify hunger. If you hear this sound during a sleep period, its time to feed the baby. Babies of this age do not typically sleep through the night without eating.
High-pitched, sudden cries along with jerky movements can indicate pain or discomfort. Rather than just offering comfort, you should check your baby to be sure no parts of the body are in pain or injured.
Tired babies may rub their eyes, yawn or blink. When you begin to see these signs during activity time, its time to transition to sleep time. Sometimes activity time will be shorter than others, depending on how tired your baby is from different amounts of stimulation., You will need to adjust for length-- some babies take a short morning nap and two longer afternoon naps, and some babies thrive on perfectly spaced naps of equal length.


Most babies at this age take three naps of about 5 hours and sleep a total of about 10 hours at night.It may take days or even weeks of utilizing the EASY method and the pu/pd sleep method before your baby adjusts and accepts the routine. According to the author of the method, it is vital that you follow through with the method, rather than giving up if your baby resists.However, you should always discuss any trouble with your baby's sleep or behavior with your pediatrician to ensure that there are no underlying problems like acid reflux or colic.

, While the elements of the routine stay the same (eat, play, sleep, in that order), the length of the elements and the strategies you might use will vary as your child becomes more aware, interactive, and alert during the day and more conscious of your absence at night.]


At 6 months old, most babies should not need a nighttime feeding, especially if he/she is eating solid food during the day.When your baby begins to sleep through the night, you can stretch the period of activity to 2 to 2.5 hours of playtime between naps. There will also be times when you may need to be flexible with the schedule, such as vacations or when you need to run errands that take longer than 2 hours.

, During nap or bedtime, babies of this age often ""talk"" to themselves or babble, or cry out of tiredness to help themselves fall asleep. Its important that you don't rush to her before she has had a chance to settle in for sleep. Listen to the sound of the cry.


The most common signal that she wants to be comforted is your child holding out her hands to you. When you pick her up, hold her in a horizontal position and say soothing words before placing her back in the crib.
If she gets more upset, walk away from her crib and avoid eye contact. You may be a distraction.

, At this age, your baby has become more aware of your absence and may benefit from an item that can help comfort and sooth her to sleep, such as a small, soft blanket or favorite sleep-safe toy.


If possible, try to use the same object at every nap and bedtime, and try to keep the toy or blanket in the bed only. This way, the baby will learn to associate the transitional item with sleep and not with playtime, and will be more likely to use it to sooth herself to sleep rather than playing in the bed.

, This means you will continue to increase the amount of playtime and activity, while reducing daytime naps. Always watch for your baby's signals so you will have a better understanding of what your child needs.


From around 8 months to a year, your child should still be taking 2 naps a day. Most babies only need one nap after a year, but you should know from your baby's tired signals and alertness while playing whether she is ready to eliminate one nap.
Naps may range from 20 minutes to several hours, depending on the baby. Continue to watch the baby's cues.

, Lay her down in the crib and walk away. Don't pick her up unless she gets very upset.


A baby monitor may be especially helpful at this stage. If you see that your baby has become so upset that she sits or stands, go into her room, pick her up and then lay her back down facing away from you.
If your baby isn't calming down on her own, leave her lying in her crib (rather than picking her up) and say comforting things. Babies of this age understand quite a bit of language, so you might use a soothing phrase like ""Mama's here. Its night time baby,"" which you can use consistently at every sleep time to help the baby adjust to sleep. You may place your hand on her back for a few minutes.

, She may be able to soothe herself.


Nighttime cries or calls are part of the normal sleep cycle, even for adults who often talk in their sleep. Since babies can't talk, they often grunt, moan, yell, or cry while still sleeping. If you go in and comfort the baby at this point, it will actually backfire by waking the baby more and disturbing the sleep cycle.If the cries escalate or seem unusual, go and comfort your baby.

Hold your baby and burp them.,
Lay your baby down and burp them.,
Lean your baby against your body.,
Feed your baby in a quiet, distraction-free room or area to cut down on their burps.,
Don’t be alarmed if your baby spits up as they burp.,
Put a clean cloth over your shoulder or chest as you burp your baby.,
Avoid forcing your baby to burp if they seem comfortable after feeding.,
Notice if your baby squirms or gets fussy while you feed them.,
Keep track of your baby’s burps after feeding.,
Remember that some infants may burp more often than others.",How to Burp a Sleeping Baby," This technique is good for babies who sleep on their stomach or who like to cuddle when they sleep.


Slowly move your baby next to your body so you do not wake them up.
Allow your baby’s head or chin to rest on your shoulder and cup their bottom to support them so they don’t slip as you hold them.
Place your other hand on their back and gently pat it to help them burp.
If your baby has developed control of their head and neck, you can try to hold your baby at a slight distance from your shoulder to burp them. Position your baby’s tummy near your shoulder and gently press their tummy using your shoulder. Make sure your baby is still breathing comfortably and cup their bottom with one hand while placing the other hand on their back. Continue to gently press their tummy with your shoulder until they burp.;
, This method is great if you are already lying next to your baby and feeding them, as all you need to do is pull your baby close and prop their head and tummy against your lap.Place your baby on your lap, perpendicular to your body.
Put their tummy on your leg and gently apply pressure to your baby’s tummy with your leg. Make sure your baby’s body is even across your legs so blood does not rush to their head.
Tilt your baby’s head to one side so they can breathe properly even when they are lying on their tummy.
Use your hand to support their head by placing your thumb and index finger on their jaw or chin, just below their ear. Do not place your hand against their neck or near their throat as you don’t want to choke your baby or constrict their breathing.
Wait until your baby burps.

, This technique works best for babies who like to sleep on their stomach and for heavy sleepers, as it can be difficult to get your baby into position without waking them up.


First, lean back slightly against a comfortable chair or couch forming a 130 degrees angle. You can also use several pillows on your bed to elevate yourself instead of sitting on a chair or couch.
Slowly lean your baby up against your body. Have them face down. Their head should be on your chest and their stomach should be against your stomach.
Support their bottom with your hand and place your other hand on their back to gently pat them.
Continue lightly patting your baby's back until they burp.

, Most babies are more likely to swallow air when they are distracted by loud noises or voices during feeding, which can cause them to become gassier and need to burp more often.

, This is a common part of burping and occurs because the air in your baby’s stomach is usually trapped in the milk they just ate, so when the air comes out, the milk comes along with it. You may notice that milk also comes out of your baby’s nose. Spit up from the mouth and nose is a normal thing for many babies to do as they burp so don’t worry if this happens.


Spit up can also be caused by reflux. Reflux occurs when milk and gastric juices flow back up from the baby’s tummy and come out of their mouth, resulting in the baby spitting up. If your baby keeps spitting up a large amount of milk, you may want to try the upright position of burping by holding your baby or leaning your baby to avoid milk from flowing back to their mouth.
Your baby should outgrow spitting up when they reach 12 to 24 months of age.

, This will help you avoid getting the baby’s spit-up on your clothes. You can also use the clean cloth to wipe your baby’s mouth and nose as you burp them.

, It’s okay if your baby does not burp after every feeding, as long as they appear comfortable and not gassy. Your Baby may burp during their next feeding or burp more, which is fine.


Always pat your baby gently on their back as your burp them as a hard or sharp pat does not encourage your baby to burp any faster or easier.

, Because most babies can’t just tell you when they need to burp, it’s important to pick up on your baby’s body language to recognize when they are gassy and need to burp. Most babies who need to be burped are typically squirmy during their feeding and get fussy, and visibly uncomfortable.Burping is essential for infants as they need to let go of the gas in their bodies due to drinking milk. So, it is especially important to encourage them to burp when they fall asleep during their feeding.
Most babies burp on their own at around two months oldand outgrow burping by around four to six months old, so you don’t need to worry about burping them after that point., Notice how frequently they need to be burped after each feeding. If your baby doesn’t burp much during they day, chances are you don’t need to worry about burping them at night.


Most babies who eat at night don’t need to be burped because they nurse less anxiously at night and as a result, suck in less air., This could be because of the way they are being fed, as bottle fed infants usually swallow more air than those that breastfed, and will have more gas.


In general, most breastfed babies need to be burped when you switch breasts and when the feeding is complete.Bottle fed babies should generally be burped every two to three ounces of milk they drink.If you are bottle feeding your baby, look for specialist feeding bottles that eliminate air during feeding, thereby lessening the amount of air being trapped inside your baby’s tummy.

Wait.,
Slowly introduce a pacifier to see how your baby reacts.,
If baby responds positively to the pacifier, go ahead and skip to the next step, otherwise, if baby seems uninterested or dislikes the pacifier, try these suggestions:


First, if your baby starts to take the pacifier but then spits it out, try gently tugging on it when it is in your baby's mouth.,
Now that baby is interested in the pacifier, keep a pacifier handy and offer it each and every time your baby starts to go for his/her thumb or hands.",How to Get a Baby to Take a Pacifier Instead of Thumb Sucking," If you intend to breastfeed, consider waiting until your baby has gotten used to breast feeding in order to prevent nipple confusion. (For some babies nipple confusion does not occur, so a pacifier can be introduced right away.) Until the pacifier is introduced gently push the baby's hands away from his/her mouth whenever he/she seems likely to want to suck on them. If hunger seems to be the reason for sucking hands, feeding time can be a good way to prevent sucking. It may also help to use baby mittens or baby outfits with sleeves that can be folded over your baby's hands to cover them.;
, A wonderful time to introduce a pacifier is when he/she is about to fall asleep while eating. This is because you will have three things working for you: the baby is in a good mood, he/she still feels like sucking, and he/she is sleepy and therefore easily movable and receptive.


Be careful to avoid doing anything that would make it a bad first experience. Try to avoid forcing an uninterested, hungry, or irritable baby to take the pacifier, because this could make baby angry, thus making baby dislike the pacifier. Also try to avoid pushing the pacifier in too quickly, or at a slightly wrong angle, because this could gag your baby, also making baby dislike the pacifier. (If you have already accidentally done something to make baby hate the pacifier, no worries – you can still do this!)

, This triggers the baby's reflex to suck it back in. Be careful not to accidentally push on it while it is in your baby's mouth, because that triggers an opposite reflex causing your baby to spit it out.
If this trick does not get your baby to take the pacifier, try giving your baby the pacifier later when your baby is in a different mood. Do this a few times to try to find the best mood to introduce it.
If that still does not work, consider testing out pacifiers of a different size or shape. For some babies (especially newborns) the standard pacifier has a nipple that is too large and can make them gag. There are special newborn and premature size pacifiers that may work better.
If all else fails, as a last resort put something sweet on the pacifier, such as fruit preserves or sugar water. Sure, this is not preferable, but realistically some babies just refuse to take a pacifier until it is introduced this way. Keep gently introducing the pacifier until baby shows an interest in sucking on it. (This may take as long as a week or two. Don't give up! If you stick to it, it will happen eventually.)

, It may be helpful to buy a pacifier clip to attach the pacifier to the baby's clothes. (It is best to choose one with a short strap so that strangulation is not a risk.) Alternatively, you could always carry a pacifier with you in your pocket, diaper bag, or clipped to your clothes.


Another option is to buy lots of pacifiers and keep one in each place that you might set the baby to rest (for example, one by the crib, one by the baby swing, one in the car glove compartment for car trips).

Expect the motion to assist you.",How to Manage a Baby's Sleep Needs when Travelling1," If your baby is like most babies and tends to be lulled to sleep with motion, then they will doze on and off during any journey. Of course, if you have travelled during the day, this excessive sleep can affect their ability to settle down and sleep at night, once you have reached your destination. Settling can be further affected by the fact that the sleeping environment will be different to home.


There are two possible solutions to this challenge:

Travel during the night.
Put your baby to bed much later than usual, and only do so when you see signs of tiredness.

;
"
"
Plan in advance.,
Prepare for the flight.,
If necessary, take an infant painkiller with you.,
Try apple rings.,
Dress your baby in a simple one piece soft suit with popper fastenings and take two or three more with you for the journey.

,
Have a good baby bag in tow.,
Check in as early as you can, and don't be afraid to ask if there are any spare seats.

,
As soon as you can after take off, offer your baby a drink.,
Allow your baby to sleep as much as they like on the plane.,
Keep your baby entertained.",How to Manage a Baby's Sleep Needs when Travelling2," If you are intending to travel by plane or if you are going to a country which has a significant time difference, it is worth planning ahead, so that you can minimize any disruption to your baby's, and your, sleep.

, In preparation for the flight, if possible:


Reserve a bassinet, or find out the policy on taking baby car seats on board.

, Fresh unopened sachets are easier to use and pre-measured for convenience. It's wise to get a doctor's note giving you permission to take it on the plane.

, If your baby is old enough (4 months plus) buy some dried organic apple rings. Hook one onto their thumb which will prevent boredom by allowing sucking and chewing. This will also help with ear pressure changes. Alternatively, use a dummy or pacifier.

,, A light, roomy bag with lots of compartments will help you feel organized and in control.

,, This will help to ease the pressure in their ears, as well as preventing dehydration.

, Regardless of the time difference, feed at the usual times as far as possible. If you need a bottle to be warmed, ask well in advance.

, When awake, walking up and down will help, also, pointing out things in a suitable in-flight film and allowing them to play with a few safe objects. Don't bother packing too many toys though; your baby will soon get bored with them!

"
"
Allow for familiarization time.,
Try to go to bed at the same time as your baby.",How to Manage a Baby's Sleep Needs when Travelling3," Once at your destination, if awake, allow time for your baby to familiarise themselves with the new surroundings. Do not allow another (especially unfamiliar) family member to put them to bed on her first night – no matter how tempting that might be.

, If you are travelling with your partner, it is a good idea to organize yourselves into shifts to deal with the night, or very early morning waking, which is so common when you change time zones.

"
"
When your baby is in an unfamiliar place, you can help them to feel safe and secure by following the same bedtime routine as you do at home.

,
Sing the same night time songs and keep to your familiar bedtime stories.

,
Don't forget to bring along a favourite toy – especially one that your baby associates with sleep.

",How to Manage a Baby's Sleep Needs when Travelling4,",,"
"
Start early!,
Allow for sleeping in.,
Remember that babies are far more flexible than adults when it comes to adjusting to a different time zone.",How to Manage a Baby's Sleep Needs when Travelling5," If necessary, one of you should get up and start the day much earlier than usual with your baby as they begin to adjust to the time difference. This is better than bringing them into your bed. Remember that if your baby's sleep is disturbed, the chances are that yours will be too!

, On the following day, allow plenty of sleeping during the early part of the day, this nap may be far longer than usual. Then restrict afternoon napping and put them to bed closer to local “bedtime”.

, Try following your baby's lead and soon you will all have adapted to the time change.

Buy a new crib.,
Choose a crib with breathable sides.,
Check for a firm mattress.. A firm mattress is vital to an infant's wellbeing.,
Avoid drop sides.,
Examine a crib for damage prior to purchase.,
Make sure a crib has not been recalled.,
Think about how the crib will be used.,
Consider how much you will move the crib.,
Weigh in the frequency of your trips.,
Opt for more natural materials.,
Consider a cloth or wool mattress pad.,
Look into waterproof pads.,
Check for latex cushioning.,
Look at weight and size.,
Consider how long a crib takes to clean.,
Find a crib that's easy to assemble.",How to Buy a Safe Portable Crib," Older cribs may not meet modern safety standards, which are important to your baby's well being. Always opt to buy a new crib when searching for a portable crib.Older cribs may also be worn down. Things like loose screws could harm your baby. When looking at cribs, check the box for the production date.
A new crib does not necessarily mean the crib is safe. You should look into other factors when considering safety.;
, At least three of the crib's sides should be made of mesh fabric. Preferably, all four sides should have mesh fabric. This assures that the crib has proper ventilation, keeping your baby safe.If the crib has slats, make sure they are no more than 2 3⁄8 inches (6.0 cm) apart (about the width of a can of soda).This is a mandatory standard, but it's good to check.

, If a mattress is too soft, a baby could suffocate. When looking at cribs, opt for a firm mattress.If there is a mattress pad, there should be very little space between the mattress pad and the mattress. A baby could roll into this gap and suffocate.
Stay away from soft and cushy bedding. This can increase the risk of your baby suffocating.
Make sure to buy sheets that fit your mattress properly; portable crib mattresses may be smaller than regular crib mattresses.

, Drop sides are a special means to make it easier to remove your baby from the crib. These sides drop down when you need to get your baby out; however, they can be dangerous. Drop sides have been linked to 32 deaths over the past decade. Stationary sides, while less convenient, are far safer for your baby., Even new cribs can come with some damage. You should always carefully inspect a crib prior to purchase. You do not want to buy a crib that is falling apart.If you buy a painted crib, check the paint. Paint should not be flaky or peeling.
Any decorations, like ribbons or bows, should be removed.
Make sure there are no cracks, splinters, and rough edges on the crib.

, Do a quick online search on the brand and type of crib you're purchasing. This should indicate whether a recall has been issued for that crib recently. You should never purchase a crib that has been recalled by the company, as it probably comes with a number of safety risks., If you just need a crib for sleeping and short play sessions, there's no need to get a crib with a lot of special features; however, if you plan to use the crib often, you may want to look into a pricier model. Things like a bassinet and a diaper changing station may be helpful if you'll be using your crib a lot., If the crib will be moved a lot, you'll want to know how wide it is before purchase. You want to make sure it does not have to be disassembled to be moved from room to room.Some cribs also have wheels. If you're going to move your crib a lot, a crib with wheels may be a good option for you.

, If you travel all the time, you will want a lightweight crib. Some portable cribs are quite heavy and require a lot of assembly.Look into a crib that's less than 30 pounds if you travel a lot. You should also select a crib with relatively easy assembly.
Most portable cribs come with a carrying case or bag with straps to help carry them comfortably.
If you do not travel a lot, a sturdier, heavier crib may be okay. If you only have to set up the crib once or twice a year, ease of assembly and weight may not be as big of an issue.

, More natural materials tend to use less chemicals than synthetic fabrics and foams. Certain chemicals may irritate your baby.Read the material label on a crib. Look for a crib without a long list of materials, especially chemical materials.
Flame retardants can potentially be dangerous for a baby. Opt for a crib that does not use flame retardants.

, There are many different mattress pad options. A cloth or wool cover may be right for you if you're looking for a more organic option. 100% cloth covers use less chemicals than vinyl or synthetic covers.One major downside to cloth pads is they're more difficult to keep clean. Babies are messy, and diaper leaks will soak into a cloth cover easily.
Wool pads may be easier to wash than cloth covers.

, You can often find pads that contain organic ingredients but also some waterproof materials. Waterproof pads contain an ingredient called polyurethane. Check the materials list for this ingredient.If you're worried about chemicals, look for a waterproof pad that is labeled as lead and phthalate free.

, Some mattresses contain latex cushioning. While this may not prove a problem for many babies, some babies have a latex allergy. If your baby has a latex allergy or has a medical condition that puts them at risk for latex allergy, look for a mattress with non-latex cushioning., You want to make sure you pick a weight and size that meets your needs. Portable cribs can range greatly in weight and size.A smaller, lightweight crib is great if you're looking for something to take on trips. Look for a minimalist design, and a crib that weighs around 12 to 15 pounds.
If you're placing a crib in a second location permanently, like your parents' home, opt for a heavier, sturdier crib.

, You will end up washing your crib a lot, so make sure a crib is fairly easy to clean. Look for a crib that has more machine washable parts. It can help to read reviews online. Some consumers may report how long it took to clean the crib., Most cribs include some details in the description about assembly. It can help to look up assembly instructions online when selecting a crib. Look for a crib that comes with fairly simple instructions, especially if you'll be traveling a lot with your crib."
"
Begin the routine before you move baby to crib.,
Include a snack.Try giving your baby 2 or 3 oz (60 or 90 ml) of formula or breast milk before going to bed.,
Give baby a bath.,
Read a book.,
Sing a soothing song.,
Give baby a bedtime toy.",How to Get a Baby to Sleep in a Crib1," Several weeks before attempting to move your baby into his or her crib, introduce set cues and habits that will let your baby know when bedtime has come.


A set routine will help your baby know that it's bedtime, regardless of where he or she is sleeping.
You can vary the routine as desired, making it as short or long as you need in order to help baby wind down. The elements you introduce into your routine should all be of a calming nature, however.
Beginning the process before moving your baby to his or her crib will help your baby to associate the new routine with bedtime. As a result, your baby will still know that it's time for sleep even when one aspect of the routine—sleeping in your room—ceases.
Be consistent. The only way to establish certain actions as a routine is to do them every night. If you skip some nights, you might give your baby mixed signals.
Even if you have no pre-set cues that tell your baby when it's time to go to sleep, there might be signs and signals you unknowingly give to your baby that indicate the arrival of bedtime. Analyze your bedtime habits and determine if there are any habits you have established for your child. If there are, continue these habits as much as possible.;
, For babies over six months of age, you could also try giving them 1 or 2 Tbsp (15 or 30 ml) of cereal before bed.


Stuffing your baby with too much food will only cause discomfort, but giving him or her a little before bed may help your baby feel more comfortable and last a little longer into the night before waking up.







, A short, warm bath can help soothe your baby, easing him or her into sleep.


Note, however, that some babies will feel invigorated when given a bath. If yours falls under this category, then you should do the bath earlier in the day rather than making it part of your bedtime routine.
Follow the bath by wrapping your baby in a warm towel or blanket. Holding your child close will also add an extra level of warmth and comfort, further soothing your baby in preparation for sleep.







, Choose a simple book designed for babies and read it in a calm, gentle voice.


Even though younger babies may not understand the story as you read it, your baby can still appreciate the routine of being held while mom or dad speaks in a calm, rhythmic voice. Additionally, the rhythmic, sing-song quality of the text found in most children's books can have a soothing quality in itself.
Consider selecting a children's book themed around sleep. Once your child grows old enough to understand the story, the routine may have an even stronger effect.
If your baby has not relaxed after a single book, you can also consider reading several books before bedtime. Do not allow this part of the routine to last past 5 or 10 minutes, though, since it may actually cause your baby to feel more awake if it continues too long.

, Lullabies exist for a reason. Singing a gentle lullaby or similarly calming song might help your baby wind down, and the rhythmic quality of music makes it a great aspect to introduce into a bedtime routine.


Singing to your baby while holding him or her against your chest allows the child to feel the soothing vibrations of your voice as they listen. This may help maximize the calming quality of the song.
When the time comes for you to move your baby into the crib, sing the lullaby while still holding him or her. After a week or so passes, change this practice so that your baby is already in his or her crib when you begin the song.

, Choose a simple toy, like a stuffed animal, that can act as a symbol of security.


Avoid stimulating toys designed to help babies develop. While these toys are great for daytime play, placing them in the crib at night might prove too stimulating for your baby and may keep him or her awake.
You could also try a toy specifically designed for bedtime. For instance, stuffed animals that play soothing music are a popular choice.
Security blankets often have the same effect and may be used in place of a toy.
For younger babies who have not established independent head control, you should position the toy far enough away so that it can be seen but not grabbed. Doing so will prevent your baby from accidentally rolling into it and suffocating.

Give yourself time and freedom.,
Consider childproofing needs throughout the design and assembling process.,
Consider your budget.,
Measure the room and write the measurements on a small card you can carry in your wallet.,
Plan the layout.,
Choose the near-bedtime lighting.,
Choose some flooring.,
Work out a color scheme.,
Select a baby crib.,
Find baby nursery furniture to complement your crib.,
Hang decorations.",How to Design a Baby Nursery," If it's possible, try to plan well before the birth. This luxury isn't open to every new parent but if you do have time, starting early can ease your concerns about having too much to do. In terms of freedom, realize that there is no one right way to design a nursery other than ensuring that it is safe, warm and healthy. Decorative elements are completely up to you and you can have as much or as little in the nursery as you wish.

While it's fun to use sites like Pinterest to create a dreamboard nursery, be realistic. Time, financial and space constraints will end up dictating a lot of what you're able to do in the end; use your photos as general inspiration rather than absolute must-haves.;
, This is the primary concern and the one thing on which you cannot compromise.

, It's easy to want the best for the baby, and for some parents that may include providing a beautiful, new, well-coordinated nursery, but remember that it won't matter to the baby whether the area rug matches with the curtains. Stains are a fact of life, so focus on buying things that are functional first, beautiful second. When the baby spits up and has accidents, you want to focus on the child, not on how those sheets you spent so much money on are ruined.

Bear in mind that baby is only a baby for a short space of time. It may not feel like it now, but over-blowing the budget on baby gear and gadgets isn't really the best idea. Save your pennies for the growing child, who will cost you considerably more than baby. In this same vein, do not be ashamed to accept heirlooms and hand-me-downs. For example, a crib that gets passed around the family is great, provided it has been checked for safety prior to each use.

, You will need these measurements when you go shopping for furniture, paint, etc. And if you happen to see something nice at a flea market you did not expect to visit, you can reach into your pocket for the measurement information.

,
Consider putting the crib close to the entrance so that you don't have to walk around things or risk tripping over something when you come for the baby in the middle of the night. Avoid putting the crib right next to the window, where there might be drafts. Never place a crib near anything that dangles, like curtain or blind trimmings, as the baby can get caught up in these and choke.






Put the changing table close to the crib. When the baby has wet accidents, you don't want to carry him or her across the room.






If there is a window, think about putting the rocking chair or glider next to it so you can look outside. You could also get yourself a nice comfortable rocking recliner. By this window, make sure to get some contrasting curtains that go with the wall color to protect the baby from any bright light. Add a block out blind to help your baby sleep well during the day if the sun shines directly into the window.






Estimate how much storage you'll need, and create twice as much. The baby will accumulate more items than you may think. Do not place any shelving above the crib, where either the shelving or the things on the shelves might jostle and fall onto the baby.







, It may be a good idea to switch off all lights in the room once the baby has been put in the crib, due to recent studies. (See link at bottom.) A dimmer switch, sconce, chandelier or nightlight - they are all among your options. Choose more than one if you like. Make sure you run any necessary wiring now before you start painting.

, Do you want it to match the rest of your home? Do you or your spouse have a history of allergies? If so, your baby might be susceptible too. Take this into account when you make your choice. Wall to wall carpet can harbor allergens, so a hardwood floor with a removable rug (which can be cleaned) might be your best bet.

, This will be influenced by your nursery theme if you have chosen one. If you don't know the baby's gender, favor neutral colors like cream, yellow, beige, and pale green. Decide also whether or not you would like to decorate with a nursery theme. Anything goes, from cowboys to flowers, pirates to butterflies, or something more modern, such as blocks or stripes. Also consider how the room will be used in the future. Will you need to repaint the room once the child outgrows the theme?

, The crib will form the focal point of your baby nursery. Take your time and choose wisely. Shape, style, finish and durability are among the factors you should consider. Be sure the slats of the crib are vertical, so the baby will be less likely to use the slats for climbing out. And be sure the slats are close enough together as not to allow the baby to get his or her head stuck. An easy guideline for this measurement: if a standard size soda can fits through the slats, they are too far apart. Newer models will incorporate both of these features, but if you using an old crib, you have to think about these things.

, Essential furniture items include: a baby changing table; a very comfortable chair; a night stand or table, a nursery hamper and a clock if you are planning to breastfeed. Important safety note: Except for the chair, it is very important to secure all furniture to the wall. Your child will be old enough to pull down on an open drawer faster than you think. It is best to secure everything when you put it in the room. You can do this either with a strong nylon strap or an L bracket. First find a stud in the wall behind the piece of furniture. You can do this by taping with a hammer or by using an inexpensive stud finder. Chose a position on the upper side or top of the furniture where you can secure the strap or bracket to the stud.

, It's time for that great baby nursery shopping spree you've been waiting for. Choose a mural, picture, and bedding. Buy stuff, sew stuff, glue stuff. Assemble the furniture in the nursery, if possible, so you don't have any issues with large items not fitting through the doorway. Let the room come alive. Remember to add essential equipment to your baby nursery:

Change the baby’s diaper.,
Feed the baby.,
Give the baby a massage.,
Soothe any teething pain.,
Dress the baby in comfortable clothing.,
Check for rashes.,
Make sure the baby’s not sick.",How to Get a Baby to Sleep1," A baby may have a hard time getting to sleep if he/she has a wet or soiled diaper. Once he's/she’s got a dry diaper on, he'll/she’ll feel cozier and will be able to sleep better.;
, Give the baby one more feeding to tank up his/her tummy before he/she goes to sleep. Don’t feed him/her too much though. If he's/she’s eaten too much, he/she might be uncomfortable and have a harder time getting to sleep.

, Relax your baby by rubbing his/her body. Sit with the baby on the floor. Place him/her on his/her tummy and gently rub his/her feet, legs, back, arms and head. Then place him/her on his/her back and rub her chest, tummy and the fronts of his/her legs and arms. Sing or talk softly with your baby while you give him/her a massage.
Use a fragrance-free baby oil if you want.
Wait about 45 minutes after feeding your baby before giving a massage. You might upset his/her stomach with any pressure on her body., Oftentimes babies have trouble sleeping when they have new teeth coming in. If you suspect that your baby is getting a new tooth, give him/her a teething ring to gnaw on before bed.If the teething pain is bad, give him/her a dose of Infant Tylenol. Be sure to follow the dosing instructions on the bottle.

, If the baby’s pajamas are itchy or otherwise uncomfortable, he/she might not be able to relax enough to sleep well. Make sure your baby is wearing something cozy and comfortable. An outfit made of 100% cotton is a good choice., Babies are often troubled by a diaper rash or a heat rash. Check his/her diaper area to make sure he/she does not have any uncomfortable red areas.

Make the crib a pleasant place.,
Establish that the crib is a place for sleep during the day.,
Ease baby into sleeping in the crib at night.,
Move the crib into your room.,
Sleep in baby's room.,
Coax baby to sleep before leaving.",How to Get a Baby to Sleep in a Crib2," During the day, put toys in your baby's crib for him or her to reach for.Do this during play time, not nap time.
Place the toys in the crib and encourage your baby to reach for them through the bars. After some time passes, place your baby in the crib to grab the toys.
By placing toys in the crib, you establish it as a safe, ""fun"" environment.
Do not let your baby play for too long in the crib, though. Your child needs to see the crib as a pleasant place, but you should not establish it as a place for play and activity.

, Once your baby gets over his or her anxiety toward the crib, start holding nap time in the crib.


This can be done gradually. For instance, if your baby takes two naps, you can let your baby take one nap wherever he or she usually sleeps. Place your baby in the crib for the other nap, though. Once your baby becomes comfortable sleeping in the crib for one nap, put him or her in the crib for both.
Being left alone in the dark could be a major cause for your baby's fear. As such, letting your baby adjust to the crib during the day, when he or she can see more, can greatly reduce initial crib anxiety.

, After your baby feels comfortable sleeping in the crib for naps, you can start placing your child in the crib at night.


In some cases, you might be able to simply leave your baby alone in the crib as you would for a nap. He or she may fuss at first, but after several minutes, your baby might fall asleep without much difficulty.
If your baby still exhibits signs of crib anxiety, you might need to take additional steps to introduce your baby to the idea of sleeping in the crib at night.

, Place the crib next to your bed so that your baby can still see you as he or she falls asleep.


If your baby is used to sleeping in your room, the scariest part about transitioning to the crib might be the change in surroundings. By moving the crib into your room for several weeks, you allow your baby time to adjust to the crib in an otherwise comfortable setting.
Your baby may still have trouble adjusting to the crib if it is placed on the far side of your room. If this happens, you may need to compromise further by positioning the crib directly next to your bed. Once your baby becomes comfortable sleeping next to you in the crib, gradually move the crib further and further away within the room.
When you baby is comfortable sleeping in the crib in your room, and has been so for roughly a week, it is time to move the crib back into baby's room.

, If your baby has trouble sleeping in his or her crib once you move it into baby's room, spend a few nights sleeping on a cot or sleeping bag in the same room.


Your presence can have a very soothing effect on your baby, which can turn an unfamiliar, uncomfortable set of surroundings into a safe place. By spending a few nights in your baby's room as he or she falls asleep, you can help to establish that room as a safe place.
Once your baby has comfortably fallen asleep in your presence for three or four nights, you can ween yourself away.

, Instead of spending the night in baby's room, only stay put while your baby falls asleep.


If necessary, pat or massage your baby's back while cooing or humming softly to make your presence known.
Begin by sitting nearby, making it easy for baby to see you. When your baby feels comfortable with the distance, move your chair back a little further. Each time your baby adjusts to the change in distance, move back a little more until, eventually, you are out of sight.
When your baby is comfortable falling asleep without seeing you, you can start leaving the room and letting him or her fall asleep alone.

"
"
Stop rocking baby to sleep.,
Use a bassinet.,
Let baby nap where he or she is comfortable.,
Introduce baby to crib during the day.,
Give baby time to adjust to sleeping alone at night.",How to Get a Baby to Sleep in a Crib3," If you coax your baby to sleep by rocking him or her, gradually stop the practice so that your baby learns to fall asleep without human contact.


When weening your baby from this practice, rock him or her until your child starts relaxing but is not quite asleep. Your baby might protest after you stop, but if your baby feels relaxed enough, these protests should not last long before he or she drifts off.
Gradually decrease the amount of time you spend rocking your baby until, eventually, your baby is able to fall asleep simply by being held and not by being rocked.
After your baby adjusts to falling asleep without being rocked, you can transition him or her to falling asleep without being held.

, If your baby sleeps in your bed, graduate him or her to a separate bassinet or small cradle placed directly next to your bed.


Your baby might feel more comfortable with the concept of not being able to cling to you at night if he or she can at least see you. After your baby has adjusted to sleeping separately and has done so for several weeks, you can consider moving your baby out of the room completely.

, Instead of holding your baby during nap time, let your baby fall asleep wherever he or she can get comfortable.


Oftentimes, babies have an easier time napping in baby swings or car seats than a crib.This is mostly due to the fact that these spaces are more enclosed, thereby mimicking the feeling of being held in mom's or dad's arms.
While these spaces should not be used for naps indefinitely, they can be helpful in transitioning your baby from napping in your arms to sleeping alone. Once your baby adjusts to sleeping alone in a confined space, you can start placing him or her in the open space of a crib during nap time.

, Start your baby on napping in the crib before requiring your baby to sleep through the night there.


Many babies have an easier time falling asleep alone during the day, when things are lighter and more active, than they do at night, once everything quiets down and they can no longer see or hear their parents.

, The transition into the crib may not happen quickly. You may need to stay in the room with your baby as he or she falls asleep for the first few weeks.

"
"
Calm baby down before bedtime.,
Minimize physical discomforts.Pain or other physical discomfort will keep your baby awake no matter where he or she sleeps.,
Get the right setting.",How to Get a Baby to Sleep in a Crib4," Do what you can to relax your baby enough to make him or her drowsy.


Wear your baby out during the day. Filling your baby's day with stimulating play and other activities will naturally make your baby feel more tired and worn out at night. As a result, your baby will be less likely to kick up a fuss about where he or she is sleeping. It might be especially helpful to plan an activity an hour before bedtime to burn off extra energy.
Give your baby a warm bath before bed. Baths often have a soothing effect, and a warm bath can soothe your baby's muscles, making him or her feel physically relaxed. If your baby becomes more alert after taking a bath, however, you should avoid baths before bed.
Try giving your baby a gentle massage. Gently rub your baby's back, arms, and legs to relax the muscles. If this seems to invigorate your child, though, skip this action.

, On the other hand, removing these sources of discomfort will make it easier for your baby to sleep anywhere.


Give your baby a little food before bed. Roughly 2 or 3 oz (60 or 90 ml) of formula or breast milk can fill your baby's stomach enough to prevent him or her from getting hungry a few hours after falling asleep. For babies who are at least six months old, give them 1 or 2 Tbsp (15 or 30 ml) of cereal to accomplish the same task.
Make it easier for your baby to breath by introducing an air purifier or air filter into the room. Contaminants from fuzzy blankets or pets can get into the air, making it hard for your baby to breathe comfortably. An air purifier will remove most of these problems. The ""white noise"" from the purifier can also have a calming effect.
Change your baby's diaper. Make sure that your baby has a clean diaper on immediately before going to bed. Use ""nighttime"" diapers to prevent waste from leaking out and soaking your baby's pajamas.
Minimize teething pain. If you have your doctor's permission, you can give your child a small dose of acetaminophen to relieve the pain.
Make sure your baby has comfortable pajamas. Babies with especially sensitive skin tend to do better in nightclothes made from 100 percent cotton than they do in clothes made from synthetic fabrics.

, Creating a setting conducive to sleep will keep your baby mentally comfortable, as well. As a result, it will be easier for baby to feel comfortable enough to sleep in his or her crib.


Dim the lights. Many young babies can sleep with a little light, but others associate light with being awake and active. Keep the lights off in your baby's room and limit your use of the hallway light while your baby is trying to fall asleep. If your baby is especially sensitive to light, use opaque shades to keep the sunlight out of your baby's room in the morning.
Reduce noise. Most babies can sleep through a little noise, but it is generally a good idea to keep things quiet while your baby is drifting off. Otherwise, he or she may feel as though there is too much action going on to fall asleep. Do not let your television or radio share a wall with your baby's crib, and keep the volume as soft as possible when these devices are in use. Keep your voices low, and avoid having guests over while your baby is trying to fall asleep.
Play soothing music. Try playing recorded lullabies, or place plush toys that play classical music or other soothing sounds in your baby's crib at night. Soft music has a rhythmic quality that proves very effective in helping many babies drift to sleep.
Give your baby something with your scent on it, like a frequently-worn t-shirt.The scent will be familiar, making the crib feel more comfortable and familiar, as well. You may want to remove the item once your baby falls asleep, however, to prevent him or her from accidentally suffocating on it.

Turn the lights off.,
Check the room temperature.,
Move the baby to a different room.,
Turn on soothing music.,
Try making the room quiet.",How to Get a Baby to Sleep2," Keeping the lights on in the baby’s room may keep him/her awake. When it’s dark, the brain begins releasing melatonin, which triggers sleep. Keep the lights off at night, which will help the baby recognize when it’s time to sleep. Dim the lights around the house when bedtime approaches. This will help the baby get ready to sleep by recognizing that the light is starting to fade.
If you need a nightlight in the room, use one that gives off bluish light, instead of yellow or white light. The bluish light will be less stimulating for the brain.

, The baby’s room should be around 70 degrees. This will be the most comfortable for the baby. Cover the baby with a light blanket and he/she should be warm enough.

, If the baby shares a room with an older sibling, it might be too stimulating to sleep. If the baby sleeps in the parent’s room, and someone goes in and out of the room a lot, this can disrupt the baby’s sleep. Move the baby to a different, quieter room.

, Calming lullaby music can soothe the baby and lull him/her to sleep. Nature sounds, such as rain or ocean sounds, are also calming. Play the music at a low volume.


Singing lullabies to the baby will also work.White noise can also help calm the baby. White noise machines can be purchased at major retailers. You can also use a fan or air filter for white noise. Just be sure to point the fan away from the baby.

, While some babies respond to music, others need silence to sleep. Turn off music and eliminate other noises. Close the door to the baby’s room. This will help control sound traveling into the baby’s room.

Rock the baby to sleep.,
Wear the baby.,
Try a baby swing.,
Take a stroll.,
Go for a car ride.",How to Get a Baby to Sleep3," Motion will lull most babies to sleep. They will also respond to your snuggling and will feel safe and loved. Hold the baby in your arms and sway back and forth. Try different patterns of rocking: up and down, side to side, and so on.Try sitting in a rocking chair while rocking the baby.
Some sources caution against rocking your baby to sleep after 4-6 months. The baby may grow dependent on you to put them to sleep. This decision is up to you., Put the baby in a sling or baby carrier. When the baby is close to your body’s warmth, listening to your heart beat, he/she will relax and start to drift off. This is especially helpful if you are trying to get the baby to take a nap during the day. Using a carrier or sling allows you to move around the house or go for a walk while the baby sleeps. , A baby swing is a handy piece of equipment with a motor to rock the baby automatically. Place the baby in the swing and tuck him/her in with a cozy blanket. Switch on the swing and watch his/her eyelids start to droop.


Some babies do not fall asleep in a swing. Instead, they are more stimulated by the movement and will keep their eyes open to watch the world move around them.

, For some babies, getting out in the fresh air can make them tired. Put your baby in a stroller and go for a walk. The combination of the stroller’s movement and the fresh air might make him/her fall asleep.

, Some babies fall asleep easily when riding in a car. The movement of the car is just enough to make them drowsy, while the ""white noise"" of the engine also soothes them. Bundle your baby in comfortable clothes and tuck him/her into his/her car seat with a cozy blanket.

Have a consistent bedtime.,
Play quiet games before bed.,
Give the baby a bath.,
Read a book to your baby.,
Try to have the same bedtime routine every night.",How to Get a Baby to Sleep4," Putting the baby to bed at the same time every night will help his/her body expect to sleep at a certain time. Aim for putting the baby to bed between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. every night.

, Help your baby wind down in the evening by playing quiet games. Keep activity and noise for the daytime. Play your baby’s favorite game right before bedtime so he/she knows he'll/she'll do something fun right before bedtime. , A warm bath can be a relaxing way to wind down. Let the baby splash around in the tub for a little while and then dress him/her in cozy clothes for sleeping.

, Cuddle up with your baby and read a book to him/her in a calm, quiet voice. Even if he/she is too little to understand it, he/she will respond well to your closeness and relax with the sound of your voice.

, Consistency is key with babies. Aim to have the same bedtime routine every night. For instance, try giving the baby a bath, then playing a few games, then reading a book and then turning off the light. "
"
Feed the baby lots during the day.,
Keep a regular nap schedule.,
Keep noisy activities for the daytime.,
Put the baby to bed when he/she is drowsy.",How to Get a Baby to Sleep5," Keep the baby’s tummy full during the day. Babies often get distracted by play that they forget they’re hungry. When nighttime comes, they realize they are hungry and need to eat more frequently throughout the night. Give the baby full feedings throughout the day so her tummy will remain full at night. , Babies should start having a regular nap schedule starting around 2-4 months of age. Babies take at least 2-3 naps per day, depending on age. A baby will not sleep better if he/she skips a nap during the day. Instead, he/she will sleep worse because the brain will release cortisol, a hormone that responds to stress. This will make him/her sleep more fitfully. Make a consistent nap routine to ensure that sleep comes more easily at night.

, Promote good sleep habits by doing noisy activities during the day and quiet activities at night. Your baby will be stimulated during the day, but will learn to calm down at night. He/she won’t expect to play and be entertained at night.

, Try laying down the baby when he's/she’s drowsy but not fully asleep. He/she will start learning how to fall asleep on his/her own instead of relying on you to help him/her. "

Research destinations.,
Add timeline buffers for breaks and acclimation.,
Make reservations with appropriate accommodations.,
Build some adult time into the schedule.",How to Travel With Children1," Find out how long it will take to get there, and the optimal route. If it is only a few hours, a car ride may be your best bet. If longer than a few hours, deciding between a road trip and air travel is critical. If it will be a road trip, find a route that has interesting landmarks, scenery, and places to take breaks. Look up family-friendly attractions near your destination. Museums and great scenery likely won’t keep their attention. Plan a visit to a popular attractions like an amusement park as part of the overall itinerary.
Pre-plan your pit stops so you have convenient stopping points, like restaurants with play places.
Make a list of odd, roadside attractions like the largest bottle of ketchup or a basketball-painted water tower.Look for large truck stops or travel stops where there is plenty of room to walk around, lots of snacks to peruse through, and maybe even a trinket or toy that might draw attention.;
, If you’ve already established that the travel window is minimal without issues, be sure to add in time for extra pit stops, multiple bathroom breaks, and time for them to adjust to new time zones. When returning home, build in an extra day so they don’t have to get back to school the day after getting home. When possible, try to find flights with longer layovers, layovers in new locations, and seats on the plane near the bathrooms.

, Make sure to book a room that is large enough to accommodate everyone. Ensure you have enough beds, parking spots, places to store valuables, a mini fridge, and any supplementary needs (e.g. iron, hair dryer, extra hangers).


Ask for your extras when making reservations. It may be difficult to accommodate on the day of arrival.
There are particular rules for plane travel with children. Research the seat restrictions and the items you are permitted to ship for free before finalizing your itinerary.
When you check in, some locations have unlisted extras like toys, treats, and various kid items. Be sure to ask for whatever extras you can. Hotels are eager to please and retain guests by providing everything possible., However possible, whether it’s looking up care providers in the area, or simply taking turns, ensure you include time for some adult relaxation. If everything is about the kids, and there are no breaks provided, the minimal issues will soon be aggravating enough to irritate and anger.


Schedule a couples massage while the kids are away.
Go somewhere like a bar or a casino where the minors are not permitted.
Find a 4-star restaurant and have a relaxing dinner.

Roll up and place a washcloth between the baby and the crotch strap.

,
Adjust the harness straps.,
Cover the baby with a blanket.",How to Install a Car Seat1," Face the car seat towards rear window. Using the backseat is always safer for infants. This is especially true in a car with air bags. If it is necessary to place the baby in the passenger seat be sure to turn off passenger airbag (Refer to the owner's manual on how to do so).;
, Check owner's manual/ seat belt label for tightening instructions. New car seats may use lower latch anchors to attach the car seat, refer to manual for instructions on how to use these anchors.

, This is so that the baby's head will not flop forward. Never tilt the car seat more than halfway (45 degrees) back. Use an indicator on the car seat or base as a guide. If necessary place a rolled towel under the base (only if the seat's manual says that it is okay to do so).

, This will help prevent irritation from the crotch strap. Do not dress the baby in heavy clothes as tightening the straps snugly may not be possible.

, Use slots next to or below the baby's shoulders and position chest clip at armpit level.

, Padding helps get the baby comfortable. Never use inserts, blankets, or towels under or behind the baby.

,, If you can pinch a loop of the strap, tighten the harness more.

, During cold weather, it is especially important to keep your baby's body warm. Make sure that the blankets are tucked in under the baby and cannot cover the baby's face and neck.

Bring a media device.,
Pack a coloring kit.,
Stuff toys in their travel bags.,
Give them responsibilities.",How to Travel With Children2," The options are nearly limitless, with smart-phones, phablets, tablets, and laptops from many vendors. Keep in mind there are kid-friendly options like the VTech Innotab, LeapFrog Epic, and Fuhu Nabi. While this is a concern for some psychologists, there are plenty of apps developed specifically for children.If you lend your personal smartphone to your child, remember to turn on child-friendly settings like the “Guided Access” on the iPhone.
Remember the headphones. The last thing you, or others around you, want to hear is a game droning the same tune over and over.

, Whether it’s crayons, pencils, or markers, bringing something to draw or color is a great way for your kids to spend time. It’s also something to keep them quiet and engaged in a creative outlet.


If you have more than one child, be sure to pack duplicates of everything. Every parent knows the pain of when both kids want the exact same crayon.
Build an interesting magnetic coloring kit with magnetic tape, super glue, and a cookie sheet to keep the mess to a minimum., Bring a few of their favorites for variety. Large figurines, big foam blocks, and dolls are perfect for little hands. The key is to find something that will occupy their mind for longer than a few minutes and will keep them interested. Try to avoid the small pieces, and things that can be easily dropped in small car crevices.If you’re planning on air travel, be sure the toys aren’t too cumbersome to be carried and stored on an airplane.
If the toys make noise, be considerate and only bring toys that have lower volume settings.

, Kids love to be responsible or in charge of things like adults. While traveling it’s a fun pastime to involve them in the travel, the sight-seeing, and maybe even the timetable of the trip. Ask them to keep track of a specific portion of the directions, maybe a city, landmark, or road to take.


When mealtime nears, ask them to picture their favorite meal and help pick out the location to eat.

Relax nutrition standards.,
Bring plenty of snacks.,
Bribe children with food when necessary.",How to Travel With Children3," While at home it may be easy to provide the perfectly balanced dietary requirements, but on the road it’s not as simple. They’ll see easily recognizable fast-food locations along the road, or there just won’t be the foods you would like to provide. Let them enjoy the trip. You can return to routine when the trip is finished., Kids will be distracted during travel. The mundane observations of daily life, like a plane departing, often provide wonder to little eyes and minds. Getting them to eat normal meals will be difficult, and cries of hunger quickly become irritating. Pack a variety of items (e.g. carrot sticks, pretzels, granola bars, raisins) in plastic bags to ensure you have options.Be careful with sticky or messy items that can cause a mess. While traveling, it’s more difficult to keep a keen eye on little ones while eating.
If traveling by air, avoid snacks with liquids that may cause security issues.
Don’t pack items that have strong smells. Be considerate of fellow travelers.

, There are countless recommendations for travel with children because it’s an often trying, difficult, infuriating experience. Bring bribery material like a few pieces of candy.Bring gum if taking a flight. If your kids are old enough to handle it without making a mess, it’s a treat that may help clear painful Eustachian tube blockages."

Bring backups of every possible clothing item.,
Include a way to clean the kids on the go.,
Prepare for potential travel sicknesses.,
Pack all important and supplementary medication.",How to Travel With Children4," Kids get wet, dirty, and tired of their clothes. Sometimes the shoes they have aren’t the best for the activities of the day. At the very minimum you should have an extra set of clothing for each child at all times. The younger the child, the more likely they will have accidents or messes.


Multiple diapers are absolutely mandatory for those still potty-training. Bring as many as you think you’ll need, then pack a few more.

, Pack travel tissues, some emergency toilet paper, and a multi-purpose, versatile wipe that is safe for hands, faces, as well as after diaper cleanup. Towels and paper towels should be kept around to soak up potential spills and messes.

, Kids are prone to travel sickness because they often aren’t accustomed to the differences between the vision and the inner ear. Have them travel with a small amount of bland food in their stomachs, look at stationary objects, and get fresh air whenever possible.Apply a cold cloth to their head as soon as they start experiencing issues.Don’t forget to pick up appropriate dosages of Dramamine or Bonine
An extra sturdy bag is a great idea for kids prone to motion or air sickness. The bags provided by the airline don’t handle large amounts of liquid very well.
When traveling outside the country, be wary of local produce and water.

, Traveling itself carries a potential for sickness because of new germs and allergens. Prescription medications are an absolute must. Consider children-specific medication like lower dosage, over-the-counter acetaminophen for the occasional fever or runny nose. Add in a few kids’ vitamins to keep their bodies healthy while traveling.


Have an emergency plan and medical location in case your child gets ill while in your travel destination.Research vaccination considerations for international travel.Pack children-specific sunscreen suited to the expected location and exposure to sun.A travel bottle of hand sanitizer can work wonders when curious hands start touching every foreign surface possible.

If you plan on having another child soon, consider a multiple occupancy stroller.;
, Practice putting a doll in the stroller and make sure it's not only comfortable for the baby, but also easy for you. You don't want a belt system so complicated that you'll have to spend 15 minutes fiddling with it or worse, you'll stop using it because it's too much of a hassle.

Organize the bag.",How to Pack a Diaper Bag for a Toddler," Whether the toddler wears diapers, pull-ups, or regular underwear, these are the most important things to pack in the diaper bag. By the time the child becomes a toddler, most parents have a general idea of how often they need to go, so they can usually estimate how many diapers to pack in the bag.


It is a good idea to pack more than the estimated amount, just in case they're needed. If the toddler is new to wearing pull-ups, you should definitely pack a few extras. However, if the toddler rarely has accidents, packing just a few pull-ups should work out fine.
One or two spare pairs of underwear should be sufficient for toddlers that are completely toilet trained.;
, A container of wet wipes is also a good thing to pack in the diaper bag. There are even flushable wet wipes which are great for toddlers that are not efficient at wiping, even if they can use the toilet.

, Just in case the toddler has an accident, it is a good idea to pack at least one full set of clothing which includes a top, bottom, and socks. Even though it might not seem necessary to pack an extra top and pair of socks, it is better to have them handy rather than ending up with a half-dressed toddler.

, This could be anything from diaper rash cream to prescription medications that might be needed while you are away from home. If you pack a prescription medication, it is important to pack it in the original labeled container from the pharmacy so that it is easily identified and the proper dosage information is readily available. Having the medications in the original container also supplies the adult with all of the necessary information if the child develops a reaction. Other medications you should consider packing include:


Child-friendly acetaminophen or Ibuprofen to treat fever.
Antihistamines or decongestants to relieve most symptoms of common cold.
Medication for vomiting.
Calamine for itchiness.
Saline nose drops to loosen mucus.
Antibacterial ointment for cuts or scrapes
Sunscreen for kids (at least SPF15) during outdoor activities
Hand sanitizer to keep hands clean and to avoid the flu.
Bandages and antibiotic cream for wounds.

, You should pack plastic or Ziploc bags for emergency storage. You can use these to store leftover food which your toddler can eat later, or to keep any wet or dirty clothes separate from the bag's other contents.

, This is used to check your toddler’s temperature if you suspect that he has a fever. You can check your toddler’s temperature using a portable ear or temporal artery thermometer, they usually provide a pretty good estimate of the toddler's temperature.


However, an underarm thermometer usually provides the most accurate results. On this kind of thermometer, a reading above 100.4 °F (38 °C) usually indicates a fever.

, Toddlers often become cranky and difficult to handle when they get too hungry or too thirsty. No matter how long you plan to be out of the house for, it is always a good idea to pack a snack and a drink.


This is true even if the outing is a trip to a restaurant for a meal because it may take a while to get the food and it may be too hot to eat right away.

, Pack the food into small travel jars or Ziploc bags to so you can throw them away after eating. The snack should be easy to eat by hand and the pieces should be bite-size. An example of an easily packed snack is dry cereal.

, To avoid spills, the toddler’s drink should be stored in a leak-proof sippy cup. The snack can be stored in a small plastic bowl or a zippered plastic bag.

, This is necessary if you do not want to use the spoon in the restaurant that you are dining in. Some parents also bring disposable or washable placemats to put on top of the restaurant table to prevent germs and make the clean-up easier. .

, Packing a favorite toy or a small stuffed animal can help to prevent a toddler meltdown when things don’t go their way. Some toddlers also like to have their favorite small blanket with them when they are away from home.

, Comfort items to pack in the diaper bag might include anything that keeps the toddler entertained, provided they are not too big or heavy to carry in the diaper bag and that there are not parts that could get lost.


Some examples of good toys to bring would be an electronic tablet with age-appropriate content, a magnetic doodle board, or small toys.
Things like a doll with changeable clothes and shoes would not be a good idea because the pieces could get lost.

, Another form of distraction could be a book that your child can look at, even if she doesn’t know how to read yet. You could also let your child look at an e-book on your own tablet or kindle.

, Organizing the diaper bag by designating pockets or areas for certain items will help you to find a particular item quickly and possibly avoid a toddler meltdown.


If there are not very many pockets, zippered plastic bags can be used to group similar items together.
In fact, a few extra zippered plastic bags can come in handy to hold used diapers until they can be properly thrown away.

Find a local babywearing group or natural parenting store that has a wide variety of carriers for you and your child to try with knowledgeable members or staff to assist you.,
Be sure the carrier provides you the comfort and support you need.,
Make sure that you are using the correct tools to ensure comfort and safety for both of you.,
Position your child in the cradle position inside the sling only while nursing.,
Have your baby ""close enough to kiss"" if they are on your front.,
When using a carrier, make sure that you are using a carrier in accordance with the manufacturer's directions.",How to Wear Your Baby," Babywearing is supposed to be easy and comfortable, and not every carrier works for every person, but there is a carrier for everyone. Some great resources are www.babywearinginternational.com and www.thebabywearer.com.;
, For example, if you have issues with back pain try to purchase a carrier that offers support over both shoulders rather than just one. Also ensure that your child is comfortable in the carrier. Check for red marks created by fabric digging into skin, constant movement of trying to get comfortable, and make sure that baby's rump is well supported in a deep seat (like sitting in a chair) in the carrier. This will make babywearing more comfortable for both parties involved.

, Some carriers are not designed for newborns or preemies at all, and some come with inserts or different directions for various sizes.

, This will offer discreet nursing while your child lays comfortable within the sling. Please be sure to pay close attention to baby's head position during nursing, and if baby falls asleep, gently adjust them to a more upright position to avoid asphyxia hazards. The Cradle position is great for nursing, but should only be used while baby is actively engaged in nursing.

, Do this for the best positioning. You should be able to tilt your head down and kiss their forehead. Facing out is not recommended because it does not allow for proper hip and pelvis positioning for long term carries. If your baby does not like facing in, look into hip or back carries!

, If your carrier does not have directions for forward facing or back carries, then it was not designed to do so and will not be safe for you or your child.

How old is the baby?,
How many babies do you have?,
Where are you going?,
Do your research.,
What features do you need?,
What features do you want?,
Know the terminology.,
Get more than one type anyway.",How to Choose the Right Stroller for Your Baby," If you are buying a stroller for the first time, you are likely doing so for a newborn. You will need a set-up which handles a reclining, floppy-headed baby. A stroller for a child who can hold up his or her head may be different.


Many strollers adjust through babyhood from reclining to sitting. But be sure of this feature.
While you can sometimes use a quality stroller from birth up to toddlerhood, it's more likely you will go through several strollers as your child grows.;
, If you have twins, triplets, or more, you may want to consider strollers designed for a crowd. Also, if you have an older and younger child, you may wish a stroller that can handle this arrangement.

, The type of stroller right for you depends a lot on where you will be using it. Will you be primarily using it to cruise around the mall? Or do you need a stroller that can handle your 5K workouts? You will need to consider your patterns of use so you don't buy a stroller that doesn't fit your lifestyle.

, Baby goods are a dynamic industry, and are always coming up with new and innovative strollers.


Search for Internet stores which offer unbiased reviews of items. www.toysrus.com, for instance, has the opinions of other users. Even if you don't buy from the vendor, the critiques can save a lot of time and effort.
Check for recalls before purchase. Although major retailers are usually up-to-date on safety issues, this may not be true of 2nd hand strollers.
Ask current baby parents, even total strangers. See how it feels for you, and get their opinions. And yes--ask total strangers on the street, in restaurants, and in the mall...very often they're glad to give an honest report.

, Decide what features are critical for you, such as: compactness, modular systems, car seat compatibility, how much space it takes, weight, canopies, adjustable handles, adequate storage space, washable seats, recliner and padded seats, multi-terrain wheels, safety systems, and so on.

, What features are not so critical, but important to you? For instance, maybe you really want a nice color and pattern, but can live with a slightly less aesthetically pleasing one. If you know what you want, but don't necessarily need, it can help you narrow down your choices from a seemingly endless variety.

, There are a few basic type of stroller:


Umbrella stroller: This is the most basic stroller, the kind your parents likely had for you. It is usually inexpensive, lightweight, easy to manage, takes little space, but typically has no other features.
Carseat stroller: This stroller uses the carseat as the base of the stroller. It allows a (sleeping) baby to go in and out of the car without being removed from the carseat. However, it cannot be used except for the first few months.
Standard stroller: Usually, this is a midweight stroller. It usually has a good balance of features, and an excellent all-purpose choice.
Jogging stroller: Originally designed for running parents, this stroller is the best choice for a lot of outdoor use, such as bike paths, trails, and running. However, typically jogging strollers are too bulky for use in stores.

, Maybe it's OK to have more than one stroller. An umbrella stroller might be ideal for travel, as well as having the larger stroller for everyday use.

"
"
Decide what style of stroller you want.,
Determine how much you will use the stroller.,
Work out what you will need the stroller for.,
Make a list of features and accessories you want.,
Try before you buy.",How to Choose a Stroller for Twins," Your first decision involves the sort of stroller you are looking for. Essentially you have two options: a side-by-side model, in which both children sit next to each other, or a tandem, in which one seat is in front of the other.


Side-by-side strollers are usually the same length as a single stroller but tend to be fairly wide, which can prove to be a disadvantage when maneuvering in tight spaces or attempting to fit through narrow doorways. They usually fold more compactly than tandems, however, and are usually lighter, although this largely depends on the make and model. Parents who favor side-by-side doubles like the fact that the seats tend to have more reclining positions, and that both children have a clear, unobstructed frontal view – even though this does mean the parent pushing the stroller cannot see either of them directly. However, side-by-side double strollers are not usually able to accommodate two car seats, which makes them unsuitable for newborn twins.
Tandem double strollers are easier to handle in the sense that they are the same width as single strollers, and so are good for small stores and tight spaces. Many models can accommodate two infant car seats, and – perhaps their best feature – the better ones will offer a variety of seating options: both babies facing parent, both facing forward, or even facing each other. Unfortunately the placement of the seats sometimes means that the child in the back seat has less legroom and a restricted view (which becomes an issue as they get older and want to see more) and parental access and view of the child in the front seat is restricted. The front seat may also have limited recline options, which causes problems for the younger baby who may want to nap in the stroller. Tandems also tend to be heavier when compared with side-by-side strollers, and may be fairly bulky even when folded, so it’s worth checking to see if the one you like will fit in your car boot before you purchase it.
There are other options also available, such as jogging double strollers, which are side-by-side three-wheelers with added stability and a more aerodynamic shape for active parents, and even ‘snap and click’ stroller frames onto which baby bassinets or car seats can be attached. Both are options worth looking into but usually parents will pick a more traditional double stroller and explore these styles further when it comes to purchasing a second or supplementary stroller.;
, This essentially boils down to your budget for this item. Even though most parents of twins consider a good stroller a necessity, you need to balance the amount of use you will get out of a double stroller with the price you will be paying. If, like most parents, you anticipate using it daily and for extended periods, it’s worth investing in a good-quality model with the ability to grow with your kids. That means avoiding double prams – they are only useful until your baby can sit up – and looking for models that can accommodate children up to a reasonable weight, such as fifteen kilograms.

, The activities you intend to carry out with your stroller will determine which kind is most suitable.


If you need something that’s quick to unload from the car and set up, while you’re running errands and dashing into shops, a lightweight, easy-open type is best.
If you know you’ll be taking long walks in the countryside, you’ll need a jogging stroller with large wheels and off-road capabilities.
If you anticipate keeping the babies in their stroller for long periods of time while you shop, you’ll need to look for something with maximum comfort, reclining seats and perhaps even space for food and toys.

, There are any number of features you can find on strollers now, from the basic (like tray tables or reclining seats) to the high-tech (mobile holders and iPod docks). And even though it’s tempting to go for the strollers that seem to offer maximum style and multiple gizmos, think carefully about what kind of practical gear you will need.


If you anticipate spending a lot of time outdoors with the stroller, a rain cover might be a useful extra to have, as would a hood and footmuff.
Food trays are good for storing snacks and small toys to keep little fingers busy, and a large storage basket is always useful.
Some strollers come with custom-made diaper bags, others with specially designed parasols, storage bags or changeable covers.
It’s worth thinking about what you’ll need before you set out to buy, so you can choose a model that comes with the extras included, or so that you can factor the cost of the accessories you’ll need to buy into the final price.

, No matter how sure you are about what you want, there’s always a possibility that you may change your mind when confronted with the stroller in question. Some models look great online or on paper, but turn out to be awkward when you try them out in the store. Others that might not have appealed to you initially could prove winners in maneuverability and comfort tests. That’s why it’s important to ‘test-drive’ the stroller of your choice before you make your purchase. It might be tempting to order online and take advantage of cheaper prices, but then you run the risk of ending up with something you just don’t like. Having said that, if you do decide to buy online, research your choice as thoroughly as possible, read online reviews, and watch videos of the stroller in question being used. You’ll end up with a much clearer picture of what you’re getting, even if you haven’t seen it in a store beforehand.

Use this method for one-hand-fold or FastAction strollers.,
Remove the car seat for strollers without a built in seat.,
Collapse the canopy.,
Tug a strap at the hinge of the seat.,
Use slightly more force for old strollers.",How to Fold a Graco Stroller2," Graco makes many different models of strollers, but they usually advertise their most easily collapsed strollers by referring to ""one-hand-fold"" or ""FastAction"" features. If you know your stroller's model number, look it up online to see if these features are mentioned. If you do not know the model number, you should be able to see whether this method works with no more than a minute or two of effort.

, Graco SnugRider stroller frames are made for use with car seats, and do not have seats of their own. Unstrap the car seat from the frame and remove it before attempting to fold the stroller frame.

, The canopy over the seat, if present, should easily collapse back against the upper handles when you tug the front end backward.

, Graco strollers with the one-hand-fold feature fold so the seat surfaces end up on the outside of the folded stroller. These models typically have a strap beneath where a child would sit, which can be tugged to fold the stroller.Strollers that fold outward may not lock the tray into position while they do so. Remove the tray first to avoid it falling onto the ground and getting scratched or dirty., If the stroller has become rusty or dirty, it may take more force to fold. Attempt to tug it again, with slightly more force, but do not exert yourself too much or brace yourself against another surface for more force. If these methods do not work relatively easily, try the instructions for folding older models.

, Travel system strollers can also break down into car seats. This style of stroller is a particularly useful investment, as it can be used from infancy into toddler-hood. , These three-wheeled strollers have a fixed front wheel and a hand-brake, in addition to the traditional parking break.Avoid joggers if you don't exercise. Their fixed front wheel can make them a challenge to maneuver on varied terrain.
Avoid jogging strollers if you have a child under a year old.

, These strollers are equipped with large wheels that are compatible with a wide variety of surfaces, from store floors to grass. They often have three wheels, with a front wheel that can swivel, or lock in place. Keep in mind that all-terrain strollers are heavy (often weighing up to 30 pounds) and bulky when folded up.
Note that all-terrain strollers are typically not suitable for infants under 6 months, unless stated otherwise.

, Umbrella strollers tend to be inexpensive and lightweight, and they fold up to about the size of an umbrella. However, they are not typically durable or suitable for newborns. , These come in two styles: side-by-side or inline. They are a must-have if you have more than one child. Side-by-side strollers tend to be wide and bulky when folded.
Inline models are better for children with an age gap, as one seat tends to have more recline and leg rest adjustment range that is necessary for young infants.

, Convertible strollers can seat one to two children, as it comes with an easy-to-add second seat. These are great if you alternate between traveling with one or two children, or if your elder child has nearly graduated from their time in a stroller. Convertible strollers tend to be built to handle up to 100 lbs, and are applauded for their longevity.
On the downside, the heavy-duty material of convertible strollers can be frustrating when the stroller is seating only one child, as it will be heavier than traditional single strollers.

Look for padding and comfort.,
Look for adjustable backrest options.,
Get a canopy.,
Consider if you need handbrakes.,
Look for a five-point harness.,
Consider what features will best benefit you as a parent.,
Purchase accessories separately as needed.",How to Buy a Stroller2," Being able to adjust and swivel the wheels can be a back saver; look for a stroller that has wheels which can be adjusted for more difficult terrain or for tight spaces. Swivel front wheels can make it easier to move around and the ability to lock the wheels straight ahead is useful for rough terrain or for high speeds (such as jogging)., You will be able to tell the difference between a well-padded seat area and a flimsy one. Soft, cushy seats can encourage a restless toddler to stay seated during a longer shopping trip. Many times, seat liners can be purchased separately. , An adjustable backrest that allows the stroller to fully recline is necessary for young infants who have not yet learned to sit up. Plus, the ability to fully recline is great for when your child falls asleep., A stroller should have decent shelter options to protect your baby from the sun and inclement weather. Some strollers have a wide brim, some have bug netting, and others even have a plastic waterproof feature that can be rolled down during rain.


Avoid lightweight fabric covers. Fully covering your stroller may unintentionally lead to a greenhouse effect, so instead go for options like umbrellas that create shade but do not restrict air circulation. , Most strollers come with the traditional foot-activated brakes, but many strollers also come with a second set of brakes on the handlebars. These are particularly useful if you intend to be traveling at high speeds, such as when you are jogging. , Five-point harnesses attach to the seat at five different points—at each shoulder, at each hip, and between the legs where the harness buckles. These are safer than the alternative three-point harnesses, which lack the additional attachment at the hips. If your child is in a rear-facing seat, the shoulder straps should be at or below the shoulder. In a front-facing seat, straps should be at or above the shoulder.

, Strollers can include features such as drink holders, consoles that can hold your keys or diaper bags, and even speakers that connect to your smartphone to play music for you child.Strollers with larger wheels (e.g., joggers) will need their tires pumped up from time to time; look for a mini tire pump that is portable so that you don't put off pumping the tires up.

, For truly unique additions, consider checking Etsy or local craft shows.


Take measurements. Be sure that accessories will fit your model before you purchase that large canopy or snap-on cup holder."

Open and close the stroller.,
Look for a full-length bar and practice steering.,
Test the brakes and swivel lock mechanism.,
Ensure that it can be carried by you and that it fits where you need it to.,
Consider resale value.",How to Buy a Stroller3," Before you even leave your home, have an idea of what you would like to spend on a stroller. Strollers can range from $20 to $1000, so have an idea of what features you would like to have, how durable a stroller is expected to be, and what you are comfortable spending. , Make sure it feels stable under your hands and maneuver through aisles and around corners. Add weight, such as a bag, to ensure that the performance will not significantly change as your child grows. , A good stroller should be able to be opened with one hand and a foot. This enables you to keep one hand free to hold the baby as needed. At the same time, check the latch on the stroller to make sure that it is sturdy - some strollers have collapsed when this latch comes undone.

, Steering is much easier with a full-length bar across the top than with two handles. If a single bar stroller is not an option, look for a stroller with very strong handles that are comfortable to hold. In both cases, adjustable handles are a good option if you are taller or shorter than average. , To ensure that brakes are easy to use and make for a smoother, controlled, and safer ride, practice braking with the stroller up and down aisles. If the front wheel is maneuverable, test the locking mechanism to see if it dramatically impacts your ability to steer the stroller., Nothing worse than a stroller that you cannot lift and fit into the back of the car! Ensure that you are comfortable with the stroller's weight and that it fits in your car or in your designated storage space.

, If you do not anticipate having more children, you may want to sell your baby products after your child has grown. In this case, you may choose to invest in higher-quality merchandise that will retain value. Check websites like Craigslist to see what used strollers are selling for. "

½ cup of boiled spinach contains about 133 mcg of folate. To incorporate broccoli into your child’s diet, try putting a cup into a green smoothie along with milk, ice, spinach, dates, and strawberries. You could also mix it into macaroni and cheese for a tasty, cheesy broccoli experience.
Brussels sprouts are also a good candidate for smoothies or mac and cheese. Alternately you could dice them and put them in a light summer salad. Mix the sprouts with lettuce, dried cranberries, walnuts, blueberries, and a drizzle of strawberry balsamic dressing. Your child will love the fresh, crisp salad.;
, Bagels, pasta, and other products made with enriched or whole grain flour contain significant amounts of folate.For instance, ½ cup of enriched egg noodles contain 138 mcg of folate. A plain bagel contains approximately 101 mcg of folate.


Kids love bagels or toast with jam.
Look for whole grain waffles. Serve them to your child with fruit and maple syrup for a delicious breakfast.

, Black-eyed peas, lentils, chickpeas, and beans all have high levels of folate (lentils for instance contain about 479 mcg per 100 g). These vegetarian protein sources are the best choice to ensuring your child obtains vitamin B from protein.


You can’t go wrong with beans and rice. Mix some barbecue sauce into the beans to give them a bit of tangy sweetness.

Children four to eight years old require 200 mcg of folate each day
Children nine – 13 years old require 300 mcg of folate each day
Teens 14 – 18 years of age require 400 mcg of folate daily

, It is also in “enriched” bread, flour, pasta, and other grain-based products. Research shows folic acid can reduce the risk of heart disease and birth defects; however, excessive folic acid might conceal a vitamin B12 deficiency and symptoms of anemia. Excessive folic acid might also be linked to cancer.


If your child takes a multivitamin with folic acid or vitamin B9, avoid foods fortified with folic acid.
Enriched bread and flour — compared to regular whole wheat bread and flour — contains over six times the normal amount of folate.With this much folate in the product, you can easily feed your child too much.

Give your child animal products.The most concentrated sources of B6 are in animal products like beef, chicken, turkey, and fish.,
Feed your child produce rich in vitamin B6.,
Feed your child whole grains.,
Give your child a supplement.Like other B vitamins, B6 is available as a standalone supplement.,
Ensure your child is getting the right amount of B6.Your child should start out with a relatively small amount of B6 in his or her diet.",How to Feed Your Child Enough Vitamin B3," Eggs and dairy are also rich in vitamin B6.


Add fish to your kid’s diet to help them get an adequate amount of vitamin B6. Even kid-friendly fish sticks contain enough to make a difference (about 0.4 mg).
Many kids enjoy scrambled eggs and toast with jam. Try giving this classic combo to your child to ensure they get enough vitamin B6. One egg contains around 0.121 mg of B6.
Like folate (vitamin B9), animal liver is a good source of B6 (3-oz of beef liver contains about 0.5 mg), but should be fed to your child sparingly so as to avoid negative health impacts.

, Many vegetables provide a natural source of vitamin B6.For instance, carrots, corn, spinach, beans, and lentils are all great sources of B6. Bananas are the one fruit with a notable level of B6 — a small banana contains 0.37 milligrams of B6.Nuts and sunflower seeds also contain high levels of B6. Peanuts contain about 0.5 mg per cup, while sunflower seeds contain about 1.9 mg per cup.
Instead of chips and cheesy treats as an after-school snack, try giving your child nuts and granola with raisins. Kids love this crunchy mixture, and it will give them plenty of B6.
Banana slices on toast with peanut butter makes a great breakfast or after-school snack.
Instead of using cow’s milk in your child’s cereal or hot chocolate, you could try soy milk. This is a great source of B6 (about 0.2 mg per cup) and also has lower levels of cholesterol.

, Whole grain foods are those which include all three parts of the grain — the germ, endosperm, and bran. Foods made with whole grains contain B vitamins — including B6 — that refined grains do not.Identify grain-based products that your child enjoys like waffles, bread, sandwiches, and cereal. Give your child these foods to ensure they get their vitamin B6.


A second option is to eat enriched grains which have B6 and other B vitamins added back into the mix; however, enriched grains have different proportions of the B vitamins than originally existed in the grain. Whole grain products are considered the best.
Brown rice is another grain that you can give your child to help them meet their B6 needs (about 0.3 mg per cup). Try making brown rice with sautéed vegetables in teriyaki sauce, or brown rice pasta in a rich alfredo sauce. Brown rice works well in tacos, too.

, You can get B6 in capsule form or in liquid form.


Be sure you get the children’s version of B6 so that your child doesn’t get the wrong amount.
If you feed your child liquid B6, follow the directions to ensure he or she receives the correct dosage.

, As they age, their B6 intake will increase. As men and women become adults, their levels of B6 begin to vary slightly.


Babies up to six months old need 0.1 mg daily
Babies seven – 12 months old need 0.3 mg daily
Children one – three years old require 0.5 mg daily
Children four – eight years old require 0.6 mg daily
Children nine – 13 years old require 1 mg daily
Teenage girls require 1.2 mg daily, and teenage boys need 1.3 mg daily
It is almost impossible to get too much vitamin B6. As long as your child is not consuming more than their recommended daily caloric intake and not swallowing B6 supplements by the handful, they will not get too much vitamin B6.

Bring along the usual baby gear.,
If you're going to a non-babies and mothers session, things may be a lot more difficult because other patrons don't want to have their experience spoiled.,
Try to avoid 3-D or 4-D movies, because they sometimes startle infants.,
Breastfeed.",How to Bring a Baby to the Movies," These are much easier on both you and the baby because crying is actually not an issue! Usually the cinema will turn up the sound to drown out crying, so if you have an ultra-sensitive baby, you might like to take the sound into account, or ask the cinema if this is what they do.;
, It's more fun when you're going with a friend and the babies know one another.

, Obviously, extra diapers in case of an accident. Most cinemas have baby changing areas by law.

, Here are some things to consider if this is the case:


If the baby starts crying, excuse yourself from the theater for a little bit. Try to sit at the end of an aisle near an exit so that you can make quick departures and returns if needed. A small keyring LED light (red light) can be helpful to have for this situation.
Sometimes people do not like children. Try to ignore it if someone makes a face. If they are rude to you, be polite but firm that you are entitled to be there too (but still remove the crying baby).
Bring your baby a quiet toy or bottle to try to calm your baby down or to keep her distracted.

Avoid deep fried meats., 2 slices of whole grain bread will have about 7 grams (0.2 oz) of protein. Use whole grain bread to make meat or cheese sandwiches or serve it as toast with a small cut of butter., Beans, lentils, and chick peas make for a healthy, high protein side dish. Tofu and edamame dip, both coming from the soy bean, are also high in protein. One cup of beans or hummus provides between 15 and 25 gram protein.Some children may not like the taste of lentils so try mixing them with other foods like chopped meat, cheese, and/or rice.
You can also add spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, paprika, cumin, oregano, or pepper.

Feed them peanut butter.,
Offer them yogurt.,
Encourage them to snack on cheese.,
Provide nuts and seeds.",How to Feed Your Child Enough Protein3," Peanut butter is an excellent source of protein at 8 grams (0.28 oz) per tablespoon and a favorite among children. Peanut butter on crackers, baby carrots, and celery sticks all make for excellent snacks. You can also go with the classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich for a meal.Peanut butter is high in cholesterol so it shouldn’t be fed to them every day.

Dress up your food.,
Pretend so that the kids appreciate it more.,
Tell the kids that the food is something that it is, well, not.,
Have a small ""Food Inventing"" contest.,
Tell your kids that if they eat some food on their plate that they do not like, they can have a treat such as staying up 5 minutes later.,
First ask them about it.,
Don't wolf your food down!,
Have a blind eating contest.",How to Get Kids to Start Trying New Foods," No, it doesn't mean that you have to put a bonnet on a piece of celery. Try spreading peanut butter on a piece of celery with raisins on top of that. Tell the kids that it is ""ants on a log."" You could also give them raw veggies instead of cooked. They may like the looks and taste of them better than cooked vegetables. Like raw broccoli with ranch dip. You could compare them to ""snowy trees"" or something of the sort. Just be creative with it. (This does not always work, especially for children who are a bit more mature and can tell the difference between food they like and what they hate; no matter how deformed the food may be);
, For example, tell the kids that you want them to serve the food to you. Have a pre-prepared meal sitting where they can see it. Have them bring the healthy food to you and give them fake tips. Participate in eating the food with them. Try not to show any disgust if you eat a certain food that you particularly dislike; it might motivate the child to copy your actions and hate it as well.

, For boys you could tell them that a new dish of yours is Superman or Mr. Incredible's favorite meal and that's where he gets his muscles. For girls you could tell them that it is what all the beautiful princesses eat to make them so beautiful. You could also include some food truths, like letting them know that eating carrots can help their eyes, so they can see things better. And stuff like yogurt and cheese gives them strong bones, so they can save the world without breaking something. If you want, you can also make the food to look as if it were something children would think that their favorite people would eat.

, Give them a bunch of fruits, vegetables, spreads, tortillas, rolls, lunch meat, anything you can think of, and tell your kid to invent a new delicious snack. One catch, though: they have to use at least one thing they don't normally eat. If you have more than one child, you could tell them that it's a contest to see who can make the tastiest new snack. Kids in general, especially boys, love competitions, and they might just discover that that vegetable they wouldn't eat really isn't so bad after all. If they have found something they like (something mixed with something else), don't allow them to always have it. It makes them less likely to eat their full meal.

, Don't make the treat too big of course and don't give them a treat every time, as then your kids will get used to the idea that if they eat yucky food, they will get a reward.

, If that does not work, then put it on the side of their plate. Make it look good; they might try it.

, It may cause hiccups and your child may never like it again.

, Tell them that whoever finishes the dish first wins. Put fruits and vegetables on the plate, and food with calcium, also. You could tell them at the end of the contest what they just ate.

Choose the right time to eat.,
Make time for breakfast.,
Feed your kids high-protein foods.,
Give your kids carbs.,
Avoid high-fiber foods.,
Don’t try anything new.",How to Fuel Your Kids Pre‐ and Post‐Game1," Avoid feeding your kids immediately before their game. If their stomach is busy digesting food while you’re they are to play a sport, they could experience stomach cramping or aches. Plus, their body will not be able to contribute the maximum amount of possible energy to their sport, because some will be used for digestion.If your child eats three or more hours before their game, they should eat a small meal with carbs and a moderate level of protein. For instance, if they are eating at 12:00 and their game is at 4:00, it would be acceptable for them to have a meal.
If your child eats between one and three hours before their game, they should eat only a small snack that has more carbs than protein. For instance, if their game is at 4:00, they could snack sometime between 1:00 and 3:00.
Have your child eat at different times before their games. Monitor their reactions to see what makes them feel best. Ask your child, for instance, ""Do you think you played better when you ate a meal or do you think you played better when you had only a smaller snack closer to game time?"";
, Even if your kid has the best snack before the game, if they have not eaten since yesterday, it will do them little good. A substantial breakfast will help provide energy to use later in the day. Try whole-grain cereal, yogurt parfait, or whole grain and fruit muffins.If your kid has an away-game and you must travel, grab some healthy breakfast items you can eat on the go, such as bagels, bananas, apples, string cheese, yogurt cups, juice boxes and low-fat milk., Protein helps muscles grow stronger and recover quickly. There are many options for feeding your kids protein. For instance, you could try:Yogurt with fruit and nuts mixed in
A handful of nuts, or a mixture of nuts, raisins, and chocolate nibs
Oatmeal with a spoonful of protein powder, milk, and fruit bits

, Carbohydrates — or “carbs” — give your kids the energy they need to perform at the top of their game. Carbohydrates are available in abundance in foods like brown rice, whole-grain cereals and breads, and starchy vegetables.


They might enjoy vegetables like potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn and peas. Try a small baked potato or sweet potato with cinnamon.
Some athletes try “carb-loading” — eating an excess of carbs before an athletic contest or event. There’s no need to give your kids more carbs than they need. Don’t insist that your child eats a certain volume of carbs before their athletic contest. Kids are good at knowing their limits and should eat until they feel full before an athletic event.
Many of the high-protein foods listed in the step above also have high carbohydrate content, which make them good choices.

, Feeding your kids high-fiber foods might make their stomach upset during the game. Certain fruits (like strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and pears) and legumes (like peas, beans, and lentils) should especially be avoided.It’s okay to consume high-fiber foods after the game.

, If you know that your child performs well when eating a particular set of foods, don’t encourage them to try a whole other set of foods right before their game. Doing so might result in even better performance, but it could also result in upset stomach, cramps, and decreased athletic performance.If you and your child want to adjust their athletic diet, try doing so before a scrimmage or practice session. Evaluate the results by asking your child if they think they felt and performed better after eating the new diet.

Eat at the right time.,
Feed your child a post-game snack of carbs and protein.,
Have a post-game meal.",How to Fuel Your Kids Pre‐ and Post‐Game2," After an intense workout or sporting event, your child should get a snack of some carbs and protein within about 20 minutes. For instance, if your child’s game ends at 4:00, they should have some mixture of carbs and protein by 4:20 at the latest. Then, about two hours later, your child should eat a larger, proper meal. In other words, assuming again that your child’s game ended at 4:00, they should be ready to eat a meal around 6:00 or 7:00., A post-game meal or snack should consist of a 3:1 ratio of carbohydrates to protein. So if your child is hungry for about 400 calories, for instance, 300 of those calories should derive from carbs and 100 of those calories should derive from protein.If your child has a favorite protein or carbohydrate, encourage them to consume some following their workout.
Your child might enjoy a post-game smoothie. Blend one cup of milk or water, three ice cubes, one banana, three slices of canned pineapple, and a spoonful of chocolate or vanilla protein powder. This tasty treat will not only give your child much-needed carbs and protein, but will also rehydrate them.
You could also provide your child with half a sandwich — try baked sweet potato slices on two slices of whole grain bread slathered with peanut butter. Your child is sure to love this carb and protein combo.
Don’t let your child fill up immediately after the game. They should leave room for a meal later.

, About two hours after your child’s game ends, they should eat a regular, balanced meal. Even though your child athlete just consumed protein and carbs during their post-game snack, it’s okay if the meal include these elements, too. The meal should also include small amounts of healthy fats, as well as vitamins and protein.You don’t need to go out of your way to introduce healthy fats and oils to your child’s post-game meal. These dietary elements are present in nuts, dairy products, and meats.
Important vitamins and minerals for child athletes include calcium (which is present in dairy products, kale, and collard greens), iron (which is found in orange juice and leafy greens), and potassium (found in bananas, dates, beans, and oranges).Ask your child what their favorite food is and serve it to them as part of their post-game meal. Just ask your child, “What is your favorite food?”
If you want to increase the camaraderie on your child’s team, you could ask your child if they wish to invite their friends to dine with them.

Eat with your child.,
Prepare your child to eat healthily both pre and post-game.,
Discourage diets.,
Encourage your child to snack during the game.,
Keep your kids hydrated.",How to Fuel Your Kids Pre‐ and Post‐Game3," Both before and after your child’s game, dine with them. Kids tend to eat healthier when they dine at home with their parents. When your child sees you making healthy dining choices, they will do the same. Plus, dining with your child athlete will give you two the chance to bond.Busy parents might find it difficult to coordinate their schedule so that they can eat with their child every night, or even before and after every game. Set time in your schedule to do so, and eliminate or reschedule obligations that are less important like organizing your stamp collection or folding the laundry.
Use a daily planner to write down the dates of your kid’s athletic events so that you will be sure to eat with your child and see their match.

, If you are unable to be with your child before or after their game, leave something in the fridge that they can quickly and easily warm up on their own. Inform your child that their pre or post-game meal is available for them, and let them know when they should eat it. If you will not be around with your child after the game to ensure they receive a post-game snack packed with carbs and protein, place the snack in a bag or lunch pail along with a bottle of water so that they can keep their energy up and rebuild their tired muscles., Unless your child has been instructed by a medical professional to lose weight, your child should not be on a diet. Likewise, encouraging or allowing your child to gain weight in order to “bulk up” for a particular athletic activity is a bad idea. Kids need a balanced, healthy diet in order to grow strong. If your child dramatically increases or reduces their calorie intake significantly — or adopts a fad diet like a high-protein diet — this could negatively impact their health., It is not necessary to snack during games lasting an hour or less. But if your child’s game lasts more than an hour — and especially if they’re pushing themselves hard — they might want a small snack. Provide your child with an energy bar, a banana, or a small box of raisins in the event you expect their game to last over an hour.Remind your child that they are not obligated to eat the snack, but can if they get hungry.

, Fill a water bottle with cool water so your kids can cool down and quench their thirst as needed. Encourage your child to drink water or an electrolyte-rich beverage with low-to-moderate amounts of sugar every 15 to 20 minutes during physical activity.Remind your child before the game that they should be drinking regularly even if they are not thirsty.
Do not provide your child with sugary drinks like soda and sweet juices. These beverages can spike the blood sugar levels, leaving your children with a quick burst of energy, but a steep decline in energy once the spurt wears off.

Know what foods to serve at each meal.,
Start each day with a balanced breakfast.,
Prepare balanced lunches and dinner to keep your child’s energy up throughout the day.,
Prepare balanced snacks because they help with energy needs and keep children from becoming too hungry by the next meal.",How to Feed Your Child a Balanced Diet1," A child’s nutritional needs change throughout the day. Each meal and snack are planned to give your child the most optimal mix for that time of day. Each meal should be nutrient rich, especially for younger children and toddlers, to keep up with their bodies’ demands as they grow rapidly. Below are some minimum amounts to serve. Every child is different and some may need more. Also, some children may require more calories on certain days due to heightened activity or growth spurts. It is important to follow your child’s lead on how much they eat because they are learning how to regulate calories and listen to their bodies.;
, Eating breakfast does more than break the fast. It sets the stage for the day. When breakfast is eaten, children are better able to focus and learn. Breakfast also tells the body to start burning calories and keep burning calories throughout the day. Each age group has different needs.


Children aged 1 to 2 years old should have 1/2 cup of milk or 1/4 cup of fruits or vegetables or 100 percent juice, and 1/4 cup or 1/2 slice of enriched or whole grains (bread, bagels, oatmeal, grits, etc.) for breakfast.
Children aged 3 to 5 years old should have, 3/4 cup of milk or 1/2 cup of fruits or vegetables or 100 percent juice , and 1/4 cup or 1/2 slice of enriched or whole grains (bread, bagels, oatmeal, grits, etc.) or 1/3 cup cold cereal for breakfast.
Children aged 6 to 12 years old should have 1 cup of milk or 1/2 cup of fruits or vegetables or 100 percent juice, and 1/4 cup or 1 slice of enriched or whole grains (bread, bagels, oatmeal, grits, etc.) or 3/4 cup cold cereal for breakfast.

, Children need to eat a healthy lunch and dinner with minimal refined sugars to keep their energy going throughout the day and night (they grow while they sleep). Complex carbohydrates found in whole grain bread or brown rice help children sleep at night because the body takes longer to digest and use the complex carbohydrates than it would a simple carbohydrate found in candy or white bread.


Children aged 1 to 2 years old should have 1/2 cup of milk, 2 servings consisting of 1/4 cup each of fruits or vegetables or 100 percent juice, 1/4 cup or 1/2 slice of enriched or whole grains, and 1 oz.

Let your child have some choices.,
Keep snack times focused.,
Don't engage “picky eating.” Your child may demand snacks other than what you have already prepared.,
Make snack time fun.",How to Encourage Your Child to Eat Healthy Snacks1," Making some simple snacks available and letting your child pick their favorites can be a good way to engage their interest. Allowing them to control some toppings or extras can keep snacks healthy and allow your child to feel involved in their nutrition.Offer two to three snack options and allow your child to pick.
Offer a few basic options like carrot sticks, broccoli, or fruits.
Provide some healthy dips like yogurt or hummus.
Ask your child, ""Would you like carrots and hummus or an apple and yogurt?"" Then allow them to choose between the two.;
, Helping your child engage with their food will require you to keep snack time focused and free of distraction. If your child is watching television or listening to music they may not be interested in or focusing on their food. Try to keep snack times focused on eating and talking about the snack to help your child have a good connection to the healthy food being offered.Continue to use a high chair for your younger children, as this will keep them focused and in one spot.
Make sure the television is turned off during snack time.
Try to ask your child questions about their food. Have them describe qualities of the food rather than if they like it or not.

, Making something special to meet these wishes can send the wrong message to your child. “Picky eating” habits might start to occur if your child thinks they can reject and demand whichever foods or snacks they want. Allow your child to eat only the snacks that you are offering..If you are concerned about your child not eating enough or getting proper nutrition, talk with their pediatrician to learn more.

, If you tend to criticize your child's eating habits or try to force them to eat something they don't like, snack time can become something they dread. Instead, try to make snacks that they enjoy. If your child finds snack time enjoyable they will be more likely to eat and try new healthy foods that you introduce.Be supportive and encouraging as your child tries new foods.
Try offering additional food items such as hummus, mashed avocado with lime juice, yogurt, peanut butter or other nut butters for your child to dip their food.
You might try using a cookie cutter to make your snacks into fun and amusing shapes.
Arranging vegetables on a plate to make silly faces can make snack time more fun.

Tell your child about the health benefits of eating vegetables.,
Persuade your child to eat some (but not all) of what you've put on the plate.,
Try reverse psychology.,
Make up a game so that eating vegetables is more fun.

,
Hide vegetables in foods your child likes.,
Make sure the adults set a good example.,
Don't make it a big deal.,
Consider their motivation.,
Include your child in the preparation of the foods.,
Tell your child which vegetables are your favorites, which are favorites of other people they like.,

Try juicing.,
Add minced or grated vegetables to sauces or to other dishes they enjoy.,
Talk to their teachers and see if there are foods served in schools they seem to enjoy.,
Help your child to grow a vegetable garden.,
Add more low sugar fruits to their diet if they become to vegetable resistant.

",How to Encourage Children to Eat Vegetables,";
, Example: ""If you take two more bites, you can be done. I'm sure you can eat two more bites. Let's count.""

, Say something like, ""I wouldn't eat that if I were you.""

,, For instance, put vegetables on pizza or in a casserole.

, Children pick up cues from adults and siblings when it comes to food. If people grimace or complain about eating foods there is a good chance the child will too. Children will often pick up the picky eating habit from those around them.

, Sometimes the pressure to eat it makes a child leery. They will think of eating certain foods much like being forced medication.

, If the child gets extra attention when they don't eat their vegetables they may continue to protest and cause problems at the table.

, A proud child will often try their own creations.

, Children often try to imitate and may be more open to trying a vegetable that is their big sibling's or grandparent's favorite.

, It may be more than a question of taste. If your child seems to protest against certain cooked foods, textures or shapes you can try the raw option if it is safe. Some children also have color preferences. You may need to adjust your menu until the phase passes.

, Juicing is a fun way to get important vegetable nutrients.


For the busy parent some vegetable juice blends are available in the produce section. Try different varieties until you find a blend your child likes. There are more options than just V-8.
You shouldn't replace all vegetables with juice an important fiber is lost in the juicing process.
If necessary, juice when they aren't around so the real ingredients can't be seen.
Keep track of the ingredients you use. You may find a combination of ingredients they prefer and you may need to recreate the recipe.

, Pizza's are also a great place to hide finely chopped vegetables.

, Sometimes they become accustomed to foods being prepared a certain way and may reject the way it is prepared at home.

, Talk to your local greenhouse and plant vegetables that are quick growing and easy to care for. They'll learn and become eager to try new vegetables.

Plan the meals ahead for the following week.,
Give yourself plenty of time to grocery shop.",How to Feed Your Child a Balanced Diet2," It is important to have different options for the meals and snacks to give your child variety and introduce new foods. Children are getting used to different tastes and textures, so by exposing children to more food variety they will become accustomed to different tastes and textures.


It may help to get your child involved with the planning since most children like to exert some control over their life and eating is one area in which they tend to do it often. You could show them pictures of different foods and ask if they would like to try them. You could also find ways to work new ingredients into their favorite foods, like adding cauliflower to macaroni and cheese (since cauliflower is white, it blends well with the macaroni and cheese and could be a good way to introduce that flavor and texture into their diet).

, Feeding your child a balanced diet does not mean everything has to be homemade, but you will want to pay attention to the labels on packaged food.


For instance, your child enjoys chicken nuggets so you buy frozen chicken nuggets to meet the protein requirement. When you read the label, you realize the chicken nuggets have more than just chicken in them; they have soy protein, gluten, and sodium phosphate added to them. Although these items are not bad for your child, they are not that good for your child either. These ingredients help fill your child up without giving them the proper protein and nutrition they need.
Reading nutrition labels will help you identify all the other frozen options available. Giving yourself time to familiarize yourself with food labels will make it easier to identify which packaged food to serve your child and shopping will start to become easier.

Prepare as much food in advance as possible.,
Look for the healthier options.,
Pre-portion as much as possible.,
Prepare pantry staples in advance.,
Cut meat into portions while still raw and then freeze.,
Get your child involved with making the meals.",How to Feed Your Child a Balanced Diet3," It can be helpful to have options readily available to curb the impulse to buy ready-made snacks and dinners.


Many ready-made snacks are high in calories and sodium and very low in nutrients. Buying fast food for lunch or dinner has the same issue—it fills the child up without supplementing their diet with the nutrients they need. It is ok to have fast food or junk food every once in a while, but plan for it and you will be less likely to splurge too often.

, For example, instead of fried with a sandwich, prepare apple slices for your child’s lunch, and choose milk instead of soda.

, Cutting vegetables and fruits and pre-portioning them is a great way to help save time.

, Rice and pasta hold well in the refrigerator when made in advance but whole wheat pasta tends to dry out, so store it with a little extra water to keep it from drying out too much.

, A small food scale can be purchased for under $10 at most stores and will make it easier to portion meat.

, By getting your child involved, they get to feel like they accomplished something. It also helps get them familiar with any new foods in advance so that when it is time to eat, they won’t be surprised. This can make mealtime a fun time to look forward to.

Make sure your kids also get vitamin D. Vitamin D, which comes from sunlight, helps the body absorb calcium.",How to Feed Your Child Enough Calcium," Calcium is found in a variety of dairy products, so incorporating healthy dairy into your child's diet can help them get enough calcium. Go for plain yogurts, cheeses, and milk.Children age 2-3 should have 2 cups of dairy per day, while children 4-8 should have 2 ½ cups per day. Children between 9 and 18 should have 3 cups of dairy per day.If your child is lactose intolerant, focus on getting calcium from other sources. However, lactose intolerant children may be able to tolerate small amounts of milk and yogurt when they're mixed with other foods like cereals.;
, Fruits and vegetables should be a staple of every healthy diet. Calcium is found in a variety of fruits and vegetables. To up your child's calcium intake, include the following fruits and veggies in their diet:Oranges
Rhubarb
Collard greens
Spinach
Bok choy
Beets
Turnips

, If you serve your child cereal for breakfast in the morning, look for calcium-rich options. Opt for brands of cereal fortified with calcium. This is a quick, easy, and healthy way to add calcium to your child's diet.Make sure to read a cereal's nutritional label prior to purchase. Cereals, especially children's cereals, are sometimes high in added sugar. Pick a calcium-fortified cereal without a lot of sugar.

, Sources of protein often contain calcium as well. Go for lean meats, beans, and nuts for healthy sources of calcium from protein. Choose some of the following for your child:White beans
Eggs
Hummus
Salmon
Sardines
Soybeans
Tofu fortified with calcium

, Many kids love drinking juices like orange juice for breakfast. At the supermarket, choose calcium-fortified juices. This is an easy way to get more calcium in your child's diet.Make sure the juices you choose are made without added sugar.
While calcium-fortified juice is healthy in small doses, limit their consumption to 4-6 ounces per day. Juice has a lot of sugar and does not contain the same nutrients as whole fruit.

, When choosing foods at the supermarket, go for foods marked ""calcium fortified."" Cereals, bread, tofu, and other products are often fortified with calcium. If you're going to be serving something like bagels for breakfast anyway, grabbing calcium-fortified bagels is a great way to up your child's calcium intake without a lot of extra hassle., Add yogurt and milk to your child's meals to up their calcium intake. You can add yogurt and milk to smoothies, sauces, batters, and fruit salads to up your child's calcium intake Make sure to opt for plain yogurt. Flavored yogurt often has a lot of extra sugar.

, When serving your child snacks, make sure they're packed with calcium. Give your kids things like crackers with cheese or fruit mixed with plain yogurt. Use cottage cheese or hummus as a dip for vegetables like carrots and celery., Beans, especially white beans, are often rich in calcium. Add white beans to soups or top salad with white beans or chickpeas.Beans can be used as a staple for a meal instead of meat. Try making a vegetarian meal once a week using beans for added calcium intake. You could, for example, serve vegetarian chili made with beans.

, Calcium is important to your child's diet. However, you do not want your kids to get too much calcium. Make sure you track your child's overall calcium intake and feed them the right amount based on their age.Between the ages of one and three, children need 700 milligrams of calcium per day.
Between four and eight, children need 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day.
Between 9 and 18, children need 1,300 milligrams of calcium per day.

, Milk can be a good source of calcium, but it is not the right choice for all children. If you want to give your kids milk as a source of calcium, wait until they're at least one year old. Children between one and two should only drink whole milk and you should limit the intake to 16 ounces per day. After the age of two, make the switch to low-fat or skim milk.While milk is the best-known source of calcium, it is by far from the only source. If your child dislikes milk or is lactose intolerant, you can get enough calcium from other sources.

, Calcium supplements can help if your child is not getting adequate calcium from their diet. You should talk to your doctor before putting your child on any supplement, however. If you're concerned about your child's calcium intake, make an appointment with a doctor to talk about supplements., Encourage your children to play outside each day.When your children are playing in sunlight, make sure they wear sunscreen.

Switch things up.,
Involve your child.,
Work with your child's appetite.",How to Encourage Your Child to Eat Healthy Snacks2," Eating the same things at the same times can get dull for both children and adults. In order to keep your child's interest in eating healthy items, it can be a good idea to switch things up from time to time. Consider trying some of the following tips to keep snacks exciting and interesting:Avoid offering the same snacks everyday.
Try combining snacks. For example, adding yogurt to cereal can make a new snack option.

, Giving your child some control and influence over snacks is a great way to make healthy eating engaging. Whenever you go shopping with your child, try letting them pick out some healthy items, such as fruits or vegetables that they find appealing. This can get them excited about healthy foods and cause them to look forward to the next snack.While shopping for vegetables or fruits, ask your child which ones look appealing.
When shopping for any healthy snacks, let your child choose one that they would enjoy.

, During snack time your child may or may not be hungry. Forcing them to eat or not feeding them enough can result in problems during full meals. A good way to get your child eating healthier is to work with their own appetites.If your child isn't hungry, don't force food on them.
Try offering small portions. Offering too much food during snack or meal time can cause problems."
"
Start early.,
Keep a good routine.,
Don't force new-foods.,
Lead by example.,
Avoid using unhealthy foods as “rewards.” It may be tempting to offer unhealthy food as a reward for eating well.",How to Encourage Your Child to Eat Healthy Snacks3," The sooner your child is exposed to a wide range of healthy food choices, the more likely they are to enjoy them as they grow older. Start as early as you can in your child's life to help them build a love for healthy food choices and avoid difficulties later on.Try ""eating the rainbow"" with your child, offering foods that are a variety of colors. Blueberries are blue, asparagus is green, plums are purple, tomatoes are red, etc. These different colors show that the foods offer different nutrients and vitamins, allowing your child to have a well-rounded diet.

, Offering snacks at the same time each day can help your child to learn what to expect. Regularly spaced snacks can also help regulate your child's appetite and allow them to fill up on healthy choices throughout the day. Try to avoid serving any food or snacks outside of the usual times for the best effect.Try to serve snacks at regular times during the day.
Even if your child asks for a snack, it can be a good idea to wait until your predetermined snack time.

, New foods are totally new experiences for your child and they may take some time to get used to them. Even if they don't like the new food at first, they may come to enjoy it over time. Don't stop offering the food, but also don't force your child to eat new foods when first introducing them, or you risk them losing interest permanently.Be patient when introducing new foods. Your child may later enjoy foods that they initially reject.
Keep putting a small portion of the new food on their plate, even if they didn't want to try it.
It can take 10 or more offerings before you child starts to enjoy a new food item.
Forcing your child to eat a food can actually cause your child to hate that food item.

, A big part of helping your child eat healthy and enjoy doing so is by eating healthy yourself. By setting a good example of what healthy eating means for your child, you can help them feel a sense of achievement when they follow that example. Eating the same things as your child does can also help them feel that they are being treated fairly and aren't being deprived of any “grown up” foods.Eat the same things that your child eats.
Don't eat unhealthy snacks that you removed from your child's diet.
Try snacking together on some healthy items and letting them know how good you think it tastes.

, However, this method of rewarding good behavior can cause future problems. Your child may come to view the rewards as “better” than the healthy options you are offering. The goal is to have eating well to become viewed as its own reward.For example, don't offer a cookie if your child eats a few orange slices.
If you do offer a reward, try offering a healthy snack such as yogurt or a sweet fruit.

Consult your child's doctor about their diet.,
Choose lean protein sources.,
Add more milk and cheese to your child’s diet.,
Go for Greek yogurt.,
Make sandwiches with two slices of meat.,
Keep sodium-free nuts handy for quick snacks.",How to Add Protein to a Child's Diet1," Before making any changes to your child's diet, it's best to talk to their pediatrician first. Discuss your concerns with them, and ask if they suggest dietary changes or vitamin supplements.Tell the doctor about your child's activity level and any symptoms you've observed, such as sudden weight loss.;
, Skinless poultry, fish, eggs, and unsalted nuts are better for overall health than higher fat options, like red meat. Daily requirements vary based on a child’s age, sex, and activity level:Children two to three years old need two ounces in the protein food group per day.
Children four to eight need four ounces per day.
Preteen boys and girls up to age 18 need five ounces per day.
Teenage boys need six and a half ounces per day.
Examples of one ounce servings include an ounce of meat or fish, one egg, a tablespoon of nut butter, and a half ounce of nuts or seeds.

, In addition to being great sources of calcium, dairy products also add protein to a child’s diet. Offer your child two to three servings of milk, cheese, or yogurt per day.Low-sugar fortified cereal or oatmeal with milk are great breakfast options.  
Try making grilled cheese sandwiches with two to three slices of cheese to increase the meal’s dairy content.
Go for lactose-free or non-dairy milks, yogurts, and cheeses if your child is lactose intolerant., Greek yogurt contains more protein than regular yogurt. If your child isn’t a fan of the texture, try making smoothies and parfaits with it.You can blend or mix honey and fruit with Greek yogurt for a healthy snack or dessert.

, When you make sandwiches for lunch, try doubling the slices of meat to increase the protein serving. Adding cheese to the sandwich also adds nutritional value.Processed deli meats can contain a lot of salt, so look for lower sodium options and try to limit your child’s sodium intake elsewhere., Kids need lots of daily nutrients, but their stomachs are still growing. Smaller meals and snacks throughout the day are best, so keep healthy, protein-rich snacks on hand. Go for unsalted nuts and seeds, like peanuts, almonds, and pistachios."

Wean children off of high-sugar breakfast cereals.,
Reduce your child’s consumption of sugary spreads and jams.,
Avoid sugary yogurts.",How to Cut Sugar Out of Your Child's Breakfast1," These types of cereals have one of the highest sugar contents of all common breakfast foods for children. Not only will these sugar-rich breakfast foods give the child little substantial nutrition, they will soon give the child a sugar rush and then leave the child with little energy until their next meal. Work on removing these high-sugar offenders from your child’s diet.High-sugar cereals include nearly all brightly colored, popular children’s cereals: Trix, Fruit Loops, Captain Crunch, Frosted Flakes, and Apple Jacks, among many others.
Cereal bars—often used as a quick breakfast during a rushed morning—can be very high in sugar as well, and should not be served to children as a standard breakfast item.;
, Although these may not be as conspicuously sugary as breakfast cereals, a large amount of children’s breakfast sugar intake comes from spreads and jams. Non-fruit-based spreads like Nutella are high in sugar, but even many fruit-based spreads have added sugar. When purchasing a jelly or jam, look to see if it’s flavored with natural or artificial ingredients, and avoid spreads that have had sugar added.If children still want jelly or a fruit-based spread on their morning toast or bagel, look for one that contains chunks of actual fruit, as this will at least provide some vitamins and fiber.

, Yogurts—especially those marketed to children—tend to have high sugar contents. Even yogurts which are marked “healthy” on their label can still contain high amounts of sugar. While certain yogurts may be marked “low-fat” (probably indicating that they’re made with low-fat milk) this means nothing about the sugar content. Low-fat yogurts can still be quite high in sugar.If you’d still like to serve your child yogurt, or your child requests yogurt for breakfast, make sure that they’re eating a low-sugar yogurt. It’s better still if children eat yogurt with granola or fruit mixed in, as this will give them fiber and vitamins.

Sneak eggs into meals.",How to Add Protein to a Child's Diet2," Make fun snack kabobs by cutting mild cheese and fruit into cubes and pyramids, and add cherry tomatoes for another shape. You can also try the same technique at lunch or dinner by cubing veggies and serving them with meatballs.Try giving shape-inspired and other meals cute names. Saying, for example, “Do you want to eat some cool squares and triangles?” might more appealing than offering boring cheese and apples., If your child is picky about milk, you can always add powders and syrups flavorings, like chocolate and strawberry, or just buy ready-made flavored milk. Some can contain lots of sugar, so choose a sugar-free powder flavoring or check nutritional labels to find the lowest sugar option.You can also see if your child prefers soy milk over dairy milk or try offering chocolate soy milk.

, Peanut, cashew, and almond butters are widely available and all contain lots of protein. Try offering different kinds to your picky child to find their favorite.Serve nut butters as a snack with apples, carrots, celery, or whole grain crackers.

, If your child doesn’t like eggs, you can still use them to add extra protein at any meal of the day. In addition, eggs are great binders, so they’ll add function and nutrition to meatloaf and meatball recipes.Try scrambling eggs with cheese and your child’s favorite veggie.
You can also make French toast by dredging bread in a mixture of egg, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar.

Find ways to include tofu and tempeh in meals.,
Experiment with soy-based meat alternatives.,
Give your child nuts and non-dairy milk every day.",How to Add Protein to a Child's Diet3," Two to three daily servings of legumes will help add protein to a vegetarian child’s diet. You can serve beans and lentils in a variety of ways to keep your child’s interest:Vegetarian chili
Bean-based soups
Adding chickpeas to salads
Hummus
Black bean or chickpea veggie burgers
Bean and non-dairy cheese quesadillas

, Tofu comes in a variety of textures, so you can use it in lots of dishes. Scramble soft tofu like eggs, and mix it with rice, pasta, or put it in a sandwich. Cube firm tofu or tempeh and add it to stir fries or try baking them into nuggets.If your child doesn’t like tofu, try adding silken tofu to fruit smoothies, puddings, or soups. Its flavor and texture will be disguised, but it’ll still add an extra serving of protein.

, Soy-based burger patties, sausage links, and other meat alternatives are widely available. These could be great solutions if you want to switch your child from a meat-based to vegetarian diet. Try multiple varieties to find out your child’s favorites.Try serving tofu sausage links with hash browns for breakfast. Have a barbecue and serve burger patties and hot dogs made with soy, black beans, and rice. Ask your child which variety they prefer.

, Along with two to three daily servings of legumes and soy-based products like tofu and tempeh, milks and snacks will help ensure your child consumes enough protein. Soy milk contains plenty of protein, and unsalted nuts are a healthy snack choice for both animal-based and vegetarian diets.Try to offer two to three servings of non-dairy milk and unsalted nuts per day.
In addition to offering nuts and seeds as snacks, you could sprinkle chopped peanuts over oatmeal for breakfast or in a dairy-free parfait for dessert. For dinner, you could saute sliced almonds with green beans.

Arrange the blooms in a cluster.Twist the wire together to connect the flowers and secure the twisted wire with florist’s tape.",How to Make a Baby Shower Corsage1," Alternatively, you can choose white flowers so that the corsage remains neutral. The design can be used to create either a lapel or a wrist corsage after the greenery and ribbon are attached.
, If you choose fresh flowers, then be sure to make the corsage within 24 hours of the shower. A silk flower corsage can be made well in advance.


If you want fresh flowers, check and see what blooms are in season in your area. Blooms that are in season are easier to find and are often much more affordable., You can choose one large bloom, three medium blooms, or five small blooms.

, For instance, choose daisies in one color or a variety of different colored daisies.. Leave about a 3” (8 cm) stem on each bloom.

, Poke florist’s wire into the base of the blooms. Then, wrap the wire loosely around the length of the stems. For a 3” (8 cm) stem, your wire should go around about seven to nine times.


Cut the wire. Wrap the wired stem with florist’s tape. Florist wire can be difficult to cut through, so use proper wire cutters for safety.







, This will protect the blooms and hide the wire., You want to bend them at a 90° angle right at the base of the flower. The flower should face forward instead of upward.

Serve children a grain cereal or oatmeal.,
Top your children’s toast with fruit.,
Read the nutrition label for sugar content and nutrition information.,
Stay away from breakfast foods with excessive added sugar.,
Serve non-processed whole foods.",How to Cut Sugar Out of Your Child's Breakfast2," As a replacement for high-sugar, low-fiber breakfast cereals, serve children a cereal replacement that provides fiber and nutrition. Cereal brands like Kashi and Wheaties (and many health-food cereals) will give children fiber and whole grains. Oatmeal made with grain (not instant oatmeal) is far healthier than sugary cereal, and can be sweetened by slicing a banana on top.If your children insist on eating cereal for breakfast, check the nutrition label and look for options that contain fewer than 5 grams of sugar per serving. Look for brands like Cheerios and Kix, which are relatively low in sugar and contain some fiber., Rather than serving children high-sugar fruit spreads, you can use fruit itself as a naturally sweet and vitamin-rich topping. Some fruits like bananas, blueberries, and raspberries can be lightly mashed and spread on top of toast or a bagel. Other fruits, such as apples or pears, will need to be sliced and placed on top of the toast.For example, if your child usually has a fruit-based jam on their morning toast or bagel, replace the spread with a layer of sliced fruit.
If the consistency of sliced fruit is unpleasant to your child, you can first spread a thin layer of peanut butter on top of the toast or bagel, and then layer the fruit on top of that.

, This label will give you reliable information about the contents of breakfast foods and will not contain vague marketing labels like “low-fat,” or “healthy.” Look for breakfast foods (cereals, jams, etc.) which contain nutritional value: things like fiber and vitamins. Also look for food options which contain a relatively small portion of the child’s recommended daily sugar intake.

In general, children consume roughly 11 grams of sugar each morning, which is roughly half of the sugar they should be consuming in a single day.Reading nutrition labels can help you reduce this daily sugar intake; aim for 4–5 grams of sugar with breakfast.

, Plenty of foods contain natural sugars: fruits, for example, are routinely high in sugar. This is a small concern, since fruits and other naturally sweet foods offer vitamins and fiber. Of more concern are foods with large amounts of added sugar (or artificial sweetener), which will boost your child’s breakfast sugar intake without offsetting this with nutrition. Avoid serving children any foods with high amounts of added sugar or sweetener and focus on serving items with natural sugars.If you’re looking on the nutrition labels of your child’s breakfast foods, added sugar will be listed as fructose, dextrose, honey, molasses, corn syrup, or nectar.

, Whole foods—including fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and unprocessed meats—are far healthier than other options like white bread and fruit yogurt. Non-processed foods will also retain their fiber, vitamins, and other nutritional values. These healthy breakfast foods will nourish your children and give them energy for the day.For example, you could serve your child a breakfast including whole-grain toast topped with natural peanut butter and a sliced banana, plus a hard-boiled egg and a small container of plain yogurt flavored with sliced fruit."

Children should be drinking minimal soda in general, but should especially avoid it during breakfast, when their bodies need nutrition to give them energy for the day.It goes without saying that children should not be given energy drinks such as Red Bull, Monster, Rock Star, and others. These drinks are packed with both sugar and caffeine and, if drank for breakfast, will first make children jittery and then tired for the rest of the day.

, Many fruit juices—especially those marketed to children—have added sugars, and are nearly as high in sugar as sodas are. Fruit juices also contain no fiber.Read the nutrition label before you purchase fruit juice, and avoid any that have primarily artificial ingredients or that contain large percentages of sugar. Sports drinks—such as Gatorade and PowerAde—are also very high in sugar; discourage your child from drinking these as well.

If your child demands fruit juices, you can slowly wean the child from the juice by diluting the juice with a little bit of water. This will reduce the sugar content in the child’s drink, and the amount of water can be slowly increased over time.

, Although limited amounts of naturally flavored fruit juices—which do contain some healthy vitamins—are fine, children only need to drink milk or water on a daily basis. These drinks will keep kids hydrated and give them calcium without boosting their morning sugar intake.If children are reluctant to stop drinking soda or fruit juices, you can negotiate: ask them to drink a glass of water before each glass of fruit juice.
Alternately, serve milk or water in glasses that appeal to children and distract from the contents of the glass. Look for glasses or plastic cups in fun shapes and colors that appeal to your child.

Consider more specific notes of inspiration when your kids may be worried about a school event or test. For example, write notes such as, ""You're going to do great on that spelling test!"" or ""I'm so proud of all you do. Stay focused and you will do great!""
Provide them with a sense of hope and joy through words and pictures. Use smiley faces or pictures of strength to emphasize what you say.;
, If you're inclined to gush all your feelings, go ahead and make that known to them. Older kids might see it as embarrassing, but younger kids may love your caring words.Consider very simple words of love, such as ""I love you"" or ""Love you always.""
If you're into writing poems or using flowery language, get creative by making a poem of your own or finding one that fits your child's reading level.
Use pictures or drawing with hearts and stars. Make them feel special and add more design to your words of love.

, Teach kids the values of everyday reminders, since kids can be forgetful sometimes. Remember that this is a reminder for them around lunch time, so it's more useful to remind them of late afternoon activities at school or after class.Maybe you're more worried about your child forgetting about something, so it's a quick way to get them to remember. Just make sure to provide support and encouragement rather than judgment.
For example, ""Enjoy your awesome lunch! Remember that your aunt is picking you up after school today. Love you!""
Reminder notes can also help you to encourage them to talk with their teachers or school staff, if there's something pressing. For example, ""Remember to ask for another permission slip from your teacher so you can go on the school trip. Have an awesome lunch!""

, Consider adding some silly things that make your kid laugh. Kids often enjoy comics or silly little jokes. Add a few into your child's lunch box from time to time.Find some short, kid-friendly jokes that tickle your child's funny bone. For example, ""What's the king of all school supplies? A ruler!""

You can also add your own humor with silly or wacky pictures and funny faces with notes attached.

, Sticky notes are easy-to-use and inexpensive. This way you can add notes regularly to your child's lunch box.


Try different colors and designs as an easy way to be creative.
Add little doodles or drawings on the sticky notes for more fun.
Sometimes just a simple message is all you need to brighten your kid's day. Such as ""Have a great day!"" Don't overthink it.

, A picture is worth a thousand words. Consider adding some photos or drawings that help to inspire or remind your child of how special they are.Kids (and adults) always enjoy fun pictures of cats, dogs, and other animals.
Add things into your message that interest your kids. For example, if your kid is really into the latest superhero movie, consider adding some pictures and inspirational messages featuring the superhero.
If your child is feeling down, remind them of some great memories with friends and family. Add an extra photo or picture to show that they have a strong support system.

, If you're feeling more crafty, mix it up with the paper notes, and instead find other materials to write your notes on. If you like to do handicrafts, then each note can become a little art project.


Consider using paper napkins as materials for notes. Or even more creatively, write a fun note on the outer peel of a banana.
Kids enjoy stickers, glitter, and little bits of color. Give them notes that sparkle and keep their attention. Rubber stamps can also liven up designs in a fun and easy way.

It can help to teach your child to slow down and admire each item they're eating.Be playful and creative with the kid's food. The more appealing the food looks, the more likely they'll get excited about lunch time. Kids appreciate fun designs as much as adults.
For example, use cookie cutters to make different designs in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Or make ants on a log with celery sticks, cream cheese and raisins.
Fun designs with the food itself can brighten your child's day in the same way as a sweet note does.

, Notes of encouragement can motivate your child. Consider notes that push your child to eat all their meal--even the healthy stuff. Consider gradually easing in more healthy foods over time if they are resistant to healthy eating.Choose healthy and kid-friendly snacks like these to pack: fresh fruit, cheese sticks, yogurt, pretzels, trail mix, dry cereal, nuts, graham crackers, pudding cups, and fig bars
Pick lunch meals that offer a variety of foods including protein, carbohydrates, vegetables, and fruit. Add also sweet or salty treats that compliment the meal.
Organize the items in such a way that it seem more attractive to eat all the foods in the lunch box, rather than just the sweets. Lunch boxes with small compartments, like bento boxes, are more fun and interesting for kids. Make each compartment of the lunch box feel like a gift.

, Have your children be an active part in the process of choosing items for lunch and making their lunch. Teach them about nutrition and how to balance their meals with different food groups.


Make grocery shopping a collaborative effort. Create lists of items to purchase before heading to the grocery store. Have your child check off when an item is placed in the grocery cart.
Consider making meals before the morning of. This way, both you and your child will have more time to work collaboratively on the lunch box meals.
If your child is old enough, consider having them make their own meals in the morning or ahead of time. This can help to instill responsibility. Just make sure to check the lunch box before they head out, and make changes as needed.
If your child ends up making their own lunch, then make sure to add the note at the end. Just tell them you added a little surprise in there.

, This bath sheet should be labeled ""Feeding Time"". Lay the towel under your child's eating space, whether it is the high chair, the table or anywhere else. Adjust it to cover as widely as possible around the child. When the child drops food, it will fall on the bath sheet, rather than on the floor, collecting splats, crumbs, and all.

Wrap a plain vase in the pages of picture books.

, You may choose to arrange the flowers yourself or have a professional do this for you. If you choose to have a florist make the arrangement for you, take your color palette and vase or base combination to the flower shop, so that you can explain exactly what your vision is for the centerpiece.


To arrange the flowers yourself, work in layers. Create a base, support layer with leafy green stems or dense flowers like baby’s breath. Trim these stems about half an inch from where they create a “v”, then criss cross them from the corners or edges of your base to create a good support base for the rest of the arrangement. Remove the bottom leaves to avoid molding the leaves and rotting the water.Trim the flowers as you go to fit the your height preference.
Start with your largest blooms, then add different types of flowers with progressively smaller blooms.
Add odd numbers of each type of flower until your arrangement looks complete.

Think about what the new parents need or want most right now.,
Select a gift of an appropriate magnitude.,
Consider giving the gift of yourself.,
Choose a gift that will remind the parents of you.,
Package the gift attractively.,
Create a themed ensemble of gifts.,
Include everything the new parents will need to enjoy your baby gift.,
Put the gift together for them.,
Include a gift receipt.,
Include your full name and address discreetly on the card.",How to Give Baby Gifts They'll Remember," Start with the registry, if they have one.;
, The new baby’s Godparent, of course, is usually expected to give a “bigger” gift than one of the parents’ coworkers. You have plenty of range in the gift you choose, and of course you should stay within your means—the parents will understand—but neither appear too cheap nor too grandiose. Remember, the magnitude of a gift is not solely determined on how much it costs: the amount of time you put into a homemade gift, for example, is just as important.

, For example, a coupon to baby-sit, especially at night, is often a big hit with new parents. So are offers to do chores around the house, run errands, or make dinner. Simply give enclose your “gift certificate” in a card, and let the parents redeem it when they need some help. Be sure, of course, to follow through on your commitment.

, If you’re a songwriter, write a song (or, if you want to stick to registry, get a musical toy), or if you’re the parents’ insurance agent give the new arrival a security blanket. Don’t limit your thinking to your occupation, however. Think of an attribute or experience that one or both of the parents most associates you with and choose a gift that will evoke that.

, Even an expensive gift looks cheap if it’s delivered in a plain paper bag. Choose unique wrapping papers, and take the time to wrap your gift well. Don’t restrict yourself to store-bought papers, of course: you can package your gift in a number of creative ways, such as a diaper cake or a stork diaper delivery.

, A creatively bundled package of small gifts is always memorable. For one thing, many small items take longer to open and thus can appear “larger” than a single gift of comparable magnitude. For another, bundling gifts also allows you to be creative. Put together a ""Nursing Survival Kit,"" for example, with breast pads, Lansinoh cream, frozen peas (to ease nursing soreness), and a copy of a book like “The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.” Or create a ""Sleep Like a Baby"" gift basket with a soft baby blanket, a white noise CD, and some herbal teas.

, For example, if your present requires batteries, include a small package of batteries (the correct type, of course) with it. You don't even need to give the whole pack—just the right amount for the item you've given.

, The best baby gifts for new parents are those that require no work on their part to enjoy.

, They may love what you've gotten, but they may have also received two or three baby gifts just like it. Make it easy to return yours, and they'll be grateful.

, This makes it easy for the sleep-deprived parents to keep track of the gifts and write you a thank-you note. Better yet, write your own stamped, self-addressed thank you note! If the new parents are close friends and have a sense of humor, they'll appreciate this trick. Write yourself a Thank You note from them, with humorous options they can check off, such as: “We loved the gift and we think you're the best,” or “Thanks for the gift, but we hate it so we'll be returning it.” Of course, it's all meant in fun.

Select a fabric.,
Create a pattern.,
Cut the fabric.,
Fold the diaper.,
Fill the diaper with candy.",How to Make a Diaper Candy Holder Favor," Thicker ones work best, like felt or fleece. Choose one that fits the theme of your shower or the gender of the baby, if known. You can figure on making 3 diapers with every square foot (0.1 square meter) of fabric, if you use the same size as listed below.;
, Cut out an equilateral triangle of 6 inches (15.25 cm) on each side. This will result in a diaper that is about 2.5"" (6.35 cm) wide. If you're not sure exactly how big you want the final product, you can use paper towels to create test patterns. Fold them using the directions below until you are sure you have the right size. Then, measure a triangle of the same dimensions on a sturdier material, such as cardboard.

, Trace the pattern on the back side of the fabric and cut it out. Cut carefully so the edges are smooth.

, Lay the triangle down with one side parallel to you and one point at the bottom. If only one side of the fabric is patterned, lay it that side down.



Fold the bottom point upward so it overlaps with the top side slightly.







Fold each side point inward to create overlap.







Tuck the remaining tip, at the top, behind the newly folded sides. Secure it all with a safety pin.







Tuck the corners inward to create ""leg holes"".

Finished.",How to Make a Motorcycle Diaper Cake," The following list explains exactly what is needed (also see Things You'll Need below for the crafting items):


At least 34 diapers (newborn or early stage)
2 receiving blankets
2 bibs, a chain linked toy (appropriate for a newborn or infant)
1 pair of infant socks
1 baby bottle
1 washcloth
1 plush stuffed toy (that does not contain buttons or any items that could pose a choking hazard).;
, Start by lining one side and stacking the diapers on their side so they sit upright, but placed horizontally. As you build up one wall side, migrate to the other side of the pan and build up that area.

, Keep creating the swirl shape.

, Wrap one of the rubber bands or soft elastic loops around the perimeter of the diapers.

, You may want to ask a friend to help with this because if a single diaper slips from the band, you’ll have to start the process all over again!

, Do this inside the pan the same way you designed the first swirl.


Add the rubber band around the diapers, then gingerly lift the tire from the pan and set next to the first diaper tire.







, Cover the rubber band or elastic loop with the ribbon. This improves the look and helps to give the impression of a tire.


Pin the ribbon in place, leaving the pin at the bottom of the tire so it doesn’t show.







, If necessary, iron the blanket to remove wrinkles.

, The roll must be tight enough to fit in the middle of the diaper tire hole. Pin the blanket roll in place.

, Match the ends so the blanket is hanging out half and half. The roll must remain in place, so pin each end of the blanket if necessary.

, Join the blanket from the first diaper tire to the second tire. Align the tires next to each other so they form the base of the motorcycle.


Tuck the end of the blanket into the hole of the second diaper tire. Pull gently so the blanket easily holds the two tires in place.






Add a pin on the ends of the blanket to ensure the blanket stays in place inside the tires.







, Then roll the blanket the same way you rolled the first blanket.

, Slide the blanket completely through the hole until both blanket ends meet.

, Keep the graphic or child’s name visible and facing outward.

, Slide the ring toy through the top so they hold the two blanket ends. Slide the toy until it is almost all the way down to the diaper tire.

, Check that it fits snugly.

, Slide a small piece of rolled-up light cardboard inside each handlebar roll.

,, Try to pin in place if they don’t hold naturally.

,, You may need to pin the toy in place, especially if the toy is pliable.

, You now have a fun, cute and very useful gift to give to the expectant mom.

Give your guests as much notice as possible.,
Decide how much information you want to share.,
Be as honest as you can.,
Send cards if the shower is several weeks away.,
Send an email if you are short on time or to save money.,
Make phone calls.,
Get help from a friend.,
Encourage guests to return or donate their gifts.",How to Cancel a Baby Shower1," As soon as you know that you need to cancel the shower, start planning how best to inform everyone. The sooner you let them know, the less disturbance it will cause for them and their schedule. Of course, if something unexpected occurs and you have to cancel at the last minute, your friends and family should understand., If the reason is painful, you may not want to share details with everyone who was invited to your baby shower. Plan the reason that you will give for why you are canceling.


For those you are less close to, you can write a card or email saying something like “Dear Cynthia, I’m writing to let you know that my baby shower on August 19th has been canceled. I’m sorry for any inconvenience that this causes, and I hope to see you soon! All the best, Lisa.”, If you feel comfortable sharing the details of your situation, consider letting your guests know why you're canceling. Your guests should understand and be empathetic. This may bring you all closer, and can help you feel supported in whatever you’re going through.

, If you are canceling the shower several weeks in advance, send cards out to your guests by regular mail. You can create a notice using a computer program such as Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign, or you can write the cards out individually if you have the time. Consider using cardstock to print or write the cards.

, If you have to cancel only a week or two before the shower, it may be too late to send cards by mail. Instead, send an email to all of the guests letting them know that the shower has been canceled. Emailing the guests is also a great option if you are trying to save money, since you won’t have to pay for cardstock and postage.

, If you need to cancel the shower at the last minute, calling will be the fastest way to ensure that all of your guests know that there won’t be a shower. It will be more difficult to give no reason for the cancellation over the phone, so prepare what you would like to say in advance. You can leave a voicemail telling the person the news if they don’t answer.Regardless of how far in advance you are canceling, consider calling your close friends to let them know, rather than sending a card or email.
On the phone, you could say something like, “Hi Cynthia! It’s Lisa. I’m sorry for the short notice, but we’ve actually decided to cancel my baby shower. There is just so much going on with preparing for the baby’s arrival that we’ve decided to wait. I will keep you updated if we reschedule!”
If you choose not to share a reason, you could say, “Hi Cynthia! It’s Lisa. I’m sorry for the short notice, but due to unforeseen circumstances, we’ve decided to cancel my baby shower.""

, If it is too distressing or overwhelming for you to inform all of the guests, ask a close friend or your partner to help you make phone calls, send cards, or send emails.

, Depending on when you cancel, your guests may have already purchased gifts for you. In your cancellation card, email, or phone call, you may want to give them ideas of what to do with those gifts. Tell them to either return them, or donate them to a charity that accepts baby supplies."

Select diapers with a fun design.,
Form the top of the diaper cake.,
Roll up and secure seven more diapers.,
Create centerpiece for the middle layer.,
Create the base in the same fashion.,
Secure the layers together by carefully inserting one or two wooden dowels through the base layer.",How to Make a Diaper Cake1," Most diaper packages have a see through side panel or a picture of the diaper on which you can see the design on the diapers. Buying diapers with a colorful design will enhance the fun look of the cake.;
, Roll up a diaper, starting at the ""open"" top end. Wrap a rubber band around the rolled diaper to stop it from unrolling. Again, using colorful rubber bands can be a nice touch.This diaper will form the center of the layer.


An alternative is to use a baby bottle as the center of the top layer.

, Place them around the center diaper (or baby bottle) so that they are all evenly spaced. Keep them together by placing a large rubber band around all of the diapers. Large rubber bands can be purchased at your local office supply store.The rolled up diapers should form a circle.

, Again, this can be a rolled up diaper or some oblong gift (such as a bottle of baby lotion). Roll up 15 more diapers and place them around the centerpiece. Secure them with a large rubber band.

, Place a rolled up diaper or a gift (perhaps a toy or rolled up piece of baby clothing) in the center. Roll up 30 diapers, securing each with its own rubber band. Place them around the centerpiece and secure with a large rubber band. For the base, make another middle layer. Then add about 30 more diapers around it using a larger rubber band.

, Next, carefully stack the other two layers on top of the base layer, being careful to get the dowels between the diapers and not through any of the diapers.

Cancel your caterer as soon as possible.,
Inform the venue.,
Return or donate decorations that are unused.",How to Cancel a Baby Shower2," If you asked a caterer to provide food for your shower, let them know of the cancellation as soon as you can. Each company has a different policy—some need only a few hours’ notice, while some may need a couple of weeks. Regardless of the policy, don’t hesitate to call them and explain your situation to see if they will offer you a refund., If you were planning to host the shower at a venue other than your home, call them or drop by to explain that the shower needs to be canceled. Similar to canceling a caterer, many places will be able to sympathize with your situation and will be understanding. Just be kind and honest as you let them know that you will no longer need to use their venue.


If you already made a deposit for the venue, you can ask about a refund if needed.

, Many decorations, linens, and party favors may be able to be returned. If you purchased items that you won’t need and haven’t opened, try returning them to the store where you bought them. If the items were opened, try finding a local charity to donate them to.


Homeless shelters may find cups handy, and a charity shop, such as Salvation Army or Goodwill, will appreciate linens. If any food or drinks can’t be returned, see if you can freeze them or share them with friends.You can also try selling slightly used or opened items on eBay.

Place a half-finished roll of paper towels upright on a table.,
Remove the diapers from the package and flatten them out.,
Place another diaper along the paper towels so that it is overlapping the first.,
Place a large rubber band around this base layer.,
Repeat this process to form the other two layers.",How to Make a Diaper Cake2," The roll of paper towels will be the centerpiece of the cake that will hold the layers together.You can also used a rolled up blanket or a large bottle of baby lotion as the centerpiece. However, a roll of paper towels will be the easiest centerpiece to work with.

, Place one diaper so that it is lying horizontally along the roll of paper towels.

, Repeat this process so that you form overlapping layers of diapers around the paper towels. You can make this bottom layer as large or as small as you want, just keep in mind that this is the base layer so the other two layers will get progressively smaller than this one., If you have someone to help you do this, it will be easier. Hold the diapers in place around the paper towel roll. Have your helper slip the rubber band over the diapers so that they are secured against the roll.

, The layers should get progressively smaller than the base, with the top layer being smallest. Secure each layer with a large rubber band.

Wrap a ribbon around each layer.,
Place decorative embellishments on the cake.,
You can wrap the diaper cake in cellophane or netting to help with transportation.",How to Make a Diaper Cake3," Place the cake on a piece of cardboard and outline it with a pencil. Remove the cake and cut the circle out of the cardboard.


You could also place your cake on a decorative plastic tray or a cheap pizza pan.

, Make sure that the rubber bands are covered. Cut the ribbon so that both ends overlap slightly. Secure the ribbon together by taping the two ends together.


You can wrap more than one type of ribbon around the cake. Wrap each layer in a different type of ribbon or wrap a large ribbon around each with a thinner ribbon layered over the larger one.

, Add fake flowers to the cake by sticking the stems between diapers. Stuff colorful pieces of tissue paper down the paper towel roll (if you used Method Two) and add flowers coming out of the top. Go to your local craft store and see what decorations you can find.

, (This is an optional step.) Tie the netting together at the top with a bow, or add a stuffed animal to the tie for a ""topper"" to the cake.

Find several pie or cake pans in different sizes.,
Start filling the largest pan first.,
Keep filling the pan with diapers to form a swirl.,
Wrap some string or a rubber band around the middle of the diaper ""cake."",
Repeat the process for the other pie pans.,

Consider the colors.,
Use items that the new mom will find useful.,
Consider mimicking a real cake.,
Attach the decorations so that they are easily removable.,
Stack large items, such as soft toys, on top of the cake.,
Place the finished cake on a decorated cardboard circle.",How to Make a Diaper Cake without Rolling," Most diaper cakes will have about three layers, but you can do as few as one or two. If you can't find any pie pans, you can use other round, shallow containers—just make sure that the container is no more than half the diaper's height. This will make it easier to tie the diapers together later on.


You can use any sized pans you want, but for a standard cake, consider getting the following three sizes: 10 inch, 8 inch, and 6 inch (25.4 centimeters, 20.32 centimeters, 15.24 centimeters).;
, Put a stack of diapers inside the pan. Place them sideways, with the folded part facing outwards (towards the wall of the pan). Try to use size 0 or 1 diapers.

, Try to pack them as close together as you can. As you continue to fill the pan, you'll notice the diapers begin to swirl and curl within the pan. You may notice a gap or hole towards the center of the pan. Don't worry about the hole yet.


If your largest pan is 10 inches (25.4 centimeters), plan on using about 20 diapers., This will hold your diaper cake together. Do not use tape or glue, as this can ruin the diapers, and make them unusable for the new mom., Use the same process to make more layers. Each layer should be smaller than the last one. Remember to tie each diaper stack with a piece of string or a rubber band.


If your next two pans are 8 and 6 inches (20.32 15.24 centimeters), plan on using 13 and 7 diapers respectively., They will keep their shape because you tied them together, but you may still want to be careful. Set them down on a flat surface.

, Choose a ribbon whose color matches the cake's theme or the baby's gender. Cut a piece that is 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) longer than the circumference of your cake. Wrap the ribbon around the middle of the cake. Overlap the two ends by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Secure the two ends with a pin or a line of hot glue. Repeat for all of the stacks/layers.


Don't pin the ribbon directly to the diapers. Also, don't get any hot glue on the diapers.

, Try to keep them as centered as possible. If your stacks have a hole in the middle, use that as a guideline.

, The dowel should fit right through the center hole of each stack. If not, push the dowel through each layer carefully, so that you don't pierces the diapers.Try to find a dowel that can reach through all the layers, but without sticking over the top of the cake.


If you can't find a short enough dowel, don't worry. You can always cover the excess dowel up by tying soft toys around it.

, If you are having difficulties choosing decorations for your cake, as the new mom what the theme for her baby shower will be. Base your cake's theme off of that. If the mom does not have a theme yet, here are some popular themes that work well for babies:


Animals, especially zoo animals
Trains
Flowers and butterflies
Teddy bears
Oceans, such as whales and fish

, Soft and pastel colors are often associated with babies, so you might want to use those for your diaper cake. This does not mean that you have to use light blue for baby boys and pink for baby girls. There are other colors you can use too. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Match the colors to the baby shower's theme.
Use pastel primary colors, such as pink, pastel yellow, and light blue.
Try warm colors for a baby girl, or cool colors for a baby boy, but in pastel hues (so pink instead of red, and mint green instead of green).
Use yellow or purple if the baby's gender and the shower's theme are not yet known.

, Diapers are not the only thing a new mom will need and appreciate. There are lots of items babies need, and you could make the new mom really happy by including some of them in your cake. When picking out decorations, consider any of the following items:


Baby socks
Baby wipes
Bibs and burp cloths
Chew toys
Pacifiers
Rattles
Soft toys

, Just because you are making a cake out of diapers and baby items does not mean that your ""cake"" shouldn't resemble a real one. There are some details you can add that will give it the feel of a real cake. Here are some ideas to get you started:Find some baby barrettes or hair clips with rosettes or flowers on them, and clip them to the ribbons around your cake.
Wrap some rickrack around the ribbon bands to resemble frosting. Secure it with a drop of glue.
Cut shapes out of felt (or use baby-themed iron-on patches) to resemble fondant designs.

, Hot glue might be the most durable, but the new mom might appreciate a cake she can pull apart and use. Avoid gluing or pinning the decorations directly to the cake. Instead, consider any of the following:Slip thin items, such as baby wipes, behind the ribbons.
Stick pointy items, such as rattles, in between the diapers, so that they stick out like candles.
Pin soft items, such as bibs and teddy bears, to the ribbons. Be careful not to pierce the diapers themselves.
If the dowel was too long and sticks out of the top of the cake, consider tying some soft toys around it. This will hide the dowel and ensure that the cake topper of soft toys won't fall off.

, Every cake needs a cake topper, and soft toys are perfect for this. Use a few pins as possible. These pins will pierce the diapers, and possibly make them unusable.You can also use other items for the topper, such as baby bottles or other nice baby toys.

, Many arts and crafts stores sell decorated cardboard circles meant for cake bases. You can also use a pretty plate or cake strand instead.A cardboard circle or cake stand will also make the cake easier to move around.

Find out if they have a crush.,
Discuss romantic versus friendly feelings.,
Talk about handling rejection.",How to Handle Your Child's First Crush1," Children as young as elementary school age, and sometimes even preschoolers may decide they have a crush. Often, though, when children have their first crush, parents are the last to know. While some kids may share this exciting new with you first, more often they have already told their friends, siblings, and even their teacher by the time you find out. With a little investigating you can find out about their crush so that you can discuss it with them.For instance, you might notice that your child is spending more time focused on their appearance than they usually are.
Or, for example, you might notice that they get the giggles when you mention a specific classmate or a friend.
You can always ask your child, “Is there anyone that you might be interested in as more than a friend?”;
, When kids are forming friendships, they sometimes declare that they have a crush on someone without really understanding what romantic feelings are or what having a crush means. This can often happen between opposite sex friendships where children confuse liking someone as a friend with having a crush. Take some time to talk with your child about exactly what type of feelings they have for their crush. This may help them distinguish between liking someone as a platonic friend and having a crush.

For example, you might explain that when you have a crush on someone, you often want to spend more time around them. You might say, “When you have crush feelings, that person makes you feel happy just by being around.”
Be sure to normalize your child's feelings to keep them from getting embarrassed around their crush. Let them know that having a crush is totally normal and healthy.
If you are unsure how to approach this subject with your child, look online for age-appropriate video resources. These can sometimes be more comprehensive and more relatable.

, One of the difficult parts about having a crush, especially your first crush, is if the person doesn’t feel the same. When you talk to your child about their crush, take some time to find out how their crush feels about them. Discuss some of the ways to handle it appropriately if your child’s feelings aren’t reciprocated.For instance, you could say something like, “Have you told your crush how you feel? Do you plan on telling them?”
Or, you might explain, for example, “Sometimes you can have feelings about someone, but they don’t feel the same about you. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you. It just means the other person has different feelings, and that’s okay.”

Unfold the diapers, so they make a long rectangle.,
Wrap the diaper around the wreath.,
Add the rest of the diapers.,
Squish the diapers together.,
Add diapers until the entire ring is covered.,
Decorate the wreath with ribbons.,
Tie the ribbons around the diaper.,
Curl the ribbons one by one.








,
Finish the curl with a scissor.








,
Attach the gifts.,
Present the personal and handy gift to the mom-to-be!








",How to Make a Diaper Wreath," Don't unfold the wing parts, just unfold the main crease along the bottom.






;
, Wrap it so that the crease is towards the middle of the ring and the top of the diaper sticks out away from the middle.









Place a clear rubber band around the top of the diaper to secure it to the wreath. Don’t try to wrap it around multiple times, like you would for hair. Just once will do.

, There are two ways to do this:









Overlap each following diaper onto the previous diaper, to create a smooth, slightly swirled look for the end result. When you get to the final diaper, you will have to undo the elastic from the top of the first one, so that you can slide the last diaper underneath the edge.
Or...

, Squish each diaper up against the side of the previous one, making a bunched appearance.









While this looks a bit less finished, it does have the bonus of not having to do anything special for the final diaper.

, The overlap method is shown here.








,









Cut pieces of curling ribbon about 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) long.

, Take one of each color that you are using, and hold them together as though they are one piece of ribbon, then tie them around the top of a diaper, covering the hair elastics.








,,, Cut a few 20 inch (50.8 cm) long pieces of ribbon for them. Tie the ribbon around a diaper, leaving two long equal-length tails, and then tie those tails through or around your gift.









For a bottle, you’ll want to tie right below the ring that holds the nipple on. For a pacifier or toy keys, you’ll want to tie through the ring.
Also, leave a bit of slack between the diaper and any smaller gifts, so that they don’t disappear inside all the curls.

Talk about telling their crush how they feel.,
Discuss what’s okay for relationships at their age.,
Set boundaries.",How to Handle Your Child's First Crush2," Although your child may have their first crush, and while they might have told all of their friends about it, they may be unsure exactly how to tell their crush how they feel. You can help them by letting them know its okay if they don’t want to tell their crush. You can also help by giving them a few suggestions for how to talk to their crush.

You might tell your kindergartener with a crush on her older sibling’s friend, “It’s okay for you to have a crush on Sam and keep it a secret. Sometimes that’s how crushes are.”
Or, you might say, “When you tell your crush you like them, remember that you’re being brave by telling them.”

, Because this is a first crush, your child might not know exactly what to expect or do. Take the time to think about what types of interactions and relationships you’re okay with you child having. Then talk with your child about what crushes and relationships should look like for someone their age.You might start by explaining that their feelings are normal. You could say something like, “It’s okay for you to have these feelings and to want to be around your crush.”
You might also say, “At your age, I’m okay with you sitting next to your crush, holding their hand, and talking on the phone.”

, Although developing a crush is a normal occurrence for children, there should be guidelines and limits set on appropriate interactions between kids. Explain to your child what types of displays of affection are only for older kids, as well as what kinds are only okay for adults.For instance, you could explain to your preschooler, “Its okay for you to hold hands and sit by each other, but you aren’t allowed to kiss.”
Or, with a preteen, you might say, “You aren’t old enough yet to cuddle or kiss.”

"
"
Accept your child’s feelings.,
Give your child appropriate space.,
Trust your instincts.",How to Handle Your Child's First Crush3," One of the hardest parts of handling your child’s first crush, is accepting that your little one is growing up. Instead of resisting this natural part of your child’s development, accept that it’s happening and support your child through the process.

Talk to other parents about how they handled their child’s first crush in order to get ideas for how to cope with your child’s feelings.
Avoid telling your child that their feelings aren’t real or appropriate because you aren’t ready for them to have a crush.

, You may want to talk about your child’s crush every opportunity you have or supply them with tips on handling the crush. But you and your child will handle the crush better if you step back a bit and let your child experience their crush.Ask about their crush every now and then, but avoid interrogating them about it on a regular basis. They may get embarrassed, or even annoyed, and resist sharing anything with you.
Let them experience the course of the crush on their own. Although you may want to, you can’t control how they feel or how anyone else feels about them. Let them experience their crush without too much input so that it seems like a normal part of life rather than a big deal.

, While childhood crushes are a normal, and even frequent occurrence, you should also trust your gut and judgment if you feel something isn’t right about the situation. If you have any concerns about the nature or result of your child’s crush, you should strongly consider finding out more about the situation.

For instance, if you think your preteens’ crush on the neighbor is making him do things that break your rules, you should trust your instincts and address the situation.

Explain the need for wearing shoes.,
Build up to wearing shoes.,
Be enthusiastic.,
Set a good example.,
Set some ground rules.,
Allow your child to have a say in choosing his own shoes.,
Choose lightweight shoes.,
Select an appropriate brand.,
Make sure that the shoes are big enough.,
Observe your child walking in the shoes.,
Consider getting sandals.",How to Get Your Toddler to Wear Shoes," It's a good idea to take the time to explain to your toddler why he needs to wear shoes. Tell him that he's likely to hurt his toes or feet if he walks around in bare feet all the time.


Explain to him that walking around in bare feet might lead to stepping on sharp things like little bits of glass or stones. This could cut his feet.
Explain that shoes will protect his feet, keeping them warm and safe, especially when he is outdoors.;
, If your child is very resistant to wearing shoes, try building up to them slowly. Start by encouraging your child to wear slippers around the house while they're playing.


Start with lightweight slippers that the child will barely notice on their feet. Encourage them to wear these for an hour, then two hours and so on.
Once the child grows accustomed to the feeling of his feet being covered up, you can repeat the process again, but this time with shoes.

, You should present shoe wearing as a big event in the child's life, as something they should be proud of. Tell your child that since he's a big boy, he gets to wear big boy shoes.


Make a big deal of the child wearing shoes, and brag about how grown up he is to friends and family.
The child will be much more inclined to wear the shoes if he sees them as a fun, positive thing that earns him praise.

, If your child sees you walking around with no shoes on, they'll want to do the same. Set a good example by always wearing your shoes, especially outdoors.


Explain that the same rules apply to everyone, so if mom and dad are wearing shoes, he must wear them also.
You should also enforce this rule for any older siblings who the child looks up to.

, Once your child grows somewhat used to the shoes, you should set some firm ground rules. Tell your child that you expect them to keep their shoes on in certain situations, like when they go to the park, to the mall or for a walk outside.


If the child complains and attempts to remove their shoes during an outing, explain to them that big boys (or girls) have to wear their shoes, that only babies don't wear shoes and that babies have to stay at home.
When you're out at the playground or supermarket, point to other children who are wearing their shoes and say something like ""Look at that good girl over there wearing her shoes like her mommy told her.""

, Giving your child the opportunity to choose their own shoes (within reason) can help to make him a little more enthusiastic about wearing them.


Your child might also be more easily convinced to wear the shoes if they are brightly colored, have flashing lights or feature the child's favorite cartoon character.

, A lot of times, toddlers will refuse to wear shoes because they find them heavy and uncomfortable. Therefore, choosing lightweight, comfortable shoes made from a soft material is your best option.


Heavy, thick-soled shoes can prevent the child from moving normally, which can be off-putting.

, Not all brands of shoes are made to the same specifications, so a particular size in one brand of shoe will not be identical to the same size in another brand.


Toddlers have different types of feet - some are wide, some are narrow; some are flat, some have high-arches. Choose a shoe brand that suits your child's feet.
If you are unsure about what type of shoe is best for your child's feet, ask an experienced sales assistant at a good quality shoe store.

, It's important that the shoes are big enough for your toddler, otherwise he'll find them very uncomfortable.


When he tries a pair on, you should be able to fit your index finger between his heel and the back of the shoe, if you can't, the shoes are probably too small.
You should also check the width off the shoe - if the shoe is wide enough, you should be able to get it on your toddler's foot without too much effort or resistance.
You should also choose shoes that are easily adjusted, such as those with Velcro straps or belts.

, Try the shoes on in the store and observe your child as he walks. He should be moving naturally, without stumbling or walking in a strange manner.


Of course, new shoes always take a bit of getting used to, so if your toddler's walking is just a little exaggerated there's no need to worry too much.
Once you remove the shoes, check your child's feet for any marks, as this could indicate that the shoe was pinching his foot and is too small.

, If your child is used to running around barefoot, wearing sandals can help smooth the transition into wearing shoes.


Sandals will protect the child's feet and offer them more support, but they will also allow more air around the toddler's feet and allow him to wiggle his toes.
Once the child grows accustomed to wearing sandals, you can introduce him to real shoes.

Schedule active time for the day.,
Don't overdo the stimuli.,
Have them take a warm shower or bath before it's bedtime.,
Give your kids warm milk before they go to bed.,
Keep them occupied before they go to bed.,
Send them to bed a little early.,
If your children get out of bed after bedtime, bring them back to their bed.,
Schedule a time to open presents.,
Don't open presents until the designated time.",How to Get Your Kids to Sleep on Christmas Eve," Even if you're busy finalizing last-minute Christmas decorations or otherwise occupied, take the time out of your day to encourage your kids to exercise outdoors. Exercising will cause them to be sleepy and more subdued later on at night.


If you can't find the time to supervise them yourself, have a family member take up the responsibility, or even a friend. As long as the little ones get some exercise, you're doing good.
Go for a hike or walk outside. Pick a nice, scenic stretch of wilderness (if you can) to bring the kids, along with some play-toys and warm clothing. Spend an hour or two with the kids while they exert themselves.
Model snow-figures outside, if possible. In colder climes, snow-figures are the perfect excuse to be outside and get a little exercise. Make all kinds of different figures, from simple snowmen and snow-women to more elaborate figures, such as Star Wars characters, for example.;
, Christmas music, movies, books, and games all going on at once are bound to hype everybody up. You don't have to avoid these things altogether, but moderation is key.


Focus on doing one thing at a time. Don't have the music blaring if the kids are playing a game. Don't have the TV going if the kids are singing along to music.

, This will help them relax and get clean to boot.


Tell them you want them to be clean for Santa, especially since they exercised and got sweaty during the day.
Stick with your consistent bath-time routine. Whatever helps convince your children's brains that this is a normal day, even when they know it's not, will help them get to bed.

, This will help make make them sleepier, especially if combined with a snack.


Combine milk with some carbohydrates to produce the ideal bedtime snack.Milk contains tryptophan (also rich in Turkey, which is what is reputed to make Thanksgiving so yawn-inducing), and the carbs help produce insulin, which eventually encourages the brain to produce serotonin, or the ""calming hormone.""

, Read them a story or do some other quiet activity. It doesn't have to be Christmas-related.


Try introducing the kids to books. Books have the benefit of lasting as long as necessary, taking very little effort, and coming in a wide range of engaging stories with great characters.
Give your kids a massage or back-rub if they've been good. As a precondition, make them be completely ready for bed, so that when you lull their little bodies into a state of near-complete relaxation, you won't have to wake them to brush their teeth or wash their face.
Close the curtains, keep the door shut, and lower the ambient noise coming from outside. If you and the rest of the family is quiet or subdued, that's a sign to the kids that they should be going to sleep.

, Most kids are going to stay up for a while even if they're really relaxed. That's fine. It's Christmas and they're entitled to. Eventually, they will fall asleep.


Take this example: John stays up for around an hour before he finally falls asleep on Christmas Eve. If he normally goes to bed at eight-thirty, put him to bed at 8. This way, he'll stay up until nine—only half an hour after he normally goes to bed.

, Give them suggestions of something to think about. Try not to make it Christmas-related. You can suggest counting sheep, trying to relax every muscle in their body, or being Superman. Focusing on these can help keep their minds off of Christmas.


If your kids are really having trouble sleeping, you can try lying/cuddling with them for a while. Seeing you relaxed and ready to sleep will help put your children in the right mindset.
Don't let the children sleep together unless they normally do. Children who sleep in the same room will be more eager to talk with one another, providing stimulus that could keep them awake.
Remind them that Santa can't come unless they're asleep.

, This will keep your kids from springing out of bed at 4 AM. 6:30 AM to 8 AM is a good time frame.

, Give your kids positive reinforcement if they stayed in bed for a while. This will better the chances of the same thing happening next year.

Make quiet time a part of your daily routine.,
Create a unique place for each child.,
Get sound machines, or use an app.,
Incentivize quiet time.,
Be patient and consistent.",How to Get Your Kids to Give You Quiet Time1," The most effective method for ensuring that your kids value your quiet time is by implementing it into your daily life. Rather than making quiet time something that’s just for parents, stress the importance of it being a family practice.


Some parents make the mistake of only implementing quiet time when they are already burnt out. Then, for the kids, it becomes a punishment. Instead, schedule quiet time into the day—even on weekends—so that it becomes an appreciated staple in your household.;
, Children are more likely to like and appreciate quiet time when the experience includes a treasured place of their own. When they can go somewhere special to be creative, relax, or play, they may start to enjoy periods of quiet.Make a small, age-appropriate niche for each child to go to. It can be a work/play area in their bedroom or a designated zone in the household.
To ensure that each child takes advantage of actually being quiet, avoid overlapping spaces. It’s hard for kids to be quiet when they are in a shared space.

, Younger children may have a hard time complying with quiet time rules. You can make it easier for them by getting sound machines that produce white noise or relaxing sounds such as flowing water or chirping birds. Placing these devices in the quiet time zone makes it hard for children to be distracted by outside noises and promotes individual play or rest.If you are not interested in investing in sound devices, there are various apps you can download on smart phones that play white noise or ambient sounds. Browse your app store to check out options.

, To establish a quiet time routine, it may help to start with positive reinforcement. Provide some sort of incentive for each child remaining in their zone and respecting others' quiet time.


For example, you might schedule each day’s quiet time before snack time. That way, you can say, “Let’s have 30 minutes of quiet in our zones. Then, we’ll go in the kitchen for a yummy snack.” You may like to use age appropriate language.
Creating an incentive around quiet time increases the likelihood of your kids complying and feeling positive about this activity., If you are just now implementing a quiet time into your family’s routine, give it some time. Early on, your children may be confused about what quiet time means or think it’s a one-time thing. Avoid dropping the habit because they are not consistently compliant initially.


Exercise patience and stick with it. Over time, when they see you modeling appropriate behaviors and rewarding them for obedience, they will pick up the habit.
Your children may also pick up the habit more easily when quiet time is expected. Schedule it at the same time each day so that it becomes a regular part of their routine.

Notice signs of anxiety.,
Prepare people before meeting your baby.,
Introduce new people in a familiar environment.,
Ask for some time before picking up the baby.,
Do a gradual introduction.",How to Handle Your Baby's Stranger Anxiety1," Signs of stranger anxiety can begin as early as four months. Some babies may go quiet or look at the stranger with fear. Others may become clingy or bury themselves in you. Some children begin to cry, scream, or become fussy.If you notice your baby having similar symptoms, it may be the beginnings of stranger anxiety and separation anxiety.;
, Let your friends and family know that your baby is afraid of strangers and may need some time to warm up. Tell them not to move too aggressively and to respect your baby’s personal space.Let them know to follow the baby’s lead and not to rush their introduction.


Keep in mind that your baby will probably show fewer signs of stranger anxiety around people who are not strangers and who they spend a lot of time around, such as family members and close friends.
It can be difficult from grandparents or aunts and uncles to be patient, but remind them that it’s important for the baby to feel comfortable around them. Say, “My baby will grow to love you, but right now she needs some time as meeting new people can be scary. Please give her the space she needs until she can warm up to you.”

, Have friends and family members come to your home to meet your child so that your baby is in a comfortable and familiar environment. If your baby meets strangers outside of the home, hold your baby when introducing and don’t immediately give the baby over to be held.Having a favorite toy or blanket can also help your baby feel more comfortable with a stranger.

, Ask people to wait a bit before picking up the baby. Babies tend to be more relaxed when people approach slowly and calmly and don't rush to pick up the baby.Let your baby feel comfortable before making contact with another person.


While many people are excited to pick up a baby, say, “My baby is a bit nervous around strangers. She’ll respond better if you give her time to adjust to you.”

, If your baby struggles to adjust to new people, try doing a gradual introduction. For example, introduce your baby to the person one day. On the next day, have your baby notice or interact with the person for a few minutes. Increase the length of time your baby spends with the person so that they can warm up gradually.


Be patient in introducing people to your child. Take it slow and find a method that works for them."

Enforce a routine.,
Adjust their sleep schedule.,
Get organized.,
Be encouraging during the wake-up process itself.,
Try moving breakfast to the car.,
Remove the arguments over clothes.,
Let them experience consequences for being stubborn.",How to Get Your Children up in the Morning," The most important thing for getting a child up and out of the house as quickly as possible in the morning is to make whatever you do a routine. The child should be able to expect exactly what will happen and when. They should be able to do things in the exact same order that they are used to doing them in. This will keep them focused on what they’re doing and reduce the resistance that they put up.


If your child is old enough to talk, get them involved in planning the routine. Ask them about what they need to do in the morning and how they think they should get ready. This should open them up to the idea of a routine.;
, One way to make your mornings less rushed is to adjust your child’s sleeping schedule. Put them to sleep earlier and wake them up earlier. This will buy you extra time in the morning so that you can more easily get them ready.


You can also try getting them up later and move your wake-up time a little earlier. This will allow you to get completely ready before they even wake up. Then you can completely focus on keeping the on track and helping them through their own morning routine.
Keep in mind that kids need more sleep than adults. Kids should get at least 10 hours of sleep until they reach age 12.After age 12, they can be gradually reduced to an adult-style sleep schedule.

, Organization is your best friend when it comes to getting your kids out the door in the morning. The more organized you are, the less you’ll be running around like a chicken with your head cut off. One great time-saver is to start getting as many things ready the night before. This lets you just grab items and go and also cuts down on forgotten items. Prepare backpacks with all homework and books, lunchboxes, breakfast, shoes and coats before bed and have them waiting at the door (with food items in the fridge).


Making a checklist can help a lot too. Put a big list on the front door of all of the standard things that everyone needs to do to get ready in the morning. Add a white board where people can write down special items that are outside the norm (like a class project or extra diapers).

, However well-prepared your child is, waking up can be difficult, especially if your child is getting used to a newly enforced routine. When it comes to your actual ""first contact"" in the morning, try a variety of techniques to see what your child responds to best:


Set an alarm clock. It should have a noticeable ring, but not deafening. Set it for the time they need to get up and put it by their bed.
Shake them a bit and say, ""Rise and shine. Time to get up!"" or something like that. Use their name and mention something specific (and ideally fun) that is going to happen that day, like an activity in a particular class.
Turn on a television or a radio loud enough that the talk will interrupt their sleep (but not so loud that its going to hurt their ears or annoy the neighbors).
Flick the lights on and off a few times (maybe even to the tune of a song).
Pull the cover off of them. Help them out of bed, gently.
Remind them about breakfast. Say ""breakfast is on the table,"" and if possible offer a desired food.

, Your kids need to eat breakfast but if your morning rush makes it hard to get them fed in time, try moving eating breakfast to the car. This will force them to sit still while they eat and also buy you more time in the morning. Just make sure to choose foods that are healthy and travel-friendly.


Try a piece of whole grain toast spread with a light amount of peanut butter (to avoid drips). Place dried apricots on one side and then fold into a half-sandwich. Serve it to them with a to-go cup of low-fat milk.
Another good breakfast option is the all-in-one muffin. Add small chunks of scrambled egg, cooked bacon, and shreds of cheese to any cornbread muffin mix. Bake as directed. These are easy to just grab on the way out of the house if you make a batch for the whole week each Sunday.

, A huge time sink in getting your child ready in the morning is the battle over what to wear. There are two ways to deal with this. If your child is older, simply move the choosing of the day’s outfit to the night before. Have them pick out what they’re going to wear just before bedtime and enforce wearing that outfit when it’s time to get dressed. If you have a younger child, give them the choice between two options in what they wear when you’re getting them dressed (the “choice” should cut down on arguments). Don’t bend and give them any third option: they’re looking to gain the upper hand and control the situation so you need to communicate that that’s not going to happen.


You can also let small children throw together whatever crazy outfit they want to put on. Stipulate only that it has to be appropriate to the weather.

, Your toddler doesn’t want to put on their coat. Your 10 year old doesn’t want to eat breakfast. These are the common battles of every parent trying to get out of the house in the morning. Instead of wasting a bunch of time fighting your child, let them experience consequences for these bad choices. A little cold and a little hunger won’t hurt them, but it will help them learn that they suffer when they don’t do these basic things.


For example, let’s say your four year old doesn’t want to put on his shoes in the morning. Let him walk out to the car without his shoes (sneaking an extra pair of socks into your purse). His feet will get wet and he’ll be upset, very quickly learning that it’s better to put shoes on the suffer through the usual morning car ride with wet, cold feet.

Have books at the ready.,
Set up art stations.,
Promote imaginative play.,
Work on puzzles.",How to Get Your Kids to Give You Quiet Time2," One of the best ways to spend quiet time for children is by practicing their reading skills. Depending on your children’s age, supply appropriate books for them to look at and read during this time period. Colouring books are worth considering for those not comfortable reading alone.


In addition to being a “quiet” activity, reading helps children develop strong vocabulary and offers cognitive stimulation.
If you have sound machines in each zone, children that read aloud are less likely to disturb other’s quiet., Quiet time can be a wonderful opportunity to exercise creativity. Stock each child’s quiet zone with materials that allow them to make art. Talk to each child to determine what medium they enjoy working with best.


For example, your child might enjoy using their quiet time to weave friendship bracelets. Another child might use this time to sculpt with modelling clay or paint watercolor pictures., Good old-fashioned play with dolls, trains, and action figures is healthy for your children. In the digital age, children spend an inordinate amount of time on technological devices. While these devices may be used in your home at other times, restrict quiet time activities to non-electrical toys to stimulate your children’s imaginations., Strategy and analysis are important skills for kids to develop, these are a great way to build these skills. Working on puzzles helps younger children develop fine motor skills through circling with word-find or turning a piece with a physical puzzle. In addition, all children receive enhanced cognitive skills by thinking through problems and devising the right answer.


Supply your children’s quiet zones with crossword puzzles, word search puzzles, and puzzle sets, jigsaws etc that allow them to develop these much-needed skills."

Make naps non-negotiable for smaller children.,
Maintain a consistent bedtime routine.,
Allow individual quiet time before bed.,
Discourage them from being out of bed after bedtime.",How to Get Your Kids to Give You Quiet Time3," Naptime is essential to healthy child development. Toddlers and younger children under the age of 5 should be getting at least an hour nap daily. Plus, scheduling this rest period around the same time each day helps your child’s internal body clock. Sticking to a consistent naptime helps them fall asleep easier and rest better.


For older children, you can make naptime optional—they can either take a nap or work/play quietly in their respective zones., Waking up and going to bed at the same times each day help your children fall asleep at night faster. What’s more, when your children have a usual bedtime, you are more likely to receive a bonus period of quiet time each night after they’ve gone down.


Help your children adjust to a bedtime by creating a soothing, wind-down ritual each night. They will be in the mood for a restful night’s sleep after doing relaxing activities like taking a bath and reading a story., Older children may have a slightly later bedtime than their younger siblings, but you can still take advantage of some extra quiet time by getting them in their respective rooms before lights out. During this short period, they may read quietly or engage in non-stimulating play before bed.


Switching from stimulating activities like watching TV to trying to get your kids ready for bed can be a challenge. This evening period of quiet time can be the perfect transition to help them calm down before tucking them in for the night., You can protect your own nightly quiet time by ensuring your children aren’t popping out of bed every five minutes to use the potty or get a sip of water. Being firm with bedtime rules can help your children develop better sleep routines.


You can decrease a power struggle about bedtime or late-night visits by making the wind-down routine more pleasant for your children. Add bubble bath to their nighttime soak. Read to them before lights out. Or, give them a few minutes to work on a puzzle or play with a favorite stuffed animal.
In addition, you can also promote positive bedtime behaviors by coming up with incentives. Create a rewards chart where you give each child a sticker or star for good behavior at night. Once they reach a certain number, give them a special treat like extra time during the day for a favorite activity. "

Act warmly.,
Spend time with your baby and the stranger together.,
Schedule a new babysitter after naps and feeding.,
Avoid stalling, even if your baby is upset.",How to Handle Your Baby's Stranger Anxiety2," Your baby will take cues from you and your behavior. If you act distant or nervous around someone, your baby may interpret your actions and also be fearful of the person.Treat people familiar to you but unfamiliar to your baby warmly. Show your child that you feel comfortable with the person and your baby should feel comfortable, too.


Offer hugs, smiles, and other social behavior so that your baby interprets the person as safe.

, To help your baby adjust, spend time altogether when first introduced.If your child is upset, move your child closer to you and further from the stranger, then try again later. Create a safe and comfortable environment for your child.


Have the person hold something your child is interested in and have your baby move toward the object and the person.

, Have all of your baby’s needs taken care of prior to meeting someone new. Babies tend to be more anxious if they are tired or hungry.Have the diaper changed, baby fed and freshly napped before making big changes.


Your baby should feel happy and be in a good mood for a good transition.

, It can be difficult to see your child cry and be upset with someone new. However, hanging around and waiting for your baby to settle may cause confusion and more upset. Once you have taken the time you need to introduce your baby to the caregiver and help the baby feel comfortable, let your child know you are leaving and then go."

Attend meet the teacher events.,
Schedule play-dates before the school year starts.,
Create a checklist for materials.,
Learn the route to the classroom.,
Select a cool outfit to wear on the first day.",How to Handle Your Child's Back‐to‐School Worries1," One of the biggest concerns of many children leading up to a new school years is “Will my teacher like me?” Meet this worry head-on by taking the opportunity for your child to become acquainted with their teacher and/or aide before heading to class on the first day.


Many schools host yearly “Meet the Teacher” events that allow parents and children to visit the school and meet the faculty. During this event, your child may have the chance to be introduced to the principal, teachers, aides, and other students as well.
If your child is feeling nervous or shy, facilitate a conversation between your child and their teacher. Help the teacher get to know your child. You might say, ""Mrs. Hanson, this is Joey. This summer we read The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, and it's his new favorite book.""
This is also a good time to privately inform teachers about any special accommodations, illnesses, or allergies your child has.You may also quietly mention to the teacher that your child has been having fears.;
, If you are already familiar with other families at your child’s school, it can be a great idea to schedule a few end-of-summer play-dates for your worrisome children. Another common fear is not having any friends upon arriving on the first day. Dusting off their socialization skills before the school year starts can help your child get reacquainted with old friends and introduced to new ones.


Reach out to parents in your community or neighborhood with same-age children. Plan an end-of-summer picnic or barbecue to encourage whole families to come together.
If you aren’t familiar with any local families, attending meet the teacher events hosted by your school can provide an occasion to talk to other parents and set up play-dates. If you see another child who’s soon to be your kid’s classmates, say to the parent, “It looks like our kids will be in the same class. Why don’t we all go out for ice cream this weekend? I would love for Zoe to have a friend on the first day.”Don't be alarmed if they don't hit it off right away. Your child will feel better simply knowing someone who will be in their class.

, Worrying over school supplies and supplies to make lunches is yet another concern of kids heading back to school. Get the supply lists for each of your children’s respective grades and plan a day out for shopping. Do this far enough in advance to alleviate worries, such as stores being out of the necessary supplies.Use this opportunity to start building excitement around going back to school. Tell your kids, “Okay, kids, on Saturday we will go out for back to school shopping and lunch. I want to make sure you all have everything you need for a fun and productive school year!”

, Getting lost on the first day of school is probably a fear that tops most kids’ lists. As a parent, it’s easy to assume this is a concern inherent to small kids only — it’s not. Even older kids in high school can be overcome by nerves that make them forget the way. Don’t make a big deal about it, but ease everyone’s fears by taking the route beforehand.


Walking, biking, or in a car, take the route your children will use before the big day. Once at the school, make sure each child is confident about how to get to their individual classrooms.
Finding classrooms is also a concern that can be alleviated by attending back to school events like meet the teacher.Rehearse the route from the parking lot to the classroom, as your child may not want you accompanying them on their first day.

, Every kid needs their own “armor” when facing the prospect of heading back to school. Help your kid gain the courage to take on a new year by purchasing or planning a favorite outfit to wear on the big day.


It may even be fun to refer to the back to school outfit as “armor” with your kids. If you know one of your kids is frightened about going back to school, say, “Let’s choose some armor to help you feel brave on your first day back, okay?”
This may be especially important to older kids in junior high or high school. Kids at this age start to care more about what their peers think. Having a cool outfit to wear can help them feel courageous when entering a more socially-driven school environment.

Encourage your child to talk about anxiety.,
Role-play anxiety-inducing scenarios.,
Avoid blanket reassurance statements — empathize.,
See the school’s guidance counselor.,
Re-establish routine.",How to Handle Your Child's Back‐to‐School Worries2," To kids, parents are strong, courageous, and have it all figured out. This impression can cause your kids to stay tight-lipped about their back to school worries. If you notice your child showing signs of anxiety, such as trouble going to sleep, clinginess or fear of being alone, tearfulness, or they are simply less-than-enthusiastic about the first day, start a discussion.You might say, “Robbie, I noticed you don’t seem as excited about the first day of school as your sister. When I went to high school, I was really nervous about making new friends when I went back to school. Do you feel that way this year?”
Sharing your own experience may help your child to realize that their fears are common. As a result, they might be more willing to open up about any worries they have.

, If your child is feeling stressed out about going back to school, it may help to get some practice. Help your child pinpoint what’s causing them anxiety and act out scenarios to ease their anxiety.


For example, if your child knows they will have to introduce themselves in front of the class on the first day, they may be worried about embarrassing themselves. Let them practice what they will say, then praise them for their efforts., Never diminish your child’s fears with false reassurances. Saying, “Oh, you’ll be fine,” or, “There’s nothing to worry about,” won’t make your child’s stress disappear. It will make them less likely to talk to you about anxiety in the future.Even though it may seem trivial to you, your child’s fear is real. Give it your full attention by talking it over, explaining how these fears are very common, and helping your child brainstorm ways to cope with their worries.
Sit down or kneel to their level, look them in the eye, and touch them reassuringly so as to indicate active listening and provide some comfort.

, Sometimes, having an ally at the school is enough to help your child defeat back to school stress. In addition to meeting the teacher, getting acquainted with the school counselor may help your child feel better.


You might explain to the school counselor that your child is a bit reluctant to return to school. Then, let your child know, “Sarah, if you’re ever feeling worried or nervous at school, you can come and talk to Ms. Timms. She’ll help you work through your anxiety.”, Re-creating the school day routine can help ease your child back into the swing of things. It may be practical to start waking your child — or setting an alarm clock — a few weeks before the first day and letting them get ready like they would for a typical day. In the same vein, get your child settled into bed at an earlier time, too.


It can also be helpful to start having them lay out clothes the night before, making lunches (for older kids), and reviewing old homework or worksheets to get back into the school mindset."

Teach your child positive visualization.,
Try deep breathing.,
Come up with a reassuring mantra.",How to Handle Your Child's Back‐to‐School Worries3," Imagining a successful first day can be a powerful tool to help your child battle back to school anxiety. Instruct your child on how to perform visualization and have them practice this exercise nightly leading up to the first day of school.


For example, you might say, “Close your eyes and imagine the first day of school being absolutely perfect. You are wearing your best outfit. You have a tasty lunch packed in your bag. You walk to your classroom with your best pal beside you. Your teacher has a bright smile and welcomes you to class.” Walking through this exercise can help alleviate fears and empower your child to make the first day great.Remind them that their day may not go exactly like they envisioned, but that is okay. It can be different and still be a great day.

, Breathing deeply is a technique that jumpstarts the body’s stress response. Taking slow, controlled breaths can help your child fight rising anxiety as they attend school on the first day. Teach this exercise as the summer comes to a close, and remind your child that they can practice deep breathing anytime at school.The 4-7-8 approach is easy for young minds to remember. Simply breathe in through the nose deeply to a count of four. Hold the breath for seven counts. Then, exhale through the mouth for eight counts. Repeat as necessary.

, Arm your child with powerful phrases that help them feel courageous in the face of back to school stress. Repeating positive mantras or affirmations can trick your child’s brain into thinking they feel confidence until they actually do.Try having them repeat their mantra on the way to school to help them get pumped up for a great day.


Try: “I am in control of my fear,” “This school year will be a great one,” or “Starting a new school year can be scary, but I am brave.”
Remind your child that they can use these mantras any point during the day should they become nervous. They can repeat them silently to themselves, or go to the bathroom and say them quietly in private.

Take a deep breath.,
As her body begins to change, she may be scared or vulnerable to how society views the ideal woman.,
She is trying to figure out who she is and to become self-reliant.,
Don't tell her that she shouldn't put any emphasis on her physical appearance.,
These days, children are pushed to grow up fast, which can hinder the process of your tween trying on different selves as a way of finding out who she is.,
Her friends and relationships are very important to her.,
Boys will start being of interest to her.,
Read!",How to Guide Your Tween Daughter As a Father,";
, Don't let her buy into how the media portray the ideal woman. Body image issues are huge for girls. Talk to her about it, and don't be critical of the changes in her body and the awkwardness that may result. Refrain from making comments about her weight or body. Be active with her. Make sure she is eating a balanced diet of food. Don't let the tragedy of sexual abuse in families stop you from showing her affection. If she doesn't get it from you, she'll get it somewhere else.

, The changes in hormones make her feel things more intensely, so she may seem more emotionally immature. She is more sensitive to body language than boys, she's more relational, she notices things in more detail, she sees the big picture, she expresses her feelings more often, etc. She is, after all, a mini-woman, and the same things apply to her as they do to an adult woman. So, dad: Don't tease her excessively, and be sensitive to what you're teasing her about. Don't lecture her; listen to her and ask her questions. She wants your attention. Respect the differences between you and her and respect and validate her opinions. Keep clear limits and let her know the consequences if she crosses a line.

, You are the one who reassures her that she is becoming beautiful. Make sure she knows that you care about her appearance. If you say nothing, that will send a message too. Help her to be balanced in her approach to her appearance. But, don't let her rely on charm to manipulate you.

, In this process, she needs you to be there. Schedule regular times to be just with her. Don't just crash in front of the TV and forget everything else. Teach her things that will make her confident and independent. Avoid pushing her into activities she doesn't like. Give her lots of positive feedback.

, Know what effect her relationships are having on her. Get acquainted with her friends. Talk to her about her friendships, especially if she comes to you with a problem. Be aware of bullying and the signs that she may be the object of it.

, She may treat them with disdain one day and like them the next. Make sure she's not being pushed into something no 10 or 11 year old should be pushed into. Show an interest in where she's at with boys. Help her understand the male perspective. Show her how she should expect to be treated by a man. This is huge. How you treat your wife and other women will tell your daughter a lot. She's watching, by the way. You set the standard. Do you measure up?

, This would be a great way to earn money on a warm, summer day! Set up the bucket with soapy water, get some rags out, and have a water hose near by.

, Let them help grandma when she's planting her flowers or have them rake up the leaves during autumn. Since you're dealing with kids, you don't want to give them anything potentially dangerous to do; You couldn't let a 7 year old cut down branches or mow the lawn.

Be aware of how vulnerable your child is feeling when they are left alone in bed.,
Understand why it's important for your child to sleep in their own bed.,
Think about any fears or anxieties around bedtime your child might have.,
Have your child use action figures or dolls to act out their fears and anxieties around bedtime.,
Give them some “protectors” to help them get through the night.,

Put your child back in their bed if they sneak out into yours.,
Ensure the door to their room stays closed throughout the night.,
Be patient and make small adjustments to their sleeping habits until they get used to their new bed.",How to Get Your Child to Sleep in Their Own Bed," Children from 6 to 15 months of age often cry and refuse to go to anyone other than a parent - referred to as ""stranger anxiety”.So when a young child wakes in the middle of the night, they will automatically search the room for a parent as they are feeling vulnerable and alone.


This creates a cycle where the child cries if they are alone in their room and cannot locate a parent. If you then go and check on your child, you now have to deal with an awake and crying child.Keep in mind there is nothing wrong with parents who cannot get their child to sleep through the night in their own bed. Sleep is a flexible behavior, and it is very normal for children to look for their parents if they wake up at night.;
, There are many benefits to weaning your child from your bed, as it teaches your child about boundaries, it allow them to gain their own space, and it nurtures their self-confidence and independence.Young children are not born with self control, it is something they have to learn from their parents. Remember that it is okay and normal for children to cry. In fact, it is often unavoidable if they are going to learn to control their behavior.
As a parent, it's important for you to be firm and persistent about self control in your child, especially when it comes to sleeping arrangements. If you constantly soften and give in to your child's crying and protests, your child learns that if they cry long enough they will get want they want., There are many different reasons why your child is not comfortable in their own bed and it can be hard, when confronted with an upset child, to figure out what's going on instead of just letting them sleep in with you. It's worth exploring a few of the more common issues:Are they afraid of things that go bump in the night or monsters under the bed or in the closet?
Are they jealous of a younger sibling and feel that this is the only way to get the attention that they want?
Are there sounds they can hear that disturb them?
Is their room too dark and in need of a night light?

, You can also have your child draw or paint their anxieties around bedtime on a piece of paper.Give your child lots of time to open up and don't react negatively if they say something you don't want to hear. It's best to determine what exactly is causing them to react badly to sleeping in their own bed.

, Their favorite toy or a fluffy stuffed animal can be comforts and protectors against any ""monsters"" or shadows in your child's room.Another great way to help your child feel safe and protected is to let different stuffed animals represent different members of their family, so sleeping with a certain bear or toy can be just like sleeping with Mom or Dad.
You can also record a tape of you reading child's favorite songs and stories so they can turn it on when they feel alone or need comfort., These can also go a long way toward banishing night terrors. For some children, the dark can turn a familiar room into a place that is very scary, and having a light that comes on in the dark can be instrumental to making the room seem friendly again.


You can also give them a flashlight that they can keep by their bed or play with before bed so they feel like they are in control and can't get scared by things they cannot see in the dark., This will allow them to shoot monsters with the spray if they come out of the closet or under the bed.You can also move the furniture around in your child's room to eliminate any large shadows or spooky corners in their room.

, You can then put duct tape over the minutes and ask your child to tell you the number they see in the dark. Indicate to them the numbers that correspond with sleepy time, such as no one is awake in your home after 8 pm and no one should be awake before 5 am., As a compromise, you could allow your child to sleep in your room, but rather than in your bed, have them sleep in a tent or ""camp"" out in your room.Set up a kid's tent at the foot of your bed and let your child ""camp"" every night. Then, slowly move the tent out of your room and into your child's room.
Allow your child to sleep in the tent in their room every night, but move your child's bedding and stuffed animals into their bed. Eventually, your child should avoid the hassle of moving all their sleep stuff back into the tent and just stay in their bed.

, Start talking to your child about what they should expect at bedtime (in their own bed, in their own room, with a nice long sleep throughout the night) in the afternoon, so your child will know what to expect by lights-out., Some children need to be wound down slowly and putting them to bed before they are completely calmed down can lead to a sleepless night for them, and for you. Having a consistent bedtime ritual will indicate it is time for them to go to sleep and they will be in the right frame of mind for bed.


Your ritual could be giving them a bath and then reading them a story or singing them a song before bed.You could also make your child a ""sleepytime book"", nothing fancy, just a few pages stapled together that your child can color or look at before bed. It could tell a story about sleeping well in a new bed or new home, and encourage your child to recognize the value of sleeping in their own bed., If your child has a hard time falling asleep without your presence, withdraw yourself gradually. Sit on their bed and after a few days, switch to sitting in a chair a few feet from their bed. Then, over time, move the chair closer to the doorway of your child's room and/or into the hallway.Avoid talking to your child as you sit with them until they fall asleep. The idea is to bore them into slumber, not stimulate them., Reward each night your child spends in their own bed with a sticker, and after a full week of sleeping in their own room, tell them they win a prize like a special outing or a new set of pyjamas.You could also create a toy-ticket program to stop your child from sneaking into your bed. If your child sleeps for several consecutive nights in their own bed, they can win tickets to trade in for new toys or a playdate., Instruct your child to close their eyes and think about what they want for their birthday or what their day at school is going to be like tomorrow. Giving your child something to think about is a great tool to help them fall back asleep., Most sleep consultants and parents who've been there say that once you decide to start training your child to sleep in their own bed, bed sharing needs to end entirely. Each time your child gets out of bed, carry them back and calmly place them in their bed.Avoid yelling or nagging them as you do this. Your child will realize that they are not getting your attention, even negative attention, and this can cut down on their night-time wanderings from bed., While it doesn't need to be locked, closing the door to your child's room will ensure they are not woken up by any noise in the hallway or other rooms in the house, and they will be less distracted as they try to fall asleep., It may not be reasonable to demand that a child who's accustomed to sleeping in their parent's bed suddenly has to stay in their own room all night. So try making the separation more gradual.If your child began by sleeping in a crib in a separate room, you may have an easier time with gradually moving out of their room as they sleep.But if they began by sleeping in your bed with you, every night, you may need to put a comforter or air mattress on the floor and sleep in their room with them for a few nights until they get used to sleeping in their own bed."

Fix breakfast for the kids.,
Get the kids up and going in the order that makes sense for your family.,
Get everyone out of the house promptly after breakfast and any last minute bathroom needs.",How to Get Small Children Out of the House in the Morning," Things with children almost always take longer than you plan; a little extra time goes a long way to making your morning more enjoyable.;
, Once young children are awake, they need attention right away; giving them that attention will be stressful if you still have a lot to do for yourself.


Enjoy a cup of coffee, take a shower, and spend a few minutes on yourself. You'll be much more prepared for the kids. A few minutes less sleep pays great dividends in time to get yourself ready and organized.
Gather your stuff for the day, too. You'll be less likely to forget something important if you do this when it's quiet.

, If your kids are too young to help with breakfast, it's a good idea to get their breakfasts together before you get them up.


Some breakfast foods such as quiches and frittatas are easy to cook the night before, and can provide breakfast for several days. These can be a great way for you to provide a quick and nutritious breakfast.
Avoid foods that your kids tend to make messes with. If cereal always gets spilled, find another option. When time is tight, it can be really frustrating to clean up a mess – it's not good for you or your kids when this happens, and it's easily avoided.

, Depending upon the ages you're dealing with, it might be easier to get everyone up at the same time. Or it might be easier to wake up and feed and change a baby, then get the toddler going. Experiment with what works best.


Try to get everyone ready and dressed before breakfast. Going back and forth costs time and offers lots of opportunities for young ones to get distracted and stall.

, It's a good plan not to turn on the TV or break out phones or tablets; these all have a way of turning into to big time-wasters.

When they shrug, don't respond or ignore you, try asking if they did anything interesting. There's a big difference between ""Things"" at school and ""Interesting Things"" at school. ""What was your favorite thing that happened at school today?"" is a good question to get some conversation going.;
, Whenever your youngster brings home homework or a reading book, help them out. This will not only teach them valuable skills, but it can also boost your relationship with one another. Whilst helping, ask your child simple questions such as ""Have you been enjoying ?"" Children may be struggling with the subject, so try to help them and ask them to pay attention in class.

, School is for learning and building skills, but it's also a place to make new friends, blossom your creativity and improve social skills. Teach your child what else school can be used for, that they should respect school rules (unless you have a problem with them), and to respect school property and keep it tidy.

, Find out what you can do to help your child at home. Let the teacher know when you have concerns. Let the teacher know you appreciate his or her efforts when appropriate.

, Open house, conferences, volunteer in the classroom, and attend all school functions if possible. This lets your child know that school is important.

, This method is recommended since the clothes usually come into groups or sets and will come with images. Craigslist is also nice because you can also look for toys and other baby or child needs.

, As little as $5 for a clothes set, there's always a bin dedicated for kid's clothes at a family garage sale. They might only have clothes pertaining to the gender of their child or children (girl or boy) and have selective sizes.

, Baby showers helps a lot in the first few months of taking care of your little one. Reuse blankets as your child grows up. Store washcloths in a drawer to use as rags.

Utilize online tools.",How to Get Children to Save Money," Beginning as early as 3-5 years of age, children can start to learn the rudiments of saving money and using coupons is a great way to do that. They can earn coupons for things like helping, for being cooperative, for clearing their plate – the possibilities are endless. They can then save those coupons and exchange them for fun things to do. This is a great first lesson in saving.For instance, you can let them watch a thirty-minute cartoon for 1 coupon. To watch an animated movie they might need 4 coupons. Or 10 coupons gets them a trip to get pizza.
By building rewards that need to be worked toward, you teach them saving and the value of working toward a goal without them even knowing it’s happening. It becomes ingrained.;
, Label each jar with a different label: savings, spending, and sharing. This will allow them to see how money can be managed for the things they want as well as for helping others. Every time they get some money, divide it evenly between all three jars.The savings jar is for bigger things they want. Maybe it’s a toy or a video game or an expensive computer game. Have them set a goal for what it is they want and then work toward it.
Use the spending jar for little things, like stickers or gum or maybe an ice cream cone.
Sharing is a jar to use to help teach them about giving back. It could be to get a gift for a friend “just because”, or maybe to donate to the local shelter or food bank.

, It can be as big or as small as you want it to be. Every time you come home and have spare change, toss it in the jar. Encourage your child to do the same.


Every time you see change on the ground you should pick it up for the jar as well. Your child will start to do the same.
Once the jar is full you can make more fun of it. For instance, divide the total for different purposes: half goes into their bank account, half buys pizza for a movie night.

, Using a debit or credit card is too abstract for little ones so paying with a card fails to teach them anything. If, however, you have them put those coins in the slot, they see them go away and realize what it means to spend money at a parking meter and that it is not free., There are age-specific games on the internet that can help children of all ages learn about money. You have to admit, it’s probably more fun to learn from Elmo than boring old mom and dad.

, Generally speaking, the age range for beginning an allowance can be as early as three since studies show children that young can grasp the concept of cash and purchasing with it. Most parents, however, start a little later, such as 6 or 7 years of age.There are several different schools of thought on this, but in general parents provide allowances that average between $.50 – 1.00 per week multiplied by their age. Hence a 7 year-old would receive between $3.50 and $7 per week.
A good portion of families attach chores to allowance, chores that are non-negotiable and necessary as a member of the family.
To help them learn the value of money you can have a list of additional chores that they can do to earn extra money. For instance, the list could include: take out all trash from all trash cans, $1; give the dog a bath, $2; mow the lawn, $10.

, Now that they have more money they need to know what to do with it. Prepare for this in advance with your own list of things you know they want to get. Then sit down and explain to them, using a pen and paper, how to go about getting them.

, As children grow older they become more aware and understanding of the world around them. This is the perfect time to teach them to be a positive force in the community. Take money from that “sharing” jar and donate it to an organization in your community that could use your financial assistance.Most food banks and the like love to have kids come and help out so take it a step further and donate time as well. Nothing shows them how much good they can do than packing boxes and bags full of the food they see every day in your cabinets for people who can’t afford to buy it. This gives them a greater appreciation of money.
Be certain to reinforce this either during your car ride to/from volunteering or even while you are doing it.
Reinforce in them the idea that by giving you receive, both in the good feeling that helping others brings but in putting positive energy into their lives. Nothing creates success and happiness faster than cultivating positive energy.

, Add a fourth very important jar: investing. They can save their money in this jar to put in the bank or to buy the supplies they need to do a lemonade stand or some other moneymaking opportunity.Remember to divide their money equally between their jars. So if they get $10 per week, then $2.50 goes into each jar.
If they do decide to do a lemonade stand, help them with the math so they see how much money they’ll need. Contribute to the cause as well because this teaches them that as they grow older it is possible to find investors for their great ideas.
Encourage them to do a garage sale to sell all the toys they never play with anymore or the clothes they’ve outgrown. Then let them divide the money up evenly amongst their jars.

, Open an account for their investing savings. This will give them their first tangible step into the adult world of money management. They will be very excited to check that statement every month and you should be too as it encourages important habits and skills., This is a good time to let them know how great it is and how proud you are that they are managing their money. One way to do this is to match what they save. If they save money in their investing jar and keep it there, then at the end of the month you can match what they saved, doubling their money.If they are saving up for something in particular, have them find out each time they count their money how much they have, and how much they still need. You can toss a few extra bucks into this account if you see them working hard toward their goal.
You can add money for any jar or all of them if you’d like. The downside is, of course, they decide to buy that one special thing with ALL their jars, effectively putting you in the crosshairs of a very difficult decision.
An easy solution is at the end of every month, the investing jar goes into a bank account, the sharing jar is shared, and the spending and savings jars can be evolving. This way what they spend and save is their choice., This is easy to do and is a great physical representation that will remind them regularly of how far they’ve come and where they are headed. It also implants in their brains the importance of saving. You can chart how long to reach a goal, how much is saved, or any number of other specific things., They will understand that growing older brings with it more choices and more responsibilities and by talking to them you are giving them the respect you give to an adult. On top of that, the growing complexity of their lives probably means $10-15 a week isn’t enough. Explain to them under what circumstances you will give them additional money and what the total budget for the month is.


This is a great first step for learning to budget as an older, more mature teenager.
Learning the importance of financial independence and how to go about it will instill confidence and lead to an even more mature child.
You can also give them incentives by offering rewards for excellent behavior or terrific grades.

, Give them firm guidelines on how much they get. Once that number is discussed, they can access that money until it is used up. This will teach them to shop for the best deals rather than rushing out in one big shopping spree and spending it all at once. As a result, they will find out how much more they can get if they manage their budget and spending., Take the lemonade stand concept a step further and have them go around the neighborhood to weed gardens, rake lawns for leaves, and shovel snow off sidewalks and driveways for money. You can also have them walk people's dogs for a little bit of cash. There are a lot of small ways to earn extra money that can turn into a side business for an entrepreneurial child.

, It’s important to put money away, not only to spend but to create flexibility to deal with all of life’s unexpected events. Putting aside a set figure every time they get money, say 10-percent, is a great way to learn how to create a growing surplus of cash., Once again, there are many sites and programs that are sophisticated yet understandable for older children and teenagers. Use them to your advantage. These can explain everything from how to manage your checking account to how to budget for needs (bills) and wants (weekend at the beach)."

Pick a time when your child is sober and you won’t be interrupted or distracted., You may feel uncomfortable bringing up this topic, but it's best to be straightforward and clear. Make sure there isn't any room for confusion as to what you're talking about.Say something like, “I found a glass pipe in your room the other day, and you smelled like marijuana after you came home from Mitchell’s house. I’m concerned about you. Are you using drugs?”

, If your child gets angry or denies using drugs, don’t give up. Show them any evidence you’ve gathered, and tell them why you’re worried. Ask them to be honest with you about what’s going on.Say something like, “You aren’t in trouble, but I need you to tell me the truth. I know this is hard to talk about, but it’s my responsibility to keep you safe.”

, If your child is willing to talk to you, gather as much information as possible so you can understand them better. Ask questions about which drugs they’re using, how using drugs makes them feel, and whether any of their friends pressure them to use., Keep your cool, even if you feel anything but cool right now. Your child won’t open up to you if they feel attacked. Treat the drug use – not your child – as the problem.If you’re too shaken up to stay cool right now, give yourself some time to calm down before you talk to your child.

, Emphasize to your child that you want to keep them healthy and safe, not boss them around. Be sensitive to any social or emotional problems they’re going through. Reassure them that there are ways to feel better without drugs, and tell them you’ll help them get any kind of support they need., Let your child know what you expect from them. Tell them that you won’t stand for their drug use, and explain what the consequences will be if they don’t stop. If you are taking away any of their privileges, explain why.For instance, you might tell your child that you will find a rehab program for them if they don’t stop using drugs on their own.
You might also limit the hours they can be out by themselves.

, Confiscate any drugs or paraphernalia you find, and dispose of them where your child won’t be able to get them back. Don’t allow your child to see friends who use or sell drugs. If your child drives, revoke their driving privileges until they can prove they’re not using drugs anymore.

, In some cases, talking to your child about your expectations and reducing their access to drugs and negative influences may fix the problem. However, in some cases, your child may continue to use or be unable to stop on their own.

If no matter what you try, your child continues to show signs of drug use or experiences withdrawal when they try to stop, you should get outside help., For many people, calling a drug abuse hotline is a great way to get your foot in the door and help your child find treatment. These hotlines are completely anonymous and you or your teen can call to ask questions or share concerns.

Teens in the U.S. may call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration national helpline at 1-800-662-HELP., If your child needs professional help, start with a visit to their pediatrician or another doctor. A medical professional will be able to diagnose your child and recommend some next steps for treatment., If your child’s addiction is mild to moderate, an outpatient treatment program might be enough to help them get better. This will keep them living at home and going to school. If their addiction is severe, consider sending them to a live-in treatment facility to recover., Use the internet or the yellow pages to look up addiction treatment centers near you. Make a list of the programs that look like they might be a good fit for your child. If you’re in the U.S., the SAMHSA website is a good place to start your search., Contact the programs on your list to get more information about them. Ask them about their treatment approach, their staff’s qualifications, and whether they encourage families to be involved in a patient’s recovery., It may be a good idea for you and your spouse or co-parent (and possibly your child) to arrange a visit to the treatment center. That way, you can get a firsthand look at the facilities and see how the program works. Doing this may also help your child open up to the idea of getting treatment., Some insurance plans cover addiction treatment. Check to see if the programs you’re interested in will accept your insurance. You may also be able to find low-cost public treatment programs in your area., To fully recover, your child will need to keep seeing a counselor or attending a support group after they finish treatment. Once your child is in a treatment program, you can talk to the staff about the best options for aftercare., Find healthy ways to cope with your stress and other emotions. Get some exercise, see your friends, or just take a few minutes every day to breathe and center yourself.It’s easy to forget about yourself when your child is in trouble, but running yourself ragged with stress will only make it harder for you to help your child.

, Discuss your child’s drug use with your partner and your other kids if it’s affecting family life. Keep your discussion age-appropriate if you have other young children. Be honest, but don’t make a bigger deal of it than you have to.For instance, it’s okay to tell a four-year-old that his older sibling is in rehab because they are sick. A ten-year-old, on the other hand, can understand the basics of addiction, but don’t give them any details that might scare them.

, You can meet people who are going through the same thing as you through groups like Al-Anon, Nar-Anon, and Parents of Addicted Loved Ones (PAL). Look for a chapter in your area, or consider starting one yourself. Online support groups and message boards are another good option.

, Drug abuse hurts the whole family, not just the addicted person. Family therapy can help you heal together and address any issues that might have contributed to your child using drugs in the first place. Look for a therapist who specializes in helping families with addiction issues."
"
Expect that the child will try to control the situation.,
Maintain consistent, predictable schedules and routines.,
Set expectations and boundaries.",How to Work With a Child With Reactive Attachment Disorder1," A child with RAD has likely had an uncertain, neglected past. For example, the child may not have been fed regularly as an infant, or bounced around from foster care settings so frequently that they never felt secure. As a result, they constantly make attempts to “control” their environment through their behavior.They may manipulate others, rather than genuinely connect with them, because of this need to control.Other controlling behaviors you might see include:


Aggressive behavior and outbursts.Clinginess and constant need for attention.
Nonstop chattering.;
, A child with RAD may have not had much consistency as a baby or toddler. It is very important, both from a behavior management standpoint, as well as the child’s own emotional health, that the child know what to expect every day. Creating a routine for a child helps the child feel safe, cared for, and more relaxed.Let the child know the day’s schedule, then stick to it. For example, you could say, “Today you are going to school. After school, we’ll go to the park, then work on homework, then take a bath.”
If the child can read, write the day’s schedule in a visible place. You could also draw pictures for a young child.
Keep the routine consistent. Kids learn from making sense of patterns in their lives. They’ll understand what is next and understand the behavior expected of them. They will also be less stressed because they know what is coming and how to deal with it.Give the child as much notice as possible if there is going to be a change in the routine. For example, “Next Saturday you’re not going to swimming class as usual, because it is Kyle’s birthday party. We’re going to Kyle’s house instead.” You could get out a calendar and show the child how many days away it is.Do your best to avoid changes in routine with RAD children. It can be too stressful on them and you may notice a backslide in their behavior.

, Be clear in establishing rules and expectations.Kids with reactive attachment disorder will find loopholes in rule enforcement and may argue with you, so you need to be clear and firm up front.


Make the child aware of consequences that will occur if he or she disobeys rules, and follow through with your stated consequences. This can help the child understand that they do have control over certain situations, because they can control their behavior to avoid repercussions.
Consider creating a contract with the child that indicates rules, expectations, and consequences for not following the rules. Keep the contract in an easily accessible place for reference.Keep in mind that a contract is a mutual agreement. Let the child have a say in the rules and the consequences to help them take control of their behavior.
For example, your contract could say, “Charlie agrees to the following rules: 1) Cleaning his room once a week. 2) No fighting with his brother and sister. 3) Following directions the first time they are given. If Charlie does not follow these rules, he will not be allowed to play video games for 24 hours.” You may also want to specify a reward for following the rules to help provide your child with some positive reinforcement. For example, “If Charlie follows the rules, then he will get to play with his favorite toy.”

"
"
Communicate the good over the bad.,
Do your best to remain calm.,
Use “one-liners” to maintain calm.,
Avoid timeouts.,
Let the child know they are loved and safe.",How to Work With a Child With Reactive Attachment Disorder2," Emphasize the child’s good behavior instead of pointing out the negative. It is important that you maintain the relationship with this child by correcting their behavior in a positive, empathic way. Disciplining a RAD child with harsh words and negative feedback only reinforces their view that they are alone in the world.Say “yes” instead of “no.” For example, the child wants to play outside, but has not yet finished their homework. Say, “Yes, you can go outside as soon as your homework is done!” instead of “No, you need to get your homework done.”
Praise rather than scold. Commend what the child did correctly rather than make an issue of what they didn’t do. For example, if the child leaves the door wide open in the middle of winter to rush outside and play in the snow, you might say, “Wow, you did a great job getting all your winter gear on all by yourself! Can you do me a favor and remember to close the door next time? We want our house to stay warm.”

, The child may argue with you, antagonize you, and intentionally get into trouble in order to maintain their control over the situation. Your job as their caregiver is to not engage with their drama. Acknowledge their feelings, but do not fight with them.If the child is having a temper tantrum, for example, you could calmly say, “I understand that you are angry and upset. I will let you work through it so long as you don’t hurt me, or others, or yourself.”
Wait until the child has calmed down before talking to them. Stay close to the child to let them know you are there, and restrain them from self-harm or hurting you if necessary, but let the behavior run its course. They are so worked up that talking to them will not accomplish anything.

, These are sentences that can prevent power struggles and place responsibility for the child’s behavior on the child.Stay calm and free of sarcasm, and consider using some of the following to diffuse an argument:


”That’s interesting.”
”Hmmmm.”
”I’ll be glad to listen when your voice is as soft as mine.”
”Thanks for the honest answer.”

, Timeouts only reinforce the self-isolating behavior of a child with reactive attachment disorder.Instead, you may wish to keep the child with you, talking about what happened and how they could do differently next time.


You could say, “I’m so glad you’re sitting here with me. I know it must be hard after what happened. I know you’re upset. But let’s talk about why you’re so upset that you kicked Xavier. What do you think you could do differently next time?”

, Following a tantrum, argument, or bad behavior, reassure the child that you still love/care about them, that you are not going to hurt them, and that they are safe. Children with RAD, as well as neglected children in general, are more attuned to others’ negative emotions than typical children.Tell the child that while you may be upset at the moment, your feelings for the child haven’t changed.


For example, you could say, “Emma, I know we were both a little angry before. I want to let you know that I am disappointed in your behavior, but there is nothing you could do that would make me stop loving you. I want to help you make a better choice next time. Let’s talk about how we can fix this together.”

"
"
Insist on eye contact.A person can’t fully understand emotions without looking at another’s eyes, and it is part of the challenge of a child with RAD to understand emotions, empathy, and develop a conscience.,
Teach the child about their emotions.,
Show physical affection, but be cautious.,
Spend quality time with the child.,
Encourage a healthy lifestyle.",How to Work With a Child With Reactive Attachment Disorder3,"


Gentle reminders like, “Mia, eye contact,” or “Can you look me in the eyes when you ask me?” can help nudge the child. Compliment the child for good eye contact.
Remember that you don’t want to battle a child with RAD, so if the child seems unwilling or defiant, back off and don’t force it.

, Consider that a child with RAD has limited understanding of their emotional landscape, and cannot always empathize with others.You can help them learn more about feeling emotions and expressing them appropriately by trying some of the following strategies:


Name the emotion you are seeing them express. You could say, “Elijah, you look like you are really angry about this homework assignment! I can see your hands clenched up in fists!” or “You must think that dog is funny. You keep laughing at it!”
Help them understand nonverbal language cues like body language or tone of voice. For example, “What do you think it means when someone puts their head in their hands?”
Model an appropriate apology when necessary. You could tell the child, “I am sorry I hurt your feelings when I said that you couldn’t wear your red shirt for school pictures. I know it’s your favorite shirt and my saying no made you sad.”
Talk about characters in books and TV shows and ask the child what they think the character might be feeling. For example, “How do you think Baby Bear felt when he saw that Goldilocks broke his chair?” If the child doesn’t know, you could say, “I think he probably felt very sad, and maybe a little mad and a little scared because he didn’t know who broke his chair!”

, Most children with reactive attachment disorder do not like to be touched.If you are new to caring for the child, do not jump in right away with a lot of physical contact. Move slowly and establish trust.


Do not force them to cuddle or do anything they don’t want to. Rather, give them pats on the back, put an arm around their shoulder, tousle their hair affectionately, or even give them a high-five.
Determine their comfort level and work within that, but incorporate physical affection into your daily routine. It helps the child to establish a genuine connection.

, Find something to do that the child enjoys and spend some one-on-one time getting to know them better. You are helping the child understand relationships, as well as learn what a healthy connection feels like.


Consider activities like playing board games, reading stories together, going for a hike, or going out for a special treat.
Let the child decide the day’s activity. Give them a list of options: “Today we can either do a craft at the library or go fishing at the pond. What sounds better to you?”
If you are a teacher, you might show interest in the child by asking about their drawings, spending time with the child while they play with their favorite classroom toy, or saving a special book for them for silent reading time.

, Maintain your own healthy habits to role model good behavior. Encourage the child to make healthy food choices, get plenty of rest, maintain good hygiene, and exercise. Let the child know that it will be easier to deal with difficult emotions when their body is healthy and strong.


Have the child get plenty of exercise. Exercise not only keeps you healthy, but it helps improve depression and keeps you less stressed.Make sure the child is eating a nutritious diet and is getting enough food to meet their needs.

"
"
Tell the children the goal they are to achieve through the task.,
Give very explicit step-by-step directions on how to complete the task.,
Expect children to make mistakes.,
Encourage children to ask questions and put thought into what they are doing and why they are doing it.,
Suggest alternative actions.,
Keep it entertaining.,
Praise and reward children for good work and good behavior.,
Use patience.,
Don't be afraid to show authority when necessary.

",How to Work With Children," Children are often very anxious and cautious. They like to know exactly what they will be doing or what will be happening.


Always give them the reassurance of stating the objective. Show a picture or sample of the completed task when working on a project with a child.;
, Never assume that the children will know what you are talking about. After all, they do not have the background or life experience you have.


Model the action you wish the child to complete.
Name one step at a time with great details. Make sure the step is accomplished and understood before moving to the next one.

, The best learning that takes place is from making your own mistakes.


Do not criticize children for the things they do wrong. Instead, help them learn how to do the things right.
Use a soft voice. Try not to yell at children it will only make them mad and disrespect you.

,


Never dismiss or condemn the child for being inquisitive.

, Children have short attention spans and can very easily become off task, which often leads to mischief and trouble.


Offer a more suitable activity for the child when a negative action is taking place. This is often more effective than punishment. In some cases, the children simply do not know what they should be doing so they create something.

, Children need excitement to stay motivated.


Use as much enthusiasm as possible when working with children. If you are excited about the chore, or appear excited, the children will be also.
Be creative and make a game out of learning and chores.
Use songs, poems, board games, books and other games to relay the message and make the work pass more quickly.

,


You must tell children exactly what to do and also let them know when they do it right. Children need positive encouragement even more than adults.
Use a positive word or touch to encourage the repetition of the behavior when you see an action you would like to have repeated by the child. A pat on the back or ""good job"" is often sufficient enough to make the child continue the action.

, Be patient. Kids hate when adults don't give them a chance to think.

Know that your baby's hair should not be washed every day.,
Purchase a shampoo which is not too hard on the skin as babies are much more sensitive than adults.,
Be sure to wash your baby's body before beginning their hair.,
Take your baby out of the tub and wrap him/her in a warm, dry towel.,
Position yourself so that you can safely hold your baby over the tub or sink.,
Hold your baby so that only his or her head is over the tub.,
Use either a cup or your palm to gently pour lukewarm water over your baby's hair.,
Take a small amount of shampoo into your palm.,
Gently lather up your baby's head with the shampoo.,
Wash the shampoo out of your baby's hair using the same method as in step 6.,
Grab your washcloth to dry your baby's hair.",How to Wash Your Baby's Hair," Since babies do not exercise or get as dirty as adults, their hair is also generally cleaner. Wash your baby's hair around 2 times a week.


Of course, if the hair is visibly dirty, you should wash the hair.;
, If the bottle says ""tear-free,"" it may be a good choice.


It would be best to ask your pediatrician what he/she recommends since the stores can be confusing.
It may also be a good idea to purchase a non-scented shampoo so that the baby does not object to the smell.

, Babies can become cold very quickly so heat your child up by cleaning their body first.


This will also help make your baby more comfortable and hopefully more cooperative.

, Do not wrap it so tight that your baby is uncomfortable but make sure it is snug.


Try to fold your baby's arms across their chest before wrapping the towel around. This is a comfortable position for the baby to be in and will help them be more cooperative.

, Consider your baby's stage of development. Many infants will require you to support their neck and head while being held and washed. Look at how to hold a baby properly if you do not know how already.


If the tub or sink is below your waist, kneel down next to the tub.

, This will allow you to wash the hair while keeping the rest of the body dry.


This step may be easier if you wash your baby over a sink instead. This will only work, though, if the baby is small enough to be held over a sink.

, Keep on doing so until all of your baby's hair is wet. The water should be warm enough to feel the heat but not so hot that it hurts to touch. Find a temperature comfortable for you and then make it slightly colder for your baby.


Take care not to let any water get to your baby's ears or eyes. This will be uncomfortable for the baby just as it is for you.
Try to angle your baby's head slightly back so that the water will flow away from the eyes and ears.

, The amount will depend on the thickness of your baby's hair, but try not to use more than the size of a quarter.


You will need to set your baby down or hand him/her off to another person for this step.

, Use gentle, circular motions to create a small amount of lather. Use the tips of your fingers to massage and clean the scalp. Do not run your fingernails along the scalp, though.


You should only need to shampoo their hair for around 20-30 seconds since the hair will not be too dirty or sweaty.

, You may need to use more water in order to remove all of the shampoo.


Try to gently run your hand through your baby's hair to make sure all of the shampoo is gone.

, Do not dry too vigorously. Try to palm your baby's head and move your hand in slow circles while holding the base of the head and the neck.


Try to use a warm washcloth to help soothe the baby.

Don’t answer the home phone (unless it is also the work phone), let the answering machine get it.,
Have a designated work area.,
Inform family and friends.,
Get dressed.,
Pay back time.,
Learn when to say no.,
Learn how to turn off.",How to Work from Home With Children," Decide when you will and will not work and stick to it (most of the time). Just as if you were at work have a time to start and a time to finish.;
, However tempting it may be, don't hang out a load of washing or make that quick call to your mum. It is too easy to get distracted and you end up having a day where nothing is achieved.

, Like a school timetable, assign different aspects of your job a time period to work on them. For instance; Monday morning might be accounting; time to pay all the bills and chase outstanding debts, Wednesday afternoon might be follow up calls to clients and Friday night when the kids are in bed might be answering all those non urgent emails.

, If you have a separate work line get a separate phone with a distinctive ring.

, If you don't have the space to set up a separate room, set up a desk and everything else you need in a workable spot, like a corner of the dining room. See if you can get a screen to cover the area when work is done.

, Tell them that yes you will be home, but you will be working and while you love their company, just as they couldn’t just drop in on you in a normal office, they can't do it when you work from home either.

, While for some this is the ultimate motivation to working at home, not needing to dress to impress, some people find it is easier to get into work mode if they are dressed rather than in their ""jammies"".

, If you need to work instead of doing family things in order to meet a deadline, try to pay that time back when things are quieter, this way the family understands that work is important, but also that they are important too!

, working from home can mean it is hard to say no to work or projects and you end up working long hours to complete assignments. Know what your limits are and stick to them, especially in the beginning.

, With work there at home, it can be hard to switch off. If you find it hard to switch off at the end of the day, try doing non-urgent work for the last half hour, or going for a walk to clear your head.

Rest.,
Use a humidifier.,
Make a saline nasal spray.,
Wear masks.,
Comfort your child.",How to Treat the Flu in Children1," Try to get your child to rest as much as possible. Let your child watch her favorite TV show or movie, give her some magazines or a book, or let her listen to music. Make sure she is comfortable on the couch or her bed.Your child should stay home from school to reduce her interaction with others. Not only will it allow her to rest, but also keep her from spreading the germs to other children at school.;
, Set up a humidifier or set bowls of water around the room to humidify the air. This can help your child breathe better and break up congestion.Make sure to change the water every day and clean it according to the directions.

, A saltwater nasal spray can be used to help your child get through the flu. Saline nasal sprays can be made at home and used as often as needed without worries since they are safe for both children and infants.Start by boiling eight ounces of water and allow it to cool until it is very warm.
Add ¼ teaspoon of salt to the eight ounces of water. Mix well. You can use sea salt or table salt. If your child is allergic to iodine, make sure to use non-iodized salt.
If you wish, you can also add ½ teaspoon of baking soda and mix well. The baking soda will adjust the pH of the solution to make it less likely to sting a sore nose.
Pour the solution into a clean spray bottle. Spray one or two squirts into each nostril as needed.
For infants and small children, wait two to three minutes. Then, tilt the baby’s head back slightly and use the soft, rubber-bulb syringe to gently remove nasal secretions. Just squeeze about ¼ of the air out of the bulb. Only insert the tip of the bulb into the child’s nose. Avoid touching the inside of the nostril. Wipe the bulb off on a tissue and discard the tissue. Use a new tissue for each nostril to minimize contamination and the spread of an infection. Wash your hands before and after each treatment.Repeat this only two to three times a day.
Pour any leftover solution into a covered container and refrigerate. When you get ready to use it again, remember to warm up the refrigerated solution. When you are ready to use it, make sure it's just warm, not hot. After two days, throw out any unused solution.

, Another way to prevent getting the flu is to use masks when going out in groups or in public where someone might have the flu. A mask can help prevent germs from infecting you and your children.If your child has the flu and needs to go out in public, have your child wear a mask to protect others also.


You may consider wearing masks to schools, offices, shopping malls, and grocery stores.

, The most important thing you may be able to do for your child is to comfort her. It is pretty miserable having the flu, and sometimes the best thing a parent can do is to understand, let your child know you understand how miserable she is, and reassure her that she will feel better soon."

Eat frequent, small meals.,
Feed your child protein.,
Incorporate vitamins and minerals.,
Drink plenty of fluids.",How to Treat the Flu in Children2," Have your child eat small, frequent, nutritious meals. Try to get her to eat small amounts of solid and easily digestible food often throughout the day. You want to provide a constant supply of energy so that the immune system has all the necessary components to do its job., When your child has the flu, you should include quality protein in her meals to help boost her immune system. Good sources of quality protein include lean, skinless chicken and fish.


Try some chicken soup, which not only has been shown to have healing properties, but also contains chicken, a good source of protein. Keep it light and easily digestible with brown rice and a few vegetables.Consider fixing your child an egg in the morning. Eggs are an easily digested protein. They also contain zinc, which may help boost the immune system.Give your child Greek yogurt with lunch or for a snack. It contains protein.

, Vegetables and fruits are important while your child has the flu because they contain large amounts of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other nutrients. Try including vegetables in broth-based soups or tossing them into an omelet.B complex vitamins, specifically riboflavin and vitamin B6, have been shown to boost the immune system. Leafy green vegetables, like spinach, kale, and other greens, are good sources of B vitamins.Vitamin E is an antioxidant. Avocados are a good food source of vitamin E.
Foods rich in vitamin C and antioxidants are important. Try red peppers, oranges and other citrus fruits, tropical fruits like pineapple, berries, and leafy green vegetables.You should also include foods rich in beta-carotenes and vitamin A. Foods that contain these nutrients are carrots, squash, and sweet potatoes.

, Fevers that often accompany the flu can cause dehydration. So, your child should drink lots of fluids. These fluids can be water, juices, electrolyte beverages like Pedialyte, and clear chicken or vegetable broths. At a minimum, try to get your older child to drink 8 eight ounce glasses of water or other liquid a day. If your child won’t drink anything, consider letting her eat popsicles or hydrating fruit, like grapes and melon.
You can add honey and lemon to water for an extra immuno-boost, but do not give honey to children under one year old.
Green tea contains antioxidants and are soothing.
Fruit juices contain vitamins and minerals. Make sure to buy fruit juice without a lot of additives, artificial ingredients, or added sugars, like high fructose corn syrup. Look for 100% fruit juice.

Check with your doctor first.,
Make Echinacea tea.,
Try garlic.,
Brew elderberry tea.,
Try ginger.,
Consider eucalyptus.",How to Treat the Flu in Children3," Before you give any herbs or herbal teas to your child, check with your child's doctor. Some herbs are not recommended for young children, so it is best to ask if an herbal medicine or tea is safe for your child before you administer anything.

, Echinacea can help with early cold symptoms. Echinacea may be able to reduce the symptoms and the duration of the flu.To make Echinacea tea, put one to two grams of dried root or 15 to 20 drops of pure extract in your child’s tea. You can let your child drink this up to three times a day.
In one study, Echinacea was as effective as oseltamivir in the early stages of the flu.Echinacea rarely causes any adverse effects, such as nausea and headaches. Allergic reactions are rare.

, Garlic has antibacterial and antiviral properties and has been used for thousands of years to reduce the severity of colds and the flu by boosting the immune system. You can put garlic in all your cooking. For example, take one to two cloves of garlic and add it to the chicken soup you make your child.You can give your child a garlic supplement. You can talk to your doctor about his option. Make sure to read the manufacturer’s instructions before giving a garlic supplement to your child.
One recent study indicated that garlic could reduce the severity of symptoms., Elderberry tea is a long-standing folk remedy for colds and the flu. Elderberry is an effective immune modulating herb as well as having antiviral properties.It’s supposed to help lessen congestion and help you sweat out fevers. Elderberry also has the distinct advantage of having a flavor lots of kids love.


To make elderberry tea, place two tablespoons of elderberry syrup or two tablespoons of dried berries in two cups of water. Bring to a boil, then let simmer for 15 minutes. Strain the tea and pour into a mug. If your child is over one year old, then you can sweeten the tea with honey for extra healing properties., Ginger has antiviral and antibacterial properties and may also help reduce the production of mucus. You can add it to recipes or put it in tea.However, make sure you get no more than four grams of ginger per day from all different sources.
Doses for children vary, so ask your pediatrician.
To make ginger tea, put one tablespoon of freshly grated ginger into two cups of water. Bring the water to a boil, then let simmer for 10 minutes., You can add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to a humidifier to help relieve congestion and sinus issues. You can also use dried leaves or fresh leaves in a topical rub.Do not give eucalyptus oil orally or allow a child to drink eucalyptus tea. Eucalyptus tea can be toxic to children.
If your child is under the age of six, then do not give him or her cough drops that contain eucalyptus.
Do not use eucalyptus on your child's skin unless he or she is over the age of two.

Get a prescription antiviral drug.,
Refrain from using cold and cough medicine in young children.,
Use pain relievers for fevers.,
Consider a flu shot.",How to Treat the Flu in Children4," There are a number of relatively new antiviral drugs that your pediatrician may recommend under some circumstances. These antiviral drugs may be recommended for children with severe flu or who are hospitalized because of the flu. These drugs may also be recommended for those children at high risk of complications, such as babies under age two and children with asthma, heart or lung disease, cancer, or diabetes. These are ideally given within the first two days of showing flu symptoms. Your doctor may first wish to test your child for the virus with a nasal swab. The following drugs have been approved in the US:Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®): This can be given to children two weeks of age or older. It is also approved for prevention of influenza in children one year of age or older. Oseltamivir can be taken as a pill or a liquid.
Zanamivir (Relenza®): This medication can be given to children seven years and older. It can also be given to children five years and older in order to prevent the flu. It is not recommended for people with underlying respiratory problems, heart disease, and asthma. Zanamivir is delivered using a special inhaler (Diskhaler®).
The most common side effects for Oseltamivir are nausea and vomiting while the most common side effects of Zanamivir are diarrhea, nausea, sinusitis, nasal signs and symptoms, bronchitis, cough, headache, dizziness, and ear, nose, and throat infections.

, According to the FDA, you should not use any over-the-counter cold and cough medicines for children under the age of four years. For older children, call your physician.There is evidence that indicates that these OTC cough medicines really aren’t as helpful as people believe them to be. There is a risk of serious side effects.

, It is best to allow your child's body to fight off a fever under 102 degrees Fahrenheit on its own. However, you may need to give your child a fever reducer if your child is uncomfortable or if the fever is over 102. To reduce a fever, you can give a child older than six months old ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen can also help with any aches or pains your child has.You can give acetaminophen to babies under six months old, but contact your doctor if you are not sure about how much to give.
Don't give aspirin to any child under the age of 19 with the flu.Alternatively, you can bathe your child in lukewarm water to bring the fever down and make your child more comfortable.

, Talk to your doctor about a vaccination against the flu for you and your children. The CDC recommends that anyone over the age of six months should be vaccinated.Two flu vaccines are available for children. One vaccine covers three flu virus strains, while the other covers four strains. However, the specific vaccines change each year and may contain different numbers and types of strains.
Children over the age of two may be able to use a nasal spray vaccine; however, it is unclear whether or not the spray is effective. Discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist first and see what they recommend.

Create a support team for your child.,
Do not be judgmental when teaching a child with dyslexia.,
Be patient.,
Educate your other students about dyslexia.,
Encourage him to take baby steps.,
Win their trust.,
Allow the child some extra time to complete work.,
Teach memorization through visualization.,
Help your child with phonics.,
Make it a habit to read to your dyslexic child rhyming stories.,
Help your child build a word family.,
Give your dyslexic child ways to express herself without words.,
Give oral exams as well as written exams.",How to Support a Child with Dyslexia1," It takes a team of concerned individuals to address dyslexia. This is often called student support teams which can consist of parents, principals, school psychologists, teachers, speech therapists, reading therapists and other professionals who have the competency to help the child get the learning he deserves at school in the light of thier special needs as a dyslexic. This team will meet regularly to discuss the child’s existing learning issues and their progress if he is already receiving a specialized learning program., After their parents and other members of the family, teachers are the adults children look up to. Teachers inspire, motivate and support their students. If a child seems like he wants to engage in class but is unable to take the pressures of schoolwork, do not assume that there is a problem with their attitude. He may be struggling with their inability to read, write, spell, or speak well.


If you notice that a student seems to be struggling, schedule a meeting with his or her parents to discuss what may be the issue.

, Try to understand the problems that the child is facing such as understanding instructions or keeping up with the pace of the work or with peers. Try to provide a conducive atmosphere which is free of taunts, ridicule and mockery. Encourage her to make use of simple tools like folders and some software apps to keep herself organized.

, Going to school can be a traumatizing experience for a child with dyslexia--he may be afraid that other kids will make fun of him or he may feel like there is something wrong with him. If you notice this child falling behind socially, make an effort to educate their peers about dyslexia in an effort to make them more empathetic.

, Commend him for what he achieves--doing this will boost their self-esteem and when this is high he will not hesitate to take on bigger responsibilities and bigger steps to take charge of their learning.

, Place him in a seat that is close to your desk--by doing this you will be able to monitor their mistakes and discuss them quietly with him, rather than announcing them in front of the whole class. It is important to make him feel comfortable and to avoid putting him in situations in which he may feel uncomfortable.


For example, if he struggles with reading a sentence without making mistakes, do not make him read aloud in class.

, It is important that you allocate a few extra hours just for her to make sure that she is able to cope with her work. If you have time, or your classroom as a teacher’s aid, ask him or her to spend some time working with the child on phonics.

, This technique helps kids associate letters with actual words by turning the letter into its own picture. Kids with dyslexia can have trouble putting words together and remembering how these are arranged in a sentence. They also have serious trouble memorizing phrases as short as those consisting of only four words. To help them with this, allow them to create graphical representation of the vowels thereby allowing them to associate the letters with the words they use every day.For example:


An “a” can be written so that is would look like an apple (a simple leaf on top of the “a” can do the trick).
“E” can assume a more oblong shape reminding the child of an egg.

, Phonics is often taken for granted in reading skills. Most kids get phonics early with no problem at all. This is simply not the case with dyslexic children. Phonics, which literally translates to “language sounds”, is harder for kids having serious issues with letters in the first place. There are two major ways to help your child with phonics as listed in the following steps.

, This can help him have a clear idea of word families that will be a building block in letter sound identification later on. With the help of rhyming story books, the child can group words like ban, man, tan, and pan, or sat, mat, hat, bat, and cat easily adding to their understanding of these words and what letters these words consists of.

, When your child gets the idea of rhyming words, help him build a word family which can be as short and simple as fig, big, wig, and so on. When this is proving to be getting easier to your child go on to harder word families like shop, prop, flop, and chop. Get the difficulty level progress forward as your child understands the association of these words and letters.

, While writing an essay might not be her strong suit, creating a picture or poster to express her thoughts on a subject may work better. Create projects that do not focus on the written word, like art projects or construction projects., If a dyslexic student in your classroom is seriously struggling with written exams, allow her to perform oral exams. Make every other test an oral exam, or at least have an oral component of each exam that you give.

Make your child a part of the decision-making process.,
Talk with your child about her disability.,
Treat your child with respect.",How to Support a Child with Dyslexia2," Let your child help make decisions regarding the education program he enters and the learning tools he uses. Allowing him to be a part of the decision making process will boost their self-esteem and widen their awareness about their disability. With an increased awareness, he will also be able to see that he has the ability to overcome the challenges he faces., Explain dyslexia to your child. At the same time, let your child talk about what she is experiencing. Let her talk about herself, what she is going through, and how she feels about it. You can also help her to analyze her disability, look at her strengths, and come up with a plan to overcome her challenges., Extend your unconditional love to him. Realizing that there are people around him he can fall back upon for support is very comforting. Help him take pride in who he is and what he has achieved. Motivate him with love and support.

Purchase a read-aloud application.,
Get a speech recognition application.,
Use an application that helps with word recognition.,
Consider getting applications that help with test taking.",How to Support a Child with Dyslexia3," There are applications that can convert text to speech which can enable you to listen to the books instead or reading them. This can be helpful to children who have difficulty reading but are good listeners and can follow what they hear. These applications come with different font and color settings to provide further assistance to the child in identifying words. They also have multiple sound and voice options, allowing the child to choose one he can relate to.Kindle, read2go, ClaroSpeak, web reader, and audiobooks from Audible are just some of the applications you can choose from.

, There are applications that work with speech recognition software which perform the task of converting the speech to text on the screen. This is especially useful for children with dyslexia who have difficulty writing correctly using the correct spelling and grammatically appropriate sentences.


Howjsay Pronunciation Dictionary is an app that provides pronunciation related assistance.

, There are also applications that assist the child in word recognition and pronunciation by creating a phonics program that promotes better reading skills.These applications will also help your child with word identification, sounds of letters and reading.


These applications include ABC phonics word families and ABC pocket phonics.

, These applications are especially helpful for teachers who have dyslexic children in their classes. Some apps such as Audio Exam Creator help the teacher to record test questions for children with reading difficulty. Apps like this enable the students who are challenged by reading to take the exams by hearing the test questions read out to them aloud.

Gradually get rid of old toys.,
Introduce new toys as your budget allows.,
Repurpose old toys.,
Opt for fewer toys.,
Be patient.",How to Transition Kids to Big Kid Toys1," When you decide to transition your child to big kid toys, you should do so gradually. Do not abruptly dispose of toys from the earlier phases of your child’s life. Instead, gradually begin to get rid of toys your child no longer plays with by donating or selling them.Try beginning by purging toys that are broken or that your child no longer uses.;
, Set a budget for big kid toys. Once you decide how much you can spend on new toys, slowly introduce the new toys to your child. For example, if you can spend twenty dollars per month on big kid toys, make a special date each month to allow your child to choose a new toy., You don’t have to throw away all of your child’s old toys when they become a “big kid.” Instead, try repurposing them to support your child’s new stage of development. For example, a big kid can combine all their old blocks and use them in a larger engineering and construction project.

, Having fewer toys around can positively benefit your child’s development as they grow up. Fewer toys can help your child learn to be more creative, develop a longer attention span, and establish better social skills. Try replacing toys with activities and experiences, like taking dance lessons or visiting the zoo., Sometimes it is tough for children to transition to big kid toys, and many will want to hang on to their old toys. Do not force your child to get rid of old toys if you encounter resistance. Instead, try rewarding the child with an experience, activity, or new big kid toy when they let go of an old one.

Choose toys that educate while entertaining.,
Consider a musical instrument.,
Try fun fitness toys.,
Consider a construction set.,
Select science toys.,
Solve a puzzle.,
Choose digital toys wisely.",How to Transition Kids to Big Kid Toys2," Children in early elementary school are in the process of developing all kinds of new skills, ranging from reading and writing to art and math. Choose toys that serve an educational purpose while also entertaining the child.Try choosing toys like jigsaw puzzles, Legos, and educational board games.

, Learning to play an instrument will help your big kid develop fine motor skills, build listening skills, and increase their attention span. Try letting your child learn to play the piano, guitar, recorder, or drums., Fitness toys can help children gain self-confidence and develop social skills while getting exercise. For example, by jumping rope with friends, the child will learn to take turns, solve problems, and get along with others. Fitness toys can also help your child develop fine and gross motor skills.Encourage the child to play with toys like jump ropes, beanbags, and balls.

, Complex construction sets and accessories allow children to express their creativity while helping them develop fine motor skills. It is important to remember that construction sets are equally important for girls and boys, and there are many options out there made specifically for girls., Big kids are the perfect age to begin exploring the wonderful world of science, and toys are a great entry point. Science-centered toys can help your child develop problem-solving skills while expanding their imagination. These toys will also help your child develop science and math skills.Try toys like binoculars, a telescope, or an age-appropriate chemistry set.

, Your big kid is now ready for complex puzzles that combine problem solving, engineering, and art. Try putting together a jigsaw puzzle with your big kid. You can also opt for other types of puzzle-solving toys, like those that focus on pattern recognition or mazes., Some big kids are going to ask for digital toys like a video game console or a tablet, as well as the associated software and games. Always read reviews of digital toys before purchasing and make sure they are made specifically for your child's age range.


Always explore the games and toys yourself before handing them over to your child.
Make sure you supervise the child while they play.
Limit your child's screen time to no more than one hour per day with digital toys.

Talk to your doctor about getting antibiotics for your child.,
Take your infant to the hospital if you think she/he has a UTI.,
Stay away from giving your child antibiotics to treat recurrent UTIs.",How to Treat Symptoms of a UTI in Children and Adolescents1," If your child has a standard UTI (one that occurs in the lower urinary tract and bladder and is not recurrent) then he or she should take antibiotics to clear up the infection. The standard treatment is a four-day oral antibiotic course, though the course can sometimes last for longer than four days depending on the type of antibiotic prescribed. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include:


Trimethoprim.
Sulfamethoxazole.
Augmentin (a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate).;
, Infants who are younger than one month old and are thought to have a UTI must be taken to the hospital immediately. UTIs can be dangerous for infants who are younger than one month old.If you have an infant who is younger than two months old and is showing signs of a UTI combined with a fever, you should also take him/her to the hospital. There is a chance that the UTI is in the kidney rather than the bladder.

, While the UTI might be treated while the antibiotic is being taken, the UTI will more than likely come back as soon as your child stops taking the antibiotics. Therefore, routine use of antibiotics to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections in children and adolescents is generally not recommended since outcomes are not significantly improved with this practice.The additional risk, of course, is that overuse of antibiotics will more rapidly lead to increasing numbers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Perform a volunteer activity with your child.,
Make donations with your child.,
Get your child involved in the neighborhood.,
Give them household tasks to do.",How to Teach a Child to Help Others1," Volunteering can be a great way to instill a sense of giving in your child. It also makes the idea of helping more than an idea but a practice that they can continue as they get older. A variety of volunteer activities probably exist in your community that you can perform with your child to demonstrate how they can help others. Visit or call a community center, library, school, church, or other local non-profit organization to participate in a charity event or fundraising activity. Some organizations may have special activities for children. Make sure to call ahead to find out if it's the right fit.
Try to find something that aligns with your child's interests. If they like animals, see if there are opportunities at a local animal shelter. If they like to play games, a nursing home where volunteers entertain the elderly may be a great choice.;
, By donating used toys, clothing, and money to charity, your child can learn how their contributions can help others.


Sort through old toys and clothing with your child to determine what they no longer play with or wear. Then take your child with you to donate these items to a charity. This way they can see that things they no longer use are helping a child much like themselves and can feel the joys of giving. It might also help to put together baskets of food and toys for those that are less fortunate. , Helping people your child sees regularly will help them form a sense of community and to see how being helpful affects everyday people.


Help your child run errands or perform household chores for elderly neighbors. If your child is young it can be something as simple as checking their mail. For older children they can take part in more intensive tasks like yard work.
Suggest to your child that they help their friends in times of need; such as collecting their friends' homework assignments from school when they are ill or helping them pack their belongings when they are moving to a new home. Teach them to recognize situations people need help in, such as when they feel they need help themselves, and to take measures to alleviate a burden.

, Many parents give their children chores to do and this can be a great way to teach them to be helpful. They can be taught that they are part of the family unit and the value of everyone chipping in to help.


Start a chore chart. This way a child can learn to do helpful tasks like taking out the trash or washing the dishes and slowly get rewarded in order to build up good behaviors. It is best if the rewards are gradual so they have to persistently help in order to build up good habits. "

Up your child’s intake of yogurt.,
Increase the amount of cranberries your child eats.,
Consider having your child eat more pineapple.,
Give your child a vitamin C supplement.,
Dismiss the old belief that baking soda cures UTIs.,
Avoid giving your child caffeine when she has a UTI.",How to Treat Symptoms of a UTI in Children and Adolescents2," Yogurt contains probiotics that help to fight bad bacteria that can cause a UTI. In fact, probiotics contain good bacteria called lactobacilli that have been shown in several studies to reduce the incidence rate of UTI in both adults and children.Have your child eat yogurt every day to help clear up a UTI and prevent future UTIs from occurring.

, The ability of cranberries to decrease the risk of UTI is still subject to debate. Some medical studies have shown benefit while others have not. Cranberries contain several substances that, in the laboratory, can be shown to have antibacterial effects. If you want to try this method, have your child:


Drink at least 8 ounces of cranberry juice a day.
If your child doesn’t like cranberry juice, you can give him/her cranberry juice concentrate in tablet form.

, Pineapples naturally contain a mixture of enzymes (bromelain) that break down proteins, including proteins that promote inflammation. Combined with another similar enzyme (trypsin), it has been shown to significantly improve the effectiveness of antibiotics for the treatment of UTIs.There has not been much research done to prove that pineapples have the same effect in children but it can never hurt to give your child pineapple (unless he/she is allergic, in which case avoid giving your child pineapple).

, While studies done to determine the effectiveness of vitamin C on UTIs are inconclusive, some people believe that vitamin C can help to fight UTIs. This is because vitamin C may turn urine more acidic, making it harder for bad bacteria to grow and cause an infection.Infants who are 0 to 6 months old should get 40 mg of vitamin C each day.
Infants who are 7 to 12 months old should get 50 mg of vitamin C each day.
Children who are 4 to 8 years old should get 25 mg of vitamin C each day.
Children who are 9 to 13 years old should get 45 mg of vitamin C each day.
Male teens who are 14 to 18 years old should get 75 mg of vitamin C each day.
Female teens who are 14 to 18 years old should get 65 mg of vitamin C each day.

, It has long been claimed that baking soda can make urine more alkali, which helps to reduce the pain and frequency of urination caused by UTIs. Sadly, there is little existing evidence that this actually works. In fact, altering the normal acidity of urine might make it a better place for bacteria to grow. Because of this, it is best to avoid baking soda as a method for treating UTIs.

, Caffeine stimulates the bladder, creating a sensation of needing to go to the bathroom to urinate more frequently. It also decreases the bladder’s normal capacity so it holds less urine. This means that caffeine can actually worsen two symptoms of UTIs: urgency and frequency. Because of this, it is best to avoid letting your child have any caffeine (although this rule should generally followed at all times, whether UTIs are present or not)."

Make sure your child is maintaining personal hygiene.,
Avoid having your child take bubble baths if UTIs are an issue.,
Help your child stay hydrated and teach her or him that he/she should not hold in her urine if she has to go.,
Buy cotton underwear for your child.,
Talk about the link between intercourse and UTIs with your teenage daughter.",How to Treat Symptoms of a UTI in Children and Adolescents3," Teach your child how to keep his/her bottom clean. It is very important that your child knows to wash his/her bottom and genitals when taking a shower.If you have a daughter, teach her to wipe from front to back to avoid infection. In girls, bacteria from the colon readily colonize the area around the vagina and urethra, and then need to travel only a short distance through the urethra to the bladder to cause infection.

, Bathwater can quickly become contaminated with bacteria from other parts of the body, so your child should take showers rather than baths, especially if she has trouble with recurrent UTIs.


Bubble bath liquid can also irritate the area around the urethra, increasing chances of a UTI.

, Frequently emptying the bladder of urine can help it to remain bad bacteria-free. This is because urinating regularly can wash out bad bacteria that is trying to make its way to the bladder.


Staying hydrated will help to keep your child urinating regularly. You should try to teach your child to go to the toilet when he has to urinate, rather than ‘holding it in’ for a long time. Bacteria grows really well in urine, so emptying his bladder regularly will keep him UTI-free.

, If your child has recurrent UTIs, you should buy her cotton underwear that allows for airflow. Synthetic fabrics tend to not ‘breathe’ as well, which can cause moisture and irritation to occur., If you think your daughter may be sexually active, or may become sexually active, it is important to discuss safe health practices, including ways to avoid getting a UTI. It is important to talk to her about how spermicidal agents can kill good bacteria that can protect her against UTIs, which makes it more likely that bad bacteria will grow in that area. Make sure that she also knows that it is a good idea to urinate promptly after intercourse.


Talk to your daughter about getting a prescription for antibiotics if she is experiencing recurrent UTIs caused by sexual activity. Antibiotics are generally the best treatment in this situation so it is a good idea to discuss this option with her. The most commonly prescribed antibiotics for this purpose are nitrofurantoin (50 mg), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (40 to 200 mg), and cephalexin (500 mg)."

Know the difference between cystitis and pyelonephritis UTIs.,
Watch out for symptoms of cystitis so that you can stop them before they get worse.,
Look for signs of pyelonephritis to prevent further symptoms.",How to Treat Symptoms of a UTI in Children and Adolescents4," Cystitis refers to a UTI in the lower urinary tract including the bladder and urethra. These UTIs are more common than pyelonephritis, which is a UTI in the upper urinary tract and kidney. UTIs in the kidney are much more rare. If you are concerned your child has an upper UTI, take him or her to the hospital.

, In cystitis, the symptoms are primarily the result of inflammation/infection of the lining of the bladder wall and urethra. This may cause any of the following:


Pain or the sensation of ""burning"" during urination.
Pain felt in the abdomen just above the pubic bone.
More frequent urination during the day or at night and sometimes with only small amounts of urine produced. Note that the frequency may be masked by attempts to hold off on urination because of the pain. Frequency is often accompanied by the sudden urgent need to urinate.
Urine with an unusually strong odor, or appearing cloudy or bloody.
Low-grade fever.

, Infections of the kidney (pyelonephritis) are generally more serious infections although symptoms, particularly in infants and very young children, may not immediately point to the kidneys. If you think your child may have pyelonephritis, take him/her to the hospital. Symptoms of cystitis may be present in addition to:


A more severe generalized ill appearance.
High fever.
Nausea or vomiting.
Shaking chills.
Pain in the flank (the side of the back).

Explain helpful behaviors.,
Share stories with your child about people who help others.,
Be a strong role model.",How to Teach a Child to Help Others2," Although showing your child what to do is great, you'll want to communicate to your child what it means to be helpful and why it's important. Explain to them that helping others makes people feel good.


Brainstorm with your child ideas for how they can be helpful. This can be giving a gift to a grandparent, or offering to help a sibling or friend. Reinforce this behavior with compliments and tell them how proud you are that they are helping others. , When you explain to your child about the ways people help others, or share specific stories of such events in your community, your child can learn examples of how people care for one another. This can help them internalize what it means to be helpful and allows it to become part of their personality.


Find articles on the Internet or in your local newspaper about community events in which people help others, then read and share these stories with your child.
Watch television specials or news programs about people who have performed generous or charitable acts to help others.

, Children learn much of their behavior from watching adults. Rather than just telling your child about being helpful, you should act in a way that they can observe and learn helpful behaviors. When your child volunteers or does community activities, make sure to join them. Also, when you're around the house, use things you talk about or see on television as teaching moments.

Prioritize helping others.,
Expand the circle of who they care about.,
Help your child manage destructive feelings.",How to Teach a Child to Help Others3," Rather than just worrying about your kid's own happiness in all situations, teach them to put the well being of others first. Being kind and worrying about the well-being of others is fundamental to creating a helpful kid. You can do this by holding them to high ethical standards whether it is in sports, school, or any social situation. Watch how your kids interact with others at school, sporting events, or even with their siblings. Encourage them to be kind and discourage any destructive or bullying behaviors.

, Every child has a circle of friends and family that they naturally care about and therefore will be likely to help. The challenge is to get your kid to care about and help people outside this circle. This is important because your kids will encounter many different circles of people as they get older and will need to adapt to help them. Teach your kid to be friendly with people they see every day that aren't their friends or family. This can be a teacher, a bus driver, or employees you see at restaurants and stores. Also encourage your children to understand the struggles of people around the world by showing them newspaper and television stories.

, Their ability to help and care for others is often predicated on their ability to manage their own negative emotions. They can get overwhelmed with their own negative feelings and find it hard to act caring toward others. Teach your kids to calm down when they feel badly. Ask them to stop, take a deep breath and count to five. Every time they get upset, remind them to undergo this process again. This will help them have the tools to be conscious of other people's feelings, even when they are upset.

Combine 1 cup of your water and add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to the water. Stir the mixture well and pour it into a covered jar. You can store the saline solution at room temperature for up to three days until you're ready to use it.You can also buy a saline solution or saline nose drops from most pharmacies or drugstores. When used correctly, saline solutions and drops are safe for infants to use.;
, Fill a plastic blue baby suction bulb with the saline solution. Lay your baby on their back and tilt the baby's head back a little bit. Carefully cradle your baby's head so you have some control over dropping in the solution. Slowly and gently add two to three drops of the saline solution to each nostril.Be careful not to place the tip of the suction bulb too far into your baby's nose. The tip of the bulb should only go just past the opening of the nostrils.
Don't worry if your baby sneezes some of the solution out.

, Wipe around your baby’s nose since some of the solution may have leaked out or your baby might have sneezed. Keep your baby lying flat while you let the saline solution work. Wait about a minute and then empty the bulb into a sink or nearby basin.


Don't leave your baby unattended or let the baby move their head around too much before you suction out the solution.

, Squeeze the suction bulb a little and place the tip of the bulb back into the nose. The tip should only go about 1/4 inch into your baby's nostril. Release the pressure on the bulb which will suction out the mucus. Wipe the tip of the bulb off on a tissue. You can refill the bulb with more saline and repeat suctioning for each nostril. To thoroughly clean the bulb when you're done, wash it with warm soapy water. While most hospitals will send you home with a suction bulb, you should limit the number of times you suction a newborn's nose to two or three a day. Don't suction your older baby's nose more than four times a day or you may irritate the delicate lining of the nose.The most useful times to suction your baby's nose is before bedtime or feeding.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about suctioning.

, If you don't feel comfortable suctioning out your baby's nostrils, you can buy a saline nasal spray. Choose a nasal spray for infants from your pharmacy or drugstore. These nasal sprays are designed to be used without suction or using a bulb.Make sure to choose sprays with saline, and not medications.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions and be sure to wipe any extra saline from around your baby's nose when you're done using the spray.

, Elevating your baby's head with a thin pillow or rolled towel can help your baby get better sleep during a cold. But your baby shouldn't have any loose blankets or pillows in the crib. To safely elevate your baby's head, place the thin pillow or rolled towel underneath the mattress. Raising your baby's head slightly at night can make it easier to breathe.Always place your baby to sleep on their back to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

, If your baby is running a fever, make sure not to bundle on too many clothes. Dress your baby in a light layer of clothing, but check often to make sure your baby is warm enough. Touch your baby's ears, face, feet, and hands. If these feel warm or sweaty, your baby is probably too warm.If you dress your baby too warmly or in too many layers, it may make your baby uncomfortable and make it harder for your baby to fight the fever or your baby's fever may get worse.

, If your baby isn't feeling well, chances are your baby will be a little fussier and clingier. Try to take the time to give your baby extra attention and comfort while your baby is sick. If your baby is very young, try napping and babywearing most of the day. For an older baby, you might try snuggling and reading stories or doing puzzles.Encourage your baby to rest. Your baby needs extra rest to recover from the cough.

, Run a cool mist vaporizer or humidifier in the baby's room at night to introduce moisture into the room. The water vapor can keep your baby's airways open, making it easier to breathe. You can also introduce moisture into the air by leaving bowls of water around to evaporate.If you don't have a vaporizer, you can bring your baby into the bathroom while you run a hot shower. Close the doors and windows and sit in the bathroom while breathing in the steam. Take care to keep your baby away from the hot water and never leave them alone in the bathroom.

, Your baby needs extra fluids during a cold to stay hydrated and prevent coughing, especially if they have a fever. If you are nursing or giving your baby formula, try to feed more often so your baby gets more fluids. Nurse or feed your baby whenever your baby signals that they are hungry. Your baby may take smaller amounts more frequently, especially if your baby is having trouble breathing. If your baby eats solid foods, make certain the foods are soft and easily digestible.


Breast milk and extra fluids can thin the secretions in your baby's breathing passages so your baby can cough them out easier., If your baby is nursing, continue to give breast milk. But if your baby is drinking milk or eating dairy, you may want to reduce dairy products. Milk and dairy products can thicken the mucus your baby produces. Offer more water or diluted juice if your baby is over six months old.If your baby is under six months old and takes formula, continue giving the formula even if the powder is made with cow's milk. It's important that your baby keeps getting vital nutrients from their main source of food.
You should also avoid giving your baby honey before one year of age. This can prevent your baby from getting infant botulism.

, If your baby is coughing and running a fever, you can give infant acetaminophen. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions and only use infant acetaminophen if your baby is at least two months old. If your baby is at least six months old, you can use either acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Call your doctor for advice if:Your baby is under three months old and is running a fever of over 100.4°F (38°C)
Your baby over three months has a fever of over 102°F (38.9°C)
The fever lasts more than three days

, Most coughs caused by common colds will clear up on their own within 10 to 14 days. But your baby may need medical attention if:Your baby has bluish lips, fingers or toes — this requires immediate medical attention; call emergency services at once
Your baby under three months old has a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher or over 102°F (38.9°C) if over three months old
Your baby coughs up blood
The coughing is getting worse or is very frequent
Your baby has trouble breathing (gasps, breathes fast, wheezes, or takes strange breaths)
Your baby refuses to nurse or take formula (or you're not changing as many diapers)
Your baby vomits

Don’t neglect marketing.",How to Start a Home Daycare Center," There are many reasons why starting a daycare center is especially economically viable today. Are you a person who can help families adjust to these realities?The majority of families today do not fall into a male breadwinner-female homemaker model.
Shift work is an increasingly prominent feature of the new economy, with more and more people working nights and weekends.
In some two-parent households, one person works the day shift, and the other works the night shift
People are waiting longer to retire, which means that grandparents are less available to take care of children.;
, If you are thinking of starting a daycare center, you probably like working with children and are familiar with the tremendous amount of energy and commitment that this work requires, but that is not enough to run a successful business. There are a number of other qualities you will need:Professionalism and business acumen
Willingness to take risks
Ability to supervise staff
Access to financial resources
Organizational and record-keeping skills

, Once you have established a need for daycare in your community, think more specifically about the kind of services you want to provide. You’ve already decided to establish the center in your home rather than in a commercial space, but there are many other considerations to address.Look at demographic data. How many children are there under the age of five in your area? You can get this and other important pieces of information from the U.S. Census Bureau or local municipal centers and school systems. Also consider conducting a focus group of parents in your area.How many childcare centers already exist to serve these children? You can find this information through your municipal center's licensing office, local daycare referral agencies, or the phone book/Internet. Once you've established a comprehensive list, contact each center to find out how much they charge.Is there a need that these centers are not currently serving? Perhaps an age group or time frame is being neglected. If so, this could be your niche. You might want to consider the following options:Care during the traditional work day
Before or afterschool care
Evening, overnight, or weekend care
Care for a specific age group



, How much money will you need, and how long will it take you to save it? Alternatively, if you take out a loan, how long will it take to repay it? You will need to calculate both costs and revenues to determine the financial viability of your plan.What supplies will you need to purchase? Keep in mind that this is not a one-time cost. You will need to replenish supplies regularly. These include toys, games, books, arts and crafts, playground equipment, and more.
What alterations, if any, will you need to make to your house to make it safe for children?
What are the licensing and insurance fees in your state?
How much will it cost to provide meals and snacks for the children in your care?
How many children can you care for in your home?
Will you need to hire extra staff, and, if so, how much will you pay them?
How much will you charge parents for your services? Will it be enough to balance out costs? Conversely, will it be so much that it drives parents away?

, Your name should be simple, catchy, and memorable. Your legal structure will depend on the kind of center you hope to operate.Many home daycare centers are sole proprietorships. While this is the easiest and least expensive structure, it means that you will have to file both business and personal taxes together.
Consider becoming incorporated if you employ other people. You will likely need to pay attorney’s fees and higher taxes, but your own property will be protected. Becoming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) is also an option, but the parts of your home, furniture, materials, etc. that you use for the daycare will not be protected.Choose a partnership if you and a trusted colleague have complementary skill sets and wish to divide the labor. While this will allow you to participate in business decisions and receive any profits equally, you are also both responsible for any losses.

, Federal, state, and local governments provide a number of grants and affordable loans for people looking to start childcare businesses. See if you qualify for one of these programs to mitigate your start-up and operational costs., The process will not be the same everywhere, but it will have many common elements. Most states will have an office specifically dedicated to licensing childcare centers, most likely located in a division or department of family and/or child services. The U.S. Small Business Association can help you find your state's licensing requirements., In some states, you cannot even fill out an application until you have taken an orientation. This will often be free and available online. The orientation serves the following purposes:Helping you decide if you want to start a daycare center
Determining if you are qualified to start a daycare center
Informing you of what is required before you can open your center
Going over rules and safety requirements
Providing information about adult-child ratios and staffing issues
Introducing best practices in the care of children

, Your state's licensing requirements will tell you where to submit this, although in many cases it will be your county's licensing office. Along with basic identification and residential information, you may need to provide any or all of the following:Character references or recommendations
Medical information, including testing for tuberculosis
Information about any criminal convictions
Forms allowing background checks for anyone living in your house (and any staff) who is older than fourteen
A fee

, There are a number of areas you will need to know about to run a daycare center successfully. Before you become licensed, you will need to demonstrate your understanding of several different things:First aid, CPR, and emergency preparedness
Developmentally-appropriate discipline and activities
Child health, nutrition, and development
Making sure your home is safe for children
Communicating with parents

, Home-based daycare centers will need fire, theft, and liability insurance. You will also need to make sure that your homeowners’ insurance covers the materials you purchase for your business., Before you can open your business, inspectors will need to make sure both that your home is safe and healthy for children and that you have considered their educational, recreational, and disciplinary needs., This is where your organizational acumen comes in. You’ll need to keep track of every expenditure and form of income, both for your own solvency and for when it comes time to do taxes., In certain states, infant care is more expensive than college tuition. This situation forces parents to weigh very carefully whether or not they can afford to send their children to daycare, or if it makes more sense for one parent to stay home.Grants and loans can allow you to keep your prices down.
You may also be eligible for tax credits., Even with stringent licensing requirements, there is no guarantee that daycare centers provide high-quality care. Set yourself apart by establishing yourself as an expert in children’s developmental, educational, and nutritional needs. Consider taking classes at a local community college, which will usually come with a modest charge., Parents will not know what makes your center special if you do not let them know. Consider a weekly or biweekly newsletter that highlights the activities their children have been engaging in. It is even better if you can provide pictures!

, Many childcare providers say that demand is so high that they often have a waiting list without doing any marketing. However, if you are just starting out, you want to establish your reputation as a professional business.Look into graphic design and writing professionals in your area.
If you are working with someone who has children, you may even be able to trade childcare services for their services.
As you are designing your marketing plan, think about the same questions you considered when deciding what kind of service to provide (and make sure that your materials describe these specific services to avoid any confusion).

What audience are you trying to reach?
How will your service be different from, and better than, the one they are currently using or others they might be considering?
What characteristic(s) do you want to emphasize? Caring? Flexibility? Affordability? Choose the most important ones, and use them to craft a consistent and appealing image.

Target specific behaviors.,
Make the process clear and reasonable.,
Prioritize visibility and immediacy.,
Choose rewards your child values.,
Keep it positive.",How to Use a Behavior Chart1," Especially when you’re just starting out with trying a behavior chart, it is advisable to narrow your focus to a single problem behavior, or at most a couple of related ones. Trying to adjust too many behaviors at once — and keep track of the progress — is likely to become too confusing and overwhelming for everyone involved.The younger the child, the more helpful it is to focus on one thing at a time. Otherwise, they will most likely end up confused and disinterested.
So, if your kindergartener has trouble sharing, saying “thank you,” and brushing their teeth before bed, choose one of these behaviors — dental habits, for instance — to track on the chart.
Also, the more specific, the better. Go with “say thank you to people,” not “be nicer to people.”;
, When it comes to behavior charts, simpler is almost always better. Make the chart itself clear — a grid on a big sheet of paper, some clear labels, and some colorful stickers to indicate successes — and the process of earning stickers equally simple.Don’t get bogged down in negotiations over what counts as sticker-worthy, or offering half-stickers for “sort-of” good behavior. Explain exactly what will earn a sticker.
Explain the rules in a way that everyone can understand: “Every time you help set the table for dinner, you get a sticker. Once you have seven stickers, we will spend an hour at the playground together.”

, Most kids seem to follow the old axiom, “out of sight, out of mind.” Put the chart somewhere prominent — on the fridge, near the door, etc. — and don’t delay in adding stickers for good behavior. You want your child to clearly associate the good behavior with being one step closer to their reward.If you’re away from home when the positive behavior occurs, make a note — mental or actual, as necessary — and immediately apply a sticker to the chart when you get back.

, For the reward system to work, the reward has to be worth the effort. Most smaller kids will likely see a five-cent lollipop as more valuable than a quarter, for instance. Talk to your child about the types of rewards that seem fair, reasonable, and properly motivating.Of course, you have to make the final judgment on what constitutes a good reward. An occasional ice cream cone might work, but frequent rewards of junk food may simply be trading one bad habit for another.
For younger kids, small, more frequently achievable rewards are best. Older kids are more able to comprehend working for a longer period of time to earn a bigger reward.

, Behavior charts are based on positive reinforcement — good behavior is rewarded, while bad behavior earns nothing towards the goal. Don’t take stickers away for misbehavior, or keep track of demerits toward a punishment; the behavior chart should be a positive experience all around.If you child engages in behaviors that must be addressed more assertively — perhaps by way of specified punishments — do so separately from the chart process.
Focusing on positive rewards for positive behaviors is more likely to build your child’s self-esteem, while emphasizing punishment for negative behaviors can have the opposite effect.

"
"
Simplify things with a “single behavior” chart.,
Advance on to a “multiple behavior” chart as needed.,
Use a chore chart to encourage completion of household responsibilities.,
Try a homework chart that is tailored to your child’s level.",How to Use a Behavior Chart2," This is a good way to start with using a behavior chart, especially with younger kids. This type of chart is dedicated to adjusting a single behavior, such as “saying thank you” or “sharing your toys.” You can download sample versions, or simply make a grid with the days of the week down the first column, a space for daily totals in the last column, and the number of columns you expect to need in between (perhaps five to seven) for placing stickers when the good behavior occurs.Keep the chart in a prominent place, and place earned stickers on the chart as soon as possible — or let your child do it. Do regular progress reports each day and an end-of-day tally with your kid. Especially for younger kids, use immediate rewards that can be earned quickly (daily, for instance). Five “thank yous” in a day could equal doing a special puzzle together, for example.

, These charts are only slightly more complicated, and work best with kids who have multiple and related behaviors that need addressed. For instance, they are great options for kids who struggle with either morning or bedtime routines. Once again, create a grid with the days of the week in the left column and totals on the right. In between, create columns for each particular element of the related behaviors / routines (bathing, putting on pajamas, brushing your teeth, etc.).Add stickers or checkmarks upon completion of each task, and keep a daily tally in the far right column and a weekly individual task tally in the bottom row of the grid.
Keeping both daily and per-task tallies provides more opportunities for encouragement and rewards. You can, for instance, reward each time an entire routine is completed properly, as well as when an individual task is completed satisfactorily at least five times in a week.

, It is a good idea for kids of any age to have age-appropriate chores around the house, as they help teach the importance of both individual and shared responsibilities. A simple chore chart can have a days-of-the-week column on the left, and columns to the right for each individual chore the child has (with a couple of blank columns for occasional or one-time chores).Since specific chores might vary day-to-day, you may want to determine a set number of daily checkmarks/stickers as the prize threshold.
Be clear with your kid that the criteria for rewards isn’t set in stone. If it’s too difficult or too easy for your child to achieve rewards, clearly explain the adjustments you’re making — and perhaps create a new chart with some minor cosmetic changes to indicate the “fresh start.”

, If the behavior you need to address is your child’s laxness in completing school assignments on time, a chart can once again be a useful tool. For small kids, a simpler grid system with single boxes for each day’s homework may suffice. For older children, you may want to use a more complex grid system broken down by day, subject, and progress toward task completion. Look for samples online.Consider working with your child’s teacher in using this chart. You might create a somewhat smaller, more portable version that your child can bring to and from school, so that the teacher can check off assignments that are turned in.

"
"
Don’t confuse rewards with bribes.,
Accept that some people oppose behavior charts altogether.,
Use rewards to build skills and strategies for success.,
Prioritize social over material rewards.",How to Use a Behavior Chart3," Some adults scoff at the reward element that is inherent in most behavior charts, based on the notion that you’re simply bribing a child to do what they should be doing anyway. There is a difference, however.Bribes are offered (or demanded) on-the-spot as a “carrot”: “Fine, I’ll give you a dollar if you’ll just clean up your toys!”
Rewards are clearly established ahead of time, with a clear process toward earning them: “If you pick up your toys at the end of the day for a week, you will earn an extra hour of TV time.”

, While there is plenty of support among child development experts for the thoughtful use of behavior charts, there are also many advocates, professionals, and everyday parents who are opposed. They claim that these so-called “sticker charts” create “transactional relationships” in which every task must have a tangible, material value attached to it.Essentially, they say it eliminates the notion of doing something because it is the right thing to do, and encourages kids to instead ask “what’s in it for me?”.
Seek out all the advice and expertise you can, but ultimately it’s your decision as a parent whether or not behavior charts are right for your family.

, Should you choose to utilize behavior charts, stay actively involved in your child’s efforts to complete tasks and achieve rewards. Offer advice and encouragement, but don’t do the work for them. Remember, your best bet for short- and long-term success is to set clear, realistic goals; use simple, immediate rewards; and help your child develop problem-solving strategies to achieve their goals.For instance, work with your child to come up with ways to streamline the process of putting away their toys (perhaps by storing items by type) or doing their math homework (like setting up an orderly workspace and process for approaching the problems).

, When you think of offering rewards to kids, the first things to come to mind are probably material things like candy, toys, or money. In truth, though, social rewards like praise, fun activities, and time spent together are at least as desirable to kids and may reduce the “transactional” nature of the process.For small children, saying “You did such a good job cleaning your room — let’s go play whatever game you want” will have a deeper and more lasting impact than a lollipop. And, taking your younger teen to that concert they really want to attend can do more for your relationship than giving them money for new clothes.
That said, don’t make spending time with you something your kids need to earn by way of a behavior chart. Reward them by spending your time together doing something that will be particularly appealing to them.

Sit down with the child.,
Get right to the point.,
Don't be afraid to show your emotions, but try to keep them in check as you explain.,
Explain mental illness or depression simply.,
Make sure the child understands that nobody could have saved the loved one.,
Be sure the child knows that the suicide victim loved them.",How to Explain a Family Member's Suicide to a Child," Start by gently telling the child that you need to talk with them about the loved one. Your tone of voice will signal that this is something important. If your child is confused, reassure them that they are not in trouble.


Choose a time when you can handle it—after you've had time to absorb the news and cry.;
, Beating around the bush is not only scary to children but to everyone. Explain to your child what happened.


For example, ""Uncle was very sad and nothing seemed to help him to feel better. Everyone tried very hard to help, but no one was able to get there in time, and he killed himself. They call it suicide when someone kills themselves.""
Add a religious component if your family is religious. Tell the child that ""uncle is not with us any more. He died and went to heaven.""

, It's okay if you are obviously sad, or even if you cry—the child needs to know it's okay for everyone to miss the loved one, and to cry and grieve openly and honestly.


If the child asks about your emotions, explain. ""I'm feeling sad because I loved your uncle very much. I'm sad that he was hurting so badly, and I'm going to miss him a lot."" This helps your child know that it's okay to feel sad and to talk about emotions.
Just don't allow yourself to get very emotional - it's scary to kids. They want to see adults as being in control. You want the child to know that you are, although grieving, in control, and able to look after them.

, If the child is still not understanding, tell them that ""Uncle was very sick, and this was a sickness, not of the heart or lungs, but of the mind. He got sick very fast, and there wasn't time to fix it."" Answer any questions as clearly as you can.

, Be sure to stress that it is nothing that the child did that caused or allowed this to happen. It's common for suicide survivors to feel guilt, and that includes children. Tell the child ""Nobody could have prevented uncle's decision, and nobody did anything wrong."" If the child asks about whether they may be at fault, ensure they know that they should not feel guilty.

, A child needs to know that the person who died loved them, but that because of the illness, they were in so much pain that they couldn't express it well. But do stress that sometimes, love is not enough to cure all ills. No matter how much we love or are loved, mental illness is powerful and, even though many people can be helped, sometimes help does not come in time.

Know when to see a doctor.",How to Stop Your Child from Wetting the Bed," Your child may have mastered staying dry during the day, but that does not mean that he or she will be ready to stay dry at night. For most children, it’s fine to keep them in diapers (or pull-up style disposable underwear) until they start waking up dry most mornings.


Understand that developmentally, each child is different. Some children can stay dry at night during the toddler years; others are still having accidents at age six or beyond. Try not to compare your son or daughter to other children.;
, Once you decide to give up nighttime diapers, you’ll want to prepare for the inevitable accidents. Get a waterproof cover to put under the sheets but above the mattress, to protect it from damage.

, When your child has an accident in the middle of the night, it’s helpful to have clean sheets and pajamas nearby. That way, you can simply remove the soiled sheets, wipe the waterproof cover with a cloth, put clean sheets on the bed, and help your child change into fresh sleepwear.


As your child gets older, you may want to enlist his or her help in this routine. Most preschoolers can remove soiled sheets, put on clean pajamas, and help you put clean linens on the bed.

, Accidents will happen – and, indeed, they may happen very frequently at first – and it’s important that you support your child and take them in stride. Tell your child that learning to stay dry at night is a process and that it’s okay if it takes some time.

, Let your child drink plenty of fluids during the day, and make sure he or she drinks a glass of water with dinner, but try to avoid liquids after that.


Take special care to avoid caffeinated drinks (like sodas). These can increase the production of urine.

, Encourage your child to empty his or her bladder immediately before bedtime. This will reduce the likelihood of a full bladder overnight.

, Overcoming bedwetting is often a matter of agreement between the bladder and the brain; make this possible by sticking to a routine so that your child’s body “learns” to hold urine during specified times.

, Certain foods may cause allergic reactions in your child, even if they do not produce a rash or other external signs, or may irritate the bladder or otherwise increase the odds of an accident. If your child is struggling to stay dry at night, consider keeping a food journal and noting any correlation between certain foods and nighttime accidents.


Particular culprits seem to be spicy and acidic foods, which can irritate the bladder, and milk and other dairy products, which can cause sleepiness and make it harder to wake up when the bladder is full.

, Some experts believe low levels of calcium and magnesium may contribute to bedwetting. In addition to dairy products, calcium and magnesium are found in bananas, sesame seeds, beans, fish, almonds, and broccoli.

, Until your child learns to wake up and go to the bathroom when his or her bladder is full, you might set an alarm and interrupt his or her sleep purposefully. You can start by waking your child up every two or three hours and extend this period gradually over time, until your child is sleeping through the entire night and waking up dry.

, Feeling cold can increase the need to urinate, so make sure your child is warm enough while sleeping.

, If your child continues to struggle with bedwetting, keep a detailed journal of his or her accidents, including their timing. You may notice patterns, which will make it easier to pinpoint causes and wake your child at an appropriate time to prevent accidents.

, Never punish a child for bedwetting, which may very well be completely out of his or her control. Instead, stick to praise and positive reinforcement for dry nights.

, Have your child take a bath with 500 grams of salt dissolved in the water before bed. Minerals from the saltwater may reduce infection, strengthen the immune system, and detoxify the body. This step might be useful if your child has a tendency to develop bladder infections.


Ideally, the temperature of the water should be about body temperature: 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 degrees Celsius.

, Add fresh or dried parsley to boiling water; let it stand for five to ten minutes, then strain it, add a few drops of lemon, and stir in a teaspoon of honey. Parsley tea guards against urinary tract infections and supplies calcium and magnesium. Only offer the tea in the mornings, though; it could increase urination and lead to more accidents at nighttime.

, Allow cornsilk to dry for several days, then make a tea by covering it with boiling water and letting it stand for ten minutes. Cornsilk tea may strengthen the muscles of the bladder and remove toxins from it. Again, offer the tea only in the mornings, as drinking it at night could cause more accidents.

, Boil oats in a liter of cold water, then let the tea sit for an hour before straining and drinking. Oats are rich in calcium and magnesium and may help calm the nervous system, which can help prevent accidents caused by stress. As with other teas, offer oat tea to your child only in the mornings.

, Bedwetting is usually normal and does not typically need to be addressed by a physician. However:


See a pediatrician if your child is older than seven years old and still wetting the bed. A pediatrician can help rule out other causes (including urinary tract and bladder infections) and give you advice for helping your child stay dry.
See a pediatrician if your child is older than five years old and still having accidents during the daytime as well as at night. By five years old, most children should be able to control urination. If yours can’t yet, see a pediatrician to rule out physical causes and get advice for treatment, but be aware that this problem can be genetic: you may simply have to wait it out.
See a pediatrician and/or a child psychologist if your child begins to wet the bed again after a long period of dry nights. Under these circumstances, bedwetting may be linked to trauma or stress: the death of someone close to the child, divorce of his or her parents, the arrival of a new baby, or anything else frightening or disruptive.

Show up to every event in your child's life that you can.",How to Ensure a Child Feels Loved," Consistent attention and affection is the key to happiness. You can never spoil a child with too much love.;
, Try to cuddle and read to them every night. If that is not possible, do it in the morning. Kids love for you to sit on the floor and build with them or create something with them. Take time everyday and just sit with them and talk. The important thing is let them know you enjoy being with them. It is the highlight of your day.

, Even if it bores you silly! Children just love routine because it makes them feel safe. Start a solid meal routine and explain to them why they need to eat healthy foods. Make a bedtime routine as well. Plan an enjoyable bath and reading time.

, Create a loving family for your child in which adults fuss, talk, play, brag and take pictures of them. Always talk in loving terms about your child. Watch your words at all times. Many adults make the mistakes of thinking children can not hear them so talk about them in a positive way and let them hear you. An example is you are on the phone and you say to your relative or friend how happy you are with the child because (and name a reason). If you are talking to other parents, never put down your own child. Just compliments.

, As they are growing up, they are trying to figure out their place in life. Tell them how happy you are they are here with you. Tell them they will always have a permanent place with you in life. Discuss your pregnancy or adoption in positive joyful terms. They don't need to hear about the 20 hour labor or how their real mother did not want them.

, Keep the home life serene. Having a crisis all the time or fighting constantly is extremely stressful to any child. Put their needs first, not yours. If you are living a selfish life, now is the time to stop. Always put your child's needs first, before a boyfriend or girlfriend without question.

, Model upbeat and positive attitudes. Stop complaining about how horrible your day is or what a terrible life you had. This is your time to make an impact on a young life, so do it in an honorable way. Be a role model all the time and show good values and common sense.

, Tell them they are the most important thing in the world to you. Hold their hands as you walk in a crowd. Carry them when they are small. Talk to them about the dangers in life, when they are ready. Don't ignore your child's fears, but comfort them instead.

, Don't corner a child if they make an error and always give them a way out to save face. If your child does lie to you, tell them that you know in your heart that they are not the type of person who lies, explain that you understand they did it to avoid getting in trouble, but you expect them to always tell the truth. If a child keeps lying, then they may be looking for attention. Rethink how you can make them feel better about themselves. Come up with positive nicknames for your child such as ""Honest Mike"" or ""Trustworthy Susan"".

, They are not a ""mini you'. They are a human being, that needs to be allowed to slowly grow into a healthy happy adult. Forget your dreams and wishes that you wish to impose on them. Let them have a childhood that doesn't reflect you pressuring them to become what you want them to be. Children are forced into feeling they must be perfect or ""fill in the blank"" to be loved. Do not do that to any child. Loving unconditionally means loving them as they are not what you want them to be.

, Make a wall in your home that is all about them. School pictures, art work, class work and pictures of you with them doing fun things. Change it from time to time. Show if off to family and friends.

You don't have to buy coloring books from a store. Search online for free coloring book pages that you can print out. If you don't have a home computer or printer, find out if your local library has any available for use.
There isn't an age limit for coloring books, but most children lose interest by the end of elementary school.
You can engage with a child who is coloring by asking questions. For children from ages three through five, try asking the names of the colors being used.You can also ask about the picture being colored: ""What/Who is that?""
Be sure to provide only water soluble, non-toxic coloring utensils.
Avoid markers and pens when using commercial coloring books. Many coloring books are printed on a type of paper that markers can bleed through, ruining the picture on the next page.;
, People of all ages love to draw. Give the kids some printer paper or a sketch book and some drawing utensils.


Toddlers can enjoy ""drawing"" with scribbles. Encourage them to develop their creativity and motor skills.
While a child is drawing, ask about the picture being made. Don't directly ask what the drawing is ""supposed"" to be, since this may discourage a child. Instead, ask the child to tell you about what he or she is drawing.Older kids may not like being asked so many questions. Save them for when the child shows you a finished drawing.

, There are thousands of different activities children of all ages can enjoy. Check out websites and blogs run by parents and teachers for ideas. These can be time-honored traditions or completely unique projects. Some examples are:


Paper crafts like snowflakes

Making pet rocks
Fingerpaints

Store-bought crafts like models and jewelry kits

Read aloud to young kids.,
Read with elementary school-aged kids.,
Help older kids to read on their own.,
Encourage kids to make up their own stories.",How to Entertain Kids2," Until kids learn how to read on their own, it's best to sit down and read to them out loud.


Select bright, colorful picture books that don't have a lot of text.
The younger the child, the slower you should go. Speak clearly and slowly, pausing at each page.
Consider letting the child decide when it's time to turn to the next page.
Older kids can still enjoy being read to if it's a more complicated story, especially before going to sleep.
Reading to kids early and often stimulates their brains and helps them learn verbal skills., Once kids start learning how to read, usually at five or six, encourage them to take a more active role.


Keep reading the entire story to a child who is just learning how to identify simple words. However, before turning the page, try pointing to a word or two and ask if the child can read the word. Stick to easy words like ""red"" and ""dog"" at first.
Once a child learns how to read simple sentences, encourage him or her to read picture books to you.
If he or she gets stuck on a difficult word, encourage the child to sound it out. If that doesn't work, gently tell the child how to say the word., As their reading skills improve, you don't always have to entertain kids by reading to them directly. Instead, encourage independence by reading to themselves. As an adult, it's your job to make sure they have what they need.


Stock up on age-appropriate books and keep them where the kids can always grab one to read.
Take the kids on a trip to bookstores and/or libraries and let them pick out their own books.
Participate in local community reading events and book clubs for kids.
If you can't find a children's reading program in your area, you can try starting one yourself. You may even be able to apply for grants to help fund these activities.Give older kids access to a dictionary to use when they come across unknown words.

, Reading and listening to stories is fun, but making up your own can be just as entertaining, especially for young kids. Ask the kids to tell you a story.


You can teach them how to tell a story by telling a simple story first. Then ask for a story from them.
If you're entertaining a few kids, try playing a game where everyone tells the story. Go in a circle and take turns, adding on to what the last person said. If one kid tends to hog the spotlight, try adding a rule to limit each turn to one minute or one sentence to include everyone equally.
Once kids start to learn how to read and write, they can begin writing down simple stories. Give them paper or a notebook to write in.
Older kids may begin to write their own novel-length stories. At this stage, it may be a good idea to let them use a computer to type their stories rather than handwrite them."
"
Play sports and other outdoor activities.,
Have a few board games and/or a deck of cards on hand.,
Play video games with your kids but enforce limits.",How to Entertain Kids3," If you're entertaining high-energy kids, they are likely to favor more intense activities like sports. If you don't have a big yard, take a field trip to a local playground or park.


Keep the kids busy, active, and well-socialized by signing them up for an organized sports team.
When stuck indoors, you can get energy out with dancing to fun music.
If you're entertaining a group of kids, you can suggest a game of tag or hide-and-go-seek. You can join in on a game of tag, but don't play hide-and-go-seek unless other responsible adults are present. You shouldn't let kids out of your sight, and if it's your turn to be ""it"" you would have to. Instead, you can be the game's ""referee"" to make sure everyone plays fair.
Take kids on hiking trips and nature trails. Spending the weekend camping (even if it's just in your own backyard) is also a great option.
Cool down during the summer at your local public pool.
All kids, regardless of energy level, should get some exercise and time outdoors to stay healthy. Children and adolescents should generally get at least an hour of physical activity each day., A classic part of childhood, board games help entertain kids while teaching them valuable life-skills like taking turns.


Simple card games like Go Fish are easy to teach to even very young children.
You or the kids may want to set ""house rules"" on certain games that may not be in the rule book. While this may be fun for most children, it may be frustrating for others.
Make sure the games are age-appropriate. A 10-year-old is likely to get bored with Candyland, while Risk would probably frustrate a kindergartener.
If you can't afford to buy board games, your local library may have some available to check out. If you borrow board games, make sure the kids treat them well and avoid losing pieces., While video games often have a bad reputation among parents, they are a great way to entertain kids when played in moderation.


Join in on multiplayer games.
Keep the kids active on rainy days with video games that have a physical component.
Make sure to pay attention to game ratings and content warnings. Video games are just like movies; they're not all kid-friendly. It's generally best to stick to E-rated games, especially ones specifically made for children.
Studies have shown that playing up to an hour of video games per day is beneficial to children. However, there can be some negative effects when daily game time climbs to over three hours."

Attend family counseling.,
Ask about group therapy.,
Do an online search for resources.,
Engage in parent resources.,
Consider joining a caregiver support group.",How to Find Counseling for Children of Incarcerated Parents," Most public schools offer therapeutic services. This can be with a guidance counselor or with a school psychologist.Seeking services within the school can be effective on many fronts. For one, counseling offered by the school is free and occurs during school time. You don’t need to find time to drop off and pick up your child before or after work.


A school counselor can also direct you to community services and outside resources as necessary.Even if you homeschool your child, you can still receive counseling services through the school.;
, After meeting with a school counselor, your child may begin individual counseling.The school counselor may want to meet with you first to discuss how the child is doing, what specific problems are present, and what goals you have for treatment. Then, the counselor will likely meet with your child once each week for counseling during class time.


Therapy may include ways to cope with difficult feelings, how to control anger, or other areas that are relevant for the child’s treatment.

, School counselors and school psychologists often run groups for children. These groups meet during school time and consist of other children from within the school, and the counselor runs the group. Some common themes of groups are social skills, anger management, divorce, grief, and self-esteem.Contact your child’s school or school counselor and see what groups are available. Choose which group may be best for your child.

, Your child may need multiple services at school to succeed. Work with your child’s teacher, school counselor, and principal to gain the best understanding and treatment for your child. Your child’s teacher may enact a behavior plan or academic support plan.Having the support of multiple people and sources at school can surround your child with support and encourage him or her to do well at school.


Ask if there are people your child can go to for support during the day.This can include the school counselor as well as the teacher, principal, or teacher’s aid. It’s important for the child to know he or she is supported at school.

, A community therapist may be a good option, since you may find one that specializes in difficult family situations or specifically with children dealing with incarcerated parents. Individual counseling at a clinic can help your child work through difficult emotions and find coping strategies.A therapist at a clinic may work with both you and the child during sessions, although most of the time will be spent with the child.


To find a therapist, call your insurer and find a therapist who is covered in your network. You can also ask if there are services specifically for families affected by incarceration.
The therapist will involve you in the initial meeting to ask you what goals you have for treatment, what behaviors you’d like to see improved, and how to improve life for the child.
The goal of therapy may be helping the child cope and understand the situation.

, Family therapy can benefit both your child and your whole family. Dealing with incarceration can be difficult for the family with changes in roles, dealing with loss, and the many changes that occur suddenly. Because the incarceration affects the whole family, you may want to seek treatment as a unit. Family therapy can help your family go through this hard time together and find comfort and support together.Reach out to your insurer to find a family therapist. You can also check any services provided by your insurance or in the community to serve those affected by incarceration.

, Many clinics offer group therapy for children. There may even be a group for children of incarcerated parents or for children dealing with difficult family situations. Groups are run by one or two therapists and generally involve small groups of children (or children and their caretakers) that meet weekly to work on specific issues. Group therapy can be a great way for the child to meet other children with similar stories and recognize that he or she is not alone.Call a local clinic and ask about opportunities for group therapy for children.

, You can find many websites offering help for those dealing with incarceration, whether it be for loved ones, partners, or children. Some major cities have specific resources geared toward individuals and families dealing with incarceration in the family. Do a web search to see what resources are available to you in your state, and ask what resources are available specifically to children.


This government website links out to state and local resources: https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/supporting/support-services/prisoners/

This website also has resources for children and family of an incarcerated loved one: https://nrccfi.camden.rutgers.edu/resources/directory/


, An important part of helping a child cope with the incarceration of one parent is to provide stability as the caretaker. Many parenting resources are available to caretakers, such as Pathfinders and Parenting Inside Out. These programs serve to help children and families cope with the loss of a loved one due to incarceration and help lead to better outcomes for these children.In addition to finding counseling and therapeutic resources, find resources to help you be a caretaker to the child.

, Caregivers face specific challenges related to having a loved one incarcerated and also looking after children. You may experience sudden role changes, financial instability, and the emotional impact of seeing a loved one be incarcerated. It can be difficult to tell children about their parent and deal with the child’s understanding and emotions around missing the parent. For this reason, support groups exist to support caregivers.


You can find an online community or find a local support group, such as through the Children of Incarcerated Parents Partnership, located in Maryland."

Respond to your baby’s needs.,
Allow your baby to explore through play.,
Acknowledge your baby’s accomplishments.,
Help your child push their boundaries.,
Nurture your baby.,
Create a safe environment for your baby.",How to Develop Social Skills in Children1," Babies are unable to tell you what they want directly. This means you will need to pay attention to the actions and non-verbal cues that your baby gives. When you know what your baby needs, give it to them. If that doesn’t work then you may have misinterpreted their needs, and you should try something else.For example, if your two week old is crying and isn’t soothed by their bottle, they may need to burp instead of eat. Try burping your baby, and if that doesn’t sooth them, move to the next thing (such as rocking), and so on.;
, Adults sometimes make the mistake of assuming children play just to pass the time. This is not true. In fact, children gain most of their skills through playing. This is how they explore the world around them, and it should be encouraged for them to learn new skills while playing.For example, you could play peek-a-boo with your child. While on one hand it is a simple game, on the other hand they learn that you will go away and come back. They also learn to be excited when they see you.

, While your baby is exploring their world through play, they will learn new skills. It is up to you as a parent to reinforce those skills by giving your baby positive feedback. This makes your baby feel confident and secure in their development.While it might not seem like much work to hold a bottle, it is quite the feat for your six month old. Tell them that you are proud of the things they are able to do.

, All of the skills we need in life have to be learned. Sometimes, this means pushing the limits a bit. You should play with your baby and challenge them to do something that is a little harder than they are used to. For example, if your baby likes to roll a ball, try making them roll the ball into a set of pins or a basket.Be sure to keep this light and do not make it competitive.

, Babies thrive on attention from their parents. You should hold your baby, and talk or sing to your baby often. This interaction will help them feel loved. These things need to be done both when the baby is calm and cute and when the baby is crying and being fussy., Two key elements of making babies feel safe are to respond to their needs as soon as you can and to make their day predictable. By responding quickly when your baby cries, you are teaching them to trust you. Keeping a regular schedule for your baby helps them to predict their day and keeps them from being confused and frustrated.When you are dealing with a newborn, you typically need to respond in an “on demand” way. Babies usually do not adopt a schedule until sometime between three and six months.

Teach your toddler about feelings.,
Observe your toddler’s feelings.,
Discuss limits with your toddler.,
Encourage your toddler to make friends.",How to Develop Social Skills in Children2," It is important to discuss feelings with your toddler. Through your discussion of how they feel, they begin to learn words associated with those feelings and can later use those words to talk out their feelings. This will help them transition to talking about feelings instead of acting out their frustrations.You might say something like “I know you are sad that it is bedtime, but we can play with your toys again tomorrow.”

, It is important to observe how your children play and act out to understand their feelings. By watching and understanding your toddler’s feelings you can more effectively discuss them. You can also teach your toddler to express their feelings in more socially constructive ways.If your toddler is angry, you might say something like “I know that you are upset that the candy is gone, but you cannot hit people. Instead, you can show us you are upset by taking a deep breath and just telling us you are upset.”

, Toddlers need to understand what is expected of them. They will naturally push the boundaries, but if you set firm limits and give explanations for those limits, most toddlers will begin to respect the rules. This gives them the structure and boundaries they need to feel secure.Emphasize the positive aspects of rules with your toddler. For example, explain that the your child must get enough sleep tonight so that he or she can have more fun tomorrow.

, Babies do not interact very well with each other, but once children start to reach the toddler phase, they begin to socialize a bit with other kids. Encourage your toddler to make friends, and teach him or her how to do things like introduce him or herself. This is one of the early milestones in socializing your child.Do not be surprised if your toddler plays more “beside” the other children than they play “with” the other children. Parallel play is common in this stage.

Provide your preschooler with limits.,
Encourage your preschooler to be independent.,
Facilitate social interactions with children.,
Interact with your child as a role model.,
Put your child in cooperative situations.",How to Develop Social Skills in Children3," During the preschool years, children really begin to explore the world around them. Their curiosity may seem to have no limit, so you must set the limits. Explain to your preschooler why they must stay in the yard and not cross the street alone, for example., While limits are important, so are expectations. It is okay to help your preschooler do things like button and zip their clothes. You should start expecting them to dress themselves, though (or at least try). Rather than making these tasks a chore, be sure to frame them in a positive way that keeps your preschooler excited about being independent.You can also set expectations such as helping to set or clear the table, picking up toys, and putting dirty clothes in a hamper.

, At this age, children are beginning to take turns and play together even more than in the toddler phase. You should encourage this social interaction by letting your child play with neighbors and friends. This will begin to build their confidence to make more friends as well as their social skills.Once you have created the social environment (a play date for example) back away and let your child interact with the other children. Only intervene when necessary.

, While interacting with peers is an important part of learning social skills, it isn’t foolproof. Other preschoolers that your child plays with are likely to have roughly the same social skills as your preschooler. This means that more advanced social skills will come from modeling older kids and adults. As a parent, you should try role playing games and take charge in your helping your child learn to be social.For example, preschoolers may practice saying please and thank you while they play, but may need your guidance to understand that they should make eye contact when they do so.

, This can often mean just letting your child play with other preschoolers, but it helps to be more intentional about it sometimes. Design scenarios where your child has to work with someone else to complete a task. Asking your child and a friend to do a chore together before they play can be a good way to teach cooperation and teamwork."

Listen to your child’s conflicts objectively.,
Empathize with your child.,
Help your child express how they feel without attacking someone else.,
Teach self advocacy to your child.",How to Develop Social Skills in Children4," Do not get overly emotional when your child has a conflict with another child. If you react rashly, you will be teaching your child to do the same. Instead, ask questions or make statements about the situation that allow your child to see the conflict from both sides.You might say something like “I’m sorry that your friend took the ball from you. He must have felt like it was his turn to have the ball, but you felt like it was still your turn.”

, While you do not want to give your child the impression that they are always right or that they have no fault in conflicts, you should show that you care how they feel. Do not dismiss your child’s feelings. Instead, relate to their feelings and help them relate those feelings to how others might feel., Children are often confused and frustrated by their emotions. This can lead to hitting, yelling at, or blaming someone else for their frustration. Teach your child techniques like taking a deep breath and counting to ten, then saying what they need to say politely.If your child comes crying to you because a friend wouldn’t play the game they want, you could say something like “I know it’s hard when other people don’t want to do the things you want to do. That makes me upset sometimes, too. Do you think your friends feel upset when you don’t play their games?”

, Part of teaching your child to cooperate with others is to teach them how to express their wants and needs. Whether in the classroom, at home, or on the playground, children will need to voice their wants and opinions. You must teach them to do this effectively and respectfully so that they may advocate for their own needs.This could be something like reassuring your child that it is okay to raise their hand and ask to go to the restroom in class, if that’s what the need to do.

Choose a social skill to work on.,
Make the skill into a rule.,
Show the children how to follow the rule.,
Allow the children to practice the rule.,
Communicate with parents about what their children are learning.",How to Develop Social Skills in Children5," It is important to target specific things in the classroom. Choose a skill and set a goal for the children to reach. The skill might be something like waiting until discussion is finished to sharpen a pencil. While this seems trivial, it teaches children to respect and listen to what someone else is saying.Be sure that you are choosing skills that are within the children’s ability to understand. Skills for kindergarteners will be different from sixth graders, for example.

, Children may not say that they like rules, but this is what they need to be successful. For the pencil sharpening example, the rule might be something like “You may only sharpen your pencils when everyone has finished speaking.” The children will understand the rule and begin to follow it, though they may need reminded from time to time.The “rule” takes the skill from being merely a suggestion of how to be courteous, to a clear message about what is expected.

, The first part of this is to role play. Pretend you are one of the children you teach and show them what you expect. The other part is to follow the rule yourself. If the children are not allowed to sharpen a pencil while you are talking to them, then you may not sharpen a pencil when they are talking to you., Have some “test runs” with your new rule. For example, you might give out a few unsharpened pencils and let the children try to sharpen them at appropriate times through the day. Do not punish them for mistakes, but coach them through what should have been done.It is important that the children are comfortable with the rule. If it appears that they do not understand after the first practice run, give it some time and do another one.

, Parents can do a lot to reinforce what is going on in the classroom. Most parents genuinely want to see their child do well. If you keep them informed about what is happening in the classroom and why, you’ll find that some of those behaviors will be modeled at home, too."

Try the ""racing to get ready"" game.,
Let the other parent try.,
Get a few versions of her favorites.,
Schedule some free time after she gets dressed.",How to Dress Your Daughter For Morning Kindergarten Class," Your daughter should be able to stay warm or cool, both in the morning and the afternoon.


If the temperature is cool or moderate, dress her in layers. She can wear a sweater in the morning and put it in her backpack in the afternoon.;
, Her favorite shirt is in the laundry – don't panic. What is today's topic? Does she want animals? The color purple? Maybe she wants a red ribbon like her friend Lisa?


Try letting her pick out her outfits. This can foster independence and decision-making.
Don't worry if her outfit doesn't match perfectly. She's a little girl. Basically anything she wears will be adorable.

, Pick out one article of clothing (shirt, skirt, colorful socks) from her closet. Then, set a toy timer and tell her that she has 5 minutes to pick out an outfit that matches the shirt. Teach her about matching colors along the way (white goes with everything, a blue and purple patterned shirt matches a blue skirt) and let her make her own decisions. She may be more enthusiastic to get dressed if she created the outfit.


If you're a stay-at-home parent, you could even let her choose your outfit on some days!

, Ask her if she wants to be your twin today. Choose an outfit that you know looks similar to one of hers, and then show her the similarities.

, Tell her daddy is almost winning, he has his pants on, but she can still beat him, all she needs is to put on her clothes fast.

, If Daddy is ready and she is still in her pajamas, don't despair. Sometimes the mom can succeed.

, If sometimes she just has to have her skeleton shirt, buy several identical skeleton shirts. You can also try buying it in a size up so she can wear a bigger version after she grows a bit.

, If she is being resistant, explain that she can go play with her trucks/watch TV/read picture books with Mommy after she is dressed. If she gets dressed quickly, there will be more time to play. This can motivate her to get moving.


This only works if you start early enough. Give her plenty of time, so that free time can be her reward for moving quickly.

Create a play zone in your home.,
Use storage bins.,
Make the bins easy to reach and open.,
Encourage your child to clean up the toys after use.",How to Deal with Too Many Toys After the Holidays1," To keep all your child’s new toys organized, make a play zone or area in your home. This could be in your child’s room, in the living room, or in the den in your home. Use a carpet to note where the play zone ends and store your child’s toys in the play zone. Tell your child that they need to keep toys in the play zone so your house does not become cluttered with all their new toys.You can also use other physical markers like a couch or other furniture to note the play zone. Encourage your child to stay in the play zone with their toys during playtime. Instruct them that other activities like eating or sleeping are done outside the play zone.;
, Keep the new toys organized by using storage bins. Clear plastic storage bins that are deep and narrow are good for storing toys. The clear plastic can make it easy for your child to see the toys in the bin. Soft bins made of fabric or woven material are also good for smaller children, especially if they cannot lift heavy bins on their own.Label the bins so they are organized and it is clear what is inside them. For example, you may have a label that says “Trucks” for toy trucks or a label that says “Plush toys” for stuffed toys.
Keep smaller toys in small bins and larger toys in large bins. Do not fill the bins too high with toys so it is easy for your child to take toys in and out.

, Keep the bins in a spot in the play zone that is easy for your child to access, such as on the floor or on a low shelf. Leave the tops off the bins so your child can reach inside them easily. You may have separate bins in another room for toys that your child does not use or for old toys so their area is not cluttered with bins.You may also rotate out certain bins for certain toys in the play zone. Do this if you need to make space for new toys and do not want the area to become messy or cluttered.

, Get your child in the habit of participating in the clean up of the toys once playtime is over. Say to your child, “Time to clean up,” and encourage your child to pick up toys on the ground and put them in the correct bins. Pull out the bins so it is easy for your child to place toys in the bins and clean up their area.Doing this can also help your child learn the importance of cleaning up after themselves. They may come to appreciate having less toys in the future, especially if they have to clean them all up when they’re done.

Ration the toys.,
Rotate the toys.,
Encourage your kids to share toys.",How to Deal with Too Many Toys After the Holidays2," Control how many toys your child has access to at a time so your home is not overrun with toys. Ask your child to pick four favorite toys and then put the rest of the toys in a separate area, such as a closet, the garage, or the basement. Tell your child they can have access to the other gifts later. You may need to do this sneakily if your child is very young and does not understand the concept of rationing their toys.You can also try putting away presents that have just been unwrapped by their child for later, or leaving out only a few of their new toys instead of all of them. This way, your child can appreciate their new toys a little at a time.

, Another option is to rotate the toys so your child has access to a few toys at a time and gets to play with new toys on a regular basis. You may rotate their toys once a week or once a month. Set aside a certain amount of toys for play every week and keep the rest in storage. Then, change out the toys the following week. This way, your home is not overrun with toys and you can control how many toys your child has access to at once.If your child gets attached to a certain toy, allow them to keep playing with the same toy and rotate the other toys out. Try to keep it to only one favorite toy at a time. Otherwise, you may end up having too many “favorite” toys out at once.

, To cut down on the number of toys in your home, encourage your kids to share their toys with each other. Having your kids share toys will mean there are less toys out at one time and they learn how to play together. Tell your kids that they need to share certain toys, especially new toys, and enjoy the toys together or one at a time.


For example, you may tell your kids, ""Let's share this new toy and play with it together"" or ""Don't fight over the toy, let's share instead.""
Over time, you may need to give away toys that have been shared by your kids. Shared toys tend to get more worn out than other toys. When the time comes, switch out the toy with a new toy or a toy your kids already play with. Then, you can give the old toy away.

Help your kids get used to giving away toys.,
Donate the toys to charity.,
Give the toys away to friends or family with children.,
Have a family or friend keep some of the toys.,
Do a monthly purge of the toys.",How to Deal with Too Many Toys After the Holidays3," To reduce the number of toys in your home, get your kids used to giving away toys they no longer play with or use. One option is to allow your kids to have only a certain number of toys in their play zone at once. Tell your kids they are only allowed to have a certain number of toys and that they have to let go of any toys if they go over this number.You can also encourage your kids to make yes/no piles for their toys where they decide to keep or give away toys. Ask your child, ""Do you play with this toy every week?"" or ""Would I keep this toy in my room and play with it?"" If their answer is ""no"", the toy might need to go in the ""no"" pile to then be given away.
Create a “maybe” box for toys if your child finds it hard to make a decision. Tell your child to put any toys they are tired of or do not play with often in the box to maybe give away. Then, you can look over the toys at the end of the month with them and decide if any of them can be donated or given away.

, If there are too many toys in your house after the holidays, consider donating some of the toys to charity. Go through your child’s old toys and give away any toys they do not play with any more. Look through their new toys and identify any toys that are not age appropriate or outdated. You can also give away toys that you have more than one of to cut down on the amount of toys your child has access to.Check local charities or organizations in your area that take children’s toys. You can also donate the toys to your local Goodwill or Salvation Army.

, You can also give away some of the toys to friends or family who have children. Offer the toys to them, particularly toys that are age appropriate for their kids. If you have a friend who does not have many toys for their children, you may offer some of the toys to them.Suggest that your child assist you in giving away the toys to others who are less fortunate or who do not have access to toys. This can help to teach them the value of being generous and letting go of material things.

, Another option is to keep some of the toys at a close family member’s home, such as the home of your kid’s grandparents. This way, your kids can play with the toys when they are at their grandparent’s home. Or you may store some of the toys at the home of a caretaker nearby so your child can play with the toys when they are being baby sat., To keep the amount of toys in your home under control, do a monthly purge of your child’s toys. Go through their toys every month and identify any toys that do not get much use. Give them away so they are not taking up space. Have your child help you with the purge so they learn how to let go of toys they no longer use.Plan ahead and do a major purge of your kid’s toys before the holiday season. This way, when your child gets new toys during the holidays, there is space for them in your home.

Leave your child out of it.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Brags Too Much About Her Kids1," When your friend starts to irritate you with their incessant bragging, remember why you’re friends in the first place. Inside your friend you’ve seen a great person who’s deserved your time and attention, so don’t abandon them just because they’ve developed a nasty bragging habit.


Look at old photos of you two together.
Send them a text about a shared joke or an old story.
Invite them out to a place you two have enjoyed in the past.
Think about the times that your friend has been there for you in the past.;
, If your friend starts a brag, cut into the conversation before they get bogged down in talking about how great their kid is.


As soon as your friend brings up her child, say something like, “She’s doing so well! Have you tried that pizza place yet?”
Avoid a topic that connects back to the child. For example, don’t say, “I can’t believe it’s only three weeks until Christmas/summer!”

, When your friend brags about their child’s accomplishment, acknowledge what they’ve said but don’t elaborate.Acknowledging their comments will help them realize you do care, even if you don’t want them to keep talking about it.


Say something like “I always knew she was going to be a star!” or “He’s been kicking that soccer ball since he was born!”
Keep it simple. The goal is to end the bragging, so saying too much is counterproductive.

, Steer the conversation to a topic you both enjoy. While it may take time to be fully effective, over time your friend should get the message.Try planning a few alternative subjects in advance so you’re prepared to respond to different types of brags. For example, when your friend brags about their child making the all star little league team, you could say “Did you see that viral video of the kiss cam?”
Stay upbeat. Your positivity will keep your friend from feeling like you don’t care about their child. The issue is the bragging, not the child.
Shift the conversation to the news or a popular TV show that both of you enjoy. You could say, “That reminds me! Have you watched the latest episode of Big Bang Theory?
Avoid pivoting to a topic that makes you look good or that your friend isn’t interested in.

, When your friend brags about their child’s accomplishment, ask them how their child achieved it. When you ask for advice, it makes people think more highly of you and shows them you’re open to what they have to teach you.This both validates your friend whose child is doing well and closes down exaggerations.


When your friend brags that their child kicked the winning goal, ask, “What are you doing to coach her?” Your friend may have great tips to offer, or they may duck the question and change the subject on their own.
Listen to your friend’s answer.
Don’t give up on your friend if they respond with more exaggerations, but do try a different tactic.

, If you have a child, avoid the urge to respond with bragging of your own. Not only does this perpetuate the cycle, but it also sends the message to your friend that you feel that your child is more important than theirs."

Choose a good time to talk.,
Set a friend date.,
Keep a clear head.,
Limit the conversation to how you feel.,
Don’t bring other friends into it.,
Consider your words.,
Listen to your friend.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Brags Too Much About Her Kids2," Once you’re ready to talk to your friend about how their bragging is affecting your relationship, you’ll need to choose the best time to talk. Be mindful that your friend probably won’t like being told that they brag too much.Pick a time that works for your friend. Be considerate of their schedule so that they’ll realize that you value them.
Make sure that you have enough time to talk it out. For example, avoid inviting your friend out for a quick drink at happy hour to discuss the bragging.

, When you’re ready to talk to your friend, make plans to meet them in a neutral location, such as a favorite restaurant that you both enjoy.Avoid talking to them at a place that is normally child-centered, such as a little league game.


Have the conversation when it’s adult’s only so that your friend doesn’t have to choose between your conversation and caring for their child.
Let them know that you need to talk to them. Say, “Hey, I’ve been feeling some distance between us lately, and I’d really like to talk about it.”Assure your friend that you care about his/her child. You could say, “Brennan is such a great kid! His talent speaks for itself.”
Pick a location that you both like, preferably one where you’ve spent many great moments of your friendship.

, While you may want to loosen up with a drink before talking to your friend, resist the urge. You don’t want to say something you regret in the heat of the moment, so stay away from the drinks until you’ve finished discussing your concerns about the bragging.

, Focus solely on how your friend’s bragging is affecting your relationship.


Tell your friend how you feel using “I” statements. You could say, “I feel like your bragging takes away from our time together.”Avoid saying things like, “All you talk about is your kids!” or “You never listen to what’s going on in my life.” While you may feel this way, your friend will tune out your concerns.

, The conversation involves just the two of you, so don’t try to speak for other friends, even if they’ve made comments about the bragging to you in the past.


Avoid statements like, “Everyone says that you brag too much.” This will just put your friend on the defensive.
Don’t gang up on your friend. Only talk to your friend one-on-one.

, Since the goal is to continue being friends, make sure that you don’t say something that will cause more damage to the relationship.Don’t tell your friend that you find them annoying, even if that is sometimes true.
Don’t accuse your friend of bragging to cover up their own insecurities. Even if you are right, this will only cause more hurt, and it’s not your place to diagnose your friends.

, After you've told your friend how you feel about their bragging, listen to what they have to say about the situation. Be open to how they feel.Ask your friend how they feel. Say, ""I really want us to stay close. How are you feeling right now?"" Even if they are upset with you, knowing how they feel will help you move forward.
Realize that they may bring up an issue they've had with your behavior.

Know that bragging brings pleasure.,
Realize your friend may be self-conscious.,
Consider your friend’s personal struggles.,
Observe your own behavior.,
Accept that bragging is sometimes justified.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Brags Too Much About Her Kids3," Bragging stimulates the same part of the brain as eating and having sex, so it’s hard to resist the urge to share. Bragging feels so good that your friend just can’t resist the urge.When your friend starts to brag, try to engage them in another pleasurable activity that you both enjoy, such as sharing popcorn at the movies or cooking a delicious meal together.
If it feels like your friend’s bragging is putting down your child, remind yourself that they’re not even thinking about your kids because they’re focused on their kids., Modern parenting causes people to feel as though raising their child is a project, so they feel like they need to show their progress by telling people of their child’s accomplishments.Your friend’s bragging may stem from this need to have you approve of the hard work that they’re putting into raising their child.


Recognize your friend’s hard work as a parent, and then shift the subject by suggesting that they’ve earned a break. You could say something like, “I saw that Katie won the talent show last Friday. You must have spent hours helping her rehearse that dance. You’ve certainly earned our girls’ night out tonight.”
Steer clear of topics that trigger your friend’s insecurities. For example, if you know that your friend feels bad about allowing her toddler to eat dinosaur shaped nuggets, don’t bring up the juice cleanse you’re starting because it will remind your friend of her parenting worries, causing an urge to brag., Some people focus on their child’s achievements to deal with their own feelings of inadequacy, sadness, or disappointment. A parent who is struggling to find success in their own right may find it easier to live through their child’s achievements.Your friend may feel like their career is going nowhere. If your friend unhappy in their job, they may project any job dissatisfaction onto hopes for the child, hyper focusing instead on accomplishments such as scoring a goal at a soccer game or getting an “A” on a paper.
Your friend may be living through their child’s feats. Was your friend the high school football star who never got to make it to the pros? Or did your friend originally want to go to medical school but didn’t pass the MCATs? When some people fail, they turn their efforts toward making their children into a success so that they can take part in that accomplishment., Could your behavior be contributing to your friend’s compulsion to brag about his or her kids? People love to talk about themselves, even if there is an incentive to talk about others.It’s possible that you’re unconsciously bragging, too.


Think about what you’re saying to your friend. Listen for things like, “I’m so excited about this new project at work!”
Do you like to talk about your own kids? If you discuss your kids, then expect your friend to discuss theirs.
If you don’t have kids, ask yourself if you’re talking too much about your child-free life. It’s possible that you are putting your friend on the defensive., When a child truly does accomplish something important or display genuine talent, celebrate alongside your friend. We should want to see our friends and their children be successful, so congratulate your friend when they truly have a reason to brag."
"
Pay for someone.,
Give small gifts to strangers.,
Help your neighbor.,
Thank those who provide service to us.",How to Do Random Acts of Kindness with Your Kids1," Having someone else surprise you by footing the bill is one of the best ways to get the warm and fuzzies. When you’re the bill payer, you feel just as good, too. When your child is with you, pay for someone in the drive through behind you, cover the fees for the car in back of you at the toll booth or parking garage, or offer to pay for a family’s meal the next time you are at a restaurant. Doing this shows your child that being generous is a good thing.


Have your child get in on the action by encouraging them to save their allowance to cover the waiter’s tip the next time you are out to eat. They will likely feel proud of themselves for earning the money, and then being able to give it to someone else.;
, Try showing up at the playground that your child frequents with a box of small items for your child to give out, such as bubbles or bouncy balls. Then, you could allow your child to give out the presents to other children who are playing at the playground. You might just want to check with their parents first by saying something like, “My daughter wanted to do something nice for all the kids she enjoys playing with at this park. Would it be okay if she gives your son a bouncy ball?”


Another option is to just leave uplifting post-it notes somewhere that a stranger will see them, such as on a mirror in a public restroom. The notes could say things like, “Have a nice day!” or “You are awesome!” Have your kids make the notes and then post them when you are out together.

, Surprise your neighbor by helping them out with their chores. Take their garbage cans from the curb to the house on trash day. You can also rake their leaves or cut their grass to help them out. Weeding the garden and planting pretty flowers, or washing their car for them is not only kind, but particularly helpful, especially when your neighbor is a senior.


If your neighbors are elderly and require help, offer to provide assistance whenever you can. Have your children take out the trash, or come by and read to the neighbor. They can also walk their dogs and bring them dinner once a week. Even if your child is young, coloring or watching TV with the neighbor is often a huge boost to their morale., Say “hi” to a police officer and thank them for being on duty for us. Having your child talk to an officer will not only brighten that officer’s day, but will also teach your kids to be comfortable going up to a cop if they ever need help. Thanking a military member and offering to buy lunch is also a great act of kindness that can go a long way.Make sure to encourage your child to thank all the people who provide services to you and your family. For example, you can say “hello” and “thank you” to the barista who makes your morning coffee, or thank the Uber or taxi driver who gives you and your child a ride to the museum.

Write thank you notes.,
Complete a sibling’s chore.,
Leave a dinner basket.",How to Do Random Acts of Kindness with Your Kids2," It’s common to forget to tell those we spend the most time with how much we appreciate them. An easy way to do this is to write a thank you note. Have your children write their grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, or parent a note that lets them know just how much they mean to them.


For instance, in the note, the child could write, “I just wanted to thank you for being a part of my life. You do so much for me and are a great influence. I love you and appreciate all that you do.”, If you’re looking for a simple random act of kindness that your child can perform and will also encourage your kids to get along, this is the one for you. Talk to one of your children about perform a sibling’s chore as a surprise. This is a win-win for all involved, as it helps to keep your home in order, may promote peace among your children, and makes both kids feel good., After a hard day at work or home, being treated to dinner is such a special treat. If you aren’t able to make the meal yourself or have it delivered, simply place all of the ingredients in a basket and leave it on your loved one’s doorstep, with a recipe included. Having most of the work done and simply having to put the ingredients together is a major help, especially to grandparents or relatives with young children.


Have your child place the ingredients in the basket, and then draw a picture or leave a note for the recipient. This child-friendly task not only adds a special gift for the loved one, but gets your child involved."
"
Create a ""random bucket."",
Donate to a charity or organization.,
Visit a retirement home.,
Volunteer at a local non-profit organization.",How to Do Random Acts of Kindness with Your Kids3," Sometimes, doing good for others can be hard to do in the spur of the moment. You can create a bucket of ideas to draw from whenever you and your children want to spread joy and positivity.


This bucket might include a range of options such as donating to specific charities, offering a cash gift to a church or hospital, offering free services to families in need such as housecleaning or babysitting, or reading a book to children at the local library.

, Go through your child’s old books and toys and take out any that they don’t use anymore. Donate these items to a local children’s hospital or a book or toy drive. Also, donate any pet supplies you don’t use anymore to a shelter, or put money into a Salvation Army bucket.


Have your child choose the items and drop them off with you. Having them involved can help them feel a sense of pride about what they are doing. They can also see where the items are going and how they can help, which may make parting with the donations easier, if they find it difficult., Those who live in retirement homes or communities are often lonely, especially around the holidays. Brighten up someone’s day by taking your child to visit with them. The simple act of having a conversation with a child is enough to elevate a senior’s mood and make the last years of their life more pleasant when it is done often.


Call the retirement home you plan to visit and ask if they accept visitors, as some have strict rules regarding who comes into their facilities. You may also be able to volunteer by reading a book, helping to deliver meals, or just stopping through and saying hi on a regular basis., Volunteering shows your kids that doing things for others, even when you aren’t getting paid for doing so, is extremely rewarding. Ask your child what they would be interested in, whether it’s helping to build homes, working at a soup kitchen, or helping to take care of pets at an animal shelter. Performing these acts of kindness that are related to something your child is interested in will make the experience that much more enjoyable.


Call the charity you are interested in about the age requirements for volunteers. Some non-profits have age restrictions on their volunteers, and some only seek the help of adults. Calling ahead of time can prevent your child from feeling disappointed if they are excited about volunteering and then learn they can’t."

Make water available at all times.,
Change habits gradually.,
Limit other options.,
Explain the change.,
Set a good example.,
Get them involved.,
Keep track with them.,
Offer rewards.,
Play games.",How to Encourage Kids to Drink More Water," It’s simple but true: if you always have cool, refreshing water to offer consistently, your kids will drink more of it. Pack a chilled bottle whenever you go out, and keep a favorite cup filled and ready to go in the fridge at home. Ask them regularly to take a few sips, even if they claim not to be thirsty. Odds are, once they take a sip, they’ll take a drink.The perceived freshness and flavor of the water can matter, though. Schools usually have lots of water fountains, but many kids refuse to drink from them because the fountains are deemed “gross” or the water “tastes yucky.” Schools that replace fountains with “drinking stations” for refillable bottles tend to see an increase in student hydration.If your home tap water has “off” flavors or odors, consider a filtration system. And keep the offered water cold — it is always more appealing that way.;
, Going “cold turkey” by pitching all your soda and juice and stocking your fridge with just water and milk may work for some families, but it is likely to cause a backlash for most. Gradually increasing the amount of water consumed while gradually decreasing the consumption of sugary beverages usually works best in changing drinking behaviors without a major upheaval.Require your child to drink a bit of water before he or she can have soda, juice, etc. Over time, this will make it easier to switch to just drinking the water.
Dilute juices and other drinks with increasing amounts of water. Eventually, you can offer just slightly-flavored water — with lemon or lime wedges, for instance — if necessary. Transform fruits into something meant to be eaten, not drunk as juice., When your kid is thirsty after playtime, and the options include water, milk, and … water, he or she is likely to drink water. Slowly but surely eliminating other drink options will help make water the automatic choice for meals and when thirsty. Of course, this probably means everyone in the family (including you) has to buy into these limited drink options. This is a good thing, though, because drinking water is just as good for you as it is for your kids.If ditching soda and other drinks completely is too much to ask for your family, you can try setting an allowance of one soda per week, or making it an occasional “out of the house” only treat.
The same principle holds true in schools and other settings as well: when there are fewer drink options other than water, kids will drink more water., You may assume that your kids won’t understand or care why they are being prompted to drink more water, but give them a chance. Kids are by nature curious, and are probably more likely to accept (or at least tolerate) a change if you can give them a better reason than “because I said so.”Give your kid the basic information in a manner appropriate to his or her age. Explain that our bodies are mostly water, require a consistent supply of water to function properly, and that the best way to hydrate the body is to consume plain water. Show them nutritional guides on sodas, juices, etc., listing the number of calories and sugars in those drinks, and discuss the problems with overconsuming these. Tell that them that drinking lots of water is one of the easiest and best ways to look and feel alert, energetic, and healthy., Convincing your kids to drink more water is not typically a “do as I say, not as I do” situation. They learn by watching you, and are more likely to embrace the change if they see you doing the same — especially once you have explained how important it is to make water the beverage of choice.How to Drink More Water Every Day offers some useful tips.

, Don’t make the switch to water into a top-down directive, as if it is some sort of punishment. Help your kids feel like they are actively involved in the process, and give them the opportunity to make (guided) choices and do things for themselves. If you can make drinking more water seem like something a “big kid” or “grown up” would choose to do, you may be well on your way to achieving your goal.Remind them when it’s time for a drink, but let them go to the fridge or fill up their cups — as far as spills go, water is an easy clean-up!
Let them pick out a special cup just for them — with princesses, trucks, a favorite sports team logo, etc. — on the condition that it can only be filled with water.

, From height charts to merit badge collections, growing kids like to be able to keep track of their progress. Try keeping a weekly chart on the fridge and check off each time your child finishes off a glass of water. Use colorful stickers or markers if that helps. Compare weekly progress and set goals to beat.If you have multiple kids in the house, you may want to keep color-coded water bottles in the fridge, to make it easier for you (and them) to keep track of their daily progress. Kids being as they are, things will probably turn into a (literally) healthy competition., If you’ve gotten your kids involved in the process, and found ways to track their progress, offering rewards as an incentive is practically the natural next step. If you’re charting the progress of multiple kids, for instance, even a small weekly prize for the “winner” can provide ample motivation, especially once their competitive juices are flowing.Offering a soda as a reward may seem counterintuitive or like your best bet, depending upon your perspective and circumstances. Ideally, make the reward a healthy one, like a trip to the local pool or skating rink, or a half-hour of family play-time in the yard where the winner gets to pick the games.

, Inadequate water consumption is serious business, but that doesn’t mean getting kids to drink more water needs to be. You may not naturally associate “drinking water” with “fun,” but kids can turn practically anything into a game, especially with your help.


For instance, give each kid a long, windy, silly straw and see who can suck up their cup of water first.Or, put a piece of a mystery fruit or vegetable (watermelon, cucumber, peach, etc.) in an opaque cup of water and let the kid guess the contents based on taste. Even better, have the child eat the mystery fruit or veggie after finishing off the water.For that matter, who says you can’t draw from your college experience (or ones you’ve seen on TV) and adapt a game of “beer pong”? Replace beer with water and chugging with sipping, and you’ll have yourself a family-friendly game of “water pong.”

Know the right moment.,
Consider age appropriateness.,
Be supportive.,
Provide them with education material.,
Provide additional resources.,
Let them know they can always talk to you.",How to Discuss Teen Pregnancy With Kids1," Find an agreeable space for both you and your children. This can be a neutral zone such as a living room or kitchen. Find a snug place to sit. You both want to be as relaxed as possible before talking about a topic that can sometimes be viewed as controversial, taboo, or awkward.;
, Your children look at you as an authority figure. When you first broach the subject, they may feel like they have done something wrong.They may be scared. Avoid this problem by reassuring them that you just want to talk and provide information. You may want to start off by saying something like:


”Hey there do you have a minute or two to talk? You’ve been doing great lately on . I wanted to talk to you about some health stuff.”

, It is not a good idea to just randomly start talking about sex.Instead, find an appropriate moment to sit down with your children and talk to them. This could be when you are alone, or both have open free time to have a serious chat.

, If your child is middle-school aged, your conversation may be about safe sex or sexual health. If you're speaking to younger children, such as grade-school, your discussion may be more of a general health talk. If you're speaking to an older child, you may want to give specific details on sex such as prophylactic use.


You have to be the judge on when it is the right time to talk to your children. You might notice they are starting to have interests in a relationship with another person. You might want to talk to them before they hit puberty. Pick the type of conversation you want to have based on your child's needs, interests, and age.

, You want to provide a sympathetic and knowledgeable ear to your children. You should show support for the questions that they have or what their concerns may be.By doing this, your children may feel more comfortable coming to you for future problems. Perhaps use some of these phrases:


”And know you can always come to me with questions or concerns. You will not get in trouble for asking questions. I just want you to be healthy.”
”Your decisions about your sexuality are your own. I love you and support you no matter what.”
”Your safety and health are really important to me. I would appreciate it if you came to me with any concerns you may have.”

, Children may feel awkward asking you direct questions. Provide materials like brochures from a doctor’s office to give them something to read and think about when you two are finished.

, There are many reputable resources available for teenagers who want to learn more about teenage pregnancies or to support pregnant teenagers. National institutions, such as the Center for Disease Control (CDC), provide easy-to-read guides for both parents and kids., Don’t let this conversation be forgotten. If you are supportive and listen to your children, it may foster a healthier relationship. Open communication between parent and child can be very beneficial. Say things like:


”I am here for you no matter what.”
”Know that you can always come to me with questions.”
”I love you and want to help as much as possible.”

Prepare handouts or other material.",How to Discuss Teen Pregnancy With Kids2," Before you speak to children about teen pregnancy, make sure you have the correct facts.You want to give the most accurate and sincere information. Look up statistics, scenarios, and graphics before you give your speech.


Helpful resources include the Center for Disease Control as well as Planned Parenthood. They have great resources like brochures, statistics, and visuals to help with education.Planned Parenthood even has a website that is directed toward teenagers. Teens can take health quizzes and look up answers to frequently asked questions, You want to have a captive audience that will believe what you have to say. Do not make up facts to scare them. This may result in them not listening to authority figures in the future. Being honest sets a good example for future conversations.

, Talking about sex may be an awkward conversation, but still expect question. Look up frequently asked questions about teenage pregnancy to prepare., Once you have gathered the facts, write out what you want to say and practice it. It will make you more confident and more comfortable with the topic.

, Give kids or teenagers the option to take material home with them. If they feel uncomfortable listening to an adult talk about this information, they might read information on their own. Help control what information you want them to see by providing your own.


Statistics - You can provide statistics about teen pregnancy rates in your country. You can give hard facts and numbersGraphs or other visuals - Use the data you have collected and present it in an image. This can make quite a statement, especially if it uses real-life facts and figures.
Demonstrations - If you plan on talking about safe sex with your children, consider demonstrating skills that might help them. You can show your children how to use a condom or other contraceptives.
Scenarios - Find some scenarios about teen pregnancy. Use the concrete examples as a way to explain the effects of teen pregnancy such as high school dropout rates and poverty rates.

If it is a group of younger kids, you may have to present your information differently than if you are presenting it to teenagers. Consider the age group and background of your audience.

, You will want to adapt your message depending on the age of the childrenIf you are speaking to a teenager, you may want to create a more specific speech about safe-sex. If you are speaking to children, your message may focus more on reproductive changes or health.

, Your children may have already been exposed to reproductive health classes or speeches at their school. Ask your children or call the school to find out what has already been covered.


Ask questions on what reproductive topics the school has taught or intends to teach.
Ask if school speaks on abstinence education only.
Ask if they have already-prepared material.

Track how often they resist school.,
Assess how strongly they resist.,
Evaluate how it impacts their life.,
Identify normal avoidance.,
Recognize school refusal.",How to Deal with a Child Not Wanting to Go to School1," There are some times that it’s common for students not to want to go to school. They may feel that something happening outside of school is more appealing. Or, they may have a specific, but temporary, reason for not wanting to go. In other situations, it seems that there’s no specific reason the child doesn't want to go to school. This can help you determine whether the child is avoiding school like all children do every now and then or if they are showing signs of school refusal.For example, think about whether they are resisting school immediately before or after a school break. They may simply be either eager for the break to start or reluctant for it to end.
If you're their parent, you can contact their teacher in order to determine if they're resisting school because they have upcoming tests or projects are due.
Try to find out if the child recently had an argument with a friend or partner. Children, especially adolescents, may resist school for a short time in situations like that.
Ask yourself if they resist going to school all of the time. For example, does it seem that the child resists going to school every day regardless of what’s going on?;
, Some children throw a tantrum every morning while getting ready for school, but they get ready, and they do go. On the other hand, some children fight tooth and nail all the way to their desk and may even attempt to leave school early. At the extreme, some children even threaten self-harm. Determining how strongly the child resists can help you determine whether this is normal avoidance or school refusal.Try rating the child’s resistance on a scale of 1 – 5, with 1 being them just saying they don't want to go and 5 being a full out tantrum.
Think about the extremity of the things they say. For instance, are they just saying they don't want to go to school or are they threatening extreme action if you make them go?

, This can help you determine how serious the situation is, as well as how you should handle it. Even though some kids may quietly refuse to go to school, their refusal may be unwavering to the point that they are continually tardy or absent. Other children may resist but still go to school and have little affect on their life.Look at whether the child is frequently missing school or late to school. This is a definite sign that there's a problem.
Review the child’s grades. Continual tardiness and absences, as well as not participating when they are there, cause the child to suffer academically.
Ask yourself if the child is doing things that threaten their health or safety in order to avoid school. For example, have they made themselves vomit or caused themselves other harm in order to stay home?

, Every now and then every child resists going to school. This can be frustrating when it happens, but it’s normal. Understanding whether you're dealing with normal avoidance or school refusal will help you determine the best course of action for addressing the situation. Consider the frequency, intensity, and impact of their resistance in order to identify normal avoidance.


Normal avoidance causes little to no impact on the child’s life. For example, look for signs that they're maintaining their grades and getting to school on time.
When kids are normally resisting school they may pout, cry, verbally refuse, or even throw a tantrum, but, in the end, they still get ready, make it to school, and often end up having a good day.
Remember that resisting school every day can still be considered normal if the child regularly goes to school on time, stays the whole day, and is generally behaving as they typically do at home. They just might not be a morning person.

, This is a much more persistent and serious problem than normal school avoidance. When you consider when, how often, and how strong they resist going to school, along with how it impacts their life you’ll have an idea of whether you’re dealing with school refusal or not. You can then decide how best to address it.


Understand that children showing school refusal resist school almost every day and can go to extreme measures in their attempt to stay home.
You can recognize school refusal by the negative impact it has on the child’s life. For example, truancy, frequent tardiness and early dismissals, falling grades, or behavior problems in school.

Look for the warning signs of avoidance.,
Stay positive about the situation.,
Remind them of the consequences of missing school.,
Motivate them with incentives.,
Make staying home boring.,
Be consistent.",How to Deal with a Child Not Wanting to Go to School2," Often children, especially younger ones, will give you warning signs that they're going to try to avoid school. A big part of this will be listening to the hints the child gives that they may try to avoid school. Another part will be paying attention to other clues they give you.


For example, listen for indirect statements like, “School’s going to be boring,” as well as direct statements such as, “I don't want to go to school” that indicate they're going to resist school.
Look for signs like unspecific illnesses that spontaneously occur. For example, if the night before a test, your 4th grader develops a stomachache that they're sure will prevent them from going to school but won't affect them going to the park in the evening.

, Even though the child’s antics may make you want to lose your cool, don’t. Your disposition about the child not wanting to go to school can play a major influence on how the situation goes.Maintaining a positive attitude can help encourage the child to go to school and help you remain calm. It also helps you focus on coming up with strategies to get the child to go to school, rather than reacting to them.


Speak calmly, but firmly, to the child about going to school. You might, for instance, say, “Going to school isn’t negotiable, but we can talk about how to make it a better experience for you.”
Avoid yelling or threatening them. For example, don’t scream, “You better get ready for school, or else!” Instead, remain calm.
Remind yourself that this is a temporary situation that you can and will work through. You might tell yourself, “I don't have to get upset. This is temporary. I can stay calm.”

, While you don’t want the child to experience any serious negative consequences because of their resistance to school, dealing with the natural consequences of missing school can be a valuable lesson.Remind the child about the work they'll have to make up, the fun they may miss out on, and the effect it could have on their grades, attendance record, and other activities.


You might say something like, “Remember, though, that if you miss school, your coach won’t let you attend practice. And, if you don’t attend practice, she won’t let you play in the game.”
Or, you might try, “Since you’ll have make-up work you'll need to do on top of your regular homework, I don't think you'll have time to hang out with your friends tomorrow night.”
Or, you can tell them that they will have additional chores at home, and their TV or game time will be restricted.

, Sometimes it can be helpful to offer the child a small reward for going to school.This isn’t a method you want to use every day, but it can be useful every now and then to help motivate a child to go to school.


For example, if your daughter doesn’t want to attend the first day at her new school, you might offer to buy her a new outfit to help boost her confidence.
Or, for instance, you could prepare a special activity for a toddler that gets upset when their parent drops them off for the first few times.

, Often children want to stay home because they imagine all the fun things they’ll do. One way to deal with a child not wanting to go to school is to make being at home during a school day unappealing.Doing this can encourage the child to go to school because it seems more fun than not going.


Let the child know they'll still have learning to do. For example, you can contact their teacher and get their assignments for the day and have them work on it at home. Or, you can develop your own work for them.
Restrict the use of games, electronic devices, and play time for the day. You can say, “If you aren't well enough for school, you're not well enough to play.”

, This provides structure and routine for children and helps them know when to expect. Especially for younger children, your consistency can give them the reassurance and security they need to go to school without incident.This means being consistent with your insistence that they attend school and not encouraging or allowing them to miss school without a good reason.
It also means being consistent in terms of picking them up on time each day or having arrangements made for when they arrive home.

Provide security to handle separation anxiety.,
Report bullying.,
Seek help if you suspect abuse or neglect.,
Get treatment for substance abuse.,
Be aware of mental health issues.",How to Deal with a Child Not Wanting to Go to School3," This is most often an issue with younger children, but can also be a concern with some older children. They may have fears about being away from you or you coming back. The best thing you can do to deal with a child that doesn’t want to go to school because of separation anxiety is to constantly reassure them and do things to help them feel more secure.Talk with the child about how the day will go. For example, you might tell them, “First, we'll walk to your class so you can have fun learning. I’ll go to work. Then, at 3 o’clock I'll come to your classroom to pick you up.“
If you're a teacher, reassure the child that their parent will return at the end of the day. You might say, “After we have fun together learning, your dad will pick you up.”
If you’re the child’s parent, always be on time for dismissal. If you're going to be late, call the school and let the child know.
Children may exhibit school refusal following a family illness or death. Take stock of any recent upsets or losses in the family.
If needed, consider getting therapy to help the child overcome their anxiety., Bullying has, unfortunately, become an everyday reality for many children. In many cases, children refuse to go to school because they're being bullied and may not have reported it or know how to handle it.If you discover that this is the reason, you should talk to the child about what's going on as well as report it to the appropriate authorities.


Ask the child directly if they're being bullied. You could try, “Is there someone at school or something going on at school that's bothering you?”
Let the child know that you are there to support them. You might say something like, “I know that it can be hard going to school when you’re being bullied. I'm here for you and we'll get through this.”
Talk to the school counselor, principal, and other appropriate authorities about what is happening to the child.

, Refusal to attend school and difficulties at school are sometimes signs of child abuse or child neglect.Look at other areas of the child’s behavior and life to determine if abuse or neglect might be an issue. If you have any concerns about the child’s safety, you should contact authorities immediately.


Review the list of signs and symptoms of child abuse provided by Mayo Clinic at http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/child-abuse/basics/symptoms/con-20033789.
Report your concerns to the school counselor, the child’s pediatrician, or other appropriate authorities.

, Children are abusing drugs and alcohol at earlier ages than ever before. In some instances, a child’s refusal to go to school may be a sign of substance abuse.If you suspect that this is the case, look for other signs that the child may have a substance abuse problem and seek treatment for it immediately.


Review the list of signs and symptoms provided by DrugFree.org at http://www.drugfree.org/resources/is-your-teen-using-signs-and-symptoms-of-substance-abuse/.
Let the child know you're concerned. You can say, “I think you have a substance abuse problem and its interfering with you going to school. I'm concerned and want to help you.”
Talk to the child’s pediatrician about age-appropriate substance abuse services in the area.

, Sometimes issues like depression, anxiety, or other disorders can cause a child to refuse to go to school. Consider the child’s mental health when you plan ways to address their school refusal. In some cases, treating the mental health issues can eliminate their refusal to go to school.If the child has a diagnosed mental illness, check to see how their treatment is going or if there have been changes in treatment. For instance, you might ask their parent, “If you don’t mind me asking, how is treatment going right now?”
If you suspect a mental illness, you should contact their school counselor or pediatrician as soon as possible. For example, if the child is withdrawing, moody, or seems hopeless, in addition to refusing to go to school, it might be a sign of depression and you should seek help.

Practice deep breathing.,
Turn on some soothing music.,
Get some fresh air.,
Perform progressive relaxation together.",How to Deal with Stress when Watching Kids1," Stress causes the “fight or flight” response in your body to kick in. Your heart beats faster, you may have trouble focusing, and your breath becomes shallow. Deep breathing is a great exercise to practice when you’re feeling stressed and overwhelmed. Controlling your breath sends the message to your body that it’s okay to relax. Plus, you can use this technique anywhere, at any time.


An easy way to remember how to do deep breathing is with the 4-7-8 approach. This involves taking a deep breath in through your nose for 4 counts. Hold the breath for 7 counts. Then, exhale the air through your mouth for 8 counts. Repeat until you start to feel more calm.;
, Music is one of the most beloved art forms as there are sounds that can match almost any mood you’re in. Use music to your advantage and turn on some tunes when watching the kids becomes stressful.


There’s no limit to the type of music that you can listen to. Choose some songs that help you feel relaxed and inspired and add them to a playlist.You can even get the kids involved for some fun stress-relief by having a karaoke show. Compile a list of songs to which they may know the words and take turns performing. This will not only relieve tension, but it can also show you have talented they are.

, Sometimes, looking after kids can result in anxiety because you’ve been cooped up inside far too long. Have everyone put on shoes and appropriate outerwear and go on a little field trip. Being in a natural environment can reduce stress and positively benefit both you and the kids’ well-being. The great outdoors lowers heart rate and blood pressure, eases muscle tension, and decreases stress hormones for an all-around better mood.Make it fun by playing a game of pretend. Be a general leading his troops through enemy territory. Or, have a contest to see who can find the most interesting leaves or rocks.

, Whether you are a parent or a caretaker you can achieve calm by doing relaxing exercises by yourself or with the children. Progressive muscle relaxation involves gradually tensing then releasing different muscle groups to help you identify tension and notice what relaxation feels like.


Have everyone sit on the couch or in chairs. Instruct them to take a couple deep breaths: “In through your nose and out through your mouth.” Then, starting with the feet, contract the muscles in your toes and ankles. Hold for a few seconds. Release. Notice what that feels like. Then, move to the next set of muscles: your calves. Continue until you have completed the entire body.You can close off a session of progressive muscle relaxation with some stretching exercises. This can further help loosen tension and give the kids some time to wind down.

Ask for help from friends or family.,
Engage in a hobby—with the kids.,
Get some exercise.,
Cut back on some obligations.",How to Deal with Stress when Watching Kids2," If you’re feeling stressed out from watching your own kids, one solution is to see if a loved one is willing to give you a break. Oftentimes, parents suffer in silence, not knowing that friends or family members are more than happy to pitch in.Reach out to your best pal or sibling for help. You can say, “Oh, Tori, I can’t tell you how beat I am. Since the kids have been out of school, it’s been nonstop. Do you mind taking them for a few hours on Saturday so I can catch my breath?”
If you don’t have loved ones who can help, see if you can hire professional help like a babysitter or get assistance from your children’s schools. Getting them involved in after-school programs or extracurricular activities can give you more “me-time.”

, Getting your children involved in a meaningful activity can help them channel their excess energy into something positive. Do you love to paint, bake, play basketball, or garden? Relieve your stress by doing the things you love most, and have the children participate with you.


Make it exciting by visiting the store—if it’s in your budget—and getting supplies so that the children have kid-friendly tools to work with you. Then, spend an afternoon showing them how to do your passion., Physical activity is one of the most underused anti-anxiety treatments. Moving your body through rhythmic exercise produces chemical in your body called endorphins that calm you down and improve your mood. Try swimming, running, hiking, dancing, or just walking your dog around the neighborhood.Again, this is another practice that can be done solo or as a group. Try a family activity to help the kids tired themselves out and get the advantages of exercise, too. All it takes is about 30 minutes of activity to feel the positive benefits., If you’re dealing with chronic stress and anxiety as a parent, it may be a good idea to examine your to-do list. Parents frequently fill their days doing for others, not realizing that they can’t pour out of an empty cup. Take a close look at your activities calendar and see what tasks can be automated, delegated, or crossed off completely.


For instance, if you spend a great deal of time in the grocery store, can you arrange to order online and pick them up curbside? Can you have your partner or another parent bring your kids home from practice some days of the week? Do you really need to head up all the parent-teacher meetings, or step down and spend that time doing something you love?"
"
Call or text a friend to vent.,
Ask for 5 minutes.,
Have a laugh.,
Schedule calming activities.,
Request time off.",How to Deal with Stress when Watching Kids3," Having an empathetic, listening ear can make all the difference in helping your relieve tension from caring for a couple of rowdy kids. Just giving a friend a call for a quick chat and hearing a friendly voice may help cheer you up.


If you can’t make a phone call, try texting. A simple “I’m feeling overwhelmed” conveys your message and may open you up to receiving encouragement or helpful advice from your pal., If the kids are stressing you out, simply ask for 5 minutes of alone time to regroup. If they are older kids, this might include going outside or for a walk around the neighborhood to collect yourself. For younger kids, you might involve them in an activity and then take 5 to practice deep breathing or listen to some uplifting songs on your phone.


Don’t be afraid to say you need space to retreat. Taking a few intentional breaks while caring for kids can prevent you exploding later., As the saying goes, “Laughter is the best medicine.” Take off your “serious” costume for a moment to release tension. Considering that you’re watching kids, finding humor shouldn’t be too hard. Kids are constantly doing and saying things that can make an adult crack a smile.


If the kids don’t provide any opportunity for laughter, search for funny memes on your phone or watch a silly YouTube video. Doing so will help you ease stress, reduce anger, and relax your whole body., If a third round of pillow fighting or Dungeons & Dragons just might make you scream, find a less noisy task for your charges. Take a break from the boisterous activities in favor of more quiet undertakings like drawing, coloring, playing with Play-Doh . Just a few moments of relative peace can be just what you need to kick stress to the curb.

, If you are being saddled with the kids too often, ask for a break. Whether you’re a paid sitter or a grandparent who’s always on babysitting speed-dial, be willing to speak up when you’re being overworked or taken for granted.You might say, “I enjoy watching the kids, but I could use a weekend off. Do you think that can be arranged?” Or, you can suggest alternating sitters for parents who require lots of help. That way, no one person gets too stressed out from the job.

Be consistent.",How to Stop a Child from Whining," Most children do not whine to annoy or anger you. They may be feeling tired, hungry, stressed, or uncomfortable, or they may just want attention. Stopping to put yourself in your child’s shoes may help you understand the causes of the whining, and then you will be better able to take preventative measures.;
, Fatigue can contribute to a number of undesirable behaviors, including whining. Aim for an appropriate amount of sleep each night, and consider an earlier bedtime if you notice a lot of crankiness and whining. If your child is preschool-aged or younger, make sure he or she gets an afternoon nap; if your child is elementary-school-aged, give him or her a chance to rest and relax after school.


Children’s individual sleep needs vary, but in general, toddlers between one and three years of age need a total of twelve to fourteen hours a day (including naptime). Three to six year olds need ten to twelve hours a day, and seven to twelve year olds still need ten to eleven hours.

, Hunger makes children uncomfortable and cranky, and it tends to trigger bad behaviors like whining. Many children need small, nutritious snacks between meals, so don’t expect your child to last from lunch to dinner with nothing to eat. For best results, offer a combination of protein, whole grains, and produce: a few whole-grain crackers with peanut butter and a banana, for example.

, Children tend to whine when you tell them to do something they do not want to do. Minimize this problem by offering a warning in advance, rather than suddenly springing something unpleasant on your child. Say, “we’ll have to leave the playground in ten minutes” or “you’ll have to get ready for bed after one more story.” When children know what to expect, they are generally better able to adjust.

, Children often struggle to tolerate being bored; they then whine because they want attention and don’t know how to cope with boredom. If you have a whiny child, try to offer plenty of engaging age-appropriate activities. Whenever possible, some of these activities should take place outdoors, where children can burn excess energy more easily.


If you are noticing issues related to boredom, whining, and decreased attention spans, consider eliminating (or at least minimizing) the time your child spends watching television or playing with electronic devices. These activities may occupy your child and prevent whining in the short term, but they may exacerbate the problem in the long term, leaving your child unable to occupy himself without cartoons or video games.

, When children feel ignored, they often whine to get your attention. You may be able to prevent this by spending quality time with your child, even just in small moments, throughout the day. Parents are so busy that doing so can be difficult, but try:


sitting with your child and having a conversation while he or she eats breakfast
stopping for a moment to admire your child’s drawing, block tower, or other creative project
taking a ten-minute break from whatever you are doing to read your child a story
asking your preschooler or elementary school student to tell you all about his or her day at school
setting aside the hour before bedtime for quality family time and a consistent bedtime routine

, Whining often seems to be at its worst when you have to take your child with you on an errand. Children perceive banks, stores, and supermarkets as boring (or, alternatively, as an opportunity to beg for you to buy them things). Avoid whining and other bad behavior by giving your child something to do – he or she can help you find an item on your grocery list, for example.

, When your preventive measures haven’t worked, and your child starts whining, consider trying a more light-hearted approach – especially with younger children. A little fun and silliness can sometimes snap children out of a cranky, whiny mood.

, Toddlers and preschoolers, especially, can sometimes be cajoled into laughing by funny faces. If your young child is whining, and you feel the urge to turn around and scold or yell, try turning around and making a crazy face instead. You may just stop your child in mid-whine and start a fit of laughter.

, Surprise a whining child by turning their behavior around and indulging in some whining yourself. You can even exaggerate for comic effect: “Whyyyyyyyyy are you stiiiiiiiiiiiiilll whiiiiiiining like thaaaaat? I doooooon’t liiiiiiiiike it!” This may serve two separate purposes. First, it may make your child laugh and therefore interrupt the whining cycle. Second, it will let your child know how he or she sounds – younger children may not be fully aware of how annoying and ridiculous whining can sound to others.

, Like imitating your child, recording his or her whining can call attention to how ridiculous it sounds. Use your phone or a tape recorder, and record the whining, then play it back for your child.

, When your child is whining and complaining, speak back in a very soft whisper. Your child will have to stop whining, at least temporarily, to hear what you say, and he or she may start whispering as well. For younger children, this can work as a silly way to interrupt whining and shift the mood.

, Ask your child to repeat his or her request in a different tone or in full sentences. Repeat for dramatic effect: “ooh, I still don’t understand you! I wish I could understand what you are saying! Try again, please! What was that?”

, Once a child reaches elementary school, he or she should usually be able to control objectionable behavior like whining. Explain that you will not allow whining at all, and make it clear that when your child whines, you will not grant his or her requests.

, Make sure your child knows that you will listen to his or her requests and that you like talking to him or her. Just make it clear that discussions need to happen with normal voices, at normal volumes.

, Say, “I know you are upset, but . . .” and explain why you cannot do what your child is requesting. It’s fine to validate your child’s frustration, but don’t give in to an extended discussion when he or she is whining.

, When whining continues, explain that you are not going to listen to it. Send your child to another room until he or she can calm down and speak normally.

, If whining becomes a major problem in your house, let your child know that he or she will get one warning and then a time out for whining. Then stick to your rule. When your child whines, give one clear, firm warning: “You are whining right now. Speak in a normal voice, or you will get a time out.” If the whining continues, enforce the time-out.


A good general rule of thumb, for time outs, is that they should last one minute for each year of your child’s age. In other words, a five year old would stay in time out for five minutes.

, Children should never be rewarded for whining, so whatever the request is, turn it down. Implement time outs or other punishments for continued whining, but otherwise, ignore it. Don’t reward your child’s behavior by giving it undue attention.

, If you get upset, your child will know that he or she can provoke you by whining. Keep your cool.

, Praise your child's efforts to stop whining. Consider celebrating a ""no whining day"" at home, and offer a reward if your child makes it all the way to the end of the day. Make this a fun, light-hearted family event.

, Your child will not stop whining immediately; you’ll need to be firm and consistent, and over time, the behavior will diminish.

Recognize different symptoms that mentally ill children may experience.,
Check up on them regularly.,
Note any drastic changes in behavior or personality, particularly any out-of control behavior.,
Look for psychosomatic symptoms.,
Pay attention to acting out.,
Consider the questions they ask you.,
Do some research on mental illness.,
Consider things that have happened to them.",How to See Signs of Mental Illness in Children," Note only criteria that are interfering with your child's ability to act normally or feel okay. A mentally ill child may feel one or more of the following:


Inability to concentrate
Easily distracted
Difficulty problem-solving and maintaining school performance
Hearing voices or seeing things that are not there (hallucinations)
Persistent disobedience or aggressive behavior
Mood swings
Persistent feelings of sadness and worry
Hyper-energetic
Aches, pains, or sleeping problems that nothing seems to explain
Speaks rapidly and is difficult to interrupt;
, Ask how their day was, and listen closely, asking questions to help you understand better. This will strengthen the bond between you, and let them know that they can confide to you when they have a problem. Mentally ill children may have more bad days, and/or experience more physical symptoms, like headaches and stomachaches.

, Behavior changes may be very different depending on the disorder.


Some mentally ill children become aggressive: fighting frequently, using weapons or expressing a desire to badly hurt others
Others become overly passive: withdrawing from other people, losing interest in their favorite activities, neglecting to make decisions
A child may swing between two extremes. For example, sometimes they may act hyper and giddy, then quickly become crabby and lethargic.
Out-of-control behavior is not necessarily dangerous. For example, if a child has been crying for half an hour straight and nothing can stop her, something is clearly wrong.

, Mentally ill children can exhibit physical symptoms such as...


Headaches
Stomachaches
Soreness/tension
Sleeping trouble or fatigue
Mystery illnesses (e.g. fever and exhaustion) that doctors can't seem to explain

, Children may act out because they don't know how else to express their frustration, or as a cry for help. If a child begins acting out, don't immediately call them naughty and plan the best punishment. Calm them down and then ask why they did what they did.


If they can't provide a good reason regarding why they did something, it was probably due to overwhelming emotions.

, Anxious children may ask the same question over and over again, or ask questions when the answer is obvious to them. This is because their brain is full of irrational thoughts that they are trying to silence.


For example: ""Mom comes home soon, right?"" (five minutes later) ""Mom comes home soon?"" The child may be experiencing an intense fear that their mom will die in an accident.
Usually it's best to reassure them, even if you say things that aren't completely certain. (""Yes, you'll do fine at your new school."") Rationally, they know that it's impossible to predict the future—they're just looking for reassurance that it won't be a disaster.

, Look up your child's symptoms, and find a few different disorders that could be causing them.


Rid yourself of the myth that mentally ill people are violent.The media often spreads untrue stereotypes about this, and it says nothing about your child.Recognize that it may not necessarily be a mental illness, but another disability, such as autism,or the onset of an illness that is changing their behavior.

, Sometimes, mental illness appears as a result of experiencing psychological trauma.


Severe emotional, physical, or sexual abuse
Witnessing abuse
Disasters such as earthquakes or floods
Compliance-based therapies such as ABAAn important early loss, such at the loss of a parent or guardian
Severe illness or injury
A situation in which they feared for their life (or someone else's)

Discuss feelings with your child.,
Give your child boundaries.,
Provide additional coping strategies.,
Recognize consistent triggers.,
Eliminate as many obstacles as possible.",How to Stop Your Child from Being Aggressive1," As your child grows, they will experience a range of changing feelings. Some stages, like being a toddler or teenager, will bring extreme changes to your child’s emotions. If your child is young, talk to them about the different feelings that they may experience. As your child becomes familiar with their emotions, ask them to identify how they are feeling to help them practice processing their emotions. Helping your child to understand their feelings will help them express them in a healthy way.You can find flashcards and story books to help your child better understand feelings.
You could say something like, “I know that you are feeling upset, but this is totally normal. Everyone gets frustrated sometimes.”;
, Children need limits to guide their behavior. As a parent, you have to set the limits for what behavior is acceptable and what is not. Once a boundary is set, it must always be consistent. If you allow your child to get by with something, they will think that the behavior is acceptable.For example, if you are teaching your child that they cannot hit another person, this has to be true for every person. You should not punish them for hitting a sibling, but condone them hitting an uncle.

, Aggressive behaviors like hitting and yelling are ways that children express and cope with their emotions. Giving your child healthy ways to express themselves and work out their emotions will let them rely less on aggressive behavior. Teach them coping skills such as talking about their feelings, taking a moment to themselves, or moving on to a new activity.For example, you could teach your child to stop and count to ten when they feel upset. This will give them time to process their feelings before reacting.
Meditation and mindfulness help children improve their attention and regulate their emotions. Those skills continue into adulthood., Some children react aggressively when they are hungry or sleepy. If you notice a pattern to your child’s aggression, keep track of it. This can help you identify the things that frustrate your child and cause aggression.Meet with your child’s teachers, daycare providers, and other caretakers to discuss their behavior and contributing factors so that you can construct an accurate picture about what is happening with your child. Some kids behave differently at home than they do in other situations, such as in school or daycare.
Hunger, tiredness, or being uncomfortable can all be triggers that contribute to lashing out aggressively.

, Once you identify your child’s triggers, you can start removing or controlling them. The more of these triggers that you address, the more you can help your child cope with their emotions. Just keep in mind that you will not be able to remove all triggers all the time.For example, if your child is aggressive when they are hungry, you could make it a point to pack snacks whenever you go somewhere.
Since lack of sleep is a major contributor for aggression in children, teach your child good sleep habits using a bedtime ritual.
If your child is aggressive because they are sleepy, make time for a nap during the day; however, remember that naps do not replace a full-night’s sleep.

Avoid escalation.,
Discuss the behavior.,
Remove your child from the situation.,
Encourage your child to make amends.",How to Stop Your Child from Being Aggressive2," You might have the urge to try to frighten aggressive behavior out of your child. While many people do subscribe to this type of parenting, it generally makes the situation worse. When you talk to your child, sit down or get at eye level. Keep a calm voice.. Also, make sure that any physical contact is used as a way to connect empathetically to your child and not as a punishment.If you yell at, or hit, your child when they have upset you, you will be reinforcing aggression as a way to handle emotions.

, When your child is behaving aggressively, sometimes you only need to point it out to end the aggression. Tell your child that their actions are hurtful to others around them, and instruct them on how to behave appropriately by redirecting them to the coping skills that you’ve taught them. To keep their attention, maintain eye contact and keep a hand on their shoulder or hold their hand.Ask your child how they could better handle the situation in the future. Ask, “Next time you feel frustrated, what should you do?”

, If your de-escalation attempts fail, your child may be overwhelmed. Take them away from the current environment (including the people around them) to let them reset. This can be done by moving into a hallway or even making a brief trip to the restroom.If you are unable to remove your child from the situation immediately (for example, during a funeral service), you can distract them from the situation with a toy or snack.

, When you child has acted aggressively, they should apologize to the other person or people involved. Depending on what happened, they may need to take other steps to repair the relationship, such as replacing a toy they broke. By addressing the situation, your child will develop their conscience and forethought, both of which are important for long-term relationships and emotional health.

"
"
Avoid aggressive tendencies.,
Show your child healthy interactions.,
Address your child in a respectful way.",How to Stop Your Child from Being Aggressive3," When your child sees you be aggressive, they begin to think that those behaviors are acceptable. Instead of yelling at your child, you should do your best to keep a calm and even tone. Spanking is often seen as an ineffective way of handling aggressive children because it teaches children to hit someone that they are upset with.Instead of spanking or yelling, you should talk to your child about the incident in a firm, respectful tone and, if need be, remove them from the situation.
Limit the amount of time that your child is allowed to spend with aggressive or emotionally unstable people. The longer that your child is exposed to the behavior, the more normal it seems.
When your child is young, limit their exposure to aggressive or violent games, movies, and television.

, As you minimize aggressive tendencies, you will have to show your child another option. By letting them see you interact with kindness and respect, you will set the expectation that they do the same. Make it a point to show them how you resolve conflicts without hitting.For example, you could say something to your child like, “Watch how we talk to each other when we are upset.”

, Your child will build their behaviors around how you treat others, and how you treat them. If you regularly address your child with frustration and anger, they will mimic that behavior. Talk to them in a soft, kind tone and acknowledge their feelings. If you get frustrated, you can take a minute to calm down before talking to your child.Instead of saying something like “What is wrong with you,” you could ask your child, “How are you feeling right now?”

Spend time with your child.,
Expect some setbacks.,
Offer constructive criticism.,
Make physical contact.",How to Stop Your Child from Being Aggressive4," If your child feels forgotten or ignored, they are likely to be upset. Even though they may not be able to express why they feel this way, they are likely to lash out for attention. Sometimes this lashing out is aggressive in nature., Children are constantly learning how to work with other people. As they learn, they will make mistakes and push the boundaries of what is acceptable. Avoid the urge to consider this a failure or to give up. , When you are discussing behaviors with your child, make a point to be constructive. Praise them for good behavior, and redirect them when they act aggressively. When you give them constructive criticism, point out ways that they could handle a situation more effectively, but avoid telling them that they are bad. That way, they understand that their behavior might not be acceptable, but you still love them.For example, you can say something like, “I know you are upset, but I think you could have handled the situation better. Maybe you should try talking to your friend about the toy instead of hitting them.”
Make a point to regularly praise your child for good behavior so that they are more open to you when you have to offer constructive criticism.

, When talking to your child, reach out and make physical contact. A hand on the shoulder or arm will let your child know that you are present with them and will keep their attention on you. This is especially true for young children."

Do doctor's office role play with toys.,
Learn about vaccinations together.,
Ask your child if they’d like to invite a friend.",How to Reduce the Pain of Shots for Children1," Telling your child about the injection in advance may cause them to feel worried or apprehensive. However, you can introduce your child to the idea of shots by engaging in some doctor's office role play with a toy.This will provide some familiarity for your child without frightening them.


For example, you could pretend that a stuffed animal is coming for a checkup and say something like, ""Okay Mr. Hippopotamus, time for your vaccination to keep you healthy. It will just take a second."" Then, use an object like a capped pen or crayon to mimic the motion of giving a shot on the stuffed animal.
When you take your child for their appointment, then you can remind them of the game you played and how Mr. Hippopotamus got a vaccination.;
, It may help to educate your child about the importance of shots. Find a book that explains the vaccination process in a friendly way, such as the picture book “Lion’s Aren’t Scared of Shots.” The key is to not over-prepare them, as this could make the trip appear a bigger deal than it is.


Depending on your child’s age, you may want to teach them how the immunization process works. Say this to your child: “Shots protect you by giving you a very tiny, dead piece of the germ. This germ is so small that it can’t hurt you. Instead, your body responds by making antibodies. Your body now knows how to fight this germ whenever it encounters it!""If your child is very young, the less information may be best. You may also want to use gentler language. Say this to your child: “You will get a tiny poke, but it will make your body super strong!”

, Depending on your child’s age, they may wish to bring a friend for moral support. Call the child’s parents and confirm the date ahead of time. Your child may feel better about the upcoming vaccination if they can mentally plan on their friend being there, too.

"
"
Make sure your child is in a comfortable position, such as in your lap.,
Breastfeed your infant.,
Dip your child’s pacifier in sugar.,
Stroke the skin.,
Distract your child.,
Teach your child breathing exercises.,
Cough it out.,
Use a skin-numbing product.,
Give the more painful vaccination last.",How to Reduce the Pain of Shots for Children2," Excessive restraint may increase your child’s distress, so hold and support them as gently as possible.Whichever position your child chooses, make sure they are not vaccinated while lying down, which makes children more anxious.Older children may choose to sit on the examination table. Help minimize the risk of accidental falls by standing against the examination table to provide support.

, If you’re a breastfeeding mother, consider nursing during the vaccination. Babies breastfed during their vaccination maintain a steadier heart rate. They also cry less, compared to those swaddled or given a pacifier., Reduce pain for non-breastfed infants with a sweet-tasting solution. Create a sucrose solution by missing one packet or cube of sugar with 10 ml (two teaspoons) of water in a medicine cup. You can also obtain sucrose solutions from some pharmacies. Using a syringe, place the dose in the infant’s mouth. You can also use a medicine cup or pacifier dipped in the solution. The analgesic (pain-reducing) effect of sucrose will may last up to 10 minutes., You can reduce pain at the time of injection by offering to rub or stroke the skin near the injection site. Use moderate intensity before the vaccination takes place., Distractions can soothe the child, and take his or her mind off the shots. Talk to them, tell them a joke, or give them a favorite toy to play with. Other ideas include squeezing their hand, making funny faces, telling a story, playing I Spy, or simply singing their favorite song., Slow, deep breathing works well as a relaxation strategy. If paired with an activity such as blowing bubbles, it can also serve as a distraction for focusing your young one’s attention away. Pain is reduced if the child uses breathing exercises.Try these steps when teaching your child how it's done:


Start by having your child breathe normally. Ask them if they feel which parts of their body move when they breathe.
Have them rest their hand on the belly.
Ask them to hold the air in for four seconds.
Have them slowly blow all the air out until it’s gone.
Have them repeat until they appear relaxed.

, Coughing once before and once during routine vaccinations helps reduce painful reactions for children during vaccinations. Have your child practice while waiting for the nurse. Model the behavior for them so they understand how it’s done., There are a variety of skin-numbing products on the market that may reduce immunization pain in children, such as a EMLA, which you will need a prescription from your doctor for. Also, consider trying a vapocoolant spray, which rapidly cools the area to help reduce the pain of the needle prick. Pain is significantly lower for children who used these products compared to those who don’t. Plan on applying the cream an hour before the vaccination. , If your child is receiving more than one vaccination, ask the nurse to administer the more painful vaccination second. Giving the more painful vaccine last decreases the overall pain from both injections.Vaccines known to be more painful are M-M-R-II and Prevnar. These should be given last when coupled with other vaccines."
"
Hug your child and tell them you love them.,
Give them a special treat.,
Watch your child for a fever or other symptoms.",How to Reduce the Pain of Shots for Children3," Sometimes the simple act of showing that you are there can help comfort your child. Say, “you did a great job, I’m so proud of you!” They will feel a sense of pride for their accomplishment.

, Pack a few special treats in your bag or purse such as your child’s favorite candy bar or snack. You may also want to pack a favorite drink. Another option is to offer to take your child out for ice cream or another special treat on the way home.


If your child doesn’t like sweets or if you don’t want to overload them with sugar, consider taking them to do a fun activity instead. This could be anything from stopping at the playground, playing a favorite game together at home, or renting a movie to watch at home.

, Redness and swelling at the site of the shot should not last longer than 48 hours. If your child feels warm and is acting lethargic, take their temperature. While low-grade fevers are normal, they also shouldn’t last for more than 48 hours. A temperature is considered a fever if it is 100.4 Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius taken rectally. Take your child’s temperature under the arm for more comfort.If your child has symptoms beyond what your nurse suggested than call them right away.


To reduce a fever, give your child plenty to drink. Dress your child lightly.
Only give your child medicines his doctor has approved.
Do not hesitate to take your child into the emergency room if things don’t seem right or if their temperature is above 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

"
Avoid controlling your child’s tasks and activities.,
Teach rather than critique.,
Teach them to think positively.,
Lead by example.",How to Raise Confident Children1," Confidence in children depends heavily upon support. Doing things for your child will rob them of the opportunity to learn how and what to do themselves. Instead of controlling tasks or just doing them yourself, complete them with your child so that they might learn how.Avoiding control does not mean losing authority. You can be authoritative without creating a dependence for your child being told what to do.Don’t redo tasks they’ve already completed. If the way they’ve finished something is an issue, use it as a learning opportunity and redo the task together.;
, Raising confident children often means helping them discover and learn from each experience, and there’s no better way than to take advantage of each learning opportunity. When your child tries to complete a task, whether new or already known, take the time to ask the questions to engage their problem solving skills rather than pointing out where they went wrong.Spend time teaching your child an activity that you know how to do. Teaching them an activity you are already familiar with will help you set up manageable goals.If you notice your child having difficulty with a task, whether it is a toy, cleaning up, using cutlery, or playing, avoid giving criticism like “You’re doing that wrong,” or, “That’s not how you do that.” Instead, try asking engaging questions that can further their involvement, like “What are you trying to do?”; “Would you like to see how I do that?”; “That doesn’t seem to be working; is there another way you could do it?”; or “Would you like my help?”
Try making something from start to finish, like a birdhouse or puzzle, to teach patience, problem solving skills, and the rewards of completing a task.

, Teach them that not everything should be negative, and to keep on the positive side of life. Tell them that if they catch themselves thinking negatively, to stop, rethink, and remember that anything can be positive.


If they're negative about a problem, instead of feeling negative, tell them to solve the problem, and even help them solve it.
Try asking questions like “Is there anything you can do to solve this problem?” or “What can I do to help you?”

, Modeling positive self confidence will provide a key examples of what self confidence looks and acts like. Children are constantly picking up and absorbing other’s actions and behaviors. Be sure to set a good example and be as confident as you can be!Don’t put yourself down, be overly critical of yourself or others, and don’t talk badly about others in front of your child. Instead, promote confidence by speaking positively and affirming your own actions. Instead of saying “I did such a bad job,” try saying things like “That was really difficult. I’m happy with my effort but there is plenty of room for improvement.”
It is important for parents to model ownership of mistakes and show their children that they still have confidence and are secure in their self-worth.
Try banning negative statements, like “I suck at this,” or, “I’m such an idiot.”

"
"
Encourage practice.,
Appreciate effort.,
Acknowledge their courage to try new things.,
Encourage curiosity.",How to Raise Confident Children2," Encourage your child to spend time practicing whatever it is that they are interested in. Practicing can also be instrumental in teaching lessons about adversity and mistakes, as well as instilling the promise that improvement will follow.Help create and manage a schedule of when your child can practice.
Remind your child of all the rewards that come with practice. Try saying things like “Keep practicing and you’ll be able to master the scales and move on to the next piano practice book,” or “You’re doing so well, keep it up!”
Encouraging does not mean pressuring. Be sure to take the time to listen to your child and have conversations about quitting and moving on.

, Appreciating effort over results will help your child build confidence in their own abilities and self worth rather than what others may think about them. The more their effort is encouraged, the more willing they will be to take risks and try new things.Remember to teach them that winning is admirable but not the definition of worth and value. Their effort is reflective of their character.


Appreciating effort can be the difference between telling your child how proud you are for how hard they studied rather than how proud you are because they received a high mark.
Try acknowledging their effort by saying “I’m very proud of how hard you studied” or “I’m very proud of all the time, effort, and practice you’ve been putting in.”

, Trying new things, at whatever age, takes courage and risk. Acknowledging and encouraging your child’s willingness to try new things will not only instill a sense of confidence in them, but will also provide them with opportunities to learn on their own and from their own mistakes.


Give them positive verbal reinforcement by using phrases like “I’m so proud of you for jumping in and trying your best,” or “I’m really impressed by how willing you are to try new things.”
Asking questions, like “How did you feel trying out the school choir?” or, “Did you enjoy trying science camp for the first time?” can allow your child to reflect and show your interest in their courage to try new things.
Trying new things can be difficult. Treat this as another opportunity to encourage their perseverance and motivate them to continue trying!, A child’s endless stream of questions can often be tiresome, but it should nevertheless still be encouraged. Encouraging your child’s curiosity will help expose them to the idea that there are many things they don’t know. The more curious they are about learning and taking in new information, the more confidence they will gather around their ability to learn on their own.Instead of immediately indulging your child’s question with an answer, try asking a follow up question that will make them think about what the answer might be, like “I don’t know, why do you think that is?” or, “I haven’t thought about it like that, what do you think?”

Decide what your limits are.,
Establish rules for all forms of media.,
Limit how much technology the sitter can use while working.,
Write specific rules.",How to Set Social Media Boundaries with a Babysitter1," It is important that both you and the babysitter understand the exact boundaries that exist for social media usage. Before you write down rules, carefully consider what you are and are not comfortable with being posted online. For example, you may be comfortable with pictures of your children being posted on Facebook, as long as only close family members and friends can see them. Or you may not want photos being posted online at all.Ask yourself:


Do you care if the sitter posts status updates or blog posts about working for your family? If so, would you prefer that your name or children’s names not be used?
Are you comfortable with pictures of your children being posted online? If so, who are you comfortable with seeing your photos? Are you comfortable with being “tagged” in these posts?
Are you comfortable with pictures of your home being posted online?
Do you mind if the babysitter video chats a friend while they are babysitting? If so, are you comfortable with your children interacting with these friends on video chat?
Do you mind if the sitter uses apps or games that use location tracking?;
, It is important that you consider all different forms of sharing that occur over the internet. Babysitters have the possibility of sharing photographs of your family, complaints about their job, details of your home, and their physical location through GPS and tracking services. In addition, they may think it is all right to call friends or take video of things that occur within the home.As you establish rules, consider various forms of sharing, including:


Social media pages like Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus
Photo apps like Instagram and Snapchat
Video chatting services like Skype and Facetime
Geotracking apps and games like Pokemon Go and Foursquare

, If you are worried about your sitter using social media instead of watching your children, you should set firm boundaries about when they can and cannot use technology like phones, tablets, or computers.Ask yourself:


Is the sitter expected not to use computers or phones at all while babysitting? Can they use them if the children are asleep? Can they use their phone to contact their parents, ride, or you while babysitting? If they are students, can they use computers to do homework while babysitting?
Can the babysitter take pictures of the children? Can they send you pictures of the children, as long as they do not post them online?
If the babysitter is allowed to use phones or computers, do you want your children using their phones or computers? Can the children play games on their phone? Is the child allowed to take pictures using their phone?

, Once you have considered your own boundaries and limits, create a set of specific rules that the babysitter can follow while watching your children.Some rules you might set include:


No posting pictures on any social media app.
No sending pictures to friends.
Do not mention the family by name on any public forum.
Location settings on the phone must be turned off.
The babysitter may not accept or make calls while babysitting, unless it is an emergency. This includes video chat.
The babysitter may not use their phone to text, post, or read social media sites until the children are asleep.

"
"
Discuss before you hire.,
Define limits for an old babysitter.,
Explain your reasons for the rules.,
Ask the babysitter what social media accounts they use.,
Hand them a list of rules.,
Thank them for their cooperation.",How to Set Social Media Boundaries with a Babysitter2," It is best to establish these rules before you hire a babysitter. As you’re interviewing the babysitter, make your stance on social media clear. Inform them if you do not want them posting pictures on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram. Tell them if you will require that they turn their location settings off or if they must abstain from all technology while babysitting.You can say, “Before we hire you, we want to make it clear that we do not want any pictures of our children on social media. Even if you have privacy settings activated, we would feel more comfortable if our children’s pictures were not on the internet.”
If you don’t want them using social media at all while at your house, you can say, “We expect that while you are watching our children, you will not be Skyping or chatting with friends on Facebook.”

, If you already have hired a babysitter or have been using a babysitter for a while, you should start the conversation as soon as possible.The next time they come to babysit, ask them if they can arrive a few minutes early so that you can discuss some new rules.


If your babysitter has not infringed on your social media boundaries, let them know that you are not accusing them. Say, “I know this hasn’t been an issue before, but I realize that we’ve never discussed my social media boundaries with you before. I just want to make sure that we completely understand each other on this matter.”
If the babysitter has posted or done something that causes you concern, gently ask them if they would refrain from doing it in the future. You can say, “I know you have been sending pictures of my child to your friends. While I love it when you text me pictures of the kids, I am not comfortable with strangers receiving pictures of them.”, Some babysitters, especially younger ones, may be very comfortable with social media, or they may believe that their privacy settings protect them. Make it clear that even with high privacy settings, you do not want information or pictures posted about your children. If you explain your reasons why, they may be more likely to follow your rules.


If you don’t want pictures posted, you can say, “It makes us very uncomfortable when strangers see pictures of our children. Many people can steal these pictures very easily.”If you don’t want them posting their location or geotags, you can say, “When you’re alone with the kids, we don’t necessarily want people on the internet to know exactly where you are or what the kids are doing. This might attract predators.”If you’re nervous about them complaining or posting information about your family online, you can say, “We hope that you trust us, and if you have a problem with anything that you come to us first. We expect you to respect our privacy, as we respect yours.”

, Ask the babysitter if they would be comfortable giving you links to any public social media accounts. If they do not want to give you the exact accounts, you can ask them what apps they use so that you can address specific usage rules.If they have a blog, you can ask them what the blog is about. If it is all related to child care, you might remind them if you do not want your family to be discussed on their blog. You can say, “We would appreciate it if you didn’t mention our family on the blog.”
Many people believe that photo apps like Snapchat are safe to use because the photo disappears after 15 seconds. That said, people can still screencap these photos and share them. If your sitter uses Snapchat, remind them that the same rules apply., Once you have had the discussion, you should make sure that these rules are written and given to your babysitter. If you have an information list or employment contract already made for your babysitter, you can add your social media guidelines to this document., At the end of the conversation, you should let them know that you appreciate what they are doing for you. It can be increasingly difficult for people to disconnect from the internet, so let them how grateful you are.


You can say, “I know it’s hard to avoid using your phone, but we really appreciate you following these rules. They really give us peace of mind knowing that you’re respecting the children's privacy as well as our own.”

"
"
Remind the sitter occasionally.,
Add the babysitter as a friend on social media.,
Talk to your children.,
Warn the sitter after one rule break.,
Fire them if they continue.",How to Set Social Media Boundaries with a Babysitter3," It does not hurt to reinforce the rules that you have set, either by having periodic conversations with your babysitter about social media use or by casually mentioning it in a conversation.Do not accuse the babysitter if you have no evidence of them sharing on social media, but do let them know these rules are serious. You can say something like:


“I just want to remind you that we’re not very comfortable with information about our family being posted online.”
“The pictures you sent of the kids was adorable. You’re not posting these online, right?”
“Have fun with the kids tonight. Remember, no phones or computers before they go to bed.”

, If you know the babysitter well enough, you might send a friend request to them on social media. This will help you monitor what they post while they are babysitting. Remember that if you do this, the babysitter will also be able to see your profile and account, so be absolutely certain that you are comfortable friending them.Some babysitters might be uncomfortable with this. This does not mean that they are hiding something; rather, they want to protect their own privacy. In this situation, you can say, “I understand. I just hope that you will protect our children’s privacy in the same way.”

, If you don’t feel comfortable watching the babysitter’s social media accounts, you might also see if your children can tell you what the babysitter is up to. You might ask the children how the babysitter was and what they did together.


If you want to be direct, you can even ask your children, “Was the babysitter on their phone a lot? Did you use their phone at all?”

, If you have caught the babysitter breaking the rules, you should determine how serious the infringement is. If they have posted one picture or mentioned something about the children online, you might decide to give them a warning.


You can say, “I know you posted a picture on Facebook. I just want to remind you that we are very serious about the social media boundaries that we have set, and we expect you not to do this in the future.”
You can also give them a gentle reminder, such as “You might not have realized this, but you left your location settings on Facebook, and everyone could see exactly where you were when you were babysitting.”

, If there are multiple infractions or the babysitter posts something seriously invasive, you might consider finding another babysitter. Examples of a serious situation might be the babysitter publically complaining about your family, the babysitter posting or skyping when they should be watching your children, or the babysitter continuing to post pictures after you have asked them to stop. Inform the babysitter that you are not comfortable with employing someone who has disrespected their boundaries.


If you gave them a written list of rules or if you have an employment contract, refer to it.Say, “I gave you these rules, and you agreed to them, yet you have continued to post things on social media that I am not comfortable with. I’m afraid I have to let you go.”
Inform the next babysitter why you fired the last one. You can say, “I had to fire the last babysitter because they broke my rules on social media use. These boundaries are very serious to me, and I hope that you will respect these rules.”

Start teaching good behavior young.,
Set a good example.,
NEVER abuse your child.,
Punish your child accordingly.,
Teach them to share.,
Teach them what is right and what is wrong.Drugs and premature sex,for example,should be taught around age 10 or 11 .Never say,""Don't do that"" or they will find it as a way to rebel.

,
Make them do chores.,
Reward good behavior.,
Do not be too strict.,
Be more of a friend to your kid.,
Make sure they feel like they can tell you anything.,
Don't spy on them.,
Teach them good morals.,
Make sure they have good goals.,
Don't make too big a deals out of things.

",How to Raise Well Mannered Children," Children as early as 12 months old can start learning manners. The earlier, the better.;
, You cannot expect your kid to be good and kind if you do drugs and curse. This is being a hypocrite, and is just plain wrong. If you have other adults living with you and they behave poorly, ask them to not do it around your child/children.

, Abused children after grow up with low-self esteem and most become abusers themselves. If you know or think they are being abused, take action ASAP. This accounts for all abuse, including neglect, physical, emotional, or sexual.

, The following will help, but will need to be adjusted sometimes.


1-2:Instead of punishment,correct your child. Time outs may be needed if the child doesn't correct their behavior.
3-7:Taking a toy away for a day or two or a short time-out.
8-10:Send the child to bed early. Most children this age will hate this. Groundings for severe things may help depending on your child.
11-14:This is often a difficult age to punish. Most of the time taking away favorite electrons for a short period of time(5-8 hours) or short groundings(2-6 days)
15-to legal adult: This really depends on what your child did. Not allowing friends over, longer groundings(say 7-14 days) may be effective.

, Kids do need to know that some things should not be shared (underwear,toothbrush, etc.)

,, Chores will teach them that not everything will be done for them. If you have more than one child, make them take turns doing certain chores.Children under 3 years are not ready for chores and children under 9 should be supervised when feeding pets or doing dishes.Split chores equally between family members.A good idea is to have a chart saying who will do what on a weekly basis.

, If your child is 7 or older a weekly allowance is a good idea. Even ""I like how you said please at dinner tonight,"" will help your child feel proud. Avoid food as an award, because this can cause unhealthy eating later in life.

, Remember, some parents think all it takes is discipline and don't realize they are being hard or strict on their kids. This kind of parenting is only pushing the kid/teen away and will make them want to hide stuff from you. Simply because they want more freedom or feel that you are being too strict.

, At any age even if they have plenty of friends. It's easier to be honest with someone that's your friend instead of your ""crazy"" mom/dad.

, Talk to them a lot, be a close parent and tell them they can tell you anything. Also be open and honest with them.

, In most cases this will just make them upset and draw you two apart. Unless you have a reason or feel they are hiding something REALLY bad from you there is no need to go spy on your children and will most likely just make them want to hide stuff from you.

, The older a kid gets, the more they will need to know WHY things are wrong. They might not tell you this, but you need to explain to them exactly why bad things are bad. Because you don't want them finding out the hard why. Make sure they fully understand why things are bad.

, And want to do something with their life. Be supportive. Help him/her with whatever they want to do.

Enroll your child in day care, nursery school and after school activities.,
Encourage close relationships early.,
Preserve adult-only time.,
Teach your only child to pay attention to others.,
Ensure that adults make the decisions.,
Teach responsibility.,
Provide support, but remember you are a parent, not a friend.,
Keep up with developmental stages.",How to Raise an Only Child," Interacting with other children will teach sharing, empathy and the ability to stand up for one's self.


Present options for group activities and sports. For example, joining a soccer team rather than playing singles tennis might be better for an only child to feel like he or she is part of a group.;
, Even if your child does not have siblings, becoming close with cousins, neighbors and good friends can provide the same type of bond.

, An only child often feels like one of the adults when there are no other children around. It is important to establish boundaries of adult and child time.


Leave your child with friends, relatives or a babysitter for adult evenings out. You can still have family time throughout the week, but make a conscious effort to teach your child that he or she cannot always expect to be included in what you do and where you go.

, This will help your child understand how to help others and consider their needs.

, It can be common for an only child to dictate meal plans and shopping preferences, but remember that adults need to make adult decisions.


Encourage input, but maintain your decision making power. For example, if a child wants hot dogs for dinner but you have already decided on meatloaf, explain that you are cooking meatloaf, but allow your child to pick between broccoli or corn as the side dish.

, When you have 3 or 4 kids, you might divide up chores so the dishes get done and the toys get picked up. With only 1 child in the house, the mess might be smaller but you still need to hold your child accountable for cleaning it up.

, Parents of an only child might slip into the role of confidante more easily than parents of multiple children.


Allow your child to form other adult relationships. Try not to feel threatened or disappointed if your child turns to other adults for advice, support or help. This is normal, and similar to a child with siblings going to them for help instead of a parent.

, Teach shoelace tying, bike riding, swimming and other milestones at the same pace of your child's peers.

This can result in you becoming uncharacteristically angry at your kids, and even lead you to shout at them or say something you don't really mean.


When this happens, give yourself a break for at least ten minutes, where you sit down and take a deep breath. It’s not unusual to feel awful, upset, and frustrated after a hard day.
Try counting to 10 to help yourself calm down or just remove yourself from the situation completely by going to your room for a few minutes. If you need to cry to release your frustration, do so.;
, Everyone makes mistakes. The important thing is that you acknowledge your bad mood and take ownership of any angry or hurtful things you said to your child while feeling low. Then you need to forgive yourself and forget about any feelings of guilt in order for you to heal, move on and reconnect with your child.


Think of this as an opportunity for you to grow and improve. If you need to, call your partner or a friend to vent any remaining feelings of anger and frustration, so you can get them off your chest and move on
When you have overcome all of your negative emotions, it will be much easier to reach out to your child and reconnect with them.

, When you are ready to reach out to your child, start by gently touching him on the shoulder or hand. This forms a physical connection between the two of you and helps you to reconnect with each other.


If your child has been crying, wipe away his tears and give him a hug. Show him how much you love him through your warm embrace.
This is is especially important if you unintentionally hurt his feelings during your bad mood.

, If you spoke harshly or said something you didn't mean while you were in a bad mood, it's recommended that you own up to this and make an effort to apologize to your child.


Make the apology as sincere and heartfelt as possible. Acknowledge that you hurt the child's feelings and express your desire to make amends. This sets a good example for your child, as you are owning up to what you did and making amends for it. Through this, your child will learn the correct way to deal with his mistakes.
Young children will usually forgive pretty easily, but older kids or teenagers might need some extra time to think about things. Give them some space for a while, as long as you have apologized they will get over their anger pretty quickly.

, After you have apologized, calmly discuss what happened and why you reacted the way you did. Explain that you had a bad day and that you were looking forward to coming home and relaxing.


Explain how it made you feel when you came home and the house was a mess, your child hadn't done their homework and immediately started complaining about being hungry and asking what was for dinner.
Gently prompt your child to suggest some ways in which he could have helped the situation. Could he have done his homework and chores before Mom got home, like he was asked? Could he have made himself a snack?
Allow the child to see the error of his ways, and suggest that maybe next time you could both be a little more understanding of each other and help each other out.
Do not forget to tell your child how much you love him despite everything that happened.

, Your child did his part when he accepted your apology; it’s now your turn to forgive him for his mistakes. When you forgive your child, it also means you accept him for who he is and give him the potential to be a better person.

, You can avoid future confrontations by teaching your child a few simple rules regarding patience and responsibility. For example, you shouldn't immediately give in to your child's whining when he wants something. Teach him patience by telling him, “Please wait for me to get this laundry done first (without hearing you whine) before we go out and play.”


In this way, you teach him how to manage his emotions while patiently obeying your instructions. You may also ask him to assist you with an easy task like sorting clothes by color, explaining that the more help he provides, the faster you will get through your chores and do something fun.
For your teen, you can give him a list of daily chores to help you with your busy schedule, and assign a set amount of study time. You may motivate him by giving him a reward like a new video game if he gets high grades and finishes all the chores in his list. This teaches responsibility and rewards good behavior.

, With all of the things that happened, you both deserve some activities to help you restore the connection with each other. Think of the things that your child loves doing.


Some activities you might want to try with a younger child include: story-reading, drawing/coloring, scrapbooking, finger-painting, biking, kite-flying, stargazing, doing origami, blowing bubbles, teaching a new song, playing with puzzles/building blocks, indoor treasure hunting, visiting a zoo/museum, walking your dog, horseback riding, going to beach/playground, eating ice cream together, etc.
While some activities you might want to try with your teen are: movie-watching, baking/cooking, crafting, painting, knitting, shopping, swimming, fishing, skiing, bowling, skateboarding, dancing exercises, playing with musical instruments, having a picnic, planting a tree, visiting family/friends, going to a coffee shop/massage center together, etc.

, Joke around or talk about something funny. Laughter is healthy since it helps to fight stress and triggers the release of happy hormones in the body. By laughing with your child, you are actually encouraging him to enjoy your company and to have a sense of humor and a positive outlook on life.

, Taking a few minutes to lie down with your child in bed is a wonderful opportunity to have a more intimate conversation with him. Ask him about his day, look at the stars, ask him what he's going to dream about, or say some prayers together. This should be a pleasant, peaceful time for the two of you.


This is more appropriate for young children than teens. For teens you could ask them if they'd like to join you for a cup of tea before they go to bed. You don't need to do this every night, but even a 15 minute conversation once a week can really help you to connect with your child.
Before your child goes to bed, kiss him good night then tell him that tomorrow is going to be a better day for both of you.

, Making mistakes doesn’t make you terrible, as long as you use them as an opportunity to improve.


You must remember that the more you call yourself names and put yourself down, the more you will start to believe it. Your character is defined by what you say you are.
Tell yourself that you're a good parent, then make an effort to live up to that statement. Realize your value as a person and understand that you need to respect yourself if you want your child to respect you as well.

, The ability to recognize when you need to step away for a moment and calm down provides you with a clearer perspective on how to react in a particular situation.


If you are able to remove yourself from a situation and take a few moments to gather your thoughts, this is a positive development, as it will prevent you from yelling at your child and saying things you don't mean.
Keep a stress ball with you. Squeezing it will help to release some of the tension and frustration that you're feeling.

, Instead, focus on thinking of what you need to do to turn the situation around.


Practice writing positive things in a journal, like the things that you are grateful for or happy memories with your child.
Then, when you have had a bad day and you're in a bad mood, think back to what you've written in your journal.

, Why not change the way you think about having a bad day? When you come home after a bad take, take it as a great opportunity for you to turn your bad day around by spending a fun evening with your child.


When you do this, you are not only helping yourself but you are also building a stronger and happier relationship with your child.

, Always remember that your child learns behavior by what he sees from you. For example, if you deal with a bad day by yelling, he will also deal with any negative emotions he feels by yelling (or whining).


If this is not the type of behavior you wish to encourage in your child, then you need to work on your own responses to negativity.

, It is your responsibility to make sure that the bond with your child stays strong. When you maintain this, it will be easier for him to respond positively to you and to listen to you more. You will notice that he will also be better in cooperating with you.

, The next time you have a bad day, make an effort to practice self-control and avoid lashing out angrily at your child, as this will only hurt your relationship. Keep in mind that you always have a choice between controlling a bad situation and letting a bad situation control you.

Make notes on your baby's routine.,
Make a schedule based on your baby's natural rhythms.,
Try to set a standard wake-up time.,
The first thing to do is set a wake up time.,
Feed, change and play with your baby.,
Allow the baby to sleep for another 2 to 3 hours.,
Repeat this cycle throughout the day.,
Differentiate between daytime sleeping and nighttime sleeping.,
Feed your baby when she's hungry.,
Feed the baby every 2 to 3 hour when breastfeeding.,
Learn the language of crying.,
Set a time to sleep.,
At night, reduce the noise levels.,
Reduce the light.,
Prepare for your baby to wake up throughout the night.,
Stick to your schedule as much as possible.",How to Put Your Newborn on a Schedule," Before you get started, it's a good idea to buy a notebook in which you keep track of your baby's daily schedule. This will help you to identify whether your new schedule is working.


On the first page of the notebook create a simple table with the following columns: time, activity, note. Make a note of every major daily activity throughout the day, on every day of the week. For example: 6 am: Baby wakes up, 9 am: Baby is fed, 11 am : Baby goes for a nap etc.
Alternatively, you can keep track of your baby's schedule on a computer spreadsheet or use an online tracker service such as Trixie Tracker or baby insights.;
, Try to find out if there is any regularity in your baby's current cycle of eating and sleeping.


If you notice that your baby tends to need a diaper change or gets cranky at a certain time of day, you can try to incorporate that into your schedule.
This will make adjusting to your new schedule easier and will help you to plan your day around your baby's needs.
A baby that is not sleep-deprived or hungry will be much happier and more willing to play, cuddle and learn new things.

, Newborn babies usually sleep a lot during the day. In fact, for the first few weeks they need 16 hours of sleep a day.


Since sleep is a major activity for infants, it is necessary to introduce some order into this “sleeping activity”, to prevent them from waking up in the middle of the night.

, Though it may be hard, you'll have to wake your baby up at the same time each day, even if they're sleeping. If they tend to wake-up before your preferred wake-up time, you'll have to adjust their nap schedule so they sleep later.

, Once the baby is up, change her diaper and get her dressed for the day. Then, hold her close to you and let her eat. Whether you breastfeed or formula feed, your baby needs your closeness.


After the eating play with your baby. Talk to her, sing to her, cuddle her. She will enjoy your smell, your voice and your nearness.
After playtime, put the baby down for a nap. Do as soon as you notice signs of fatigue, such as yawning, irritability, crying, rubbing the nose.

, The baby will probably wake up after 2-3 hours. In the event that she does not wake up, you should wake her. A baby who sleeps too much will not eat enough throughout the day and can become dehydrated and lose weight.

, You can repeat the above-mentioned cycle throughout the day, except that it is advisable to feed the baby, before you change their diaper and play. Many babies ruin the diaper while eating. This way you avoid doing that twice. So:


Wake the baby from her nap
Feed the baby
Change the diaper, then play with your baby for a while, talking, singing, cuddling.
Put the baby back to sleep.

, In order to set a schedule here your baby sleeps through the night, it's important to distinguish between nighttime sleeping and daytime napping.


You can do this by letting the baby sleep in a bright room during the day, and a dark room at nighttime. Putting the baby down for a nap in a dark room will simply confuse her and throw her sleeping pattern off.
Also, don't be afraid to make noise when the baby is napping during the day - she needs to learn to get used to this. Leave the radio on, do the vacuuming, and speak at your normal volume.

, It's important to note that you should always feed your baby when she's hungry, even if it does not fit into your schedule.


It's not fair to let a newborn go hungry just because feeding doesn't fit into your schedule.
Signs that your baby is hungry include crying and sucking her hand.

, If the infant is not crying and not looking to eat, you should still feed her two or three hours. This is especially important in breastfeeding.


If the baby does not eat at this rate, the mother's breasts can become overwhelmed with milk, which can be painful for the mother and make it more difficult for the baby to feed.
If your baby is eating too often, the mother's breast does not have time to accumulate enough milk and the quality and quantity of the milk suffers. In this case, the baby may be hungry all the time, even though she constantly eating.

, The newborn communicates with her crying, and you'll soon come to recognize if your baby is crying because she is hungry or because she is nervous or in pain.

, Observe your baby's natural schedule and find out what bedtime fits the best. Keeping a diary will be helpful for this too .


Do not play too much with a newborn before bedtime. It may be too stimulating, making it more difficult for the newborn to fall asleep.
Give your baby a bath before bedtime and massage hr skin with some milk or baby oil. This will relax your baby before sleep.

, Sing your baby a lullaby or play some soft, quiet music to get her to sleep. Sing even you are not adept at singing. Your baby loves your voice and is not a music critic.


Keep the rest of the house as quiet as possible at nighttime. A quiet, peaceful environment will indicate to your baby that this isn't just an ordinary nap.

, Put your baby to sleep in a dimly lit room. Do not turn off the lights completely. You always have to see your child. The darkened environment will help her to sleep through the night.

, The baby will probably wake up during the night. When this happens, take her in your arms, feed her and put her back to sleep. Do not change diapers, unless it is really necessary. That part is omitted from the night schedule, along with playing and cuddling.


If the baby does not wake during the night to eat, wake her. No matter how good it may sound to let a newborn sleep all night, it's not healthy for them.
Babies need to eat every 2-3 hours. Otherwise, the baby may be dehydrated and hungry, which causes fatigue and weakness.

, It's important to stick to your schedule as much as possible, especially the going to bed and waking up times. In this way, it will be easier for your baby to get used to it. However, keep in mind that over time, your baby will sleep less and will require more of your attention and time.

Place your child on their back so they can sleep as safely as possible.,
Use both of your hands for support.,
Place your infant into bed from the cradle position.,
Remove other items that are in the bed.,
Keep your child’s body temperature in mind.",How to Position an Infant for Sleep1," According to most medical professionals, the ideal sleeping position for an infant is on their back in the center of a crib, bassinet, or other infant bed. An infant can easily be maneuvered to lie on their back in the center of their bed from any position they were in when they fell asleep.


The following steps will help you to move your baby from your arms into a comfortable sleeping position on their bed.;
, If your child fell asleep on their tummy against your torso, use one hand to support your baby’s head and neck, while the other hand supports their bottom while you carry them to bed. This position works because it allows you to lean over your infant’s bed and ease your infant’s body away from your own until their bottom is touching the bed.


The hand that was supporting your infant’s bottom can be pulled away, and your infant’s head can be eased onto the bed.

, If your baby fell asleep while cradled in your arms, you can carry them to bed in that position, or maneuver them so that they are in the position described in the previous step.


Once you get your child to the bed, lean over until your arms are touching the bed, and then gently slide your arm out from under your child’s bottom, so that the bottom rests on the bed. Next, slide the other arm away so that your child is fully lying on the bed.

, You must make sure that items in your child’s bed do not pose a threat to their safety. Although stuffed animals, fluffy blankets, decorative pillows, and crib bumpers might look cute, they could pose a choking hazard to your sleeping baby.


If your baby rolls too close to these items, they could suffocate, so it is very important that you remove these items.

, If the room temperature cannot be adjusted to keep your infant warm enough, you can dress your child in light layers of clothing, such as a larger sleeper or a sleep sack over the sleeper they normally wear.

Store loose batteries in a safe place.,
Keep devices with batteries out of reach.,
Kid-proof battery-operated devices.,
Inspect your child’s toys carefully.,
Make sure your child is playing with age appropriate toys.,
Talk to your child about the dangers of batteries.",How to Prevent Children from Swallowing Batteries1," No matter the size of the battery, you should store all loose batteries in a safe place that is out of the reach of children. This includes batteries that you throw away. Any battery that a child comes across can be picked up and swallowed.Drawers may not be a safe place. If your child can open a drawer, they can reach in and grab the battery. Store them someplace up high out of reach, in boxes or containers that cannot be opened.;
, Any device that has a battery in it is a potential risk for your children. Kids can easily remove the back off of a remote or other device and remove the battery. If they do this without your knowledge, they can quickly put the battery in their mouth and swallow it.Keep remotes, battery powered electronics, and anything else that has an easily accessible battery out of the reach of children. Place them on high shelves and in places they can’t climb to reach.
Many common items contain small button batteries, which pose a great risk for children. Greeting cards that make noise, digital scales, calculators, LED tea light candles, key fobs, and even flashing jewelry contain these types of batteries., It may not be possible to keep everything out of the reach of your child. For instance, you may not always remember to pick up the remote after watching television. There are ways you can kid-proof the devices in your home that need batteries. If you think there is a risk of someone in your home leaving items containing batteries around your home, find ways to kid-proof them.


For example, you may want to buy devices that use screws to hold the battery cover into place instead of the pop tab.
Consider placing several pieces of duct tape over the battery door of items like remotes so your child can’t easily get the batteries.

, Many children’s toys have batteries, and some even use the small round “button” batteries. Before letting your child use a battery-operated toy without your supervision, check the toy carefully. Find out what type of batteries it uses and how easily it is to get to the batteries.If the batteries are easily accessible, try using duct tape to tape over it.
Reconsider any toy that may present a battery hazard, especially if your child has a habit of putting things in their mouth.
Think twice before buying cheaper toys from discount stores that require batteries. They may not have been manufactured with the same safety guidelines as other toys., Most toys made for certain age ranges are developed with the child’s safety in mind. That means that the toy’s battery source shouldn’t be easily accessible. However, some children play with toys that are intended for older children. Ensuring that your child plays with toys intended for their age can help to keep them safe.If you let your child play with toys that are made for older children, always supervise them while they are playing.
Teach older siblings the dangers of batteries and tell them not to let younger siblings play with them. If the older sibling is responsible, you may want to ask them to watch their younger siblings while playing to make sure they don’t eat batteries., You should teach your child about batteries. Show them what batteries are so they are familiar with how they look. Tell them that they are not food, candy, or a toy and should not be put in their mouths.Tell your children that swallowing batteries can be dangerous and make them very sick.

Use floor activity centers and activity quilts.,
Work those hands!,
Read!",How to Play with Children in the Church Nursery2," Rattles are fine, as long as they make noise! Play with squeaky toys. Musical toys or toys that talk to you are great as well. At this age children will most likely play with the toys themselves  though you may need to show them how to play with the toy!

, This age of infants will enjoy shape sorters or activity boards that have open and shut items on them. You can play, they can play!

, Nesting cups and toys are fun and are good for small motor skill development. Push and pull toys such as small wagons work well for play, too! Play with any safe and age-appropriate toys that can be pushed, pulled, stacked, or knocked down.

, Lay the child on an activity quilt or in front of an activity center. Play along right beside them. Choose activity centers that do not consist of choking hazards and that are made for small children.

, Play with toys that can be squeezed such as a soft, toy cube. Throw and drop balls. Any safe toys that can be dropped are fun to drop, too. Roll a cube or ball. Keep up with practicing those fine motor skills!

, Let the child look at books or read out loud to the child. Encourage them to interact by choosing books that are cloth, have textures to feel, have scents to smell. Also try books with knobs to turn.

Bring out the plush toys and dolls!,
Try toys that are colorful and look real.,
Practice physical skills.,
Play pretend.,
Read books!,
Blow bubbles!",How to Play with Children in the Church Nursery3," Toddlers love to carry around plush toys and dolls. They may also enjoy feeding them, diapering them, or rocking them. Play along with the toddler and encourage parallel play, though they will rarely interact with each other.

, A plastic school bus that is bright, but looks real is an example. Another example is a real looking doll with bright clothing. Flashcards or pictures of something bright and real are also another example. Anything that is bright, but looks real!

, Provide a small climbing gym for toddlers to play on. Go in a gym and run around, if your church nursery has one. Roll and throw balls. Tumble on mats, hop on one foot. Keep moving and build up their self-esteem through praise!


Children this age will also like to push and pull. They can pull wagons and push play strollers or vacuum cleaners. Dumping water in a water table is also fun. Stack blocks and knock them down. Work those hands.

, Toddlers love to imitate grown-ups. Playing with dolls is one way. Playing in a pretend kitchen and ""cooking"" a meal with fake food is another. Wearing purses, carrying work bags, putting on play jewelry-all exciting. Try to start a game of house where the toddlers help out in the house. Taking care of babies, cooking, cleaning, and going to work.

, Try short story times and let the toddlers look at books together. Read to them, but keep it short! Hold their attention with a pop-up book, a smell book, a texture book, or knobs and dials in the book. Sing some songs as you go along or introduce some rhymes.

, Have a worker blow the bubbles and let the children play a popping game. You can even let some toddlers blow bubbles while you hold the bubble wand.

Take your child to the emergency room.,
Avoid making your child vomit.,
Refrain from giving your child anything to eat or drink.,
Do not give the Heimlich maneuver.",How to Prevent Children from Swallowing Batteries2," If you suspect that your child has swallowed any kind of battery, immediately take them to the emergency room or contact emergency services. Batteries can do damage to a child’s body in a short amount of time.Don’t wait for any symptoms to develop before taking your child to the emergency room. Take them immediately before any damage can start.

, If you believe your child has swallowed a battery, you may think that you should make your child vomit so they can get it out of their system. You should not do this or give the child anything to make them vomit. Moving the battery can lead to increased risk of harm.You should also not give your child anything to make them go to the bathroom. Batteries can pass through stools, but you should not try to force this to happen.

, You should not give your child anything to drink or eat to try and force the battery through the body. When a battery is in the esophagus, it has the potential to do severe damage.Giving the child something to drink or eat can move the battery or cause a negative reaction that can burn or severely injure your child’s insides. It could also interfere with a doctor's methods of getting the battery out.

, If your child has swallowed a battery and it is stuck in their throat, you may think that you should give your child the Heimlich maneuver to try to remove it. You should not do this because it can move the battery, which can cause severe damage, cause it to get stuck somewhere else, or make it an even more serious choking hazard.Batteries also present a choking hazard, which needs to be dealt with by medical professionals.
If your child is having difficulty breathing or is actively choking, you should call 911 and consider trying the Heimlich maneuver (or an age-appropriate method, for babies). You should follow the appropriate choking guidelines for the child's age and level of consciousness.

Recognize the symptoms of a swallowed battery.,
Identify other battery risks.,
Know the dangers of lithium batteries in the body.",How to Prevent Children from Swallowing Batteries3," Your child may show no symptoms if they swallow a battery. They may show signs that look like an infection or another condition. You should take your child to the doctor if you notice any of the following symptoms, especially if they are unexplained or occur suddenly, or if you think your child may have swallowed a battery:Coughing
Drooling
Pain or discomfort
Fever
Abdominal pain
Vomiting
Bloody stools

, Children do not just swallow small objects like batteries. They also may take small batteries and stick them in their ears or nose. This can also cause major damage to the sinus or ear cavities. The child may experience pain in the ear or the nose due to the object’s insertion.Batteries in the ear or nose can cause damage to the tissue, leading to problems like facial paralysis, hearing loss, and nasal septal perforation.

, The majority of battery injuries treated at emergency rooms are due to lithium “button” batteries being swallowed. Button batteries stick in the child’s throat and esophagus. When saliva or other liquid touches the battery, it causes an electrical current, which leads to severe burning of the esophagus. This can happen in only two hours. Lithium batteries can cause so much internal damage and bleeding that it can lead to death.Damage and burning can continue even after the battery is removed.
Children five and under are at the greatest risk.

Determine what the child’s speech difficulties.,
Choose the appropriate Kaufman treatment kit level.,
Break the kit’s cards into sets.,
Read the cards aloud to the child.,
Ask the child to repeat the first syllable sounds on the cards.,
Reward the child after they complete each set of cards.,
Repeat the process.,
Ask the child to make the card sounds from memory.,
Offer a special reward after each successful set of cards.,
Upgrade to the advanced kit when the child is ready.",How to Use Kaufman Cards," To begin working with the Kaufman cards, you must know what kit level to use. That means understanding what vowels, consonants, and syllable shapes the child has already mastered. The Kaufman Speech Praxis Test for Children is often used to determine a child’s level.It’s best to have a speech therapist administer the test to the child to ensure that the results are accurate. A therapist may also have another method of testing for child that they prefer.;
, Once you understand what the child’s speech issues are, you can choose the appropriate card kit to help with their difficulties. There are two levels of Kaufman cards: basic and advanced. Each is geared toward addressing specific speech sounds to help the child develop functional, expressive language.The Kaufman Treatment Kit 1 is considered the basic level, and is geared toward children between the ages of 2 and 8. It targets the synthesis of basic sounds, such as /m, t, b, d, h, n, w, and p/.
The Kaufman Treatment Kit 2 is considered the advanced level, and is geared toward children between the ages of 4 and 10. It targets the synthesis of sounds such as /f, g, k, l, s, and sh/. It also blends /s, r, and l/ sounds.
If you’re choosing Kaufman cards to use at home, it’s best to consult with a speech therapist. Because they can evaluate your child’s speech difficulties, they will be best able to determine which Kaufman cards kit would work.

, The Kauman treatment kits contain between 250 and 285 cards each. You’ll overwhelm a child if you expect them to go through all of the cards in one sitting. Instead, separate the cards into smaller, more manageable sets of 10 to 20 cards that you can work with before taking a break.It’s best to start with smaller sets of cards until you know the amount that works best for the child.

, When you’re first introducing the Kaufman cards to the child, it’s best to start slow. Show them the card with the drawing of the object, and read the approximations of the word to the child. You don’t have to have them repeat the sounds at first; allow them to just make the association between the image and the word or sound.Each Kaufman card lists several approximations of the word depicted on it. They’re listed successively in order of difficulty, with the easiest sound being at the bottom of the list.
When you are first reading the cards to the child, you might simply read the full word and then the easiest approximation at the bottom of the list to avoid overwhelming them. You can move on to the other approximations in future sessions.

, After you’ve familiarized the child with the images on the cards and the words or sounds, it’s time for them to work on making the sounds themselves. Hold up the cards and read the easiest approximation of the word. Have the child repeat it to the best of their ability., The process can be frustrating for children so it’s important to keep them motivated. After the child works through a set of cards, give them a small reward and a break from the cards. Once they’ve enjoyed the reward, you can move onto the next set of cards.The reward should be simple, such as playing with a favorite toy or game.
Make sure that the child understands what the reward is before you begin working with the cards so they have it in their mind as motivation.

, With childhood apraxia of speech, a child may need up to 3000 productions of a sound combination or word to develop the muscle memory needed for that particular sound. That means you have to commit to using the cards with the child consistently and working on the same sound combinations and words until they master them.If you are using the cards at home, talk to your speech therapist about how often you should have your child work with them.
As you work through the cards, try to move along the speech approximations so the child gets closer to saying the actual word. Work slowly, though. You don’t want to frustrate the child by expecting them to do something that they’re not ready for.

, When the child can successfully repeat the actual word with your prompting, it’s time to work on spontaneous recall. Hold up the card, and have the child say the word or one of the approximations without you saying it first .This is often the most challenging part for children with speech difficulties. It’s important to be patient and allow the child time to recall the word or approximation.
If the child struggles with a certain words or approximation, repeat it for them. Set those cards aside, though, so you can single them out for extra work.

, Because spontaneous recall can be very difficult, it’s especially important to keep children motivated. After they complete each set of cards, you should give them a special reward. For example, instead of simply allowing them to play with a certain toy, you might allow them to go outside on the swings.Be sure to gear the reward toward the child. It’s important to know what their highly preferred activities are in order to devise the best way to reward them., Continue working with the child until they can recall all of the words on the cards. Once they are confident with the cards in the kit, you can move on to the advanced kit. If they are already working with the advanced kit, consult with a speech therapist to see what steps to take next.After the child completes the advanced Kaufman kit, completing the sessions without any cards or pictures is often the next step.

Fill out the forms.,
Mail in the form.,
Be sure to include all the relevant information.,
Wait for your request to be reviewed.",How to Modify Child Support," If either parent has a significant change in income, then you can request a modification., Though not permanent, a job loss creates a change in income. You can request a modification during this time period., It should be updated every few years to match the changing income of both parents, as well as the needs of the child.For instance, the Florida state government allows you to update every 3 years if no other significant change has taken place; Texas has the same stipulation, but it can vary by state., For instance, if you child becomes disabled or has health issues, you can ask for a modification., If one child is spending more time with one parent than before, that can be a reason to change the child support order., For instance, if one parent goes to jail or if a parent has a child in another relationship, those situations can both merit a change in the child support order., Because laws vary by state, the process will be different in each state. Child support is placed under different departments in different states, as well, so you may need to do some searching for your states.


For instance, in Arizona, child support is listed under the Arizona Department of Economic Security.In Texas, it's under the Attorney General of Texas., To be qualified to modify child support, your new support obligation must be higher or lower than the current obligation by a certain percentage. The percentage varies from state to state.


For example, if you live in Indiana, you can only modify support if you will have a 20% change in support.This guideline is referred to as the “20% rule.” So if your current obligation is $100 per week, you will need to show a $20 change because $20 is 20% of $100. Therefore, if your new obligation is less than $80 or more than $120, you have satisfied the 20% rule and are qualified to modify support.
To find your state’s rules regarding the percentage of change that must occur, review your state’s child support guidelines or laws, which you can find on Find Law's website., If the process confuses you, don't be afraid to ask for legal help. Most states have free legal help if you can't afford it on your own.


To find help, dial 211. The number is a nationwide service to assist you with what you need in your area.In some states, you may be able to come to and agreement with the other parent to change the support. You'll still need to notify the state, but it does make the process easier., Child support worksheets are used in every state to calculate the basic child support obligation of the non-custodial parent.You can find your state’s child support worksheets on the judicial website for your state. To find you state's website, follow the appropriate link under your state on the National Center for State Courts website., Follow the instructions on the worksheet or web page to complete a worksheet for your children. The worksheets may require you to have certain software. For instance, for Georgia's worksheets, you need to have Microsoft Excel 2007 or newer.You may need the following information when filling out the form:


Your gross monthly or weekly income, as well as the other parent's income. Gross income is your income before taxes or any other deductions are taken out of your pay.
Your child’s date of birth.
Your case number and case name. Your case name and number can be found at the top of any motion or order filed in your case. Case names follow the format “Jane Doe v. John Doe."" Case numbers may be called cause numbers, but are located at the top of court filings along with the parties names.
The amount your and your partner pay for health insurance for the child with documentation.
The amount either of you pay to support other children.

, If you determine you are eligible, move ahead to finding the child support modification or review forms. In most states, you can print off a form with instructions. In most cases, you'll need to print out the form and mail it in.In some states, such as Florida, you may need to contact the state. The state will send you the right form.Visit your county clerk’s office if you can't find the form online. Many clerk’s offices have forms for commonly filed motions and petitions available to anyone who stops in and asks.

, Following the instructions, fill out the forms with the required information. You will need similar information to what you used on the worksheet., As stated, you may be able to fill out the form online in some states. However, in others, you will need to mail them in, such as in both Arizona and Texas.In some instances, you may have to actually take the forms in. Also, you may need to pay a filing fee. However, all of that should be detailed in the instructions for your state.
In some states, you may need to attend a court hearing. However, in other states, your modification can be processed through the mail. For instance, in Alaska, you send in the form, and either the court or the Child Support Services Division will modify the order, depending on who ordered it in the first place.The same holds true in states such as Kansas,Arizona,, and Texas., For instance, in Arizona, you must include the return address on the envelope for it to be processed quickly., It takes some time for your case to be reviewed.


For instance, Arizona notes that it can take up to 6 months to gather the needed information and process the request."

Ask yourself whether the goals involve accommodation or assimilation.,
Consider if the therapist controls your loved one's affect.,
Consider whether the therapist is fighting or accommodating the autistic person's brain.A bad therapist may try in vain to make your loved one not be autistic; a good one will seek to work with them so they can grow into a happy and capable autistic adult.Therapists should focus on making a happy autistic child/adult, not a non-autistic one.,
Evaluate whether learning communication is treated as an essential skill, or a performance to please adults.",How to Tell if an Autism ABA Therapy Is Harmful1," The UN states that disabled children have a right to preservation of identity,i.e., to be themselves even if it means looking autistic. A good therapist will allow them to look different, and therapy will not center on removing characteristics such as...



Most stimming(You may hear phrases such as ""quiet hands"" and ""table ready"" to indicate suppression of stims.)
Toe-walking

Avoidance of eye contactDesire not to have a wide circle of friends
Other quirks (Fitting in should be a personal choice, not forced by others.);
, Some therapists train autistic people to show facial expressions or body language that suggest happiness, regardless of their actual feelings.No one should be pushed to smile or act happy if they do not feel happy.
Hugs and kisses should not be trained or pressured, even if it means hurting feelings. The right to set boundaries is important in arming your loved one against sexual and emotional abuse., Good therapy goals might include...


Finding comfortable and non-harmful stims, instead of extinguishing all stimming
Finding ways to accommodate and alleviate sensory issues
Gaining social skills in a friendly environment; these include assertiveness as well as making friends
Discussing and meeting your loved one's own personal goals

, Communication should be considered more important than verbal speech (including both behavior and AAC).Beginning vocabulary should focus on basic needs instead of parents' feelings.


Words such as ""yes,"" ""no,"" ""stop,"" ""hungry,"" and ""hurt"" are more necessary than ""I love you"" or ""Mommy.""
Behavior should be respected, even as someone is learning to communicate via AAC or speech.

"
Consider whether the therapist presumes competence.,
Evaluate whether the therapy is a team effort, or if it is therapist against autistic person.,
Take a close look at how boundaries are treated.,
Examine the use of reinforcers.,
Consider your loved one's ability to take a break to calm down or stim.,
Evaluate whether your loved one feels safe in therapy.,
See whether the therapist cares about the autistic person's emotions.,
Consider how the therapist reacts if your loved one cries or gets upset.,
Watch for physical intervention.,
Be wary if your loved one appears to be regressing or becoming fearful.,
Consider whether you would be okay with a non-autistic person being treated this way.",How to Tell if an Autism ABA Therapy Is Harmful2," A good therapist will always assume that the loved one is capable of listening (even if they seem unresponsive), and will assume that they are doing their best.A nonverbal or partially verbal loved one may be able to think more deeply than they can communicate.Their body may not always obey them, so they may not be able to accurately point to the things they want to point to.The therapist should care about why your loved one does what they do, and never assume that a behavior is meaningless, nor should they choose to ignore what the autistic person might be trying to communicate.Schoolwork designed for a four-year-old is not appropriate for a sixteen-year-old.

, Consent matters. A good therapist will try to work with your loved one and respectfully engage with them on their level. Therapy should not be a battle, and autistic people should not have to suffer through it.Think if it would be better described as cooperation or as compliance.Your loved one should be able to voice concerns, opinions, and goals. They should have input in their own treatment.
A therapist needs to honor a ""no."" If your loved one is ignored when they say ""no,"" they learn that the word ""no"" is not important and they do not need to listen to it.Find a fun therapy for your loved one if you can. Many good therapies feel like structured playtime.

, Your loved one should be able to say no, and have the therapist listen to them. The therapist should not push, pressure, coerce, or threaten loss of tokens or privileges if the autistic person is not comfortable with something.Your loved one should be taken seriously when they say no or express discomfort (verbally or not).
Bullying and sexual abuse rates are high in autistic children (and adults). Consider asking that assertiveness training be part of your loved one's therapy program., Reinforcers can be effective, but can also be overusedor abused.A bad therapist may tell you to deny your loved one access to their favorite things at home, in order to make them work for them in therapy.Take note if the therapist uses or restricts...


Food
Access to things they love, such as their special interest or their teddy bearNegative reinforcers, aka ""aversives"" or corporal punishment (e.g. slapping, squirting vinegar in the mouth, forced inhalation of ammonia, electric shocks)Ability to take breaks
Too many reinforcers; the autistic person's life is a series of tokens and exchanges, or they are losing internal motivation

, A bad therapy may push an autistic person long after they need a break, and even use this as a technique to break their will so that they comply. A good therapy allows plenty of breaks as needed.40 hours per week of therapy is as demanding as a full-time job. This can be exhausting, especially for young children.
A good therapist will encourage your loved one to communicate the need for a break, and allow a break whenever the autistic person or the therapist thinks one is needed.

, Good therapy will help autistic people feel relaxed and safe.If it involves regular screaming, sobbing, or battles of wills, then it isn't going well.Bad days do happen, and your loved one may cry in therapy. If this happens, consider what role the therapist played in the cause of distress, and how they responded.

, Therapies such as ABA focus on the ABC model—antecedent, behavior, consequence. While this clearly has its uses, it can become dangerous if internal experiences (such as emotions and stress) are ignored.A good therapist will empathize with your loved one and try to see the world through their perspective.A good therapist will be careful not to push your loved one too hard, and will give them a break if they need it.
A bad therapist will not stop if they are causing distress, or may push even harder., A good therapist will immediately de-escalate and show concern (or remorse) over the situation. A bad one may press harder, pin them down, or try to ""break"" the autistic person, turning it into a battle of the wills.


A good therapist will be honest about what happened, and take steps to prevent it from happening again. They care about your loved one's emotional pain.
Some bad therapists explain these as ""tantrums"" and insist that these must be dealt with harshly.
Too many weeks, months, or years of tears and frustration may lead previously nonviolent children to become aggressive., Some therapists will physically force compliance if an autistic person does not do what they want. Look for...


AversivesGrabbing and moving the person against their will (including hand-over-hand on an unwilling person)Forced restraint (slapping hands onto table, pinning them against the floor instead of de-escalating)Trapping them (""calm down"" rooms with locked doors, chairs with straps to hold them down)

, A harmful therapy may place severe stress on your loved one, causing autistic burnout or abuse symptoms. Your loved one may act ""like a different person"" during therapy or with people involved with therapy, or even all the time.Watch for...Increased meltdowns
Heightened anxiety; decreased trust of adults
Loss of skills
Extreme behavior: demanding, aggressive, extremely compliant, withdrawn, listlessSuicidal thoughtsIncreased distress before, during, or after therapyViolence, if it was never a serious problem beforeOther changes in mood, skill, or behaviorThe source of this may not be the therapy. However, if the therapist brushes off concerns, and/or your loved one appears especially anxious about the therapy or therapist, this is a red flag., No one is ""too low-functioning"" to be treated well, and it can help to visualize a non-autistic child being treated like your loved one is being treated. Take a minute to imagine it. Does this make you uncomfortable?Would you flinch or intervene if you saw a non-autistic sibling or peer being treated this way?
Imagine yourself being the autistic person's age. Would it feel demeaning if you went through this?
If a parent treated a non-autistic child this way, would you be calling Child Protective Services?

"
"
Be wary of false promises.,
Notice how the therapist talks about autism and your loved one.,
Consider whether the therapist allows you to witness sessions at all.,
Ask if the therapist listens to your concerns.,
Trust your gut.",How to Tell if an Autism ABA Therapy Is Harmful3," A bad therapist may be dishonest with you, manipulate you, or make promises that they do not deliver on. They may wave off concerns, blame you, or blame your loved one if things do not go as they say. Look for these issues:



Autism is lifelong.Your loved one cannot be ""cured"" of autism.

Autistic people are very diverse.A one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to meet your loved one's individual needs.

Other good therapies do exist. If a therapy claims that it is the ""chemotherapy of autism,"" or that all other therapies are bogus, your therapist is not being honest.

ABA teaches some tasks better than others. It can be useful to teach physical skills like getting dressed or tapping shoulders to get someone's attention. Since it is data-driven, it does not work as well for teaching speech or skills involving a mind-body disconnect (e.g. trying to point to the correct card).Autistic people have real emotions. If your loved one is acting scared or in pain, they probably are.

Autism and happiness aren't mutually exclusive. Your loved one can live a happy life and be autistic at the same time.

, Even if your loved one is nonverbal and appears unresponsive, they can pick up on the therapist's words or attitude. A highly negative attitude can hurt an autistic person's self-esteem, and may also suggest that the therapist is mistreating them.


Calling autism a tragedy, horrible burden, life-destroying monster, etc.
Calling your loved one ""manipulative"" or blaming them for any issues that arise.Urging you to punish the loved one more harshly, If the therapist is hurting your loved one (emotionally or physically), they may try to keep you from finding out.


The therapist may tell you that your presence would be a distraction, or that you would interfere. This is a serious red flag.If you are not allowed to see the sessions, but the therapist reports back, be aware that there is a possibility that they are distorting the truth or using sweet euphemisms for ugly things.

, As a parent, caregiver, or loved one, your instincts matter.You can usually tell when something is wrong for your loved one. A good therapist will listen to any doubts and take them seriously, while a bad one may act defensive, wave them off, or pull rank.


A bad therapist might tell you not to trust your judgment. This is an enormous red flag. They may be an expert, but that does not mean that your thoughts mean nothing.
If you voice lasting disagreement, a bad therapist may try to turn other people against you.

, If you're getting a niggling feeling that something isn't right, then that is an important feeling worth exploring. If it seems wrong, don't be afraid to walk away. There are other therapists, both in ABA and other therapies. Don't settle for anything less than your loved one's happiness.

Seek a therapist experienced with working with children and families around issues of conduct disorder. A comprehensive therapist may gather information from the parents, child, and family, in addition to information from the school, community, and the legal system (if applicable).Strategies for addressing conduct disorder often involve implementing cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) and parent education/training.Look for a therapist who will work with parents and the whole family.
For more information, check out How to Diagnose Conduct Disorder.;
, If a child presents with substance abuse, treat the substance abuse first before treating the conduct disorder.Behavior and psychological treatment will likely be less effective when it’s done with the presence of substance abuse.


Be aware of any cigarette use, cannabis use, prescription drug use, or the use of hard drugs.
Depending on severity, substance abuse can be treated with therapy or through residential treatment/detox. For more information, check out How to Find Substance Abuse Treatment.

, It’s likely that a child with CD may have other mental health problems as well, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some may develop PTSD as a result of violence in the home. A child may witness violence from one parent to the other, from a parent to a sibling, or may experience violence from the parent to the self. These events can be quite damaging, and may leave a lasting impact on the child. For treatment to be effective, it’s important to address any co-occurring disorders.A child or adolescent may also suffer from depression, anxiety, or another psychological diagnosis that impacts mood and functioning. Talk to your therapist about identifying symptoms.
For more information, check out How to Treat PTSD and How to Treat ADHD.

, While medication appears to be ineffective at treating conduct disorder, medication may be beneficial for treating co-occurring disorders such as ADHD, depression, or anxiety. It is best to talk to a psychiatrist prior to obtaining medication for psychological treatment. A psychiatrist will monitor symptoms, side-effects, and the course of medication.Medications are not a full treatment and often include side-effects. Medication helps to cope with symptoms, not fully treat a disorder. Therapy is often most beneficial, and medications can accompany treatment in tandem.
If obtaining medication, seek a psychiatrist whom you trust to talk to about your moods, symptoms, medication, and overall well-being.

, Generally, outcomes for treating CD are poor when parents are not involved in treatment.It’s important for parents to remain committed to treatment for their child. Commit to regular appointments, show up on time, and follow through with any assignments the therapist asks you to do between sessions.


Because parental involvement is so important, find a therapist who has evening hours and have childcare set up if needed. Choose a therapist whom you feel aligned with and your child feels comfortable talking to.

, Therapists will include parents in treatment and sometimes require sessions with just the parents. Parent education may include learning which problems to ignore and which to address, giving children clear and not vague instructions for behavior, and teaching communication skills and conflict resolution skills.A therapist may involve you in “homework” to work on skills at home or have you practice interactions with your child. Follow through on these tasks.

, Parents may feel like a failure or feel like they have let their child down. Parents may feel hopeless or helpless in dealing with the child’s behavior. Some parents may feel like they have created the problem for their child, or they may blame the child harshly for the child’s behavior. It’s important to remove blame and find better ways to handle the difficult situations.Parents can learn through modeling or role playing how to more effectively monitor their child’s behavior and supervise their child.
A therapist can help you work through feelings of blame toward yourself or toward your child.

, Many parents struggle to provide consistent parenting to the child with CD. This can include difficulty providing a supportive and nurturing environment, inconsistent discipline, and overly-relying on punishment to address bad behaviors.Without placing blame on the child, family, or parents, therapy will help build more consistent patterns for the family.


This may include creating a schedule for the day for all children, keeping consequences, rewards, and punishments clear-cut, and encouraging the parents to act with compassion toward their children, even when the children are difficult.

, For children ages 3-12, treatment is different than from adolescents. Treatment is focused on play, bonding with the child, developing a positive and consistent parent-child relationship, using praise and rewards to encourage positive behaviors, reorganizing the child’s day to reduce or prevent problems, giving clear directions and expectations of the child, and using clear and consistent consequences in a calm manner.For adolescents, a great deal of family work occurs in treatment. Skills such as functional communication between parents and teens are learned, practiced, and monitored. Parents and teens learn to communicate emotions and needs in a more adaptive way., Parents and children may discuss the situations which are most difficult for them. One by one, the therapist can help the family create a behavior plan for each behavior. These behavior plans help both the parent and the child to respond more beneficially in these instances. The plan clearly states what behaviors are ‘target’ (desired or undesired) behaviors and what changes are required. Consequences, as well as preferred behaviors, are expressed. Behavior plans allow children a predictable way to handle situations and allow parents a consistent way to enforce consequences.For example, one item may be disrespectful behavior. These may include talking back, swearing at a parent, mumbling under the child’s breath, rolling eyes, etc. The consequences for these behaviors may include taking away internet privileges, enforcing an earlier bedtime, or adding chores. Having predictability for the child and the parents can help both to handle the situation more effectively.

, Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) assumes that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are intimately connected and influence each other. Maladaptive or ‘bad’ behaviors are seen as learned in response to a perceived reward or consequence. With this in mind, therapists believe that maladaptive behaviors can be “unlearned” and replaced with more positive, prosocial behaviors through navigating new rewards and consequences.For example, a child may want attention and may not know how to go about getting positive attention. The therapist can work with the behaviors and show the child that he or she can receive attention from parents in a positive way and that the outcomes are more positive for the parents and the child.
Some common goals of therapy for children include reducing aggression (shouting, kicking, hitting), increasing prosocial behaviors (interacting well with peers, engaging in conversations), correcting distorted thoughts and inaccurate self-evaluations (such as “everyone is out to get me” or “I’m no good at anything”), and addressing self-control and emotional stability., Thoughts are an important consideration to address, as thoughts can motivate behaviors. If a child has a negative, overgeneralized, or exaggerated understanding of a situation, this can lead to negative behavior. Therapy aims to target these false or maladaptive beliefs and replace them with positive, adaptive beliefs.For instance, a child may believe, “All people are against me and I must always react defensively.” The therapist may challenge this belief and encourage the child to replace the belief with something like, “There are many people who care about me and want what’s best for me. Even if I don’t consider it what’s best for me, I know their actions are motivated by caring for me.”

, A therapist can work with a child to reframe stressful events. This can be especially beneficial for treating anger. For many children with CD, anger tends to be the first line of defense. A therapist can help the child to diffuse the anger response by practicing relaxation techniques (such as deep breathing) and taking a moment to reframe the situation before it gets out of hand.For example, a child may instantly respond in anger when told a command, such as “do your work and stop being distracted.” A therapist can help bring awareness to the anger (by increasing self-awareness in the body) and allow the child to find alternative ways to interpret the situation. Instead of feeling threatened by the command or angry that the child is being singled out, the child can learn to self-monitor and think, “I’m not focused right now, and this person is trying to help me.”

, A layered or multisystemic treatment of conduct disorder includes working with the family, peers, neighborhood, and school to approach the behaviors as being linked to various sources.


For instance, peers may contribute to encouraging bad behavior or schools may have ineffective consequences for handling bad behavior.
The goals of this kind of approach are to encourage the child to disengage from deviant peers, build stronger bonds at home and at school, to enhance family skills, and to achieve greater social and academic competence., Treating a child with CD can be difficult on everyone involved. Stay hopeful and continue with treatment. Treating conduct disorder is a long-term commitment, so don’t expect to see radical changes right away. Above all, remember to see and praise the positive aspects in the child. It is possible to recover from CD.

,, Having trouble might indicate a learning disability.


Ask younger children to recite the alphabet. Once a child has it memorized, he should be able to say it consistently all the time.
Quiz older children on adding skills or multiplication tables. Making mistakes on math problems she has answered correctly in the past might indicate a learning disability.

,, Such behavior might be due to a learning disability.

Tell them soon.,
Choose a good time to talk to your child.,
Approach your child and gently introduce the conversation.,
Be positive and straightforward while giving them this news.,
Explain autism.,
Ask if they have any questions.,
Help your child learn what autism means to them.,
Be prepared for more questions later.,
Support your child!",How to Tell a Child They Are Autistic," Some parents avoid telling their children about their autism because they don't want their child to feel different. However, hiding the word will not stop this. If your child is around other children, then they already can tell that they aren't like everyone else.If you explain autism, you can give them an explanation for this, and make it clear that this isn't their fault and they aren't bad or wrong.
, This conversation will have a big impact on your child's life, so it carries quite a bit of emotion in and of itself. Find a time when your child is calm, content, and not busy. A good time might be after they've come home from school, finished their homework, and had a snack. If issues such as hunger, thirst, stress, and restlessness are on the child's mind, they might not be able to process this new piece of information well.

Give them some time think about it; don't tell them just before school or bedtime, as it may occupy their minds in class or when they're trying to sleep.

, Use any of the following ideas ideas, and add in things that you think your child will be receptive to. Some possible conversation starters include:

""Would you like to hear the results of the tests with Dr. Smith?""
""I have something important to talk to you about.""
""I want to tell you what your teachers have found out about you.""

, Autism does not have to be a bad thing, and your attitude about it will influence how your child feels about themself. Even if your child seems unemotional about it, they could be in emotional turmoil on the inside.


Do not say that you're sorry or present it as a tragic or sad situation. Autism is part of who your child is, and if you're negative about it, then the child will begin to feel guilt, resentment, even hatred in regards to their autism. Being autistic in a non-autistic world is hard in and of itself. Don't make the label yet another burden for your child to bear,

, Be sure to emphasize that it's natural and they were born with it, just like they were born with blue eyes or black hair. Explain it in terms of their experiences, so that they understand how it affects them, and let them know they aren't alone. Describe how around 1% of the population is thought to be autistic, including many geniuses and very successful people, such as Bill Gates and Albert Einstein, are speculated to be or have been autistic as well.

Mention the good parts as well as the hard parts. This will help your child recognize that it isn't a tragedy.
For example, ""Autism is why you didn't learn to speak until you were older, and why it can be hard for you to understand other kids sometimes. It's also why you're so passionate about drawing and good at recognizing patterns in math.""
Make it clear that different isn't bad. When you tell your child they're autistic, make sure to emphasize their strengths, and explain that just because they aren't like their classmates doesn't mean that they're bad or that they did something wrong.

, This is a lot for a child to take in, and if they are particularly young, they might not know anything about autism. Whether they ask anything or not, don't worry. You can have more than one conversation about autism, so the first one doesn't need to cover everything., Your child needs to learn and understand autism on their own terms. Help them get involved with autistic culture. If your child wants to ask you questions directly, learn about autism on your own and admit when you need to look up something. If your child likes other learning methods like podcasts, comics, videos, or anything else, search the web for appropriate information. Here are some useful things they can read:

, Since it takes time to process, your child may need some time to think, and may come back days or weeks later with new questions. Accept and encourage curiosity, and tell them the answers or look for answers together., This is the most important part. Remember that your child's world is shaped by autism, and look for ways to help make it easier. Remind yourself and your child that people don't suffer from autism, they only suffer from people who don't understand autism. With family and friends who try their best to understand autism, it is just another way of looking at the world that is no worse than anyone else's way. Your positive support of your child can make all the difference in helping them to cope with the diagnosis and thrive in life."

Visit your pediatrician.,
Give your child an Intelligence (IQ) test.,
Ask the school to administer a standardized achievement test.,
Compare the test scores.,
Talk to your doctor about other tests you might want to have done.,
Find out how your state identifies a learning disability.",How to Tell If Your Child Has a Learning Disability2," If you have identified symptoms that may indicate a learning disorder, talk to your doctor.


Rule out medical reasons for learning problems, such as poor vision or hearing.

, In order to have a learning disability, your child must test as being of average or above average intelligence.

, This might be on reading, writing, math or a combination of all 3 subjects.

, A learning disability can be established when there is a large difference between the IQ score and the standardized test score.


Understand how this comparison works. The IQ test identifies your child's potential while the standardized test measures your child's actual achievement. Therefore, if your child tests 115 on the IQ test, but only 95 on the standardized test, there is a gap of 20 points between potential and achievement. This indicates a learning disability.

, There are neurological, psychological and emotional tests that can be taken to help you and your doctor identify any issues and decide on a good course of treatment.

, Most states will require a discrepancy in test scores of about 15 points.


Talk to your school district about whether your child's learning disability will permit him to get extra help in school.
Talk to your school about how to help your child if no learning disability is diagnosed. There may be other reasons for why your child is not performing at the level he or she should be.

Look for childcare.,
Enroll in programs to pay for childcare.,
Enroll them in pre-K.,
Find a local babysitter.",How to Care for a Child While Attending College1," Before you begin school, research daycares close to your apartment/house and the University. You will want to enroll your child in a daycare that will be easily accessible for you should you be in a rush in the morning or if your child should become ill and you need to leave class to pick them up. In addition to proximity, consider cost, reviews, as well as all of the amenities of that particular daycare. For instance, some daycares have cameras that you can login to so that you can check on your child virtually throughout the day.
Some daycares have a religious curriculum and others do different educational activities.;
, One of your major concerns about daycare is likely the cost. However, there are many programs available either through your school or through the government that will provide you with daycare assistance. Contact your local Department of Health and Human Services as well as Parent and Family Services Office at your school to see what aid can be offered to you.Enlist the help of the child’s mother or father as well to help assist you in paying for daycare.

, In addition to daycare, there are also many free childcare programs like Head Start or pre-K that you can enroll your child in if they are age 3-4 or older, depending upon the state and available slots. Look into these programs in your area if your child is of age.

, In addition to relying on family, friends, and daycare, try to find a local and reliable babysitter that you can use in times of emergency or when planning a night out with friends. You can search for them on Care.com or SitterCity."

Go to a University that provides childcare.,
Choose more online classes.,
Talk to your professors.,
Meet with your advisor to create a reasonable class schedule.,
Do independent studying.",How to Care for a Child While Attending College2," In addition to providing monies for daycare services, there are some colleges that go above and beyond by providing free on campus daycare for students. If possible, find a college in your area that will provide this as this is the most convenient form of childcare., In addition to childcare, be sure to select classes that will provide you with some flexibility. Many professors post their lectures online and can potentially exempt you from physically being in class if you check with them. Other classes are online exclusively.Make sure that you are still taking the classes that align with your major and field of interest, however, even if they are not online.
Be sure to know the tardiness and absentee policy. Many professors will excuse up to three absences per semester, but no more.

, Before your classes begin, email or meet your professors and explain your situation. Tell them that you have a child and may need to stay out of class with them occasionally if they are sick. Avoid making any promises that you can’t keep, like saying that you will complete every assignment on time, as you cannot predict the future and never know what will come up. Say something like “Hi Professor Richardson, I will be taking your Economics class this Fall and before classes begin, I wanted to let you know that I have a child. While I plan to always be in class, I also know that sometimes my child gets sick and I will have to stay home with him. I just wanted to let you know beforehand so you know that I’m serious about your class.”
Be sure to be early and prepared for class as much as possible to make up for the times when you will need to be absent.

, You may need to space your classes out or have them in a certain location in order to facilitate nursing your baby or accommodating your child’s schedule in general. Also, make sure that you are not overloaded and try to start off small. Start with taking a small courseload of no more than 4 classes or twelve credit hours.Avoid night classes when possible.

, If you're a first year, there are usually certain classes you are required to take during the first semester. If these classes are on opposite ends of the campus or at odd times and it will cause you a lot of anxiety to juggle the classes and a child, talk to the head of department for the class and see if you can form a curriculum for you to do the work independently. Many campuses often this level of flexibility, and even if they don’t, at least you will know that you tried.

"
"
Set a routine.,
Find appropriate housing.,
Sleep when your baby sleeps.,
Study whenever and wherever you can.",How to Care for a Child While Attending College3," During this time of both caring for your child and managing your work as a student, be sure to set a schedule for yourself. This will help ensure that both you and your baby are adjusted to the college life. Plan for a set time each day to study, exercise, eat, sleep, go to class, and to drop off/pick up your child., Many universities offer housing options for families or students with children, as you cannot live in a dorm room with a baby. Look into these options at your school. In addition, if you prefer to live off campus, you can find some apartments nearby that are in your price range and are kid friendly.

, Though it can be tempting to clean or work while your baby is sleeping, this can be damaging to your health. When your baby sleeps, you should sleep as well. You do not need as much sleep as your child does, so get the seven or eight hours that you need, and then get up and do whatever work you need to do.If you don’t sleep when the baby does, you might find yourself pulling an unwanted all-nighter, as your child might stay up through the night leaving you having gotten no sleep.

, Make the most of every moment that you have away from your child. Study on the bus or in between your classes or during any spare moment you get during the day. Even 5-10 minutes can make the difference between passing a test or failing."
"
Take your child to class.,
Care for their basic needs.,
Schedule time each day to spend with them.",How to Care for a Child While Attending College4," If your child is generally well behaved, then you can also consider bringing them to class with you. If you do so, be sure to speak to your professor beforehand. Bring them enough snacks, books, and activities to keep them entertained.


You might also consider packing your iPad and headphones for them to watch a movie or show on.

, Ensure that your child is well fed throughout the day, is going to bed early enough each night, and is bathed each day and dressed in clean clothes. Though children need much more than this in order to flourish, they cannot develop unless their basic needs are met.If your child is old enough to have table food, feed them healthy fruits and vegetables.

, Beyond just feeding, clothing and putting your child to sleep, be sure to spend some quality time together each day. Some days, you will be very busy and perhaps only have time to read them a story at night. This quality time is better than no time at all, but try to spend at least 30 minutes to an hour daily just relaxing or engaging with your child.Try to keep your phone out of your hands during this time. Give your baby you full attention.
You might also choose to play with them, watch a show or take them out for ice cream.

Get help.,
Meet other student parents.,
Keep company.,
Take care of yourself, too.",How to Care for a Child While Attending College5," Your friends and family can be vitally important to you during this time. If you are living away from home, you may want to transfer to a college where you can live with or near family. If you have a partner, make sure that they do their share to care for the child, especially if it is their own.If you develop a close relationship while in college with a new friend, see if they can watch your baby every so often. Try to make it only once a month or so so you don’t exhaust them.

, Find out if there are any clubs for student mothers or fathers on your campus. Get to know people in your class and find out if they have children. You will be able to relate to them much better than to your other peers who don’t know what it’s like to be a student and a parent. Spend time studying with them or even taking turns watching each other’s kids so you can have a night to study or do work., Avoid becoming isolated. If you're taking a walk with the baby, invite someone to come with you. Be social whenever you can and continue to develop and maintain your friendships. You do not want to get so caught up in your baby that you forget to have a life outside of being a mother or father.

, Just as your child is important, you are important, as well. Your baby cannot be well cared for if you are not taking care of yourself. Each day, be sure to eat three healthy meals, try to work out at least every other day, and be sure to take care of your hygiene. When possible, treat yourself to a new outfit and even a vacation occasionally."

, They are people; not your person. They are under your care, but they don't belong to you. They are themselves.

, It really helps a child to know how fortunate they are. Take them with you and show them your own history. Make them part of your normal life, not add-ons. They may be interested in your hobbies and this way you can bond.

, Plan for a favorite activity such as going out to dinner or ice cream. Make sure you pay close attention to them; this is bonding, not babysitting.

, Really listen. It may be nonsense, if they are young, but that's fine. Steer their ideas into reasonable ways.

, Read good books to them, take them to a museum or ball game, introduce them to new hobbies. Have fun with them while teaching. That means you must have fun too. This is not a chore, but a life choice.

Let them know you're thinking of them.",How to Be Friends with Your Kid," Spending time together doesn't always ""just happen;"" it takes effort to make it a daily activity. During this time, you can give your child your full attention, allowing them to open up to you. Here are some times you can spend together:


Driving to and from school/activities
Dinnertime
10-minute chat after school
Bedtime routine;
, Active, nonjudgmental listening will help your child feel that they can tell you anything. Work on trying to understand what your child thinks and feels, without immediately turning it into a lesson or a lecture. Here are some examples of good phrasing.


""Would you like to tell me about your day?""
""What happened next?""
""I'm sorry to hear that happened to you.""
""So you're feeling upset because you forgot to do the homework that was due today.""

, It's good to ask questions (""How did your physics class go?""), but it's also important to respect your child's boundaries. If they don't want to talk about it, don't keep pressing. Letting them know that you respect them is key to making them trust you and be willing to talk more.


""So, did you want to tell me about that party last night?""
""I'm sorry, I'm talking over you, aren't I? Please continue.""
""If you don't want to tell me about it, you don't have to. You choose."" (Many times, a statement like this will make the child feel understood, and they will then say what was on their mind.)

, Try to be patient when they make mistakes, remembering that they learn social interaction skills from you. (If you yell at them, they'll yell at other people.) It is absolutely fine to be firm when you need to be, but shouting will only scare them.


Give clear alternatives to catch misbehavior before it becomes a problem. (""Walking feet in the house, please. If you want to run around, go to the backyard."")
Punishments and raised voices should only come from your child continuously disobeying you.

, Some parents try to change their children's identity, but this only serves to isolate and upset the child. Don't try to push them out of their clothing preferences, disability symptoms, gender identity, sexual orientation, or favorite toys/activities.


If you're worried about bullying, tell the child. ""Sometimes people say mean things when they see a boy wearing girly shirts. It's not fair, but it does happen. You get to make the choice what shirts you wear, and I will support you whatever you decide.""
If your child is LGBT+ or developmentally disabled, read what similar adults have to say. They can offer guidance on how to accept and help your child.

, Your child looks up to you as a smart and wise adult, and they will love it if you shower attention on them by teaching them. Read books together, teach them about your interests (assuming they are interested too), demonstrate social skills, and share new learning opportunities.

, If your son loves to paint, buy him some watercolors, and maybe sit and paint or draw together. If your daughter is fascinated with engineering, play on the floor with engineering toys that involve gears and wheels.

, This will give the two of you the opportunity to catch up with each other and make memories together. Try movies, nature trails, playgrounds, beaches, skating rinks, sports games, and whatever you and your child enjoy.

, This is especially important if you are a busy person. When they add up, the little things can make a big difference.

Read through the manual that came with the car seat thoroughly to ensure you understand how to install the car seat for your model of car.,
Install the car seat into the back seat of your car if you have two rows of seats.,
Kneel on the seat and tighten the seat belt and the LATCH tethers.,
Have the seat inspected by a professional.",How to Buckle Up a Small Child1," Also read age, weight and height requirements for the car seat to be sure your child fits within the seat's parameters.;
, If possible, put the car seat in the middle of the back seat, which will protect your child in case of a side-impact accident.


If your vehicle has three rows of seats, such as a mini-van or an SUV, install the seat in the middle of the middle seat, which is the safest place in these vehicles. When you're installing the car seat, be sure you follow the steps in the manual carefully.

, You can also try using something heavy, such as hand weights, to weigh the seat down. You can also get help from a friend or spouse while you adjust the fasteners. By putting weight on the seat, you'll weigh the seat down allowing you to get a tighter fit for the car seat so it's more secure.

, If you're concerned with whether you installed the car seat correctly, the next step is to take it to a professional for inspection. These inspections are typically free.


You can find a trained car seat inspector online or by calling 1-866-SEAT-CHECK. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration web site also has information.

Listen carefully.,
Use positive words.,
Speak to kids, not at them.,
Consider their opinions.,
Be aware of your body language.",How to Be Good With Young Children1," If you are looking to bond with a child, start by paying attention when they speak. Kids are just finding their voices, and what they are saying is very important to them. Actively listen when a young child is speaking to you.One way to demonstrate that you are listening is to make eye contact. You can also physically indicate that you are paying attention by bending down so that you and the child are on the same level.
Ask questions as the child is talking. This will let him know that you are interested and engaged in the conversation.;
, Kids need reassurance. When you are having a conversation with a child, try to keep both your words and your tone of voice positive. Avoid sounding judgmental. Try to make them feel like they are a valuable contributor to your conversation.Use more ""do"" words than ""don't"" words. For example, say ""I like it when you hold my hand crossing the street"" instead of, ""Don't cross the street without holding my hand."" The first sentence will sound more positive and reassuring to a child.
Use phrases that will give the child permission to elaborate. Try saying things such as, ""Tell me more."" Or, ""That's interesting! Why is that?""

, Much like adults, kids do not respond well if you speak in a condescending tone. Try to give a child the same consideration and respect that you would give a friend. Make kids an active part of the conversation, instead of talking at them.For example, don't talk about children as though they are not there. Speak directly to them. Instead of saying to your friend, ""Wow, Kevin seems upset!"", try saying directly to the child, ""Kevin, you seem upset. Can I help you with something?""

, A great way to make a child feel valued is to ask for their opinion. You can definitely guide their choices by providing them with limited options, but by offering choices, you are showing respect. You can also ask a child how they feel about certain activities, or ask them about their day.Try offering choices, such as ""Sam, would you like carrots or celery with your lunch?"". You could also say, ""Sue, would you rather play Go Fish or Crazy Eights?""

, Children pick up on physical cues. Notice what your body language is saying. For example, many people lose patience when talking to children. If that happens to you, avoid letting it show in your body language. Avoid rolling your eyes or shaking your head.


Smile a lot. This will make the child feel more comfortable and safe.

"
"
Use your imagination.,
Read books.,
Listen to music.,
Play games.,
Take a field trip.",How to Be Good With Young Children2," Finding a fun activity is a great way to bond with a child. Let the child's imagination be your guide. Ask them what type of adventure they would like to have. Then imagine that you are off on an adventure to the moon. For example, you could build a ""spaceship"" out of a cardboard box and take an amazing journey.Kids love to play pretend. Be willing to participate in the games they come up with. They might want to pretend they are at ""work"" or playing in a major league baseball game. Being imaginative with kids is fun for both of you.

, Having story time is a way for kids to both have fun and learn. Try reading out loud to small children. Enhance the story by including some funny voices or other sound effects.If the child is learning (or knows how) to read, have them alternate pages with you as you read aloud. This will make reading more of a team activity.

, Music is an important part of a child's development, and it is also a lot of fun. Try singing songs with kids. Songs that have easy melodies and a repeating chorus are great choices.If you have any musical instruments handy, let the child take a turn playing them. Kids love to try out the keys on the piano, and they especially love to bang on drums.

, Games are a great way for you and the child with to be active together. You can play games that have set rules (think easy board games or card games) or you and the child can invent a game together. Whichever game you choose, make sure to congratulate the child when he does well.Games can also be great teaching tools. Try looking for ones that teach skills like counting for younger kids. If the child is older, there are many great ""brain teaser"" games that you can purchase.

, Kids love to go new places. For them, almost anywhere new can be an adventure. If you have the opportunity, take her to a nearby children's museum. There will be lots of interactive exhibits that will be a lot of fun for both of you.If you don't have access to museums or other attractions, you can make going to the neighborhood playground seem like a special trip. Be enthusiastic, and when you get to the park, be willing to play!

Notice their reactions.,
Pay attention to their activity level.,
Spend time together.,
Build their self-esteem.",How to Be Good With Young Children3," When interacting with kids, it is important to be aware that they sometimes do not express their feelings with clear words. Instead, try to watch their reactions during conversations or activities. There are important indicators that will let you know how a kid feels about something. Remember that different kids will have different reactions to stimuli. Some children will need (or want) more attention, others will require (or want) less.
Pay attention to facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice to gauge how a child is reacting to something.

, Kids don't have the same schedule as adults. They are more prone to short bursts of intense activity with longer periods of rest. Being aware of whether she seems tired or bored is an important way to help a child feel comfortable around you.If a child is more active, follow their lead and participate in their play. If a child is quieter, try to entice them with your own ideas.

, Quality time is one of the best ways that you can make a positive influence on a child. It is an important way get to know one another, and to enhance your relationship. Make it a point to spend time doing activities that the child will enjoy.


Ideas for quality time include listening to music, readings books, and playing games.

, Kids are in the process of developing their personalities. Your positive reassurance is one of the best ways to increase their confidence and help them to grow. Offer him positive words and encouragement during a variety of activities.If you are singing a song, tell her how much fun you are having. If you play a game and she wins, tell her she did a great job. Positive reinforcement is important, and really easy to offer.

Be sure your child knows that you love them.,
Talk to your child.,
Remember that this is just who your child is, and whether you believe they were born like that or not, you still want your child to feel comfortable enough to feel that they can be true to themselves around you.,
Make an effort to learn about sexuality.,
Try to accept your child.,
Become an advocate to family and friends.,
Be calm.,
Ask your child what their sexuality means to them.",How to Accept That Your Child is Homosexual or Bisexual," They've faced struggles too and suffered from internal turmoil—don't make them feel any worse. Imagine their internal struggle when these confusing feelings arose.;
, Be proud that they trusted you enough to tell you. Today's society is not always accepting. Have an open dialogue where you can both ask questions and share concerns. Remember, your child probably feels a little confused and very nervous also. Focus on being non-judgmental, rather than accusatory, even if the subject makes you uncomfortable. The most reassuring thing you can say is,""I love you, and I am proud of you for telling me.""

, It's part of their identity, just like their freckles or their laugh. They haven't changed—they're the same person they were yesterday.

, You will be able to better understand your child's thoughts and feelings. This will also give you something to talk about. Maybe you can try catching up with LGBT+ news and pop culture.

, If you have trouble accepting your child's sexuality, consider joining a group geared towards parents where you can talk to your peers about your feelings. Talking to a counselor is another option.


Remember that many LGBT+ stereotypes are untrue. Bisexual or homosexual people are not necessarily more promiscuous than heterosexual people, nor are they any more likely to be pedophiles or rapists.
Ask yourself: if somebody is gay or bisexual, whom are they hurting? Is a consenting relationship causing any actual harm?
Consider what your prejudices (if any) might reflect upon yourself. Why do you feel the way you do? Are you projecting your own fears or hatred onto others?

, If you present your child with shame or belittle them, your family may echo your attitude. Foster acceptance by showing your family and friends you respect and understand your child. Even acting like you accept something can be a positive step toward opening your mind and true acceptance.

, Don't get angry or tell them that what they have ""decided/accepted"" is wrong or suggest that it's just a phase and will go away. Remember that your child may be frightened to tell you, or get the feeling that you would disown or hate them. If you believe that your child ""chooses"" the lifestyle they are living, and could just as well choose a heterosexual lifestyle, ask yourself: Who would voluntarily choose a life marked by fear of discovery, discrimination, and isolation by classmates, friends, colleagues, and family? Would you choose to live in circumstances that made your life a lot more difficult and keep it that way just for the heck of it?

, For some people, it is not a big deal. It is just one aspect of who they are. For other people, it is fundamental to who they are. It is important for you to understand where your child is coming from. If it is just one aspect of who they are, repeatedly encouraging them to date and talking about their orientation may upset them. If on the other hand, it is fundamental to who they are, being more of an LGBT+ activist and inquiring into your child's dating life may be more appreciated.

Don't overreact when you hear bad words from your child.,
Consider your own swearing.,
Consider filtering some exposure to bad language.,
Talk to your child about swearing.,
Offer some alternatives.",How to Act if Your Child Has Started Saying Bad Words," Sure, it's not what you want to hear, but the situation isn't doomed. You haven't raised an uncouth monster; there are many avenues through which your child might have been exposed to swearing. Many would say that not all swearing is bad, but you need to help your child learn what language is appropriate in what settings. This can take some time, but they'll get there. Be firm but patient.
, Think whether you or other family members have said bad words near the child. Most people simply do not realize that in a burst of emotions they use obscene words. Control your own speech to set an example for your child., You can't control everything your child hears, but you may want to limit access to movies, TV shows, or games that use a lot of bad language regularly.

Don't try to control your child's exposure to friends who swear. Once they're in a school environment, a lot of kids will use foul language. It's fruitless to try to limit their exposure to that; your better bet is to focus on teaching them appropriate settings for certain words and appropriate alternatives to swearing.
Do not rush to change the school or kindergarten if the child admits that he or she has been taught bad words there. Children are the same everywhere. Yes, you can discuss the problem with a teacher and with other parents, but seeking to remove them from the environment every time someone around them swears isn't realistic.

, Tell your child (without shouting and threats) that swearing can be offensive or make you seem ignorant or uncultured. Emphasize that is necessary to develop vocabulary in order to express his or her thoughts properly., It's human to get angry and want to express that anger sometimes. Offer your child some alternatives that you're comfortable with. Words like ""shoot"" or ""sugar"" can come in handy, or even some ""softer"" swearing. You have to decide where that line is, and it likely depends on their age. For example, if you're okay with them saying ""crap"" instead of the worse alternatives, then suggest that. If you'd rather they stick to purely polite language, make it clear what's appropriate to you and model that language consistently."

Take opportunities to become a chaperone for school trips.,
Attend all parent association meetings for your child's school.,
Help out in your child's classroom.,
Attend in-school events.",How to Be a Good Parent Volunteer at Your Child's School1," Attending a school trip with your child is a great way to spend a lot of time with their classmates and teachers. Usually, students will be given notice that chaperones are required for an upcoming field trip and need parent volunteers. Take these opportunities when they become available. If you want to be more proactive with your approach, you can call the school's office and ask if there are any upcoming school trips that you can chaperone.Understand that being a chaperone means setting and enforcing limits on children for their own safety.Ask the staff and faculty what they need help with the most.;
, Your school may have a parent-teacher association that helps parent and teacher connections and helps drive initiatives inside of the school. Becoming a member of your local PTA will give you additional resources and insight into the operations at your child's school. To find your local PTA, look at the National PTA's website.If you are having issues finding your local parent-teacher association, give your school a call or send an e-mail to the National PTA at info@pta.org.

, A great opportunity to get connected is to volunteer as a classroom helper. While classroom assistant jobs are often labor intensive paid positions, there may be opportunities to volunteer to help younger kids work on developing on their foundations, such as reading and writing. Check the school's policies and call them to see if there are any volunteer opportunities to become a classroom helper.

, Events like book fairs, family fun nights, or festivals held at the school during school hours can use more volunteers to help set up and manage the event.Contact the school or speak to the teachers who are organizing the event to see where you can lend your assistance.


Other opportunities to help organized sports team or a specific club may also arise.
When you call, you can say something like ""My son Trevor told me that there's a book fair coming up in February. I was wondering if you'd need any parent volunteers or if you could connect me to the right person to speak to.""

Emphasize feelings, not a number or a look.,
Offer encouragement, not punishment.,
Be mindful even when you are trying to give compliments or be supportive.,
Avoid talking about body size and type.,
Compliment your child’s non-physical attributes.,
Critique clothing choices carefully.,
Assign health value — not moral value — to food.,
Make subtle changes to the family diet and activities.,
Don’t equate indulgence with failure.,
Stop body shaming yourself.,
Don’t judge others by their appearance either.,
Forget about dieting, for yourself and your child.",How to Avoid Body Shaming Your Children," Instead of intentionally or unintentionally reinforcing the notion that a largely-unrealistic body type is the key to health, wealth, and happiness, help your child to see that happiness truly does come from within. A “perfect” body does not cure all ills, but a positive self image makes a huge difference in overall happiness.Don’t set a target weight for your child, or make fitting into “that” dress or suit the priority. Instead, talk about how making healthier food and lifestyle choices can improve energy and mood, and “practice what you preach” in your own life.
Talk about the problems your child thinks a better body or look will “fix.” Building up your child’s self esteem by paying attention and offering encouragement will be far more beneficial than superficial changes.;
, As a parent, it’s easy to assume that the “don’t punish your kids” advice you hear or read about must come from “experts” who don’t actually have kids. This advice doesn’t mean letting your kids run wild and get away with anything, though; it means creating conditions that encourage good behavior and choices instead of using shame (the basis for all punishment) to “correct” poor choices.Body shaming through words or actions in an attempt to “correct” your child’s food or lifestyle choices is likely to backfire. It creates a self-fulfilling prophecy that causes many kids to “give up” or accept that an “inferior” body image and low self-worth is their fate.
Instead of punishing your child for eating a whole box of cookies, or sitting on the couch all afternoon, create inducements for other choices. Whip up some simple but healthy snacks. Offer to play soccer or go for a bike ride with your child.

, Saying things like “Oh, it looks like you’ve lost weight” or “That outfit is very flattering on you” may seem like nice compliments to give, but they also send the message that something about the child needed to be “fixed” or concealed. Even calling someone “beautiful on the inside” indicates that the same is not true on the outside. Always choose your words carefully, and be strictly supportive.Strip your compliments of any “backhanded” elements and just say “You look so beautiful” or “You are such a wonderful young person.”

, Many teens, and even younger children, feel a great deal of pressure to look a certain way. As such, they can be very sensitive to any comments that can be perceived as proof that they don’t measure up. The safest route as a parent is to limit any comments about your child’s body size or type, or those of other kids.It may never even occur to you that saying “My, you’ve really filled out” can be interpreted by a child as a harsh body critique. Be wary of using words like “big,” “curvy,” “full,” “stocky,” “stout,” and so on. Stick to commenting on how your kid is “growing up so fast.”
Complimenting another child’s appearance in front of your kid can also be perceived as veiled criticism. If you say “Boy, isn’t she lovely” or “What a handsome young man” about one of your child’s friends, your kid may assume that you are comparing him or her negatively to this “superior” example.
Remember that you can also unintentionally body shame by commenting that a child “needs to put some meat on those bones,” is “skinny as a rail,” and so on., Sometimes just an absence of compliments can be interpreted as body shaming. If you are always talking about how thin or good-looking your child is, he or she may notice if you go awhile without saying so (even without any intent on your part). Try to make sure that the majority of your compliments are about more than looks and focus on all the other wonderful qualities of your child.Try saying things like “I’m so proud of the wonderful person you’re becoming,” or “I’m so glad that your hard work is paying off in math class.”
If you child is in the process of trying to lose weight, don’t say “Oh, I think you look a bit thinner” — say “You seem so much happier and full of energy since you started this exercise program.”

, As your child grows up, he or she is sure to pick out and put on clothes that you deem inappropriate because they are too revealing, ill-fitting, etc. Unfortunately, your criticisms may unintentionally play into a form of body shaming known as “slut shaming”. Don’t make your child feel like something less because he or she can’t “pull off” a certain look.


You may also want to focus on teaching your child about appropriate clothing choices for different situations. For example, you could explain the difference between clothes that are appropriate for school or work and clothes that are appropriate for spending time with friends.
Focus on practicality: “I don’t think those shorts will be very comfortable to wear all day — especially during marching band practice after school.” Or, “I don’t think those clothes are allowed by your school’s dress code.”
Despite good intentions, remove the words “flattering” and “slimming” from your vocabulary when talking about clothes. They are too easily interpreted as code for “hides how overweight / unattractive you are.”, Some foods are healthier than others, and children should be encouraged to eat healthy foods. However, labeling foods as either “good” or “bad” also transfers that judgment to the person who chooses to eat the food. Making a child feel “bad” because he or she ate a “bad” food is more likely to reinforce body insecurities than it is to cause a change in eating patterns.Emphasize the positive benefits of choosing healthier foods — the added energy and focus, the improved mood, and so on. Also talk about how unhealthy foods, like those full of fat and sugar, may provide a temporary good feeling when eaten, but make us tired, lethargic, moody, cranky, etc. in the long run. It’s not inherently “bad” to eat these foods, it simply makes more sense to choose them less often.

, If your child does need to lose (or gain) weight for health reasons, don’t single him or her out for a special diet and exercise program. Talk about how the whole family will feel better and be healthier if some positive adjustments are made. Don’t make the child feel ashamed because his or her “failures” are “punishing” the entire family.Sometimes, you can simply make small but steady changes that may go virtually unnoticed. Start buying fewer snack foods and sodas and stock more fruits, vegetables, and water bottles. Set aside additional time for family physical activities, like pickup basketball games or volunteering to do regular yard work for an elderly neighbor.

, Making a child feel like a failure — whether it’s for striking out with the game on the line, doing poorly on a test, or eating all the potato chips — rarely spurs positive change. Instead, it usually causes either a negative backlash or an internalization of inadequacy. Whenever such situations arise, use them as opportunities to talk, share, and learn together.Work to direct your child’s snacking habits towards healthy alternatives by stocking and offering nutritious options. Also consider whether an excessive snacking habit is being caused by stress, anxiety, or issues other than hunger. Talk to your child, and involve his or her doctor or a professional counselor as needed.

, Even as they become teens and act as though they want nothing to do with you, kids learn and model behaviors based upon your example as a parent. If you constantly denigrate your own appearance, your child will internalize this as a normal behavior.In the advertising and media landscape that surrounds all of us, there already exists a dominant narrative that “thin” equals “good” and “happy.” If you support this narrative by the way in which you respond to your own body, you will further ingrain it into your children., We’ve all made or at least laughed at a “fat joke” at some point, and judged an overweight stranger’s food choices at a restaurant. Even if you would never intentionally body shame your own child, he or she will “connect the dots” and assume that you judge his or her perceived appearance shortcomings in the same way.Make it clear from the start that it is never acceptable to denigrate another person based upon his or her appearance, whether to the person’s face or anonymously online. Emphasize that all people are worthy of respect and appreciation. Use the inevitable “slip-ups” as learning opportunities. Ask your child to put himself or herself in that other person’s shoes., Diets don’t work in the long run; changing behaviors and habits can, however. If you go on recurring diets, you create a sense that there is something wrong that needs to be fixed. Instead, emphasize the benefits of making positive changes in areas like diet and activity levels.Learn to be happy in your own skin, while striving to be the best, healthiest “you” possible. Share this view with your child through your actions and your words.

Interact with children of different ages.,
Forge a good relationship with staff and teachers.,
Be timely and reliable.,
Communicate with other volunteers.,
Get other parents to become volunteers.,
Maintain a positive and encouraging attitude.",How to Be a Good Parent Volunteer at Your Child's School2," Interacting with children from a wide range of age groups will give you increased versatility when volunteering. Skills managing and helping younger children don't always translate to teens. Young children have more energy and are more inquisitive than teens or pre-teens tend to be.Your goal as a volunteer is to get your kids involved and participating as a group.

, Becoming a better parent volunteer involves becoming more connected with your child's school and what they are doing. If teachers or staff have an open-door policy, make sure to utilize it.Communicate with teachers and determine places that they may need help. You may hear of opportunities to volunteer first, and you can also make your own recommendations on how to improve your child's education.


Talk to staff at events and see what they need help with the most.
You can say something like ""Hey, what do you need help with the most right now? I'm trying to be as helpful as possible, just let me know where to go and what to do.""

, Timeliness and reliability are important factors in being a good volunteer. Pledging your time and effort and then pulling out at the last second could leave a trip with not enough parent chaperones or create a problem for an event. Don't underestimate your other responsibilities in your life. Make an accurate estimate of the time that you can invest before offering your help., Often volunteer opportunities will mean working on a team comprised of other parent volunteers. To better meet the goals of your volunteer time, make sure to talk to and work with the other volunteers in the group. Working on a cohesive team will make doing things easier and faster. Make sure to designate required roles with other volunteers and to fulfill your own responsibilities.

, Speak with other parents outside of school events and encourage them to help at the school. Talk to them about the need for help for certain organizations or classes, and explain the difficulties the students have due to a lack of volunteers. Try to convince other parents on the positive benefit that volunteering has on their children's education.


You can say something like, ""I volunteered at the middle school and it was a great time. They really need help over there, and I saw that it actually made an impact on my son's education.""

, Your attitude should always be good to both the students that you're helping as well as the staff and teachers that are instructing them. Keeping an upbeat and positive attitude will contribute to maintaining positive morale for the kids and will make events and education more fun. If you like working with kids, show it, and allow your enthusiasm to shine through."

Offer help during times that fit your schedule.,
Use a vacation day to attend an event.,
Tutor when you aren't working.",How to Be a Good Parent Volunteer at Your Child's School3," If you have a busy work schedule and can't accommodate the time that you can, make sure to take every opportunity to volunteer on your free time. This can include less structured volunteer help such as printing out flyers, sending emails, or helping your children with school projects can take the pressure off another overworked parent volunteer.You can also bake or cook food for school events if you can find the extra time.

, If you have a busy work schedule and miss events and fundraisers at your child's school, make sure to take a break from work and dedicate a day during the year towards your child. Talk to your kid about an upcoming event that they need your help with, and talk to your supervisor at work about taking off to help them for the day.


If your job already comes with paid-time-off, this is a great opportunity to use a vacation day.
Ask for your day off at least two weeks in advance.
You can ask by saying something like, ""My kid is having a class trip on December 7th, so I'm requesting off that day so I can help chaperone.""

, Tutoring and mentoring kids is especially important in larger schools with more students because there's a chance they don't get enough one-on-one education. Try to find struggling kids in your children's classroom and invite them over after work and help them with their homework or class projects.Some schools have structured tutoring sessions at the school that you can attend.Make sure to clear the tutoring session with the children's parents before they come over.
Overworked teachers will appreciate the extra help that you provide the students.

Leverage your professional background.,
Assist with extracurricular activities and sports.,
Be active in setting school policies and curriculum.",How to Be a Good Parent Volunteer at Your Child's School4," Think of your professional and educational background and choose a club that you can make the most impact in. For example, if you have a writing background you could help students create a poetry or creative writing club. If you have a finance background, you could think of innovative improvements to school fundraisers. Think of the skills that you have to leverage and use them to make the most impact on students.You can call the school and get a list of current programs.
Talk to your child about starting a school club that doesn't exist by saying something like, ""So I noticed your school doesn't have a poetry club. I know you like writing, do you think you'd want to start that up? I can help you.""

, Drama clubs, civic organizations, hobby clubs, and sports teams are sometimes in need of help due to limited resources and limited time. These activities and sports can hinge on the help of parent volunteers. Get into contact with activity leaders or sports coaches and talk to them about volunteer opportunities.


Parent volunteers are often needed as chaperones during away games.
If you have a sports background, you are better suited to helping children on the school's sports team.

, In some states and jurisdictions, parent's have a more active role in setting the policies and curriculum within a school.This means having to attend parent-teacher association meetings and being vocal in what you think is best for your children's education. As a parent, you have the right to know what kind of programs and supports are being implemented to help your child and all children within your local school.


See if you can get an hour-by-hour schedule of what will be discussed in the meetings so that you can create your own input.

Encourage older kids to get a job.",How to Teach Kids About Money," ""Kids are surprisingly aware of what's going on in the world,"" says Tyson. ""And if they don't know that times are a little bit tough and Mom & Dad are having to watch their spending, it's time to tell them. Sheltering kids from financial realities does them no favors."" A good grasp of personal finance is one of the most valuable life skills a person can have. And while previous generations may have been raised with the constant admonishment that ""money doesn't grow on trees!"" too many of today's parents neglect that lesson. It's time to change that—and the economic crisis we're in now provides a great incentive for doing so.;
, Kids are perceptive. If you've been acting anxious and on edge lately, they've noticed. Rather than let them wonder why Mom and Dad are working so much lately or constantly talking about money, explain (on their level) what's going on in the family's financial world. This might mean explaining why vacations have to be cut back, why there will be fewer toys under the tree etc.

, Some parents are surprised to find out that their kids don't have a very good grasp on what things cost because they have been sheltering them from this always. A great hands-on way to open their eyes is to take them on a ""money tour"" around the house. For example, kids might not understand that hot water costs more than cold water, or that bumping up the heat results in higher power bills. This exercise will teach them how they can conserve and thus help the family save money. You can also pile up all of the bills for the month and have them look at the amount on each one. Show them what the family's cost of living is and again reiterate the areas where they can play a part in reducing the costs.

, Teach them the importance of not over spending their budget. While they should not be dictated on how every rupee ought to be spent, ask them once in a while how they spend their pocket money to teach them to keep track of money. Encourage kids to save money to purchase something they’d like to have. Say your 12 year old wants a new bicycle or a watch. Make a deal with him/her that when he/she accumulates a portion of the money required you’ll chip in the rest.Children will be more responsible with money when they know the effort it takes to procure it. You can encourage your older teens to take up small jobs at cafes, cake shops or eating joints to earn pocket money in the vacations.

, It may sound like common sense, but you—Mom and Dad—are your kids' most influential teachers. When you ring up a barge-load of credit card debt, take out exorbitant mortgages or car loans, and fail to save anything, that's what your kids come to see as normal. If you are modeling unhealthy financial habits, you can't realistically expect your kids to ""do as I say, not as I do.""

, Kids are constantly bombarded with information about expensive things, whether it's the fancy sports car they like, the wardrobe of their favorite athlete or actor or the many appeals to luxury in the 40,000 commercials that the American Academy of Pediatrics estimates the average American child sees each year. What they aren't bombarded with is knowledge on how to manage money effectively. And while schools are increasingly incorporating money issues into the existing curriculum, the broader concepts of personal financial management still aren't taught. Frightening though it may be, some schools rely on free ""educational"" materials from the likes of VISA and MasterCard!

, An allowance is a great teaching tool. You don't have to break child labor laws to find great ways to help your kids earn their allowance rather than just have it handed over to them. A well-implemented allowance program can mimic many money matters that adults face every day throughout their lives. From recognizing the need to earn the green stuff to learning how to responsibly and intelligently spend, save, and invest their allowance, children can gain a solid financial footing from a young age.

, It's never too early to start saving, and the sooner you can instill the importance of saving money into your kids the better. After they start earning an allowance, have your kids save a significant portion (up to half) of their allowance money toward longer-term goals, such as college (just be careful about putting money in children's names as doing so can harm college financial aid awards). Tyson recommends that children reserve about one-third of their weekly take for savings. As they accumulate more significant savings over time, you can introduce the concept of investing.

, The primary path to reduced exposure to ads is to cut down on TV time. When kids are in front of the tube, have them watch prerecorded material. You can direct the television viewing of younger children, in particular, toward videos and DVDs. And for older kids, if you use digital video recorders (DVRs), such as TIVO, you can easily zap ads. But when an ad does sneak under the radar and set the kids to begging, address it. Explain to your kids that there's never a good time for frivolous impulse spending—but it's especially harmful when money is tight.

, You'll probably face an uphill battle when teaching kids about personal finance. That's why it's so important to find entertaining ways to instill good financial habits in them. For younger kids Tyson recommends age-appropriate books like The Berenstain Bears Get the Gimmies. For late-elementary-school-aged kids, Quest for the Pillars of Wealth by J.J. Pritchard is a chapter book that teaches the major personal finance concepts through an engaging adventure story. You could also get them a subscription to Zillions, a kids' magazine from the publishers of Consumer Reports, which covers money and buying topics. Consider playing the board games Monopoly and Life to teach more money skills as well.

, Family shopping trips, whether for groceries or something else, are likely to be your kids' first encounter with spending. They'll see you make decisions based on what the family needs, maybe see the occasional coupon used, and will observe how you pay. These trips are a great time to teach them lessons about money and the value of product research and comparison shopping.

, Those plastic cards in your wallet offer a convenient way to conduct purchases in stores, by phone, and over the Internet. Unfortunately, credit cards offer temptation for overspending and carrying debt from month to month. Teach your kids the difference between a credit and debit card, explaining that debit cards are connected to your checking account and thus prevent you from overspending as you can on a credit card. Make credit card usage the exception, not the rule.

, An allowance doesn't have to be the only way for your kids to earn money. Your child's initial exposure to the work-for-pay world can start with something as simple as a lemonade stand. Depending on age, he or she might do yard work for neighbors or offer babysitting services. And the fact that we're in a recession makes it all the more appropriate for older kids to ""help out"" by getting a part-time job—especially to fund unnecessary purchases like DVDs or cool clothing.

They make developing their child’s character their top priority. Once you're a parent, you have to learn to put your priorities below your children's, and to make the sacrifice to spending more of your day caring for them than you do caring for yourself. Of course, you shouldn't neglect yourself completely, but you should get accustomed to the idea of putting your child's needs first.


If you have a spouse, then you can take turns caring for the child so each of you can have some ""me time.""
When you plan your weekly routine, your child's needs should be your primary focus.;
, Your 15 year old will particular appreciate this. Helping to nurture a love for the written word will help your child to develop a love for reading later on. Set a time for reading for your child every day -- typically around bedtime or nap time. Spend at least half an hour to an hour reading to your child each day, if not more. Not only will your child develop a love for words, but your child will have a better chance of both academic and behavioral success. Studies show that children that were read to on a daily basis demonstrate less bad behavior in school.Once your child starts learning to read or write, let your child take over. Don't correct his or her mistakes every two seconds, or your child will get discouraged.

, One of the most dangerous trends in the modern family is the dying of the family meal. The dinner table is not only a place of sustenance and family business but also a place for the teaching and passing on of our values. Manners and rules are subtly absorbed over the table. Family mealtime should communicate and sustain ideals that children will draw on throughout their lives.If your child is a picky eater, don't spend dinner time criticizing your child's eating habits and watching what he or she doesn't eat like a hawk. This will lead your child to have a negative association with family meals.
Get your child involved in the meal. Dinner will be more fun if your child ""helps"" you pick out food at the grocery store or helps you set up the table or to do small food-related tasks, such as washing the vegetables you will cook. An older child can obviously handle more than vegetable washing. Involve all the family in menu planning for the family.
Keep dinner conversation open and light. Don't give your child the third-degree. Simply ask, ""How was your day?""

, Though your child doesn't have to go to bed during the same five-minute stretch every single night, you should set a bedtime routine that your child can follow and stick to it. Studies show that children's cognitive abilities can drop two full grade levels after just one missed hour of sleep, so it's important that they get as much rest as they can before you send them to school.Your routine should include some winding-down time. Turn off the TV, music, or any electronics, and either talk to your child softly in bed or read to him.
Don't give your child sugary snacks right before bed or it'll be harder to get him to sleep.

, Though you don't have to sign your child up for ten different activities each week, you should find at least one or two activities that your child loves to do and incorporate them into your child's weekly routine. This can be anything from soccer to art class -- it really doesn't matter, as long as your child shows a talent or a love for something. Tell your child what a great job he's doing and encourage him to keep going.


Taking your child to different lessons will also help him or her socialize with other children.
Don't get lazy. If your child complains that she doesn't want to go to piano lessons, but you know she likes it deep down, don't give in just because you don't feel like driving over there.

, ""Play time"" does not mean having your child sit in front of the TV and suck on a building block while you do the dishes. ""Play time"" means letting your child sit in his room or play area and to actively engage with stimulating toys while you help him explore their possibilities. Though you may be tired, it's important that you show your child the benefits of playing with his toys so he gets the stimulation he needs and so he learns to play with them on his own.


It doesn't matter if you don't have 80 million toys for your child to play with. It's the quality, not the quantity of the toys that counts. And you may find that your child's favorite toy of the month is an empty toilet paper roll.

, Influencing their lives is one of the greatest things you can do. It is easy to tune out our children, and a miss an opportunity for meaningful guidance. If you never listen to your children and spend all of your time barking orders at them, they won't feel respected or cared for.


Encourage your children to talk. Helping them express themselves early on can help them communicate successfully in the future.

, Don't ever forget that your child is a living, breathing human being who has needs and wants just like the rest of us. If your child is a picky eater, don't nag him constantly at the dinner table; if he's slow to potty train, don't embarrass him by talking about it in public; if you promised your child you'd take him to the movies if he was good, don't take back your promise because you're too tired.If you respect your child, then it's much more likely that your child will respect you back.

, It's a myth that loving your child ""too much,"" praising your child ""too much,"" or showering your child with ""too much"" affection can make your child spoiled rotten. Giving your child love, affection, and attention will positively encourage your child to develop as a human being. Giving your child toys instead of love, or not reprimanding your child for bad behavior is what will lead you to spoil your child.


Tell your child how much you love him at least once a day -- but preferably, as often as you can.

, It will take effort and strength to be there for your child every day, but if you want to encourage your child to develop his own interests and character, you have to create a strong support system for him. This doesn't mean you have to follow your child around every second of the day, but it does mean that you have to be there for all of the little moments, from his first soccer game to family time at the beach.


Once your child starts school, you should know what classes he's taking and the names of his teachers. Go over your child's homework with him and help him with any difficult tasks, but do not do it for him.
As your child gets older, you can start pulling back a bit, and encouraging your child to explore his interests without you by his side all the time.

, You can still be there for your child while encouraging him to explore his own interests. Don't tell your child which lessons to take; let him pick from a variety of options. You can help dress your child, but go clothes shopping together with your child, so he has some say in his appearance. And if your child wants to play with his friends or to play with his toys by himself without you there, let him build his own identity from time to time.If you encourage independence early on, your child will be much more likely to think for himself as an adult.

, They will ignore these limits on occasion. Reasonable punishment is one of the ways human beings have always learned. Children must understand what punishment is for and know that its source is parental love.


As a parent, you will need cognitive tools if you are to adjust unwanted behaviours. Instead of making up a confusing, non-related punishment like, ""If you ride your tricycle into the street, you will have to balance this book on your head,"" withdraw a privilege. The child must naturally connect the privilege withdrawal with the behavior: ""If you ride your tricycle into the street, you lose the use of your tricycle for the rest of the day.""
Don't use violent forms of punishment, such as spanking or hitting. Children who are spanked or hit aren't any more likely to listen. Parents should never hit a child, under any circumstances. Children who are spanked, hit, or slapped are more prone to fighting with other children. They are more likely to be bullies and more likely to use aggression to solve disputes with others.Children exposed to family violence are also more likely to develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. .

, Rewarding your child for good behavior is even more important than punishing your child for bad behavior. Letting your child know when he or she is doing something right will encourage the behavior in the future. If your child behaved well, from sharing his toys at a play date to being patient during a car ride, then let him know you noticed his good behavior; don't just say nothing when your child behaves well and punish him when he does not.


Don't underestimate the importance of praising your child for good behavior. Saying, ""I'm so proud of you for..."" can make your child feel that his good behavior is really appreciated.
You can give your child toys or treats from time to time, but don't make your child think that he deserves a toy any time he does something good.

, If you want to discipline your child effectively, then you have to be consistent. You can't punish your child for doing something one day, and then give him candy to stop doing it another day, or even say nothing because you're too tired to put up a fight. And if your child does something good, like using the bathroom correctly during potty training, make sure you praise your child every time. Consistency is what reinforces good and bad behavior.


If you and a spouse are raising your child together, then you should be a united front against your children, using the same disciplinary methods. There should be no ""good cop, bad cop"" routine in your home.

, If you really want your child to recognize your disciplinary methods, then you have to be able to explain why your child can't do certain things. Do not just tell him not to be mean to other children, or to clean up his toys; tell him why this behavior will be good for him, for you, and for society at large. Making a connection between your child's actions and what they mean will help your child understand your decision-making process.

, This is an important part of disciplining your child and building his character. If he does something wrong, like throwing his food on the ground, make sure he owns up to the behavior and explains why he did it, instead of blaming it on someone else or even denying it. After your child does something naughty, have a conversation about why it happened.


It's important for your child to know that everyone makes mistakes. The mistake isn't as important as the way your child reacts to it.

, We gain virtue through practice. Parents should help children by promoting moral action through self-discipline, good work habits, kind and considerate behavior to others, and community service. The bottom line in character development is behavior--their behavior. If your child is too young for real humanitarian behavior, you can always teach your child to be kind toward others, no matter his age.

, Face it: human beings learn primarily through modeling. In fact, you can’t avoid being an example to your children, whether good or bad. Being a good example, then, is probably your most important job. If you yell at your child and then tell her never to yell, kick the wall when you're angry, or make mean comments about your neighbors, your child will think that this behavior is okay.Start being a good role model from day one. Your child will be aware of your moods and behavior earlier than you think.

, Children are like sponges. Much of what they take in has to do with moral values and character. Books, songs, TV, the Internet, and films are continually delivering messages—moral and immoral—to our children. As parents we must control the flow of ideas and images that are influencing our children.


If you and your child see something upsetting, such as two people in an argument at the grocery store or a clip about violence on the news, don't miss the opportunity to talk about it with your child.

, Teaching your child to say ""Thank you,"" and ""please,"" and to treat others with a baseline of respect will go a long way in helping them succeed in the future. Don't underestimate the power of teaching your child to be kind to adults, to respect their elders, and to avoid fighting with or picking on other children. Good manners will follow your children for the rest of their lives, and you should start modeling it as soon as possible.


One crucial aspect of good manners is cleaning up after yourself. Teach your child to clean up after his own toys when he's three, and he'll make a great house guest when he's twenty-three.

, Though you may feel the urge to curse, complain, or say negative things about a person you know in front of your child, even if you're just talking on the phone, remember that your child is always paying attention. And if you're having a heated argument with your spouse, it's better to do it behind closed doors so your child can't mimic your negative behavior.


If you do use a bad word and your child notices it, don't pretend like it did not happen. Apologize and say it won't happen again. If you say nothing, then your child will think these words are okay.

, Empathy is an important skill and one that you can never teach too early. If your child knows how to have empathy for others, then he'll be able to see the world from a more judgment-free perspective and will be able to put himself in someone else's shoes. Let's say your child comes home and tells you that his friend Jimmy was mean to him; try to talk about what happened and see if you can figure out how Jimmy might be feeling and what led to the negative behavior.Or, if a waitress forgets your order in a restaurant, don't tell your child that she's lazy or stupid; instead, point out how tired she must be after spending all day on her feet.

, Teaching your child to be truly grateful is different than forcing your child to say ""thank you"" all the time. To truly teach your child to be grateful, you have to say ""thank you"" all the time yourself, so your child sees the good behavior. If your child complains that everyone in school has a new toy that you won't let her get, remind her how many people are less fortunate than she is.Expose her to people of all walks of life so she understands how privileged she is, even if that means she won't be getting a Nintendo DS for Christmas.
Saying, ""I didn't hear you say thank you..."" after your child misses this point won't actually get the message across as much as saying ""thank you"" yourself and making sure your child hears you.

Keep your child's important papers, including birth certificate, passport (if they have one) and social security card locked up in a safe place.,
When a business asks for a social security number for your child, always ask them why they need it.,
Refuse to give out your child's birth certificate or social security number unless absolutely necessary.,
Make sure that any activity your child participates in uses the information properly and handles it with care.,
Check your child's social security earnings record.,
Educate your children about safe Internet use.,
Keep your computer virus software and defenses up to date at all times.",How to Protect Your Child from Identity Theft," Anything that has personal identifiers and could be used as identification needs to be kept safe. If you need to take these documents anywhere for proof of your child's identity, always know where they are and remember to bring them back home with you after showing them.


Never carry your child’s social security card in your wallet. Keep it in a secure place, preferably in a safe at home.;
, In the United States, you will be asked for your child's social security number even more often than for the birth certificate. Many businesses, especially hospitals and doctors’ offices, still use social security numbers as identifiers.


Keep a record of who has the social security number of your child. Should anything untoward happen, this might help investigations into tracking down the culprit. A simple list kept with the birth certificate and social security number file will suffice; just remember to jot it down each time the number has been shared with a relevant authority.

, The use of this number should only be official or professional purposes, such as when you enroll your children in school, get them a passport, pay taxes, open financial accounts, or apply for their first driver’s license. If the number is requested by an organization or person who wouldn't normally receive the number, demand official identification and seek a valid reason for sharing it. Privacy advocates advise being skeptical when asked for the social security number when there is no apparent need for it, such as church groups and vacation camps., For example, it is expected that a sports institution will handle the information confidentially, as sports teams often require a birth certificate for sign up. Expect the same for clubs, associations and any other activity you sign your child up for.


Ask how the information is stored, in what format and what safeguards are in place during storage.
Ask for reassurance of the continued confidentiality of the information.
Ask them how they plan to dispose of the information after it's no longer needed. Nothing beyond proper shredding (cross-shredding with other information)or return of all originals or copies is acceptable unless legislation lays out an alternative means.

, Many identity thefts go undetected because parents don't assume that the child even has a credit or earnings report.Requesting these regularly can allow you to get on top of theft quickly. It is recommended that you:


Request an annual Social Security Earnings record. This is the most important thing to keep track of because it can alert you if someone uses your child's Social Security to obtain a job. To request a report, call 1-800-772-1213 or visit http://www.ssa.gov/online/ssa-7004.html.
Request a free credit report each year for your child from each of the three major credit reporting companies, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion annually. Credit agencies don't begin a credit history on an individual until particular details are used to open a credit account. This information can include name, age, address and Social Security number. Bear in mind that this check may not alert you to abuse because names and birth dates may have been changed,so use the SSN check foremost.

, Teach them to keep all personal information private when they are online. Social networking sites are havens for identity thieves scanning these sites and children can innocently provide information without thinking if they haven't been alerted about what to recognize and avoid in advance.

, For many people, identity theft has occurred through cyber-attacks in which the children's identifying information has been lifted from hacked computers.Always keep your computer anti-virus and anti-malware programs up-to-date.


Consider not keeping anything that identifies your child in this way on a computer that accesses the internet. If you want to keep it in electronic form, keep it on a standalone computer that doesn't get connected to the internet.
Avoid posting photos of your children online. There are many good reasons for resisting doing this and this is another one, especially if geo-coding gives away the residential zone of your child.

Learn about what is happening and why so that you will be able to share the facts with your child.,
Talk to your child about what is happening and why.,
Let the child ask you questions and explain what these things mean, and why they happen.,
Explain a little bit about your family's financial plan if you have one.,
Take action to establish a financial plan if you don't already have one.,
Keep the lines of communication open all the way through the crisis.,
Help your children have financial awareness.",How to Talk to Your Children About a Financial Crisis," If the crisis is a complete mystery to you, it is going to be hard for you to put your child at ease. Conversely, if you have a good grasp of what the facts and the dangers are, you will be able to allay many of your child's fears.;
, Give plenty of time for the child to tell you what the child is hearing at school and from friends. Maybe there is worry about a friend who is going through a foreclosure, or who is unable to attend dance lessons because they have lost the family car or can't get the financing to replace a car which is no longer functional.

, Use terms which are simple and understandable to a child of that particular age. Your child may not know what a mortgage is, or may not know why a foreclosure would occur. Explain the best you can in terms they can grasp. Inevitably, if the child has a friend who faces foreclosure or eviction, your child is going to worry that your family will might lose your house or apartment. Don't let your child suffer in needless worry. This is a time for full communication. Put your child's mind at ease by explaining that foreclosure or eviction is unlikely for you. Or, if you do fear foreclosure or eviction could occur, explain what your plans would be for alternate living arrangements. You may know that you can go and live with grandma for a few months, or with a good family friend, but your child may not realize this is an option until you say so.

, You can go into as much detail as you like, or you can speak in general terms. The important thing is to let the child know that you have a plan and that your plan is very likely to get you through the crisis. If you have a lot of money in bonds, then by all means say so, and explain that this gives you a very high level of security. Or if you have a good mix of stock funds, you can explain that you have chosen to accept a certain level of risk, and that your family can tolerate losing some value in stocks, so that there is no need to worry. Explain that you are going to hold on to the shares you own, and that stocks do recover after a downturn. Talk about the stability of your job. If you are a little uncertain about things, maybe you have started cutting back on extras, like meals out of the home. Explain that you are holding down spending because it is prudent to watch your spending more closely when things get rough in the economy. The child will probably feel better that you are taking action if he or she knows you are doing it in order to keep the family secure financially. The child will be more likely to support your decisions, and that will help the family stay in harmony through the financial crisis. It is important that you all pull together and support each other in order to get through this period.

, Speak to friends who know more about money management than you do, and start reading some good basic financial books. Educate yourself about finances. Learning about money is easier than you might think, and you must know about the basics so that money managers you go to will be less likely to take advantage of you. Be smart so that they will not be able to sell you things which are not good for your longterm financial health. Once you start establishing a plan, bring your child into the process so that the child will learn the basics of good financial planning. It is important, too, for the child to know that you have started to take control. Children always feel better in a crisis when they know that the parents are facing the situation head on and doing all they can to keep the family safe.

, Stay on top of the news, and let your child know about any encouraging events in the markets or in your own situation. If you have bad news, explain it early so they will be aware of the situation, and will have time to digest the information. If you have good news, don't hesitate to share that and put their minds at ease.

, Teens could read books such as ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"". Younger children can work for a reward - such as a dollar - for such things as home projects.

Stay organized by creating a system for labeling your child’s clothes.,
Label everything at once.,
Place the label in the same place on each item of clothing.,
Choose what you want to write on the label.",How to Label Clothes for Daycare1," When you begin, pull out every item of clothing that your child will take to daycare, including gloves, boots, and coats in the winter, and sunglasses, swimsuits, and shorts in the summertime.;
, This will help keep track of what has been done. As your child grows and more clothing is purchased, label each item as it joins the closet.

, Check to make sure everything is labeled before you drop him off each day. A good place for labels are along the back of the clothing, such as the rear tag or seam, where it is out of reach from the child.


Periodically check the clothes after they come out of the laundry to make sure they are still labeled.

, You can either label the clothes with your child’s first name and last initial or just his initials. If you use initials or just your child’s first name, check with the daycare to make sure there aren’t other children with the same name or the same initials.


If you plan to pass the clothing down and use it on future children, label it simply with your last name.

"
"
Get a permanent marker.,
Consider using a laundry pen for tougher fabrics.,
Maintain the marker label.",How to Label Clothes for Daycare2," The most basic way to label a child’s clothes is with permanent marker, which is safe and works on most types of fabric. Choose a dark color marker like black, brown, or blue and label the clothing in an inconspicuous location, such as clothing tag or along the back inside neck seam.


Permanent markers are the least intrusive method in regards to daycare activity, and will stay in place no matter what activity your child pursues.

, For an even more permanent label, or if you are labeling delicate fabrics like lycra or silk, use a laundry pen, which works the same as a regular marker.


Let the marker dry for a few minutes before putting the clothes on your child.

, Permanent marker can fade after lots of washes, so you may have to re-label the clothes every few months.


Permanent markers and laundry pens are available at any office supply store or big box distributor and are definitely the least expensive labeling option.

Consider using tape as a less expensive ‘stick on label’.,
Replace the tape as it begins to fall off.,
Purchase professional sticker labels.,
Consider using a different method if your child is likely to peel the label off.",How to Label Clothes for Daycare3," The most basic version of stick-on labels is to use masking tape or painters tape and label it with a permanent marker. Cut a piece of the labeled tape and adhere it to your child’s clothes or the tag of the clothing.

, Some stronger tapes can last through a few washes, but in most cases you’ll need to put a new label on every day.

, You can also purchase sticker labels from online retailers and kids’ stores. Many companies produce labels to attach to the tags of children’s clothing. These labels last through the laundry but aren’t as durable as fabric labels.However, they are easy to apply and don’t show through on other parts of clothing.

, Stick-on labels are the easiest type of label to be removed, and may not be the best option if your child will fidget and pick at the label, or if they are around other children who will pull at the label.


They are, however, one of the less expensive options and easy to apply.

"
"
Decide whether you want to buy fabric labels, or make them yourself.,
Attach the label to your child’s clothing.,
Consider using an iron on fabric label.,
Make a homemade iron-on label.",How to Label Clothes for Daycare4," Sewn labels can either be purchased from online companies like It’s Mine Labels or Label Land or made on your own by cutting out small pieces of fabric and using a permanent marker, laundry pen, or hand stitching to label each square.

, To attach the label to the clothing, simply stitch around the edge of the label using a sewing machine, or hand sew it. Sewn labels don’t have the risk of getting lost because they are so firmly put on your child’s clothes. They also don’t leave as permanent a mark as writing straight on the fabric with a laundry pen.


However, they are hard to remove to pass the clothing down to other children and will show a visible stitch on the opposite side.

, A slightly less permanent, but still effective, approach to fabric labels is to use an iron-on version. These labels are also available from a variety of online companies or at a sewing or baby store.


To apply to clothing, follow the directions on the package and use an iron to cover the label completely for a few minutes.

, You can create homemade iron-on labels by cutting fabric squares and placing a piece of fusible, iron-on material (available at sewing stores) between the label and the clothing. Then simply follow the instructions on the iron-on material package to attach it to the clothing.


Iron-on labels are still sturdy and durable, but don’t show the seam that comes with sewing on the fabric labels. Because fabric labels are so sturdy, they tend to perform well at daycare, even during the most active activities.

Help your child to learn how to balance.,
Take your baby’s shoes off when they are trying to walk.,
Assess your child any time they take a spill.,
Follow the baby-proofing basics.",How to Keep Your Child Safe when They Are Learning to Walk1," A new walker is still figuring out how their body works, so always keep an eye on your child as they take their first steps. Help your child learn balance by supporting them and holding their hands as they begin to walk. They will soon be able to stand and walk on their own, but by holding their hands, you will help them avoid many of the spills that come with the first walking attempts.;
, Being barefoot will help your child to stay upright because bare feet can help improve your child’s balance and lessen the number of falls they take.


When your child goes outside or to public places, put them in a pair of flexible shoes that are made for children who are starting to learn how to walk.

, If your child falls (and it’s inevitable that they will), measure the severity of the fall and any injuries they sustained while offering them comfort and support.


After more serious injuries, keep an eye on your child to track their recovery. If they seem slow, groggy, or to be favoring a certain leg or side of their body, take them to the doctor.

, An increase in mobility means that very little is off-limits to your child. Keep them safe by baby-proofing your house. You are probably aware of the danger areas in your home from your child’s exploits in crawling and cruising. Typical danger areas include:

Stairs, where it is important to install a baby gate at the top and bottom.






Heated surfaces, such as radiators or furnaces, need to be covered with a grill or blocked by other furniture so a walking baby can’t reach them.






Cover electrical outlets with simple childproof plastic covers to avoid a child putting his or her fingers in the plug. To make sure everything is covered, get on your hands and knees to see things from a toddler’s point of view—this should help you to see potential hazards.

Remove clutter from the floor.,
Secure large pieces of furniture that can tip over easily.,
Be on the lookout for sharp corners of furniture.,
Keep your baby safe while they are in their crib.,
Baby-proof your windows.,
Tie back loose curtains or blind strings to avoid the risk of strangling.,
Keep your child safe from your fireplace.",How to Keep Your Child Safe when They Are Learning to Walk2," Pick things up off the floor, including rugs or anything that could trip a toddler. Changes in flooring are particularly treacherous for a new walker, so be on the lookout for rough floor transitions or uneven flooring.


Dangerous floor can be easily covered with a foam play mat. Most play mats come in a variety of sizes and are made of connecting squares so that you can customize the mat to fit your space. Simply place the mat over the floor for a safer walking surface for your baby—no tools or installation required.

, Secure large pieces of furniture, like bookshelves and entertainment systems, to the wall. These large pieces of furniture can tip over easily if your baby walks into them or tries to climb them.


Attach the furniture with special baby proofing furniture hooks, found at your local home supply store, or simply use a few extra screws and hooks to make sure everything is safely attached to the wall.

, Add padding to sharp corners, which are often at head level, and remove and replace dangerous pieces. Furniture made out of hard materials, such as glass and stone, can be especially harmful. Pre-made furniture bumpers can be purchased; simply slide these bumpers onto the dangerous surfaces.


You can also make your own bumpers with quilt batting or pool noodles cut in half and slid over the rough edge.

, Now that your baby can stand up and walk, not even their own room is safe. Readjust the crib to the lowest position by removing the mattress and adjusting the bottom springs so they can’t climb out in the night.


Move the crib away from dangerous areas, such as windows and doors, or places where a child could climb or fall.

, Most children probably couldn’t reach windows before they could walk, but now windows pose a great safety threat. Install window guards, or adjustable mesh screens to stop your child from being able to open the window and fall out.


Window guards come with adjustable hardware that can be attached directly to the inside of the window or window frame. The result is a screen that doesn’t block the view, but blocks the option of a baby opening or climbing out the window.

, A simple way to do this is to loop blind cords together in a loose knot or tie the cords around a blind winder to keep them untangled and out of your baby’s reach.

, Fireplaces are especially dangerous because there are lots of way for children to get hurt, but they are also very appealing to a mobile toddler. Protect your baby from the fireplace by installing a fireplace lock. Similar to an oven lock, most fireplace locks connect with an adhesive strip to the wall and make it difficult for your child to open the fireplace door.


If you have a larger hearth and fireplace area, install a fireplace gate that wraps around and blocks off the entire area. These gates are typically installed with screws or hooks attached to the wall on either side of the fireplace and wrap around the front.
Place furniture bumpers on hard edges of a fireplace to create a soft landing.

Keep your cabinets closed and secure.,
Put dangerous supplies in cabinets that are high off the ground.,
Keep your child safe from the stove.",How to Keep Your Child Safe when They Are Learning to Walk3," Lock away harmful liquids and chemicals, such as medicine and cleaning supplies, and make sure your cabinets are secured with childproof locks. Simple push down brackets can be screwed into cabinets and connected to the door to make cabinets nearly impossible for a baby to open but not be too inconvenient for adults.


Other popular locks use magnets to connect cabinet doors and can be disabled when the baby is not around. Visit your local super center or baby supply store for a selection of baby locks.

, Take extra precautions in the kitchen by moving dangerous kitchen utensils, such as knives and heavy dishes, to higher cabinets where they can’t be reached by a mobile toddler.

, Protect against a hot stove and oven by installing stove knob covers that stop children from accidentally turning on the stove. Most models simply pop on to cover the knobs and can be removed for adult use by opening the hinged front.


Oven locks are also simple to install via an adhesive strip that connects the top of the oven to the oven door, making it nearly impossible for a curious child to open the oven door.

Remove any unsafe items from your yard.,
Install a motion detector in your garage.,
Take precautions if you have a pool.,
Set up an alarm system.",How to Keep Your Child Safe when They Are Learning to Walk4," Do a sweep of outside areas to locate and remove any unsafe items that might be dangerous for a mobile baby.


Items like lawn equipment, toys for older children, and gardening tools should be kept in a locked shed out of the reach of your baby.

, Call your garage door manufacturer to install a motion detector on the garage door to ensure that it will stop closing if it detects the motion of your child nearby.

, If you have a pool, install special exterior baby gates around it and make sure to always monitor your baby when he or she is outside. A fence that is at least four feet tall with gaps no wider than three inches should be installed around the perimeter of the pool. For extra protection, cover the pool with a rigid, motorized cover, as flimsy plastic covers can cave in if a child walks on top.


Pool professionals in your area can recommend specific products and install all of your pool safety needs.

, If your home has an alarm system, set it to chime or beep whenever a door or window is opened. This will help you to intercept an escaping child and prevent disaster before it occurs.

Create behavior rules.",How to Handle a Demanding Preschooler1," Preschoolers, by nature, are often ""demanding"". They need a lot from the adults around them, and they have a difficult time with concepts that older individuals take for granted. Expecting preschoolers to be easily able to delay gratification, consider your wants, or consistently ask politely may lead to frustration on everyone's part.Do not expect your child to change their behaviors immediately. Teaching a preschooler to be patient and polite takes a lot of time and gentle persistence.
Preschoolers have a fuzzy concept of time at best. Expecting them to wait 5 minutes may seem like a long time to them.;
, Remember that your child is still learning to understand abstract concepts like the passage of time.You may need to adjust the way you talk about these concepts so that your child can understand what you are saying and feel less frustrated.


For example, telling a preschooler that they can have something they want “in five minutes” may not be very meaningful to them. Instead, try saying something like, “We can go outside after we put away these dishes.”

, If a young child knows what to expect, they are less likely to get frustrated or make demands.Talk to your child about what to expect ahead of time, and be prepared to repeat yourself several times. A visual reminder may be helpful. For example:


Before going shopping, create a simple grocery list, using drawings or pictures of the things you plan to buy. Let your preschooler help you find the items, and check them off as you go. When the list is completed, the trip is done!
At the breakfast table, write up a picture ""itinerary"" for the child to see what the plan is: breakfast, beach, lunch, nap, go to a parade, have ice cream, go to pool, have dinner, go back to hotel, go to bed.

, Young children have a hard time understanding the difference between something that is necessary and urgent versus a desire. And they need practice to properly ask for needs to be met. Show them the difference between a demand and a request, and why a request is better. Say a few examples and then ask your preschooler for some examples of demands and requests.For example, say, “Let’s say you are hungry. Should you say, 'Mom! I need grapes, go get me grapes!' or, 'Mom, would you please help me with the grapes? I’m hungry.'?”
If your child makes a demand, say, “Can you try that again?” or, “Can you make that a request and not a demand please?”

, Talk with your child and let them know that sometimes the answer will be yes and other times the answer will be no. A “No” is okay, even if the child is upset. Explain that, even if the answer is no, you still love them and want what is best for them.You can say, “I know there are lots of things you want to do, but some will be yes’s and others will be no’s. Even when I tell you 'No,' I still love you.”

, It’s never too early to start teaching manners to children. Explain the power of using the words “please” and “thank you.” Use opportunities for your child to practice their manners and use gentle reminders in the moment.Show how you can add “please” to a request such as, “May I have my teddy bear, please?” Tell your child that this is a much nicer way than saying, “Give me my teddy!”
Model polite manners by using “please” and “thank you” in your own speech. You can also point out when other children are being polite and praise them.

, Help your child understand your expectations for them by having house rules.For example, you may choose to say that you no longer respond to demands, only to requests. If your child makes a demand, redirect them or use a consequence. Having clear expectations can help your preschooler succeed and make meaningful changes to their behavior.


If your child starts a demand, say, “When you make demands, you know you will have a consequence. Do you want to try again or do you want a consequence?”
Say, “When you break a rule, you get a consequence. Talking to me that way means you’re getting a timeout.”

Try having your toddlers sleep together.,
Make your toddlers’ room cozy.,
Make sure the room is safe for your children.,
Get the same bedding and pajamas for your twins.,
Place a baby gate in front of the door.,
Create a routine for your toddlers.,
Put your children to bed.,
Leave your children’s room at the same time each night.,
Tell your children to stay in bed.,
Set limits and only go to your toddlers if absolutely necessary.,
Stay consistent with your children’s bedtime routine.,
Talk about going to bed before it is actually bedtime.,
Give your children a picture book to look over.,
Plan plenty of physical activities each day.,
Make your children’s naps shorter, or get rid of them entirely.",How to Keep Twin Toddlers in Bed," Some toddlers may do well sleeping in the same bed, though they may talk and play until they fall asleep. You can try having your children sleep in the same bed, or you can try having them sleep apart—see which works best for your toddlers.


One downside to having them sleep apart is that they might try to look for each other and delay going to sleep.;
, Part of getting your children to fall asleep easily is creating an atmosphere that is conducive to sleeping. Some ways to make your children’s room cozy is to:


Lower the blinds so that there is less light in the room.
Add a nightlight if your children do not like complete darkness.
Keep noise to a minimum and consider playing soothing music.
Set the temperature to moderate; the room should not be too hot or too cold. This will partly be based on your children’s preferences.

, Before putting your children to bed, pick up or move anything your children could trip on in the night. Put away toys and other items that could distract them from going to bed, or that could be dangerous if played with without your supervision.


Cover all electrical sockets to make sure your children cannot stick their fingers into them.

, Getting your children the same pajamas and bedding will reduce the chances that they will fight over these items when going to bed.

, Your first thought may be to keep your children in their room by closing the door. However, closing the door will keep them from being able to call out to you if they need you. Instead, consider putting a tall baby gate in front of the door so that you can see into the room and can get to your children quickly if need be.

, Try to stick to the same routine each night to make putting your children to bed easier and more efficient. Aspects of the routine to consider include:


Brushing teeth and changing into pajamas.
The time your children are supposed to get into bed.
Whether or not you read a story, sing a lullaby, etc.






Let your children pick one toy to bring to bed with them each night.

, After you have gone through the routine you have created, tuck your children in for a final time, give them kisses, and tell them that you will be nearby if they need you. You should also make it clear that it is time for bed.

, Another part of your nightly routine should be to try to leave the room at the same time each night. Getting into this habit will help your children to recognize that it really is time for bed.


Again, tell them that you will be nearby, but that they should try to go to sleep.

, If your children are having a really hard time staying in bed, set up some consequences for getting out of bed. You can also create rewards for staying in bed all night.


Consequences could be taking away the toy that they brought to bed with them, or telling them that they will not be allowed to watch their favorite TV show the next day if they do not go to bed.
Rewards could be getting to do something fun the next day, like going to the park or getting a treat.

, Your toddlers will most likely cry for the first several nights that they sleep in their room without you. Do not go to your children when they begin to cry; let them adjust to the situation. If you go to them every time they cry, they will get into the habit of crying every night.


If they call out to you, tell them that you are in your own room and that it is time to go to bed.
If they say they need water or to go to the bathroom, only allow them to do this once each night after they have already been tucked in.

, One of the most effective ways to keep your children from getting out of bed is to stick to your established routine. After a couple of days or weeks, your children will adapt to the routine.


Of course, you may still encounter problem nights where your children refuse to fall asleep. This is normal.

, Explain bedtime to your children and why sleeping is important. Talking about going to bed before bedtime may help your children to adjust to the idea of going to sleep.


This may also be a good time to discuss rewards and consequences for staying or not staying in bed.

, You may want to consider giving your children a book that they can look over together. While picture books are engaging, the book will also most likely make your children sleepy.

, Try to tire your children out by doing lots of physical activities with them during the day. The more your children run around, the more likely they will be to very tired by bedtime. Limit the amount of time your children sit in front of the TV because watching TV will not help to release their energy.


Take your children to the park.
Start teaching them sports.
Let your children run around in the backyard.

, Making sure that your children are sleepy by bedtime also involves reducing the amount of naptime they have each day. You can also consider doing away with naptime entirely if your children are particularly energetic.


Turn your children’s nap time into playtime to help them release their energy.

"
Don’t be afraid to say “no.” You may give into your preschooler’s demands for a myriad of reasons: guilt for not spending enough time with them, wanting them to be happy, or giving them what they want.,
Ignore their demands.,
Respond to requests.,
Teach your child not to be demanding in public.,
Prepare ahead of time for difficult situations.,
Expect tantrums.,
Present a united front.,
Get outside help, if you need it.",How to Handle a Demanding Preschooler2," Yet, when you say “No,” you teach your child boundaries and how to handle disappointment. Your child may wonder why they are being denied, so give a brief explanation.Say, “I know you want fast food, but I said no. We are not getting fast food today. We had it yesterday so we are not eating it today.”
Be firm. If your preschooler keeps whining, say, “Whining doesn’t work on me. I said no.”

, If you’ve talked about requests versus demands, and you’ve asked your child to make a request, ignore the demand. Say, “I can’t understand you when you talk to me that way,” or do not say anything at all. Enforce that making demands is not a way to get what they want and it no longer works. However, you are willing to respond to requests.Validate your child’s feelings yet remain firm by saying, “I know you want that, and not having it makes you feel really angry and upset.”Say, “I’m not answering you when you speak like that. I can listen to you if you ask nicely.”

, Give your full attention when your preschooler makes a request. Reinforcing their polite requests will help them behave more positively and be less demanding. Praise their request and answer accordingly, even if the answer is no.Say, “You did a nice job asking for what you want. Thank you. Yes, I will help you tie your shoes.”
You can also say, “Thank you for asking so politely. However, right now we are not going to play, we are going to put away the toys.”

, If the child is making demands in front of others, talk about how this is inappropriate. This can include other adults or the child’s friends. Make a rule that any demands made in front of others will receive an automatic “No.”, Your child may act especially demanding or difficult in certain situations, like at the grocery store or in restaurants. Plan ahead by having a talk with your child about your expectations, and by bringing things to help keep them busy and distracted.For example, if your child becomes demanding on shopping trips, let them know ahead of time that you will not be buying anything extra. Make it clear that you are going to the store for certain items, and you are not buying toys or other items for the child.
If you know your child will be bored, bring along some crayons and a coloring book, a favorite toy, and some healthy snacks.

, If you’re making new changes to your preschooler’s behavior, expect some hiccups before their behavior improves. A child may try to test if you plan to actually enforce your rules. This can result in tantrums or bad behavior at home or in public. Show your child that you are in control and will enforce rules and consequences.Be firm if your child has a tantrum. Say, “You are not getting what you want, no matter how much you scream and yell and kick.”
Stay calm during a tantrum. Getting upset and yelling at your child will not help the situation. If you are in a public place, remove the child to a private area (like your car) if possible, and wait quietly with them until they calm down.

, If you are in a two-parent household, or there are other adults who are helping to parent your child, it is important that you are all consistent in enforcing consequences. If the other parent gives in to the child's demands, this not only allows the behavior to continue, but undermines your parenting. Communicate privately with your partner about how you will handle demands and problem behaviors and be sure to pass this information on to anyone else who might be watching your child.Think about who interacts with the preschooler regularly (such as family members and daycare providers) and clue them in to the changes. Say, “We’ve made some changes to how we respond to their demands. Please do the same.”

, If you’re having a hard time managing your child’s behaviors, talk to a pediatrician or other child care specialist. They may have practical advice to offer, or they may be able to refer you to a child therapist or parent management training specialist who can work with you and your child to foster better behaviors."
"
Enforce rules consistently.,
Set up special one-on-one time.,
Reinforce positive behaviors.,
Try using a reward schedule or calendar.,
Talk about empathy.",How to Handle a Demanding Preschooler3," Once you make a rule, enforce it every time. For example, if you set bedtime at 7:30, have a no-nonsense approach to sending your child to bed once it’s time. A demanding child may insist on staying up later; however, say, “You know the rule: bedtime is at 7:30.”You can also say, “I know you want to stay up later, but it’s time for bed. You might not like it, but this is what’s happening.”
Create a visual schedule for your child to follow. When they start to contest, say, “Look at the schedule. What time is it? That’s right, it’s time for a bath.”

, A demanding preschooler may want your attention throughout the day. Instead of being available at all hours, set up special time for your preschooler (and better, yet, each of your kids) for 15 minutes each day. Give them your full attention during that time and engage in ways that are meaningful to them.If your child is making a demand, say, “I’m busy now, but I’m looking forward to our special time after lunch.”

, A child may become increasingly demanding when they are going unnoticed by their parent and want attention. Catch your child doing positive behaviors and praise them in the act. This can help your child learn to associate positive behaviors with getting positive attention.For example, say, “I noticed you cleaned up your toys as soon as you finished playing with them. Great job!”
Praise you child for using good manners. For example, if your child spontaneously says, “May I please have some juice?” say, “Yes, you may! Thank you for asking nicely and using such good manners!”

, Post the reward schedule where your child can see it. They can use stickers to mark days when they have kept up with the positive behaviors you agreed upon. You can reward your child for being consistently good. If, for instance, they get five stickers during the week, then they get to choose a small toy., If your child makes a demand of you, say, “How would it make you feel if somebody talked to you like that?” Talk about how they want to be treated and in turn, how to treat others.For example, ask, “What would it be like if I interrupted you? Would you like it if I woke you up telling you to make me breakfast?”

Be vigilant if your child has attempted suicide before.,
Consider whether your child has any mental health problems.,
Think about whether your child has been under stress lately.,
Find out whether your child is involved in bullying.,
Question whether your child is struggling with their sexual orientation.,
Notice whether your child seems preoccupied with death.,
Look out for changes in personality and behavior.,
Notice whether your child gives possessions away.,
Pay attention to acts of saying goodbye to loved ones.,
Keep an eye on your child’s sleeping and eating habits.,
Take reckless or self-harming behavior seriously.,
Pay attention to any threats or warnings.,
Express your concern to your child.,
Stay calm.,
Ask questions.,
Help your child get treatment.",How to Know if a Child is at Risk for Suicide," A previous suicide attempt is one of the biggest indicators that a child may try again in the future. Even if your child seems to be doing better now, they are still at risk, so keep an eye on their behavior and ensure they are getting any mental health care they need., Children who have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, a conduct disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are at increased risk for committing suicide. The risk increases even more if a child has co-occurring disorders, or more than one mental health diagnosis.If you think your child may have a mental health disorder, take them to the doctor so they can get a diagnosis and appropriate care.

, A stressful home life can increase a child’s suicide risk. So can difficulties at school or with friends. If your child seems to be struggling to cope with events in their life, keep a close eye on them for other warning signs of depression or suicidal behavior.Factors that increase stress at home include the death of a family member (especially by suicide), a divorce, or abuse.
If your child’s grades are slipping, they talk about not wanting to go to school, or they no longer spend time with their friends, it could signal that they are having problems at school.

, Bullies and their victims are both at increased risk for suicidal behavior. Ask your child whether bullying happens at their school, and keep an eye out for indicators that your child may be a victim or a perpetrator.Victims of bullying may act anxious about going to school, have unexplained injuries, or seem to lose or break their possessions frequently.
Aggressive, quick-tempered children are more likely to be bullies.

, Gay and lesbian young people are at increased risk for having mental health problems and committing suicide. This is particularly true when their family or community is not supportive of their orientation.Take note of your child's media usage and TV/film preferences to look for hints that they aren't sure about their sexual orientation.
You might also start a dialogue with your child about homosexuality by using a scene from a television show or movie. Ask, ""They seem to genuinely care for one another. How do you feel about people of the same gender being in love? Is that something that comes up at school?""

, If your child talks about death, says they want to die, or makes other vague references to death such as “going away,” they may be suicidal. Writing or drawing about death or the afterlife is also a red flag., A suicidal child may start acting in strange or uncharacteristic ways. If your outgoing child becomes withdrawn and quiet, they may be in trouble. Similarly, a cautious child might start acting reckless or defiant if they’re thinking about suicide., If your child starts giving their belongings away, they may be planning suicide. Pay particular attention if they start getting rid of items they previously treasured, or if they say they won’t need their possessions anymore.Start a dialogue by saying, ""Jessie, you gave your lucky baseball glove away to Rob. What made you do that?""

, If your child is thinking about committing suicide, they may say goodbye to friends and family members as if for the last time. They may also arrange to visit loved ones they haven’t seen in a while.Goodbye letters are another major warning sign that your child may be suicidal.

, Kids who are depressed may sleep too much or suffer from insomnia. They might also lose their appetite or overeat, which can cause changes in weight.You might say, ""Joey, you don't seem to have much of an appetite lately. Want to talk to me about that?""

, Suicidal kids and teens may injure themselves or do dangerous things, such as driving recklessly, using drugs, or engaging in unsafe sex. If you find out your child is doing any of these things, seek help for them right away., If your child talks about dying or expresses feelings of hopelessness, talk to them. Don’t brush off their comments or assume they’re just being dramatic.While many of the kids and teens who talk about suicide never attempt it, the risk is too great to ignore. Even if your child doesn’t intend to commit suicide, the fact that they brought it up still indicates that they are in pain and need professional help.
Say, ""You just said that you wanted to die. Are you serious about that?"" If they aren't open to talking, you might add, ""As your parent, I have to take comments like that seriously. If you don't want to talk to me, I think I will set up an appointment for you to see a counselor. How does that sound?""

, Bring up the warning signs you’ve noticed. Let your child know that you care about them and want to help them. If they tell you they’ve been struggling, empathize with them and encourage them to seek professional help.For instance, you could open the conversation by saying, “I’ve noticed that you seem really sad and withdrawn lately, and I’m worried about you. Do you want to talk about anything?”
Let your child know that they don’t have to be ashamed of seeking help. Say something like, “I know it’s hard to believe now, but you don’t have to keep feeling like this. Talking to a therapist will help you feel a lot better.”

, You might feel scared or helpless, but avoid letting your emotions get the better of you when you talk to your child. They will be more likely to open up to you if you stay levelheaded and calm.Avoid making your child feel judged or criticized. This will make them clam up, and it could worsen any feelings of guilt they’re having.

, Guide the conversation and help your child open up by asking gentle questions about how they have been feeling. If your child avoids the topic of suicide, bring it up by saying something like, “Have you been thinking about trying to kill yourself?”Gain further info that can determine how severe your child's suicidal thoughts are. This many include asking ""Have you thought about how you would do that?"" to see if they have an actual plan.

, Take your child to a doctor or counselor for an evaluation, regardless of whether you think they are actually planning suicide or not. If your child admits to planning suicide, take them to the emergency room for immediate help.Do not leave your child alone if you think they are planning to commit suicide.

Use the child seat area only.,
Use the safety belt.,
Keep your child seated at all times.,
Choose child-specific carts.,
Do not place infant carriers on top of the cart.,
Make sure the cart is stable.",How to Keep Your Child Safe in a Shopping Cart1," If you want to place your child in a shopping cart, only use the area in the cart designed for the child. This helps increase your child’s safety. Never let your child ride inside the basket. This may cause the cart to tip over.You should also refrain from letting your child ride on the outside of the cart. This may also cause the cart to tip to one side.
Don’t let your child ride under the shopping cart. Some children like to lie on their stomachs or backs on the shelf beneath the basket. This may lead to your child getting their limbs, hands, or fingers caught in the wheels.;
, Many shopping carts come with a safety belt or harness attached to the seat. This device can help keep your child in the seat and prevent them from climbing or falling out of the cart when you are not looking.Make sure to secure the belt or harness so your child cannot slip out accidentally.
If the cart has a broken or missing belt, choose another cart.

, Your child has a higher likelihood of remaining safe if they sit in the cart at all times. Many shopping cart accidents occur because a child stands up in the seat.When your child stands up, they can fall out of the cart or cause the cart to fall over. Standing changes the distribution of weight and may make the cart tip forward.

, Many stores have special carts made for parents with small children. These carts are designed to be safer for the child by providing an area closer to the ground for the child to ride. If the store offers these carts, choose them instead.Often, these carts have a built-in plastic car attached to the front of the cart for the child to sit and play in.

, Infant carriers or car seats that are placed on top of the cart can make the cart unbalanced and tip to one side. Even if the carrier looks like it will fit or there are clips, you shouldn’t do it. This places your child in a risky place because the carrier is not stable in the child seat of the cart. The carrier can easily fall out.If you need your infant carrier, place it in the large basket of the cart.

, When choosing a cart, make sure to choose a cart that seems in the best working order. Do not choose a cart that has uneven wheels or that wobbles. This can affect the balance of the cart and increase the likelihood of an accident."

Stay with your child at all times.,
Avoid allowing other children to push the cart.,
Shop with someone.",How to Keep Your Child Safe in a Shopping Cart2," Many shopping cart accidents occur because the child is left alone in the cart when the parent steps away to grab something off a shelf. Even turning your back and taking one step away puts your child at risk. Stay with your child at all times while they are in a shopping cart.You should keep your child in your sight at all times. Even if you are standing right next to them, turning so you cannot see your child can put them at risk.
If you need to grab something, move your cart with you so you can stay close to your child and keep an eye on them.

, If you have an older child, don’t let them push the cart when you have a younger child inside. This is unsafe. The older child may run into something, or the cart may tip over with the younger child inside.Always make sure an adult is pushing the cart when there is a child inside.

, If you cannot leave your child at home, consider shopping with another adult who can watch the child. They can stay with the shopping cart or push the child in a stroller while you control the cart."
"
Use your child’s stroller as a cart.,
Let the child walk through the store with you.,
Find alternatives to shopping with your child.",How to Keep Your Child Safe in a Shopping Cart3," Many strollers are large enough to place groceries into. Though you may not be able to buy everything, you may be able to pick up must-needed items and place them in the bottom of the stroller or in the various compartments.When doing this, make sure to be careful how you spread the weight. Try to evenly distribute the items so you don’t tip the stroller to one side.

, If your child is old enough to walk through the store, let them walk alongside you instead of placing them in the cart. This can eliminate any danger with the cart.Make sure not to let the child ride on the side of the cart.
Praise your child for behaving and staying near you while you shop.

, If you can, shop without your child. Leave them at home with a partner, family member, or friend. Some supermarkets or stores offer childcare services that you may be able to use. Drop your child at the store-provided childcare so you can shop undistracted.If a store in your area offers online shopping, try that. Many supermarkets allow you to shop online and pick up your groceries when they fill your order.

Disinfect the handle.,
Cover the handle.,
Wash your child’s hands.",How to Keep Your Child Safe in a Shopping Cart4," Before you place your child in the child seat, take a moment to use a disinfectant wipe on the handle. You may also choose to wipe off the seat, too. Your child will place their hands on the handle, and those hands will automatically go in their mouths. Whatever germs are on the handle will be transferred to your child.Many supermarkets provide disinfectant wipes for you to use. If not, carry your own in your purse or baby bag.
Studies have found that bacteria, including E. Coli and salmonella, can live on shopping cart handles.

, If you want to add extra protection for your child, consider placing something over the handle. This may be a blanket or specific cart seat covering that acts as a barrier between your child and the handle. Seat covers also cover the edges of the cart, which also have germs.This can help keep your child’s hands away from the handle. It also helps reduce the risk that your child will place their mouth on the handle.

, After you take your child out of the shopping cart seat, wash their hands. This helps remove any germs they may have picked up from touching the cart. If you are unable to wash their hands immediately, use hand sanitizer or wipes on their hands before driving away."

You can also make a day of it and take them to a favorite place for lunch, and then go with them to a park or playground afterwards. This will help to create a tradition that they will look forward to every year.


Even if your child wears a school uniform, they can get pumped up about a new school year with fun and colorful notebooks, pencils, and other school supplies.;
, Whether your child is attending a new school this year or is a little nervous about returning to a familiar school, attending an orientation session can help ease their fears. Orientation gives your child – and you – an idea of what to expect during the upcoming school year. It’s also a good chance to meet your child’s teacher.If your child’s school doesn’t offer any orientation sessions, visit the school with your child before school starts and look around. Building familiarity with the school will help your child feel more comfortable on their first day. You can even practice their route with them from the car to their classroom or from class to class to help ease their nerves.

, It’s important for your child to connect with their teacher as early as possible. This is especially true if your child is young and hasn’t spent much time away from parents before. If your child knows and likes their teacher, they will be less likely to feel separation anxiety on the first day of school.If your child’s school does not offer an orientation program, ask if you can stop by briefly before classes start so your child can meet their teacher. Most teachers will be happy to oblige. With your child present, tell the teacher a little bit about your child to facilitate the building of a relationship. Hopefully the teacher will reciprocate and tell you and your child a little about him or herself.

, If your child is worried about certain things happening at school, like being bullied or not knowing anyone in their class, help them manage their fears by role-playing these situations. If your child is having a hard time verbalizing their fears, then try to think of anything traumatic in their past that may be contributing to their concerns.


Give your child examples of things he or she might do or say if these events occurred. By practicing coping strategies in a safe environment, your child will feel less fearful about these scenarios playing out in real life.For example, your child may want to practice introducing him/herself to a new class. Let him or her practice in front of you in order to ease the butterflies that may come on the first day.
You may also want to teach your child some stress-relieving exercises that they can do to help them if hey do become stressed, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation.

, Going back to school can feel a little scary for young children and teens alike. A positive mindset can make a big difference in the way your child processes their stress and handles the first few days of school. Talk to your child about the exciting parts of going back to school, and remind them of all the things they’ll enjoy, such as seeing their friends again.It may also help to help your child create positive affirmations to repeat for going back to school. These may be “This year will be great!” or “I will learn many new and interesting things this year.”
Encourage your child to join you in reminiscing about their favorite parts of school the previous year. Ask them about specific things they enjoyed to get them focusing on all the little the details that they like about school.

, Whether it’s band, theater, or soccer, starting a new extracurricular activity is exciting. Extracurricular activities are a great way for kids to make new friends and develop their skills throughout the school year.


Having a fun new activity to look forward to may help take your child’s mind off their back-to-school nervousness, too., Another way to get your children pumped up about returning to school is to go ahead and start scheduling playdates. Kids may feel anxiety about starting a new school year when they feel out of touch with friends or don't have any friends at their school at all. Reconnecting with their old pals before the start of school, or meeting potential new friends, may help lessen some of the anxiety.


Plan a small back-to-school party or sleepover and invite kids in your child's grade. This is a great way to re-establish old connections, form new ones, and meet other parents., It can be hard for kids to get back into a routine of reading and studying if they haven’t cracked a book open all summer. Help your kids ease back into the academic demands of the school year by encouraging them to maintain a reading habit even when classes aren’t in session.


Aside from priming your child for a new school year, regular reading keeps kids’ minds sharp, making school assignments seem like less of a chore.You can incentivize reading by allowing them to exchange reading time for other things they want to do over the summer, such as taking a trip to the beach, visiting an amusement park, or attending an event.

, Good habits like eating nutritious foods, exercising, and getting enough rest will help your child adapt to the change of going back to school.


Kids who have healthy habits are less likely to feel stressed out during big transitions like returning to the classroom. Getting enough exercise and sleep can also help kids focus better when it’s time to do homework or pay attention in class.Make sure to require that your kids a certain amount of time outside every day. If your children are older, then you can allow them to select their favorite type of exercise and you can help them stick with it. You can also include them in preparing meals to help keep them active.

, After a summer of long, unstructured days, returning to a schedule full of responsibilities can be a jarring change for many kids – and parents, too. Help your child adjust by adding some structure to their routine in the days or weeks leading up to the start of school. Assign your child some chores or reading time every day, and use a planner or a calendar to keep track of upcoming appointments as your schedule starts to fill up again.If your kids have gotten into the habit of staying up late, now is the time to help them ease back into a more school-friendly sleep schedule. Every day, wake your kids up 10 to 15 minutes earlier than the day before, and shift their bedtime by the same amount of time.If your children are older, then you may want to encourage them to hold a part-time job during the summer. This may help them to make the transition to college and/or working later on.

, Completing homework assignments is an essential part of doing well in school. Help your kids get into a good homework routine by setting up a quiet, non-distracting place for them to study. Make sure that pencils, paper, and other materials they’ll need are easily accessible.You will likely need to help them a lot at first, but them gradually dial back your involvement as they get used to having homework.


If your child gets stuck on an assignment or needs help finding resources, assist them in looking things up online or finding materials at the library.Some parents do their children’s homework for them. Do not do this – it doesn’t help your child, and it may hurt their understanding later on. Instead, help your child think about the assignment and come up with their own answers.

, It’s a good idea to make a back-to-school checkup a yearly tradition. A quick visit to the pediatrician can confirm that your child is healthy and ready to start a new year of school. A back-to-school doctor’s visit is also a good opportunity to make sure your child has all the immunizations they need.Some schools require children to have immunizations by a certain age. Check with your local school board to find out their specific requirements.

, If your child has medical issues, food allergies, a learning disability—or any other special circumstances that might require extra attention from the teacher or other school officials—make sure they have this information at the start of the school year. The teacher will appreciate having this knowledge up front. Plus, this allows your child the opportunity to enjoy an optimal learning experience from day one., A new school year brings with it a lot of new responsibilities and things to keep track of. Adopt an organizational system early on to manage all the new information that comes your way. Use a calendar or planner to keep important dates and meetings in one place, and get a special folder or binder to save important papers for reference later.Establish clear communication with your child about their schedule so you don’t end up in a last-minute panic over a meeting or appointment you didn’t know about. Choose a time each week to check in with them about any upcoming projects or events.
Keep in mind that your child’s school may have an online system where you can check on their grades, homework assignments, and upcoming tests. If so, this will make keeping track of what they have going on much easier on you.

, You don’t have to figure out the best way to help your child transition back to school on your own. A wealth of resources exists for parents who want to help their kids get a smooth start to the school year. A good place to start is Edutopia’s back-to-school resource list for parents. This list has advice on a multitude of topics, including health and safety, communicating with teachers, and instilling good study habits.Be aware that study habits are often not taught in school, so you will likely have to take charge of teaching your child how to do this yourself.

Look for underlying issues.,
Consult your child’s physician.,
Follow special advice for infants.",How to Increase Weight in Children1," Some kids, like some adults, are simply naturally slender and have trouble putting on weight. However, you should try to rule out other reasons for your child's difficulty in gaining weight.Children are notorious for being ""picky eaters,"" but if your child simply has little interest in eating, that could be a sign of some sort of medical or psychological issue. A hormonal or metabolic problem such as diabetes or an overactive thyroid can sometimes be the cause of poor weight gain.
Gastrointestinal or other problems may make eating uncomfortable, or undiagnosed food allergies could be at play.
Some medications can reduce appetite, so consider this possibility if your child is on medication.
Unfortunately, even pre-teen children can develop eating disorders due to factors like peer pressure.
Your child could also just be excessively active, and simply be burning more calories than he or she takes in.;
, If your child is receiving regular medical check-ups, the pediatrician may be the one who informs you that your child would benefit from increasing his or her weight. But never be afraid to raise the subject if you are concerned.As mentioned, food intolerances or allergies, digestive problems, and a range of other medical issues can sometimes be the cause of a child being underweight. Your child's physician can help diagnose and treat such problems.
That said, most often the issue can be improved by changes that you and your child can make at home. But the advice of a medical professional is always beneficial.

, Dealing with an infant who needs to gain weight will of course be different from an older child. While serious causes are rare, normally the issue lies in feeding technique, breast milk production, or gastrointestinal problems.Always consult a doctor if you are concerned your infant is underweight. The physician may order tests for your baby or refer you to a feeding specialist (to observe feeding technique) or a pediatric gastroenterologist.
Remedies will vary based on your infant's particular situation, but may include: supplementing breastfeeding with formula (if milk production is insufficient); letting the infant feed as often and for as long as he/she desires (thus avoiding rigid scheduling); changing formula brands (in the case of an intolerance or allergy or increase the calorie content); or introducing solid foods a bit earlier than the typical age of six months. Occasionally medications for acid reflux may be prescribed.
Early life weight gain is essential to long-term health, so shortfalls should always be addressed with appropriate medical advice. Below-average weight gain can almost always be reversed and result in no lasting problems.

Model good behavior for your child.,
Foster empathy in your child.,
Talk to your child about good friend qualities.,
Teach your child about good conversation skills.,
Give your child advice about social interactions.,
Allow your child to go it alone sometimes.",How to Help Your Child Make Friends1," Children look to their parents for guidance about how to behave in social situations. Modeling good social behavior when you interact with acquaintances, friends, family members, and other parents can help your children develop positive social skills.Look for similarities in your likes and dislikes. If you are just getting to know someone, pay attention to what the other person says he or she likes and point out similarities when appropriate. For example, if the person mentions that he or she enjoys swimming and you also like to swim, you might point this out.
Be a good listener. Demonstrate active listening skills for your child by facing the person when he or she is speaking, making eye contact, not interrupting, and acknowledging what the other person has said by making neutral statements, such as “Yes,” “I see,” and “Uh-huh.”;
, Empathy allows us to take the perspective of someone else and consider how that person might be feeling. This is an important skill for healthy friendships because it can help us to be more sensitive to our friends’ feelings and to respond in helpful ways.For example, having empathy can help your child to understand that a classmate who has just lost a pet must be feeling sad. This can help your child to know that she should be extra kind to the person to make her feel a bit better.
You can help your child to develop empathy by asking her questions that encourage her to take the perspective of others. For example, if your child tells you that a classmate was not in school today because her dog died, then you might say, “That’s really sad. How do you think Susie must feel right now?”

, You can also help your child develop good friend qualities by discussing those qualities with your child. Try asking your child questions to help her think about what he wants from his friends.For example, you might ask your child:


What do you look for in a friend?
What traits should a good friend have?
What kind of behavior makes you want to be friends with someone?

, Good conversation skills can help your child to make and keep friends, so you may want to spend some time coaching your child about how to talk to other kids.Some things you may want to teach your child about good conversation skills include:Starting a conversation. Give your child some tips on how to introduce himself to other kids. For example, you might advise your child to pay another child a compliment to break the ice, such as “I like your sneakers.” Or, “You’re really good at tetherball!”
Asking questions to get to know someone. Explain to your child that sometimes you have to ask questions to get a conversation going. For example, you might advise your child to ask getting-to-know-you questions, such as, “What’s your name?” “What games do you like to play?” “What’s your favorite subject?”
Finding similarities. Advise your child to listen and watch for similarities to make it easier to connect with other kids. For example, your child might notice that another child is wearing a t-shirt with a picture of his favorite cartoon character on it. Then, you child could approach the child, compliment the shirt, and mention that he also likes the character.

, Giving your child advice about how to handle certain social situations can help your child to have better social interactions.If your child struggles to approach other kids or join in games, then she might benefit from some advice about how to join in and what to do if she is rejected.For example, if your child wants to join some other kids who are playing, you can advise your child to watch for a few minutes to see what the other kids are doing. Then, when she feels sure that she knows what is going on, she can go over and try to do something along the same lines as what the other kids are doing.
You might also make sure that your child knows not to try to change or stop the game. Just try to join in with the game the other kids are playing.
Tell your child that if the other kids don’t want her to play that she should just leave and find something else to do. Let your child know that trying to force yourself into a group will not work.

, It is great to offer advice and to try to help your child, but keep in mind that sometimes your child will need to be left alone to try things our and learn from her own mistakes. Although it may be hard for you to see this happening, keep in mind that you can use these experiences as learning opportunities.For example, if your child has a negative social experience, you might say, “I noticed that the other kids got upset while you were playing with them. Do you know what they were upset about?” Or, “You did a really great job of sharing your toys with your friends, but I noticed that you did not let them play the way they wanted to play. Do you think that might have upset them a little?”

Feed underweight children more often.,
Make mealtime important.,
Set a good example.,
Encourage regular exercise.",How to Increase Weight in Children2," Many times, the problem is not what a child is eating, but simply how much. Small children have small stomachs and need to eat more frequently than adults.Children may need to eat five or six smaller meals, along with snacks, each day.
Whenever an underweight child feels hungry, feed him or her.

, While sprinkling in snacks as needed, make mealtimes regular focal points in your child’s day. Teach him or her that eating is both important and enjoyable.If mealtime seems like an annoyance or afterthought, or some sort of punishment (such as sitting until you clean your plate), then children are less likely to be enthusiastic eaters.
Make mealtimes a regular routine. Turn off the TV. Make eating and enjoying the focus., While your kid may need to put on a few pounds, you might benefit from losing a few. Even if this is the case, your eating habits should not be as different as you may think. Eating a variety of nutrient-rich foods is essential for the underweight, the overweight, and everyone in between.Children learn by watching you. If you regularly try new foods and make healthy options, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains your first choices, they are more likely to adopt these habits.
Making junk food a rare indulgence will benefit both of you, whether you need to gain or lose weight.

, Like healthy eating, exercise is more often associated with weight loss than weight gain. When paired with smart eating, though, it can be part of a weight-gain regimen.For older children in particular, adding muscle mass is likely to increase weight, and is always healthier than adding body fat.
Exercise can often stimulate the appetite, so try encouraging physical activity before mealtimes and see if that helps.

"
"
Skip unhealthy choices.,
Serve a variety of nutrient-dense foods.,
Utilize healthy fats.,
Select smart snacks.,
Watch what and when your child drinks.",How to Increase Weight in Children3," Yes, cakes, cookies, sodas, and fast food meals have high calorie counts that can increase weight. However, the cost in other potential health problems (including even childhood diabetes or heart disease) outweighs any small benefits.Calorie-rich but nutrient-poor foods, such as sugary drinks, are not the answer to healthy weight gain. Foods that are rich in both calories and nutrients are the best option, because they help add weight and provide essential vitamins and minerals.
Don’t tell your child he or she needs to “fatten up” or “get some meat on those bones” — say that you both need to choose and eat more healthy foods.

, Variety is important not only because it offers the best range of vital nutrients, but also because it helps keep mealtime interesting. If mealtime is a chore or a bore, it will be more difficult to get your kid to want to eat.A high-calorie, high-nutrient diet for weight gain in children should include starchy carbohydrates (pastas, breads, cereals); at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily; proteins (meat, fish, eggs, beans); and dairy products (milk, cheese, etc.).
All children under two should consume full-fat dairy products, and your child’s doctor may recommend continuing this practice past that age to support weight gain.
While fiber is important to a healthy diet, you may not want to overdo it with children trying to gain weight. Too much whole grain pasta or brown rice can leave a child feeling too full for too long.

, We tend to think of fat as bad, but that is not always the case. Many plant-based fats in particular are necessary components of a healthy diet. Healthy fats are also ideal for weight gain because they provide about nine calories per gram, as opposed to about four per gram for carbohydrates or proteins.Flaxseed oil and coconut oil are good choices and can be added to a wide variety of foods. Flaxseed oil has a neutral flavor that can go unnoticed, while coconut oil can add a pleasant sweetness to everything from sauteed vegetables to smoothies.
Olives and olive oil are another good choice.
Nuts and seeds, like almonds and pistachios, provide ample amounts of healthy fats.
Avocados can provide a creamy texture to a range of foods and offer beneficial fats at the same time.

, Children who need to gain weight should be offered regular snacks. But, as with meals, healthy options should be chosen over empty-calorie foods.Focus on high-calorie, high-nutrition, easy to prepare and serve snack options. For instance, try peanut butter and jelly on whole-grain bread; nuts and dried fruit; apples with cheese; or a turkey wrap with avocado.
For treats, present options like bran muffins, granola bars, and yogurt before resorting to cakes, cookies, and ice cream.

, Adequate water intake is important for children, but drinking too much can be filling and reduce the amount of food kids eat.Empty-calorie drinks like soda provide no nutritional value, while the amount of sugar in fruit juices can be bad for teeth and overall health when consumed in excess.
Water is always a good choice, but children who need to gain weight may benefit from drinking whole milk, smoothies or shakes, or even nutritional supplement drinks such as PediaSure or Ensure. Talk to your child’s pediatrician about the best options.
Have your child drink most of his or her beverage after the meal. Skip drinking beforehand, and have him or her drink only enough to comfortably (and safely) eat. This can help keep your child from “filling up” on beverages."
"
Make milk your friend.,
Provide peanut butter.,
Take small steps to add calories.,
Try healthy high-calorie recipes.",How to Increase Weight in Children4," The ease in adding dairy products like milk and cheese to a wide variety of foods makes them great options for enhancing calorie (and nutrient) content.Smoothies and milkshakes are easy ways to help kids drink their calories, and the addition of fresh fruit can further boost the nutrition content.
Cheese can be melted into or sprinkled on top of just about anything, from eggs to salads to steamed veggies.
Try adding milk to canned soups instead of water, and serve sour cream, cream cheese, or yogurt-based dips with fruits or veggies.
You can adapt if your child has an allergy or intolerance, or if you prefer not serving milk products. Soy and almond milks also provide substantial calories and nutrients, and silken tofu can be used in smoothies, for example.

, So long as allergies are not an issue, peanut butter is almost always a welcome addition to a kid’s meal, and provides substantial calories and protein.Slather peanut butter on whole grain breads, bananas, apples, celery, multigrain crackers, and pretzels.
You can also blend it into smoothies and shakes, and use it as a layer of “glue” between two pancakes or French toast squares.
If peanut allergies are an issue, almond butter can be a good alternative. Flaxseeds and flaxseed oil also provide ample calories and nutrients., Simple additions and substitutions can boost nutritious calorie counts in kid-approved foods. Try, for instance:Cooking pasta and rice in chicken broth instead of water.
Serving dried fruit, which children may eat more of because of the lack of water content to fill them up.
Adding flaxseed oil, with its mild flavor, to everything from salad dressings to peanut butter and banana smoothies.
Adding cooked beef or chicken to things like pasta, pizza, soup, stew, scrambled eggs, and macaroni and cheese., The internet if full of recipes suited to increasing weight in children the right way. For instance, an online pamphlet from the UC-Davis Medical Center (http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/cancer/pedresource/pedres_docs/HowHelpChildGainWeight.pdf) includes several kid-friendly recipes, such as fruit dip and a “super shake.”


It also explains how to make high-calorie milk by adding two tablespoons of dry powdered milk to each cup of whole or low-fat milk.
Another helpful article has a recipe for “energy balls,” a treat with dried fruits, nuts, and other goodies that can be stored for long periods and served quickly to hungry kids."
"
Encourage your child to share his or her emotions.,
Help your child prepare before a friend comes to visit.,
Acknowledge your child’s successes.,
Practice authoritative parenting.",How to Help Your Child Make Friends2," Kids who are encouraged to share their emotions tend to have better social skills than those who are not encouraged to share their emotions.It is important to be sympathetic and to be willing to listen when your child has a bad experience trying to fit in with other kids. If your child says she had a bad day at school, ask what happened. Let your child tell you about everything that happened and offer your support.


For example, after your child has finished telling you the story, you can say something like, “I’m sorry you had such a bad experience today. It can be really hard to make new friends.”
After your child finishes telling you what happened, it might be a good idea to find something fun for your child to do to help her feel better. For example, you might ask your child if she would like to go to the park for a while or color in a coloring book.

, Kids sometimes invite school acquaintances over to play and this can help to form a new friendship. To ensure that your kids have the best chance of making a new friend, you may want to spend a little time coaching your child about polite ways to play with someone who is visiting.For example, you might remind your child to be a good host by asking what the guest wants to do first. You might also encourage your child to pay attention to clues that the guest is having fun, such as smiling and laughing.
You can also help your child prepare for a guest by putting out some games or toys that the guest might enjoy. Ask your child to think about what her guest likes to play and choose games and toys based on this knowledge.

, When your child has a successful interaction with another child, make sure that you acknowledge the success and the positive behavior that led to that success. This will help your child to make a connection between the behavior and the social success.


For example, you might say something like, “Your friend has such a good time playing with you today and you did such a good job of sharing your toys!”
You can also acknowledge good behavior to help your child see what might lead to socials success.For example, you might say something like, “You are so good at listening to your sister when she tells you her stories. Do you listen to kids at school with that much patience too?”

, Authoritative parenting is a style of parenting where parents set firm rules and boundaries for their kids and offer explanations why those rules are in place. This is different from authoritarian parenting, which is a style of parenting where parents set harsh rules and expect perfect obedience but do not offer any explanation for the rules or punishments. Kids who are raised by authoritative parents tend to have fewer behavioral issues and better relationships with their peers.Consider your parenting style to determine if there are opportunities to become more authoritative rather than authoritarian. For example, you could make sure that your kids know the reasons behind the rules by sitting down and explaining them. If your kids ask questions, be willing to answer their questions and explain your rules more fully.

Arrange play dates for your child.,
Encourage your child to participate in an after school activity.,
Consider meeting with your child’s teacher.,
Put a stop to bullying.",How to Help Your Child Make Friends3," Arranging play dates for your child can help to provide your child with more chances to socialize and make friends. This may be especially helpful if your child is shy and has a hard time asking other kids to play.Try asking the parent of a child that your child likes to play with at school if you can arrange a play date for your kids. While talking to the other parent, you might say something like, “Susie and Jenny often play together at recess. Susie wanted to know if Jenny would like to come over and play after school on Friday.”

, After school activities can provide your child with more chances to make friends and your child will have the added benefit of already having something in common with the other kids. If your child is interested in an after school activity, encourage him to participate.After school activities can include sports, music, dance, and other activities.

, If your child still has a hard time making friends despite your efforts to help, then you may need to speak with your child’s teacher to find out more about what is going on. Your child’s teacher may be able to work with you to increase your child’s confidence and to encourage her to socialize with her classmates more.Try setting up a meeting with your child’s teacher to discuss your concerns.
Ask about how your child interacts with other kids in school and look for ways to improve your child’s social connections.

, If your child is being bullied, then you will have to intervene and ask for support from your child’s teacher as well. Bullying can cause severe emotional distress that may last into adulthood, so it is important to put a stop to it as soon as possible.Call your child’s teacher right away if you suspect that your child is being bullied in school.
Find ways to keep bullies away from your child outside of school as well. For example, if your child is being bullied on her walk to school, you may want to walk with her for a while or alert the crossing guard.

Childproof your house when your baby is 4 to 5 months old.,
Get on your hands and knees.,
Purchase a playpen.",How to Keep a Crawling Baby Safe1," The average baby begins to crawl at eight months, which means that some babies begin crawling even earlier at six or seven months. By starting early, you will have more time to thoroughly check your house and create a safe environment for your baby when it begins to crawl., Getting on all fours is a great way to see potentially dangerous objects and situations that you wouldn’t have seen otherwise. Go through your house on all fours and make a note of all potential dangers and hazards. Then, make a list of all the materials you will need to child proof your house and go shopping., Because playpens are movable, they are a very convenient way to supervise your baby when moving through different areas of your house. Playpens are also great for supervising your baby when you are busy cleaning and cooking, or if you need time to relax or catch up on work.Purchase a playpen online or at a department store like Babies R’ Us, Sears, Target, or Wal-Mart.
If using a second-hand playpen, thoroughly check it for loose parts and damage before using it.

Install safety gates.,
Use child-guard latches.,
Mount heavy furniture to the wall.,
Secure second-story windows.,
Supervise your baby at all times.",How to Keep a Crawling Baby Safe2," Install safety gates in front of rooms and areas that contain potential hazards like bathrooms, laundry rooms, and older siblings’ rooms. Purchase gates that mount into the wall instead of pressure gates. Pressure gates are ineffective because babies can knock them down if they use them to stand up, or if they push on them too hard.If your house has stairs, make sure to install mounted safety gates at the bottom and top of the stairs.
Also, place screens in front of fireplaces.

, Install child-guard latches on cabinets and drawers that contain objects and materials that are potentially hazardous. For example, install latches on cabinets and drawers that contain household chemicals, medicines/vitamins, toiletries, sharp objects like scissors and knives, and other potentially harmful products and objects.Use trash bins with child-resistant covers.
Fill and unlock one cabinet with baby-safe toys and objects in order to divert your baby from off-limits cabinets.

, Because crawling babies might use large pieces of furniture to stand up, you will want to mount these to the wall. This will prevent large furniture from falling over and injuring your child. Use wall anchors to secure furniture to the wall.You can purchase wall mounts from your local hardware store.
Mount standing bookcases, shelves, cabinets, and other unstable pieces of furniture to the wall.

, Use either window locks or screens to secure these windows. These safety measures will prevent your baby from climbing out of a window.Additionally, secure long chords from drapes and blinds by rolling them up and placing them out of reach.

, A crawling baby needs constant supervision. Being proactive and supervising your baby at all times is the best way to keep it safe. If you cannot supervise your baby, either place it in a secure playpen, its crib, or a swing until you can resume supervising it."
"
Place safety caps in electrical outlets.,
Place breakable objects up high.,
Remove choking hazards.,
Pad sharp corners.,
Use verbal cues.",How to Keep a Crawling Baby Safe3," Also, secure electrical chords to the floor or place them behind furniture to prevent your baby from pulling, swinging, and tripping on them. Secure chords to the floor and sides of the furniture with electrical tape.Secure lamps and other objects that contain chords to the furniture they are sitting on top of with electrical tape or weights.
Place tall lamps that can topple over easily behind furniture.

, Place them on the top level of a shelf or in a high cabinet. Place sharp objects or objects that contain sharp pieces up high in a cabinet, as well. Make sure the shelves you place these objects on are sturdy.Because household cleaners emit toxic vapors, it is also recommended that you place these up high and away from your baby.

, As a general rule of thumb, any object that fits inside a cardboard toilet paper roll should be removed and placed in a secure area. Also, make sure your baby’s toys do not contain beads, eyes, ribbons, buttons and other small pieces that your baby can pull off and choke on.Toys and objects that also have long chords and/or strings, or that are heavy should be removed and secured.
Remove larger objects that contain small pieces that your baby can pull off and choke on as well. Place them up high or in a cabinet with a safety latch.

, Pad the sharp corners and edges of furniture and structures, like fireplaces, with edge guards. You can purchase rubber or plastic edge guards online or from a department store like Babies R’ Us, Target, Sears, or Wal-Mart.Because babies can pull on them, do not place table cloths or place mats on tables and side tables.

, Your child is not too young to understand the word no. Therefore, while supervising your baby, make sure to use verbal cues to indicate which actions and objects are off limits. The more you reinforce this, the sooner and better your baby will understand which behaviors are appropriate and inappropriate.Use verbal cues like “no,” “that’s not yours,” and/or “no touching.""

Ask about child care.",How to Go on Vacation with an Infant," You can take a baby almost anywhere, but you will have a more successful vacation if you select a location with your infant’s needs in mind. In general, you’ll probably want to avoid destinations that are likely to be very loud or very crowded, and you’ll do better if you skip vacations where you are likely to feel pressured to follow a certain itinerary (such as a scheduled sightseeing tour).


Beach vacations can be problematic with very young babies. Take into consideration the fact that infants must be protected from sun (and babies under six months old cannot safely use sunscreen) and should not spend much time in salt water.;
, Once you’ve chosen a destination, you can try to schedule your trip for the best possible time. Ideally, try to go off season, when vacation spots will be less crowded. Factor in the weather conditions, too: your baby will be more comfortable if you avoid extremely hot or extremely cold temperatures.


Generally speaking, you can schedule as long a vacation as you want. If your baby does not tolerate the unfamiliar surroundings well, though, you may decide to shorten your trip.

, When you choose a hotel, motel, or rental property, keep your infant’s needs in mind. You’ll need enough space for all your baby gear, and your baby will need a comfortable place to sleep.


If possible, try to book accommodations that offer a kitchen with a refrigerator. It may cost a bit more, but unless your infant is breastfeeding exclusively, you’ll need a place to store baby food, snacks, juice, and any medications you may have. Having a kitchen sink will also make bottle preparation and clean up much easier.
Look for a place that offers cribs for infants. It’s not completely necessary to have a crib, but if your baby sleeps in one at home, he or she will probably sleep best in one on vacation.
Ideally, you want some distance from crowds. It can be difficult or impossible in a hotel or motel, but your baby will sleep better away from the noise. In addition, if your infant cries at night (as many do, especially in unfamiliar places), you will minimize the possibility that other guests will be disturbed. For this reason (as well as for reasons related to space and kitchen access) rental houses and apartments often work better than hotel rooms.

, Will you take an airplane, car, train, or bus? If you are within driving distance, it is better to take your car: your baby will be familiar with traveling that way, you can stop whenever you want to for feedings and diaper changes, and you won’t risk causing your baby discomfort with the air pressure changes associated with flying. Trains can be better than buses for longer trips because they are more stable; you can walk up and down the aisles with your baby.

, If you are leaving the country, you will need passports for yourselves and also for your baby. This will need to be taken care of well in advance, as the paperwork can take time.

, Bring your infant to the doctor before your trip. A pediatrician can check to make sure that your baby is well and offer you advice for traveling. He or she may have specific guidelines for you to follow if you are taking your baby on an airplane or traveling to a foreign country.

, Remember that you will be walking a lot and carrying your infant a lot, so pack comfortable clothes and shoes, and bring extra: life with an infant is messy, even on vacation.

, Consider the climate at your destination, but pack layers for your baby. It may be warm enough outside for your infant to wear only a onesie and socks, but remember that restaurants, stores, and hotels may be overly air conditioned and chilly. Similarly, it may be chilly outside, but indoor spots may be heated and stuffy. And pack extra, especially if you will not have access to laundry facilities. Babies get messy.

, Depending on the age of your infant and what he or she is eating, you may need a breast pump, formula, bottles, bibs, and baby food.


Do some research before you go, and try to determine what will be available at your destination. You may be able to purchase your baby’s formula and baby food there. Still, bring enough for travel, plus extra – you don’t want to be stranded without the necessary supplies if you wind up stuck in traffic or on a delayed flight.

, You may need these during travel, and once you arrive at your destination, they may come in handy: as extra bedding in a chilly hotel room, as a surface for diaper changes, and as protection from sunlight.

, You may want to limit what you pack, especially if you are flying, but your vacation will be infinitely easier if you have your baby’s car seat and stroller. Consider bringing a sling as well, especially for younger infants – it can be an easy way to carry your baby around with you.


If you haven’t used a sling before but want to bring one, practice with it at home. You will find out right away if your baby hates being in the sling; otherwise, you can get you and your baby accustomed to the feeling, so that it will be natural when you’re on vacation.

, If you are going someplace warm and sunny, you will need to take extra precautions to protect your infant’s delicate skin and eyes. Bring a sunshade, hats, and sunglasses, and, if your baby is older than six months, bring the highest SPF sunscreen you can find.

, If your infant has a favorite toy or sleeps with a particular stuffed animal, bring it along. You want to provide some familiar comforts in an unfamiliar environment.

, These will come in handy for more than diaper changes – you can use them to clean up a messy baby, or you can wipe your baby’s face to help cool off.

, Your pediatrician can recommend medications to bring along for your baby. Depending on your baby’s age and your vacation destination, you may want over-the-counter fever reducers, disinfectants, treatment for insect bites and rashes, and medicine for diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.

, Once you arrive at your destination, unpack, get organized, and designate places for your baby to sleep, play, and eat. Household routines get disrupted on vacation, and that’s okay, but babies do need time and space for eating and sleeping.

, Some routines are going to be negotiable, but your vacation will be more fun and more relaxing if you prioritize your infant’s sleep needs. Try to replicate your usual bedtime routine – if you usually give your baby a bottle, a bath, and a lullaby before bed, do that on vacation as well – and don’t neglect nap times.


If you are traveling with a spouse or partner, you can consider switching off on “nap duty,” with one of you staying with the infant while the other does something fun.

, It’s probably best not to take your baby to fancy restaurants; you will only worry about disturbing other diners or paying a fortune for a meal you don’t get to eat because you are outside consoling a cranky infant. Choose pleasant, casual restaurants with a higher noise level.


Restaurant meals are a big part of vacation fun for many people, but consider doing breakfast and/or lunch in your accommodations, especially if you have a kitchen. This will be much less stressful, and you can plan these meals around a baby’s nap schedule.

, Provided that you protect your infant from the sun, it can be fantastic to enjoy fresh air and sunshine together. And if your baby isn’t sleeping well in a strange crib, he or she may take a better nap in the stroller.

, It’s better to take advantage of your baby’s best moods, whenever they occur, than to try to force a cranky baby on a particular outing at a particular time. Try to be as flexible as possible.

, Some hotels and resorts offer child care or can recommend babysitters. If you’d like a day to swim, sightsee, or do something fun with your significant other, this can be a good option.

Understand the child's temperament.,
Focus on the issues.,
Choose your battles.,
Be sensitive.,
Set boundaries.",How to Handle Difficult Children1," Different children have different personalities. When dealing with a difficult child, it is important to understand what type of child you are dealing with. Is he stubborn? Destructive? Overly emotional? Pay attention to the child's moods, and try to track the factors that seem to trigger difficult episodes.Try keeping a journal of your child's behavior. This will help you recognize certain situations or events that might cause an outburst.
Ask others (teachers, family members, etc) if they have noticed any particular factors that trigger problematic episodes for your child.;
, When your child is having an outburst, take a step back and assess the situation. Part of solving the problem is understanding why it is occurring. Try to understand whether your child is reacting to something specific (such as being denied a privilege) or if she is upset about something else entirely.For younger children especially, they might not be able to tell you exactly what is wrong. For example, they might be hungry, cold, or overly tired, and are exhibiting that by crying about the loss of a toy. Pay attention to the external factors that could be affecting your child's moods.

, Maybe you are fighting every evening about your child's bedtime. Clearly, you need to be the boss, but take a step back and figure out if there is a way to negotiate with your child. If your child is older (around nine or 12 years old), you might realize that letting your child stay up for an extra 15 minutes each night is an easy solution. He will feel more independent, and you will have some peace. For younger children, you might offer him a choice, such as, ""You can choose to go to bed now with a bedtime story, or you can choose to go to bed in 5 minutes with no bedtime story.""


Notice the things that you and your child are fighting over. If you find yourself repeatedly having the same disagreement, focus on fixing that one situation. Solving that conflict might ease other tensions in your relationship.

, Remember that as children develop, they are dealing with a lot of changes and emotions. Unfortunately, they are not always successful in articulating their frustrations, and they end up acting out. Try to be kind and sensitive when dealing with them.


Being kind does not mean that you have to give in to your child's every desire. You can be firm, yet gentle and understanding. Express your rules logically and without yelling.

, Structure is good for children. Setting boundaries for difficult children can help them learn to behave in a more appropriate manner. Make sure that your child understands your household rules, and knows her responsibilities.


Clearly communicate rules to your child. If she is very young, you might have to repeat yourself every day. For example, you might find yourself saying at every meal, ""No, Stacey, it is not okay to throw food.""
If your child is a bit older, try making a rule or chore chart. Being able to visualize responsibilities can help your child retain them. Hopefully, having boundaries will help you avoid future conflicts.
You should also have boundaries for communicating during conflicts. Make sure your child knows that you will not tolerate screaming or any destructive behavior. Make that clear before, during, and after the conflict.

Go over the cafeteria menu together and get input from your child about his likes and dislikes.,
Ask your child what an ideal meal is like and what he would normally choose to eat.,
Plan the menu with your child for the week.,
Refrain from taking away every item that your child likes.,
Inquire about what unhealthy options your child’s school offers as well.",How to Get Your Child to Eat Healthy Lunches at School1,";
, Focus on healthy food choices that he selects and praise him about those selections. Do not speak excessively about his negative food choices. Instead, help him to expand on his good choices and to replace unhealthy options with healthy ones.

, By planning the menu in advance, your child will be less likely to make a rash decision about what to have for lunch and he will be more likely to remember what you told him to eat for that day.

,


Banning all of your child’s favorite foods can actually do more harm than good. Banning foods completely sets the stage for an obsession with those foods, which can lead to your child sneaking those foods and overindulging later on.






Instead of having a strict, no chocolate chip cookie policy, allow him to have those cookies once in a while. By doing this, your child will see that you are not trying to punish him or take away all of his favorite foods.







, It is important to find out if the school offers cookies, ice cream or other treats and when these treats are offered so that you can plan around them.

"
"
Change your perspective.,
Take a deep breath.,
Focus on the positives.,
Don't overreact.",How to Handle Difficult Children2," When dealing with a difficult child, it is completely normal to feel frustrated and angry. Take a moment to step back and remember that it is typical for children to go through difficult phases. You might need to change your perspective. Try to figure out ways to change your reaction, instead of constantly trying to change your child's behavior.Part of your frustration might actually be that you are upset that you are unable to remain calm. Try to learn ways to manage your anger. You might try counting to ten, or saying your next words inside your head before you say them out loud.
This does not mean that you should stop trying to improve your child's behavior. It simply means that you are also part of the equation, and your reactions might need to be changed, too.

, When you are having a conflict with a child, it is very important that you stay calm. Remember, you are the one who is in charge. It is up to you to set a good example.Try to find a calming technique that works for you. Often, taking deep calming breaths is a great way to calm down during an argument. Take deep, slow breaths, until you find your heart rate slowing down a bit.

, During a conflict, it can be difficult to think about anything other than the negative attributes of a child. Try to remember that everyone has positive qualities. Focus on thinking about things that your child does well.When you are having a conflict with your child, try to think of one thing you really love about her. Is she normally very affectionate? Is she doing well in school? Focus on that trait, and you will feel calmer and more capable of dealing with the situation.

, It can be difficult to keep your anger and frustration from reaching the boiling point. However, try to remember that this is just a conflict — you will both move on. Try not to let previous issues or external factors influence your reactions.When trying to keep your emotions in check, try to focus clearly on the situation at hand. Is it really worth it to blow up because your child threw a fit? Probably not. Try to keep calm and find a way to keep the problem from reoccurring.

"
"
Provide feedback.,
Try some time apart.,
Consider contributing factors.,
Involve people you trust.,
Seek professional help.",How to Handle Difficult Children3," One way to help a difficult child learn better behavior is to consistently provide feedback. By letting the child know what is and is not appropriate, you are helping to teach him ways to improve. Make sure that you are consistent in your reactions to certain behaviors or actions.


Provide social feedback. Let your child know how you feel by offering verbal praise or corrections. For example, you might say, ""Thank you for remaining calm today, Tim. I know it was disappointing that it rained and you couldn't go to the park.""
Provide concrete feedback. It can be useful to visually measure your difficult child's behavior. One way is to try a points system. For example, you could make a chart and post points every time your child does something positive (like cleaning her room without being asked). You can detract points for negative behavior. Visualizing the impact of her behavior can help your child learn the benefits of more positive actions.

, If you and your child are continuously experiencing conflict, you might need a little space. Taking a brief time-out can give both you and your child the time needed to calm down and reflect. Some space can go a long way towards solving problems.Ask a close friend or relative to watch your child while you take some time for yourself. It can be emotionally draining to handle a difficult child, so try to take some time each week to do something for yourself. Go to a movie or have dinner with a friend.

, You should consider whether your child is being difficult for a very specific reason. For example, maybe he is not getting enough sleep and is reacting by being difficult. A solution could be that you adjust your child's schedule and make sure that he gets the right amount of rest.There are many other factors that could impact your child's behavior. For example, maybe he is dealing with a health issue that you don't know about. Watch for any signs of physical discomfort, including lack of appetite or change in energy level.

, Remember that you are not alone. Hopefully, you have family and friends who can help you deal with this frustrating situation. Don't be afraid to ask someone you trust for advice.


Your friends and family can help in a couple of different ways. They might be able to communicate well with your child, and you can enlist their help in solving the problem. They might also just be willing to take care of your child for an evening, giving you a much needed break.

, Sometimes your child might need some help that you simply cannot provide. If your child's behavior seems beyond simple acting out, and has been going on for a while, it might be time to contact a mental health specialist. Many therapists specialize in treating youths, and can help you find a way to help your child.Ask your family doctor to recommend a therapist he trusts.
Don't be afraid to ask for help. There is no shame in helping your child live the best life he can.

Brainstorm about healthy food options for your child’s packed lunch.,
Expand on packed lunch staples like peanut butter and jelly.,
Include leftovers from the previous night’s dinner in your child’s lunch, especially if the dinner is one of your child’s favorites.

",How to Get Your Child to Eat Healthy Lunches at School2," Be sure to include your child in the brainstorming process.

, Think outside the box and get creative with the meals you pack.


Replace 2 slices of bread with a pita or tortilla wrap when making sandwiches.






Pack breakfast foods or other non-traditional lunch items.






Offer a bunch of healthy items instead of just a sandwich and a snack. As long as your child is receiving all of the nutrients he needs, his lunch does not have to consist of a traditional meal. Instead, offer a lunchbox full of healthy snacks, such as some fruit, a handful of healthy cereal, a homemade trail mix, carrots and dip, cheese slices, etc.

Pack your lunches with your child if you work outside of the home.,
Plan ahead if you will be eating out for lunch on the same day that your child will be purchasing food at school.,
Keep healthy food options in the house and make them visible to your child.",How to Get Your Child to Eat Healthy Lunches at School3," This allows him to observe your healthy eating choices. Model good food choices and choose foods for yourself that you would encourage your child to eat. Don’t pack yourself a soda if you would ask your child to drink milk.

, Decide where you will go for lunch and what foods you will eat. Discuss your lunch options with your child and encourage him to select similar healthy foods for his meal. Let your child have some say in his lunch options just as you had say in yours.

,


Limit unhealthy foods. If your family enjoys cookies or other treats, offer them only occasionally. Some families choose one day during the weekend to be more lax with eating habits. Others select one night during the week to do a family fun night, during which time they allow special treats. This method teaches your child that unhealthy food options, though not off limits, are allowed only once in a while. Your child will likely come to recognize them as specialty foods and will quickly understand that they are not every day staples.






Don’t store cookies and chips where you and your child can just grab them at any time. Unhealthy treats like that should be stored in a place where you can access them only when needed. Instead, provide easy access to healthier snack options. One way to do this is to put a basket of fruit on your kitchen counter, or to keep a bowl of cut up vegetables in the refrigerator.







"
"
Let your child know that you are not trying to police what he eats and that eating healthy is not a punishment.,
Let your child know that eating healthy also helps his mind and will help him to perform better in school.",How to Get Your Child to Eat Healthy Lunches at School4," Teach him that eating healthy is important, not just to his body now, but to his body later in life.

, Inform him that if he eats a huge lunch that is full of fatty foods, he will be tired in the afternoon and unable to focus on his school work and after school activities.

Take care of your childrens' needs first.,
Go through your regular good-night rituals at the childrens' usual bedtime after dinner.,
Set up a baby monitor and keep it near you.",How to Have a Date Night at Home with Small Children1," It might be helpful to do an exciting afternoon activity with them that will make them comfortably tired, such as playing on a playground or at a park. Enlist help for this if necessary, so that you are not ready to crash by 6:30 p.m. Don't feed your children treats very high in sugar in the afternoon. If they usually have a sweet snack, give it to them as dessert during lunch and pick a different snack for the afternoon.;
, Don't get stressed out and rile them up by trying to rush them to bed, being short with them, or yelling at them. If you usually give them a bath every night or read them a story/sing/hold their hand, do so tonight as well. It will help them feel safe and secure and encourage them to go to sleep.

, Respond to your children if they need you. Assuming that none of them are ill, everything should be pretty peaceful at this point.

"
"
Decide in advance what you would like to do.,
Carry out your preparations.,
If your partner does not live with you, have them come to your house after the children are asleep, unless they are usually part of the evening rituals.,
Prepare and/or serve your food.",How to Have a Date Night at Home with Small Children2," Options include watching a movie, slow dancing to (low-volume) music, giving back rubs or foot rubs, or maybe even taking a bath together if you are in an intimate relationship and have a bathtub. If you want to share dinner and a movie, consider ordering food in to cut down on your expended energy. Pick a movie in advance if you have to rent it outside your home, or choose it spontaneously if you have access to online services like Amazon Instant Video or Netflix.

,  If you would rather cook an elaborate dinner and eat it by candlelight, try to either shop for the ingredients in advance or enlist help to get everything together. Some grocery stores deliver. Alternately, you could decide to make something that consists mostly of ingredients you already have or combine ready-made elements. Try not to create too much noise while cooking to avoid disturbing the children.

, If your partner visits only occasionally, having them around while you are getting the children ready for bed might keep the children up. Arrange for them to have a key or call your phone or text when they get to your house, as to not wake the children.

, Whether you prefer to eat on the couch or at a nicely set table, now is the time. Enjoy your meal together.

"
"
If you and your partner want to watch a movie, make sure that the children will not be disturbed.,
If you'd like to share a dance with your partner, find a suitable space in your apartment and put on some music you enjoy.,
If you want to run a bubble bath for both of you, try to use a bathroom not directly adjacent to your children's bedroom.,
If you intend to make out or indulge in other amorous activities, do so in a place that your children will not accidentally walk in on.",How to Have a Date Night at Home with Small Children3," Don't turn the sound up too high and avoid movies with sudden blasts of sound, such as action movies with lots of explosions.

, Slow music might fit the romantic mood and be unlikely to wake the children. If, for example, the only place to dance is in the kitchen, consider using a cell phone to play music, if your phone provides this feature, or a radio.

, They will hear the water running through the wall and your voices might be amplified by the tiled bathroom walls.

, Bring the baby monitor with you and interrupt your romantic time, if necessary, if your child needs attention. Do NOT under any circumstances lock your children in their rooms. Lock your bedroom door instead if you need privacy.

Watch for symptoms of emotional abuse.,
Look for symptoms of sexual abuse.,
Identify signs of neglect.,
Watch for any behavioral changes.,
Consider changes in the child’s social interactions.,
Watch for any changes in the child's general mood.,
Notice changes in school attendance or performance.A child who is being abused or neglected may frequently be late to class or miss school entirely, and may have trouble focusing on classes.,
Look for self-destructive behaviors.,
Realize that it may not be obvious.,
Check for physical health problems.,
Pay attention to mental health problems.,
Consider criminal history and violent behavior.,
Look for social disconnection or isolation.While some people are natural loners and may not prefer to socialize much, someone who was abused as a child may be more likely to reject social advances from others, have a history of broken relationships (such as divorce or breakup of significant relationships), or be unmarried and live alone.,
Watch for abnormal stress responses.,
Know when to call for help.,
Learn about the different types of child abuse.,
Understand misconceptions about child abuse.,
Research the effects of abuse on children.",How to Identify a Victim of Child Abuse," Physical abuse may be easy to spot if the child has no way of concealing the injury, but there are also some more subtle signs. Common symptoms of physical abuse include:Having injuries such as bruises, cuts, or burns that the child either cannot or will not explain
Having injuries that are patterned (such as looking like the injury is from a belt)
Acting anxious or always on guard
Flinching at sudden touch or movement, and may be averse to being touched
Showing signs of discomfort when movingWearing inappropriate clothing to cover arms and legs, such as long sleeves on hot days;
, Emotional abuse can be difficult to spot, as it doesn't leave physical markings; however, it is extremely important to keep an eye out for. Some symptoms of emotional abuse include:Having low self-esteem or self-confidence
Seeking affection from others
Being distrustful or fearful
Having trouble with emotional regulationStruggling with social interactionActing older or younger than is appropriate for the child’s age, such as thumb sucking or taking on care of other children, Sexual abuse can cause severe emotional problems for a child that may last for his or her lifetime. Children who are sexually abused often feel like the abuse is their fault, and many children are ashamed to come forward.Some signs of sexual abuse include:Sexual knowledge or actions that don't match the child's age group
Trouble walking or sitting down
Unwillingness to change clothing in front of others
Fear of certain places or peoplePregnancy in adolescent females

, Neglect is when a child’s basic needs are not being met, such as food, clothing, hygiene, and affection. Neglect can be difficult to notice, or it can be obvious. Signs of neglect may include:Consistent uncleanliness, including body odor
Lack of weather-appropriate clothing
Requests for food or other necessities, and hoarding these when possible
Being underweight or malnourished
Having untreated physical or psychological problems, Most children exhibit behavioral changes under stress, so it's a good idea to look for changes in behavior when attempting to identify a victim of child abuse. However, keep in mind that these symptoms can apply to a child under stress that isn't related to abuse; don't assume that just because you see these symptoms, they're being abused.


In older children, you may see behavioral regression. Behavioral regression is when a child reverts back to old behaviors that they did when they were younger. Examples include thumb-sucking, bedwetting, and emotional problems such as throwing tantrums.
Notice changes in eating habits. Does the child eat much more than he or she used to, or does the child seem less interested in food? Is the child gaining or losing weight?
Is the child scared of a certain person or group of people? It's normal for children to be afraid of some people, such as those who may look frightening, but if the child seems to be scared of an older child, a group of children, an adult, or a group of adults, then the child may be being abused.
Is the child vandalizing property or stealing? Sometimes, children may be stealing out of necessity, such as if they are being neglected. Pay attention to what the child takes because taking food or money can be a sign of neglect., If the child loses friends rapidly, withdraws from social activities, suddenly closes off from trusted friends, or begins spending all their time with an older child or adult, these may be indicators that the child is being abused. Keep an eye out for aggressive behavior as well. Children who are being abused may start fights, whether verbal or physical.Try to find out why the child's friends are no longer spending time with the child. If the friends describe the child as becoming secretive, moody, or devoting all of his or her time to another person, take a closer look at the situation.
If the child didn't have many friends to begin with, watch for signs of bullying. Bullying can contribute to symptoms of abuse, but the child may be being abused as well.

, A child who is being abused can become anxious, jumpy, depressed, angry, or show a combination of emotions.Children who have been emotionally abused may also have trouble controlling their emotions and have large breakdowns or emotional outbursts that may frighten other children.

, The child’s grades may also drop. However, don't assume that a child with great grades isn't having home trouble. A child can be abused and still keep up with schoolwork - and keeping up with schoolwork may be forced by the abuser.

, In some cases of child abuse, the child may resort to self-destructive behaviors or may even become suicidal.If the child has admitted to you that he or she engages in self-destructive behaviors, seek help for the child immediately. Self-destructive behaviors include:


Self-injury, such as cutting or burning
Suicidal thoughts or intentions
Drug or alcohol abuse
Intents or threats to harm others

, If you know an adult who you suspect has been abused during childhood, recognize that most adults are not willing to talk about it. An adult who has been abused during childhood may be secretive about his or her past. It will be necessary to take a closer look at the adult in question unless he or she trusts you enough to tell you.

, Child abuse has been linked to increased risk of physical health problems, though it is uncertain why this is.Adults who were abused in childhood are at a higher risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, liver problems, hepatitis, arthritis, and more.Be aware, however, that physical health problems can occur in people who haven't been abused, so it shouldn't be your sole piece of evidence.


Don't ignore smaller problems such as headaches or stomach pain. While these may seem too common to be a symptom of past abuse, if they are occurring frequently, it may be the body's stress response.

, Victims of child abuse may have trouble regulating or feeling their emotions.They may develop or suffer from mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, and personality disorders.Research has shown that children who are abused are more likely to develop depression or PTSD than children who weren't abused.


Adults who were victims of child abuse are more likely to engage in self-injurious behaviors or attempt suicide than those who weren't.Eating disorders can also be a sign of an abusive past.
Be aware that most people aren't going to open up about their mental health to you, especially if you don't know the person well.
Do not confront this person over his or her behavior unless you have reason to believe that he or she is suicidal. If the person is showing symptoms of depression, though, you may still want to reach out and offer your support. Even if you have reason to believe that this person is suicidal, be careful about how you talk to them about it.

, Victims of child abuse are more likely to engage in violent and criminal behavior than those who are not victims.If this person has a history of cruelty towards people, animals, getting arrested, and abusive behavior towards their partner or spouse, they may have been a victim of child abuse.


Child abuse has also been linked to development of personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder.However, it is important to remember that someone's past does not justify their current actions; it merely serves as an explanation for why the person has certain behaviors.

, Keep in mind, however, that just because someone rejects social advances does not necessarily mean he or she was abused. Other mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, can cause a person to go into social isolation.

, Abuse has been proven to cause abnormal stress responses - more specifically, the level of cortisol released in the brain is less than usual.Victims of child abuse can develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or even PTSD itself; one of these symptoms is hyperarousal, or fight-or-flight mode. Symptoms of hyperarousal include:Sleep disturbances, such as insomnia or nightmares - the affected person in question may be constantly tired
Irritability, anger, or aggression
Impulsiveness
Constantly feeling unsafe

, While you can't go back in time and get the person out of their past abusive situation, you may be able to help the person recover in adulthood or intervene if the person is suicidal. Keep an eye out for any signs of suicidal intent, abuse of alcohol or drugs, extreme self-injurious or reckless behavior, or violence towards other people.


If the adult who is a victim of child abuse has stated that he or she intends to commit suicide or harm others, contact emergency services immediately and try to distract the person until help arrives. Avoid leaving the person alone.

, The term child abuse is often used to cover many different types of abuse. In order to truly identify a victim of child abuse, you will need to understand the types of child abuse and where it comes from.Physical abuse is abuse involving physical actions such as slapping, kicking, pushing, hair-pulling, choking, and more.

Emotional abuse is abuse involving emotional manipulation, threats, and put-downs - for example, a parent telling his or her child that the child is worthless and threatening to kick the child out.

Sexual abuse is abuse of a sexual nature, such as rape, sexual touching, or taking pornographic photos of the child.

Neglect is abuse involving a lack of care for the child. A neglected child may have poor hygiene and ill-fitting clothing and seem to be constantly unsupervised.

, To identify a child that has been abused, you might have to dispel certain misconceptions about child abuse. Common misconceptions include:Child abuse is only violent or Physical abuse is more severe: Victims of child abuse who were emotionally abused or neglected can carry the memories of abuse for as long as those who are physically abused. No form of abuse is ""worse"" than another form.

Children lie about being abused: Many statistics, such as police and court statistics, show that it is very rare for children to claim that they have been abused when they haven't. It has also been found that it is more common for children to say that they aren't being abused when they really are.They did something to deserve it: While parents do have to set rules and sometimes enforce them for their child, a parent who abuses his or her child is the one at fault, not the child. Even if the child has been severely misbehaving, the parent's job is not to hit, threaten, or belittle them. A child who has been dressing ""older than his or her age"" isn't responsible for sexual abuse, a child who has been misbehaving isn't responsible for physical abuse, and a child who is emotional towards their parents isn't responsible for emotional abuse.

Disabled children aren't at risk for abuse: Researchers have proved that disabled children are actually at a higher risk for abuse than children without disabilities.For this reason, it's a good idea to keep an eye on disabled children and watch for signs that they may be being abused.

Children who are abused should be removed from the home: In cases of child abuse, the child is only removed from the home by child protective services if keeping the child at home would be dangerous, as removing a child from his or her home can distress the child. Most of the time, the child is kept at home while outside help is provided for the family.

Sexual abuse is done by strangers: Sexual abuse of a child is not limited to strangers. Most children who are sexually abused are abused by people that they know.

, Children who are abused are often found to suffer from adverse effects, such as increased risk of substance abuse, physical health problems, mental health problems, and problems with interpersonal relationships.If you suspect a child is being abused, do not blow off the situation; child abuse has been proven to cause problems that can extend well into adulthood.


Children who have been abused have a heightened risk of self-harming behaviors as well as suicidal thinking. Other effects of child abuse are depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), personality disorders, eating disorders, and dissociative disorders.Not getting help for an abused child can result in severe problems for the child later on in life.

Start reading to your children early.,
Read to your children every day.,
Talk with your children a lot.,
Keep a lot of books in your house.,
Communicate with educators and teachers.,
Practice writing with your child.,
Cut down on television.",How to Help Your Child Be a Better Reader," Read out loud to your children even when they are infants. It will start a good habit, and your children will become accustomed to hearing stories out loud.;
, The United States Department of Education recommends reading to your children for at least 30 minutes every day.


Help your children read with you by asking them to point out pictures in the story, or by identifying letters and words they might know.
Read with your child if he or she already knows how to read. Early readers love to read out loud to people. Help with any words that are unknown and ask questions about the story when you are finished.

, Use short simple sentences before your children can read or talk. As their vocabularies grow, use more advanced words and longer sentences.

, Make sure there are plenty of children's books for your kids to read, and visit the library regularly to check out new books.


Let your kids get their own library cards or memberships. This will give them a feeling of independence, and will make checking out their own books exciting.
Spend some time at the library when you visit. Let your children use the computers and look at magazines. Feeling comfortable in the library will help them enjoy being around books and reading materials.

, Your child will begin learning how to read as soon as school is started. Keep in touch with teachers, reading specialists and other administrators about your child's development and reading skills.


Visit the classroom when you are permitted, to see how your child is doing. Volunteer to read stories to the class and participate as often as you can.
Ask about additional resources that can be used at home. Teachers may have access to good websites and other materials that will help you encourage your children to read.
Address any developmental delays immediately. Talk to your child's teacher about special programs or tutors you may be able to take advantage of. Continue to read to your child if he or she is struggling to learn the skill.

, Reading and writing skills go hand in hand. Make sure your child has paper, pencils and other writing materials available. Help him or her write words, sentences and simple stories.

, Restricting the amount of time your child spends in front of the television will give them more time for reading.

Decide on a suitable night for the in-home date.,
Plan for the date night.,
Shop ahead of time for the things you need.,
Make as much of the meal ahead of time as possible.,
Clean the house the day before.,
Prepare for the date night.,
Get the kids to bed as early as is reasonable.,
Dress for date night.,
Begin date night when the kids are safely tucked up.,
Sleep in if you can.",How to Have a Date Night in with Kids Still in the House," This might be a weeknight or a weekend, depending on your work schedule or preferences. The weekend may have the added benefit of being able to sleep in the next day, depending on your lifestyle.


Set the date aside so that it takes on significance for both of you. Ring it on the calendar. This will signify that the date is all systems go.;
, Decide what you'll have for dinner, whether you'll watch a movie together, play a game or perhaps go skinny-dipping in your pool. Choose something fun that brings you together. You can also plan for romance in the bedroom later, with satin sheets, rose petals and champagne.


Consider whether or not it's worth getting a babysitter. This will depend on the size of your home, your budget and how you feel about having another person around on date night, but it might be a solution if you're concerned about interruptions during the date. Explain to the babysitter that you're having a date night at home and that it isn't to be interrupted apart from emergencies.
Do you have a special area in the garden, such as a gazebo, a studio or similar, where you could go for a special evening outside? If the weather is good, spending the date night outside can be a great way to escape the kids and you can use apps on your cellphone to act as monitors on the kids, if you're worried.

, This includes the groceries, scented candles, rose petals, a DVD/new game, new clothes/lingerie and so forth. This is part of the build-up for the evening, so indulge.


Make a list together and divide off who gets what and by when.

, Try to choose recipes that can be baked or made ahead and simply heated up. It's not a lot of fun cooking intensely on date night, unless that's the very activity both of you love.


Another alternative is to order in your favorite take-out, no expenses spared. If your favorite restaurant delivers, order ahead of time (including any special requests), to ensure that a three-course meal will be dropped off at your door, ready to enjoy.

, This will help you to feel less inclined to spend the day before your date night cleaning and wearing yourself out. Of course, there will still be kid's messes to clear up but they can help in many cases, or you can ask them to play in rooms where you can just shut the door.

, On the day of date night, set up all the things in readiness for the date that can be set up, such as setting a romantic table, strewing cushions and throw rugs in the gazebo, placing candles out, and so forth. If your children are curious, tell them it's something special for mom and dad later. If they're likely to mess it up because they're too young to know any better, hold off until later.


Consider making the most of what the kids leave behind. For example, if they've built a fort, crawl inside and watch a DVD in there together.

, Get feeding, bathing and bedtime stories sorted nice and early. This is where a babysitter may come in handy, even if she or he does this part, then leaves, as it gives you the space and time to set up your date night. (If your children tend to go to bed late, a babysitter may well be a very good investment.)

, Dress up and discard your at-home clothes. You can keep it comfortable by opting for formal casual rather than opulent evening wear but that's entirely up to you.

, Turn on monitors if needed, otherwise, simply begin the date as if you were really doing something special. Have a lovely meal together, by candlelight or moonlight. Snuggle up somewhere and watch a movie, stargaze, simply talk or make out under the stars. Take a dip in the pool or hot tub. Have some nice wine or champagne, accompanied by delicious chocolate truffles. Dance to your favorite songs. Look for night birds. Have a wine, cheese or chocolate tasting session. Give each other a massage. Tell one another what you mean to each other. And so forth.


Play some romantic music in the background. Select the playlist well in advance and let it play uninterrupted.

, Keep the dream going just a little longer, until little people are jumping up and down on your bed, demanding full attention again.

Teach labeling through touch.,
Read together.,
Give your child words for feelings.,
Talk about color.",How to Teach Your Blind or Visually Impaired Child to Talk1," Young children learn to speak through identifying objects. Start with objects that are easy to identify and your child enjoys, like a ball. Allow your child to touch it and feel it. Say the word as they feel it. Have them touch it and feel it as long as they are interested in the object.For example, say, ‘Do you want your ball? That’s a ball. You’re touching a ball.”;
, Reading can help your child learn new words and concepts. Listening to stories over and over again can help build vocabulary skills and can help your child learn to anticipate new words. It can also help them understand the structure of stories, which will help them with reading and writing in the future.Use tactile books that provide interesting textures and activities for your child to explore. This might include things to pull, put together, or move.
Find books and stories that interest your child and keep their attention. Don’t be afraid to re-read books again and again, as this can help them develop better language skills.

, Start to introduce feelings words when your child is frustrated, mad, happy, sad, etc. if your child is frustrated, label their feeling and let them know that you see that they’re upset. Let them know what they can do when they have these feelings, too.Say, “You feel angry. Yes, I can tell because you are yelling and shaking your fists.”
Teach your child words to get your attention when they need help. For example, they can say, “Help” or “Sad.”

, It can be difficult to teach a blind child about color. You don’t have to make color a taboo subject, yet don’t over-emphasize it either. It’s important to teach your child colors of objects, especially their own things. If your child loses their backpack, for example, the first question someone might ask is, “What color is it?”Teach color to your child by making comparisons to high and low tones in music. For example, say, “There are lots of colors, just like there are lots of notes on a piano. Some colors are soft while others are loud. Just like you can play the same note in a different octave, different colors can have different shades.”

"
"
Use language in all experiences.,
Address echolalia.,
Help with pronouns.,
Curb excessive questioning.,
Accept your child’s learning.,
Address speech delays.",How to Teach Your Blind or Visually Impaired Child to Talk2," Speak to your child as much as possible. Talk to your child throughout the day and tell them what is going on and what they are going to do next. Narrate simple activities like changing a diaper or eating a meal.For example, say, “Now we are changing your diaper. Up you go on the changing pad. Ok, let’s take off your pants and get rid of your stinky diaper. Off it goes! Now we are wiping your bum so it’s nice and clean. On with the new diaper and we’re just about done! Here are your pants and you’re all set.”

, Some blind children may repeat things that were just said or say things you’ve heard previously in relation to a familiar topic. Echolalia is a common phase for babies, and especially for blind babies. To help build their skills, use concrete experiences to help solidify words and meaning for your child. While echolalia does pass, you can help your child respond better.For example, if you ask a question and your child repeats it, model how to respond. If you ask, “Would you like to read a book?” and your child repeats it, follow up by saying, “Yes, I would like a book, please.”

, It can be hard for a blind child to understand the words you, me, he, she, etc. If your child is struggling, make some changes to your own speech. For example, instead of saying, “I’m going to make breakfast” say, “Daddy is going to make breakfast.” This simplified speech can help your child recognize who is talking and who is involved.Use your child’s name instead of saying ‘you.’ Say, “Did Ariel put on her jacket?” or, “Can Rafael come to the dinner table, please?” This helps them visualize objects and people better rather than trying to relate to vague commands or concepts.

, Blind children often ask excessive questions as a way to stay engaged or make sure someone is still nearby. However, excessive questioning is often socially inappropriate. If your child asks excessive questions, gently know that it’s not appropriate. If your child wants assurance that you are there, have them express their feelings instead of asking questions.For example, they can say, “I want to make sure you haven’t left,” or, “Please don’t leave without saying goodbye.”

, Some toddlers gain language in spurts while others show slow and steady gains. Some children learn words one by one while others put phrases together more quickly. Whatever your child’s abilities, recognize that differences are normal and okay.Some blind children may experience some speech delays. Keep watch for things that make your child very different from their peers.

, If you’re wondering if your child is delayed in speech, get an evaluation. Your child may qualify for speech therapy services. If your child isn’t speaking or is speaking minimally by age three, you may want to see a speech expert. Some problems to look out for include confusing gender, mispronouncing vowels, and only speaking in one-word answers.Talk to your child’s pediatrician if you have concerns. If your child is in school, talk with their teacher or school psychologist.

Recognize the benefits of sign language.,
Simplify signs.,
Use repetition.,
Start with items your child loves.",How to Teach Your Blind or Visually Impaired Child to Talk3," Many sighted children learn and express multiple signs before speaking. If your child is struggling to communicate, signing can help them communicate what they want. It can help facilitate language skills and connect sign to spoken word.For blind children, sign can help with body awareness. It can also help teach your child that gestures and body language are a part of communication.

, You don’t need to teach your child proper sign language. Your baby has tiny hands and is still learning fine motor coordination. If the sign is difficult, find a way to simplify it. If your child modifies a sign, let them do it their way.If your child is trying to sign something, pay close attention as they may not sign it exactly.
Praise when they start to sign on their own, even if it’s an approximation.

, Your child will likely not start using or understanding the signs at first. Make sure you repeat the spoken word and the sign each time your child comes in contact with an object and use lots of repetition. Each time your baby comes in contact with the item, say and sign the word for them.When signing an item for your child, make the sign for them and repeat it. Repetition will help reinforce the connection between a sign and an object.

, When choosing what signs to teach your child, think about what is important and meaningful to them. You want your child to sign what their wants or needs are. Don’t focus on teaching manners (like “please” and “thank you”) at first, just focus on helping your child express their needs and feelings.For example, if you child loves crackers, teach them the sign for cracker. If your child loves their toy ball, teach the sign for ball.
You can also teach simple signs like “more” or “all done.”

Understand what causes Apert syndrome.,
Consider what the term ‘syndrome’ refers to.,
Be aware that the most common symptom is a malformed skull.,
Understand that one symptom is that the eye bones are formed high or far apart.,
Know that another symptom is having ears that are lower on the head.,
Be aware that the child’s nose might have a flat bridge.,
Know that cleft palate is a symptom of this condition.,
Understand that Apert syndrome also causes a fusing of the fingers and toes.,
Be aware that someone with this syndrome may have challenges with mental capacity.",How to Treat a Child with Apert Syndrome1," While scientists are still studying this condition, there are several known reasons why a child is born with Apert syndrome.These reasons include:


Genetics. A parent can pass this condition onto his or her child, even if the partner does not carry the gene. A person who has Apert syndrome has a 50% chance of passing the gene on to his or her child.
Spontaneous occurrence: Sometimes, a child will be born with Apert syndrome, even if neither parent carries the gene. A defect in one of the baby’s chromosome can lead to Apert syndrome.;
, The term ‘syndrome’ means that there is a group of symptoms that consistently show up together. For this reason, one person with Apert syndrome may have a combination of symptoms, while another person may have a different combination of symptoms, but they both have Apert syndrome.For example, one child with this syndrome might have a malformed skull, a cleft palate, and shallow eyes sockets. Another child with the same syndrome might have a malformed skull, low-set ears, and a flat nose bridge. Yet, both of these children have the same syndrome.

, This is also referred to as a ‘peaked head’. This happens because the sutures (bands of tissue that connect the bones of the skull) in the skull close up too early, creating ridges along the suture lines. The top most part of the skull bulges because the closed sutures put extra pressure on the child’s brain.When the sutures fuse too early, it can impede the development of the child’s brain.
Sometimes, the early fusing of the sutures only happens on one side of the skull. When this happens, the forehead on the affected side will appear flattened, while the unaffected side will be a normal shape.

, The skull also has lines inside the fact that can be affected by this syndrome. If they are affected, the bones in the face can move upward on the head. This causes the child’s eye sockets to become very shallow.When the eye sockets become shallow, the child’s eyes will look like they are bulging outward. It is not that the child’s eyes are any larger than another child’s eyes, they simply less have space in the head. This exposure of the eyes can lead to the child getting frequent eye infections.

, While a person with this syndrome’s ears may be shaped and sized normally, they may be placed lower on the head, closer to the jawbone and more forward on the head.


This displacement of the ears can lead to hearing troubles.

, A child with Apert syndrome might have a smaller nose that has a flat bridge. This is because the nose bones fuse together before they get a chance to form fully, leading to a smaller than average nose.

, A cleft palate is when the roof of the mouth doesn’t get a chance to fuse all the way because the syndrome causes the bones to fuse together prematurely. A cleft palate can be accompanied by crowding of the teeth or an inability for the teeth to fully form., During a baby’s development inside the womb, the fingers and toes do not for distinctly but instead for like a paddle, but in a normal child, the cells between the fingers and toes will die, forming distinct fingers and toes. Apert syndrome doesn’t allow this dying off of cells to happen, so the child’s hands and feet stay shaped like paddles.

, Often, when a child has Apert syndrome, there brain is not allowed to fully form because the bones of the skull put pressure on the brain and keep it from growing and forming. In most cases, the child will not have a fully functioning brain, making the child disabled.

Block out outside noises from the room.,
Get the child into their pajamas.,
Get the sleeping area ready.,
Help your child unwind in their room.,
Figure out which of Supernanny's two techniques might be best for your child.,
Keep calm and stay in the bedroom.,
Place the child into their crib.,
Turn out the lights in nearby rooms (such as hallways leading to the child's room).,
Sit down next to the crib, but keep within your child's eyesight.,
Resist the urge to get up and handle your child, unless they actually get out of their crib.,
Return the child back to their crib, if the child tries to escape.,
Return yourself to the same spot on the floor.,
Let the child cry until they tire themselves out and cry themselves off to sleep.,
Get up and walk out of the room once you can be assured that they have actively fallen asleep.

,
Handle subsequent nights.,
Bring the child into their bed, like you always would have done, then exit the room.,
Leave the room.,
Give them a hug and a cuddle as you pick them up and transport them back into their room the first time.,
Leave the room, much like you did before.

,
Wait for the second trip out of bed (if it happens).

,
Tell the child that it's nighttime, take them and bring them back into their room and place them back into their bed.,
Leave the room and wait for the child to come out, if they do.

,
Bring the child back into their bed without saying anything.,
Repeat this ""third trip"" out of bed routine until the child are convinced that they won't get a reaction from you.,
Stay consistent in the route and technique in subsequent nights that the child gets out of bed.

",How to Handle the Bedtime Routine Like Supernanny," Eliminate noises from telephones, computers, cell phones and other electronic devices during the period setting your kids up to go to sleep by telling people not to call after a certain time or silencing/unplugging your phone. Avoid using using electronic devices unless you are behind closed doors or far enough away that the child can't hear you.;
, Besides making them feel more comfortable at night, this can help signal to the child that bedtime is coming up. If you start by putting on their preferred pajamas, the child will learn to recognize that this part of the routine means it's time to relax and prepare for bed.


Plan ahead. If you have several children that need dressing assistance, you'll need to allot yourself enough time to get everyone ready for bed.
If the child still needs to wear a diaper, change it now, rather than having to disrupt the routine later.

, Make the room as mildly temperate as can be, whether that involves cooling it down or heating it up. If needed, you can add or subtract additional layers of clothes on the child, but adjust other factors in the room such as heaters and fans.

, Read books or sing them some calming songs; this will help to set the mood into ""nighttime mode"".

, Although both styles have their advantages, there's also an age factor that plays a part. The Sleep Separation Technique is meant for children who are younger than 3 years old, and the Stay in Bed Technique is usually aimed at older children.

Aim your methods towards getting the youngest children off first, before getting the others to sleep. Yes, at first the Stay In Bed technique can take a little bit of time to master, but with practice the child will learn and you can then move on to the older children with help from your significant other - or here you can split up the duties if you have someone else around at bedtime.

, Give the child the encouragement to fall asleep in their room. Give them kisses and hugs (cuddles, as Supernanny calls them).

, Most often times, this technique is used when the child sleeps in a crib and hasn't yet moved to their own bed.

, Try to remain quiet and move minimally, to avoid disrupting your child's rest.

, If you need to, you may end up sitting on the floor with your legs crossed Indian-style. Make sure that the child can see the side of your face, but refuse to give any direct eye contact to the child. It may be hard but this is essential to the method.


If you need to, use small strips of reflective tape to mark the place where you are sitting so you can return. (You may even need to do this prior to turning out the lights.)
Increase the distance between you and the child each night you use this technique. Make sure that you creep closer and closer to the door, as long as the child still feels secure in their crib.

, Make no communication with the child. This may be hard when they call for you, but remain consistent and firm in your approach.

, Avoid eye contact. Look away from the child, as you pick them up and place them back in their crib.

, Act as if you never left the spot; sit so that the child can still see the side of your face from the same spot.

, It'll be upsetting to hear them cry, but recognize that the child will be okay and isn't in pain; they just need to learn the new routine.

,, Each night following, move closer and closer to the door. Once you are outside the door, spend that night sitting there. After being outside the door, you can actively go about a normal routine., Talk to them and tell them that it's nighttime now when you place them into bed, and that you'd like them to calm down and relax.

, Whether you head back to your bedroom or stand just out of sight distance, they should not be able to see you. Wait for them to stir and get out of bed.

, Remind the child that it is nighttime in soft, mellow words as you walk them back into their room, before placing them back down into their bed. You might say, ""It's nighttime/bedtime darling,"" for example.


Try not to feed into their activity. By this time, if they can walk, have them walk into bed from wherever they are. If they can't quite walk (or refuse to), carry them back into bed either in the shoulder hold or cradle hold (letting their legs dangle free).

,,, Make this interaction very brief, including a brief kiss and cuddle if needed. Use the Supernanny-approved ""Bedtime, darling"" response.

,, This is an easy step to forget, but it's important after a third attempt not to say anything.

, They will begin to realize that bedtime means ""sleep"". Don't kiss or cuddle them on these subsequent trips back to bed. Follow through with whether or not you'll be able to carry them.

Keep your child’s eyes lubricated.,
Use baby shampoo to keep your child’s eyelashes free of bacteria.,
Give your child protective eyewear.",How to Treat a Child with Apert Syndrome2," If your child’s eyes bulge outward because of this syndrome, it is important to keep them lubricated. The best way to do this is by using eye drops (which are also called artificial tears). The eye drops will help to keep your child’s eyes from getting scratched. This is important because scratches along the lining of your child’s eyes could potentially lead to vision problems.To use the eyes drops:


Apply the eye drops to your child’s eyes at least four times a day for maximum effect.
Check to see if the solution is temperature sensitive. If it is, keep it in the fridge.

, Mild, non-comedogenic (meaning it doesn’t block pores) cleansers and mild baby shampoos can be used to prevent bacteria from accumulating near your child’s eyes, leading to irritation and infection. It is best to do this at night to wash away any dirt that accumulated during the day.To clean your child’s eyelashes:



Step 1: Make sure your child’s eyes are kept closed, and get them damp. Right after showering is a great time to do this. Make sure that your child’s eyes stay closed. Wash your hands with warm water and soap.

Step 2: Put a pea-sized drop of shampoo on your clean index finger. Gently rub the shampoo along your child’s eyelashes. Give the eyelashes 40 gentle rubs.

Step 3: Rinse off excess shampoo with a washcloth and warm water.

, Because your child’s eyes are more exposed to dirt and bacteria than most other children, it’s important to give him as much protection as possible. Sunglasses are the best protection for outside activities, while normal glasses or even eye goggles can be worn when doing activities inside that could potentially get into your child’s eyes.

Clean your child’s ears often.,
Try ginkgo biloba.,
Talk to a doctor about getting hearing aids for your child.",How to Treat a Child with Apert Syndrome3," Because your child’s ears might be malformed, there is potential for excess ear secretions and dirt to build up in her ears. You should clean your child’s ears every day.


You can also use an antimicrobial therapy medication to keep your child’s ears clean. This would have to be prescribed by a doctor. The usual medication prescribed in amoxicillin.

, Some people believe that ginkgo biloba, an herb, as an effect on hearing loss and can actually help to restore short term hearing loss. While there are no studies to back this up, you can still give it a try.Give your child two 160mg tablets daily over a course of 6 weeks.

, If your child is suffering from hearing loss, you should consider getting him hearing aids that will help him to maintain the level of hearing that he does have.


If your child’s hearing loss is too great for hearing aids to be of use, you can consider enrolling your child in sign language classes.

Use a nasal suction to help your child breath.,
Use a humidifier to help drain your child’s nose.,
Try to keep your child from sleeping on his back.,
Use a bottle to feed your child if she has a cleft palate.,
Monitor your infant’s feeding time.",How to Treat a Child with Apert Syndrome4," It your child’s nose is deformed and has not been repaired, you can consider using a nasal suction to unblock the airways in your child’s nose. This suction device sucks out the secretions in your child’s nose so that she can breath more easily.To use the device:


Make sure that the device is clean. You can wash it with warm water and soap. If the suction device is dirty, it could introduce bacteria into the nose.
Insert the device into your child’s nose. Don’t be afraid to allow it to go deeper because this will help all remove the deeper secretions.
Cover the other nostril and then use the suction device. This will make the suction as strong as possible. Release the suction slowly to so that none of hair in the nostril gets pulled.

, You can install a humidifier in your child’s room--the humid air will help to loosen up the secretions in your child’s nose, ensuring that they come out rather than blocking up his nasal passageways.


You can also use a store-bought nasal decongestant such as phenylephrine. Put two to three drops in both of your child’s nostrils every four hours.

, Letting your child sleep on his left or right side, or on his stomach, rather than on his back. Doing this will ensure that the secretions in his nose will drain out of his nose, rather than dripping down his throat.


You can also prop your child up so that he sleeps in a semi-upright position to help his lungs expand as much as possible when he breathes while sleeping.

, Having a cleft palate makes it almost impossible for an infant to breastfeed. Instead, fill a bottle that has a top that enhances your infant’s feeding capability. You can still use your breast milk, though you can also use a milk formula if it is recommended by your pediatrician.Try to angle the bottle so that the milk goes into your child’s mouth away from the cleft palate. Always keep your baby sitting upright when you feed her so that she doesn’t choke.

, If you are using a bottle to feed your infant, you will need to keep track of how long you feed her for. Infants normally fill up after 30 minutes so try not to exceed 30 minutes when you feed your infant.


Wait at least two hours before feeding your infant again. If you feed your baby more frequently, she may develop a difficulty with gaining weight.

Consider facial reconstruction surgery.,
Know that surgery can be done to repair your child’s shallow eye sockets.,
Talk to a surgeon about cleft palate reconstruction.,
Have your child’s fingers and toes separated surgically.,
Consider LeFort III surgery.",How to Treat a Child with Apert Syndrome5," One of the most common surgical treatments for this condition is reconstruction surgery. During the surgery, the prematurely fused bones will be separated and your child’s head will be reshaped so that the brain can develop normally. This is done by installing body-friendly plates into your child’s skull that will be spontaneously absorbed into the bones over time.


This surgery is typically done between the ages of 6 to 12 months. So far, there hasn’t been any conclusive studies showing that it makes a difference if the surgery is done before 6 months of age.

, Sometimes, the eye sockets of a child with Apert syndrome can be so malformed that the child’s eyes bulge out and become susceptible to infections that could ultimately lead to blindness. If this is the case with your child, you may want to consider surgery to repair the shallowness of your child’s eye sockets., The roof of the mouth serves as a barrier between the nose and mouth. Cleft palate cases pose problems because there is an incomplete barrier. Infections from the nose may reach the mouth and vice versa. Choking becomes more frequent as well. Therefore, the barrier must be restored through surgery.

, Before even considering this, it is important to know that this surgery is almost exclusively done for aesthetic purposes only--the ability to use the fingers and toes is usually not able to be restored. Surgeons can, however, separate your child’s fingers and toes for aesthetic improvement.

, This surgical procedure reconstructs your child’s face so that the nose, eyes, and mouth function better. It can also correct the deformities that are caused by the syndrome, making your child’s face look more like children who do not have this syndrome.


This surgery is normally performed when your child is 6 to 8 years old.
The surgery can also be done that only focuses on your child’s nose--it makes the bridge of the nose more prominent.

Enroll him in special ed classes if he is mentally disabled.,
Go to parental counseling.,
Allow your child to get as much physical exercise as she wants.,
Give your child a healthy, well-balanced diet.",How to Treat a Child with Apert Syndrome6," If your child has problems grasping simple concepts, you may want to talk to a specialist who can help you to help your child. The specialist you can speak to include:


Special educator: They can help you come up with game plan to give your child as much education as she can receive.
Occupational therapist: They teach the motor skills necessary for your child to function on his own. For example, an occupational therapist can teach your son how to feed himself.

, Even though you love your child more than anyone else in the world, raising a child with physical and mental disabilities can be a challenge. Going to parental counseling can give you the support you need. Counselors can give you tips on making your child’s life as easy as possible, while also giving you time to talk about your own experiences.


You can also consider joining a local support group. It can be really nice to talk to people who are in a similar situation as you are.

, Apert syndrome does not generally limit the physical exercise that your child can get. In fact, physical exercise is really important. Allow your child to get at least 30 minutes of physical exercise a day. This can mean:


Jogging, biking, swimming, walking the dog, or even doing household chores.

Wash your baby's body.,
Keep your baby warm in a towel or blanket during washing.,
Make a list of the proper toiletries to prepare for packing.,
Take note of the different amenities at your travel destination to plan your bath.,
Gather the items after the bath to stay organized.",How to Give Your Baby a Bath when Traveling," Giving a baby a bath in a hotel room can pose all sorts of problems, so it is always best to call ahead to know what you will be dealing with.


For example, the bathroom may not have enough floor space for you to comfortably kneel beside the tub to bathe the baby.
In addition, although most bathrooms contain a bathtub, some hotel rooms have only a shower stall.
When making reservations at a hotel, you should ask about the bathroom to be sure that it is appropriate for giving your baby a bath.
If it doesn’t sound like the originally planned hotel room will work, you can ask for a different room or make reservations at a different hotel.;
, While the tub is filling, you should set up the bath essentials before your baby is put in the tub.


You should put yourself where you will be while bathing the baby and make sure that everything is easy to reach.
If the tub is set up differently from the one at home, you should have a plan for getting the baby in and out of the tub smoothly.
After everything is ready, you can undress the baby and proceed with the bath just as you would at home.

, It might seem like a strange thing to do at a hotel or relative’s home, but it may ease your mind if you at least put some water in the tub and wipe it down with a separate washcloth before giving your baby a bath.


This is because you have no real knowledge about when the tub was cleaned last, how thoroughly it was cleaned, and what type of chemicals were used to clean it.
Wetting the tub and wiping it down with a washcloth removes any surface dirt and chemical residue that might be present.

, Along with the actual physical arrangement of bathrooms, at both a relative’s home and a hotel, there may also be a difference in how quickly the water becomes hot and the temperature that it reaches.


This is something you won't know until you are actually getting the bath ready, but it needs to be done for every bath that the baby is given while away from home.
The bathwater may vary in temperature from one bath to another, due to high demand from other users in the building, an old or faulty water heater, or any number of other reasons.
Although it isn’t very common, there is also the possibility that the water might not be as clean and clear as it is at home.
For example, some older homes, and possibly hotels, may have pipework that is rusty and the rust may cause the water to be cloudy or tinged.
This is usually cleared up by letting the water run for a few minutes before plugging the drain in the tub.

, You can actually go into the shower stall with your baby to wash them there.


When the shower is used, it is important to check the water temperature and the force of the spray.

, If the water spray is very strong, the faucet can be turned down so that less water exits the shower head.


Babies do not react well to high-powered water, so it is always best to make sure that the shower puts out more of a light drizzle than a strong blast.

, Since most babies do not like the feeling of the water hitting their skin, especially their face, you can use their own body to block the shower spray.


Use your hand to guide the water onto the baby.
Cup your hands and rinse your baby off by gentle dumping cupped water onto them.

, Keep in mind that the baby will be slippery while wet, so it is important to be sure that you have a good hold on your baby.


One of the easiest poses for washing a baby in the shower is for you to have the baby’s back against your abdomen with your arm wrapped around the baby’s abdomen.
In this position, nearly all of the baby’s body can be reached easily and you can gently press the baby against your abdomen if they start to slip.

, To give your baby a sponge bath, use the sink for the bathwater, but instead of putting your infant in the sink, hold them on the counter and give them a sponge bath.


This allows you to give an infant a bath without the fear of using a large tub.
If you are not comfortable holding your infant up high in the shower, this can be a great option.

, When you're ready to begin the sponge bath, undress your baby and wrap him or her in a towel.


Make sure to put your baby on a soft blanket, towel or pad that you've prepared.

, Wet your washcloth, wring out the excess water and begin washing your baby.


Wash your baby's face first, making sure to be gentle.
Use a damp cotton ball or cloth to wipe each eyelid, from the inside to the outside corner.

, Wash your baby's body with a washcloth or sponge to make sure they are cleaned thoroughly.


When you clean your baby's body, plain water is OK.
If your baby is especially dirty, use a mild moisturizing soap.
Make sure to take note of creases under the arms, behind the ears, around the neck and in the diaper area.
Wash between your baby's fingers and toes.

, Since your baby is not sitting in warm water during a sponge bath, it is important to wrap a towel around the baby to keep them from getting chilled.


You should keep one hand on the baby and just expose the baby’s body parts as they are being washed.

, It is very annoying to get part way through your baby’s bath and suddenly realize that you forgot something, especially if you are alone with your baby and the item is not within your reach.


In order to prevent this from happening while you are away from home, you should make a list of everything you use while you are giving your baby a bath at home before you leave.
Of course, to make traveling easier, only the essentials should be packed.
The list should include your baby’s soap, shampoo, washcloth, towel, and hairbrush or comb.
Another thing you should pack is a bath mat, to prevent your baby from sliding on the bottom of the tub.
Although not necessary, some parents also choose to pack a few bath toys for older babies.
Try keeping the list in a small tote or other easily carried bag where all of the bath essentials can be packed and kept together on the trip.
This makes it very convenient to just grab the tote when it is time for the baby’s bath.
The tote can even be packed into another piece of luggage to keep it from getting lost while traveling.

, Whether you are staying with relatives or renting lodging in a hotel, the bathroom amenities are more than likely going to be different than those that you are used to at home.


If you prefer to give your young infant a bath in a sink, there may be a problem with the faucet being at a poor angle.
If this is the case, it may be necessary to resort to the tub.
If you are worried about your infant being in the tub, you can get in the tub water with the baby to support them during the bath.

, After the baby is bathed, dressed, and in a safe place, you need to drain the tub and gather up the baby’s bath essentials.


Wet items, like the washcloth and towel, need to be hung up somewhere to dry.
The bath mat can be laid out flat on a towel to dry overnight.
If it is just a one night stay, these things should be put somewhere obvious so that they are not left behind.
The rest of the bath essentials can be packed back into the tote so they are ready for departure.
If toys were used in the tub, a mesh cloth bag can be used to help them dry quickly without taking up much space.
The bag of toys can be hung from the faucet, a hook, or a towel rod so that the toys can drip dry.

Start giving lessons between ages five and seven.,
Practice at a natural time of day.,
Ask the child to assist you.,
Keep the tying method consistent.",How to Teach a Blind or Visually Impaired Child to Tie Their Shoes1," Teachers of the blind and visually impaired often stress the importance of learning age-appropriate skills, which contributes to developing motor functioning and increasing independence.Most children learn to tie their shoes between the ages of five and seven, so a blind child should also start learning during this age range.Start off slow with the child, since learning this skill won't happen overnight. You don't have to start until you feel they're ready.
Until they learn to tie their own laces, keep the child in Velcro-fastened shoes.;
, The most ideal time is when the child would typically be taking their shoes on/off. For instance, you could work a practice session into your child’s daily dressing routine each morning. If you’re running late, don’t rush through your usual practice session. Instead, make it a point to practice with the child later that day, when there’s plenty of time for them to sit down and attempt it multiple times.

Forcing a practice session when you have to rush may cause the child to feel frustrated.
Summer vacation and spring break are other good times to focus on learning this skill, since the child's schedule is a little looser.

, Until they’ve mastered the skill themselves, encourage your child to assist in whatever way as you're helping them get into their shoes. For instance, you could ask the child to help you loop a shoestring around your finger or place their hands on top of yours to feel the motions. Describe your actions clearly as they assist you., There is no single way to tie shoe laces; there are a variety of approaches. Decide which one you think will be easiest for your child and make sure that you teach only that technique consistently. If other members of your family are also helping to teach the child, make sure they know which technique you’re using and stick to that one."
"
Teach them in stages.,
Have the child place their hands on top of yours.,
Discuss the motions as you go through them.,
Explain each step verbally.,
Support them from behind.",How to Teach a Blind or Visually Impaired Child to Tie Their Shoes2," It takes time for children with normal sight to learn to tie their shoelaces; it will take a little more time for blind and visually impaired children to learn the same skill. Break the process up into stages and teach the child small chunks at a time. Once they’ve mastered one stage, move on to teaching them the next one., Introduce shoelace tying by having your child put their hands on top of yours while you tie your own shoes. This allows the child to “watch” you go through the actions and helps them get a feeling for what motions they will be using. Keep in mind that most sighted people also learn to tie their shoes through touch as well as sight, so touch is an important factor.Make sure to have the child sit next to you, rather than in front of you, so they can get used to how the actions feel from the correct perspective.

, This will help them learn about spatial concepts. Discuss movements in terms of up and down, front and back, right and left and in front of or behind. Demonstrate what a loop is and carefully explain how loops work. As you explain the movement, make sure you’re also demonstrating it so the child can feel what those words mean., The exact phrasing will depend on what tying technique you’re teaching, but use phrases like, “Take the right lace and cross it over the left lace.” Demonstrate while they “watch” with their hands. “Grab the right lace in your left hand and the left lace in your right hand. Pull them tightly.” “Make a loop with your thumb and index finger.” Provide short, easy-to-demonstrate explanations for each motion., Once the child is ready to move on from just “watching” you tie laces, make sure you continue to support them from behind. Let them take the lead, with you gently correcting movements and guiding when necessary. Have the child explain to you what they’re doing with each movement as they go through the motions."
"
Use a shoelace “book.” This is essentially a large format book with thick pages that have laces weaved into them, just as they would be in regular shoes.,
Use shoelaces with different sizes and textures.,
Start “big.” If your child is having trouble with the dexterity required for smaller laces, start with a very large format.,
Be patient and encouraging.",How to Teach a Blind or Visually Impaired Child to Tie Their Shoes3," Often, these laces are larger than normal and easier for a child to handle. Being able to hold the book in their lap while they learn can be helpful as they acquire basic motor skills.Once they do, you can move on to teaching on an actual shoe they are wearing on their foot.
You can also make your own “shoes” out of cardboard to teach your child with. Poke holes and thread the laces of your choice through them., Laces with different sizes and textures can help a visually impaired child keep track of which one is the left lace and which one is the right lace. Making them distinctive will help them feel more confident as they learn the motions. Use any combination that you wish, as long as they are easily distinguishable by touch.

For example, you could use a combination of round laces, wide flat laces, velvet cords, beading, bootlaces, string – get creative!
Stiff laces that don’t flop over easily tend to work best for this.

, For instance, put a big fuzzy robe on the child and show them how to tie the belt around their waist.You could also begin by showing them how to tie the lace around their leg first, right above the knee.

Once they get the hang of that, move on to smaller formats and putting them in the sitting position required for tying an actual shoe.

, If your child simply cannot learn to tie their shoes at this time, that’s ok! It takes time. Don’t let your child become discouraged and make sure you keep practicing occasionally so they don’t lose what muscle memory they’ve already learned up to this point.

In the meantime, look for elastic shoelaces that can be ""pre-tied"" so the shoes can be easily slipped on. Velcro-fastened shoes will also work, but the elastic shoelaces look almost like regular ones, which may help your child feel less different at school."

Accept your child's limits.,
Try reducing stress.,
Set up a routine.,
Communicate honestly and openly with your child.,
Offer plenty of emotional support.,
Support your child.,
Talk to your child's school personnel.",How to Support a Child with Bipolar Disorder1," A person with bipolar disorder cannot control their mood. Your child may have waves of mood swings. If they're experiencing a manic episode or depressive episode, they can't control themselves and snap out of it. The ups and downs can last for weeks at a time. A child can find it difficult to cope with this. Because of the BD, your child may display different limits compared to other children. The best way to deal with this is to accept it.Avoid trying to reason with your child. Don't tell them things like, ""Stop acting crazy,"" or, ""Look on the bright side"".
Validate your child's feelings and accept how they feel. Tell them, ""Your feelings are valid. There is nothing wrong with feeling what you feel."";
, Everyone experiences stress from time to time. However, increased stress can make bipolar disorder worse for your child. This stress may occur at home or school. Even though you can't get rid of all the stress for your child, try to take steps to prevent added stress, such as working with them to properly manage their time.Ask your child how you can help if they feel stressed out about something, and try to help them the best you can. Say, ""I know stress upsets you. What can I do to help you manage your stress?"" If your child is not old enough to understand this, you can keep a behavior journal to try to track various triggers or circumstances that lead to them getting stressed.
When you learn your child's limits, pay attention to them. Avoid pushing your child to their limits unnecessarily.
For example, if your child gets overwhelmed by a certain chore, give them a different chore; however, don't just eliminate all the chores. You still want to make sure to teach your child responsibility, but your child just may not be able to do as much or certain things.
If your child feels stressed by school, you can try talking to the teacher. For example, if too much homework stresses your child, try to talk to their teacher to see if they can lessen the amount.

, Consider creating a routine for your child to reduce stress in their life. Routine will help your child get used to responsibilities and know what to expect so that they don't get overwhelmed. Chaos and instability may make their bipolar disorder worse. An established routine can help your child avoid stress and cope with daily life. Doing the same thing at the same time every day gives them a sense of security in knowing what comes next.The routine should include when your child wakes up, mealtimes, study/homework time, chores, playtime, and when they go to bed.
Most children with bipolar disorder function best in a structured routine. Many also have short attention spans. Be patient and ready to move on to another activity when they are.

, Always try your best to validate your child's feelings and truly listen to how they're feeling. When your child tries to talk to you about something, give them all your attention. Really listen to what they have to say, even if you don't understand how they feel. Communication is key to help your child with bipolar disorder.If your child approaches you, turn off all electronic devices and focus on them. Tell them, ""I am listening to you."" You may want to repeat some of the things they say, ask questions, or respond to let them know you are listening to them.
If your child doesn't talk to you, try to open the lines of communication. Tell them, ""I know that your bipolar disorder may be confusing or overwhelming at times. You may not know how to talk about it. I am here to listen without judgment to whatever you are feeling."" You may want to try a prompt, such as, ""Give me two feeling words for how you're doing right now.""
When you notice your child is not in the best mood, be honest about it and ask how they're feeling in a loving manner. You may say, ""How are you feeling today? You seem a little upset."" Or, ""It's okay that your mood has shifted. I'm here for you and will listen to you.""

, When your child is having a rough time, your words play a big role on how they'll react. Avoid covering up their feelings and acting like their feelings are easy to cope with. This will end up making them feel worse, as if they're emotions really don't matter.Be aware of saying statements, such as ""It's not so bad;"" ""Be positive;"" ""You're over-reacting. It's not that bad;"" or ""It's okay. Be tough.""
Instead, validate their feelings and show that you do care. Say things like, ""You're not alone. I'm right here for you,"" or, ""I may not be able to understand how you exactly feel, but I'm always here to listen and help you."" You can also say, ""You are very important to me and your life matters a lot to me,"" and, ""I know it doesn't feel like it now, but the way you feel will change.""

, Your child may feel embarrassed, ashamed, or guilty for having bipolar disorder, especially if they're the only one in the family who has this disorder. Support your child and tell them that it's okay and that having bipolar disorder is not their fault. If your child continually says that they're a hassle to deal with, firmly tell them that's not true and that you're always there for them, even if you don't know exactly how they feel.You can talk to them about various famous people who struggled with bipolar disorder in order to normalize their situation. Examples include Carrie Fisher, Demi Lovato, Vincent van Gogh, and Virginia Woolf.
Tell your child, ""You are not to blame for your disorder. You didn't cause it, and there are things we can do to help you feel better."" You can also say, ""It's not your fault that you have bipolar disorder; that's how you are and there are treatments that can help you."" Or try, ""You shouldn't feel guilty about your disorder. There are ways to feel better.""

, Your child may need special allowances when they go to school so that their needs are met. Your child may need to take breaks during classes, be assigned less homework during difficult times, delay important instruction until they feel alert, and reduce some assignments, projects, or tests.

Consider family therapy.,
Ask for help.",How to Support a Child with Bipolar Disorder4," Your child plays a big role in your life and takes up a lot of your time. While helping your child is important, don't forget about yourself. Continue to participate in activities and hobbies you love and enjoy.Don't give up gatherings, traveling plans, friendships, goals, and interests because of your child.

, Helping and raising a child with bipolar disorder can be a challenge, and it can also be mentally draining. Talk to a trusted friend or family member about how you feel. Ask for help when you need it from friends and family members.


Consider meeting parents with children who have bipolar disorder as well to get the emotional support and courage you need. You may want to seek out a support group for the loved ones of those with bipolar disorder in your area.
Talk to a counselor or therapist if you need. They can help you learn to deal with your emotions while taking care of your child and yourself.

, Understand that setting a few boundaries for yourself is okay. Remember, you need to take care of yourself, too. Taking care of yourself allows you to better care for your child. Decide where your personal limits are and what activities or actions will need boundaries.For example, think about how much time you're with your child everyday. Create boundaries for how long you should spend time with your child without feeling overwhelmed and distressed. Allow another trusted adult to watch over your child when you need a break.
You will likely need boundaries with other people, as well, to reduce your overall level of stress.

, Having a child with bipolar disorder can be very difficult. Managing stress helps keep you healthy emotionally and physically. Reduce all unnecessary stress from your life.Consider cutting a few appointments or activities if they're not needed and make you feel tired and exhausted.
Remember to exercise daily, eat healthy meals, and get enough sleep at night, as these things can all influence your stress levels.
Consider incorporating stress relieving activities, like deep breathing exercises, yoga, or meditation.

, Having a bipolar family member can be challenging for those who live in the same household as your child. Family therapy can help with any family issues and provide you with assistance. It can also help teach your family members how to have a more successful and healthy relationship with your child.If your child has siblings, they may be scared to approach their sibling or may feel jealous since you give a lot of your attention on the child with bipolar disorder.
If you are married or in a relationship, helping your child may leave you worn out and frustrated towards your spouse.

, You don't need to let your child consume all of your time. Consider taking breaks and having time for yourself or others. Allow another trusted adult watch your child while you do something for yourself. Your child is important, but you don't want to forget about yourself, too.Asking for help doesn't make you weak. You shouldn't have to do this alone. Work with your spouse or partner if you have one, or ask others to help you so that you do not have to do it all by yourself.

Offer help with daily tasks.,
Make yourself available.,
Volunteer to babysit.,
Help the parents gather information.,
Offer to take notes at meetings.",How to Support Parents of Children with Disabilities1," All parents need help sometimes, regardless of whether disability is a factor in their families. Parents of special needs children may not necessarily ask you for help – they may be ashamed or embarrassed, or they may just want to avoid putting you out. As someone who cares for them and wants to show your support, notice ways you can help and simply do those things.For example, if you're over at the parents' home and notice some dirty dishes in the sink, just start doing them. If the parents try to get you to stop, insist that it's your pleasure to help.
You also might help with laundry or other household chores.
If the parents have other children, you might give them a ride home from sports practices or after-school activities so the parents can get their child to a therapy or doctor's appointment. This can be particularly easy to do if you have children of similar ages who are involved in the same activities.
Be prepared for some push back from the parents. They may be embarrassed, or think you view them as a charity case or as people who are unable to do what they need to do for their family. Tell them that isn't the case, that all families could use support sometimes, and that you're happy to do what you can to help them out. Respect their boundaries if they want to do particular tasks themselves, but push back when their ""no"" comes out of a desire to be polite, rather than a genuine wish to tackle something independently.;
, Everyone needs companionship and personal support, and parents of children with disabilities are no different. Due to their child's special needs, they may have limited availability or can only spend time with you during odd hours.Offer to take the parents out for coffee or other activities you know they enjoy. You also should be willing to come over to their house rather than going out in public, recognizing that they may be reluctant to leave their children at home.
For example, if you know the mother loves vanilla lattes from a local café, you might pick one up for her and bring it to her at home.
If you can't get away to go see them, have a phone date to catch up. You can even use FaceTime or Skype to spend some quality time together. Also, understand that your friend may want to talk about their child, or not at all. Respect the conversation as they lay it out.
Keep in mind that if you want to maintain a friendship and provide companionship to parents with disabled children, you must be willing to meet them on their terms most of the time. Expect the relationship to be somewhat one-sided, and to make a greater effort to come to them than they make to come to you.

, As long as the parents trust you to care for their child, babysitting can give the parents a chance to do things on their own or to simply relax and have some time to themselves.Parents often have difficulty finding babysitters they trust to care for their child. They will be more likely to allow you to babysit if they know you understand their child's needs and how to keep the child safe and happy.
Perhaps more important, special needs children may react with fear or discomfort to strangers. If the child knows and trusts you, they may feel more comfortable staying with you while their parents aren't around.
Parents also may feel guilty about leaving their child or doing things on their own. They may worry about what might happen while they're gone. Reassure them that everything will be fine, and that spending time on their own will renew their spirit and motivation.

, Some parents are driven to conduct extensive research about their child's disability or diagnosis and the resources available locally. Others may not have the time or the motivation – especially if they have other kids at home.Ask the parents about specific areas where you might research, or if there are any topics on which they could use more information.
You also may want to help them find information about support groups or local organizations that can provide assistance to their child.
Don't push them to take particular actions or join a particular group, as they may fear that you'll judge them or look down on them if they don't follow your suggestion. Rather, look for more information on services that they express interest in.
For example, the mom might mention that she'd be interested in joining a support group for parents of children with disabilities. You could say ""That sounds like a good idea. I'd be happy to research the groups in our area so you can pick the best one more easily.""

, The lives of the parents of a special needs child are often filled with appointments to doctors, therapists, and other healthcare professionals. Going with them to these meetings allows them to focus on listening.At these meetings, parents are frequently inundated with information, and they may have difficulty processing it all at once. If they're trying to listen, apply the information to their child, and take notes at the same time, they may miss out on something important.
You also can write down key words, bits of lingo, or other information they may want to research more in-depth after the meeting.
Taking notes also frees the parents from worrying about remembering everything said to them, so they can focus on what is said and ask the questions they need to ask to fully understand what the doctor or therapist is saying about their child.

"
"
Empathize with the parents.,
Acknowledge the parents' concerns.,
Stay positive.,
Avoid giving unsolicited advice.",How to Support Parents of Children with Disabilities2," Empathy is one of the most powerful tools you can use to support parents of special needs children. The parents often have feelings of grief and loss of dreams and expectations, and they may feel guilty about these feelings.Stay away from saying ""I'm sorry"" or making similar comments, but be sure to validate their feelings. It may be essentially automatic for you to apologize, but this isn't what the parents need to hear. You have nothing to apologize for, and you'll better support the parents by accentuating the positive rather than acting like something terrible has happened to them.
Ask if there is anything specific that offends or annoys them, so you can refrain from doing those things. For example, some people are deeply offended by ""people-first"" language, in which you describe their child as a ""child with special needs"" rather than a ""special needs child."" They prefer ""identity-first"" language, instead.Although the word is used in legal and social contexts, many people also dislike the word ""disability,"" because it focuses on what the child can't do rather than what they can. Others prefer it to terms they find patronizing or condescending. The only real way to know is to ask about their personal preference, if they have one.

, Parents with special needs children want to protect their child, and may have significant concerns about the future. As someone who cares for them, your role is to acknowledge those concerns and recognize them as valid.Avoid using dismissive language. If the parents mention something about their child, you may be inclined to say something like ""oh, that's no big deal."" However, for that child it may be a very big deal.
Similarly, saying the child will grow out of it or be ""better"" when they're older will only show that you don't understand that child's diagnosis or how it affects their life.
Instead, accept the parents' concerns at face value and acknowledge their validity. You might say ""I understand that you're concerned about Jamie making friends in a new school. That's a valid concern. What can I do to help?"" You can also say, “What are you thinking about doing about it?” to help them develop solutions.

, Parents with disabled children often feel powerless to help their children and may believe they are not providing enough for their children or doing all that they can do. You can support the parents by reminding them of the good things and maintaining a positive outlook on the future.They need people to remind them that they are good parents, so when you see them doing something admirable, say so.


Be there to celebrate with them on the good days, and on the bad days you can be the one to remind them of the good days and reassure them that there are many more good days ahead.
At times you may not feel like being positive, but being optimistic (even if you have to fake it) encourages the parents and families to carry on.
You do want to keep your optimism in check, though. Don't insist on a positive attitude at the expense of failing to acknowledge the parents' legitimate concerns. Saying things like ""Oh, it'll be just fine. There's nothing to worry about!"" can make the parents think you're being dismissive.

, If you also have experience with disability, the parents may come to you with questions. However, if you don't have experience raising a special needs child you typically aren't going to have any advice that would be helpful.If you've been reading about the child's diagnosis or about parenting disabled children, you may find an article or website that you want to share with the parents. However, you shouldn't do this in a way that comes across like you are judging them, or criticizing their parenting skills.
For example, if you read something that you think would benefit the parents, you might say ""I read this article yesterday that reminded me of you as a parent. Would you like me to send you the link?"" If they are interested, you can share it with them.

Educate yourself on disabilities and disability rights.,
Talk to the parents about their child.,
Speak out against discrimination.,
Assist with fundraisers or awareness events.",How to Support Parents of Children with Disabilities3," Children with disabilities and their parents need allies who are willing to stand up for disability rights and help advocate for the disabled community in employment, school, and community contexts.Read up on disability rights in your country, as well as the resources available locally. This will help you to recognize when there's a legal solution to a problem the parents are having.
Understanding disability rights also gives you a way to support parents of special needs children by making others aware. For example, if your workplace isn't accessible, you might talk to your manager about making the necessary adjustments so it is accessible to all people. This helps not only the parents you know, but other parents and other people with disabilities.
Parents of special needs children especially need help in the education context. The parents may feel that the child's school is not adequately addressing their child's needs, or that the child needs additional assistance. You may be able to point them to programs that would better serve their child.

, You can show support to simply by acknowledging the child and expressing an interest. Parents often welcome legitimate questions in an effort to better understand their child and their child's diagnosis.You can ask questions without judging, and parents will appreciate you acknowledging and taking an interest in their child. Too often, disabled children aren't mentioned – sometimes because people don't know what to say, or are afraid to ask questions and potentially offend the parents.
Also, take an interest in their child outside of the child's disability. Know their birthday, learn their favorite things, celebrate their milestones, etc.
Parents with special needs children typically are happy to talk about their child and explain different aspects of the child's personality or behavior. Having these conversations not only shows support for the parents, but helps you better understand the child.

, Children with disabilities often face tremendous prejudice and stigma because they are different from ""normal"" kids. Combating discrimination when you see it is a way to advocate for the child and show your support for their parents.As you read more about disability rights, you'll start to realize that for many people, words and phrases such as ""retard"" or ""riding the short bus"" are deeply insulting and offensive. When you hear others using these words or phrases, call them out on it.
If you see someone with special needs being bullied or insulted, you have an opportunity to stand up for their rights and help them.
Stopping discrimination when you see it helps to make the world a more welcoming place for all children.

, Connect with a state or national disability rights organization, or with a nonprofit. Not only can you donate, but you can work as a volunteer to help spread the word about disability rights.You don't need to be disabled yourself, or be the parent of a special needs child, to join these organizations and work with them.
Awareness and advocacy organizations also can be a good way for you to participate in activities along with the parents and their children.
Make sure you research non-governmental organizations before joining or donating. You want to understand their goals and make sure you agree with those goals. Ideally, people with disabilities should hold prominent positions, or at least have a strong voice, within the organization. Stay away from organizations that claim to help people with a particular diagnosis or disability, but don't engage those people in their activities or their decision-making process.

Figure out why the disabled child acts maladaptively.,
Sometimes, the best solution is not to train the child, but to remove the stressor.,
Ask yourself why you want to change the behavior.,
Consult the disabled community to find out what purpose the behavior serves, and if it is harmful or not to get rid of it.",How to Reduce Maladaptive Behavior in Children with Disabilities1," Determine what happens before each incident, and how that makes the child feel. You cannot help a child with maladaptive behavior until you understand how it works.


If possible, ask the child directly why they do that. During or after the episode, ask the child what went wrong and why they acted the way they did. Usually they have specific needs that are not being met.
Checklists exist for helping determine the reason behind maladaptive behaviors.;
, For example, if a girl only hits her head when seeing her therapist and being told ""quiet hands,"" then she is trying to communicate that she is being mistreated.Find her a respectful therapist and the maladaptive behavior will cease.

, Is it causing direct harm (such as self-injury or screaming loudly around other people) or is it merely strange (e.g. flapping arms)? Take a day or two to ponder this question.


If the behavior doesn't cause real harm, then getting rid of it will probably cause more harm than good.Forcing people to appear ""normal"" is a waste of time that will ultimately diminish their self-esteem and tire them out.

,


Sometimes, well-intentioned people will extinguish a behavior, only to find out that their actions are robbing the disabled person of an important coping mechanism.This can be abusive and traumatic to the disabled person.For example, if you want to understand an autistic boy, then ask autistic people, because they experience the feelings and urges themselves.

"
"
Take the disabled child aside and explain your position.,
Work together with the child to brainstorm potential solutions.,
When you see the child engaging in the maladaptive behavior, ask them to use the replacement behavior instead.,
Encourage the child when they begin to use the replacement behavior.,
Younger children may benefit from a reward system.,
Keep clear communication between yourself and the child.",How to Reduce Maladaptive Behavior in Children with Disabilities2," Tell them that you see them doing a maladaptive behavior, that it upsets you to see them so upset, and that you'd like to help them find a way to cope better.


Chances are, the child does not enjoy maladaptive behavior. For example, a boy who scratches his arms probably doesn't like the pain and injury that follows; he does it because he doesn't know how else to cope. He may be very pleased to learn that he can scratch his sweatpants or thin sleeves to get the same sensation on his body without leaving marks.

, Pull out a piece of paper and create a list of alternative behaviors. Encourage your child to come up with ideas. This will help them feel ownership over their treatment, and it makes them more likely to remember and implement the strategies. Consider...


Ways to minimize triggers (e.g. bringing earplugs or headphones, taking breaks from stressful situations)
Alternative actions (e.g. shaking the head instead of hitting it, fidgeting with a stim toy instead of ripping all the paper in the house)
Creating an action plan (e.g. coming up with a hand signal that means ""get me out of here"" when the child notices stress building up, so she can calm down somewhere quiet instead of pushing herself to the point of explosion)

, For example, if your son screams when upset, calmly ask him to take deep breaths and tell you what's wrong, just like you brainstormed together.


Be gentle with the child. Maladaptive behavior often emerges during stress, so (s)he may not be thinking clearly, and may need extra reminders.
Remind the child why the replacement behavior is good. For example, ""It's hard for me to help you when you scream. If you talk to me and tell me what's wrong, then I'll understand why you're upset, and I can help you fix the problem.""

, Praise their efforts and tell them how proud you are of their skills.


For example, ""I noticed that you were getting mad, and that you started to take deep breaths and walked away. I'm really proud of how strong and mature you were. Good job!""
Emphasize why they did a good thing. This helps them learn the distinction between people-pleasing and constructively taking advice. Never pressure the child or teach them to comply for compliance's sake, as this will hamper their social skills as an adult.

, For example, each time a girl successfully uses breathing techniques to calm herself, she gets a gold sticker to place on her chart. When she fills the chart, you bring home a treat from the grocery store or let her pick out a small toy.

Avoid overusing reward systems, because the child may become too dependent on approval.Reward systems should be phased out as a child gets older. The child/teen should learn how to set boundaries and say no, so they can be safe.

, Treat the child's communication (verbal and nonverbal) with respect, and always presume competence. Talk regularly to the child so they know what's going on and what's in your mind. That way, the child will trust you and talk to you if a problem arises.

"
"
Call a meeting of caregivers.,
Use praise and/or tertiary reinforcers to encourage the child.,
Develop a BIP (Behavior Intervention Plan) also, especially if the child is likely to engage in SIB (self-injurious behavior) should the reward not be earned.

,
Encourage everyone to be firm about the plan.,
Talk to the child and then implement the plan.,
When the child earns the reward, they will quickly figure out that using the new behavior is better than using the maladaptive one.,
Meet with the implementation team regularly to determine the effectiveness of the plan.,
When the plan is working, make the rewarding more intermittent.,
Relapse into the target behavior may call for re-implementation of the plan for a short period of time.",How to Reduce Maladaptive Behavior in Children with Disabilities3," Bring every person (parents, therapists, teachers, older siblings) who will be involved in replacing the maladaptive behavior. It is best if everyone meets at the same time and place so that no misunderstandings can exist.


One team member should take notes or record the meeting.






Describe and define the target behavior so that there is no confusion as to exactly what the problem is.







, A tertiary reinforcer is something above and beyond what the child normally has as a part of daily living. Examples include a special movie, earning money towards a purchase of a book or toy, etc.


Removal of something normally found in the child's life is considered punitive. It is best to avoid that for this purpose.

,, Those involved must agree to stick to the plan, and not give in even if the child throws a tantrum in hopes of getting the reward. When the behavior arises, give a warning, and make the decision final if the child continues.


Giving in to a tantrum will hurt the child in the long run. If you do this, you have destroyed the plan and will need to create a new one in most instances.

, In the beginning, clearly explain to the child that it upsets them to see you struggling, and that you want to help them cope with it. If possible, talk to them about ways that they could cope with the trigger.


Present a clear coping mechanism that they can use in place of the maladaptive behavior. Simply telling the child ""stop biting your arms"" will leave them confused about how to deal with overwhelming emotions. Telling them ""instead, you can bite on these chewy bracelets and take a break if you need to"" will help them envision how they can act constructively.
Don't feel discouraged if the child doesn't start improving right away. Learning new coping behaviors takes time, and there may be a delay before the child understands what to do.

, There may be some lapses, due to severe distress or confusion, but in time the child will begin to use the better coping method all the time.

, If you see a spike in the target behavior, don't worry, because it is almost always temporary. Continue encouraging the child to adapt and it will eventually happen.

, After a certain amount of time in which the child hasn't behaved maladaptively, modify any rewards. Make longer stretches in between rewards, or increase the number of points to be earned. The plan can be faded out gradually until you no longer need it.

,


Check up with a relapsing child. Relapses may be due to stress or overwhelming feelings. Identify any new sources of stress in the child's life (the death of a grandfather, a new school, the introduction of manipulative compliance therapy) and remove them or help the child work through them.

"
"
Approach the child the same way you would approach one of their peers––with kindness and respect.,
Learn about the child's disability.,
Assume that the child is competent and well-meaning.If you hold positive expectations of the child, then he or she will seek to meet those expectations.,
Respect the child's differences.,
Work to include the child in the community.,
Be careful about the strategies you use and the people whom you consult.,
Help the child meet other disabled people, and present him or her with stories of disabled people (fictional and real).,
Accept the child for who he or she is.",How to Respect Children with Disabilities," If you treat a disabled 8-year-old the same way you would treat a non-disabled 4-year-old, she or he is going to pick up on that and feel insulted.


If the disabled child seems to be struggling with something, offer to help the same way you would to a non-disabled child: ""Do you need help with that?"".
As you get to know the child, you will naturally learn the best way to communicate with him or her, just as you would for other children.;
, To educate yourself, you can: Ask other disabled adults (some of whom write informative internet articles), check out organizations run by disabled adults, read relevant books, and talk to the child's parents/caregivers. The child may also be able to give you information about his or her needs directly.

, Become a model of respectful behavior, and the child will follow you.


Talk to the child, even if he or she isn't capable of talking. Chances are, the child can understand some or all of what you're saying, and will feel pleased that you respect him or her. (Consider the presence of nonspeaking autistic writers and activists, such as Amy Sequenzia.Nonverbal people can be very intelligent.)
If the child engages in harmful behavior, try to figure out what caused it,rather than leaping to a punishment right away.Talk with the child, not at him or her.

, Don't teach a child to be ashamed of his or her accessibility equipment, therapists, or coping methods (for example, stimming). If the child isn't hurting anyone, he or she has no reason to be ashamed. Instead of teaching disabled children to look normal, teach others to accept differences.

, Enlist other adults to find ways that the child can participate in activities (for example, field trip destinations where wheelchair ramps are easily accessible, a pleasant and quiet room at school where an anxious child can take a break).


Ask the child how certain situations might be made more accessible to him or her. He or she may have great ideas!
Educate the child's peers so they can become part of the supportive community. Teach them about the child's disability, and tell them how to behave towards people who are different.

, Some disability-related disciplines focus on eradicating signs of differences, rather than promoting what is best for the child. Disabled children have been accused of lying when they cry for help,subjected to compliance therapies that open the door to abuseand PTSD,restrained and secluded,and more. Use a critical eye and don't accept anything that you suspect will frighten, undermine, physically injure, or traumatize the child. (Yes, this happens.)


Apply this perspective to organizations also, as some of these encourage this behavior.
Remember it this way: Work with the child, not against the child. For example, instead of holding downa screaming child, calmly tell the child that his or her behavior is not appropriate, and work on solutions and alternative modes of communication once the child is calmer.

, This will help build the child's self-esteem and teach him or her that a good life is possible if you are disabled.


Disabled people can also share tips and coping strategies with each other. They can connect in a way that others can't.

, Build upon his or her strengths, help the child to overcome or get around any weaknesses, and teach him or her that disability has nothing to do with human dignity. Your unconditional support will build the child's self-esteem and prepare him or her for a happy and fulfilling life.

Consider whether the stim is actually harmful.,
Do not attempt to stop stims because they look weird.,
Consider whether it is worth the energy to redirect.,
Figure out what triggers the stim.,
Consider what need the child is trying to address.,
Go to the autistic community.,
Draw up a list of alternative ways to fulfill the need.,
Take the child aside and explain your feelings about their harmful stim.,
Have a dialogue about the stim.,
Talk about how you can help.,
Discuss prevention for stims that only arise under distress.,
Give gentle reminders if you notice them using the harmful stim again.,
Be compassionate if they are upset.,
Congratulate them when they successfully use the new stim or ask for help.,
Give your child plenty of exercise.,
Offer plenty of positive stimming activities.,
Protect your child from anti-autism influences.,
Work on your child's strengths too.,
Keep communication open.,
Practice patience.,
Shower them with love.",How to Redirect an Autistic Child's Harmful Stims," Just because a stim is a little odd or noticeable doesn't mean that it's a bad stim. A stim is bad if it fulfills one or more of these criteria:


Does it cause physical harm? (biting, head-banging)
Does it pose a health risk? (placing objects in the mouth, spinning until she falls down)
Does it make a mess or destroy things? (ripping paper)
Does it violate others' personal space? (playing with their hair without permission)
Does the autistic child say they want to change the stim?;
, As a parent, teacher, or educator, it's understandable to be worried about autistic children being bullied. However, modifying the child's behavior for this reason sends the message that bullying is the natural consequence of looking different, and it is their fault for failing to be normal. It is the bullies who need the behavior change, not their victim.


Spend part of a day teaching students what autism is, and how to be supportive and helpful.
As a teacher, take bullying very seriously (in all forms, for all victims).
Cultivate an atmosphere of respect for individual differences. Children will model their behavior after yours.

, Teaching takes time and effort. It can be even more effort for the autistic child, if the new stim doesn't work quite as well. Trying to redirect too many stims can harm their self-esteem and ability to focus. Save serious interventions for serious cases.

, What circumstances arise before the child begins stimming? Keep a journal tracking each instance. Here are some examples. (Keep in mind that possibilities are not limited to this list.)


Boredom/sensory seeking
Frustration
Hunger
Fear or pain

, Stimming is a tool. Talk to the child about it if you can, or draw hypotheses based on your log. Here are a few example possibilities:


Pain management
Sensory seeking (heavy work, touch, vestibular, etc.)
Release of pain or emotion
Cry for help or attention

, There is a group of experienced people who know exactly how these stims work—autistic adults. Try reading blogs and reaching out through the #AskAnAutistic hashtag.


Read lists of stims.
Read from autistic adults who had the same stims. What did they use as replacements? Did the replacements work?

, The child can try these out and use the ones that work best.


For a heavy work sensory seeker, try wall push-ups, lifting heavy objects, and grasping the hands and pulling the elbows away from each other.
For a biter, get gum, candy, and chewy jewelry.
For an head-banger, try heavy work, hitting their fist or head against couch cushions, or hitting their head against a glider rocker.

, Make it clear why this stim is not a good one, so that they recognize that there is a good reason for them to stop. Then propose your suggestions.


""It worries me when I see you hitting your head like that. You could hurt yourself. I'm sure it's not fun for you either. What if you tried punching pillows, or hitting your head against couch cushions instead?""
Many nonverbal children can understand spoken words, even if they look inattentive. Explain it even if you aren't sure that they can understand.

, Ask your child if they have any ideas for replacement stims, and what they think would help them use the harmful stim less. If their ideas are incorporated into the plan, it helps them feel ownership of the process.


""Do you think chewy jewelry would help?"" ""Would you like to help me pick out some jewelry from the website?""
""This is the list of ideas I wrote. What do you think? Should we add or change anything?""
""Let's go to the store this afternoon, and you can pick out the stim toys you want to try.""

, Your support can help the child transition. For example, if your son puts objects in his mouth, and the two of you decide that gum is better, he may not have gum on hand all the time. Make it clear that whenever he wants gum, all he needs to do is ask, and you'll give it to him.

, For example, if your student hits herself when she's upset, talk to her about what makes her so upset, and what you can do to help. Maybe she can't handle noisy classrooms, or she's struggling with English, or she has an underlying condition that's giving her headaches. Address the underlying problem and the bad stim may disappear.

, They may use the stim unconsciously, forget about the alternatives, et cetera. Speak patiently so that they know you aren't mad at them. Ask them what they should do, or remind them what they should do.


""LeBron, is that food? Does it belong in your mouth?"" ""What belongs in your mouth?""
""What do we do when we want to play with hair?""
""Remember, when we want to spin, we stop before we get dizzy. Your trampoline is right over there if spinning isn't enough.""

, Autistic children may revert to harmful stims if they are under large amounts of stress. Use a very patient tone of voice, and ask as little of them as possible to avoid further stressing them. If they are in danger of harming themselves, give a gentle reminder. Otherwise, choose to remind them once they're calm or just let it slide.


""Julie, I understand you're upset and hurting. Why don't we put a pillow between your hands and your head so you don't injure yourself?""
""Please don't bite yourself. Here's your stress ball and chewy toy. Would you like to take one?""
""Rosario, I saw that you were hitting yourself this morning. You seemed very upset, and I was worried about you. Would you like to talk about what happened?""
Avoid grabbing or crowding them, as they may panic and lash out.

, While they probably understand why they should do it, a little encouragement from you never hurts. It will help them remember to keep working on it, feel proud of their progress, and use healthy stims to keep everyone happy and safe.


""LeBron, I'll get you a carrot right away. Thank you for asking.""
""Rosario, I'm glad that you told me that the classroom was too loud as soon as it started bothering you. You didn't hit yourself once! Feel free to come to me any time you're getting really upset.""
""Julie, I just wanted to say how brave and strong you were, head-butting the couch cushions today instead of punching yourself. You did a wonderful job handling your frustration, and I'm proud of you.""

, Activity can help boost mood, improve general health, and moderate the need to stim. Try taking walks, swinging, hiking, climbing, swimming, biking, and whatever the autistic child might enjoy.

, Stimming is important to your child's sense of well-being. Here are some items you can keep around the house for them to interact with:


Beanbag chair
Swing
Fidget toys (tangles, stress balls, and more)
Floor trampoline
Lava lamps and fans to watch

, Some therapists will try to force compliance, extinguish stimming, or do other things that harm your child. Only take your child to therapy that they enjoy (or at minimum, feel neutral towards). Make it clear to other adults that your child's differences are to be respected.


ABA is known for ethical issues. However, some therapy is labeled as ABA for tax reasons, but is based on a foundation of consent. Use your own sense of morals and observe your child's reaction to know if it is ethical.
Autism cannot be cured or ethically suppressed. If someone is claiming that they can do this, beware.

, Encourage their special interests and other abilities. Find ways to make them feel competent and talented. Growing up is not only about improving one's weaknesses, but building upon one's strengths.

, Honor all the child's communication attempts—speech, typing and other forms of AAC, gestures, and behavior. Paying attention to the child's communication encourages them to communicate more. Help them learn to recognize their needs and ask for help when they need it.

, Your child faces many everyday struggles that non-disabled people never have to worry about. If you were in their situation, you'd cry and melt down too. Treat them with compassion, and presume competence, and treat them like they want to behave well.

, Your child is a person with feelings. Show that you care about them (including the autistic parts of them), and that they are not a burden or tragedy in your eyes. Your acceptance and love are what they need most of all.

Hold the school accountable for doing a “Transitional Assessment” prior to implementing any recommendations or plans.","How to Review an Individual Transition Plan (ITP), Autism Spectrum Disorder1","


They are complex and require significant time to teach, absorb and become effective for life after school. Many schools do not start them until the student is fifteen or sixteen years old.

Look for, on the team, an employment specialist, a community living specialist, a psychotherapist, a representative from the school who is empowered to make commitments and assign services at the time of the meeting.
Include also (as needed) a safety instructor, an independent living instructor, a special education or resource teacher, the school's principal or representative, and possibly someone from a higher education option or the bureau of rehabilitation services.
Inviting neighbors, friends of the student, an advocate or other as you deem necessary is your choice and permissible choice. Notify the LEA (Local Educational Authority, who is the person who is able to broker services at the time of the meetings).
There is often a physical and/or occupational therapist present, depending on whether the student uses or needs those types of services.

Consider the cause of your child’s meltdown.,
Find ways to make home life more comfortable for your child.,
Teach stress management techniques to your child.,
Notice when the child is stressed, and validate their feelings.,
Model positive behavior for your child.,
Create a quiet space for your child.,
Keep a meltdown log.,
Talk to your child about hitting and bad behavior.,
Contact one of the child’s other caregivers for assistance during a meltdown.",How to Reduce Meltdowns and Tantrums in Autistic Children1," A meltdown is when an autistic person can no longer handle the bottled-up stress that they have been holding back, and it is released in an outburst that looks like a tantrum. Your child’s meltdown was most likely caused by something that is frustrating him. Autistic children don't melt down because they want to be difficult, but because of something stressful. They may be trying to say that they cannot cope with a situation, stimulus, or routine change. They may melt down out of frustration or as a last resort if other communication attempts fail.


Meltdowns can take many forms. They may involve screaming, crying, covering ears, self-injurious behavior, or occasionally aggression.;
, Since meltdowns come from pent-up stress, creating a friendlier environment can minimize stressors in the child's life.


Follow a routine to give your child a sense of stability. Creating a picture schedule can help them visualize the routine.If changes have to occur, it is best to prepare your child for these changes by showing them the changes that are to be made through pictures or social stories. Explain why the change will occur. This will help your child understand what to expect and be calm when it happens.
Allow your child to leave stressful situations as needed.

, Some autistic children do not understand how to deal with their emotions and may need extra guidance. Congratulate your child when they successfully demonstrate stress management techniques.


Come up with plans for specific stressors (loud noises, crowded rooms, etc.).
Teach self-calming techniques: deep breathing, counting, taking breaks, etc.
Have a plan for how a child can tell you if something is bothering them.

, Treating their needs as natural and important will help them learn that it's okay to express them.


""I see your face is all scrunched up. Is the loud thumping bothering you? I can ask your sisters to go play outside.""
""You seem angry today. Would you like to tell me why you're upset?""

, Your child observes you when you're stressed, and learns to mimic your coping behaviors. Keeping your cool, clearly expressing your feelings, and taking quiet time when you need it will help your child learn to do the same.


Consider narrating your choices. ""I'm feeling upset right now, so I'm going to take a quick break and take some deep breaths. Then I'll be right back.""
After you use a behavior several times, the child is likely to try it out for themselves.

, It is important to recognize your child may have difficulties processing and regulating multiple sights, sounds, smells and textures. Too much stimulation and your child can become stressed, overwhelmed, and prone to meltdowns. In this circumstance, a quiet room can help the child calm down.Teach the child to signal that they need the room. They can point to the room, show a picture card representing the room, use sign language, type, or ask verbally.
Read How to Make a Calming Down Corner for additional tips.

, Keeping a record of each time that your child has a meltdown can also help you to understand the reasons for the behavior. Try answering the following questions in writing the next time your child has a meltdown:


What made the child upset? (Consider that the child may have been holding back stress for hours.)
What signs of stress did the child exhibit?
If you noticed any stress buildup, what did you do? Was it effective?
How could you prevent a similar meltdown in the future?

, Remember that autism is not an excuse for hitting or being mean. If the child is mean to others, talk to him once they have calmed down. Explain that the particular action was not acceptable, and tell them what they can do instead.


""It was not okay for you to hit your brother. I understand that you were upset, but hitting hurts people, and it's not okay to hurt people when you're angry. If you're mad, you can take some deep breaths, take a break, or tell me about the problem.""

, Autistic people have been traumatized or killed in the hands of the police.If you cannot handle a meltdown, get one of the child's other caregivers to help you.


Only call the police in extreme, physically harmful situations. Police may respond violently to your child, which could cause symptoms of PTSD and lead to worse meltdowns."
"
Consider how your actions can affect your child's tantrums.,
Address tantrum behavior early.,
Ignore tantrum behavior.,
Intervene if the child is being mean or doing dangerous things.,
Invite your child to behave better.",How to Reduce Meltdowns and Tantrums in Autistic Children2," Children throw tantrums when they want something and do not get it. By acting out, the child may hope to get what they want in the end. If you give the child what they want (e.g. ice cream, or a delayed bathtime/bedtime), then the child will learn that tantrums are a good way to get things.

, It is much easier to start addressing tantrums when the autistic person is a child. For example, a 6-year-old boy who throws himself on the floor is much easier to manage compared to a 16-year-old. Also, the child will be less likely to cause injury to themself or others., Planned ignoring can work best for yelling, swearing, and sulking. This will teach the child that the behavior is not an effective way to get attention. It helps to clearly communicate this idea, such as ""I can't understand what's wrong if you're pouting back there. But if you would like to calm down a little and explain what is wrong, I would be happy to listen to you.""

, Always step in if the child begins throwing things, taking things that belong to others, or hitting. Ask the child to stop and then explain why the behavior is not okay.

, Tell your child that they can choose to act in a way that will get the desired response. Explaining this to your child will help your child understand the best way to get what they want (or at least a listening ear or a compromise).


For example, you can tell your child, ""If you'd like me to help you, you can take a few deep breaths and tell me what's wrong. I'm here for you if you need me.""

"
"
Stay “Ahead” of the problem.,
Use the A-B-C journal to identify ""triggers"" for your child.,
Discuss your ABC journal with a therapist.",How to Reduce Meltdowns and Tantrums in Autistic Children3," Keep a record (preferably in a writing journal) of when the meltdown regularly occurs e.g. before an outing, before a bath, at bedtime, etc. Write down the A-B-C (antecedents, behaviors, consequences) of the problem. Doing this will allow you to figure out your child’s behavior and what it is that you can do to help prevent and address problems as they occur.Antecedents: What were the factors leading up to the meltdown (time, date, place, and incident)? How did these factors influence the problem? Were you doing anything that was painful or upsetting to the child?

Behaviors: What were the specific behaviors exhibited by the child?

Consequences: What were the consequences of the child’s actions for the mentioned behaviors? What did you do as a result? What happened to the child?

, Then use this knowledge to teach your child the “if – then”. For example, if the child is upset that another person has broken his toy, then it is a good time to ask for help., After you have collected your ABC information, it is a good idea to share this information with a therapist to provide a good picture of your child’s behavior in specific scenarios.

"
"
Help your child express basic needs.,
Teach your child to try to identify their own emotions.,
Remain calm and consistent.,
Assume that your child wants to behave well.,
Explore alternative communication.",How to Reduce Meltdowns and Tantrums in Autistic Children4," If they can communicate the thing that is bothering them, they are less likely to build up stress or resort to bad behavior.Your child needs to know how to say or communicate the following:


""I'm hungry.""
""I'm tired.""
""I need a break, please.""
""That hurts.""

, Many autistic children have trouble understanding their feelings, and it may be helpful for them to point to pictures or learn the physical symptoms that accompany feelings. Explain that telling people how they feel (such as ""The grocery store makes me scared"") allows people to help fix problems (such as ""You can wait outside with your big sister while I finish shopping"").


Make it clear that if they communicate, you will listen to them. This eliminates the need for a tantrum.

, The meltdown-prone child will need a calm, stable parental figure as well as consistency from all those involved with their care. You will not be able to address your child’s self-control until you have control of yourself first., This is called ""presuming competence"" and it greatly improves autistic people's social skills. Autistic people are much more likely to open up if they feel that they will be respected.

, If an autistic child is not ready for speech, there are other ways to have him communicate with you. Try sign language, typing, picture exchange systems, or whatever a therapist recommends.

"
"
Know that your actions can affect your child’s meltdowns.,
Treat your child with respect.,
Consider medication.,
Seek the help of a therapist.,
Make steps easier for your child.,
Use social stories, picture books, and playtime to teach good behavior.,
Consider a reward system.,
Give your child plenty of love and attention.",How to Reduce Meltdowns and Tantrums in Autistic Children5," For example, if you continue doing something that upsets your child (such as exposing them to painful sensory stimuli or pushing something they don't want), they may lash out. Children melt down more frequently if they believe that it's the only way to make parents acknowledge their feelings and desires., Coercing him, ignoring the fact that they are not comfortable with something, or physically restraining him is damaging. Respect your child's autonomy.


Obviously, you cannot always honor a ""no."" If you are not going to do what they want, tell them why: ""It's important that you sit in the car seat because it keeps you safe. If we get in an accident, the car seat will protect you.""
If something bothers him, find out why, and try to fix the problem. ""Is the car seat uncomfortable? Would it help if you sat on a little pillow?""

, Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antipsychotic medications, and mood stabilizers can be partially effective in helping children who are easily upset. However, like with any medication, there are side effects, so you must take the time to really decide if medication is the best option.There is enough research data to show that a medication by name Risperidone is quite effective for the short-term treatment of aggressive and self-injurious behaviors in autistic children. Speak with a doctor or therapist about the pros and cons of this medication.

, A therapist can help your child improve in their communication as well. Be sure to find one that works with autistic children. Your doctor or many of the good autism spectrum disorder support groups will be able to help find a recommended therapist., For example if your child does not like to get dressed, break up the complex process into basic ""one-at-a-time"" steps. This will help you understand where some of the difficulties are with your child undertaking a particular activity. As such, without even speaking, your child is communicating with you about a concern they have., The library is full of children's books that teach skills, and you can teach skills through play time as well.


For example, if one of your dolls is angry, you can have that doll step off to the side to take deep breaths. The child will learn that this is what people do when they are angry.

, Work with a specialist to implement a reward system so your child can be rewarded for remaining calm. Rewards can involve praise (""You did such a good job handling that crowded grocery store! That was very nice deep breathing""), gold stars on a calendar, or physical rewards. Help your child feel proud of their accomplishments., When your child has a strong bond with you, they will learn to come to you when they need help and listen to you.

Make your goal comfort, not sitting still.,
Give the child plenty of exercise during other parts of the day.,
Try a sensory seat wedge.,
Try a beanbag, or a weighted toy or blanket.,
Consider letting them sit on an exercise ball sometimes.,
Provide some basic stim toys.,
While experimenting with different ideas, do fun things together.",How to Teach an Autistic Child to Sit in a Chair," Autistic children usually need more sensory input than the average child, so a bit of fidgeting is natural to keep them comfortable. Try different things so that the child is happy to sit in the chair, and that their fidgeting does not interfere with their concentration.


Talk to them about ""sitting calmly:"" sitting in the chair, fidgeting as needed, and being able to focus.
If they can't ""sit calmly,"" then they need a way to get more sensory input. Teach them to recognize this, and ask for a break to stim or move around. Learning to ask for a break is an important skill for autistic children.;
, Exercise provides an outlet for excess energy and improves mood (among other benefits). Try to incorporate time outdoors into the child's daily routine. This way, they won't need to fidget constantly.

, Seat wedges provide extra sensory input, reducing the need to fidget and wiggle. Explain to the child that the wedge is like a cushion, and will help them sit calmly.


Sit on the wedge to demonstrate that it is comfortable and safe.
Seat wedges may come with tactile bumps. Explain how they can run their fingers along the bumps.

, These provide deep pressure, which helps them feel grounded. They can also gently fidget by feeling the fabric and beads inside it.

, They can bounce on it slightly while still concentrating on what's in front of them, and it provides an outlet for excess energy. Additionally, it can help with balance problems (something many autistic children struggle with).

, Mild to moderate stimming can improve focus (in neurotypicals as well as autistic people). Try giving the child a stress ball, a tangle, a tiny beanbag, or something they can manipulate in one hand while their other hand works on the task before them.


Experiment with different stim toys and find out what the child likes best.
Get a bin of different stim toys. Before the child goes to sit down, ask them to run to the bin and pick out a stim toy to use at their chair.

, Try playing board games on the table, drawing pictures together, or reading a fun story. Let the child take breaks to jump around and stim if needed. This will help them learn that sitting can be enjoyable.

Learn more about cerebral palsy.,
Start treatment goals as early as possible.,
Ask a therapist about goal-directed functional therapy (GDT) and whether this is a realistic goal for young children.,
Continue recommended therapy at home.,
Be aware that children with cerebral palsy experience more pain and fatigue than other children.Sensory problems may be distressing to the child and impact on their behavior.,
Work with a physical therapist that has experience with children with cerebral palsy.,
Try aquatherapy or swimming therapy.,
Take advantage of occupational therapy in setting treatment goals.,
Set realistic goals in communication.,
Have your child tested for a cognitive or mental disability as he or she reaches school age.,
Stay involved as a member of your child's IEP team at school.",How to Set Realistic Goals for Children With Cerebral Palsy," For one thing, it's not a single disorder but a group of disorders that result in a range of limitations or difficulties.


Cerebral palsy most often affects motor skills, although it can also affect speech and cognitive abilities.
Children with severe cerebral palsy may need total care throughout their lives.
Other children with mild cerebral palsy can be totally independent.
What is most important is basing realistic goals on an individual's strengths and weaknesses.;
, Children with a developmental disability do best with early treatment started right after diagnosis.


Therapy changes as a child with cerebral palsy grows older. Young adults have different needs than preschool children.
Realistic goals for early treatment are motor skills.
Therapists focus on communication and mobility for school-age children.
The emphasis for adolescents is on self-care and independence.

,


Studies have shown that GDT is more successful for helping children with cerebral palsy improve with everyday activities, particularly gross motor skills.,


A therapist should not only help the child with a disability, but should also act as a teacher or coach for the family so realistic goals can be pursued in the home environment.
Incorporating treatment into daily life often leads to greater progress.

,, Common problems that can be addressed in physical therapy are:


Addressing too stiff or too floppy muscle tone.
Improving muscle coordination related to ataxia.
Gait problems, such as scissored gait, walking on toes or dragging one leg.
Reducing pain that comes from tight muscles and deformity.
Improving a child's mobility with adaptive equipment. Some children will walk without an aid, but others may need orthotics, crutches, walkers or power wheelchairs to get around.

, This may be useful in developing gross motor skills. The water makes it a low-impact form of exercise, and it can be cheap and commonly-accessible., In general, an occupational therapist is going to concentrate more on upper body needs and fine motor skills needed for feeding, dressing and writing.


In the early years, occupational and physical therapists may overlap as a realistic goal for both therapies is to provide additional stimulation to a child's environment.
Therapies recommended for fine motor skills in hemiplegic cerebral palsy include bimanual training (reminding the child to use both hands together), and constraint-induced movement therapy (temporarily restricting the movement of the 'good arm' to force the child to rely on the 'bad arm'). Bimanual training is easier to incorporate into daily life, and constraint-induced movement therapy is more intensive.An occupational therapist can help an adolescent or older child achieve greater independence.

, Although mobility is an important skill, probably the most important skill for anyone is a means of communication. This becomes more important as a child reaches school age.


Some children with cerebral palsy may benefit from traditional speech therapy that focuses on verbal speech patterns.
Children with severe communication deficits are often taught to communicate with sign language and/or electronic communication devices.
Speech therapy treatment goals can and should overlap with cognitive and social skills.

,


Much of a school age child's therapy takes place at school through an IEP (Individual Education Plan).
A child must first qualify for an IEP, which is decided after testing. Testing is also used to set up treatment goals at school.

, You are your child's best advocate.


An IEP team includes your child's teacher, a regular education teacher, therapists, a school administrator, parent and child.
An IEP sets up realistic goals for the school year.
Realistic goals may be to modify curricula, therapies and special accommodations.
If a child has difficulty with speech or severe motor dysfunction, their intelligence may be underestimated.
Goals must be active and measurable.

Start early.,
Choose the right place and time.,
Expect them to possess some prior knowledge.,
Talk about sex more than once.",How to Discuss Sex with Your Child1," If you get an indication that your child is being exposed to sexual information, then it is time to start talking with them yourself. Even infants are curious about their bodies, and by preschool age they may show an intellectual curiosity regarding others' bodies as well as their own. By eight years old many kids are ready to have some form of a sex conversation with you. Remember to keep the conversation age appropriate, too. You don’t need to provide all of the biological details to a young child, but it is important to let them know you are there to talk.By middle school your teen will likely have had at least one brief sexual education discussion in class. This is a good age range to clarify any biological information or details that may be confusing. When your child reaches high school, you may want to focus your attention on safe sex, including STD prevention.;
, It is best to discuss sex when you and your child are alone. This will allow both of you to be honest and straightforward without worrying about peer pressure or embarrassment. Many parents find that the car is a great place to talk. Or, you and your child could talk while taking a walk.It is often helpful to talk about potentially uncomfortable subjects in the middle of completing a familiar activity. For example, you might want to initiate conversation in the middle of a basketball game, if you and your child regularly play together.
Consider your family dynamic. Some children may be more comfortable having initial conversations with parents, guardians, or a close relative of the same biological sex.

, Be aware that your child has probably been exposed to a wide variety of sexual information fairly early on. The internet, radio, and TV all express sexualized messages on a regular basis. You might start the conversation with your child by asking them what they’ve seen or heard.For example, you might say, “You had the sex ed class in school today. Do you have any questions about what you learned? Did anything concern or confuse you?”
To gauge what kind of sexual information your child is encountering, try flipping through their favorite magazines. Or, listen to their music.

, Consider your conversation with your child as one that is ongoing and continual. Look for opportunities in your daily life when you can bring up the subject or provide them with some useful information. Pop culture provides many such opportunities. If you both are watching a TV show that mentions a sexual myth, go ahead and correct it for your child. Normalizing the conversations can help your child better understand in the long run.Also, be aware that you could overwhelm, or scare, your child if you try to lump everything that you want them to know into one talk. Instead, purposefully spread this information out over time, building a relationship built on trust and open communication."
"
Use biological names.,
Explain intercourse in a clear and direct way.,
Talk about love, too.,
Discuss LGBT+ issues with your child.,
Talk about peer pressure and sexual assault.,
Stress the importance of safe sex.,
Show them materials created by a sex health care professional.",How to Discuss Sex with Your Child2," Labeling sexual body parts with fake names or nicknames may only confuse or delay your child’s understanding of their body. It also makes the act of sex and the body seem more private than it should be. You want to foster an open conversation. Call the sexual body parts by their proper name.For example, you might say, “Girls and women have vaginas. Boys and men have penises.”
Of course, how you describe your child’s body may change as they mature. Many people feel more comfortable employing body part nicknames until a child reaches the age of 3 or so.

, When your child asks for a description of how sex occurs it is best to offer a quick, clear description that leaves room for them to ask follow-up questions. You might talk about how the sperm can join with an egg and then that egg becomes a baby. This is a better way to approach the subject when compared with a “stork” discussion.For example, you could say, “You can get pregnant after having sex only once, as it only takes one time for a sperm and egg to join.”

, If you just talk about sex as a biological act, then your child may grow to view it as such. Make sure to emphasize the way that love often plays a part in sexual relationships. This is a great way to acknowledge the strong feelings that your child may be experiencing while also telling them that you can express love in other ways aside from sex.You might say, “What are some other ways of showing a person that you love them?”

, Your child may ask you directly about diverse sexual relationships. Talk about how some people of the same gender also partake in sexual and romantic relationships. If they are curious about these relationships, go online and research LGBT+ issues alongside your child.


You could ask, “Do you have any questions about LGBT relationships?”

, Sexual bullying is, unfortunately, becoming increasingly common at schools. Teach your children how to identify sexual pressure, as connected to peer pressure. Emphasize the benefits of saying, “No,” in uncomfortable situations. Let your child know that unauthorized touching or sex is never okay and that it is never their fault if something does happen.For example, you might tell your child, “No always means no. If someone asks you to stop, do so. And, if you ask someone to stop, then they should respect your words.”
Both girls and boys need to understand the problems associated with sexual peer pressure. Make sure to have this conversation regardless of your child’s gender.

, Tell your child that their safety is your first and foremost concern. Make safe sex a non-negotiable point in your conversation. Explain to them that sexual transmitted diseases can be carried and transmitted very easily unless sexual partners take the proper precautions, including testing. Discuss the use of contraceptive methods and how to prevent an unplanned pregnancy as well.You might say, “The decision to have unprotected sex can have many long-term consequences. Some STDs can stay with you for a lifetime.”

, You and your child can always sit down at the computer and search “sexual education materials” online. Then, you can both go through the information that your search turns up. Offer to purchase or download any books that your child expresses interest in.As you look through various books online, you might ask, “Would you like to order a few of these, so that you can look through them on your own as well?”

Stay calm and collected.,
Avoid speaking in all “don’ts.” Many children avoid talking to their parents about sex because they don’t want another negative lecture.,
Avoid shaming them.,
Listen to your child.,
Ask them if they have any questions.",How to Discuss Sex with Your Child3," You and your child will most likely both be nervous during these sex talks. But, as a parent, you establish the emotional cues and it is important that you keep a level head and calm demeanor. Do not laugh at your child’s questions and try to provide a response that demonstrates your respect of their curiosity.If you are especially nervous, it may help to practice this conversation with another adult before talking to your child. This could prepare you for, at least some of, the awkward moments.
Consider bringing the topic up slowly over time so that you and your child both eventually feel more comfortable talking calmly about the matter with one another.

, Instead, try to take a different tone with your child. Stick to proactive subjects, such as what they can do to stay sexually healthy. Talk about how they can avoid peer pressuring their romantic partners and how they should respond if pressured.For example, instead of saying, “Don’t get pregnant,” you might talk with your child about birth control or condoms.

, Be supportive regardless of whether your child discusses their playground crush or how they’ve started to explore masturbation. Try not to judge them for their actions. Instead, ask questions, so that you more fully understand your child’s behavior and can offer better advice.When in doubt, you can always emphasize the natural basis of many of your child’s actions. If they are embarrassed about their actions, you can just say, “That is natural and normal.”

, As the more experienced person, you may expect to do most of the talking during these conversations, but it is far better to be an active listener. Show your child that you are listening by nodding your head or making sounds of agreement. Create more engagement by seeing what they already know and addressing any misconceptions that may arise. Ask questions when they’ve finished speaking and pay attention to the answers.You can also show that you are listening by bringing up the conversation later on and asking follow-up questions. Try your best to avoid interrupting your child.

, At the end of each talk, make sure to ask them if they have any lingering questions that they would like to talk about. Emphasize that your door is always open if anything comes to mind. To add trust, you might tell them that you’ll come to them if you have any questions, too.

Choose a good location.,
Plan activities that both kids will enjoy.,
Serve healthy, yummy snacks.,
Turn off all screen devices.",How to Plan Successful Play Dates for Your ADD/ADHD Child1," You can be selective about whom you invite to play with your child.If you find that your child always gets in fights with a certain child, spend less time with that child.


Many children with ADHD are developmentally delayed by a year or two. It may help to invite a younger child over for a play date so that the children are matched in development.;
, Many children with ADHD get over-excited or anxious in situations with lots of kids. The amount of noise and chaos can be overwhelming, and can contribute to inappropriate behavior. Choose one child to play with. This allows your child to focus on that friend without getting distracted by too much activity.

, The length of the play date should be relatively brief, depending on age. After a stronger relationship between your child and the other child has developed, you can think about lengthening the play date.Start with one to two hours. Take note of when your child starts to get overwhelmed or frustrated. This is a good time to give your child a heads-up that you'll be leaving the playdate.
Be flexible, however. If you see that your child is doing well and is not overwhelmed during the play date, allow him more time to enjoy himself.

, The location is just as important for your child as the playmate. If your child gets overexcited around lots of kids, skip meeting at the playground. Instead, have a play date at your house.

, Have a game plan ahead of time so you know the types of activities you’ll be doing. Get out the Legos, set up an obstacle course in the yard, or set up an art table with paints.


Let your child choose a couple of his favorite activities so he feels like he has some control over the play date.
If you need to divert attention away from one particular activity, you’ll want to have a backup activity. You may also need to change things up more frequently, depending on the ages of the children at the play date.

, Kids will inevitably need snacks at a play date. Make sure you serve something healthy, but it should also be something that kids enjoy.


Choose snacks that give your child good energy. Skip foods with refined sugars and artificial dyes and colors, as these tend to provide little nutrition. Serve fresh fruits and vegetables to offer plenty of nutrients and vitamins instead.
Although it is a common belief that sugar negatively impacts children with ADHD, several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a link between sugar and adverse effects on the behavior of children with ADHD. Sugar is full of empty calories, however, so it's best avoided.

, Let the children interact with each other. After all, you’re having a playdate to help your child develop social skills and build friendships. Turn off computers, tablets, phones and videogames. Send the kids out to the yard, or help them set up board games or other activities."
"
Try role playing to prepare your child.,
Practice taking turns and sharing.,
Review good manners.",How to Plan Successful Play Dates for Your ADD/ADHD Child2," Decrease the potential for anxiety by role playing it. In addition to providing familiarity and a comfort level for the upcoming event, role playing allows you to see how your child might react, and then guide him in appropriate responses. This is especially helpful in prepping to meet new people or going to a new house.

, During playtime at home with family, give your child time to practice sharing.Have siblings be role models for your child with ADHD.


Your child might also observe your other children having play dates with their friends. Consistency is key, so make sure your other children are also using the same rules and guidelines that you’re setting out for your child with ADHD.

, A play date is a great time to practice good manners.Observe the rule that guests are always right. Your child should say “please,” “thank you,” and “excuse me” when talking with his friend or his friend’s parent.


Talk with your child about how to respond to boredom. If your child is getting bored with an activity, he can suggest a new activity with friendly words. Instead of saying, “That’s a stupid game,” he can say, “Let’s play this other game instead.”
Remind your child to thank his friend for the playdate.

"
"
Observe your child's behavior during the play date.,
Let your child be the host.,
Allow the kids to resolve conflicts.,
Give praise for your child’s good behavior.,
Discuss the visit with your child.",How to Plan Successful Play Dates for Your ADD/ADHD Child3," During the play date, pay close attention to the ways your child interacts with the other child. Notice if behavior patterns emerge. These will give you an indication of what you might need to work on with your child.


For example, if your child keeps getting upset when the other child asks for a toy, you might need to work with your child on sharing.

, While a play date is supervised by a parent, you aren’t necessarily an active participant in the activities. Provide assistance or refereeing when necessary, but let your child be the host. Let him show his friend where the bathroom is, for example.


For young children, such as preschoolers, you’ll probably need to have a more active role in directing the play date.

, Don’t be too quick to step in to fix problems. Let your child negotiate with his guest. It’s important that kids work through some arguments or conflicts on their own. This will help them build self-esteem and understand how to work with others to resolve problems., A child with ADHD needs to feel that he is being praised more often than criticized. Praise your child when he behaves in an appropriate way at the playdate. Even if he only shares one toy instead of three toys, praise that sharing effort. It’s important that you promote the positive behavior and give him positive feedback.The positive input must significantly outweigh the negative input to counterbalance feelings of failure that your child may encounter in a typical day., After the play date is over, talk with your child about it. Ask what parts he liked and what parts he didn’t like. This will help you in planning future play dates.


This type of chat will also help your child feel acknowledged and as though his needs and feelings matter.

"
"
Make sure your child gets plenty of rest.,
Give your child nutritious foods.,
Experiment with eliminating certain foods.,
Get active with your child.",How to Plan Successful Play Dates for Your ADD/ADHD Child4," Every kid is affected when he doesn’t get enough sleep. When you throw ADHD in the mix, managing everyday challenges become that much more difficult. A lack of sleep reduces the child’s ability to focus, learn and retain information, and choose appropriate behavior. Furthermore, a lack of sleep may lead to more tantrums or arguments at a play date.


Help your child practice good sleep habits by establishing a consistent bedtime and wake-up time.
Children need about 10 to 12 hours of sleep every night.Teens need about eight to ten hours of sleep every night., People with ADHD benefit from certain types of foods in order to boost serotonin and dopamine levels and to help with concentration.


For example, experts recommend a diet rich in complex carbohydrates to boost serotonin for improved mood, sleep, and appetite. Skip simple carbs (sugars, honey, jelly, candy, soda, etc.) ) that cause a temporary serotonin spike. Instead, choose complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, green vegetables, starchy vegetables, and beans. These all act as an energy “time-release.” Serve a protein-rich diet that includes several proteins over the course of the day to keep dopamine levels high, which helps improve focus. Proteins include meat, fish, and nuts, as well as several foods that double as complex carbs: legumes and beans. Choose omega-3 fats. ADHD experts recommend avoiding “bad fats” such as those found in trans-fats and fried foods, burgers and pizzas. Instead, choose omega-3 fats from salmon, walnuts, avocados and more, which can help promote brain health.These foods may help lower hyperactivity while improving organizational skills.

, Some studies have suggested that eliminating wheat and dairy, as well as processed foods, sugars, additives and dyes (especially red food coloring), can have a positive impact on behavior in children with ADHD.While not everyone will be willing or able to go to that length, some experimentation may produce improvements that make a difference. Controlled studies have not shown a link between negative effects on children with ADHD and substances such as food dyes. However, reducing processed foods will contribute to your child's overall health.

, A child with ADHD often has excess energy, and he will benefit from being physically active. Exercise helps improve focus and concentration. It also helps ward off depression and anxiety, and it can boost self-confidence. Run around with your child in the yard before the play date begins.

Take a little time to think about the purpose and beauty of patience.,

Show goodwill and interest in children.,
Be grateful for your children and for all children.,

Love being with children.",How to Be Patient With Kids," Patience gives us time to reflect, to slow down and think about the world and the things we're doing. It's a way of enjoying what we're experiencing rather than always rushing toward an end just to make room for the next rush. Patience allows us to enjoy the process of living. Patience also enables others to accept us into their lives through our faithful, continued presence and enduring respect for them. When we accept the importance of patience in our lives, it becomes easier to be patient with others too. Through respecting the rhythm of ourselves and others, being patient presents an opportunity to give of ourselves rather than expecting others to conform to our wants.


See How to be patient for some more general ideas on letting a little more patience into your life.;
, Resist the impulse to have things the way you'd like them to be. Even a very young child can indicate their likes and dislikes; allowing these to express themselves at appropriate occasions is important. As part of asking for the child's preferences, be sure to show that you've heard the answer; aim to paraphrase the child's response so that it's clear you understand.


Resist the temptation to change the child's mind about a future occupation. If little Johnny says he wants to be a window washer when he grows up, let it be. If you constantly interrupt with something like ""Oh he's just saying that. We all know he'll be a doctor when he grows up"", he'll start to resent the implications of being pushed toward a designated career.
Balance the wants with realities. If you think that what the child is asking for is unreasonable, unaffordable, or a sign of ""consumeritis"", take time to talk it through rather than simply saying no or choosing for them without discussion. You don't have to reason with the child but it helps to give a brief explanation. It helps even more if you show by example what you're asking the child to follow.

, Where possible, try to please them. This isn't about being a doormat for the child's commands. It's about respecting the wants and requests of the child within the appropriateness of the situation. Help the child to learn the difference between making a request and making a demand and what the consequences are. It is also important to help them understand the importance of delayed gratification, teaching them that when you do say no, sometimes this is about waiting, rather than never having or doing what they've asked for. Helping them to understand this time perspective is far kinder than simply saying no and not explaining any further.

, When the daily chores mount up and everyone is rushing about, sometimes it's easy to take one another for granted. Taking time now and then to express your gratitude for your children will help you to respect them for the unique, individual beings they are, and helps them to see the importance of valuing others openly.

, Be willing to do things the child's way when possible. While their attempts might sometimes cause you frustration and worry, it is important to allow children to show you their way of doing things. If your child offers to help with making dinner, don't think of the mess they'll make. Accept that there will be a mess but realize that they're learning how to do something that will one day be of great importance as a skill (and eventually, they'll be making some of the household meals, relieving you of the burden occasionally). In watching and learning from your child or from other children, you will learn their character better, and see both their strengths and their weaknesses, giving you an opportunity to help them nurture the best talents and to learn to manage their weaknesses.


If you do not allow children to do things their way, this takes away their autonomy and potentially stunts their ability to discover things for themselves. Allow a child to try new things often, so as to give them a sense of self-trust and personal responsibility.
Naturally, keep safety and propriety in mind; it is entirely appropriate to step in and change the course of a child's behavior or activities where safety or appropriateness have been compromised; this is simply part of being responsible guardians.

, Remember that children have feelings, likes, dislikes, favorite foods, colors, etc. Honor these things when possible.

, Children are ready to trust and soak up information from the people who care for them and spend time with them. Trying to control children lacks respect for their own self and is a way of trying to insert your way of thinking and preferences onto them. Give them space to grow into the individual that they are.


Patience allows you to be the ideal teacher. Instead of seeking to control, patience allows the child to grow at their own pace, rather than being pushed into doing things before being ready. For example, Dino de Laurentiis did not speak until he was 5. Despite the worries of others, his mother took this in her stride, believing he'd speak more than enough when he was ready. And so he did!Try this: see if you can say ""yes"" to the child, before you say ""no"". If your first instinct is to say ""no"", question this. Actually, why not? Are you just being controlling, or is there a good reason to deny their request?

, Most choices are not a life and death situation. Give children a rope long enough for them to safely learn on their own. Mistakes are a learning experience.


If you feel that a situation is getting out of hand with a child, take a step back and create space between you and the child. This breathing space is important for both of you, after which you can express your thoughts and establish boundaries when you are collected, rather than channeling your concerns through frustration.

, Your example will be helpful to your children throughout their life. They will also have learned to make wise choices by the choices you allowed them to make. Now they will be kind to their children and teach them to make wise choices.

, It can be very hard to be patient sometimes in a world where teaching Mozart in the womb and expectations of exemplary behavior from preschool are considered the norm. No matter what the competitive approach insists upon, patience gives you a means for remaining calm within yourself, to give you the perspective to recognize the readiness of a child at their own developmental pace, independent of external standards. Rushing can cause you to lose sight of your guiding role, and of the precious essence of the child.

, Sometimes our greatest impatience arises when we allow our own endeavors such as work, personal pursuits, hobbies, sports, etc., to get in the way of spending time with children. Whether we're parenting, caring, teaching, working or volunteering with children, nobody is immune from impatience at times. If you feel any sense of resentment when being around children for ""holding up"" the things you want to do, or you find yourself ""half present"" instead of giving your full attention, then being patient can restore your joy of spending time with children. Let go of the impatience and realize that time spent with children is precious. It is a time during which you can learn a great deal about seeing the world through fresh eyes. It can also be a time when you realize that you can make a big difference in the life of a child by teaching or showing them something new, and by helping them to love and respect themselves all the more.


Recognize that patience is a form of kindness. Giving time is giving kindness a chance. By removing the pressure of the other ""more pressing"" things you feel, you show your child that there is nothing more important, nothing kinder, than spending time with them.
A child who is given time with an adult soaks up the message that the busyness of adult life can wait, that childhood is a good time, and that there is no need to grow up too quickly. The point of life is being with one another, a gift that can only be imparted to a child in the doing.

Note two important things before reading further:


Realize that every person born has the right to respect and fair treatment.,
Provide a routine.,
Teach relaxation techniques.,
Learn what the child loves to do most.,
Identify the child's areas of growth.,
Teach independence to higher functioning Asperger's children.,
Try not to label such children and describe them as Asperger's.,
Talk to the child about current events.,
Teach the child the reasons behind the behaviours of others.,
Invite classmates over for playdates.",How to Raise an Autistic Child," You must deal with your own anxieties, anger or frustration before you are able to care effectively for another.
Understand what is involved. Kids with Asperger's have special needs. These can range from poor social interactions, to not being able to verbalize.The tips following are general and you will need to tailor them to your child.;
, Every day should be similar for the child. If you can, give the child a calendar with pictures, especially for the older child. This will be helpful for the child to picture upcoming events and expected daily happenings.


Handle change with great kindness and care. Any last minute changes to the usual routine (such as appointments, arrival or departure of guests, and so forth) should be brought up in a frank manner. In this way, the child does not let their anxieties build up.

, Relaxation is a hard skill to teach. The next best thing is a type of breathing called ""box breathing"". You inhale for a count of 4, hold your breath for 4 seconds (if possible) and slowly exhale for a count of 4. Then, pause for 4 seconds before you inhale again. This process allows the child or caregiver to count, which in itself can be relaxing.

, Whether it is reading about animals, building blocks or counting items, the activity that the child enjoys is an important one to the child. Never try to stop them; just ask them questions about the activity, if possible. This shows that you have an interest and helps to build a bond of trust between you and the child. If the child is unable to talk, just being a silent supporter means more than you can imagine.

, This is extremely important for the well-being and development of the child. For example, if you notice that they are not confident in social situations, try role playing with your child to show the child how to start conversations and talk about basic things, such as weather and general or specific interests. Also teach the child how to recognize social cues, such as boredom or anger in others. Role playing is crucial––it gives kids a mock trial of what to expect. Be real, throw them a curve-ball and see what they do. This type of play is excellent when teaching kids how to deal with bullies.

, This is crucial. Treat them no different from any child their age. Give them responsibilities around the house like cooking or cleaning. Self care is an area in which Asperger's children really lack an interest or motivation to undertake. Not that do they not recognize as easily when they are dirty as non-Asperger's children, but they just don't see the importance of taking a bath or keeping clean. Teaching them to take care of themselves is a life-long skill. Having a routine is crucial, even writing down the steps and taping them to the bathroom mirror is a good way to ensure that daily hygiene functions get done.

, These children must learn they are no different from other human beings but are simply part of a broad spectrum of personality types in the world. Help them to see that they are able to achieve as much as they put their minds to. For kids who are higher needs, it is important that you learn to take care of yourself and reach out to support groups so that you can get the help you need.

, Doing this will keep them up to date with the latest information. This can help them to learn the importance of news issues and social norms.

, If you spell out what motivates people and how it is often hard for any person to fathom the actions and thoughts of another person, this will give them an insight into how emotions can affect a person. It can be harder for an Asperger's child to stand in the shoes of another person to try to see that person's perspective but this is a skill that can be taught. Ask things such as: How would this affect you if it happened to you? Do you think that person might also feel confused or upset? If the child seems indifferent, try to use situations or things that the child is interested in, such as a pet, a stuffed toy or a game that the child likes, and come at the teaching from that angle instead.

, This is a good way for your kid to practice their social skills in a less threatening environment. You can slowly increase the number of kids as your child gets better, although don't ever overdo it by having a big group––that may never be something your child finds tolerable (and there are plenty of people in the world who would find large groups intolerable too). However, make sure the child asks the kid on a playdate and not the parent or guardian. Teaching kids to go out on the limb and taking risks is important to build confidence.

Pick an appropriate daycare.",How to Get Government Help With Paying for Daycare1," The Office of Childcare, a department and website run by the federal government, provides information for families about childcare. You can find information on how to choose good childcare and where to find funding on the ""Resources for Parents"" page., This page is called the CCDF Grantee State and Territory Contacts. It lists the contacts for each state and territory that provide funding for childcare., The list is alphabetical. Each state and territory has an address and a website. Click on the website for your state to find out more about funding where you live., Many states have a way for you to check your eligibility before you apply. That way, you won't waste time applying for assistance you can't receive. Most of the time, eligibility is based at least partially on income, so you will need to know how much you make in a year before checking your eligibility.Financial eligibility is usually set at a certain percentage of the federal poverty level. That means that the federal government draws a line at where it considers a person or a family to be in poverty, though it changes based on how many people are in your family. Services offered by states may be offered to those who are at or below 150 percent of the poverty level, for example, or 300 percent of the poverty level. It is generally up to the state.
As of 2015, the federal poverty level was set at $11,770 for a single person. If you have two people in your family, the line goes up to $15,930, while a family of three is set at $20,090. For four people, the line is $24,250, while five people is $28,410 and six is $32,570., Often, you will need to contact your local office to find out more about childcare. Your state website should have a list of local offices so you can find one in your area.For instance, in Texas, the Texas Workforce Commission is in charge of daycare funding, so you contact your local Texas Workforce Commission office., If you can't find the appropriate website for your state, you can try calling 2-1-1. This number is a general number for all kinds of support. In many states, that includes daycare help.However, not every state provides daycare help through this line, and some states, such as Connecticut, have a separate 211 number and site dedicated to childcare.Simply dial 211 on your phone. The call is free. Someone will help you find what you need. You can also find help online at 211.org., Most states have requirements for the daycare you choose if the state is providing funding. For instance, the daycare should be licensed with the state. Alternatively, the daycare may be registered with the state entity that provides funding, or it may be a run by the U.S. Military. Your funding entity will give you a list of requirements when you receive funding.An alternative is paying a relative to watch your child, although he or she generally must also be registered with the funding agency and he or she must be over 18 and not a spouse."

Expect your child to smile by three to five months old.,
Pay attention to the noises your child makes.,
Pay attention to your child’s ability to form words or sentences.,
Become familiar with the possible developmental delays.,
Understand the possible treatments.",How to Recognize Developmental Delays in Children1," If your child does not start to smile, known as social smiling, at you or other caregivers by three to five months of age, this may be a sign of a developmental delay., Meaningless words and sounds, such as babbling, are normally made by children at six months old and increases until the child reaches 9 to 12 months old.If your child does not make these noises or any noises at all, they may have a developmental delay.

, Your child’s first words will usually have single or reduplicated syllables, such as ""mama"", ""dada"", ""baba"", or ""papa"".By 12 months old, your child should also react to words like “no” and “bye bye” with eye contact and gestures.


Two-word combinations are usually formed by two years of age. Your child should be able to combine two words to communicate with you, such as ""mama play"", ""papa milk"", and ""ball gone"". They should also have a vocabulary of at least 20 words.
Three-word or larger sentences usually are created by the time they are four years old. Normally, a child at this age can form sentences to communicate with you and with other children, for example, “Mama play ball”, “Me go play doll” and “I want to eat apple.”, Speech delays are the most common type of developmental delay in children. There are several possible developmental delays associated with this area, including:


Learning disabilities.

Autism spectrum disorders, a group of neurological disabilities that involve impairment in communication and social interaction, and unusual thinking skills.
Hearing loss or impairment.
Problems with the muscles that controls speech, such as a deformed frenulum, lips or palate.

, Make sure you understand the options for treatment of this developmental delay, including:


Speech therapy.
Physical and occupational therapy for articulation difficulties.
Be patient and positive by encouraging your child to read regularly, engage in conversation, and ask them questions in clear, simple words.
Before proceeding with treatment, a hearing test should be done to rule out any hearing trouble, which may also need treatment.

Interact with your baby.,
Call your baby’s name.,
Play with your toddler.,
Examine differences of opinion.,
Assess moods and outbursts.",How to Recognize Signs of Autism in a Child1," A typical infant is a social creature by nature and loves to make eye contact. An autistic infant may appear like they are not interacting with parents, or may look ""inattentive"" to non-autistic parents.


Make eye contact. A typically developing baby can return eye contact by six to eight weeks of age. An autistic child may not look at you, or may avoid looking at your eyes.
Smile at your baby. A non-autistic baby can smile and offer warm and happy expressions by six weeks of age or earlier. An autistic baby may not smile, even to a parent.
Make faces at your baby. See if they mimic you. An autistic child may not participate in playing copycat.;
, A typical baby will respond to it by nine months of age.Typically developing babies will be able to call you Mama or Dada in return by 12 months of age.

, By ages two to three, a typical child will be very interested in playing games with you and others.


An autistic toddler may appear disconnected from the world, or deep in thought. A non-autistic toddler will be involving you in their world by pointing, showing, reaching, or waving by 12 months of age.
A typical child engages in parallel play until they are about three years old. When your toddler engages in parallel play, this means they play alongside other children and enjoy their company but do not necessarily engage in cooperative play.Don’t confuse parallel play with an autistic child not being socially engaged.

, By around age five, a typical child can understand that you have a different opinion about things. An autistic child tends to have great difficulty in understanding that others have different points of view, thoughts, and feelings than their own. They often appear to lack empathy for others.


If your child loves strawberry ice cream, tell your child that chocolate ice cream is your favourite, and see if they argue or get upset that you do not share the same opinion as them.
Many autistic people understand this better in theory than in praxis.An autistic girl might understand that you like the color blue, but have no idea that it would upset you if she wandered off to check out the balloons across the street.

, An autistic child may experience meltdowns, or outbursts of extreme emotion that often resemble a temper tantrum.However, these are not voluntary and are extremely upsetting to the child.


An autistic child experiences many challenges, and may attempt to ""bottle up"" emotions to please caregivers. Emotions may spiral out of control, and the child can become so frustrated that they engage in self-injury, such as banging their head against a wall or biting themselves.
Autistic children may experience more pain due to sensory issues, mistreatment, and other problems. They may lash out more often in self-defense.

Notice if your child rubs their eyes excessively or has watery eyes.,
Be aware of the possible developmental delays.,
Be aware of the possible treatments.",How to Recognize Developmental Delays in Children2," You child’s eyes are crossed at birth until two months old, when they typically stop crossing their eyes., By three months of age, typically developing children are able to follow moving objects and also the movement of your hands.They may also stare at moving objects. If your child is not acknowledging or focusing on moving objects, this may be a warning sign.

, Normally, children at four months of age and older will have less head movements when looking or gazing at moving objects.


If your child moves their head with their eyes when looking at objects to the side of them, this may indicate a problem with the eye muscles that control the lateral (side) movement of the eyes.

, At seven months of age, your child should be able to grab objects near them. If they cannot do this, they may have problems judging distance, or be nearsighted or farsighted.By age three, if your child continues to complain about having to narrow their eyes to see distant or near objects, or if this issue is noted by a teacher or caregiver, they may have visual developmental issues., Frequent rubbing of the eyes may be related to a blocked tear duct, causing the eyes to become irritated and watery.


If your child complains of eye pains or discomfort, they may be experiencing visual developmental issues.

, There are several possible causes of vision delays, including:


Issues of refraction, such as nearsightedness and farsightedness.
Amblyopia or lazy eye, which is poor vision in one eye that may appear to turn outward.
Blocked tear ducts, meaning tears cannot pass through the tear ducts because it is obstructed, causing your child’s eyes to become irritated and watery.
Strabismus or cross eyed, which means your child’s eyes turn in or out and up or down.
Infantile cataracts, which can be inherited and look like a cloudy appearance on the lens of your child’s eye(s).

While it is perfectly normal for your child to have a head lag at one month old, by four months, typically developing gain increased head control and be able to hold up their head properly.Poor head control or a head lag can indicate a condition called cerebral palsy.

, As early as six months, normal children can grab objects such as a toy or food and put it into their mouth using their hand. But if your child does not grab or grasp for objects and put them in their mouth, this indicates poor hand to mouth coordination.

, Normally, your child can roll over by six months old without any assistance.But if they cannot roll over in any direction, and they have difficulty sitting properly on their own, these may be warning signs.


As well, if your child has difficulty bearing weight on their legs when held up to stand or if they look clumsy and fall often, they may have developmental motor skill issues.

, By two years old, typical children are able to walk on their own and push or pull objects or toys. If they are unable to walk by 14 months, this may indicate problems with their motor skills.

, If your child shows delays in the development of small muscles skills like holding crayons or utensils with their hands, this may indicate larger developmental issues.


Any signs of regression of already learned motor skills, both small muscle and large muscle, such as holding objects, crawling, sitting, or walking, may indicate serious developmental issues, so always be cautious of this. There is a wide range of normal motor skills in children, but it is important to detect any delays early to intervene and improve your child’s motor skills.

, Possible causes of motor skill delays include:


Ataxia, a defect that impairs muscle coordination.

Cerebral palsy, a condition caused by damage to the brain before birth.
Myopathy, a disease involving a loss of muscle function.
Vision issues.
Spina bifida, a genetic condition that can cause partial or total paralysis of the lower body.

Autism.

, This may include occupational and physical therapy by specialists and at home with a caregiver or by you.


Children with mild motor skill delays will improve well with the help of therapy but children with disorders like cerebral palsy have a weak prognosis and may not be able to lead an independent life.

Notice if your child does not react to loud or sudden noises.,
Look for indications that your child has trouble speaking clearly.,
Notice if your child cannot identify people or objects by name.,
Take note of any complaints of earaches or ear issues.,
Be aware of the possible developmental delays.,
Be aware of the possible treatments.",How to Recognize Developmental Delays in Children4," Sirens outside, a loud bang in the kitchen, a dog barking, these are all sounds your child should be startled by and react to by turn their head towards the sound or gesturing to the source of the sound. By three months old, your child should also react to musical toys, rattles, or instruments and move their body to the sound of music.


Older children with hearing issues may constantly turn up the volume of the television, or want closed captions.

, By eight months old, typical children attempt to make sounds or imitate the words or sounds made by others around them. When you tell your child “no” or “yes”, or change the tone of your voice, they should visibly react to you.

, By around 12 to 14 months old, typical children react to their name being called and are able to follow common vocal instructions like “come here” or “go inside” or “bye bye”. By around three years old, they should be able to follow action words like run, walk, stop, and understand concepts like big, small, plural, opposite, etc.


They should also be comfortable expressing their desires by speaking and recognize the names of family members, familiar people, pets, and objects.
If your child does not enjoy reading or speaking, it may be because they are having difficulty comprehending words. They may not show curiosity about people or things or ask you questions about their environment if they are not aware of their surroundings., If your child has constant issues with earaches or noises in their ears, this may be an indication of auditory developmental issues., Several causes of auditory developmental delays include:


Genetic hearing loss or defect from birth.
Low birth weight.
Birth defects in the ear canal or middle ear.
Recurrent ear infections, resulting in fluid collection in the ear.
Injuries to the eardrum.

, Hearing is directly related to a baby’s ability to learn and understand, and a hearing defect or delay can result in a delay of other developmental milestones. So it is essential to screen your child for hearing issues and address them as soon as possible. An early diagnosis and early treatment will lead to a faster recovery and aid in developing better or normal hearing skills.


Your child’s doctor will use an otoscope to look inside your child’s ear canal. Older children will be tested by an audiometry.
Common tests are run on newborns to check for auditory issues, including auditory brain stem response and Otoacoustic emissions testing to detect hearing defects or loss.
Ear infections may be treated with medication or ear tubes. Surgery may be needed to correct any structural problems in your child’s ears.
Treatments to improve hearing skills include cochlear implants, speech therapy, and learning sign language."

Notice if your child has learning and attention issues in school.,
Be aware of the possible developmental delays.,
Be aware of the possible treatments.",How to Recognize Developmental Delays in Children5," Your child will normally start to smile at six to eight weeks old. If you do not notice they smiling at two months or older, they may have a form of cognitive development delay.


They should also react to the facial expressions of others and display facial expressions, even if it’s sadness or anger.

, As early as three to four months old, typical children show affection towards others through physical gestures like gurgling, babbling, smiling, and moving their arms and legs.By 12 months of age, they are able to interact with you through other physical gestures like waving their hands. , Typical children are able to express their feelings and emotions in stressful or harmful situations.


For example, if they fall and get hurt, they would cry or verbalize their injury, rather than stay quiet or appear emotionless. If they do not have these reactions, they may have damage to the part of the brain that controls emotion.
Exaggerated fear responses in ordinary situations or diminished response to strong stimuli may indicate Sensory Integration Disorder.

, One of the most common games that parents and newborns play is Peek a Boo. At 8 to 12 months old, a typical child will want to play games with you like Peek a Boo, and respond to you with laughing or babbling sounds.Typical children enjoy playing pretend with dolls or stuffed animals alone or with others, imitating father or mother roles and other familiar figures while playing.The willingness to play with other children is also very important, as a child’s natural instinct will be to see another child and play or talk to them even though they are new or unfamiliar. If your child does not enjoy playing with others, this may indicate your child has problems with communication and interaction.

, If your child has difficulty following instructions, it may be because they cannot understand or comprehend the instruction, indicating possible cognitive developmental issues.


As early as four months old, a typically developing child will repeat your words or imitate your actions, such as sticking your tongue out or blinking.If your child does not do this, it may be because they cannot recognize or understand your actions.

, As children with social and cognitive developmental delays grow older, they have difficulty with intellectual skills like a lack of reasoning skills, an inability to sit still in class, difficulty memorizing problems or questions, and a slow rate of learning.


They tend to perform poorly in academics compared to their peers and their learning abilities are usually two grades below others in their grade or age group., Social development delays include issues with interacting, sharing, and co-operating with others, as well as difficulties forming relationships.Cognitive development issues include issues with learning and functioning.These delays may be caused by:


Genetic disabilities like Down syndrome.
Significant medical problems before and during birth, or an exposure to toxins or alcohol (fetal alcohol syndrome).
Parental neglect or family disorder.

Autism spectrum disorders.

, If social and cognitive developmental delays are detected early in your child, proper treatment and assistance can improve their performance and help them become independent.


Occupational, social, and cognitive skill-oriented therapies are all effective ways to treat social and cognitive issues.
Medication may be required to control problematic behavior.
Behavioral therapy may be needed in severe cases.

Coo to your baby and see if they coo back.,
Have a conversation.,
Try some expressions.,
Check their facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language.",How to Recognize Signs of Autism in a Child2," Listen for increasing sounds and babbling as they grow. Children usually become fully verbal by 16 to 24 months of age.


A typical baby will be able to share sounds back-and-forth with you like sharing a conversation by nine months of age. An autistic baby may not be verbal at all or may have been verbal but then lost the skill.
A typical child will be babbling by about 12 months of age.

, Talk together about your child’s favourite toy and listen to their sentence structure and conversation skills. Typically developing children will have many words by 16 months of age, can create their own meaningful, two-word phrases by 24 months of age, and have coherent sentences by age five.


An autistic child tends to misplace words in sentence structure or simply repeat others’ phrases or sentences, called parroting or echolalia.They might mix up pronouns, saying ""Do you want pancakes?"" when they are trying to say that they want pancakes.Some autistic children pass over the “kid-speak” phase and have superior language skills. They may learn to speak early, and/or grow large vocabularies. They may converse differently than their peers do.

, Determine if your child takes phrases literally. An autistic child tends to misinterpret body language, tone of voice, and expressions.


If you have a moment of sarcastic frustration and claim, “How wonderful!” when you find your autistic child has used his red marker all over the living room walls, they may think you literally mean their art is wonderful.

, Autistic children often have unique nonverbal communication. Because most people are used to watching non-autistic body language, this may be confusing to you and others at times.


Robotic, singsong, or unusually childish tone of voice (even into teen or adult years)
Body language that does not seem to match their mood
Little variation in facial expressions, exaggerated facial expressions, or otherwise unique expressions

"
"
Watch your child for unusual repetition of behaviours.,
Notice how your child plays.,
Recognize special interests and favorite objects.,
Notice a need for routine.,
Look for heightened and diminished sensitivity to sensations.",How to Recognize Signs of Autism in a Child3," While all kids enjoy repetitive play to some degree, autistic children will exhibit strong repetitive behaviours such as rocking, hand-flapping, rearranging objects, or repeating sounds over and over again, called echolalia.These can be essential for self-calming and relaxation.


All children partake in some verbal mimicry until the age of three. An autistic child may do this more often, and beyond the age of threeSome repetitive behaviours are called self-stimulation or ""stimming,"" meaning that they stimulate the child’s senses. An example of this is if your son wiggles his fingers in front of his eyes to stimulate his vision and amuse himself.

, Autistic children may not engage in visible imaginative play, preferring to organize objects (e.g. organizing toys or building a city for their dolls instead of playing house). The imagination is occurring inside their head.


Try breaking the pattern: rearranging the dolls they are lining up or passing in front of them while they are trying to walk in a circle. An autistic child will be noticeably bothered by you interfering.
Autistic children may be able to engage in imaginative play with another child, especially if that child takes the lead; however, these children will usually not do it on their own.

, Intense and unusual obsessions with everyday household objects (such as a broom or string) or, later, facts, may be a sign of autism.An autistic child may develop a special interest about a topic, and gain an extraordinary depth of knowledge. Examples include cats, baseball statistics, The Wizard of Oz, logic puzzles, and checkers. A child may ""light up"" or open up when asked about these subjects.
A child may have one special interest at a time, or a few. They can change as the child learns and grows.

, Many autistic children have a strong need for routines and consistency, and may show exaggerated reactions or protests to changes in routines. For instance, if you always walk with your child to school taking the same route, try changing it up. An autistic child may become very resistant and upset by this change of routine.


Routines may have to do with the order of daily tasks, but they may also be verbal (such as asking the same questions repeatedly), have to do with food (only eating foods of a certain color), clothing (only wearing clothes of a specific fabric or color), the location of furniture, and so on.Routines can be very comforting for a person with autism. The world can seem unpredictable, confusing, and scary to this person, and a routine can give them some sense of control and stability.

, If your child shows unusual discomfort to light, textures, sounds, tastes, or temperatures, talk to your doctor.Autistic children may ""overreact"" to new sounds (e.g. a sudden loud noise or a vacuum cleaner), textures (e.g. an itchy sweater or sock), et cetera. This is because the particular sense is magnified, so it causes real discomfort or pain.

"
"
Know when autism may be noticed.,
Know your childhood milestones.,
Watch for loss of skills.",How to Recognize Signs of Autism in a Child4," Some symptoms are clear around two to three years of age. Beyond that, a child may be diagnosed at any age, especially during a transition (e.g. going to high school or moving house) or other stressful periods. Excessive life demands may cause an autistic person to ""regress"" in order to cope,causing concerned loved ones to seek a diagnosis.


In some children, signs may be noticed in the first one to two years of life.
Some are not diagnosed until college, when their developmental differences become especially obvious.

, With some variation, most children meet developmental milestones following a specific pattern. Autistic children may meet these milestones later.Some may be precocious, and their parents may consider them a struggling or introverted gifted child.


By age three, children are often able to walk stairs, work with simple dexterity toys, and play make-believe.
By age four, a child can retell their favourite stories, scribble, and follow simple directions.
By age five, a child can generally draw pictures, talk about their day, wash their hands, and focus on a task.
Older autistic children and teens may exhibit strict adherence to patterns and rituals, engage passionately in special interests, enjoy things that are not typical of their age group,avoid eye contact, and be highly sensitive to touch.

, Speak to your family doctor if you have concerns at any point in your child’s development. Do not delay if your child experiences a loss of speech, self-care skills, or social skills at any age.


Most skills that are lost are still ""there"" and can be regained.

Think about your family’s genetics.,
Look for issues in your child’s environment.,
Test your child for developmental delays.",How to Recognize Developmental Delays in Children6," Children born with a chromosomal or genetic anomaly are at a greater risk for developmental delays. These anomalies are common in children with Down syndrome, as the child has an extra genetic material that alters the course of their development, resulting in a developmental delay., Factors such as exposure to toxic agents like lead and drugs before or after birth, as well as poor maternal nutrition, transmitted infections like measles or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from mother to child during pregnancy, premature birth and a lack of maternal care can all put a child at a higher risk for developmental delays.


As the number of risk factors increase for a child, this will make them more susceptible to developmental delays. The risk factors have a cumulative effect on the child.

, As these developmental issues can lead to serious health issues for your child, it’s a good idea to test them from an early age to prevent any smaller delays from becoming bigger, life changing issues.


Screening is a broad and fast measurement of a child’s skills, and is a good preliminary step to determine if your child requires a more in depth evaluation. Developmental screening can be performed through a questionnaire given to the child’s parents or guardians, or as a test given to the child by a trained health professional.
A developmental evaluation is a more extensive and thorough assessment of your child’s skills and is only performed by an experienced health professional, such as a psychologist. This test will outline your child’s strengths and weaknesses in all five developmental areas. The outcome of this evaluation will indicate if your child needs immediate medical assistance or treatment.

Talk to your child about sleeping alone.,
Answer any questions your child might have.,
Make a pre-bedtime routine for your child.,

Stick to your plan and see it through without exception.,
Check in on your child every once in a while.,
Bring your child back to bed if he or she gets out.",How to Get a Toddler to Sleep Alone," Instead of making the switch suddenly, it is important to prepare the toddler well in advance. This can be done by talking to the toddler about changing where they will be sleeping.


These conversations should be very positive and focus on the good aspects of the change, such as how the child is growing up. The parent should not mention anything about how much they will miss having their child in the room with them at night because that will only confuse their child.
Highlight the benefits of independent sleep. Point out that the child is big and so grown up, promise him that he will have more space and better dreams, or promise a reward in the morning if he makes it through the night.;
, There are always “what-ifs” that need to be dealt with when a toddler is first learning to go to sleep alone. They will ask many questions and it is important that the parents treat these questions seriously and try to give answers that will comfort the child.


Sleeping alone is a very big step for toddlers and they want to understand everything about how things are going to be different.
One thing to make clear is that the toddler is allowed to get up to use the toilet if they are not in diapers. However, they need to be aware that it is not play time or time to visit the parents.

, Most pediatricians recommend that children be started on a routine as soon as possible so that they, and their parents, know what to expect next. If a good bedtime routine is not in place, the parents should take the time necessary to set one up and get the child used to it before trying to get the toddler to sleep alone.


Most bedtime routines are more about a sequence of events than they are about having things occur at a set time. Along with getting dressed for bed, the toddler’s bedtime routine should include things like brushing teeth, diaper change or using the toilet, getting a small sip of water, and a calm bedtime story.
Many toddlers will try to delay bedtime by continually requesting to do these things more than once, but the parent needs to stay firm about limits that are set. elevision, especially very active shows, as well as loud or high-paced music, should be avoided because they are not very soothing or calming.

, Making the toddler’s new sleeping space more personally theirs is another way to get them to be more enthusiastic about sleeping in a different room than the one that they have been sharing with their parents from the beginning.


Since the toddler is likely to also be changing to a regular bed instead of the crib, it is a good idea to take them shopping to pick out the sheets and blankets for their new bed. Giving the toddler this responsibility will help them feel more grownup, independent, and ready to sleep alone.
If the toddler will not be sharing the bedroom with any siblings, they can also help pick out some of the furniture or other décor that will be used in their new room.
Do not put a television, a computer or other appealing games in the child's room. The environment should be as peaceful and free from distractions as possible.

, One of the main issues that toddlers have with sleeping alone is that they worry about no longer having their parents readily available, which leaves them feeling quite vulnerable. Sounds that they ignored while they were in the bedroom with their parents will suddenly seem ten times scarier and the toddler might even think there are monsters in their new room.


It is important that the parents do not simply tell the toddler that monsters do not exist, because they are very real to the child. Instead, the parents should have an open discussion with the toddler about where they think the monsters are hiding and then proceed to search those places to show the toddler that no monsters are hiding in the room.
Another way that parents can help their toddler deal with the issue of possible monsters is to tell their toddler that they will spray the bedroom with “Monster-Be-Gone” spray. This can be something as simple as a misting bottle of water as long as the toddler is unaware that it is not real.

, Some parents find it helpful to allow the toddler to have a small night light on when they first start to sleep alone. However, the night light should be put in a place where it does not shine directly on the toddler’s pillow. It also should be checked that the night light is not creating spooky shadows instead of chasing them away.


Some parents decide against a night light and give their toddler a small flashlight to keep under their pillow and use only when needed.

, If your child refuses to sleep alone because it requires your attention, give him enough attention during the day. Spend with him at least 20 minutes a day in a play, away from the TV or computer. This way toddler will separate from you more easily and agree to sleep alone.

, Kiss him good night, encourage him to sleep alone and let him sleep. Explain to your child that for nice and peaceful sleep it is important to think about something nice. Give him a task to close his eyes and think about a nice event. Thinking will get him tired and he will fall asleep.

, Let him to know that you're around and you can come whenever he needs. Promise you'll come back to check out his new room and make sure everything is okay.


Identify a specific time when you will be back to check if he is sleeping and if everything is OK. Make a promise just so he can sleep easier.

, In this way, you'll make it clear that you are there and you'll be back. Start with returning after 5-10 minutes and then gradually lengthen the time between returns.


If you return too soon, in less than 5 or 10 minutes, the child will likely still be awake. If you wait too long, it will be frightened and nervous. The period of 5-10 minutes is best to begin with. You put your child know that you are there and it will eventually be soothed by the fact and then be able to fall asleep.

, If your child does not easily accept that he must remain in the room, stay with him, but do not sleep with him or talk to him.


Sit a little away from him and read a book or do something, but do not pay attention to the child. He should be trying to sleep and nothing else.
Gradually move away more and more. Every day sit further continuing with your activities .
When you really mean that the child is ready, try not to stay in the room, but let him know that you are present and you can check it out and leave the room.

, Not all children respond calmly when left alone in the room. If your child starts to cry, proceed with your decision and return only after five minutes. Let him know that you are there, encourage him to sleep alone again and leave the room. Continue until the child calms down and falls asleep

, In the morning when you wake up, praise the child because he slept alone and reward him with a little thing, like going to the park. This will encourage him to continue to behave in this way.


If the toddler has trouble sleeping alone throughout the entire night, they can still be rewarded for their attempts. This will encourage them to keep trying. The parents can set up a sticker chart that allows the toddler a minor reward after a certain number of stickers are collected. Of course, the ultimate goal of eventually sleeping alone should be on the chart as well.

, Although the child insists that he cannot sleep alone, be persistent and praise him if he stays in his bed, and then get out again.


Do not let the child go back to your room, even when hr is particularly nervous or even when he is sick. If you want to succeed, follow the rules without exceptions.

, In the beginning check the child at night for a while, to let him know that you are there for him at night.

, During the night if he leaves his room, bring him back to bed. Explain that he is big, has his own bedroom and needs to sleep in his own bed. Repeat as many times as necessary. Your toddler will eventually learn and accept.

Decide on an appropriate curfew.,
Tell your child about the curfew.,
Make the consequences clear to your child.,
Help your child get to bed on time.",How to Establish a Curfew with Your Child1," This should take into account when your child gets sleepy, age, and how long they typically nap during the day. Younger children need more sleep than older children or adults, but each child will vary in how much sleep is needed and you need to take this into account when making your decision.


This step should not involve your child.;
, Explain what he/she will have to do prior to that time––for example, get undressed; take a bath; brush teeth. Explain that if he/she is not ready to be in bed at the appointed time, there will be consequences.

, Some examples could be:


You will have to go to bed 15 minutes earlier tomorrow.
You will not get dessert tomorrow.
You will not be able to watch television tomorrow.
You could also explain ""conditional consequences"" such as, if you were late because you were playing with Thomas the Tank Engine, you won't be able to play with Thomas the Tank Engine during the hour before you are supposed to be in bed.

, At this age, children likely won't be able to bathe themselves or brush their own teeth without supervision. Just gently suggest that they should go take a bath, and remind them of the curfew.


Make sure that you or another responsible person are always available to supervise the child's pre-bed activities. If this part slips, the child will not take the curfew seriously because it will seem you're not doing so either.

,
Search online for child care providers.,
Build a list based on recommendations and online searches.

,

Decide which centers you would like to visit and make appointments to tour the facilities.

,
On your tour, meet the child care providers for your child's age group, and if possible, observe the children interacting with each other and with the providers.,
Decide which provider or providers seem to be the best fit for your child, and make a surprise visit.,
Select one provider that you believe is the best fit, and make one more visit with your child this time.,
Once your child is officially enrolled, maintain close relationships with the staff.",How to Find Excellent Day Care," Many child care centers have long waiting lists, so it is never too early to start looking. If you are pregnant, start looking for child care for after your baby is born.;
, Often there is a waiting period for these funds, and they are only accepted by certain child care providers. You can find information about child care subsidies at the Administration for Children and Families website at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ccb/parents/index.htm.

, How many children need care? How old are they? What hours do you need care? Where should the child care provider be located? When does your child need to start?

, What are the most important features of a child care provider? Does your child have special needs, like nutritional concerns or disabilities? Do you want a child care provider that implements an educational curriculum? Do you prefer a larger playground? Do you prefer mixed-age classes or same-age classes? Do you prefer a center that provides meals or do you want to provide all of your child's food? Is it important for a center to be close to your home or work?

,,, Most states have searchable lists of providers that give information such as hours of operation, age of children accepted, total number of children allowed in the center, and whether they accept state child care subsidies.

,, Take good notes while you are on the phone so that you can keep the information straight.

,, Bring a list of questions to ask the staff members.

, You should check in with a staff member as soon as you arrive and try not to disturb the children or caregivers. Good providers have an open door policy for parents that allows you to observe caregivers without making an appointment or calling ahead.

, If possible, make arrangements for you child to play with the other children or sit in on a lesson.

, Try to make extra time when you drop-off and pick-up your child to chat with the caregivers and observe your child's interaction with them and the other children.

Decide on an appropriate curfew.,
Tell your child about the curfew.,
Explain what the consequences will be.,
Explain what he/she will need to do in order to get an extension of a curfew.,
Help your child get to bed by the appointed time.",How to Establish a Curfew with Your Child2," This should take into account when your child gets tired, age, and what time they wake up in the morning.


Depending on the maturity level of your child, you may want to involve him/her in making this decision. Remember that a child is more likely to respect a decision in which he or she has taken a part.

, Explain what he/she will have to do prior to that time––for example, get undressed; finish homework; brush teeth. Explain that if he/she is not ready to be in bed at the appointed time, there will be consequences.


Alternatively, for older teenagers, you may want to make curfew the time they must be home by. If you choose to do that, you may want to also make a time by which they must be in bed, or at which they must be quiet and respect the other householders' need for sleep/quiet time.

, You may wish to say that you will decide on appropriate consequences when the time comes. However, having consequences clearly spelled out in advance creates a sense of consistency and fairness, rather than giving out arbitrary consequences that the child may feel are out of proportion to the broken curfew instance.

, As the child gets older, it is reasonable to expect that not every night will be the same bedtime. Extensions might be given in such circumstances as:


When asked for, a day or two in advance, for a specific reason.
By calling and explaining why you will be late.
For a permanent extension, they should prove that they are not tired during the day, and have no problem getting up. By this stage, it is best to shift responsibility for meeting deadlines, getting somewhere on time, etc., onto the child.

, Younger children may need a reminder about the time, especially in the beginning. However, even older children can do with being reminded of the time, especially when deeply involved in something they're enjoying.


Sometimes, you may wish to go to bed before an older teenage child. In this case, ask them to turn off the lights and be certain the doors, etc., are all locked. Inform them that you're going to bed for the night and that you expect them to be in bed by their curfew.

Look for crying.,
Listen for babbling.Babbling is a common sign of normal speech development in babies.,
Look for a lack of gestures.",How to Recognize Signs of Speech Delay1," When your child is born, you should hear them crying. They will cry often during their early months of life, especially at night, when they might wake at odd hours in order to cry. After two to three months, the baby will cry in response to irritation and discomfort. When they see you (their parent), however, they will coo.If your baby doesn’t cry regularly in their earliest months of life, they might have a speech delay.;
, During their first year, your baby will move from random babbling to more structured babbling. For instance, when the baby is 3-4 months old, they will babble randomly. At 5-6 months old, they will babble more rhythmically, perhaps in short sentence-like bursts. After your baby is 6-11 months old, they will babble even more closely in imitation of speech and use facial expressions to emphasize what they are babbling about., Children with normal speech development can use a larger number of hand gestures than children with speech delays, who use relatively few hand gestures.For instance, at age one or two, your child should be able to wave goodbye, point at things they want, and point in order to draw attention to things."
"
Look for a growing vocabulary.,
Look for an understanding of multiple meanings.,
Look for storytelling.,
Listen for growing grammatical complexity.,
Look for language that indicates self-awareness.,
Look for the ability to understand physical space.",How to Recognize Signs of Speech Delay2," After your baby is one year old, they will probably be able to say one or two words. After your child is 18 months old, they will have a vocabulary of 5-20 words and will be able to say some names. When your baby is between one and two years old, they will understand and use words like “more” and “no.” When your child is two to three years old, they will have a 450-word vocabulary. From this point on, your child’s vocabulary will grow by about 500 words each year.In other words, when they reach three to four years of age, they will have about 1,000 words at their disposal.
At four to five years of age, they will have around 1,500 words under their belt.
And between five and six years of age, your child will command 2,000 words.

, As your child ages, they should begin using the same word in different ways. For instance, one month, the child may mean, “Give me the bottle” when they say “Bottle.” The next month, they might mean, “There is a bottle” when they say “Bottle.”Pay attention to how your child uses words to determine if they are using words in a rigid way, which could be a sign of speech delay.

, When your child is between three and four years old they will be able to tell a story. If your child cannot tell a story with a (relatively) logical beginning, middle, and end at this age, they may have a speech delay., Your child’s grammatical abilities should continue to become more developed as they age. For instance, at between two and three years of age, your child should be able to combine nouns and verbs in simple sentences. They should also be able to form some plurals. Between four and five years of age, your child should be able to use the appropriate past tense form of many words.If your child’s grammatical abilities do not advance, they likely have a speech delay.

, At some point, your child should be able to conceptualize and express information about themselves and their feelings. For instance, when your child is 12-18 months old, they’ll begin to recognize their own body parts and point to them when directed to do so. They’ll also be able to understand notions of property and might go through a phase in which they refer to everything as “mine.”Between two and three years of age, your child should be able to refer to themselves as “me.” When your child is about three or four years old, they should be able to identify their full name The inability to be able to use self-aware language indicates that your child may have a speech delay.

, Eventually, your child should begin to understand and express information about where they are and the differences between objects and places of different sizes. For instance, between two and three years old, your child will be able to differentiate between “big” and “little.” Between three and four, they’ll be able to recognize the name of the street they live on. Between four and five years of age, your child will be able to use color and shape to describe things. Finally, between five and six years old, your child will be able to recite their full address, differentiate between left and right, and describe things as “near” or “far.”"

Take your child to the doctor.,
Don’t worry too much.,
Listen and respond to your child.At every stage of early life, it is important to listen to all speech and precursors of speech that your child produces.,
Read to your child.,
Narrate life for your child.,
Encourage play.,
Use a variety of words.,
Teach your child a second language.,
Enroll your child in speech-language therapy if they have a speech delay.",How to Recognize Signs of Speech Delay3," If your child does not meet an important milestone in speech development, take them to the doctor and have their hearing checked. Poor hearing often leads to poor speech development because the child is not able to hear and then reproduce normal speech. No matter the cause of the speech delay, your child’s doctor will be able to recommend next steps.The older your child is when they are diagnosed as having a speech delay, the less likely they are to catch up to their peers’ level of speech capabilities., If your child seems to not be as far along in their use of speech as another child, that’s okay. They will probably catch up. The child you’re comparing your own child to might be advanced in their own capabilities and learning. The rate at which your own child learns and uses speech depend on a number of factors, including:how much speech the child hears
what type of speech the child hears
what sort of reception the child gets when they attempt speech

, For instance, if your child is babbling and you don’t say something in “reply,” your child might decide to stop practicing their primitive attempts at communication. This could lead to speech delays later., Even before your child is old enough to understand or appreciate a story, you should read to them. As you read along, you might show them pictures in the book you’re reading. Make a point of reading to your child every night.By two or three years old, your child will like to hear the same story over and over., Talk to your child about what they are doing and what you’re doing. For instance, if your child is petting the dog, you might say, “Wow, I see you’re petting the dog. That’s very nice of you.” Talk to your child about past, present, and future events. For instance, say, “Tomorrow, we’ll go to the park. Won’t that be fun?”, Play with your child so you can use words that describe the imaginative actions that your child engages in. For instance, you might say, “Wow, are you building a castle? Is there a princess in the castle?” Arrange for your child to play with other children of the same or similar age so they can practice conversing together., Increase the number and variety of words that you use in conversation with your child as they grow older. Start using longer, more complex sentences as your child begins to understand more words in order to help them build their language skills., If you are bilingual, you should feel free to use both your native and your second language around the house. A second language will give them the opportunity to test and play with the two different grammars and vocabulary sets. This keeps the gears of their brain’s language center tuning.Don’t worry about confusing your child – growing up with two languages will be natural for them and they’ll be able to understand how the languages are different from one another as they grow older.

, Speech-language therapy is a therapeutic intervention in which your child spends regularly scheduled time with a speech therapist. The speech therapist will help your child develop their lagging language skills.Your child’s doctor will be able to recommend a speech-language therapist.
The speech-language therapist will likely provide you with training to help your child develop their speech skills at home.
Your child will benefit most from speech-language therapy that lasts longer than eight weeks.

There is probably one centralized office in your state’s capitol and then local field offices around the state. You can find your local office by checking your state’s Attorney General’s website, which might have a map of field offices.
Alternately, you could stop into the court and ask where the nearest child support office is located.;
, You should contact the local child support division and tell them that you want to apply for child support services. They will help the parent with custody (the “custodial parent”) get child support from the parent who does not have custody (called the “non-custodial parent”).The child support division should send you an application to fill out.


You may also schedule an appointment to come in and meet with a representative who can answer your questions.

, In some states, the child’s grandparents will be responsible for child support obligations if the custodial parent is receiving government assistance. About a dozen states have passed these laws.You should ask the child support division if there is a law to this effect in your state.


In some states, the court will even consider the grandparents’ financial resources when setting the child support amount. This is beneficial for the custodial parent, since the grandparents undoubtedly make more than the minor parent.

, In civil disputes like child support matters, the law does not recognize minors as adults capable of representing themselves. Accordingly, minor parents will need to provide contact information for their parents or legal guardians, who serve as the minor’s adult representative.If parents or legal guardians cannot serve, then the minor can select another trusted adult as their “next friend.” The judge must determine if this person can serve as the legal representative.

, You may have to provide supporting documents along with your application. The child support division should tell you what you need to provide. For example, you may need to supply the following:children’s birth certificates
an acknowledgement of paternity, if the father signed one after the birth
documents that show your financial condition

, Make a copy of the entire application once you have completed it and gathered all necessary documents. You should then submit it to the address provided. You may have to pay a fee, depending on your circumstances.


If you are receiving public assistance, then you will not need to pay a fee.
However, if you aren’t on public assistance, then your fee will probably be limited to $25 for each year that you receive at least $500 in child support payments., The purpose of a negotiation conference is to allow the parents to reach an agreement without the need of going into court. The conference will probably be held at your local child support office. Depending on your office, the meeting either will be automatically scheduled or you will have to call and schedule it., Each minor can have an adult representative with them, whether their parents, guardian, or an adult friend.At the meeting, the parties will try to negotiate a child support order.

, If you can reach an agreement, then the child support division should write up an agreement to be signed. They will then present it to the judge for approval. You should keep a copy of the agreement for your records.

, If one of the minor parents won’t agree to child support, then the child support division will need to get a judge to award child support. The agency will draft a petition and file it in court.If the father is denying paternity, then the agency can ask the court to determine paternity first.


The minor parent requesting child support doesn’t have to work through the child support division.Instead, they could file for child support on their own. However, there is no real reason not to use the agency.
If you try to file for child support on your own, then you will probably need the help of a lawyer.

, The minor parent who is objecting to child support must be given notice that you have filed a petition for child support. Generally, you can arrange to have a copy of the petition hand delivered on the other parent.


Generally, the sheriff or constable will hand deliver the petition on the other parent. You can ask the court clerk how to schedule delivery. If the child support division is filing your petition, then they will handle serving notice on the other parent.

, The other parent might write a response objecting to the child support. For example, a father might deny his paternity. Having no current income, however, is not a reason to object to child support.


The response will be sent to you or the child support division.

, The judge won’t award child support until you attend a hearing. Make sure to note the deadline. In some states, such as Oregon, child support hearings are held over the phone. During the hearing, the representative from the child support division will argue to the judge why child support is warranted. As the minor parent, you may have to testify. Remember the following tips:Testify only when it is your turn. Don’t interrupt anyone.
Never guess. Instead, testify as to what you know. If you don’t know the answer to something, say “I don’t know.”
Avoid arguments and always remain calm. You will appear more believable if you remain professional.

, After all evidence has been submitted, the judge will decide whether child support is warranted. The judge will then sign an order.The order should state the amount of child support and how often the non-custodial parent should pay.


If the father denies paternity, then the judge probably won’t decide child support until receiving the results of a DNA test. This means you will probably have to attend two hearings—the first to decide whether a DNA test is necessary, and the second to find out the results and order child support.

, There are many federal, state, and local welfare programs potentially available to minor parents. To fully understand what is available, you should find your state’s Department of Human Services website, which should have contact information.


In many situations, a minor mother will automatically be referred to her state’s office after giving birth.The state may then assign her a caseworker who can help her find financial assistance.

, Each state offers minor parents different resources, so it is best to check with your caseworker or state’s Department of Human Services. Generally, the following support programs are available in many places:child care subsidies
food stamps
cash assistance programs
child health care

, The federal government has tightened eligibility requirements for receiving cash assistance, such as TANF. To qualify, a minor parent must meet the following:be enrolled in high school or a state-approved GED program
live under adult supervision
receive an exemption from the requirement to live under adult supervision, if you have no living parent or guardian or if you left the home for certain reasons, such as sexual abuse

Think about next steps.",How to Gain Child Custody As a Non‐Biological Parent," Although difficult, you can get child custody in a few situations. For example, the following are the most common:


Step-parent adoption.Because the child is already living with you, you might want to become the parent. Generally, you will need the biological parent to agree to terminate their parental rights. However, you can also get custody if you can show that the parent has abandoned their child.
Foster parent adoption. If you have been taking care of the child for a long time, you can often adopt if the biological parents have had their parental rights terminated.
Consent. Biological parents can voluntarily ask the court to terminate their parental rights. This will allow you to adopt.
Consent guardianship. With a guardianship, the parents do not lose their parental rights. However, you gain custody and the right to make legal decisions for the child, such as medical care and where they go to school. A parent can take back their consent to a guardianship at any time and get back custody of the children.Unfitness or incapacity. If the parents won’t consent to an adoption, then you might be able to show that they are unfit or otherwise unable to parent their child. This is extremely difficult and usually only happens if the parents have abused or abandoned the child, or if the parents are in prison.;
, The process is much easier if you can get the biological parents to consent to adoption or guardianship. You will need both to agree. It isn’t enough for only one parent to agree., If you want to try and prove the parents are unfit, then you should objectively analyze their parenting skills. Each state defines “unfit” in different ways. However, there are some common examples:The parent has abused the child, whether physically, emotionally, or sexually.
The parent has abandoned the child. In other words, the parent can’t be found.
The parent neglects the child. Neglect can be a bit of a gray area. Judges generally prefer that children stay with their parents, so you will need a lot of evidence of neglect, such as unmet medical needs, malnutrition, isolation, etc.

, You also will need to show to a court that you have a long-term relationship with the child. You should be able to point out that you are fully capable of providing for the child, just as a parent would.Your own relationship with the child works in tandem with the biological parents’ unfitness. If the parents have a history of not being able to take care of the child, then you can argue that it is in the child’s best interests to live with you since you have already been taking care of the child.
For example, you might be the child’s aunt who is taking care of the child because the father has abandoned the family and the mother has a drug addiction. In this case, you can argue that both parents are unfit and that you have been acting as a parent for the child.

, A qualified attorney can help you analyze your situation and determine whether you can seek child custody. Because the process is so complicated, you should also consider hiring the person to represent you. In particular, you should have a lawyer represent you if one or more of the biological parents is contesting custody.


You can get a referral to a family law attorney by contacting your local or state bar association. When you have a name, call up the lawyer and schedule a consultation.
See Choose a Family Law Attorney for more information.

, Each state has different laws, and some states limit your ability to even file for custody as a non-biological parent. At the consultation, you should ask the lawyer whether your state law allows you to file.


For example, in Michigan, a non-parent can’t file for custody if the child’s parents are or have been married.By contrast, other states are less restrictive. For example, in Arizona, you can apply for custody if the parents do not have physical custody.

, The paperwork you fill out will differ depending on whether you are seeking to adopt or whether you are trying to get guardianship. Nevertheless, your court should probably have forms you can pick up from the court clerk. Go to the county where the child lives and ask.Each court has different forms. However, you will generally need a “petition” for either an adoption or guardianship.If you hired a lawyer, then they should be able to create the necessary paperwork. This is one of the advantages of hiring a lawyer.

, Once you have completed the forms, you will need to file them with the court clerk. Make multiple copies since you might need to file a copy with the clerk. You also need a copy for your records and copies to serve on the parents.


You may have to pay a filing fee. You should check with the court clerk for the amount.

, The parents need to know that you are seeking custody of the child. You can give them notice by sending them a copy of the forms you filed. You should also send a “summons,” which you can get from the court clerk.


Parents can always waive service. If they agree to the adoption or guardianship, then they might happily do so. Usually, there is a form they can fill out.Otherwise, you can arrange that service be made by the sheriff or by anyone 18 or older who isn’t part of the case.

, The parents might respond in writing to your petition, especially when they want to fight your custody. They might file a response with the court and send you a copy. If you have a lawyer, then your lawyer will get the copy.

, Depending on your state, you may have to undergo a home study conducted by a licensed social worker. The purpose of the home study is to assess you and your surroundings.You can prepare for the home study by doing the following:


Identify why you want custody of the child. The social worker will want to understand your reasons for seeking custody.Get comfortable talking about the challenges of living with the child. The child probably already lives with you. You should be able to speak honestly. Don’t paint a picture that is too rosy.
Write down your daily routine. The social worker wants to understand your day-to-day life.Address any hazards in your home. You want the home to be physically safe, without obvious hazards, such as exposed wires or medications within the reach of children.

, Where the parents agree to the adoption or guardianship, then your hearing may be relatively simple. The judge will probably question the biological parents to make sure they understand what they are doing. You might not have to do more than talk about your relationship with the child.


However, where the biological parents are fighting you, then the hearing will be contested. At a contested hearing, each side can present evidence by calling witnesses and submitting documents.
You should talk with your lawyer about what evidence you want to submit. For example, you will probably need to show parental unfitness and your own strong relationship to the child. You might want witnesses who have seen the child with you and with the biological parents.
You can also request documents in a process called “discovery.”For example, you might want to subpoena medical records on the child or have the biological parents answer questions under oath. Discovery is a good way to uncover helpful evidence to use at your hearing.

, You can make a big impression based on your appearance. You should dress neatly in clean, well-pressed clothes.You don’t have to dress up in a suit if that makes you uncomfortable. However, you want to look like you are a responsible person.


If the child attends the hearing, then make sure that he or she also looks well taken care of. Cut their hair, trim their nails, and dress them in clean, well-fitting clothes. This will show the judge that you can act as a responsible parent.
See Dress for a Court Hearing for helpful tips.

, As the party seeking custody, you will probably present evidence first. You can have witnesses testify and introduce documents into evidence. You also need to show the judge your current relationship with the child, which means you will probably testify.


When testifying, remember to sit up straight and look the lawyer in the eye. When you answer, turn to the judge.
Speak loudly and clearly. If you feel nervous, take a couple deep breaths.
Always listen to the question and ask for clarification if you don’t understand it.The parents’ lawyer will be able to cross-examine you. Avoid arguing or being sarcastic. Also pause before answering to give your lawyer a chance to object.

, Any biological parent fighting custody can present witnesses as well. They may also testify. Your lawyer will have a chance to cross-examine each witness.

, At the end of the hearing, the judge will decide whether to award you custody. The judge will sign an order, which you or your lawyer may need to fill out. Make sure to keep a copy of the order.


Even if you are unhappy with the judge’s decision, you should remain respectful.You might end up seeing the judge again in the future.

, If you lose, you might want to appeal to a higher court. Talk about this possibility with your lawyer. In an appeal, you ask a higher court to review the trial court’s transcripts and set aside the order if the judge made a serious error. Don’t delay, since you generally don’t get much time to file a Notice of Appeal (often 30 days or less).Also discuss whether the child can still live with you. The biological parents might have fought your attempt to get custody, but they might not be able to get their lives turned around so that they can take care of the child.

Apply for assistance.",How to Find Child Care Outside Normal Work Hours1," In most U.S. states, there are government programs designed to subsidize those in need of child care. These range from free programs for low-income families to subsidized care for those in need. Unfortunately, many of these programs fail to cover the needs of those who work nonstandard hours. However, there are efforts to create programs for those who work nonstandard hours.If your state has a program, it will likely be through your Department of Education or Department of Human Services.
If you are unable to find a program, a social worker may be able to help you out.;
, Once you have identified the right government body, you should get in contact with them. You can email, call, or make a visit to their local office. The agency will likely take down your personal information and ask you to complete an application.

You might say something like “Do you have programs for people who work nonstandard hours?” or “What about child care if I work at night?”

, In order to receive any government assistance, you will need to complete some paperwork. This will likely include things like your current contact information, income, and information about your children.

Leave the kids with your partner.,
Talk to your relatives.,
Ask your friends or neighbors.",How to Find Child Care Outside Normal Work Hours2," If your partner is available, you can ask them to provide child care while you are at work. Try to coordinate with your partner’s work schedule so that one of you will be home with the children. If you are separated, see if your ex would be willing to watch the kids while you work., For those who work nonstandard hours, the majority of child care is provided by family members, often grandparents. Ask your family members if they would be willing to watch your kids while you are at work. This can include parents, siblings, aunts, and uncles., The other common sources of child care for those who work nonstandard hours are close friends and neighbors.

Find a provider.,
Coordinate your schedule.,
Use a combination of care.",How to Find Child Care Outside Normal Work Hours3," Although most child care providers do not work nonstandard hours, you may be able to find one that does. Your local government will likely have a website that will help you find child care in your area. Call around and ask if any of them will watch your child during nonstandard hours. Unfortunately, child care offered during nonstandard hours tends to me more expensive than that offered during regular hours.When you talk to a child care provider, ask things like “Do you watch children at night?” and “What are your rates for evening childcare?”
If you are receiving any government assistance, make sure that your child care provider accepts it.

, If your job allows you some flexibility, consider rearranging your schedule to better align with that of the child care provider. For example, if you work a night shift, ask a coworker who works the day shift if they would be willing to switch with you. You might also talk to your boss about working while your children are at school.With your boss, you might ask things like “Can I work more day shifts so that I can be home with my kids at night?” and “Would it be possible for me to work on weekdays instead of weekends?”

, Many people who are unable to get full-time child care use a combination of family, friend, and group care. For example, you might be able to use a child care provider during regular hours and then leave your kids with a family member when you work at night. Unfortunately, because there are few options available for people that work nonstandard hours, you may have to try multiple options."

If you apply for public assistance to help support your children, you will automatically trigger a state child support filing.If you do not have a support order, and do not qualify for state assistance, you will need to file for a support order in the courts (follow the method on filing an initial child support order).
If you have an existing support order and need to collect on it, you will need to file for enforcement (follow the method on enforcing an existing order).;
, Child support is calculated based on both parties' monthly incomes and the number of persons being supported.The amount settled on will be determined by a number of guidelines provided by Pennsylvania law.One way to estimate the amount of support is to read the the guidelines set out in the Pennsylvania Code. The Code provides guidelines and examples that will give you a good idea of what support you might expect.

Click here for good directions on how to establish paternity.

, Once you know you need to file a new petition for child support, you will need to file your case with the Court of Common Pleas in the county where the child lives. If you have any questions about which court this might be for you, contact your local county Domestic Relations Section., You will need to print, complete, sign, and date the following three documents in order to start your process.The first document is the Application for Child or Spousal Support; the second document is the Complaint for Support; and the third document is the Intake Questionnaire.To access these documents, you will need to register and create an account with the Pennsylvania Child Support Program.To create an account, go here and click the button that says ""Register Now.""

In general, you can ask the other party or potential witnesses to provide you with copies of documents, allow you to inspect items or property, or require them to answer questions under oath (written or oral).

, Either party can request mediation, or the judge can order it without a request from either party. The court can excuse a case from mediation if the court believes there is risk to either party or if mediation will be pointless. In mediation, a neutral third party attempts to bring the parties to an agreement on the issues. There is no need to bring any evidence because the mediator does not make any decisions. The intent is for both parties to compromise so that the issues can be settled without the need for a trial.


If mediation is successful, the mediator will generally prepare the proper documents, obtain the signature of each party, and submit the documents to the court.
If mediation is unsuccessful, the parties will simply proceed to court. In Pennsylvania, statements made in mediation cannot be used in court, attorneys cannot be involved in mediation, and the mediator makes no statements to the court.

Each party will provide opening statements. These opening statements are simple road maps of your case and will provide the judge and the other party with information on how you plan to proceed. For more information about opening statements go here.
Each party will then present their witnesses. In a child support proceeding, witnesses will most likely be employers, friends, family members, and other relevant community members. These witnesses will provide testimony to the court about things such as a party's earnings, daily responsibilities, spending habits, and any other information that will help the judge make a decision about who should pay child support and how much should be paid.
Both parties will then give their closing statements, which is the last chance to give the judge a summary of the case and a statement of why the judge should rule in your favor.

, Once your hearing is over, the judge will make a decision as to how much child support should be paid, if any, to the other party. Once this decision has been made, the order will be filed and the other party will be required to pay you the amount the judge decided on.The order will also provide a conditional order for the attachment of income, which will provide a method by which you can get the money you deserve in case the other party stops paying."

Determine if you have a need to enforce an existing child support order.,
Locate the appropriate court.,
Complete the appropriate forms.,
File your documents.,
Serve the other party.,
Attend your hearing.",How to File for Child Support in Pennsylvania3," If you have gone through the process described in the section about filing a child support order and you are not being paid what is owed, and you do not qualify for assistance from the Office of the Attorney General, you will need to file an enforcement action.

, To start the process, you will need to file your enforcement action with the court that handled your initial child support action. However, if the paying parent has moved out of that jurisdiction, you may need to file in a jurisdiction that has control over that parent.This step will usually only be necessary where the other parent has moved out of Pennsylvania.

, To fill out the required forms, go here and go through the interactive process. This website will ask you a series of questions about your situation and they will use that information to fill out the required forms for you.After you have completed the questionnaire, you can download and print the completed forms., Take your completed and printed documents to the correct local Court of Common Pleas and file them with the clerk of courts. The clerk will take your original documents so be sure to make copies of everything you have. In order to complete the filing process, you will need to pay a fee unless you qualify and apply for a fee waiver.The fees vary from county to county but for example, the fee in York County is $35.50.To qualify for a fee waiver, you will usually need to show proof that you are unable to pay the fee or that doing so would cause you a financial burden. You can usually show this through bank statements or pay stubs. Once you have filed your documents, the clerk of courts will schedule a hearing date.

, When you serve the other party, you will give a copy of your filed documents for them to look over and respond to. To serve the other party, you must provide the required documents to them, either in person or through the mail.This process must be completed within 30 days of filing your documents with the court., You will next attend your scheduled court hearing and present your case to the judge. The case will likely proceed as follows:


Each party will provide opening statements. These opening statements are simple road maps of your case and will provide the judge and the other party with information on how you plan to proceed. For more information about opening statements go here.
Each party will then present their witnesses. In a child support contempt proceeding, witnesses will most likely be employers, friends, family members, bank employees, and other financial officers. These witnesses will provide testimony to the court about why the other party is not paying the required amounts.
Both parties will then give their closing statements, which is the last chance to give the judge a summary of the case and a statement of why the judge should rule in your favor.
Finally, the judge will provide both parties with a ruling. If the ruling is in your favor, the court will use various enforcement methods including passport denial, driver's license suspension, and credit bureau reporting in order to force the other party to pay their fair share of child support.

Ask yourself about your child care beliefs.,
Consider partnering with parents and community.,
Define the teacher's role.,
Talk about expectations for a child in your program.,
Address issues of program diversity.,
Think about how you can offer a positive environment.,
Discuss curriculum priorities.",How to Develop a Child Care Philosophy1," As a care provider, how do you think about children's child care and development? It will help to define clearly what you believe about a child's developmental strengths and needs in order to develop a philosophy of child care.If you are partnering with others to develop your child care philosophy, this will give you an opportunity to better articulate your individual experiences and to learn about the perspective of others.
Considering the role that you believe play, art, dramatic and academic activities should have in a child's life will help you think about your beliefs.
An example of a statement regarding a program's beliefs regarding child care might be: ""We are committed to providing safe, affordable, high-quality service for children living in the South Lake community that is based in hands-on experiential learning."";
, Including parents, community members and care providers at the outset of developing your child care philosophy can help support your child care program. Think about the ways that the community may hold values that inform the child care philosophy you're developing.Involving community partners in developing your child care philosophy may require language translators for non-English speakers.
Children, families, and other child care professionals may all have a stake in the development of your child care philosophy.

, Consider whether you value teacher-led activities, or student-led activities. Teachers can actively lead a child's learning, structure playtime, and present new information, or they can allow the child more independence to explore these areas for herself. When developing your philosophy of child care, decide what sort of role the teacher should play, and why you feel this way.In a play-based program, the teacher's role is typically less dominant, while academic programs tend to be more teacher-led.
Consider what you might want and expect for a child in your program. If you have certain academic goals that you will expect a child to meet, this will affect the role your teacher will be expected to play.
An example of a child care statement regarding the role of a teacher might be: ""We believe our teachers are responsible for the well-being, safety, and learning of every child. Teachers provide information not only through mentorship and role modeling, but through lectures, small group activities and hands-on learning activities."", How do you think a child learns best? You'll have to discuss your ideas about the range of activities included in your program that should lead to every child's benefit, regardless of learning style.Remember that every child has a unique learning style, and all learners will need to be accommodated.
Include a variety of structured learning activities and open-ended ideas, thinking about what you believe is the ideal ratio of both types in the classroom.
An example of a statement reflecting expectations for a child in a child care program might be: ""We believe that all children should have the opportunity to learn from peers of all abilities, and to serve as teachers for their peers.""

, Considering how your program will serve a wide variety of children is an essential part of developing a childcare philosophy. Your students will come from a wide variety of cultural, economic and social backgrounds. They may have disabilities which require accommodation.Include a statement regarding the value that diversity brings to your program.
Be clear regarding what specific strategies and supports you plan to employ to help nurture children in your program who have special needs.
An example of a statement reflecting child care philosophy of diversity might be: ""We believe that every child has an equal value to our program, and actively work to support full inclusion of children with diverse abilities and disabilities, as well as those from all socio-economic, ethnic, and religious backgrounds."", When someone walks into your child care setting, what will they see? A classroom for children should include activities for appropriate child development, including sensory play, academic materials, activities for developing gross motor skills, and materials for dramatic play.Remember that your child care environment should include activities outside as well as inside.
Sensory play materials include sand play, water tables, bubbles, vibrating toys, colorful lights, and play dough. Anything that engages the child's sensory interests can be included in sensory play materials.
Dramatic play includes materials for role playing, costumes, puppets, and more.
Include a statement regarding your belief about a positive setting for child care. For example, ""We support and encourage the development of creative and social skills through opportunities for sensory play through a wide variety of materials."", Do you want your child care to be play-based, or would you prioritize academic goals? While all child care approaches use a mixture of both play and academic learning, different philosophies emphasize one over the other.If you're uncomfortable in unstructured settings, you're unlikely to be satisfied in an environment that prioritizes spontaneity. The curriculum priorities that you incorporate into your own philosophy of child care shouldn't conflict with your own priorities.
Exploring a range of different child care philosophies may help you better understand the range of priorities that your own philosophy of child care may include.
An example of a statement reflecting curriculum priorities might be: ""We believe that children should be treated with respect and dignity, to feel safe and secure, to have opportunities for learning through play, decision-making, and social interaction with their peers."""

Try Montessori methods.,
Explore Reggio-Emilio pedagogy.,
Learn more about Waldorf schools.,
Try cooperative learning groups.",How to Develop a Child Care Philosophy2," Developmental child care emphasizes all areas of a child's development, including physical, cognitive, social, emotional. This is the most common form of child care philosophy currently practiced in the United States. In a developmental child care classroom, you may expect to find a combination of hands-on activities, child-directed and teacher-led activities.Developmental child care is interactive, and has an informal sense.
Learning through play is considered the central focus of the curriculum in a developmental child care program.
The role of the teacher is to provide security, stimulation, support, limits, and affection.

, This child-centered philosophy follows the child's interest and social curiosity. Experiential learning is prioritized over teacher-led learning.Progressive preschools are sometimes termed ""Bank Street Approach"" due to their initial development at the Bank Street College of Education.
The teacher's role is to facilitate the child's interests and intellectual curiosity.

, Montessori philosophies were developed by Dr. Maria Montessori in her study of child development. These methods emphasize the individual child's initiative and independence. Children move through different activities, called ""work"", at their own rate of speed. The self-correcting tasks teach the child directly, while observing other children completing a task allows children to learn from each other.Montessori methods use ""manipulatives"" or small sensory items that the children use to complete a task. Colored blocks, for example, might be manipulatives matched to pictures of colored blocks in an activity.
Montessori classrooms typically contain a range of ages, because each child is encouraged to learn at her own pace.
Some parents choose Montessori methods because they feel it encourages their children to develop leadership skills.

, This child care philosophy uses a combination of developmental and Montessori approaches. It emphasizes creativity and artistic expression, but also collaboration. Reggio-Emilio learning employs group projects based in child-directed curiosity.For example, if a child expresses interest in why a plant grows, a Reggio-Emilio response might be, ""Let's learn more about that!"" From this child-led curiosity, a collaborative interactive project including study of soil, plants, water, and sunlight might result.
Reggio-Emilio is named after the area of Italy in which this pedagogical approach first developed.
One of the goals of Reggio-Emilio is to use collaborative learning to help a child become a better citizen.

, The Waldorf approach, developed by Rudolf Steiner, is a play-based approach. It's characterized by regular, structured routines. Certain days of the week, for instance, will always include the same activities. Creative activities, such as art, music, dance, singing and acting, are emphasized.The programs are well-known for their refusal to incorporate any media, such as reading, computers, videos or electronics into their curriculum.
There are no grades in a Waldorf program. There are no hand-outs, homework, or tests.
The Waldorf approach emphasized the holistic nature of the child: body, spirit, and soul.

, Parent-cooperative programs, known as co-ops,are formed by parents to offer a shared setting for their children. These programs are created by parents who desire a strong influence in their children's daily activities. The teachers, director and and helpers of the classes are chosen by the parents, and are parents of children in the program.Cooperative learning tends to prioritize values of cooperation and resolving conflicts.
One of the ways in which cooperative learning emphasizes education is that your child sees your participation in the classroom. This allows the child to know that education is a priority for you, and encourages the message that learning is important.

""Let us have fun together"": Allow your child to choose an activity and get engaged in it.,
""Willingness to listen to your child"": This instills in a child the feeling of his importance.,
""Have a conversation with your child"": Talking with each other about various interests that both the parent and the child have, even if it means talking about movies or ways of arranging the closet.,
""Admit your mistake and say I am sorry"": When as a parent you are wrong, apologize to your child.,
""Love your child no matter what"": There's nothing most valuable than saying to your child 'I love you' even if he doesn't get good grades or couldn't make it in a sports team.,
""Ice-breaking with anger and retaliation"": A smile from you, to your angry child, is an ice-breaker for reducing his anger.,
""Exhibit your child's achievements"": Happy child is a confident child and prominently, displaying his small and big achievements at home, to begin with, encourages him to be more hardworking and challenging.,
""Give responsibility and remember to encourage, these are two sides of the same coin"": My kids got hamsters as pets of their choice.,
""Feel nostalgic"": Create an aura of nostalgia with your kids by examining their previous years of work including certificates, pictures, homework, stories, art and projects.,
""Say good job"": Making your child responsible for daily chores or any activity is not sufficient.,
""Role model behavior by older sibling"": Involve the older sibling to motivate your child through activities like teaching him a board game, reading books in front of him and reading to him.",How to Encourage Your Kids," It might be even cleaning the back yard or washing the car or simply word search. The idea is to have fun and not be stressed.;
, He becomes more confident and subsequently, learns to express clearly with delight. It doesn't matter what the child is speaking about. Your listening ears motivate your child to share his experiences with you in the future. You are his confidante!

, Here the idea is an ultimate endeavor to understand each other deeply.

, Its okay to convey to the kids the fact you can't be right all the time. Parents don't have answers all the time and they can go wrong. As you say 'sorry', it does wonders to your child's self-esteem and he learns to be humbly responsible for his actions and thoughts.

, Hug him for being part of you and tell him you have no regrets about it. Appreciating his sincere efforts for that cause, even in that moment of sadness, will motivate him to move on with even greater force and tranquility.

, Even though momentarily, it subsides with a continual laugh on a joke! Allow your child to let out this negative energy by either talking to himself in front of the mirror or running laps. The idea is to drain away your child's negative energy and then engage the positive energy towards constructive purpose like painting or legos. The less retaliated your child feels, he will have more potential for getting encouraged.

, Your child will be receptive to attempting new interests and hobbies.

, They religiously feed, clean and play with them. Allowing them to do so and other normal chores like picking trash, preparing their favorite meal, makes them feel as if they are more in control of their own world, which in turn aspires them for bigger and better goals and interests in life.

, They will carefully observe their progress over the years and feel motivated to continue getting better. Kids doing it alone might do the magic too!

, Let him know that he has done a good job, either by hugging, giving thumbs up or treating him to his favorite delicacy.

, The purpose is two pronged: older sibling develops leadership qualities and motivates the younger child to involve himself actively in those acts. Your older child acts as a change agent encouraging your younger kids.

Let them pick a hairstyle.,
Set some sensible ground-rules.,
Talk to other parents.,
Teach your child how to do laundry.,
Talk about make-up together.,
Keep an eye on the big picture.",How to Dress a 12 Year Old," At 12, a child is old enough to be making decisions about what kinds of clothes they want to wear on a daily basis. You can always do a check before they run out the door to make sure nothing obscene is happening.


If you're in the habit of setting out your child's clothes before school, now is a good time to stop. Let them make the decisions about what they need to wear.
If it's OK for something to be in the closet, your child should be allowed to wear it when they wish. What your child wears to school should be up to them, within reason.;
, If your 12 year-old is suddenly really into clothes, it only makes sense to let them have more input in what kinds of clothes they own. At this stage, it may be appropriate to go to the store once or twice a year during the school year, and give your child the opportunity to pick out a few items within your budget.


Don't just buy them clothes. Sudden growth-spurts can make it tough to dress a pre-teen, so you need to make sure items fit properly and flatter your child. Take them to the store with you.
Some 12 year-olds may be perfectly content to let a parent continue picking out clothes for them, while others may suddenly have a new-found interest in what's ""cool."" Both of these are normal reactions. It's still good to get some input.

, Pre-teens usually start to have more of an opinion about wearing cool clothes, which means cheap options like Gymboree and Target may be tough to find the right kinds of clothes any more. For a lot of options in a relatively small space, it's a good bet to head to the mall. This can help a pre-teenager feel more mature.


Let your kid explore different stores and try on clothes. As long as something is appropriate and within your budget, let your child have some input. Make a day of it.
Hand-me-downs might be an essential part of staying in budget for your family, but try to get the kid new clothes every now and then. You can still shop on a budget. Make it clear what you can afford to spend before you head to the mall, and let your child make decisions about how to spend that money.

, As a pre-teen, your child is struggling to form some kind of identity and fit in with other classmates. One easy way to let your child have more of a sense of identity is to let them experiment some. If your child wants to try a crazy new hairstyle, indulge them. If they want to stick to a more traditional cut you may enjoy more, that's great too. It'll always grow back.

, Tell your pre-teen that they can begin to decide for themselves what they can buy to wear, provided that they can demonstrate responsible restraint in both costs and types of clothing. Set a few basic ground rules that you'd decide on together. These may include things like:


No overly revealing or crude messages on clothing.
Nothing over a certain price price point.
Clothes must be clean and fit properly.

, Pre-teens will often become obsessed with clothing, suddenly. As a parent, it can be hard to balance your desire to provide for your child and help them fit in with your inability to figure out what a middle-schooler thinks is ""cool."" For help, try reaching out to teachers, parents, and other adults with kids that are the same age as your own. This can be an invaluable resource in helping you to decode the signals your child is giving you.


If your kid comes home suddenly hating all their clothes and wanting to wear something unusual, talk to other parents. Find out if their kids have done similar things lately. It could be a new trend you don't know about.
Find out about what kinds of rules other parents have for their own kids' wardrobe. Try and find out whether or not you're more or less strict than other parents. That doesn't mean you need to change, but it's helpful to know.

, If your 12 year-old is tearing through shirts and pants at a great clip, your laundry is probably going to start to pile up. To help your child start to make sensible clothing decisions, it's also a good idea to teach them how to manage laundry at your house. Develop a system whereby your pre-teens can help in some way with this chore.


Even if you don't want your child doing laundry alone, let them know the process. Teach them how to do it and let them help. This will show them that wearing a t-shirt once and then throwing it in the hamper probably isn't necessary.

, If your child wants to wear make-up, it'll be important to establish some rules. At this age, you may think it's time to teach your child how to apply an appropriate amount of make-up, or you may not. Make some ground rules that fit into your particular ideas about what's appropriate for a 12 year-old.


Use your child's interest as a teachable moment. If your 12 year-old wants to learn about make-up, show them how to apply it appropriately instead of denying them and letting them try and figure it out in the bathroom at school.

, So your 12 year-old wants to wear combat boots and a frilly pink skirt at the same time to school. Is this actually going to cause a problem? You may struggle to think of a pre-teen's clothing choices as making much sense, but at this stage your child is struggling to find an identity and relate to their peers. Try and give them the benefit of the doubt and do what you can to make this transition smooth, instead of combative. Your ideas about what is appropriate and inappropriate can be flexible.

Start looking for a daycare well before your child will be ready to attend.,
Make the transition easier by looking for some key aspects of a quality daycare.,
Look for a daycare that has a set schedule.,
Take the time to meet the staff.,
Talk to other parents that send their children to the daycare you are looking at.",How to Deal with Sending Your Child to Daycare1," If you know ahead of time that you will be sending your child to daycare, it is a good idea to start looking at various locations well before the planned first day. This will give both you and your child some extra time to adjust to the new situation.;
, Taking the time to choose a daycare is important because both you and your child need to feel comfortable about your child being there, rather than at home. To make the transition easier, try to find a daycare that is close to your home or office so that dropping off your child and picking him or her will be convenient. You should also look for a daycare that:


Is clean, organized, and have enough staff to take care of the needs of all of the children that are enrolled.
It should have enough indoor room for the children to move freely and various types of toys should be within reach of the children.
There should also be a play area outside which is fenced in, well maintained, and has a good selection of outdoor toys.

, Choosing a daycare that follows a daily schedule makes the transition easier because once your child has gone to the daycare a couple of times, he or she will know what to expect and will be less hesitant about attending.


Aside from meals, snacks, and naps, there should be time on the schedule that is designated for free play, teacher-led play, and educational activities.

, Even more important than the set-up and daily schedule of the daycare is the interaction between the staff and the children, and to a slightly lesser degree, between the other parents and the staff. The staff should be caring and nurturing toward your child and treat the parents with respect.


A good way to determine this is to set up a time when you and your child can spend a few hours at the daycare to see what it is like. This also gives your child a chance to meet some of the other children that they will be seeing daily.

, Although a scheduled visit is often a good indicator of how a daycare runs, there are some daycare facilities where the staff is on their best behavior when they know there are visitors. In order to be more certain that the daycare is a good fit for your family, try talking to some of the other parents that bring their children to the daycare.


You can also consider returning to the daycare for an unannounced visit. However, make sure that you return at the same time, such as the beginning of the day, so that you do not interrupt nap time or some other scheduled activity.

Set up some practice days.,
Create a routine for yourself.,
Know that it’s okay to feel sad.,
Keep the big picture in mind.,
Be open and honest with your child about why they are going to daycare.,
Focus on the positive.",How to Deal with Sending Your Child to Daycare2," If your child has never been away from home for more than a few hours, it can help some parents to have a few practice days to acclimate to the idea of sending their child to daycare for a full day.


Although some daycare facilities will accept new children on a trial basis, it isn’t always an option. Instead, you can set up a mock daycare where your child can be dropped off for an entire day at the home of a relative or babysitter.

, On the practice days, you should try to go through the routine that you will follow when your child is actually at daycare. This involves getting your child ready and out the door in plenty of time to take them to the daycare and get to work or other appointments without rushing. By following the planned routine, you can work on any issues that might make you late.

, Making all of the necessary plans and practicing ahead of time can help to ease your mind, but you might find that it does not do anything to combat the heartache you feel when thinking about being separated from your child. These are very strong emotions that often ease with time.

, If you are feeling sad or guilty about sending your child to daycare, think about the big picture—you need to work, or go to school in order to support your child. Doing the things you will do while your child is at daycare will help to provide your child with a brighter future.


Sometimes it is hard to see the bigger picture when you are dropping your child off at daycare, but repeating an affirmation may help. When repeated over and over, a positive affirmation has a calming effect that can ease your negative feelings. Remind yourself that you are doing the right thing and say to yourself, “My child must go to daycare so that I can do ___ to provide him/her with a better future”.

, Some parents get worried that their children will resent them for sending them to daycare. However, if you talk to your child openly and honestly about why they are going to daycare, your child will not harbor these negative feelings.


To help your child remember that you love them, put your picture in a locket, or give your child a picture of you to keep with them at daycare. Then show your child that you also have a picture of them that you keep at all times.
When you get home and pick up your child, spend some special time with them talking about their day and doing something fun together.

, Thinking positive thoughts is a good way to hold off anxious or guilty thoughts. Try to think about all of the good things that will come out of your child being at daycare:


You will be able to go to work or school, your child will make new friends and learn new things, and your child will get to explore a totally new environment.
There is also the benefit of being taught things like the alphabet, counting, and other concepts that your child will need to know when they attend school.

Be prepared for some pick-up and drop-off hiccups along the way.,
Know that you may have to pick your child up early on occasion.,
Check in with the manager about the food the daycare is serving if your child has specific needs.,
Know that your child may have separation anxiety.",How to Deal with Sending Your Child to Daycare3," Inserting daycare into your daily schedule can be a challenge. Arrangements need to be made regarding which parent will drop off and pick up the child each day. You will also have to come up with a backup plan if your partner (or yourself) gets held up and make it to daycare on time.


For example, if you were to get stuck and traffic and your partner is in a meeting, you will need to have a person, like a relative, you can call that can go and pick up your child for you.

, There may some days where your child slips and cuts his knee or sustains some other injury. On those occasions, if the wound is bad enough or the child is inconsolable, you might have to come and pick your child up early.


However, keep in mind that daycare staff members are usually certified in First Aid Training and CPR, so they will be capable of handling any emergencies.

, Most daycare facilities will post menus near the entrance to the building. If you are worried about the nutritional value of the meals that are served, or your child has special food needs, you can usually talk with the manager about your concerns.


Daycares that accept infants will usually ask that the parents provide the formula or expressed breast milk as well as details about feeding the infant, such as how much and how often they eat. The formula or breast milk is kept separate and labeled for each infant so there are no mix-ups that result in cross-usage.

, One of the biggest challenges that parents face when sending a child to daycare is separation anxiety. Simply put, some children have a very tough time coping with being away from their parents. It can be heartbreaking to walk away from your child when they are crying and clinging to you. If this is happening, take a moment to explain (again) what is happening and express your love to your child. Tell them when you will be back and what you will be doing while you are gone. Then, say goodbye and calmly leave the daycare.


The staff should be well trained in helping both you and your child through this challenge. They will do everything that they can in order to comfort your child and help them adjust to being at the daycare. They will often call the parent later in the day to let them know that the child is doing well.
Sometimes, they have one of the staff members stay with the child until they are calm and ready to play and participate in the group activities.
They might also set up a play buddy for the child so that they don’t feel alone.

Children go through this stage at different times and to varying degrees, but it’s normal and not a reason to worry. Do not reject, scold, or punish your child for her clinginess; you will only make an already vulnerable child feel neglected and frightened.Certain normal developmental stages are often clingy for kids, such as when she is an older baby and becoming more mobile by learning to crawl or walk; when she is young toddler learning to communicate using words; and when she goes through big changes such as starting daycare or preschool. This is because the older she gets, the more she learns and comprehends that she is separate from you. She is also learning simultaneously about the dangers in the world, and she may feel alone and unprotected. She clings to you for reassurance that she has someone on her side in a big and scary world.;
, You may notice that certain circumstances make your child nervous or uncomfortable. Try to pinpoint which issues make your child behave especially anxious, so you can predict when the clinginess will be at its worst.


Are there certain situations that stress your child out the most? Socializing with other children? Going to school? See if you can identify common themes, and talk to any teachers or other caregivers to determine whether your child manages these situations when you are not present.
Some toddlers and young preschoolers experience intense clinginess during drop-off at daycare or preschool, crying and acting terrified. Often this behavior stops the moment the child's parent has left. Ask the teacher to help you at drop-off so that you can leave quickly and not drag out the inevitable. Reassure your child you will be back, and then leave quickly., Is it possible that you are unintentionally causing the clingy behavior? Some parents protect their children too much, trying to prevent them from physical injuries or negative emotions. You may need to relax a little before your child can feel comfortable asserting his independence.


Try to encourage your child's independence by telling him how strong and brave he is, and by encouraging him to try new things. As long as he is safe, let him walk a few steps away from you at the park or library and play with other children. Let him climb up on the jungle gym or explore your backyard without hovering too close.
Try not to overreact when your child is injured. If it’s a small fall, for example, wait to see if he is hurt before rushing to her side.

, While clinginess can be completely normal for children, it is also possible your child may have a disorder that must be addressed. Adjustment disorder, attachment disorders, and separation anxiety all have clinginess as a symptom. If you are concerned that your child has one of the following disorders, speak to her pediatrician about treatment. In this situation, you may benefit from the help of a therapist or specialist in child behavior.Adjustment Disorder: Occurs following a traumatic or difficult event (such as moving, divorce, starting school, etc).The child struggles to adjust to life after the event, and she may display the following signs: abnormally anxious or depressed, difficulty sleeping, regular crying spells, displaying hostility and picking fights, isolating and refusing to go to school.Attachment Disorder: The child has difficulty connecting with others, usually caused by abuse, neglect, or instability during the first three years of life.The child will display a lack of trust, have difficulty showing affection, an aversion to physical touch or affection, anger in the form of tantrums or passive-aggressive behavior, obsession with being in control, lack of guilt or remorse, and may be clingy and demanding.Separation Anxiety: Children with separation anxiety usually come from close-knit families and exhibit high levels of anxiety and/or fear when separated from those to whom she is attached. She may experience sadness, difficulty concentrating, social withdrawal, heightened fear of perceived dangers (like animals, burglars, car accidents, etc) to family members or herself, inability to sleep without the other person being nearby or be afraid to sleep away from home, clinginess, anger and even violence against someone forcing separation.To qualify as separation anxiety, the child must display these symptoms for at least four weeks., If your child is going through an especially clingy phase, it’s okay to try to avoid the situations that make your child overly clingy. Just as you might avoid a situation that causes anxiety for you, it's ok to avoid situations that do the same thing to your child.Be aware, too, that hunger and tiredness can exacerbate clingy behaviors.
Once you have pinpointed the situations that seem to make your child anxious, you can avoid these situations entirely. For example, if crowded playgrounds or play dates with particular people make the problem worse, avoid them until your child becomes a bit more independent.
If you can't avoid the situation outright, you can also compromise by adapting the situation to make it more acceptable to your child. For example, you could go to the playground when it is less crowded early in the morning, or have a playdate that requires less one-on-one time (for instance, meet up with your child's friend and his parents at the zoo or aquarium).
This strategy will only work if your child's clinginess is relatively short-lived. If your child is experiencing intense anxiety and it has lasted several months, and if it interferes with your daily life or his ability to meet normal developmental milestones, ask your pediatrician for an evaluation. It is possible that your child has social anxiety or another social development disorder that is affecting his ability to become independent., If you cannot avoid a particular situation, do your best to prepare your child for it. Explain where you are going, what you will be doing, and what kind of behavior you expect.


Even if your child is only a baby or toddler and doesn't yet speak much, you can explain in simple terms what to expect. Babies understand language much sooner than they can speak.Use short, simple sentences and a lot of detail, for example, ""Today we are going to go to the doctor! Remember Doctor Smith? She takes good care of you! She will look in your eyes, and in your ears, and listen to your heart. She will see how much you weight. You will get a shot in your arm, and it will hurt, but it will be over very quickly and then Doctor Smith will give you a sucker!"" For a very anxious child, you can also act out the scenario.
If your child seems especially upset when you leave her in the care of someone else, take the time to prepare for this, too. Explain that you understand how your child feels and that her feelings are okay. Emphasize the fun she will have, and remind your child that you will return. Never sneak away; simply explain what’s going on, and keep a positive attitude. Sneaking will only teach your child not to trust you.

, Offer your child some freedom and independence where appropriate. You may need to get over your own fears and apprehensions before your child can do the same.


Let your child acclimate to independence gradually, by spending time playing alone. Instead of structuring your child's entire day or trying to interact with him constantly, allow him to entertain himself for small periods of time. He may like to look at books, color, build with blocks, or play with dolls. If your child is a young toddler, he may only be able to play alone for a few minutes at a time, but by the time he is four or five years old he should be able to spend an hour or more in imaginative play.At a playground or other public place, take one step back from where you normally stand while the child plays. As long as your child is mobile and able to safely navigate the playground equipment, continue to take a step back each time you take your child to the playground, until you are sitting on a bench nearby. Offer encouragement and support, and stay involved by actively watching (no playing on your phone!), but try not to hover too closely.

, A clingy child is seeking shelter and safety. Do not reject, ignore, or scold your child for this behavior. Offer hugs and reassurance as you encourage independence.


One way to reassure an anxious toddler or child is to let her know what you are doing. If you are going into the next room, tell her. Say, ""I have to put my cup in the sink, but I will be right back."" If you are leaving him at school or daycare, tell her that you are leaving rather than disappearing when she's not looking. Even if it is harder because she cries, she will feel that she can trust your word and know what to expect, and she won't have to worry that you will disappear.If your child is experiencing a lot of stress because of times that you have to spend apart, try to spend extra time cuddling, reading stories, or playing in the yard together. Your child may need extra attention to feel secure on days like that., Try to understand your child’s fear and anxiety, and explain why a particular situation is safe without undermining those feelings. Tell your child that you understand how she feels, even as you work towards making your child less clingy.


Remember that young children have been in the world a very short time, and their frames of reference are very limited. Fears that seem silly to adults are overwhelming to a very young child. Respect your child by taking her fears seriously and trying to help her understand and master them, instead of telling her that her emotions are silly or that she is acting like a baby.

, Remember, a clingy phase is normal and healthy developmentally. You do not want to make your child feel badly because he needs you and is acting on a normal developmental phase. Punishing will not help the situation, and will only confuse your child.Remember that a clingy child trusts you to care for his needs. If you yell at him or chastise him for his clinginess, you leave him with no one whom he can count on to support him.

, If you have a clingy child who is experiencing acute separation anxiety, try to separate gradually. Leave your child for a few minutes at a time, then come back. Increase the period of time gradually, until your child adjusts to the idea of a temporary separation.


When you are playing together at home, say, ""Oh, I forgot my water in the kitchen. I will be right back!"" Go and get it and come right back; don't dawdle. She will see that you are reliable and that you come back.
The next time you leave the room, do something that takes a little longer. For example, you might say, ""I need to put a load of laundry in. I will be back in a few minutes!"" Each time you need to leave the room, try to be gone a minute or two longer.

, Children who are uncomfortable with change may become less clingy if you build a regular routine. Doing so allows them to know what will happen in advance. Explain to your child, for example, that every day, after lunch, you will wash the dishes; note that your child will need to play alone during that time.


It can be especially helpful to establish patterns and routines during parts of the day when your child is especially clingy or anxious. If your child struggles with drop-off at school, for instance, you might establish a ritual of putting his snack in his cubby, greeting the teacher, hugging you goodbye, and giving you a high five as he heads off to his seat.
Bedtime rituals also provide structure and predictability for children who become clingy at the mention of sleep. One soothing routine includes a warm bath, a lotion massage, pajamas, a story, a song, and then bed. You can also introduce a simple phrase or special way of saying goodnight, such as ""I love you lots! I will see you when you wake up in the morning!"" This provides some reassurance that you will be there when the child wakes., Help your child feel confident and independent by giving her a specific task to accomplish. These small accomplishments will help your child develop a sense of self-worth and independence as well as a can-do attitude that will translate to later attempts at new tasks.The task you choose should correspond to your child's age and ability, but some ideas include picking up her toys, setting the table, folding wash cloths or towels, sorting laundry to wash, checking the mail, or washing the vegetables for dinner. You may want to focus on tasks that you know your child can do but that she frequently asks you to do for her, like putting on her shoes or washing her hands.
Consider creating a simple rewards chart with the days of the week across the top of the chart, and the chores or tasks down the side of the chart. For every completed task, let your child place a sticker in the corresponding spot. When your child has filled in the chart or received a set amount of stickers (ten, for example), you can reward her with a trip to the splash pad or an ice cream cone.

, Play groups and play dates will expose your child to other children, some of whom are less clingy; these social opportunities will also encourage your child to have fun and develop relationships away from you.


If your child is especially clingy in these situations, try to make sure your child knows at least one other child involved. Stay around, and tell your child that you will be there; remove yourself from these situations gradually, as your child feels more comfortable.

, Get your child interested in playing independently (or with other children) by changing the environment or offering a new toy or game. If you usually play in the backyard, go to the park; if your child usually builds with blocks, try a craft project.


Consider visiting your local library to find information on local play groups, meet ups, and story times. These can be a great way to break out of a monotonous routine.

, Greet your child with hugs and kisses in the morning, and set a positive tone for the day.


Children who receive a lot of love in the form of physical affection tend to have a closer bond with their caregivers, which creates a feeling of safety and reassurance. It also bolsters brain growth, social skills, and self-confidence, all of which will help your child feel more secure in the world, and thus less likely to cling to you in unfamiliar situations., Clingy children will feel more secure and independent if they know that their parents are there for them. Make sure to spend time with your child every day, free of distractions — no TV, phone, or other electronics. Listen to your child, and offer him 100% of your attention.


Try spending time at the local library, park, or in your own backyard. Sit down on your child's level and engage in play with your child, on your child's terms. Follow his lead.
For best results, incorporate this focused time together into your routine. If, say, you plan to do this every day after lunch, your child will know to expect it. He will be less likely to cling at other times.

, Whenever your child does play alone or take other steps outside of her comfort zone, offer plenty of praise and enthusiasm. Make sure your child knows that you recognize and appreciate the effort.Praising your child for trying something new or otherwise showing independence teaches her that you notice the hard work it takes to master a new skill. If your child is a people-pleaser, she will want to continue doing independent things like this in order to please you and garner more praise.Be sure not to fall into the habit of over-doing your praise, which can backfire for a anxious and unsure child. Some children interpret praise as an evaluation of their effort and even their worth, and can then become self-conscious about trying new things that are difficult for fear that their parents will not be proud of them anymore if they fail.For example, you might praise your child's bravery or willingness to try something new, rather than putting a lot of emphasis on the end result. Let your child know it is admirable to take a risk and work at something.Avoid praising things that are not really accomplishments. It is not necessary to celebrate everything your child does (""You finished your vegetables! Hooray!""),as this can dilute her actual achievements and also make her feel she constantly has to impress you.

, When you must leave your clingy child for awhile, encourage him to create a drawing that expresses his feelings. This shows that you care and gives your child something to focus on in your absence.


Increasingly, art therapy is used to treat anxiety and other issues in children, who don't always have the words to express how they're feeling.Although you may not be able to evaluate your child's artwork like a trained psychologist, you can look for themes to see what might be troubling your child. Is he afraid to be alone because he thinks something might happen to him, or because he thinks you will not come back? Ask him questions about his picture to try to understand his clinginess.

, Every child is different. Clinginess is a normal stage, and your child will grow out of it on her own timetable.


In the meantime, don't forget to take care of yourself. It can be emotionally draining to have a child who constantly clings to you, so take time to relax and do something you enjoy while your child is safe with a family member or sitter.

Watch out for problems that can arise from Earwax build up.,
Seek the help of a doctor if you notice either of the two problems listed in the previous step.,
Be prepared for the process the ENT will perform.,
Bring your child back as often as necessary.,
Follow the doctor’s orders.,
Use a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water.,
Lay your child on her unaffected side.,
Place about 10 drops of liquid inside your baby’s ears.,
Let the liquid stay in the ear for at least a minute or two.,
Do not practice Earwax candling.",How to Clean Baby Ear Wax," Earwax build up is very normal and usually doesn’t cause any problems. However, in certain instances, the Earwax does cause a problem and medical attention is needed. These instances include:


When the Earwax build up impedes inspection of the ear drums down the middle and inner ear for signs of ear infection.
When the Earwax buildup blocks the ear canal completely, so much that it causes hearing problems. Sometimes this resolves on its own but there are times when the duration is so long that it interferes with a baby’s normal hearing and speech development.;
, ENT doctors (ear, nose and throat doctors) have special equipment that they can use to clean the inner ear. You must be prepared though, because this might hurt your baby since the middle and inner ears are quite sensitive, so any pressure placed in those parts of the ear will cause a bit of discomfort. The ENT doctor will know what to do and how to handle a baby when scooping out the Earwax becomes necessary.

, Usually, the ENT doctor will examine the baby’s ears with an otoscope, a medical equipment that lets the ENT see into your baby’s ears. Then if deemed ok, the doctor will use a curette or a plastic spoon to scoop put the Earwax from your baby’s ears. If scooping out the wax is not possible, the doctor will irrigate the baby’s ear with warmed water (cool water will cause dizziness), sodium bicarbonate, hydrogen peroxide or other prescription ear drops.


The doctor will hold your baby’s head to the opposite side of the affected ear (if the right ear is to be cleaned, the doctor will tilt your baby’s head to the left) and put about four to five drops of either warmed water or prescription ear drops. The doctor will allow the fluid to settle in the ear and then gently tilt your baby’s head back to normal or completely to the other side to let the fluid drain out together with the Earwax.

, This procedure may be repeated by the doctor as necessary to clean the middle and inner ears. If there is still a substantial amount of Earwax left inside the ear, it will be easier to remove the second time around, as it will already be softened.

, You will be given instructions by the doctor on how to clean your baby’s ears at home, especially if your baby actively produces too much Earwax too frequently which can impede hearing and balance. A normal rinsing technique follows the procedure listed below.

, Your doctor may recommend mixing equal parts hydrogen peroxide and warm water to use to rinse out your baby’s ear.Your doctor may also prescribe over the counter solutions, like Debrox.

, To help keep your baby calm, you can feed her while you clean her ear. You can also talk soothingly to her, or even sing. You could also ask another adult to help you hold your baby in place while applying the medication.


After positioning your child, hold the dropper you will use to apply the solution. Place it in your fist to help warm up the hydrogen peroxide mixture or medication.

, Be prepared for squirming and screaming or crying, as the drops can make your baby feel uncomfortable. Work quickly because otherwise your baby may begin fighting you off. This could make it much harder to actually get the medication into your baby’s ear.

, The longer you can keep your baby still, the better. Once the time has passed, sit your baby upright, and let the Earwax slowly drain out of her ear. Once the softened Earwax is out of the ear, and you can see it on the outer ear, gently wipe it away with a warm, wet washcloth.


Repeat this process at least once a day for the next three to five days.

, Please note that Earwax candling is not recommended by doctors because the procedure entails the use of a hollow cone like structure made of beeswax and paraffin with cloth at the tapered end. This end is inserted in the ear while the other tip of the cone is lighted with fire and allowed to burn for a few seconds.


The idea is to create a vacuum inside the ears to suction out the Earwax but repeated studies have shown that it doesn’t work and it does not have any beneficial effects to the patient.

Understand that young boys are always on the go.,
Provide opportunities for controlled chaos.,
Teach him responsibility.,
Monitor his physical behavior.,
Use firmness and kindness when correcting him.,
Model good behavior for him.,
Encourage him to express his ideas and feelings.",How to Deal with Boys1," By the time they’re toddlers, boys begin developing gross motor skills at a faster rate than girls of the same age. This means that most young boys are always moving, bouncing, running, kicking, and seemingly trying to hurt themselves in increasingly inventive ways.Channel that energy into activities such as sports, play time, and even household chores.


Ensuring your boy gets plenty of opportunities for exercise, especially outdoor exercise, will help tire him out.;
, Developing children need space to get messy. They need to be able to spread LEGO bricks all over the floor while building a spaceship, or to make a pillow fort to defend themselves from evil monsters. Playing builds cognitive and spatial skills and promotes creative, flexible thinking.Young boys especially can make a mess when they play, but if you provide some ground rules and some flexibility, you can help your child learn how to understand the world around him safely -- if not always neatly.


Provide a safe outdoor play area with toys such as a sandbox or treehouse to give him room to play and run around. Accept that messes and dirt are a part of parenting a young boy. In fact, research suggests that getting dirty can actually strengthen your child’s immune system!You can also allow your child to build a fort in his room or another low-traffic area in the house.
Set rules for playing, such as that toys have to be picked up and put away before dinner time or that muddy wrestling can only happen outdoors.

, Children need to learn independence and cooperation with others. It may be tempting to do everything for your child because it’s faster and easier, but it’s important to let your child figure things out on his own (under safe, supervised conditions). Keep your expectations realistic, however. Most boys’ fine motor skills don’t develop as fast as girls’ do, so tasks that require a lot of coordination may take extra time and practice for your young boy to learn.Give your child more responsibility in stages. When he’s very young, putting away toys and doing “pretend” chores (such as playing with pans while you cook or wiping a dust cloth along the furniture) are good starts. As he gets older, your child can handle increased responsibilities such as keeping his room clean, helping with the dishes, and doing his homework without as much help.

, Young boys are prone to displays of aggression, particularly physical aggression. Very physical play such as wrestling and play-fighting is normal and appropriate for young boys, and making toy weapons such as swords and guns out of literally anything they can find is also very common behavior. However, these behaviors should promote positive, friendly interactions between your child and his friends, so keep an eye out to make sure your child is not engaging in hostile or bullying actions.If you notice that your child is hurting others or doesn’t seem to understand when to call a truce while play-fighting, talk with him about empathy, or putting himself in his friends’ shoes. Just as he doesn’t want to be hurt or bullied, he shouldn’t hurt others, and he should understand that sometimes what doesn’t hurt him can still hurt someone else. These conversations should start early and can help boys develop into healthy, well-adjusted adults.

, Because boys tend to be very physical as children, they may resort to physical and verbal aggression in order to get their way. It may be very difficult for young boys to understand why acts of parental aggression, such as spanking or severe scolding and yelling, are acceptable while their own aggression is not. In fact, children who experience severe punishment as children are more likely to become aggressive as they develop.Instead, model how you want him to interact with others by being firm but kind when you correct your child. State your expectations for his behavior clearly, and talk to him about what he’s doing wrong. Teach him how to express his feelings using words, such as statements like “I’m feeling angry.”For example, if you notice that your child has not put his toys away, tell him firmly but kindly that he needs to put them away. Give him a clear understanding of his goal and the consequences, like this: “Please put all these toys on the floor back in the toy-box. You won’t be able to go outside and play until they’re put away.”
Emphasize empathy whenever possible. Explain the consequences of his behavior on other people, and ask your boy to imagine how he would feel if someone did the same to him.
Be kind and praise him when he does well so that your child knows that you are happy about his good behavior. If you focus only on correcting negative behaviors without reinforcing positive ones, you may actually end up promoting acting out.
Ignore it when he whines. Whining is a form of power struggle, and while giving in may be easier in the short run, it’s actually damaging to your authority as a parent. If he wants something he can have, tell him what he needs to do to get it; for example, “If you want to watch cartoons, you have to put your toys away first.” If he wants something he can’t have, clearly explain why: “You can’t have ice cream right now. Ice cream isn’t good for you to have at breakfast.”

, Children learn a lot about how to interact with others from their parents. Teach your young boy how to interact with others by modeling healthy behaviors for him, such as speaking kindly to others and being patient even in challenging circumstances. Reward and praise him for being polite and kind, as well as for good behaviors such as putting toys away and doing homework.Be consistent; for example, if you don’t want your child swearing, don’t swear in front of him. It will be almost impossible for a young boy to understand why his parents can say “bad” words but he can’t.

, Boys in particular often face strong cultural pressure to “not be a wuss” or otherwise not to express their emotions. However, this pressure isn’t healthy.Help him learn how to express himself to others with his words and actions without being unkind or hurtful. Everyone gets frustrated or angry sometimes, and so will your boy; rather than feeling guilty about these emotions or denying them, help him learn that his reactions to them can be managed in a healthy way.Teach him that he’s responsible for how he reacts to the feelings he experiences. He may be angry that someone else took his toy, but while it’s understandable to feel upset, it’s not acceptable to translate that emotion into an action such as name-calling or hitting.
Understand that boys may need more comforting than girls do during stress or frustration. Research suggests that young girls may be more effective than young boys at self-soothing when they’re agitated."
"
Understand his teenage brain.,
Remember that his hormones will affect his ability to communicate.,
Acknowledge his emotions.,
Help him learn maturity.,
Pick your battles.,
Talk with him honestly about sex.,
Be active in his life, but don’t be overbearing.,
Let him sleep.,
Provide good nutrition.",How to Deal with Boys2," The teenage brain is very different from a fully developed adult’s brain. The areas of the brain responsible for “mature” behavior -- such as impulse control, long-term thinking, and advance planning -- are among the last areas of the brain to mature, and they also mature slower in boys. This means that your teenage boy may literally not be capable of really considering the consequences of his actions.Because the teenage brain is in a constant state of development, it’s also the perfect time for learning positive behaviors. The new neural networks constantly being established mean that your teenage boy’s brain is inclined to curiosity, development, and experimentation, which can be channeled into useful pursuits such as sports, hobbies, and personal relationships.

, By the time they hit age 10 or 11, boys’ systems are constantly being swamped with hormones like testosterone, which promotes feelings of aggression and impulsivity.The teenage brain also experiences emotional responses at a much higher level of intensity than young children and adults,which can mean that your teen boy is more prone to emotional outbursts.Try to avoid seeming judgmental when you interact with your teen. Teenagers are extremely sensitive to criticism, so there’s a big difference between “You’re going to school in that?” and “I’d prefer that you not wear that to school.”

, Because teenagers experience most emotions more intensely than adults, it’s especially important for you to acknowledge your boy’s feelings as valid, even if they seem blown out of proportion or completely foreign to you. Experts suggest that acknowledging negative emotions allows them to dissipate faster than denying them, so if your teen boy is feeling sad or angry (and these things will happen!), let him know you understand he’s experiencing those emotions. For example, if your teenage boy experiences a disappointment such as not being picked for a sports team, he may feel angry and hurt about not being selected. Rather than deny those feelings by saying something like “It’s not so bad, don’t get torn up about it,” try telling him that you acknowledge his feelings and then offer encouragement: “I understand it was really disappointing for you not to be picked for the team. That really sucks. It’s upsetting right now, but there will be other opportunities in the future.”

, Feelings of rebellion are very common for adolescent boys. While they can cause significant conflict between you and your son, it’s important to understand that these feelings are important for your child to develop his own moral compass.Try to keep defiance in perspective. If your teenage boy is defying rules that are meant to keep him and others safe and healthy, such as not texting while driving or avoiding alcohol at parties, it’s time to have a talk with him. However, if his rebellion is focused on issues of personal expression, such as what music he likes or what clothes he wants to wear, you probably should avoid intervening. It’s important that teenagers have a safe space to figure out how to become adults.

, You can and should put your foot down about some things with your teenage boy: for example, alcohol and drug use, unsafe behavior such as texting while driving, and permanent body modifications. However, it’s natural for teenagers to rebel against their parents, especially in matters of taste, so allowing your teenage boy some room for individual expression will actually benefit you both.If you’re concerned about issues such as your boy being bullied by others for his expressions, have an honest talk with him. Share your concerns, but also respect his need to express himself and support non-damaging behaviors.

, Teenage boys think about sex. A lot. During and after puberty, their bodies and hormones rapidly change. Interest in sex is completely normal at this age, as is the desire to explore sexuality on his own through masturbation and pornography and with others through sexual activities. Educate your teen about responsible sexual attitudes and behaviors, such as safer sex practices, and be honest about your own feelings and rules regarding sex. Emphasize the importance of responsibility and respect for both himself and others.Allow your teenage boy his privacy. It may be uncomfortable knowing that your son masturbates or watches pornography, but as long as these activities are done responsibly and don’t interfere with his healthy daily functioning, mental health experts say they’re totally normal.
While it is often not a problem, just as with other pleasurable activities, pornography can become an addiction. Researchers note that signs of a pornography addiction include compulsive pornography viewing, escalating usage, and interference with daily activities and functioning. If you notice these signs, try talking with your son about healthy, responsible activity. If that fails, you may wish to consider seeking counseling., It’s important to be involved in your teenage boy’s life, even if sometimes it seems like he doesn’t want you to be. Try to maintain open communication with him, meet his friends, and know what he’s up to. Set firm and fair boundaries, and enforce them as calmly and consistently as possible. Yet give him the personal space he needs to be “cool” to his friends and pursue his own interests.Pay attention to his interests. While many teenage boys aren’t interested in chatting with their parents about most things, they may have areas of interest that they love to talk about. Try to engage with him when he expresses interest in something., Studies have shown that adolescents who don’t get the sleep they need don’t do as well in school and are at a higher risk for automobile accidents. Whenever possible, give your boy the opportunity to sleep between 8.5-10 hours a night.Encourage your teenage boy to stick to a schedule. It can be very tempting to stay up all night playing video games, especially on weekends, but maintaining a regular sleep cycle is key to staying in good mental and physical shape.
Maintaining an electronics curfew can also help your teen get the sleep he needs. Studies have shown that the blue light emitted by things like TVs, tablets, and cell-phones can mess with sleep cycles, so enforcing a “no screens after 10 PM” rule may help your teenage boy fall asleep and stay asleep.Excessive sleepiness, especially when your boy is getting a healthy amount of sleep, may be a sign of other health disorders or depression. If your teen’s sleep problems persist despite good habits, see a doctor.

, One of the hardest things about dealing with teenage boys is their seeming ability to inhale vast quantities of food. The teenage male body may grow between 3-4 inches in a single year, and this requires a lot of calories: roughly 3,500 calories a day during growth periods. To ensure he gets the nutrients he needs, provide your boy with plenty of high-protein, lower-carbohydrate foods and lots of fruits and vegetables."

Understand some facts about boys in school.,
Talk with the parents.,
Make learning more physical.,
Understand the importance of achievements.,
Encourage teamwork.,
Establish straightforward rules and clear consequences.",How to Deal with Boys3," Because boys’ gross motor skills develop faster than girls’ once they hit pre-school age, boys tend to be more physically active and fidgety in class than girls do. They may have greater attention problems as well. These issues cause significant distraction in the classroom, as demonstrated by the following statistics:Boys are 4-5 times more likely to be diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADGD) than girls
Boys are 30% more likely than girls to not complete high school
Boys make up ⅔ of special education students
Boys make up 85% of discipline referrals, If you notice consistent issues with your male students, talk with their parents. There may be issues going on at home, or it could be something as simple as the boy not getting enough sleep. Don't approach these conversations as punitive; instead, offer and ask for collaborative ways to help your student improve his performance and behavior.

, Boys tend to learn better by moving around and using their hands, because it harnesses their natural energy rather than forcing them to ignore it. Whenever possible, include kinesthetic and hands-on activities into classroom time.For example, using manipulatives (usually hands-on physical objects) in math instruction has been demonstrated to increase students’ understanding of math concepts.Designing and building models, moving or clapping to the rhythm while learning poems, and participating in acting out scenes for history, English, or theatre classes can also be helpful in directing boys’ physical movement toward learning.

, Boys are usually taught that competitiveness is a positive thing, and they often experience more “achievement stressors” (elements that cause stress because of the pressure they cause) than girls do. (Girls tend to experience more interpersonal stressors.) Because of this pressure to compete and achieve, boys are more likely to act out in class in the hopes of impressing their peers.Leverage that need to compete into academic performance by framing classroom etiquette as an achievement.


Structuring your lessons as games with levels and achievements may also help engage your male students.<ref.http://www.teachthought.com/teaching/6-strategies-engaging-boys-classroom/</ref>
Behaviors such as defiance and lack of engagement may also be a way for boys to assert their masculinity.Many societies privilege these behaviors in adult males, so boys may feel as though they need to misbehave in order to seem more like “men.” Help them understand that things like engaging in class and acting well with others don’t threaten their still-emerging masculinity.

, While boys are generally highly competitive and out to show off for their peers, they should also learn the importance of collaboration as well as competition. Including team or group activities in your lesson plans will help encourage your male students to learn the value of teamwork -- and that playing as a team doesn’t have to be limited to the sports field.

, Boys of all ages tend to be more easily distracted than girls. Teenagers in particular have a difficult time thinking about long-term consequences and may experience problems with impulse control. In addition, cultural and social conditioning may encourage them to disregard authority, especially female authority -- a difficulty compounded by the fact that there are far more female than male school-teachers. Set clear expectations for behavior and establish clear consequences for what happens when those expectations are not met.


Try to keep your expectations reasonable. For example, if you have a boy in class who can’t stop fidgeting, give him some space as long as it is not distracting to other students in your class.

Have faith.",How to Deal with Stubborn Children," No one actually knows from where or from whom they pick up the ""skill"" of being stubborn and the value it brings to them. And another fact is that many of us were stubborn when as children. When the maturity within grows, most people get to thinking and realizing that stubbornness is not all good and not all bad. Indeed, it can turn into determination and tenacity if channeled well.;
, Most likely they won't listen to you at all––it takes a few attempts before you can really get the children to stop being stubborn and to start listening to you. If you realize that children become stubborn mainly when they want something they desire badly that is not given or taken away from them. That includes food, toys or a trip out. If their wish is fulfilled they get no reason to be stubborn. But, it is not always easy or even appropriate to fulfill children's needs or to give in to their demands.

, Ask them for reasons or why you should comply that special request by them. Make them think to help them to calm down. Treat the child like an adult or your peer and give them a chance to explain themselves or their needs. If they can really think of the reasons and you can't avoid further, try to negotiate with them.

, Many adults believe that children can't be brought into a successful negotiation. but the truth is they can actually be brought into it. When you tone down your voice, keep a sad face and start explaining to them, you can notice that they do pity you and agree to agree with you.

, Never raise your voice or use violence to a stubborn child. They tend to get more aggressive and would imitate you instead of cooling down.

, Children would become silent and under control if they are scared of someone or something. If your kid is scared of the mom or dad, or any specific uncle or aunt, then you can use their names to make a temporary relief. But never scare them about ghosts or neighbors, since that would become long term phobia or cause some misunderstanding between your neighbors. Children are very straightforward. Threatening them on the scariest uncle or aunt won't last long since children nowadays are brilliantly attuned to what's realistic. After sometime they would go back to the same issue and make you scream again. So, always look for permanent solutions rather than temporary stops.

, Another trick to be played when children get stubborn is to ignore them or to pretend nothing is happening. Try to concentrate on your own chores or keep watching television, and after a while your child would be tired of crying or shouting and automatically starts to do other stuff.

, Divert the child's attention by offering a ride to the park or just for a window shopping. Ninety nine percent (give or take a few) of children love sightseeing and going out. If you are not busy or have possibilities to go out of home, take your kid out.

, You may counteroffer your children to buy them something if they stop demanding or stop being stubborn. From something as simple as an ice cream, you can win the deal when it comes to children. Understand them and be a kid at heart to know them better.

, Believe that your children will be okay soon because their very responsible, successful and super duper mom and dad used to be stubborn too when they were children.

Don't panic or stress.",How to Potty Train a Blind or Visually Impaired Toddler," If your toddler can understand the difference between a wet and dry diaper, they might be ready for potty training. Your toddler might pull off their wet diaper and may even ask you to change their soiled diaper.When your toddler recognizes their diaper is dirty, they may remove it themselves, touch it with their pants on, or they may seem or look uncomfortable.This is a big point that your toddler understands the difference between wet and dry.;
, Your toddler may start showing an interest around toilets or bathrooms. They might want to follow you as you enter the bathroom, observe and explore the sink or toilet, and try going in the bathroom on their own to explore for themselves.Your toddler may also start asking you questions such as: What do you do in the bathroom?
What is the toilet for?
Why do people enter the bathroom?
What is the bathroom for?

, Your toddler should be able to stand and get on a step stool independently and should be able to already grasp basic motor skills such as turning the pages in a book, stacking blocks, and rolling balls.If your child already has good motor skills, it might be time to start potty training since they'll be using a lot of motor skills when they're using the potty such as pulling their paints up, going on a step stool, flushing the toilet, putting the sink on, getting toilet paper, etc., If you start to notice your toddler's diaper being dry during nap time or playtime hours during the day, this is a good sign your child has control of their bladder. You may want to consider potty training during this time since your toddler has the ability to control their bladder., If your toddler is able to communicate slightly using words or signs, this might help as they start potty training. Your toddler will be able to communicate when they need to go potty by using their language skills. If your toddler is a late bloomer when it comes to communication or social skills, and you fail to understand your toddler at times, you may want to consider starting potty training a little later until they're able to communicate more clearly., Before you begin potty training, look for a potty that's comfortable and sturdy. The potty should be comfortable to sit on and should not cause pain or discomfort. It may help to find a potty that has a foam bottom to keep it soft and comfy for your toddler.The potty should also not wobble around if sat on; it should be sturdy and firm. You'll also want to find a good-quality step stool for your toddler to reach the sink when it's time to wash their hands.

, Before your toddler begins to learn what the potty is for, allow them to explore it by touching it and feeling it with their hands. Speak to them while they're exploring the potty by telling them what they are feeling. Examples include:


""You are touching the bottom part of the potty where we sit on, Nick.""
""This is the inside of the potty where all the pee and poo go in.""
""That's the lid of the potty, Jasmine. You can close the potty using the lid. Would you like to try? Close it like this.""

, While your toddler explores the potty, explain what the potty is for. Explain this is the place where they will go pee and poo, and that they won't be using their diapers. For example, you could say, ""Since you're a big boy now, you'll use the potty to pee and poop instead of your diaper. You'll call me when you need to use the potty."" Ensure your toddler understands what the potty will be for and that they will be using it when they feel the urge to go potty.

, This makes it easier for them to independently use the potty, and also makes it easy with their visual disability. Avoid letting them wear pants with zippers and buttons as these are hard to open and close. Find underwear that is comfy and slightly loose for comfort and ease towards your toddler.Avoid having them wear diapers or training pants during the day. This usually prevents your child from feeling the urge to use the bathroom and can stop them from feeling an accident happening., While you may be tempted to place the potty in your child's bedroom or playroom, keeping the potty in the bathroom is essential so your child can understand that this is the place where they go potty.Keep the potty in the bathroom at all times so your child can develop an understanding where they need to use the bathroom.This may be especially important for children with visual disabilities who need to know where to locate the potty reliably, even without being able to see it.

, The best way to teach your toddler how to use the potty is by guiding their hands when it comes to taking off their pants and underwear, as well as other bathroom tasks. Talk your way through as you guide their hands and show them what to do. Ensure the bathroom is adapted with their visual needs, too. You may need to increase the lighting, create color contrasts, reduce glare, and prevent certain bathroom hazards.Teach your toddler how to wipe and flush the toilet, if they're using the adult toilet. Guide your toddler's hands and explain what their doing and what's going on (e.g. ""Right now we're going to flush the toilet. The pee is going to go down the toilet. There we go. Did you hear the toilet? You flushed it."")
Teach your toddler how to wash their hands. Try to use a soap dish or container that contrasts with the sink or countertop so your toddler can easily see it. Keep the soap and towel in the same place at all times so your child can locate them easily without any trouble. , Your toddler make be nervous or frightened around the potty, especially because they're not able to see clearly what's going on. They might be afraid of the inside the toilet, afraid of the noises the toilet or sink make, etc. Address these fears and talk to your child about them, helping them cope and deal with these feelings. Examples:


""I've noticed you start to look startled when you flush the toilet. Would it help to cover your ears right away once you flush?""
""The sink makes a loud sound since water is gushing out. Would you like to lower the amount of water coming out?""

, When your child starts to wobble and shake (also called the ""potty dance""), hold onto their pants, and make an uncomfortable look, they probably need the potty. If you recognize these signs, ask your toddler if they have to go potty. If they do, take them right away to the potty. , Instruct your toddler to tell you when they have to go potty, whether it's using their words or making a sign, whatever is easiest for them. Explain to your child when they might need to go potty by explaining the ""feeling"" near their abdomen. You might say:


""Mohammad, when you feel a funny feeling right here, you might need to go potty. Tell me right away when you feel like you need to go and I'll take you to the potty.""
""Whenever you find yourself doing the potty dance, Caroline, make a sign for potty and I'll take you.""
""If you feel uncomfortable right here, you probably have to go potty, Jason. Tell me right away when you do.""

, During the day, allow your toddler to sit on the potty for short periods of a time, usually about 10-15 minutes. This encourages them to use the potty, prevents accidents, and allows them to get used to and comfortable with the potty.If your child is too bouncy and wants to leave the potty early, try to distract them. Read them books, sing songs, and hand them toys or stuffed animals so they can play.

, Accidents are normal and will happen, whether your child is sighted or not. When you notice an accident or if your toddler mentions it to you, explain how your child feels and what's happened. When your child changes their underwear and pants, explain how good it feels to be dry and clean. Then provide further direction on how to use the potty in the future (e.g ""When you feel a funny feeling right here, tell me, and I'll bring you to the potty.""). Some examples of what you could say to your toddler when they have an accident include:""Uh uh, your pants and underwear are wet, Chloe. You've had an accident. You probably want to change. Let's go change into nice, clean clothes.""
""Oh, why are your pants wet? Have you had an accident? You probably feel disappointed! Let's go change into dry clothes.""
""Oh no, your underwear is wet! Have you had an accident, Steven? That's okay, let's go change into clean, dry clothes. You probably feel uncomfortable in wet underwear.""

, When your toddler successfully uses the potty, celebrate and exclaim how great that is. Provide plenty of praise when they've used the potty; it'll encourage them to use it again and keep it up. Some examples you could say:


""Great job, Katie, you did it! You used the potty! I knew you could do it.""
""You did it, Greg, you used the potty all by yourself!""
""Zara, you peed in the potty! Nice job!""

, Your toddler may be a late bloomer when it comes to potty training, and may have a lot of accidents, especially with their visual disability. Know that this is okay and your toddler will get the hang of it with more time and practice. Stick with it and keep trying, but avoid scolding your toddler. This can cause fear towards them when it comes to potty training, and will end up making them learn even later out of fear., While your toddler stays on the potty you can sing songs, tell poems, and make up rhymes about using the potty to encourage your child to stay on the potty and encourage them to use it as well, making the process more enjoyable.

, While your toddler sits on the potty, read stories of children with visual impairments or normal toddlers using the potty, too. This encourages your toddler to use the potty and helps them understand they're not alone. While they may not see the pictures of the story because of their visual disability, they'll still enjoy the fun of storytelling while you read the story. It can also distract them if they're too bouncy and want to get off the potty too early., Playing games to encourage your child to use the potty makes the process more fun and easier for both you and your toddler. You can role-play with toys to demonstrate and teach your toddler to use the potty. While your child sits on the potty, you can provide a tray of toys and coloring pages so they can get distracted while they sit on the potty.

, When your toddler successfully uses the potty, you may want to provide small rewards. This encourages them to keep using potty and will prevent accidents. Some small rewards you may consider for your toddler:



Small, mini toys. You may offer tiny plastic cars, small yarn dolls, mini-sized bouncy balls, etc.

Candy. Some parents are wary of giving out candy when their toddler does something good due the negative effects of candy, but others find it a good reward. Stickers. If your toddler is visually impaired, use colorful, jumbo stickers so they're able to see the stickers more vividly.

, When your toddler successfully uses the potty, be sure to tell others in the household. You can cheerfully say, ""Guess what Avery did today?"" when their other parent comes home and then state the news. Be sure your toddler hears you clearly when you tell others the news. This encourages them to keep using the potty and to keep trying.

, Throughout the day, allow your child to drink plenty of liquids such as fruit juice, milk, or water. This can help them use the bathroom more often, which allows more training so they can have a chance to practice using the potty. Your toddler may also like:Fruit juice popsicles
Ice lollies
Milkshakes
Smoothies
Slushies
Shaved ice
Flavored ice cubes

, Throughout the day, allow your toddler to wear underwear so they're able to feel the wetness of the urine if they have an accident. During the night, consider wearing training plants in case they do have an accident while they sleep. Potty training at night is possible, but it's best to focus on training during the day until they're more experienced, to make it both easier and less complicated for you and your toddler. , Your toddler's doctor and visual therapist may have more advice and tips to help your toddler with potty training. They may suggest different methods, ideas, and products to make the training easier while suiting your toddler's visual needs, as well as answer any questions or concerns you might have about your toddler's training.

, Your toddler may take longer than a normal toddler would because of their visual impairment, and that's okay. They may have more accidents and it will take lots of time, patience, and lots of encouragement. Your toddler will get there, don't stress!

Determine healthy protein sizes.,
Give your child healthy dairy products.,
Offer a variety of vegetables.,
Give your toddler fruits.,
Determine healthy grain sizes.,
Include healthy fats.,
Limit the amount of milk your two year old drinks.",How to Determine Toddler Serving Sizes1," You can give your toddler healthy protein from a variety of sources. Meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and tofu all count towards your child's daily protein intake. One year olds need 2 ounces of protein. Two year olds need 3 ounces and three year olds need 4 ounces a day. To get one ounce of protein, give your toddler one of these:1 ounce of lean meat, poultry, or seafood.
1 egg.
1 tablespoon of peanut butter.
1/4 cup of cooked beans or peas.
1/2 ounce of nuts or seeds.;
, As your toddler gets older, they'll probably drink more milk which is an easy way to give them dairy. Most one year olds should get about 2 cups (a cup is 8oz) of dairy products a day, while two and three year olds need 2 1/2 cups a day. To give one cup of dairy, offer one of these:1 cup of milk.
1 cup of yogurt.
1 cup of fortified soy beverage.
1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese.
2 ounces of processed cheese.

, You might find that your toddler only likes to eat roasted vegetables or drink vegetable juice. Offer vegetables in different ways and of different colors until you find what your toddler likes. One year olds need 1 cup of vegetables a day, while 2 to 3 year olds need 1 1/2 cups a day. To give one cup of vegetables, offer one of these:1 cup of raw or cooked vegetables.
2 cups of leafy salad greens (like lettuce or spinach).
1 cup of 100% vegetable juice.

, Toddlers usually love the sweet taste of fruits and have little trouble eating their daily recommended amount. For one or two year olds eating a 1,000 to 1,200 calorie diet, give 1 cup of fruit a day (fresh fruits are the best choice). For three year olds or toddlers eating a 1,400 calorie diet, offer 1 1/2 cups a day. To give one cup of fruit a day, offer one of these:1 cup of fresh or cooked fruit (like 1 medium banana or 1 small apple).
1/2 cup of dried fruit (like raisins, cranberries, or dried apple).
1 cup of 100% fruit juice.

, Most of your toddler's grains should still be whole. Offer brown rice, whole grain breads, potatoes, cereals, and wheat pastas. A one year old should get about 3 ounces of grains a day. A two year old should have about 4 ounces a day and a three year old needs around 5 ounces a day. To give your toddler one ounce of grains, offer one of these:1 slice of bread.
1 ounce of ready-to-eat dry cereal (about 1 cup).
1/2 cup of cooked rice, pasta, or cereal.
1 ""mini"" bagel.
1 small tortilla (6 inches in diameter).
1 pancake (4½ inches in diameter).

, Before your toddler turns two, they should be getting about half of their daily calories from fat. If your toddler is getting around 1,000 calories, this means that 500 of them should have good sources of fat. For example, you could give:Full-fat yogurt and milk.
Nut butters.
Avocados.
Hummus.

, By age 2, your toddler should be drinking whole milk out of a cup. Your toddler should drink about 16 ounces (473 ml) of milk a day. Avoid giving more than 32 ounces (946 ml) a day since this may prevent your toddler from absorbing iron and may reduce their appetite for other healthy foods.Consider giving your toddler a vitamin D supplement if your toddler doesn't get much sunshine and drinks less than 32 ounces of milk a day. 400 IU of vitamin D can prevent your toddler from getting rickets.

Determine your toddler's calorie needs.,
Follow your child's lead when portioning food.,
Offer food that is easy and safe to eat.,
Give several meals and snacks a day.,
Offer a variety of healthy food choices.",How to Determine Toddler Serving Sizes2," Work with your child's pediatrician to find out how many calories they should get every day. Your child needs about 40 calories for every inch of height every day. For example, if your toddler is 28 inches tall, they'll need 1,120 calories every day. Try to give your one year old at least 1,000 calories a day.In general, your toddler needs this many calories a day:


One year old: 1,000 calories.Two years old: 1,000 calories.
Three years old: 1,200 to 1,400 for boys or 1,000 to 1,400 for girls., Remind yourself that toddlers are developing eating behaviors. Your toddler may clean their plate one night, but barely pick at it the next night. Avoid forcing your toddler to eat everything or foods that they don't like. Instead, continue to offer more of the foods that they do want to eat at that meal.


As long as you offer a variety of healthy foods, your child's diet will balance out over several days.

, Feed your toddler soft food or food that's cut into small bites. This will prevent your toddler from choking on food that they don't chew well. For example, cut carrots into quarters lengthwise and then sliced into small pieces, and cut grapes in half or in quarters. Avoid offering marshmallows or small nuts which could become stuck in your child's throat.You can also mash food to make it easier to eat, especially if your toddler is very young.
Never let your toddler eat food and run around. You should always supervise meal and snack times.

, Young toddlers (one year olds) may prefer to snack throughout the day, especially if they're still getting nutrition from breast milk. By the time your toddler is two or three, you should be giving them three meals a day and at least a snack or two. Don't expect your child to eat all the food you set out throughout the day, but always offer the food.You may want to leave the snacks out so your toddler knows there's food available if they become hungry.

, Toddler are still developing their sense of taste, so don't be surprised if your toddler says that something is too spicy or doesn't taste good. Flavors may seem stronger to small children. Instead of forcing them to eat foods they dislike, give them lots of options at each meal.Remind yourself that your toddler will eat when they're hungry. When they do, ensure you're giving healthy snacks or meals.

Find a chewable item.,
Choose a string or chain.,
Attach the item.,
Adjust the length.",How to Make Stim Toys1," Check that the material it is made of is non-toxic and won't break up when chewed. Choose an item that is small and lightweight enough to be used as jewelry. If the toy is for a child, be sure that the item is not small enough to be swallowed. Many types of rubber, plastic, and stones like amber can be safely chewed.;
, There are many types of string, ribbon, and chain that can be used as jewelry. When choosing a holder, check that it is non-toxic and will not fray or break when chewed. The texture of the holder is just as important as the chewable object. Some people might prefer a silky ribbon, while others will want a clunky chain. Feel free to test out different materials.

, You can attach the item by drilling a small hole and threading the string or chain through it. You can also use a wire cage hanging from a necklace or bracelet to have an easily removable chewable. Another option is to use a knotting method to form a tiny net around your object.

, Decide whether you want a necklace, bracelet, anklet, or some other item. If you are using chain, you will need to learn how to change the length of a jewelry chain and how to add clasps to the ends. If you are using string or ribbon, you can simply cut the ends to the length you want and then tie them together using a square knot.

Prepare the case.,
Prepare your decorations.,
Start gluing.,
Dry and use.",How to Make Stim Toys2," There are plenty of phone cases and plastic decorative items available online, at craft stores, and in other locations. Choose a hard, solid-colored or clear case. For decorations, choose items that have interesting textures and appearances. You can find tiny velvet animals, mini mirrors, fabric patches, and anything else that is small enough to fit on a phone case. Since this is on your phone, you probably will not be chewing it, so don't worry about paint or small parts.

, You can lay down newspaper, printer paper, saran wrap, or any other material that will prevent glue from getting on your table.

, You should have a hard plastic phone case that is not flexible. To remove any dust or fingerprints, wipe the phone case with rubbing alcohol. You can use cotton balls dampened with rubbing alcohol or premade alcohol wipes. After this, leave the case flat on the table and do not touch it with your skin.

, You can find your own decorations or buy decoden cabochons online that are made just for phone cases. Wipe the backs of the decorations with rubbing alcohol to clean them, and then place them on the phone case without glue to plan where you want them to stay.

, There are many types of glue available for plastic, and they come in several colors. Some choices include Fuwa Fuwa, Whipple Decorating Creme, E6000 Craft Adhesive, and others. If you have a latex allergy or similar condition, check the glue ingredients before using. Once you are ready, add the decorative pieces to the back of your phone case.

, Check the glue instructions for drying time. When your case is done drying, put it on your phone and enjoy a convenient tactile toy!

Gather clear elastic cord, glue, and beads of various sizes and shapes.,
Begin stringing beads along the cord.,
Tie the elastic once or twice.,
Glue the knot once the bracelet is the correct size.,
Clip off the ends of the string once the glue is dry.,
To stim, place the bracelet around one thumb and loosely close your fist around it.",How to Make Stim Toys3," Plastic beads are cheap and simple, while glass beads look fancier and can be worn to work.


Ensure that the glue is clear and does not shatter easily. Two-part epoxy glue (which you mix by hand) or E-6000 work best for this., It helps to alternate between one large bead and one small bead. Try round beads to make them comfortable to spin in your hands.

, Then slip the bracelet on and off your wrist. Is it comfortable? Do you need to make it larger or smaller?


The knot may try to undo itself as you take the bracelet on or off. If this happens, ask a friend to pull the knot tight as you try it on.

, Place your bracelet on some cardboard, tagboard, or old newspaper. Pull the cord as tight as you can, then glue it. Apply plenty of glue to help it stay. Let it sit to dry as long as the instructions suggest.


Some glues, such as E-6000, involve fumes. Try gluing the bracelet outside. (When it is dry, the fumes will be gone and it will be safe.)
If your beads are translucent, try not to get glue inside the beads, as it may make them less shiny. A thicker glue will be easier to keep out of the center of the beads.

, If you applied lots of glue, you should be able to cut it very close and trim off any pointy bits so that it is smooth.

, With your other hand, pull the bracelet so it spins through your hand. You can also wave it around, run your fingers over it, or experiment with new ways to stim.

Get a balloon and some flour.,
Open the neck of the balloon.,
Spoon flour into the balloon.,
Stop when the balloon is at a medium size.,
Tie the neck of the balloon shut.,
Squeeze the balloon.",How to Make Stim Toys4," Any type of flour works for this purpose, but use a typical balloon rather than a water balloon, as water balloons are thinner and more susceptible to popping.


Don't get a cheap balloon, as these will pop easily. You may even want to put one balloon inside of another balloon before filling it, as a precaution.
If you have an allergy to latex, use latex-free balloons.

, You can use your fingers to gently widen the neck of the balloon.

, Take a small spoon and begin adding flour into the balloon. Be cautious to avoid spilling flour all over your workspace.

, The balloon should be full enough so that there's minimal air, but not full enough that it's impossible to change its form using your hands. If it's firm to the touch, it's too full, and you run the risk of it bursting and making a mess everywhere when you squeeze it.

, Stretch out the neck of the balloon, then knot it by creating a loop and slipping the end of the neck through the loop. Make sure not to flip the balloon in a way that causes the flour to spill out.


If you've ""double-bagged"" the balloons, be sure to tie both of the balloons, not just one. Tuck the innermost knot into the second balloon, and then knot the outermost balloon.

, You can knead the balloon with your hands and move the flour around inside of the balloon. Just be careful not to squeeze all the flour to one end of the balloon, or it might pop!

Pour the boiling water into the jar.,
Add a few drops of any desired color food coloring.,
Shake in the glitter.,

Close the lid tightly.,
Shake the jar.",How to Make Stim Toys5," Have enough water to almost fill the jar, and enough food coloring and glitter to fill the water. Be prepared to use the stove, as well, since you need to boil the water.


You can also add some lightweight decorations, such as metallic confetti, to the glitter jar. This can add some extra sparkles when you shake the jar.
If you or the recipient has poor coordination, this may not be the best choice for a stim toy, as a glass jar will break if dropped, and the hot water required in the project may melt a plastic jar.

, You can do this using a pot or a teakettle.

, Use caution - use potholders or oven mitts when handling the pot or kettle, and keep a distance from the pot or kettle and the water so that you don't risk burning yourself or splashing hot water on you.

, When adding in the food coloring, take care that you add enough to get the color of water that you want.

, Grab the glitter and glitter glue, and add it into the hot water. Use a spoon to stir it thoroughly.

, If you're putting any other decorations (i.e small plastic toys, glow sticks, seashells, etc.) into your glitter jar, put them in the glitter water.

, Put extra force into making sure the lid is closed. You can also glue the lid shut if you don't plan on reopening the jar at any point.

, To stim with the toy, shake the jar and watch the glitter swirl around. It's a very calming visual effect used by many people!

Check with local organizations.",How to Choose Summer Childcare1," Summer childcare and summer camps fill up quickly, so it's important to start looking early. You can start looking as early as January for the summer. In fact, it wouldn't hurt to start earlier if you know places fill up fast in your area., Many agencies can help you find childcare in the summer, and you likely have an agency nearby. One network of agencies is called the Child Care Resources and Referral network. You can call and ask questions, or you can use their online database to help you find childcare.You can call Child Care Aware at 1(800) 424-2246 to be connected to a local resource agency.

, If you're a parent, you likely know other parents with kids the same age who are in the same boat. Ask around to see where other parents are sending their kids for the summer. You may find a place you hadn't considered before., Many kid-focused organizations offer either daycare or summer camps for kids. For instance, organizations like the Y.M.C.A., the Girl Scouts, the Boy Scouts, and the Boys and Girls Club all offer summer programs that may be a good fit for your kids. Other places you might look include park and rec departments and schools."

Look at the fees and what's included.,
Look at the adult-to-child ratio.,
Discuss the staff.,
Check for licensing and accreditation.,
Consider location.,
Visit in person.",How to Choose Summer Childcare2," Of course, price shouldn't be the only consideration when choosing childcare. However, you do need to be able to afford it. Check your budget, and decide what you can pay comfortably. When you're looking at daycares and camps, check to see what's included, so you don't have surprise expenses. For instance, some programs include meals and excursions in the tuition while others don't include them., When picking a childcare, it's essential to see how many adults they have caring for the children. Children as young as four do okay in a ratio of ten kids to a single adult, but babies need at least one adult for every four babies.Pay attention to how the kids are grouped. Even if the adult-to-child ratio is good, large groups can be more chaotic than smaller groups.

, When assessing a childcare program, it's important to ask about the staff. You can ask what kind of qualifications they have, for instance, as some daycares have staff with child development training.Also ask about turnover. Stability is important for your children. Also, high turnover can show an issue with the program.

, State licensing makes sure the daycare provides a minimal amount of care. If you want to make sure your daycare is held to a higher standard, look for accreditation from organizations such as the National Association for Family Child Care (NAFCC) and the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).For summer camps, accreditation is a bit different. While not every high-quality camp is accredited, almost all accredited camps are high quality. Talk to a representative from the camp to see if they are accredited by the American Camp Association.If the camp isn't accredited, that doesn't automatically mean it's terrible. However, you should do more investigating before deciding on that camp.

, Childcare needs to be somewhat convenient for you. If you have to drive 30 minutes each way to pick up and drop off your child, you're likely not going to be happy about it. Plus, you're more likely to run late or have issues being to the daycare or your work on time., Whatever kind of childcare you decide on, from in-home childcare and childcare centers to a summer camp, go to the facility in person before making a decision. Look for things like appropriate supervision, cleanliness, and safety."
"
Check for a scholarship program.,
Consider the camp's history.,
Incorporate your kids' interests.,
Ask about the spirit of the camp.,
Decide if your child is ready for a co-ed camp.",How to Choose Summer Childcare3," It's a good idea to check if a camp has a scholarship program even if you don't need it. A scholarship program indicates the camp focuses on being inclusive and creating community., While longevity isn't everything, it does say something about how the camp is run. That is, a camp wouldn't have stayed in business for years if it had major issues. Longevity can be a plus., Many day camps have a particular focus, such as academics, sports, art, or music. Picking one that focuses on something your kid loves will keep them happier, making you happier in turn.Other camps may focus on several activities. That's fine, as long as they give kids some choice in what they want to do.

, That is, each camp has its own personality, and your kid needs to mesh with that. Some camps encourage competition, while others focus more on community building, for instance. Talk to a representative from the camp to see what philosophy they follow., Some camps are all-boys or all-girls, while other camps are co-ed. Really, the decision is up to you about what you think is best for your child, but each type of camp will have a different environment."

Protect your kids from mosquitoes carrying Zika virus.,
Choose a repellent that protects from mosquitoes carrying West Nile Virus.,
Pick a repellent that prevents tick bites.,
Use a repellent with picaridin for children with allergies.,
Limit your use of products with DEET.,
Avoid using insect repellents on babies under 2 months old.,
Consider using an herbal non-toxic insect repellent.",How to Choose an Insect Repellent for Kids1," If your children live in or will be travelling to a region affected by the Zika virus, choose an insect repellent that will protect against mosquitoes. Look for a product that contains one of these ingredients and choose a higher concentration of the repellent if your child will be outdoors for a long time:Picaridin (20%)
IR3535 (20%)
DEET (7% to 30%);
, Since insect repellents that protect against mosquitoes contain similar ingredients, you could use the same repellent to protect against Zika virus and West Nile Virus. If you're choosing a repellent specifically against mosquitoes carrying West Nile Virus, you could choose products with a lower percentage of Picaridin and DEET. You could also use a botanical repellent, oil of lemon eucalyptus (30 to 40%).If your child is under 3 years old, avoid using repellents that contain oil of lemon eucalyptus.

, If your kids will be in a forested area that may be home to ticks carrying Lyme disease, you can apply a repellent that contains Picaridin (20%), IR3535 (20%), oil of lemon eucalyptus (30 to 40%), or DEET (20% to 30%).Remember not use use oil of lemon eucalyptus on children under 3 years old.

, If your child has sensitive skin or allergies, try an insect repellent that contains Picaridin (5% to 20%). It is effective at repelling insects (especially mosquitoes) for a long period of time and it won't irritate your kids' skin or eyes. Choose a lower concentration if your kids won't be outdoors for very long.Always test the repellent on a small patch of skin before applying it all over.

, DEET is in a lot of insect repellents to protect against mosquitoes and ticks. While DEET is safe for kids to use in the short term, avoid using insect repellents with DEET every day since it may cause neurological problems (like dizziness, headaches, and trouble concentrating). You shouldn't apply DEET more than once a day.Consider using products that contain IR5353. It acts similar to DEET, but has fewer side effects.

, If your child is under 2 months old, avoid using any insect repellent on them. Instead, place a fine netting over your baby's stroller or baby carrier when you're outside to protect them from insects.Products containing Picaridin, DEET, and IR5353 are safe for babies over 2 months old. Wait to use oil of lemon eucalyptus until your child is over three years old.

, If you'd like to avoid commercial insect repellents, ask your child's pediatrician to recommend an herbal insect repellent. Neem oil is commonly used in insect repellents that are marketed as natural. Researchers are unsure if neem oil is effective in areas where viral diseases like West Nile and Zika are widespread.You may want only want to use products with neem oil to protect against common insect bites.

Test a repellent.,
Rub insect repellent on your child's skin.,
Apply the product outdoors.,
Apply a stick or lotion.,
Talk with your child's doctor if you suspect a reaction.",How to Choose an Insect Repellent for Kids2," Before you apply insect repellent all over your kids' skin, rub just a little over a small patch of skin. Watch the skin for any irritation. Avoid applying the repellent if you notice:Redness or rash
Blisters
Hives

, Squirt some of the insect repellent into the palms of your hands. Rub your hands onto your child's skin. Don't apply it near the mouth, eyes, or hands (since kids often put their hands in their mouths). Only apply a little repellent near their ears.Don't let your kids put their own insect repellent on since they may accidentally get it in their eyes or mouths.
Avoid applying insect repellent to cuts or irritated skin.

, If you're using an insect repellent spray, ensure that you apply it in a well-ventilated space (like outside) and avoid spraying near the mouth. This will reduce the risk that your kids will breathe in the repellent.You may want to avoid using repellent sprays on small children since it will be harder to stop them from breathing in the spray as you apply it.

, If you're using insect repellent on younger children, you may want to apply an insect repellent lotion or rub an insect repellent stick on their skin. These will give you more control in applying the repellent.


You may want to give the child something to look at or play with while you apply the lotion. This can distract them long enough for you to apply the repellent.

, If your child has skin or eye irritation, stop using the insect repellent. Talk with your child's doctor about a safer alternative to repellents. IR5353 and DEET can cause mild irritation. If you think your child is having an allergic reaction to oil of lemon eucalyptus (hives, swelling, rash), stop using the repellent immediately and contact the doctor.

Take one day at a time.,
Learn how to advocate for your child.,
See a therapist.",How to Love Your Blind or Visually Impaired Child," Choose toys that are interesting for a blind child, such as toys that make noise and have different textures. Blind children can learn fundamentals like cause and effect through touch and sound, so let them explore things through touch.Look for toys that have a lot of moving parts, textures, and sounds to appeal to their senses of touch and sound.

Choose sturdy toys that don’t have small parts so that they won’t break and become hazardous for your child. Small parts can easily become a choking hazard. You also want to avoid sharp edges.
Look for toys that allow your child to push, pull, and wiggle parts of it. An example of a good toy would be a soft, plush toy that is squishy and squeaks when squeezed.
Look for cardboard books that have textures on each page so that your child can flip through it and feel the textures.
Remember that your child can play with toys and enjoy them like any other child. Take joy in their play.;
, Children often feel frustrated by their own limitations and external rules, and blind children may feel this more. Young children have difficulty expressing themselves, but blind children may feel more frustrated. Validate your child’s feelings and label their emotions.For example, say, “Oh sweetie, I see you’re disappointed I didn’t let you wear that as a hat” or, “I can tell you are upset, but it is not okay to hit other children.”
If you have difficulty responding to your child’s frustration, take a moment before responding or intervening. Calm yourself by deeply breathing.

, Arrange a designated, safe special place for your child to play. This designated area could be wherever you see fit in your home, such as a corner in the kitchen, the center of the living room, their bedroom, or a playroom. Allow enough space for you to spread the toys out enough so that your child can reach out and feel to search for them.

Encourage your child to use their motor skills to crawl, scoot, or walk to toys of interest.
If you don’t want to leave the toys spread out, you could arrange organized boxes or bins with toys for your child to reach into and grab. Make sure your bins or containers are sturdy and don’t slide or roll when your child tries to get the toys out.
Keep the bins in the same spot so that your child is able to learn to put away their own toys.
If your child knows how to read braille, label the bins with the contents printed in braille. You can write in braille using a braille marker.

, Spend time each day engaging in child-directed play. This means following your child’s lead and letting them choose the activities. Instead of offering suggestions of what to do or how to do it, ask your child. This helps you connect with your child and give them your attention. This can help you connect and appreciate your child in a happy state of play.Say, “Where are the dolls going?” or, “What are we building with the blocks?”

, Help your child learn where the toys are and what is available for them. Show your child how individual toys work and how to play with them. When your child starts to play with a toy, explain to them what they are feeling and how it works.

Place your hand over your child’s as they feel the toy. Tell them what they are feeling. For example, say, “When you press here it makes the sound you hear,” or “This page of the book is soft, but this page of the book is rough.” This is especially important if the toy is new and unfamiliar to your child.
You can also allow your child to play with safe household items, which will allow you to teach them practical life-skills through play. For example, give your child pots and pans to play with. As they bang on the pots and pans, you can also show them how to use spoons, spatulas, or lids. Talk to them about what they’re playing with and how it’s used.

, A massage is a great way to relax and bond with your baby. It can help reduce crying, control stress, and improve sleep. Give a massage at night to soothe and relax your baby before sleep, or as a way to get your baby to take a nap. Lightly massage your baby all over their body. If they look uncomfortable, try a different location. Slowly stroke and knead their head, neck, shoulders, back, legs, feet, arms, and hands.The sensory experience of the massage can help your blind baby feel calm and relaxed.
Wait at least 45 minutes after your baby eats so that they do not vomit.

, Before identifying your child as blind or visually impaired, identify them as a child. While being blind or visually impaired is part of who they are, it does not define them as a person. They are unique in their own likes and dislikes and will create their own identity. Let them have opportunities and choose what they enjoy and do not enjoy as you would a sighted child.Blind children want to play and have fun just like any other child. Let them enjoy childhood in a similar way.
Connect with your child by playing with them and interacting with them through toys and play.

, It’s easy for parents of blind children to hover or keep their child under a watchful eye for their safety. Yet, blind children gather lots of information from their surroundings and are often more capable than people think. While it’s likely your child will experience difficulties and injuries from time to time, remember that this is true for sighted children as well.Let them explore the world instead of creating the world around them. It can be fun to see them gain their independence and be less scared.
If you feel trapped by always keeping a watchful eye on your child, accept that they will make mistakes and get hurt but will almost always be okay. Giving independence to your child can help you have more control of your own life again.

, Have special one-on-one time with your child. You might take them out for lunch or dinner or come get them from school to have some time together. Think about the activities your child enjoys and do them together. Perhaps they enjoy going to the pool or climbing trees. Whatever you do, make it special time for the two of you.Take your child to their favorite restaurant. Let them order what they want from the menu and give them your undivided attention.

, Give lots of affection including hugs, kisses, and snuggles. Run your fingers through their hair. Let your child sit in your lap or hold them. Let them know through your words and your touch how much you care about them and love them.Give affection and praise when your child does something positive, completes a task, or discovers something on their own.

, Think about the things that make your child special, great, unique, and fun. Especially when you’re feeling frustrated at your child or upset with the care required, think about all of the positive things they do. Consider their special abilities and the role they play in your family. Give thanks for who they are.

Think about how they have added to your life. Remember, the frustration doesn’t last forever.
Tell your child that you’re glad for who they are and that they are a part of the family.

, If you’re feeling frustrated or angry with your child, take a break. Kids can become scared by your anger, so if they’re pressing your buttons, take some time away or calm yourself. Model to your child how to handle difficult emotions.If you’re upset, take some deep breaths before speaking. If you need some more time, leave the room and come back in a bit.
If your child is angry and you’re struggling to manage your own anger, respond in a calm way by saying, “I can tell you’re upset, so let’s take a moment to cool off.”

, Connect with other parents who also have blind or visually impaired children. You may find other parents in your local community or on an online community. Knowing that you’re not alone and other parents have ‘been there’ can be comforting and reassuring.Ask for advice, get feedback, and connect with other parents who also need support.

, It’s okay to talk about your child’s difficulties. The more parents are open with frustrations and problems, the better they can communicate and work together to find solutions. Lean on your family and friends for support.It’s okay if you’re not “strong” for your child or for your partner or other parent. If you need to express yourself, do it. It’s okay to admit that raising a blind child is difficult.

, Finding out your child is different can be difficult, and it may take some time to accept these differences. You might feel disappointed, sad, confused or even guilty. It’s easy to get lost in thought about how your child will grow up and the hardships they my face. Instead of focusing on the potential negatives of the future, focus on your child as they are now. Let go of the “what if’s” and focus on what your child is doing currently.There are positives in each and every day. Focus less on what’s difficult and more on what makes your child unique and special to you.
Celebrate all of the things your child can do, like laugh and smile and crawl.

, As your child’s parent, you are their primary and most important advocate. Become an expert on the supports that your child needs and what should be available to them. Start early so that your child receives the help they need throughout their lives, including in school.

Know about your child’s diagnosis and individual needs so that you can better communicate with your child’s doctors and support specialists.
Know your child’s rights under relevant legislation. For example, in the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) both guarantee that your child will receive the supports they need. Be prepared to explain that if necessary.
Talk to the people who will work with your child before enrolling them in a school or program. Discuss what they will do, as well as any concerns you have. Make sure that your child gets what they need.
Learn about the types of specialists who will be working with your child, what they focus on, and what they can or cannot do for your child. This includes their pediatric ophthalmologists, physical therapists, primary medical providers, and/or other therapists and teachers of students with visual impairments. As you meet these individuals, keep track of their names and contact information. Also keep the information of a back-up doctor that you can call in the event that your child’s primary physician is unavailable. Keep this information readily available.

, If you struggle with parenting a blind or visually impaired child and cannot seem to deal with the stress on your own, consider seeing a therapist. You can openly talk about your thoughts and feelings. A therapist can help you cope with your feelings and may also help you find resources to help you and your family. Your therapy should feel like a safe space to experience your feelings and challenges.Find a therapist through your insurance provider or local mental health clinic. You can also get a recommendation from your physician or a family or friend.

This will prevent your child from touching the computer tower and protect them from hurting themselves.As well, if you use a printer or a paper shredder, make sure it is also well out of reach of your child on a high surface. You can secure your electronics with safety straps so they are not at risk of falling and injuring your child.;
, You can find keyboard, computer, and printer covers at your local electronics store. Using covers will prevent your equipment from being damaged by spills and sticky fingers in your workspace.Try to remember to always cover your keyboard, computer, and printer before you leave the room in the event your child wanders into your home office or too close to your equipment.

, Many children are fascinated by keyboards and will press all the buttons when given the chance. Use a password to protect and lock your computer when you’re away from your desk so your files are not at risk in the event your child gets their hands on your keyboard., Make sure your drawers and cabinets are hard to access by using door stops on cabinet doors and locks on drawers. You can also put safety strips on your drawers so they are difficult for your child to open and go through.


If you have big storage units or cabinet units in your office, make sure they are secure and cannot tip over easily., Avoid shocking and choking hazards by taping any loose electrical cords to the ground with electrical tape and zip tying any extra cord lengths. You should also use safety plug covers on all your unused electrical outlets so your child’s fingers cannot get in there.


You can also buy safety covers for your power strips at your local electronics store to prevent your child from touching the power strips.

, Prevent your child from injuring themselves on sharp edges by putting safety covers on the corners of your office furniture. You can also push furniture with sharp edges against the wall so there are less hazards in the room, or remove them from the room.Consider replacing your existing furniture with items that have rounded edges instead of sharp corners, or that are made of soft material that will not pose a hazard to your child.

, Keep office supplies like tape, printer ink, and letter openers out of reach so your child cannot hurt themselves or make a mess in your office. Place all office supplies in drawers that are secured with safety stripes.You should also use a trash can with a lid so your child is deterred from looking through your garbage or putting anything from the garbage in their mouth.

, If you have a baby or a toddler, you can use safety gates to create a play area next to your office or place your child’s play pen close to your office. This will allow you to keep an eye on your child and be assured they are in a contained, safe space nearby.If you have an older child, the best way to keep them out of your office is to give them a work area of their own. Create a mini office area for them in one corner or area of your office so you can monitor them while you’re working. Place a small desk with drawers in the area so your child knows where their work space is and where your work space is. This will establish boundaries and make for a more child-friendly work space.

, Give your child an activity to focus on in their mini office area with child-friendly supplies like crayons, markers, water soluble paint, and legos. You can even set up a task for them, like making a painting or building a spaceship, so they are occupied while you are doing work., Though it may be tempting to simply ban your child from your office as a form of childproofing, this will likely only make your child more interested in your office and they may try to barge in anyway. Be open to letting your child play, interact, and hang out in your office, especially if they are older.Once you childproof your office, you should feel assured knowing your child can come in and out of your office without hurting themselves. Having an open door policy will also make the office feel like just another room of the house and over time, your child should grow more interested in playing in other rooms in the house.

Build upon previous lessons.,
Help them find mechanisms to make their life easier.,
Show confidence in them.,
Take transitions slowly, at their own pace.,
Reach out and talk to local supports or supports in the area your adult child might live.,
Have other adults help you.,
Help your child find mentors and other members of the autistic community.,
Treat your child like a friend.",How to Parent an Autistic Young Adult," Find out what their priorities are, and help them develop those skills. There may be many skill areas in which they struggle, and it will be up to the two of you to prioritize. Getting your child's input will help them feel involved and imagine what their life will be like.


For example, a young autistic woman may feel that her executive dysfunction will prevent her from taking care of herself, but she wants to improve her social skills so she can get a good job. In that case, focus your coaching on interacting with people, and don't worry about teaching her to cook or clean.;
, Assume that they will be able to do these themselves someday when they feel ready.


Offer to teach them individual tasks. For example, maybe they'd like to learn how to make scrambled eggs, or watch you do laundry.
Ask them to do one step of the task. For example, ""Would you please fold your sister's shirts?""
Narrate the step-by-step process as you go through it. ""First, we get a pan, a bowl, and a fork. Next, we crack the eggs into the bowl. Then we stir them with the fork...""
When they're ready to try it by themselves, write down a list of the steps they need to follow. Stay nearby while they follow the list.

, First your child can learn to scramble eggs, then make omelets, then start on more complex meals like spaghetti and meatballs.

, If they experience executive dysfunction, help them find a working to-do list system (e.g. ToDoIst). If they struggle with remembering to clean, suggest a robotic vacuum that cleans for them. Search the internet for solutions for various problems (and don't limit your search to autism—sometimes neurotypicals use the same coping tricks). A strong repertoire of strategies will help them become more independent.


Some of these mechanisms may be unusual, such as a cooking service or a worker who helps them get dressed. This is okay. Focus on making them be successful, not on making them be normal.

, Tell them they can do it. Review past success—anything from brushing their own teeth to writing complex computer programs.

, If and when your child says they are ready to move out, they will need plenty of support. Help them set up their new home and learn the new neighborhood. Assure them that you can visit as often as they'd like, so they don't feel that you suddenly disappeared from their lives.

, Consider health units, community services, et cetera. Help your child start setting up appointments.

, Transitioning an autistic adult to living outside of the home is no easy task, and it's certainly not one that you and the adult should try alone. Enlist your spouse (if any), your child's therapist(s) and/or social worker, and any other caregivers and mentors. Together, you can work as a team and help your child be ready for the outside world.

, These people can help your child talk through their issues, and brainstorm solutions. Meeting other autistic people (online or in person) will also help their self-esteem, and they can share tips.


Contact a volunteer organization and see if any volunteers are willing to work with your child.
Find an autism-related support group for your child to attend. (Screen it to make sure that there are no toxic influences.)
Consider starting your own group for autistic young adults!

, Listen to them, talk to them, and love them for who they are.

Eat right, get enough sleep, exercise. Yes, yes... we've heard it all before. However, an unbalanced life can heighten sensitivity, leading to irritability and overwhelm. It’s hard enough going through life with SID, and hunger or exhaustion can make the day even more challenging.;
, Children with SID often act sensitive, withdraw, or melt down when they feel overwhelmed. Set aside a corner of a room where your child can go without being disturbed. Weighted blankets, lights on a dimmer switch, white noise, and no interruptions can help your child relax and return to equilibrium. Put some books or little toys there for them to occupy themselves. When you notice that the child seems overwhelmed, ask if they want to go to their quiet place for a while.

Quiet time can also apply for strong emotions such as anger. This is NOT a ""time out"" or a punishment. In fact, positive reward works better than punishment.







, After the rough time has passed, calmly talk about it. Ask reflective questions like “what made you cry at the party?” and answer sympathetically. “Yeah, that would make me cry, too.” Just listen without judging. It is hard for a child to articulate complex, overwhelming emotions. Listening is such a simple thing, but it is incredibly powerful.

, Rather than punishment and laying down the law, figure out what went wrong and how to avoid it in the future. If the child is old enough, try to figure out a way to reduce stressful stimuli while still engaging in the outside world. Your child may come up with good solutions that you would never have thought of. Note: this takes a lot of practice.

, SI people react rather than assess the situation and act appropriately. If in an overstimulating place like the mall, or in a stressful situation, their brain gets overwhelmed and goes into panic mode. It's impossible to make good choices in that state. Create a predefined action plan to find a quiet space to calm down, and enlist the help of others if possible.

, Pay close attention to your own body and feelings. If you are at a loud restaurant or a crowded mall, there comes a time when you just have to leave for your own sanity. Likewise, pay close attention to your child, read her cues, know when she is approaching her limits. Don’t try to do too many things in one day. If your child is telling you that she needs to leave, honor that and don’t push her beyond her limits. You will be thankful!

, Decide beforehand how long to stay at a party, play-date or Grandma's house. Leave a party, a play-date, or cut short the visit to grandma’s early. Don't linger until tiredness or crankiness set in. Leave while everyone is still in a good mood. Explain to your child that you will listen and respect their wishes if they need to leave.

, Learn both your own and your child's triggers. Triggers are actions, stimuli, or behaviors that bring about an overwhelm or 'fight or flight' response. Usually it starts with being tired, hungry, or overstimulated. Then there is some minor irritation. Then another that multiplies it. Most people would feel mildly bothered. But for people with SI, it can escalate exponentially. The signals are there; they must simply be recognized and respected. Children with SID usually send verbal & nonverbal messages well before they melt down. It’s when you ignore them that you both get into trouble.

, Get up extra early to allow for the extra time to do things. It is frustrating. Take a deep breath and remember the mantra ""Love = Patience"". Also, she takes longer to process things mentally, emotionally, to form answers. Remain still and silent while waiting for her to complete her thoughts. It frustrates her when you talk too much or interrupt her.

, Sometimes children with SID cannot take multiple directions at once. Like, “Brush your teeth - use toothpaste, brush your hair, and get put on your new yellow dress.” The instructions can quickly become jumbled, lost, or blurred in her mind. Instead, tell her to brush her teeth. When she’s done, do the next thing. You just have to let her do things at her own speed - and in her own unique way.

Picture schedules can also help children remember their schedule. Knowing that the schedule will guide them relieves the pressure of trying to recall everything perfectly.







, There is no one way to do things. Come up with creative solutions. You can change course in midstream. If your daughter wants slightly change the bedtime routine, it’s okay. Go with what she wants to do sometimes. Give her a bit of control. Stop for that ice cream. You’ll end up having a lot more fun.

, There are tricks you can use to take the edge off. When you go to a loud place, bring earplugs and let your child use earphones to listen to music or white noise. Wear sunglasses and hats, outdoors or even indoors. Bring familiar foods when on vacation to avoid the stress of needing to try new things. When making spicy foods, try letting each person apply seasoning to taste, instead of making it equally spicy for everyone.

, Let your child know when he or she has done something well, even if it is something small. Parents forget that life can be challenging for the most well adapted kids. Every little victory should be acknowledged.

, If you do blow up at your kid, say you’re sorry and that you’ll try to do better next time. Calmly talk about what happened and how they felt, focusing on them. It’s good modelling for your child. You are not perfect. Assure them you love them and give them a big hug. The next time your child misbehaves, she might just come up afterwards and say “I’m sorry, Daddy,” and “I love you.” It is a golden moment, and you know you’re doing it right!

, A lot.

Determine if your child may be eligible for an IEP.,
Schedule a conference with your child’s teacher.,
Decide if you would like to have your child assessed.,
Get an IEE if you disagree with the evaluation.,
Consider other additions to your child’s IEP team.,
Attend the IEP meeting.,
Get a copy of your child’s IEP.,
Have your child reevaluated every three years.",How to Obtain an IEP for a Student1," There are several disabilities that may make your child eligible for an IEP. If your child has already been diagnosed with a disability, then you can use this diagnosis as a reason why an IEP is necessary. Some disabilities that may qualify your child for an IEP include:learning disabilities
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
emotional disorders
cognitive challenges
autism
hearing, vision, or speech impairment
developmental delays;
, To get the IEP process started, you will need to schedule a conference with your child’s teacher. During this meeting, you can express your concerns about the challenges your child has been having with school.Keep in mind that your child’s teacher may or may not be aware of your child’s struggles. You might start by saying something like, “I am not sure if you have noticed anything unusual in the classroom, but here’s what I have noticed at home…”
Your child’s teacher may also recommend a conference that includes your child, an observation of your child, and an evaluation of school work that your child has produced.

, If you have concerns about your child’s performance in school and you think he or she would benefit from an IEP, then you can request to have your child assessed. There is no cost to have your child assessed. Your child will be assessed by specialists in the school system, which may include a:psychologist
physical therapist and/or occupational therapist
speech therapist
vision or hearing specialist
special education teacher
any other specialists who may be able to evaluate your child’s needs

, You have the right to take your child for an Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE) if you do not agree with the findings of your child’s evaluation. The person who evaluates your child can request that the school system pay for the evaluation.Do not hesitate to get a second opinion if you think that the school’s assessment is incorrect. For example, if you disagree with the school’s assessment of your child’s hearing abilities, then you could take your child to a hearing specialist for a second opinion.

, You have the right to add other members to your child’s IEP planning team if you choose to do so. This may include a specialist who has worked with your child or someone who works with your child outside of school, such as a coach. You can also hire an attorney to serve as an advocate for you and your child during the IEP planning process.If you cannot afford an attorney, then the school system can provide one for you.

, All members of the IEP planning team are required to attend the IEP planning meeting. You are a member of this team, so you are entitled to attend the meeting.


Keep in mind that your input is quite valuable since your know your child best. Speak up if you disagree with something someone says or if you have ideas about what would be the most helpful measures for your child.
You have the right to have the meeting recorded if you provide written notice at least 24 hours before the meeting. You can provide this request to your child’s school principal or to the special education chairperson.Be sure to ask questions and express your concerns during the IEP meeting as well. For example, if something does not make sense to you, then you might say something like, “I am not sure that I understand what that means. Can you please clarify it for me?”

, After the IEP has been drawn up, you are entitled to receive a paper copy of the plan. Make sure that you request on if you do not receive one within a week of the meeting.


If you disagree with any aspect of the IEP, then you can also request mediation or a hearing. You can hire your own attorney for this process or ask to have one appointed to you if you cannot afford an attorney., To ensure that the IEP is providing the maximum benefit to your child, it is important for him or her to be reevaluated at least once every three years. This reevaluation will also identify whether your child still has the disability or if it has improved or become more severe.Depending on the findings of the “triennial” reevaluation, your child’s IEP may need to be adjusted.

Learn about autism.,
Read blogs dedicated to loving autistic children.,
Take a break.,
Step away from social media.,
Value your sleep.,
Get a support network.,
Let yourself experience negative emotions.,
Quit trying to be a perfect parent.",How to Love Your Autistic Child1," It's helpful to understand why your child is different. Research as much as you are able, so that you have a better understanding of the differences in your child's mind.


Be careful about your sources. Groups like Autism Speaks may use fearmongering and talk about how having an autistic child will ruin your life. This is false.Overly negative sources will scare you, not make you feel better.
The Autism Women's Network and Autism Acceptance Month websites have resources for parents.;
, Try Parenting Autistic Children with Love and Acceptance (PACLA), Respectfully Connected, Love Explosions, Emma's Hope Book (which is now co-run by Emma), and more. Reading stories of other loving families can be helpful, and remind you to keep a positive attitude.

, Parenting is exhausting work, full stop. Ask around about babysitters, in your family or elsewhere. (Grandma might be overjoyed to spend more time with her grandchildren.) You can also look into respite services, which are offered to parents of disabled children. This can give you time to recharge.

, If you're getting overwhelmed, take a break from the internet. It's okay to leave posts unread, and to be silent online for a while. You can come back once you have more energy., A well-rested parent is going to be much happier and more effective than an exhausted zombie. Use white noise, keep screens out of bed, keep a consistent bedtime schedule, and don't fear sleep medication if needed (for yourself or your child).If your child sleeps poorly, get them evaluated for epilepsy. This may be the cause., Lean on family members, relatives, friends, and others who can help you handle the hard times. Parenting doesn't have to be a solo operation.


Get familiar with the hashtag #AskAnAutistic. Post a question about your child there, and autistic teens and adults who had/have the same problem can tell you what worked for them.
Respect your child's privacy. No one wants information about their bad days or toileting habits online. If you have a pretty personal parenting question, post anonymously or under a fake name, to protect your family's privacy., It's okay to be frustrated, confused, worried, or sad. Take some quiet time to work through it in private, or with adults. Write in a journal, play sports, listen to music, or do whatever helps you cope.


Vent your frustrations only when you are certain that your child is out of earshot. You don't want to discover that they heard every word, and are now convinced that ""Daddy hates me.""
Consider therapy for yourself if you are having a very hard time.

, Putting in 110% effort into training your child every day isn't good for your health (or your child's). Let your family be imperfect. Let yourself take a rest.


If you're constantly battling to get your child to do more, you're doing it wrong. Ease up. Let yourself and your child relax for once. It'll be okay.

Consider reasons why a student might require an IEP.,
Refer the child to your school’s counselor or psychologist.,
Be aware of time limitations.,
Implement the IEP guidelines.",How to Obtain an IEP for a Student2," It is normal for kids to struggle sometimes. However, if you have noticed that a student is consistently struggling in the classroom, then he or she may benefit from an assessment to see if an IEP is necessary. You might recommend a child for an assessment if he or she:requires constant guidance to complete tasks.
is getting poor grades in the class even though he or she is working hard.
is showing extreme frustration with school work.
cannot remember a process because he or she does not understand the logic behind the process.
cannot remember things that you explained in class or in writing.
cannot read, write, or do math even if the child has strong general knowledge.
cannot communicate or process language effectively.

, If you have identified one or more reasons why an IEP assessment seems warranted, then you will need to refer the child to your school psychologist or counselor for an assessment.The school counselor or psychologist will meet with the child and send a request to the child’s parents to conduct an assessment.


You may also need to meet with the parents to discuss your concerns and find out if they have noticed similar challenges at home. You might say something like, “I am concerned about the challenges that Billy has been having in the classroom. He is working hard, but I think that he might need some additional help.”

, As soon as the child’s parents consent to an assessment, you and other members of the IEP team will only have 60 days to complete the IEP.This is because not having an IEP plan in place will interfere with the child’s ability to function in the classroom. Therefore, it is important to prioritize this process.


If you are on the IEP team, then make sure that you do your part as soon as possible. This may include providing an evaluation of the child’s classroom performance and/or behavior, assessing the child’s ability to complete certain tasks, or holding a conference with the parents and child.

, After the guidelines have been approved by the IEP team, then you will need to implement these guidelines in your classroom.The IEP guidelines may only require minor adjustments to the way that you provide instruction to the child, or they may mean that the child will need assistance from someone throughout the day.


For example, the child may be allotted more time to complete tasks, so you might need to let him continue working for longer than other students. Or, a child might need someone with him or her throughout the day to provide assistance with tasks.
You will also be responsible for measuring the child’s progress and reporting to parents on the child’s improvements in the classroom.

Throw out the developmental calendars.,
Focus on the child you have now.,
Meet some autistic adults with your child.,
Quit compliance therapies.,
Shield your child from anti-autism voices.,
Allow a little weirdness.,
Encourage your child's self esteem.,
Let your child play.,
Celebrate your child's strengths and abilities.",How to Love Your Autistic Child2," Your autistic child will develop at their own pace. You don't need to feel bad for your child being behind—it doesn't mean that you're failing at being a parent, or that they're failing childhood. It means they're autistic.


Your child may develop some skills early. This is great! Praise them, and encourage them to use these skills too.

, Dispel ""what-ifs"" about the non-autistic child you could have had, and stop focusing so much on the child you might have. You have a child here with you right now. They love you, and want to know that you love them too, and that you're proud of them.


Work on realistic goals, such as ""Get Kaelyn to use AAC"" or ""Teach her to say yes and no."" Focus on where your child is now, and what they can do next. Save goals like ""Consider Kaelyn's job prospects"" for when your child is old enough.
Mourning a non-existent child can be hard on the disabled child you already have., This can help you and your child envision what life will be like when you're older, and autistic adults can offer tips about what did and didn't help when they were younger.


This is especially important if you are worried about your child's future. It's helpful to see autistic adults doing well, so you know that your child can have the same.
It's also helpful for your child to see other people who are like them.

, Compliance-based therapies, especially ones focused on making children look ""normal,"" can do a lot of damage,and make a nonviolent child start lashing out.Let your child fidget, avoid eye contact, and stay comfortable. You might find a big improvement in mood.

, Turn off the TV if you notice a fearmongering ad comparing autism to deadly diseases. Stay away from Autism Speaks events. Keep your child away from people who say that autistic children are burdens that should be made normal or shouldn't exist. This type of rhetoric is toxic both to you and your child.

, Your child doesn't need to spend their childhood trying to blend in with everyone else. It's okay if they have quirky movements, use AAC instead of speech, or likes to chew on chew toys.There's no need to try to change your child's every movement, and both of you will end up frustrated and exhausted.


In general, if a quirk isn't hurting anyone, let it be.
If it is causing harm (e.g. self-injuring, disrupting a class, destroying things), then you can work on it.

, Even if it doesn't look like it, your child can hear what they are saying (unless they are literally deaf). Be mindful of your words while they are in earshot. Remember to discuss their positive traits as well as their weaknesses, celebrate their victories (even if they don't happen according to the developmental timeline), and show them that you're proud of them. If they fall into the trap of self hate, be supportive to them, and consider counseling.

, Childhood should have time for fun, so don't give in to the pressure to make your child work hard for long hours every day. Your child needs plenty of down time,and it's no fun to live with a child who is exhausted from 20+ hours of grueling therapy per week. Let them have self-directed play each day, even if their play looks odd to you.


See if your child likes a form of exercise, like walking, swimming, or playing catch with siblings., It's no fun to focus only on weaknesses. Praise what your child does well, and encourage them to work on the things they like and are good at.


Your child's special interests are a good place to start. Encourage them to learn about their favorite subjects, and work at skills involved (reading, bug catching, playing music, et cetera).

Love your child.",How to Help Your Autistic Child," Your child may have a hard time understanding how the world works around him or her. Maintaining consistency helps your child to find routines, rituals (such as tooth brushing at a certain time or after a given event like eating), a concept of order in what is otherwise perceived as chaos. It will help both your child and you to write down a specific schedule of the day and then to follow it when possible. An example of a beginning routine (schedule*) outlined below


Wake up.
Use bathroom.
Wash hands.
Wash face.
Come downstairs
Get in chair.
Eat breakfast.
Put plate in sink when done eating.
Watch X educational, child oriented TV program.;
,


Cleaning a room is necessary. Changing the order of items on the bureau is not.
Change increases anxiety and fear that the order of things is falling apart.
When changes are necessary, involve your child in the process so it is not a complete surprise. If you move furniture, for example, try to engage your child in the process, or at least allow them to observe and be aware of the changes. Explaining the reason for the change will help them understand why this is happening and make it less scary.
When changes occur in things like clothing or food, trying to find similar items will be less frightening for your child.
Some autistic people cannot handle rough textures, and best tolerate untreated/soft cotton. Exchange (or add) cotton for or to cotton items. Keep colors in the same family.

,


Children are often overwhelmed by fluorescent lighting, as it strobes. Non-autistic people often cannot see this, but many autistic people can. If you see that your child looks distressed or that the lights are flickering, ask if the lights are being bothersome.

, Autistic children are most often sensitive to noise. Noises that neurotypicals can filter out can be confusing or even painful to an autistic person.


Buffer ‘rebound’ noise, or loud sounds in general by putting tapestries on walls, using soft fabrics on furniture that has some texture, adding room dividing decorative elements etc.
Be careful about competing sounds. The television will get turned up if people are speaking, which will cause people to speak louder and so forth. The more competing sounds, the more likely your child is to hear a loud mush of unintelligible sound only and become overwhelmed.

, If your child starts becoming overwhelmed, they will naturally seek out what they need: peace. Try creating a quiet enclave where they can retreat when needed.


Don't let siblings and other family members bother your child when they need quiet. This could lead to an outburst.
If they were in the middle of something, such as eating or doing homework, let them come back to it once they are calmer. Or, they may be able to do it in the quiet location, such as a teenager eating in her bedroom.

, Autistic children are often very curious about their environments. This can include the dangerous parts. Interest in things that may be dangerous must be monitored, such as a fish tank with glass and electric components to heat or aerate the water.


Set boundaries and explain why the boundary is set. For example, ""It is not okay to play with the power outlets, because you could get hurt.""
If your child isn't likely to be cautious, it may be better to move fish tanks out of reach.
Offer to explore the fishtank or heater together, explaining it as best as you can. This allows you to monitor your child's safety while sating your child's curiosity.
If age-appropriate, show your child the wonders of the internet and all its diagrams. Also check the library for picture books with diagrams.

, Stimming includes a variety of activities that stimulate the senses.(staring at turning wheels, making repeated noises, etc). It allows autistic people to express themselves and feel good.


Stimming helps prevent meltdowns, increases self-control, and enables better focus.Be wary of therapists who wish to end stimming, as this may harm your child.If your child stims in a harmful way, talk to a therapist about finding a substitute stim that fulfills the same need. You can also reach out to autistic people through #AskAnAutistic, as they may have had the same stim, and could offer advice on finding a good replacement. For example, a girl who bites herself when stressed could bite a chewy bracelet instead.

, Autistic children often experience intense, passionate interests in certain areas. These interests provide joy in their lives, and can be used as tools to develop new skills (e.g. library books about cats to encourage reading and study skills).


Relating new information to the child's passions may help the child be interested and engaged in learning. For example, if your child struggles with social skills and loves dinosaurs, she may enjoy books about dinosaur friends.

, Autistic people don't always look at something or someone they are listening to, and may stim while listening. Thus, even if they look inattentive by non-autistic standards, they may be listening closely to every word you say.

, Overload is when a person becomes overwhelmed by sensory stimuli and experiences a meltdown or a shutdown. Both cases may involve crying, covering ears, panicked stimming, and avoidant behavior.


Meltdowns may be characterized by screaming, crying, throwing oneself on the floor, etc. Unlike tantrums, meltdowns are caused by a build-up of stress, and the child feels a loss of control.Autistic people often feel bad about melting down afterwards.Shutdowns are characterized by withdrawal, distress, passivity, and loss of interest or ability to communicate.
Occupational therapists can increase your child's tolerance to stimuli through sensory integration therapy.

, Some autistic children cannot tell you if their tummy hurts or if their ear aches. Other autistic children don't understand the sensations their body is telling them and may not realize that they are sick. Keep an eye on your child's behavior. If you sense something unusual in the child's health, ask them how they are feeling (as sometimes that prompts them to think hard and realize something as wrong), and call your GP immediately if you believe they are ill.


Self-injurious stimming may signal a health issue. For example, a child might head-bang when they have tooth pain., Talk to your child, even if the conversation is one-sided for now, and let them participate in conversations as well as hearing them.


Some autistic children have the ability to speak, but do not understand the need to do so. Keep your child informed, while also increasing language exposure and teaching simply by talking with your child as you go about your day.
Speak as if you expect your child to answer (either verbally or nonverbally). All too often, parents talk about their child without talking with their child. This only increases the sense of not being a part of things for your child.
For young children, speak in clear and concrete language. Speak avoiding slang and expressions (it is raining cats and dogs), but do not talk down to your child, because (s)he can tell the difference. For older children, talk normally and respectfully, making it clear that you will be polite if your child is confused by a figure of speech or needs you to repeat something.

, If your child cannot speak yet, find a form of AAC (such as picture exchange, sign language) that will allow them to express themselves. Being able to communicate needs, thoughts, and feelings can reduce frustrations and meltdowns in your child.


Watch for nonverbal responses. For example, if you ask ""Did you have fun at preschool?"" and your child flaps their hands and shrieks happily, then this is their answer. Continue maintaining a dialogue.
Don't pressure your child to speak. Some autistic people are incapable of speaking, or they find it difficult and stressful. Allow your child to communicate through gestures, sign language, or by pointing to a picture board.

, This means that your child needs to listen when you tell them no, and that you will pay attention to them if they communicate a no. Help by following up with an explanation, such as ""If you wander off without telling me, I feel scared and worried that you aren't safe.""

Obviously, if your child says ""no"" to bedtime or their car seat, you don't need to follow it. But you can slow down and explain why it is important. This lets them know that even though you won't always do what they want, the word ""no"" has meaning.
If you ignore a child's attempts to say no or set boundaries (e.g. ""I don't like kisses""), they may learn that ""no"" isn't important. If no one listens to them, they learn that listening is optional, so they won't listen to you.

, Your child is competent and capable of following rules, so expect them to do so. Clearly describe the rules to your child, why the rules are in place, and explain what they should do instead of doing something wrong.


For example, ""It is not okay to hit people because hitting hurts them. Instead of hitting, please talk to them, take time to cool off, or ask an adult for help if you don't know what to do.""

, Many times autistic kids are visually oriented. Sometimes nonverbal children are able to communicate using sign language or by pointing to pictures in a special book put together to help them communicate. Even autistic kids who speak may benefit by making a visual chart for the schedule for the day. If you're trying to teach your child how to do something it may help to make a picture chart. (Some autistic kids can even repeat verbal instructions word for word but still lack the ability to turn those instructions into actions in their head. Pictures may somehow help them to do that.)

, Therapy can help your child grow into a happy, healthy, well-adjusted autistic person. Pinpoint specific issues, such as social uncertainty or sensory sensitivity, and work with the therapist to help your child develop skills.


Avoid therapies that involve forced normalization, compliance, or too many hours per week. Your child should be able to set boundaries, be themselves, and have time to enjoy childhood.

, Your child will always be autistic, even as an adult. This doesn't mean they will be miserable, or that they will have a terrible life. There are many autistic people who grow into happy autistic adults. They don't have to be ""normal"" in order to have a good life.

, Your child is different, so it's okay if they aren't talking as much as Robert next door or reading chapter books like Amaya down the street. Autistic kids follow their own timeline.This doesn't mean that you're a bad parent, or that either one of you is a failure. You are raising your child, not anyone else's, so you don't have to do what they are doing.


Make goals based on building upon where your child already is, not where the developmental timelines say they ""should"" be. This might mean getting chapter books for your six-year-old, or teaching your fourteen-year-old to type.

, If you delay telling them, they may think it is something to be scared or ashamed of. Tell them early on, and expect to have multiple conversations over time. Use an open and factual tone of voice to indicate that autism is nothing scary or bad.


Frame it in terms of strengths as well as needs. For example, ""Autism is why loud noises bother you and transitions are hard. It's also why you know so much about dogs, and love nature so much. It has hard parts and fun parts.""

, There will be days when your child does well, and days when they melt down or struggle to perform skills they could do before. Don't be discouraged. Sometimes finding out what isn't working can be as beneficial in the long run as finding out what works, so you know what to avoid.

, They can offer advice if you don't know what to do about your child smearing peanut butter on the floor or crying at birthday parties. Many of them went through the same things as children, and can offer a first-person perspective on what it was like. They can tell you what worked for them, what didn't work, and what they'd like you to know.


The hashtag #ActuallyAutistic is for autistic people to write things (which non-autistics may read), and the hashtag #AskAnAutistic is where anyone can post questions for autistic people to answer.
Watching them can also give you an idea of what your child may look like as an adult.

, You know your child, you have experience reading and learning their body language, and you can tell when something is upsetting to them or too far outside their comfort zone. If you think that a specialist is not treating your child well, take yourself seriously.



Bad therapies exist.
Therapy should not be grueling or painful work. If it often results in tears and frustration, you have a right to be concerned.
If a therapist is making you uncomfortable, tells you not to trust yourself, or bars you from seeing the therapy, this is not okay. If you feel concerned about your child being upset in therapy, this is valid. Your instincts matter, and a therapist should respect them.
It is okay to decline a certain type of therapy, or to decide to see a different therapist.

, You are the model of what others will think and believe about your child. If you treat your child with kindness and respect, others will too, and your child will grow up feeling like a complete and worthwhile person. It is perfectly fine to explain to someone that your child is autistic, but never apologize for it and never make excuses. Your child is lovable, autism and all.

You can help them with this by letting them meet other autistic adults (find a local group of parents who also have autistic children).


You can also help your son or daughter meet others like them online. This will help them hone their ability to make friends and get into the rhythm of building relationships.
This will make workplace interactions easier for them as they move out of the home environment to their new place of work. Social skills are very important and must be mastered as much as possible.;
, Improve his social communication skills using:


Picture exchange communication system; this consists of a set of cards with different symbols about various objects. The person uses these cards to tell others about his preferences or needs.
Social stories; these are descriptions about social situations that help people with learning difficulties to understand the appropriate behavior in a particular situation.
Comic strip conversations; this includes drawings, speech bubbles and thought bubbles to help children understand the underlying meaning and demands of a situation.
Scripts; this combines social stories and comic script conversation. It enables them to understand emotions and social context.

, For choosing the right job, one-on-one assessment of abilities and interests should be done to accurately evaluate which skills your child is good at and which factors he needs to improve on.


If he shows interest in organizing and lining up things, book keeping would be a good job for him. If your child is good at visual thinking he should get a job like drafting, photography, art work. If his math is good, he can be an accountant or bank teller.
Before choosing a job you should ask your child and yourself if that job is practically possible or not. To do this, you have to match his potential with the job requirements, while also considering his limitations.

, Many autistic children and adults focus on details and parts. They think in concrete terms. They possess hyper focus. This makes computer jobs, tech jobs, hyper-focus jobs a good fit for them.


They tend to prefer jobs which demand high focus on details and leave little room for error. As a result, many autistics are known to be apt software engineers.
They have problems in communicating socially but they can communicate logically about different designs and logics. Give your child a computer and give him the opportunity to develop his skills in web design, software programming and other specializations. He might be a genius in this field.

, Some schools offer high school transition programs. This is because many autistic children find it difficult to move from school to college. They might have to face bullying and mocking by others at college, or get confused by the larger, unfamiliar campus.


Some autistic people even spend 5 to 6 years at home after graduating from high school, because they or their parents feel that they are not ready for college. However, no time should be wasted like this.
Parents should decide in advance about what to do when their child graduates high school. One year high school transition programs could be quite helpful in solving this problem.

, In order to sustain a job it is necessary for the autistic person to undergo intensive vocational training. Some companies themselves provide this training.


This training involves essential curriculum, such as providing staff support in collaboration with community based employers. It is focuses on maximizing employment potential.
The autistic adult should be informed thoroughly about the job requirements, routines, rules and regulations. Some schools provide this kind of training to children, preparing them for having jobs.

, After high school, social networks are often lost or becomes limited. Social meetings at school provide great opportunities to learn and develop social relationships. After high school this opportunity often disappears, but this should not be the case.


Your child should meet different people on a regular basis in some club or gatherings at home. Take him to social places in order to learn more and more social skills. You may also join a gym with your autistic child. It will make both of you physically fit and socially active. Allow him to join clubs with his class fellows.
Take him to parks and other social events like wedding ceremonies, birthday parties, social clubs etc. don’t force him to stay at home just so he feels secure and avoids bullying. He has to face the world. But don’t leave him alone in new places.

, Your child needs to feel motivated about getting a job. Motivation is especially relevant to today’s society. `A status seeking individual tends to be more ambitious and hard working. Motivate them to earn their own money and gain some independence in life.

, Find a job that suits the unique attributes of people with ASD – the good thing about being different (in the context of having ASD) is that people with this condition have specific strengths that can give them an edge in some jobs. If you have an autistic son or daughter who is keen on the idea of working, these are some tips you might want to note in helping him land the best job for him or her.


The job must have a defined endpoint.
The job should involve a set routines. People with ASD do well with routines.
Autistic adults are often good at music or art and have a knack for details. The best way to highlight this strength is to make a portfolio of your autistic child’s work. This stresses their well developed abilities, not necessarily on his or her personality.
Make sure that the company you are seriously considering for your child’s employment is inclined to accept people with ASD with your child’s direct superior having enough experience and knowledge on the social limitations of your autistic child.

, You should talk to your adult child about getting employment. Ask him what he wants to do. Discuss his fears and concerns. Invite him to share his feelings about his life and getting a job.


Every new change could create lot of distress and tension for an autistic adult. Try to make him feel relaxed and optimistic. Autistic people vary tremendously in their symptoms and behavior.
Try to find out if your child prefers to work alone, with one or two persons or with a group. Choose a job for him accordingly.

, If your child does not possess good language skills and is not able to communicate verbally, he could have any one of the following jobs;


Plant care like gardening, warehouse worker, library assistant, restocking shelves, data entry, janitor jobs, fast food attendant, photocopy shop, factory assembling job etc.
If your adult child possesses good visual thinking abilities he could have many jobs like web designer, video game designer, laboratory technician, computer animation, factory maintenance, computer trouble shooter, automobile mechanic, journalist, carpenter or welder, commercial art, etc.
If he is an expert in mathematics he could be an accountant as mentioned above, engineer, inventory controller, bank teller, statistician, mathematician, telemarketing etc.

, While making any decision for your adult child, your focus should be his strengths and skills.


Don’t pay attention only to his disabilities and dysfunctions. He will overcome his limitations and disabilities with the passage of time. Give him opportunity to show his talents, don’t make him feel incompetent or disabled.
It is now believed that autistic people need opportunity more than therapy or treatment. They have their specific talents that need to be recognized and appreciated.

, Encourage your autistic son or daughter towards employment – your autistic son or daughter must have a healthy attitude towards employment. The last thing you want to do is force them into it. This will just make them more resistant to the idea and will certainly defeat your long term purpose for the move.


Why do they need to get a job in the first place? Employment can provide an immense boost of self confidence to your autistic child and can be very beneficial for his or her social and personal life. It will also allow him or her to grow out of his or her shell and face the world with courage and confidence instead of cowering in his or her room.
Employment also allows you to prepare them for the future. You cannot always be there for them. Setting them up for life can give you peace of mind. It is a win-win plan for you and your child.

, Arrange for your autistic child’s to have their own place – a big part of your autistic child’s inclination to have his or her own job is having his or her own place to live – away from you and other people who have been part of his support system in the past.


This will provide your autistic child with some space to adjust to his new way of life, far and independent from his or her parents and siblings. Ideally this new place must be near the workplace.
Commuting to and from work can be stressful to a person with ASD so addressing this concern by renting a place near his or her workplace can help a lot in settling a major source of anxiety and discomfort of your autistic adult child.

, You should make a portfolio of your child's work. Mention their past experiences, previous jobs and required certificates. Tell the person or the interviewer about their talents and potentials.


Also mention any social limitations or other difficulties. The employer should know about any potential issues or if they will need to make any special allowances in any aspect of job.

, Many companies now offer jobs to autistic adults, especially to the gifted ones with better intellectual abilities and higher achievements.


Two such examples are The Home Depot and CVS Caremark pharmacies. Now employers have started thinking about autism as an asset and not a disability. They prefer hiring autistic adults to do work with higher accuracy and reliability.

, Do some preparation for the interview. This might involve the use of cards or icons, or simply going over basic interview questions several times over.


He should be able to answer simple questions either verbally or through pictures or sign language. This will help him to feel confident while actually having the interview.
You should also be prepared for the interview. The employer might ask you about the strengths and limitations of your son, the education interventions used in school, what makes him upset, what behavior therapies work best for him etc. You should be able to answer any question about your child. They might ask you about his general problems and the possible solutions used.
They will also ask him about his education, favorite subjects, previous experience, expected salary, any extra allowances he needs, etc.

Start with Mountain Pose.,
Practice Roaring Lion Pose.,
Do Tree Pose.,
Practice Superman Pose.,
Try Drawbridge Pose.,
Wind down with Child’s Pose.",How to Help Kids Manage ADHD with Yoga1," Mountain pose is a great introductory pose that you can do with kids with ADHD.

Place your hands on your knees and sit up straight.
Then, open your mouth and close your eyes. Extend your tongue out and down, wrinkling your nose. Inhale and then as you breathe out, release a “ROARRRR” sound.
Repeat this sound five times, for five breaths total. It can be fun to do this pose in front of a mirror, as you get to roar at your own reflection.

, Tree pose is good for focus and concentration. It is also a good challenge for children with ADHD to stay focused enough to maintain their balance.Begin by standing with your palms together with your thumbs at your sternum. Keep your palms together and slowly raise your hands over your head. Then, lower them back down to the starting position. Repeat this several times, synchronizing your inhalation with an upward motion and your exhalation with a downward motion.
Add on the balancing component by focusing on an unmoving spot on the floor four feet away from you. Then, raise your right leg and place your right foot against your left calf, with your bent leg facing the right side.
Hold this pose for five breaths and then release. Switch to the other side, lifting your left foot and placing it against your right calf.

, This pose can help the child become more aware of their body movements and feel more grounded.

Once the child seems comfortable with lifting and lowering their limbs, you can try the full posture. Inhale and lift both your arms and legs off the ground. You should feel like you’re flying like a superhero. Then, exhale and lower your limbs. Repeat this pose for four to five full breaths.

, This pose is good for centering the child and allowing them to have more control over the movement of their body. This is a good pose to also help your child relax, especially if they seem to be getting agitated or hyper.Start by lying on your back with your arms by your sides and your palms face down. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the ground. They should be hip width apart and close enough that you can touch your heels with your hands.
Inhale as you press firmly into your feet and hands. Lift your hips off the ground like the raising of a drawbridge. Then, exhale as you lower your hips down to the ground.
Repeat this pose for four to five breaths. Once you are done, hug your knees to your chest for five to ten breaths.

, This pose is great for concluding a yoga session or as a last yoga pose before bed. You can teach the child to go into this pose if they start to feel overwhelmed or hyper, as it can be very calming and relaxing.To do Child’s Pose, kneel down and sit on your feet with your knees separated. You may allow your knees to form a wide “v” shape on the mat. Inhale and place your forehead on the ground in front of your knees, curving your spine. Extend your arms forward and breathe deeply in this pose for two to five minutes.
Come out of the pose slowly, lifting your arms and head. Sit back on your feet and take a few cleansing breathes to end your practice.

Look for a yoga class for kids with ADHD in your area.,
Watch yoga videos online.,
Hire a private yoga instructor.",How to Help Kids Manage ADHD with Yoga2," Not all yoga teachers will be experienced enough to work with children with ADHD. You should look for a yoga class taught by an instructor who has a solid foundation in yoga and is also aware of how to interact with individuals with ADHD. The teacher may be certified to work with developmentally challenged children or have extensive experience teaching children with ADHD.Most yoga classes for children with ADHD will have two to three children at a time. This will allow the yoga teacher to work patiently and carefully with each child.

, You can get professional yoga instruction on a budget by looking for yoga videos online that focus on poses for individuals with ADHD. You may subscribe to a few video channels online so you can view new videos every week and integrate them into yoga sessions with the child.You may also ask parents or teachers who work with children with ADHD for recommendations on yoga video channels or sites.

, You may opt for hiring a yoga instructor for private lessons for the child so they get one on one attention. Look for a yoga instructor who is certified to teach children with ADHD and who has worked with children with ADHD before. The instructor should appear patient, confident, and open with the child in the one on one sessions.The teacher may also include brief rituals in their sessions, like lighting incense or setting up a mat, so the child gets used to focusing on specific tasks. They may then do a series of poses, taking the time to get the child to focus and relax during the session.

Have a deep breathing session once a day.,
Do a few yoga poses before bed.,
Schedule regular, weekly yoga sessions.,
Do yoga outside to help the child focus.,
Vary the yoga poses you do with the child.",How to Help Kids Manage ADHD with Yoga3," Starting a yoga routine with the child can really benefit them in the long run. It can also make them more comfortable with doing yoga and over time, gain more confidence. You may begin by setting aside time in the child’s schedule to do deep breathing once a day. Deep breathing sessions can be a good way to help your child focus and relax. They can then use deep breathing when they are doing yoga poses.You can sit with the child in a quiet, darkened room in a comfortable position to do deep breathing. Try to do at least ten to fifteen slow deep inhales and exhales. You may have the child place one hand on their stomach and one hand on their chest to help them get used to inhaling and exhaling deeply.

, You may also encourage the child do to a few relaxing yoga poses before they go to bed. You may do them together as part of the child’s bedtime routine. Doing relaxing poses before bed can help the child settle down and get in rest mode.For example, you may do Mountain Pose, Drawbridge Pose, and Child’s Pose together before bed. Make sure you synchronize your movements with your inhales and exhales.

, You should try to have weekly yoga sessions with the child so they get used to doing the yoga poses and more confident doing them. You may enroll the child in a weekly yoga class for children with ADHD or arrange for a private yoga session.You may also have your own sessions at home with the child so they get used to doing yoga at least once a week.

, If you find the child is having difficulties focusing on the yoga poses, you may try moving the session outside. Studies have shown that children with ADHD have better concentration when they are outdoors in natural, green environments.You may move the yoga sessions to your backyard or to a green space by your home. You may also try to have some of the yoga sessions indoors and some sessions outdoors so the child feels they have variety.

, Children with ADHD do well with active, varied learning. They tend to get bored easily and become distracted once they have lost interest in an activity. You can keep the child focused by doing different yoga poses or the same yoga poses in a different order during the yoga sessions.You may also try to incorporate other physical activities with yoga so the child feels challenged and stimulated.
If you take the child to a yoga class, make sure the instructor varies the yoga poses done in the class week to week so the child stays engaged.

Treat them like a person, not a project.,
Find fun ways to learn and work on their weaknesses.,
Make it clear that it is okay to be different.,
Help them meet other disabled people and find disabled role models.,
Read from people who have your child's specific disability.",How to Live Happily with a Disabled Child1," With specialists constantly talking about ""deficits"" and ""delays,"" it can be difficult to say ""My child is capable too!"" Take plenty of time to work together with your child, and also appreciate their individual strengths.


Work with them, not on them.
Buy toys related to their strengths and favorite things, not only toys to develop lagging skills.
Make sure therapy is fun and consensual.;
, A light atmosphere will help them enjoy therapy and other educational activities, making it easier for all parties.


Read books in silly voices.
Play games and talk about fun things to naturally pick up social skills.
Integrate your child's hobbies when doing therapy projects.
Find an occupational therapist who recommends play activities, such as animal walks or finger painting, that are specifically tailored to your child's needs.

, Teach your child that their disability is natural and acceptable, just like your son's peanut allergy or your love of high heels. This helps them know that they are not burdensome or broken.


Be factual and kind when explaining their disability.
Do not try to hide their disability or suppress symptoms such as stimming—this hurts the child's psyche.
Speak respectfully about other people's differences (disability, race, LGBT+, etc.), so your child learns that diversity is natural and okay.

, Knowing others like them will help boost their self-confidence and remind them that they can be strong and successful the way they are.


Make disabled friends.
Have your child join a disability group, such as the Special Olympics or a Deaf kids' group.
Bring your child books about disabled people like Helen Keller and Woodrow Wilson.

Remove and replace fluorescent lights.,
Use unscented household products.,

Encourage your child to go to their private space if they are overwhelmed or scared.,
Talk to your neighbors.",How to Make a Secure Home for an Autistic Child," Many autistic people have severe sensory problems with fluorescent lights. If you have any fluorescent lighting in your home, replace it with soft, warm lamps or non-fluorescent fixtures.The reasons autistic people have difficulty with fluorescent lights differ depending on the person. For some, it is a visual disturbance. Their eyes are more sensitive to light and light patterns than yours may be, and fluorescent lights have a strobing effect. Imagine how annoyed you would be if someone kept turning the lights on and off repeatedly.
Other autistic people have highly sensitive hearing and can actually hear the hum of fluorescent lights in a way that is actively annoying. Think of a fly or mosquito buzzing in your ear.
Autistic children may have problems with other lights as well, particularly if they're extremely harsh or bright.
If your child is non-verbal, pay attention to how they act in various rooms of the house. For example, if your child seems particularly agitated in the kitchen, turn off the overhead light and see if the child relaxes.
Even fairly communicative autistic children may nevertheless have difficulty telling you the lights in the room are bothering them. They may not even realize themselves that the lights are the problem until you change them.;
, Many autistic children become agitated by harsh smells. Even a smell you think is nice – such as fabric softener – can be irritating if it is too strong or noticeable.You can find unscented cleaners and detergents anywhere you normally buy your household cleaning supplies.
Think of all the different smells you have in your home, and adjust or eliminate them if your child reacts unfavorably to them or shows signs of agitation.
Heightened sensitivity to smell also can cause a reaction to personal care products such as body washes, lotions, aftershaves, colognes, and perfumes.
Some autistic children also may have allergies to ingredients commonly found in household cleaning and personal care products. Allergies can cause headaches and other distress.
If your child is non-verbal, they may be unable to tell you what's going on. Remove the source of the harsh or strong smell, and see if you notice a difference in your child's behavior.

, Autistic children typically respond well to a routine, because they know what to expect – and what's expected of them – over the course of the day. A routine can help the autistic child feel more secure at home.To some extent, this means everybody in the home will have to follow a routine – at least when viewed through the eyes of your autistic child.
If the child knows where everyone will be over the course of the day, they will be less anxious.
This doesn't necessarily mean you have to plan your own schedule in rigid, half-hour blocks if that doesn't work for you. However, make an effort to keep things fairly routinized during the child's waking hours – particularly in relation to activities that involve the child.
For example, set a time that the family will have dinner every night. If you need to deviate from this schedule for any reason, let your autistic child know in advance and give them the information they need to understand and prepare for that disruption in their routine.

, Autistic children need a place where they can retreat from an overstimulating and demanding world. Work with your child to create this place and fill it with their favorite things.Many autistic children have their place in their own room, but other children favor a different part of the house.
Do what you can to make it safe and easy for the child to reach their safe space, particularly if it is in an area where they potentially could get hurt.
For example, some autistic children prefer to be higher up off the ground. You may create a place for such a child on an upstairs landing that overlooks the downstairs. Other autistic children want to be under things, so they may create space under a table or counter.
A small outdoor tent is a relatively inexpensive way to create a private space in an otherwise open area of the house that's prone to heavy traffic.
Once you create the private space for your child, make an effort not to touch it or anything in it, or to intrude on the space.

, Most autistic children prefer things have a sense of order, but the way your child would organize things may not be particularly functional or helpful for you.For example, your child may want all the food in the pantry to be arranged according to the size of the box or can, while you want your pantry arranged by food type.
Keep things in the house neat, and explain to your child the reason for a particular method of organization. You might say ""The pantry is arranged by type of food so mommy can easily find your favorite foods for dinner and know when we need to get more.""
Keeping things organized also keeps distractions to a minimum. Many autistic children have difficulty focusing in a space that's cluttered or full of haphazard objects. Use drawers and opaque bins to reduce visual clutter.

, Autistic children often experience over-stimulation because there is too much going on and they lack the ability to filter the various sensory inputs. Be aware of the different sensory inputs in your home and try to eliminate multiple inputs at the same time.For example, if the family is watching television, don't do laundry or run the dishwasher at the same time. Close doors to other areas of the house where there is noise.
When someone is speaking, put the television or stereo on mute rather than talking over the other sound. Autistic children can have difficulty distinguishing sound from multiple sources and they may literally not hear you if you're talking with background noise.
You also should try to avoid having light coming from multiple sources. For example, if the television is on, turn off the overhead light in the room. Turn off lights in other rooms when no one is in them.

, Purchase child-safety latches at a discount or home improvement store and use them on kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors and drawers you don't want your autistic child to get into.You also may want to use catches with the same doors and drawers to keep them from slamming shut and potentially injuring your child.
Where possible, install the latches where the child cannot reach them. This may become more difficult as the child gets older, but hopefully as they get older they will have learned how to be safe.
You also can use signs as visual reminders of areas of the house that are off-limits to the child, or that the child shouldn't access without an adult present.
Find a bright, positive image you can use for your signs, and place them at the child's eye level.

, All children are naturally curious, including autistic children. Electrical items such as hair dryers or toasters can cause severe injury and property damage if left plugged in and unattended.Use caution when you are using appliances to ensure that your child is out of the way or otherwise occupied.
When appliances and other electrical devices are plugged in, keep the cords out of the way so they do not become a tripping hazard. You also want to watch for hanging cords, which can be tempting to grab or pull.
Use electrical outlet covers on outlets that aren't in use to keep your child from sticking anything in them. Teach your child that electrical outlets are not safe to play with, because they can shock you.

, All homes contain some items which would be dangerous to any child if they got ahold of them. Household cleaners with poisonous chemicals and sharp objects such as kitchen knives should be locked away.Store them in a locked box or container on a high shelf or other area out of reach to your child.
Make sure your child understands that these things are not for them, but also avoid leaving them around where your child might be tempted to investigate them.
Avoid using dangerous items in your child's presence, as they may become more interested in those items if they see you using them.

, How you arrange the furniture in your house will depend on the everyday behavior of your particular child. Do what you can to accommodate the child's non-destructive behavior as well as prevent them from getting injured.For example, if your child likes to run, give them space to run around the house without running into anything or knocking anything over.
Put padding on sharp corners and edges so your child won't get hurt if they bump into them. You may want to replace glass tables or shelves, which could easily be broken.
Attach taller furniture such as bookcases or dressers to the wall so your child can't pull them over.
Avoid placing furniture near windows that your child could climb on to reach the window and climb out.

, If you want to keep your child out of certain areas of the house entirely, a baby gate can be a temporary solution to indicate that the area is off-limits. These gates have the benefit of being entirely removable.You can typically find a baby gate and home improvement and discount chain stores. You also may be able to find used ones at online auction sites or even in a local garage sale.
You may want to attach a sign to the gate, similar to the ones you placed on cabinet doors, to communicate to the child that whatever is beyond that gate is off limits.

, Autistic children are naturally curious, and may want to explore certain areas of the neighborhood. If they're interested in exploring, give them a time to wander with an ability-appropriate level of adult supervision. This way, they can satisfy their curiosity and have fun while still having someone to look out for them.


For example, if your child expresses curiosity about some nearby woods, you could take them for a leisurely walk in the woods so they can explore.
Older, more responsible children can be given parameters. For example, ""You may wander in the field next to the restaurant while we finish eating,"" or ""You have the run of the park and I'll be here with my book if you need me.""

, Autistic children often enjoy playing outdoors. Fencing in your yard can give them a safe and controlled place to play outside without having to worry about outside threats.To work properly, the fence should completely enclose an area with no large gaps. Any gates should be locked from the outside.
Keep in mind that if you plan to fence your entire property, you typically must first complete a survey to ensure the proper boundaries between your property and that of your neighbors.
If you live in an apartment or rent a house, fencing your yard may not be an option. In this case, try to make time to go outside with your child each day so they aren't tempted to wander out on their own.

, Many parents are concerned that they will turn their home into a prison if they keep all the doors and windows locked at all times. However, doing so can keep your child from wandering away.Try to use locks that your child cannot reach and open themselves. This may mean installing an additional lock at the top of the door or window where your child can't reach.
If your child frequently gets up at night and wanders around, you may want to lock them in their room. You may think this sounds cruel, but it is for their own safety. Make sure they have a way to communicate with you if they need to get out of their room for a legitimate reason.
Keep in mind that many autistic children actually feel more comfortable and relaxed if the doors and windows are secure and they know that nobody can go in or out of the house.

, You don't necessarily have to spring for an expensive security system for your home. A simple bell on a string can let you know if a door or window is opened.The point with these alarms is to notify you that the door or window has been opened – not to frighten your child.
You can hang a bell or buzzer just on the edge of a door so that the door brushes it when it opens. You also can hang a bell from the door so that it rings when the door is moved.

, Sometimes, autistic children run off because they can't handle a situation. Teach your child that they can run to their quiet place, and that they'll be left alone to relax there. This way, they don't need to leave home to find peace.


Make sure that the private space remains a refuge. Avoid bothering your child when they are inside it, and don't let other children intrude upon the space. If the child gets interrupted when they are trying to calm down there, they'll learn that it isn't a peaceful space, and may try to run away in order to find somewhere more secluded.

, Particularly if your child is prone to wandering away from home, it's important that all of your neighbors understand that your child is autistic and know what to do if they see them wandering around the neighborhood.Let them know if your child should be approached, and what is a safe way to do so. If your child is non-verbal and has difficulty with strangers, you may want to tell your neighbors to keep the child in sight and call you instead of approaching them themselves.
You also may want to let local law enforcement or the fire department know about your autistic child, in case they have wandered off or there is an emergency.
This is particularly important if your child is non-verbal. Autistic children can panic if people are demanding or confrontational towards them, and could lash out or flee in fear.

Try to keep each day similar to the rest.,
Discuss sensory overload and meltdown management strategies ahead of time.,
Listen to them when they tell you that something hurts or is difficult.,
Give them plenty of exercise and time outdoors.,
Make time for their special interests.,
Teach them to speak about their interests in moderation.,
Stay with them.,
Give the autistic person plenty of downtime.,
Build a team of caring adults to help your child learn and grow.,
Find support groups, for both the family member and yourself.,
Try to learn as much about autism as you can.,
Appreciate their quirks.,
Love and accept them.",How to Help an Autistic Family Member," A girl who doesn't talk and constantly flaps her arms may still be very capable of understanding what you are saying. Even if your loved one can't understand you, they still appreciate your confidence and trust in them.;
, Be clear about your thoughts and feelings, and give occasional pauses so they have time to think and consider how to respond. Avoid exaggeration if they don't understand figurative speech well.


Don't force them to make eye contact or stop stimming when they listen. This can make it very difficult for them to concentrate.

, If they are ""zoned out,"" they might not realize that you want to talk, and might not hear a word you say. Say their name, and see that they look up or acknowledge you before you begin to talk.

, Autistic people don't ""do it on purpose"", and they can't help many of their idiosyncrasies. They're not trying to annoy you or being intentionally difficult. They're doing the best they can with what they have, just like you are.

, Some autistic people love to talk passionately about their special interests, or need to ask lots of questions before they feel that they understand. Usually, persistent questioning is an attempt to bond with you—they're hoping that you'll open up and they want to listen.


If you are feeling drained, or need to do something else, just politely explain that you are tired, or you need to go do something else. You have a right to set boundaries.

, This can help them concentrate and stay calm. If their stimming is extremely distracting (e.g. their pacing is making you dizzy), ask them to switch to a different stim (e.g. rocking in a rocking chair while knitting).


For their hands, try providing stress balls, tangles, fidget toys, and craft materials such as beads or yarn.
Active people may sit better on rocking chairs or exercise balls.

, Some autistic people struggle to remember to do the most mundane things. Even a teenager or adult may benefit from having a list of things to do every morning, like ""brush your teeth"", ""take a shower"", et cetera.


Consider adding pictures to the list, especially if the person is young or has limited reading skills.
The list can be hidden in a drawer if the person is embarrassed by needing it.

, Include everything that goes on in a day. If the person is school-aged, include things like ""leave for school"", ""get home from school"", ""do homework"", ""eat a snack"", et cetera. Be sure to include free time!


Laminate the schedule so that you can write temporary changes with a marker. For example, write when somebody comes to visit, or when school is on vacation.

, They can feel very disorienting and upsetting to autistic people, so introducing them gently is important. Give them as much time as possible to get used to it and understand it.


If a last-minute change must be made, write it on the schedule in dry-erase pen as soon as possible.
Give them plenty of time to adjust and prepare for a change. Giving them multiple reminders will help them be emotionally ready.
Don't plan surprises, even ones you that you think would be fun. Avoid surprise parties. Tell the autistic person if you plan to take them out to a restaurant, attend a carnival, or anything that's not routine for them.

, This helps them see how today will be different from yesterday, especially from the weekends to weekdays.


If there are things that happen less than daily, remind the person of them the night before, again in the morning, and again if possible shortly before the event. This includes sports practices, math tournaments, and music or dance lessons.

, For example, if the person has a baseball practice one day, plan something every day at that time. That way, the person won't be used to being home and having free time or studying at the time they go to baseball the one day.

, Get together with the autistic person and brainstorm ways to make group outings more fun for everyone. This should include...


Minimizing upsetting or painful stimuli
Avoiding negative stimuli
How to escape from an overwhelming situation
Self-calming strategies (deep breaths, counting, taking a break, etc.)

, A sweater that feels slightly scratchy wool to you could feel like a swarm of angry fire ants to them. Always try to accommodate their needs—turn down the volume, go somewhere else, or give them earplugs and white noise so they feel okay.


Never say ""you can deal with it"" or ""it can't hurt that much."" This teaches them to deny the fact that they are uncomfortable or in pain. This can be dangerous when they have a tangible medical problem, but end up suffering in silence, because they think that it must be nothing—that's what they were told when they had sensory issues that hurt just as much.
Encourage to try things that are just slightly out of their comfort zone. For example, offer to add a tiny bit of spice to their favorite meal, to help them adjust to eating spicier foods. Keep it playful, and let them back out of it whenever they want. This helps their brain learn to process it, and it introduces new things in a safe and nonthreatening way.

, The exercise will give them a way to channel their extra energy, and help with sleeping trouble. The process of exploring the outdoors will introduce them to sensory stimuli in a fun way, which will help them with sensory processing issues.


Some autistic people feel much calmer and more focused if they swing for 15 minutes every day.

, Listen to them talk about it once in a while (e.g. the conversation on the car ride home can be about cats). Help them pick out books and movies from the library that feature their interests. Encouraging their passions will help build their self-esteem and focus, and teach them skills that could later result in a very successful career.


Consider this an opportunity to learn more about your child and practice your active listening skills.

, Emphasize that it is okay to talk about their interest, and they don't need to feel ashamed or afraid of doing so. Discuss moderation and flexibility as goals. Model appropriate conversation skills and help them learn to understand boundaries.


It is okay to set boundaries and say ""I'm a little tired out right now and need some alone time"" or ""I need to go do my homework now.""
You can also politely change the subject if it's been a while. For example, ""I'd like to talk about something else now. It's very nice to discuss computers with you, but I'm getting a little tired of it for now, so I'd like to change the subject. How was your day at school?""

, Some autistic children will wander off or leave the house. If you're in a crowded place like an amusement park, hold their hand or keep them in your sight. For children at home, lock the door with a deadbolt higher than they can reach.


Discuss safety in public places with them.
Talk with them about what to do if they feel upset or need you. Teach them to go to their calming down corner instead of leaving the building, and to call you or tell an adult instead of wandering off to go find you.
If they tend to wander, then consider making them a bracelet with your home address and phone number, so people can contact you if they find your child.

, Autistic people are at higher risk of developing anxiety disorders, so it's important that they feel rested and balanced. Let them engage in their special interests, read books or play with toys on the floor, run around outside, and spend time doing quiet and relaxing activities. This will help prevent meltdowns, and increase their coping skills.

, Network with therapists, teachers, and special education teachers.


If your family member is in school, talk to their teachers before the year starts, and explain their special need.
If the autistic person is afraid of a particular adult, or hates attending a specific therapy, cut contact. Some therapists use harmful restraint and seclusion tactics, silence stimming, or undermine the child's autonomy. The person's emotional health will be better if you quit right away.
If you wouldn't feel comfortable with a certain therapy being done to a non-autistic child, don't do it to an autistic child.

, Your family member can meet other autistic people and share coping strategies, while you can learn tips from other family members.


Beware of anti-autism groups, which tend to lure parents with an ideology of martyrdom and treat autism like a scourge to be eliminated. This is harmful to the child, because it treats them like a project, burden, or list of behaviors, instead of a worthwhile human being. The autistic community considers some of these groups to be hate groups, and organizes campaigns against them.

, The autism community online is a good place to start. Look up organizations run by autistic people, and autistic bloggers who share their stories. The hashtags #askanautistic and #actuallyautistic are good ways to find people on the spectrum.

, Autism is a part of who they are, and a part of who they'll always be. It comes with plenty of challenges, but also idiosyncrasies—the way they flap their hands when they're happy to see you, their openness about their thoughts, or their quirky sense of humor. Learn to see their strengths and positive traits.

, They are doing their best, and a disability does not make them an incomplete human being or a puzzle that's missing some pieces. Your unconditional love is what they need the most.

Ask him about his problems.,
Don't downplay how he's feeling.,
Talk about your own sad feelings.",How to Cheer up a Sad Child1," If your child is sad, you're probably feeling concerned. Sad children may cry, pout, act disengaged, or generally act abnormal, which can be very alarming to a parent. There are many reasons why your child might be sad, so start by asking your child about what's bothering him.


Don't shy away from talking about troubling situations. If there's a death, divorce, or separation in the family, acknowledge it and answer any questions your child might have.Some children have a hard time putting their feelings into words. Be patient, and keep asking until you get a sense of what's wrong.
If your child doesn't know how to talk about what's wrong, use a game of 20-questions (with ""warmer"" or ""colder"" responses) to narrow down what's bothering him.If you suspect you know why your child is sad, ask prompting questions to get him to talk about it. For example, you might say something like, ""It sounds like you're sad that Timmy moved away,"" or ""I bet it hurt your feelings when Billy wouldn't sit with you."";
, If your child is experiencing something troubling, it's important to make him feel that his emotions are being validated. This starts with how you initiate conversations with your child and carries through to how you respond when he tells you what's wrong.


Let your child talk about whatever is bothering him. Even if it's something that's difficult for you to tell him about, it's important that you listen and respond honestly and affectionately.Never tell a child (or anyone, for that matter) to ""snap out of it,"" ""cheer up,"" or ""pull yourself together."" Saying these things can send a message to your child that his feelings don't matter.Similarly, never tell your child that his situation ""isn't so bad"" - that may be true from your adult perspective, but to your child, feeling abandoned by his friend at lunch could be a crushing loss.
Recognize that many sad children also experience coexisting emotions, like anger or fear. Be patient and try to talk your child down if he's feeling scared or mad at someone.

, Some children may not recognize that their parents get sad from time to time. Many parents try to hide their own negative emotions to protect their children - which is healthy to do sometimes, but not to the point that your child thinks you never feel sad.


Showing or talking about your own sadness can help your child realize that he isn't alone, and that it's okay to feel sad sometimes.Tell your child that it's okay to cry, and don't be afraid to cry in front of him sometimes. Shield him or move him away from other kids so that no one calls him a ""crybaby.""
Talk about times when you've been sad, and let your child know that you cry sometimes too.

Play together.,
Take an interest in things he likes.,
Let your child act out his problems.,
Go for a walk or bike ride together.,
Give your child some alone time.,
Hug your child.,
Surprise your child with something fun.,
Try getting your child ready for bed.",How to Cheer up a Sad Child2," If your child is feeling sad, try playing with him. It will remind him that you love and care about him, and it might help take his mind off his problems.If your child still plays with toys, then join him in playing with his favorites. If he's moved on to video games, try joining him for a few levels.
Make sure your child has access to toys/activities that engage the senses. Some experts have found that playing with tactile materials, like clay, play dough, sand, rice, and even water can help sad children work through their emotions., Depending on your child's age, gender, and personality, he or she may be interested in a number of things. No matter what your child is interested in, try engaging with him in that interest. It will help him connect with you, and it might open the door to deeper, more meaningful conversations about other aspects of his life.If your kid likes comics, ask him about his favorites, or ask if you can borrow one of the comics he likes the most.
If your child is interested in cartoons or TV shows, ask if you can watch with him. This can give you a better idea of his sense of humor at his current age, which might make it easier to cheer him up when he's sad.
If your child is into sports, watch a game with him, or buy tickets to catch a game in your hometown.
No matter what your child is interested in, you should develop some degree of interest in those things too. It will help you bond, and you'll know how to engage with him the next time he's feeling down.

, This may not interest all children, but many kids want to act out or play pretend with issues they're interested in. This might be a current family issue, like a recent death, or it might be something your child is exposed to but doesn't fully understand, like church services or job responsibilities.Playing pretend is a great way for children to explore a concept in a safe, inquisitive environment.
Make sure you're supportive of your child's choice to act out what's going on. You may feel a little upset if your child is playing funeral shortly after a death in the family, but it's probably his way of trying to understand loss, death, and mourning.
Participate if your child invites you to, but give him space if he wants to play pretend alone or with other kids.

, Exercise releases endorphins that make you feel happy. This is true no matter what age you're at. If your child has been feeling sad or otherwise upset about something, try getting some light exercise together to work through stress and feel better., Sometimes children feel overwhelmed by being around other people all the time. This might even happen from being engaged with electronic devices all day long. If your child wants to sit with you, then you should let him, but make sure he has the option of spending some alone time without any electronic distractions.Don't let your child spend more than two hours a day watching TV, playing on the computer, or playing video games. That should be two hours total for any combination of electronic devices, not two hours each.
Spending some quiet time alone teaches children to be self-reliant. Over time, your child will learn how to process his emotions and relax or feel better without resorting to video games or other distractions.

, It may sound obvious, but hugs are an important way to comfort your child when he's feeling sad, stressed, or otherwise upset. Give your child a hug when he's feeling down, and don't let go until he does., Fun surprises can be a great way to help your child forget his troubles temporarily. However, you'll need to be careful so that your child doesn't come to expect gifts/surprises any time he's feeling down. You should also be careful about how often or to what extent you use distractions instead of dealing with the underlying issue, as this can be damaging for developing children.Choose a fun, easy surprise that won't cost too much. Don't recreate his birthday or Christmas, but a small gift or a fun activity can help brighten his day.
Try to save surprises for your child's worst days. Don't use them every time he's feeling down or he may avoid dealing with his problems in the future.

, A calming bedtime routine is important for children, especially if your child is going through a sad or difficult time in his life. Make sure your child gets enough sleep and has plenty of downtime to unwind before bed so that he can wake up feeling refreshed and happy.Help your child unwind and de-stress before bed. Read a book together, talk about your respective days, or have him take a warm bath.
Keep your child's room a comfortable temperature for sleep. Aim for somewhere between 65 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 to 22.22 degrees Celsius), but go with whatever is most comfortable for your child.Remember that children need more sleep than adults. A child between the ages of 5 and 12 needs 10 to 11 hours of sleep each night.

Teach your child to express emotions.,
Be consistent.,
Help your child start an inspiration journal.,
Have adventures together.,
Help him find what he's good at.,
Teach your child gratitude.,
Know when to seek help.,
Find a therapist for your child.",How to Cheer up a Sad Child3," In order for your child to be happy later in life (and in order for you to gauge your child's happiness), it's important to teach your kid to express emotions and feelings. Some children may have trouble doing this on their own, but you can work on ways to help your child identify emotions and express them accordingly.


Try having your child make a list of current feelings. Then talk about why your child feels that way, taking time to focus on each emotion/feeling.
Have your child draw his or her feelings. Drawing is a great way to express what's going on internally, especially if your child is resistant to talking about feelings or has a hard time expressing emotions.
Just like adults, some kids are simply more private and withdrawn than others. It doesn't necessarily mean there's anything wrong or being hidden from you, but check in with your child to let her know that you're there if she needs to talk., A great way to help your child feel more stable at home is by sticking to a consistent routine with your kid. Make yourself consistently available for emotional comfort, and make sure you're always supportive of your child. This may take time to develop into a consistent routine, but it's important for your child's happiness and sense of comfort.

, If your child has never journaled before, help him get started. If he already keeps a regular day-to-day journal, add an inspiration journal to his writing routine.


Having an inspiration journal can help your child learn that his experiences are important and meaningful. It can also help him get back on track when he's having a bad day in the future.An inspiration journal can be as broad or as specific as your child likes. Start out by having him write about his daily discoveries, experiences, questions, and of course, inspirations.

, Exploring new places and things together can be an excellent bonding experience. It can teach your child a new level of curiosity, as well as a new way of seeing and thinking about the world.Visit a museum together, take a dance class, or learn a new hobby together.
Take little adventures to the park, or go on a short road trip to see something exciting and interesting.
Make sure the adventures you take are interesting to your child. Ask him for input or suggestions, or run your ideas by him before you set out on the road.

, Studies have shown that ""mastery"" - the acquisition of skill and success, can be tremendously important for a developing child. It can help him feel a sense of purpose, develop goals, and feel pride over his accomplishments.If your child enjoys certain activities, like watching hockey games or dance competitions, ask him if he'd be interested in enrolling in classes or a competitive league.
Don't push your child to engage in any sports or leisure activities he doesn't enjoy. Let him decide if and when he's ready to start pursuing something in earnest.
Make sure you don't develop an overly competitive attitude towards your child's activities. Remember that your child won't win every game/competition, so focus on praising him for his efforts and telling him how well he performed.

, Gratitude extends beyond feeling grateful for physical things. It's important to teach your child to take stock of the positive experiences in his life, the loving family he's surrounded by, and the skills and hobbies he enjoys.Encourage your child to appreciate the ""little"" things, like a walk through the park on a nice day, or having a glass of his favorite juice.
Try keeping an actual chart on the wall or on your refrigerator. Have your child fill in the chart with things he loves about his family, himself, and the world around him.

, Most children experiences ups and downs from one day to the next, but some children suffer from clinical depression, behavioral problems, and trauma. If your child experiences any of the following symptoms on a regular basis, consider finding a child therapist for your son or daughter:


developmental delays (speech, language, or toilet training)
learning or attention difficulties
behavioral problems, including excessive anger/aggression, bursts of ""acting out,"" bedwetting, or eating disorders
a noticeable decline in grades and scholarly performance
frequent or recurring episodes of sadness, tearfulness, or depression
social withdrawal, isolation, and/or a decreased interest in activities that were previously enjoyed
becoming a victim of bullying, or bullying other children
insomnia
excessive sleepiness
frequent or excessive school tardiness or missed classes
unpredictable mood swings
signs of substance abuse (including alcohol, drugs, prescription medication abuse, or solvent abuse)
difficulty transitioning through changes in life

, If you believe your child might benefit from therapy, it's important to find the right therapist. In addition to therapists, you may want to consider a psychiatrist (medical doctor with training in psychotherapy and pharmacology), a clinical psychologist (therapist with a doctorate degree and advanced training in psychology), or a clinical social worker (often trained in psychotherapy, but not always--check to see what credentials are required in your state).


Start by asking your child's pediatrician for a referral or recommendation. If you don't have any luck there, you might ask a trusted friend, relative, or coworker.
You can also search online for qualified childhood therapists in your area.
Once you find a therapist you're interested in, ask her if she is willing to meet with you for a short consultation or talk on the phone. You should try to get a sense of the therapist's personality before agreeing to regular appointments.
Some therapists will charge a fee for consultations, while others will not. Find out in advance what to expect so that you are not surprised when you receive a bill.
Make sure the therapist you're considering is licensed to practice in your state. You should also look into that therapist's credentials and experience.
Find out how long the therapist has worked with children and adolescents.
Consider whether your child would like this therapist, and whether the therapist would be perceived as friendly and approachable.
Ask what types of therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, etc.) that therapist specializes in.
Check whether your health insurance plan would cover therapy appointments for your child."

Talk to a doctor.,
Look into speech therapy.,
Try exercises at home.",How to Help Hypernasal Speech in Children1," The doctor can help identify the cause of hypernasal speech, such as a cleft palate, deep pharynx, lesions on the brain, or other causes.Sometimes the child simply needs speech therapy, where in more drastic cases, surgery or prosthetics may be necessary.Early detection and treatment can help your child be understood better and blend in more with their peers.

, A speech pathologist can help you figure out how to proceed. Check with your child's school and your insurance company to see what sort of services you can get.

, There are several exercises that encourage your child to blow through their mouth in order to support their speaking abilities.

Gather a cup, a cotton ball, two straws, and arts and crafts supplies (optional).,
Place the cup upside down on a table.,
Find ways to decorate the setup as desired.,
Demonstrate the process to the child.,
Take turns blowing the cotton ball.",How to Help Hypernasal Speech in Children2," Choose straight straws, not curly ones.;
, Place a cotton ball on top of the cup. The cotton ball can be plain, or you can decorate it with colors or faces.

, You and the child could work together to decorate the cotton ball or a plastic cup. Or, try setting up a ""goal zone"" to blow the cotton ball into., Place a straw between your lips and blow the cotton ball off the cup. Offer them a try. If the child is picky about germs, let them use their own straw.

, Make it into a game and try to blow the ball in different directions.

"
"
Gather bubble solution and a bubble wand.,
Show the child how to use the bubble wand.,
Let the child take the bubble wand.,
Take turns as needed.",How to Help Hypernasal Speech in Children3," Try a wand with several openings, so that if one opening fails on a given try, the others can still produce bubbles.

, Dip the wand in solution and gently blow some bubbles. The child will most likely chase the bubbles, and you can show them how to catch them on the wand.

, Encourage them to blow their own bubbles and try to catch them (on their hands or on the wand).

, If blowing bubbles is difficult for the child, you using the wand gives them a break to refocus and keep from getting too frustrated.

"
Obtain a kazoo and teach them how to use it.,
Let your child try the kazoo.,
Try recorders and toy horns as well.",How to Help Hypernasal Speech in Children4," The kazoo should be held between the lips (not held using the teeth or with the tongue wrapped around it). Blow into it so that they know how it sounds.

, Let them play around with it. Encourage them to go upstairs or outside if it starts bothering you (or, turn on some white noise).

, These may work better for older children, or for your own peace of mind. Recorders may capture a child's interest for longer, because they can learn to play songs.

Create a calming kids-only space.,
Play calm music.,
Minimize screen time.,
Give a mini-massage.,
Speak in a calm voice.,
Remove your child from certain situations.",How to Calm Hyperactive Children1," Dedicate a corner of a room, a nook, or other small space to making a space that the child can sit in by themselves. Put pillows, stuffed animals, books or other cozy items in this space. This is not a time-out space where they go when they are in trouble. Instead, this is a space where they feel safe and can get a chance to relax., If you play music in your house, choose more soothing music like classical or meditative music, rather than upbeat pop or hard rock. Too much noise can be a trigger for some children to become hyperactive, and eliminating or changing the type of noise can be helpful in calming children.

, Too much exposure to television, video games, computers and phones can trigger hyperactivity. These devices often have rapidly moving images, bright colors and loud sounds that are the opposite of calming. Limit screen time or eliminate it altogether., Hyperactive children in particular respond well to touch and affection. Give the child a little massage on their back, feet or hands to help them calm down. Physical touch and affection can stimulate endorphins, which can be very calming and healing.

, Instead of shouting or talking loudly, reduce the volume of your voice by speaking to the child calmly. They may need to stop what they’re doing to hear you, which can help interrupt their hyperactivity.

, If there are too many people around, especially other kids who are noisy or rambunctious, this might also trigger hyperactivity in a child. Take your child out of this situation and give them some calm time on their own or just with you.

Ask the child about their friendships.,
Learn the signs that a child is being bullied.,
Talk to the child regularly.,
Avoid well-meaning, but invalidating statements.,
Keep a diary of all incidents.",How to Help Disabled Children Deal with Bullies1," Disabled children often are excited when anyone shows interest in them or wants to be their friend. This can make them a target for bullies who only want to use and exploit them.A disabled child is being bullied if a new friend conditions their friendship on the disabled child doing something they wouldn't ordinarily do. Often this entails doing something for the bully's gain. The disabled child may not realize that the person they think is their friend is really bullying them or taking advantage of them.
For example, suppose the disabled child happens to be extremely good at math. One of the other children in the class tells the disabled child, ""I'll be your friend if you'll do my math homework for me every day."" Every day, the disabled child does their own homework as well as the other child's homework. The new friend keeps adding new things the disabled child needs to do for them if they want to keep being friends, but does nothing for the disabled child in return. This is a bullying relationship.
Ask the child questions such as: What did you do at school today? Who did you play with? What games did you play? Did you enjoy those games? Would you rather have played with someone else? These and similar questions will draw out situations in which the child might have experienced bullying and not realized it.;
, When any child is being bullied, they typically will display signs of this mistreatment at home and elsewhere. While a child being physically bullied may have cuts and bruises, the signs of verbal or social bullying aren't always so obvious.For example, if the child suddenly gets upset and refuses to do something or go somewhere that they previously loved, this may be because they are being bullied there.
If you are a parent or sibling of the disabled child, you may notice more subtle signs at home, such as sudden aggression, crying, or bed wetting. While these things may happen for many reasons, they may be signs the child is being bullied.
Speak to the child if there are any sudden changes in their mood or behavior. Even if the changes are not related to bullying, you'll still have a better idea of what's going on in the child's life.

, If you want to help a disabled child deal with bullies, you need to know when the child is being bullied. It can be difficult for any child, but especially a disabled child, to tell someone when they are being bullied.Develop a close, open relationship with the child so they will feel comfortable coming to you if there is something wrong. Let them know that they can talk to you about anything, and that you won't judge them or get angry at them. Keep in mind that the child will never come to you unless they trust you.
If the child is non-verbal, it can be more difficult to discern if the child is being bullied. Encourage other forms of communication, such as drawing pictures of their day or acting things out with toys or dolls.
Focus on what the child does throughout the day, who they do those things with, and whether they enjoyed those things. If they tell you they didn't enjoy something, find out why they didn't enjoy it, and why they did it despite the fact they didn't enjoy it. Be alert to signs that someone is manipulating them or taking advantage of them.

, Be aware that common platitudes, such as ""Just ignore it. They'll get tired of it and stop eventually,"" ""This is just part of being a kid,"" or ""This will make you stronger"" can invalidate your child's experience and actually have a detrimental effect. Instead of minimizing the bullying, you need to empower your child by helping them figure out a solution.


Tell, and show, your child that they will not be alone in handling the bully. Assure them that you will be there every step of the way.
Show your child compassion, kindness, love, and support. This will help them know that you are by their side.

, When a disabled child tells you about incidents in which they are being bullied, immediately write down as many details as possible. Keep a log and encourage them to tell you every time something happens.Date each entry in your log, and ask questions so you can include as many details as possible. Record everything the child remembers, even if it seems irrelevant to you. If the child is non-verbal, include any drawings or a description of the child's communications with you.
Every time your child describes a bullying incident, contact the school and provide a full report. You can use a template letter (like the one here: http://www.pacer.org/publications/bullypdf/BP-19.pdf) to write a formal letter to the school. Keep a copy of your letter, and make sure you contact the school after each and every incident.
If you need to take additional action later on, it will be helpful to have this record of events. Memories can fade with time, so you want to make a record of the incident as soon as possible after it happens.

Help your child burn off energy.,
Do calm activities.,
Spend time in natural settings.,
Distract the child with another activity.,
Use guided imagery and meditation.,
Practice breathing techniques.,
Practice kids’ yoga or tai chi.,
Give your child a journal to write in.",How to Calm Hyperactive Children2," Help the child get some exercise by going for a walk, riding bikes, or going to a park. All kids get built-up energy that needs an outlet, and it may be particularly the case for a hyperactive child. Getting fresh air and a change of scenery can be really useful in redirecting a child’s disposition.


Find a sport that the child enjoys doing. Do not pressure them to do a sport they don’t like, as this can increase their hyperactivity and lack of focus.

, Give your child a chance to take a breath and relax by reading a book with them or singing a soft song. Giving them a warm bath is also a good idea.Add lavender essential oils to the bath to create a calming scent.

, Nature can have a calming effect on people, even if it’s just spending time in the yard or garden. Taking a walk or hike in a forest can also be very beneficial, as the child will get fresh air, exercise, and a chance to clear their heads., If there is an activity that seems to trigger your child’s hyperactivity, such as something that is noisy, frustrating, too chaotic, and so on, redirect their attention to another activity. This can help refocus their attention.

, Meditating is, for any age, a good way to calm the mind and body. When children are unable to handle thinking about stressful situations, you can help them visualize how they can respond in those situations. This can help calm them down. Search online for examples of these, or find a book at your local library on meditation and guided imagery for children.For example, have the child sit and close their eyes. Ask them to imagine a calm space, like a beach or a forest. Have them pay attention to the sounds that they hear, the wind they feel on their face, and the details they see around them. Using a regular imagined calming space can be helpful.

, Teach your child how to take deep breaths to relax. Take a deep breath in through the nose and slowly breathe out through the mouth. Focus on different parts of the body while taking these deep breaths.For example, have your child think about their legs while breathing deeply and rhythmically. Have them tighten up their leg muscles when they inhale, and relax those muscles with every exhale. Go through different parts of the body until the entire body is relaxed.
Have your child imagine a warm color or light that surrounds them as they breathe. Imagine this color or light wraps them up to calm them down.

, Calming meditative practices like yoga and tai chi are not just good for adults. They help kids get centered and find balance in their lives. Find a DVD at your local library that guides kids through yoga or tai chi. Similarly, search online for one.

, If the child is old enough to write, give them a notebook or journal to write their feelings in. They can write a page or two every day, jotting down their thoughts, problems and concerns. They can either keep the page intact or crumple it up and throw it away.


Do not read your child’s journal. They should feel that they can be totally honest in their journal, and respecting their privacy will help them feel safe enough to write what is really on their mind.

Establish a daily schedule.,
Eat meals together.,
Encourage healthy sleep habits.",How to Calm Hyperactive Children3," Kids thrive on routine, and knowing what activities will be happening in the day can help give them a sense of stability. This doesn’t mean you need to schedule every moment of the day, but you should have meals at regular times, homework time after school, bath time before bed, and so on.

, Sit down together with your child to eat meals. This gives the child a chance to eat good food while having your attention. Model healthy eating habits for your child.


Do not bring screen media to the table. Turn off the TV, computer and phone while eating meals together.

, Younger children need 10-12 hours of sleep every night, while teenagers need 8-9 hours of sleep.Make sure the child goes to bed at a reasonable hour and gets a full, uninterrupted night of sleep.


Limit use screen media (TV, computer, video games), especially before bedtime. This can disrupt sleep patterns."
"
Serve a healthy breakfast.,
Determine if there are any food allergies.,
Serve lots of vegetables and fruits.,
Keep your child hydrated.",How to Calm Hyperactive Children4," Give your child a good start to the day with protein and whole grains. Serve eggs or peanut butter on toast. Stay away from sugary cereals, white bread, and other refined carbohydrates and sugars, which may contribute to blood sugar imbalances.

, Food allergies have the potential to cause behavioral problems. Eliminate certain foods to see if your child is allergic or sensitive to them. Start with eliminating some of the most common food allergens, such as wheat, dairy, eggs, corn, shellfish or peanuts. Track how your child feels and behaves as each of these foods is eliminated and then reintroduced into their diet., Leafy green vegetables are rich with vitamins and give good nutrients to your child. Many of these also have omega 3 acids, which can help with hyperactivity. Fruits can be a good alternative to sweets that contain refined sugar., Be sure that your child drinks a good amount of water every day. This will help your child feel better overall, along with helping to flush their body of toxins. Serve plain water instead of sodas or fruit juices.

"
"
Use essential oils.,
Have your child drink calming teas.,
Take nutritional supplements.",How to Calm Hyperactive Children5," Essential oils are derived from plants and can be added to warm baths or an aromatherapy diffuser to give out a calming scent.Some essential oils that are particularly good for hyperactivity include lavender, peppermint, and orange.


Put a few drops into a handkerchief and have your child breathe in the scent to help calm them down.

, There are many natural herbs that have calming properties, such as chamomile, catnip, and peppermint can be calming. Be careful not to give them really hot tea, especially if they are young.

, Some people with hyperactivity may have a deficiency of calcium or magnesium. These nutrients aid in muscle relaxation and sleep. Give your child supplements from a natural health foods store. Be sure to read instructions on the label to ensure you are giving them appropriate doses of supplements."
"
Help build the child's confidence and self-esteem.,
Remain calm.,
Use drawings or social stories.,
Help the child improve their social skills.,
Look for opportunities for the child to make friends.",How to Help Disabled Children Deal with Bullies2," Disabled children who understand that they are valuable and have many strengths and talents will be less vulnerable to bullies. Focus on the child's skills and the positive contributions they make.Teach the child that although they are different from other people in many ways, those differences do not mean that they are not as good as others, or that they are not worthy of love and respect.
Building the child's confidence also entails talking to them about the fact that some people can be mean or cruel. Explain that these people are insecure and need to put others down in order to feel good about themselves.
Help the child identify things that they like about themselves, and encourage them to do nice things for themselves each day, or find something that makes them happy.
Remind your child that they are important, special, strong, and very much loved.

, When a disabled child tells you that they are being bullied, you must let your own emotions go. While it's natural to feel angry or frustrated, expressing that anger in front of the child may upset them more.Keep in mind that most children are reluctant to tell anyone that they are being bullied because they fear an angry reaction, or that they will be blamed for the behavior. The best thing you can do is be warm and supportive to the child.
This doesn't mean you should bottle up your feelings, but save your anger for later. If the disabled child sees you angry, they may misinterpret your anger and believe you are angry at them. Remember that children are like sponges and absorb everything within their environment — your reaction can have a major impact on how they learn to deal with stressful and intense situations.

, If the child is non-verbal or has intellectual disabilities, drawings and social stories can help them understand bullying behavior. They need to know how to recognize it and how to respond to it if it happens to them.Keep in mind that disabled children are more likely to be bullied. They need to learn coping strategies before it happens. This doesn't mean you assume the child will be bullied – it simply means that you make sure they are prepared if they are. With a social story, you want to insert the child directly into the story so they understand what to do if they encounter a bully.
For example, you might create a story in which someone says they will be the child's friend if the child does their math homework for them. Assume the child's name is Taylor. The story would go ""My name is Taylor. This is my school. At school I study math. I enjoy math and I am very good at it. A student in my school is Tommy. He is not good at math. One day Tommy says that he will be my friend, but only if I do his math homework for him. I tell Tommy I do not need his friendship, and I will not do his math homework for him. When I come home from school, I tell my mother what Tommy has said to me.""

, If the child has delayed social development, they may be more vulnerable to bullies because they lack the skills to interpret certain behaviors or ways of speaking. Teaching the child about social interaction can help them understand how to deal with bullies.For example, you can use pictures of people with different facial expressions to teach the child to recognize when someone is being sarcastic or insincere.
Teach the child directly with examples how to identify threatening or bullying body language, and how to interpret various tones of voice.

, If the child has a circle of friends who love and respect them, they are less likely to be bullied. When a bully approaches, friends who are around can stand up for the child and protect them.Friendships often are formed based on mutual interests. Find out areas in which the child has talent, or has special interest, and look for groups related to that area. For example, if the child really enjoys science, you might find a science club the child can join.
Building friendships will also improve the child's confidence and self-esteem, making them less vulnerable to bullies. Remember that bullies typically pick on someone they perceive as an easy target. If the child has a lot of friends around them, they won't be seen that way.
Disabled children often become the target of more subtle bullies who will use emotional manipulation and conditional friendships to exploit them. If the child already has several good friends, they'll be less susceptible to this kind of bullying because they won't be desperate for friendship or companionship.

"
"
Teach the child avoidance strategies.,
Get a map of the school.,
Utilize your child's Individualized Educational Program (IEP).,
Identify a named person to whom the child can report.,
Request a copy of the school handbook.,
Communicate with the school in writing.,
Be open to further action if the bullying doesn't stop.",How to Help Disabled Children Deal with Bullies3," Disabled children are more vulnerable to bullies when they are alone, or when they are far away from adults or authority figures. The child can avoid bullies if they know to stick close to teachers or other adults, and limit times when they are alone.This can be difficult if the child needs or prefers to be alone, or doesn't have a lot of friends with whom they normally socialize. If the child is not particularly social, you may need to help the child develop other strategies. For example, if the child normally eats alone, arrange for them to eat in a teacher's classroom or other protected space rather than eating alone in the lunchroom.
Speak to adults and teachers who work with the child on a regular basis and explain the situation to get their help and support. For example, if the child normally rides the bus to school, you might talk to the bus driver and explain that the child needs to sit in the seat directly behind the bus driver so they will be more protected from bullies.

, Often, bullying is a matter of opportunity. A bully may not seek the disabled child out if they no longer frequent areas where the bully typically hangs out. A map of the school (or other place where the child is being bullied) can help you identify those places.Print out the map, and have the child color in areas where they feel safe and areas where they don't. You might have the child color safe areas green and unsafe areas (or areas where they've previously encountered bullies) red.
Once you've identified danger areas, you can work with the child to plan a route to places they need to go that avoids those unsafe areas.
If avoidance is not possible, talk to adults or to trusted friends and make sure that when the child is in that area, they have an escort and don't have to be alone.

, If your child has a disability, they may be eligible for special education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). You and a team of educators will form their IEP team, which can be an extremely helpful tool to counter bullying. Strategies may include allowing the child to leave class early to avoid bullying in the halls, educating peers on bullying policies, educating peers and teachers on the disability, shadowing from school staff, and so on.Discuss the bullying during an IEP meeting and work with the team to make sure your child feels safe and is protected from the bullying.

, A network of trusted adults who support the child can help them deal with bullies. The child should have at least one person they know they can go to, but ideally there should be several.Talk to the child and find out which adults that child trusts and is comfortable talking to. For example, the child may not have developed a rapport with their current teacher, but may be very close to their second grade teacher. Talk to that teacher and find out if they are willing to be a person that child can count on if they get in a situation where they are being bullied.
It isn't enough simply to tell the child to tell their teacher, or to tell a school administrator. If the child doesn't feel comfortable with that person, they won't go to them for help. If you want to help the child deal with bullies, you need to find out who they trust. That person may not be someone who has any real authority, but they can go to someone who does and speak on the child's behalf.

, If the bullying is happening at school, get a copy of the school's anti-bullying policy and any other disciplinary codes that are related to the behavior the child is experiencing.Mark down the provisions of the handbook that apply to the child's situation. In the event that you report the bullying to the school, you will need to reference these provisions.
Understanding the policy also gives you an idea of what you will need to show authorities in order for them to take action against the bullying. As you enter incidents into your log, you can use these policies to outline the information.
The school handbook also will give you the direct contact information for the person to whom you need to report. Not reporting the bullying to the right person can result in delayed action or even no action being taken at all.

, If things get to the point that you need to contact the school to get something done to protect the child, write a letter rather than making a phone call. You need to keep a record of all interactions related to this situation.In your letter, identify yourself and the reason you are writing. Describe the incidents of bullying using as many details as possible, including dates and times. Then, list the specific sections of the school anti-bullying or disciplinary policy that you believe the behavior violates.
State specifically the result you want. You may want to talk to the child about this. For example, if the child is being bullied at lunchtime, you and the child may agree that the child should be permitted to eat their lunch in their favorite teacher's classroom.
Sign and date your letter, and make a copy for your own records before you deliver it to the appropriate person at the school. While you can deliver the letter in person, it may be better to mail it using a service that provides you with proof that the letter has been received. You may need that proof if you anticipate that the school won't do anything and that you'll have to take further action to resolve the situation.

, In many cases, the school is able to resolve the situation and protect the child. However, sometimes you will face administrators whose response is inadequate.While you should hope for the best outcome when you initially notify the school of the problem, you also should plan for the worst. If the bullying continues despite your efforts, the child may need to be transferred to another school, or (if you are the child's parent) you may have to take legal action.
If school officials dismiss your complaints, or don't take the problem seriously, talk to an attorney who specializes in disability rights law. They will be able to help you evaluate your options and decide what you want to do to protect the child.

Establish consistent daily routines.,
Create an enabling environment.,
Create a reactive environment for infants and small children.,
Use your hands to share experiences.,
Teach your child ordinary skills.,
Find a school where your child can flourish.,
Get good medical care.",How to Help a Deaf‐Blind Child1," Because deaf-blind children cannot see or hear things, they need tactile cues and consistent schedules so that they may anticipate the activities that make up their life. Try to start every day with the same routine, eat meals around the same time, and follow a similar sequence when undergoing common rituals.Stick to your sequences. For instance, you may naturally feed your child lunch, play with them, and then put them down for a nap. Try to stick to this so that your child knows what's happening based on what has happened before.
Design your sequences to have clear beginnings and ends. For instance, you might always open the toy chest to play, and close it up to end playtime.;
, Set up your child's room and other spaces so that they are accessible to your child. Give your child control over their environment. Once you have set up your child's room, your child should be able to adjust it to their liking.Let your child decorate their room, picking out their own curtains and lamps based on what they like to touch.
If your child has some sight, lighting and colors are very important. Rooms should be well lit, but without glare. Important items should be bright and contrast with the background, and clutter should be avoided.Older children should clean their own rooms.

, Give your infant a play space that they can manipulate and that will react to their movements. Consider a water play mat, or low-hanging mobiles your baby can easily reach.Get interactive toys, such as toys that vibrate, make noise within your child's range of hearing, can be manipulated and altered by your child, or have textures that your child can enjoy.

, You may put your hand gently under your child's, or place your child's hand on your hand, to show your child that you see what they are doing, and teach them what you are doing as well. When they are playing with a toy, you might gently put a hand under their hand that is on the toy, or play at passing it back and forth. When you are eating, show your child that you are also eating by briefly placing their hand on your hand or jaw.Your child will learn to reach for your hand when they want to know what you are doing, or to ask questions about their environment.

, Your child should learn ordinary life skills to the best of their ability. Allow your child to shadow you while you complete household tasks, and guide them physically through the process of making food, doing laundry, and cleaning.

Your child may benefit from an in-home aide.

, While some deaf-blind children may require a school for deaf, blind, and deaf-blind children, the majority attend local public schools in integrated classrooms.They may require the help of technology and perhaps a one-on-one aide. Children with some level of hearing or vision may use microphones and large-print text in an integrated classroom. They may be able to work with an interpreter.

Most deaf-blind children have other physical and cognitive differences that will inform their education.Check out educational programs and resources for deaf-blind children and their teachers in the United States: https://nationaldb.org/library/page/657


, To the best of your ability, get your child a medical care team that includes specialists in deafness and blindness. Bring your child in for regular check-ups, and ask your doctor about educational resources and advances in technology that may benefit your child.

Ask your doctor about cochlear implants to allow your child to hear.
Apply for government financial aid.

Set a firm bedtime.,
Create a sleep routine.,
Practice relaxation techniques with your child.,
Cut back on daytime naps.,
Try a reward system for cooperation.",How to Help Children with ADHD Sleep Better1," A good way to help your child with ADHD sleep better is to get him in the habit of going to bed at the same time. Pick a realistic bed time for your child's schedule and your family activities. Make this your child's bedtime is the same time every night, even on the weekend.


To help your child stick to this bedtime, remind your child it's time for bed starting at an hour before. This will give your child an indication that it is time to start winding down his or her day.
You can remind your child do this by telling him or her that bed time is coming in 15 minute increments. You can also set up a timer which reminds your child every 15 minutes, so that he or she can see those minutes ticking away.;
, During the hour before your child goes to bed, create a list of activities that focuses your child on sleeping and bedtime. This can be when your child takes a bath, brushes his or her teeth, reads, gets clothes picked out clothes for the next day, or does any low-key activity.


Make sure your child does not listen to loud music, play video games, have computer time, watch TV time, or engage in any rough play time.
Your kid should only take part in quiet conversations., A good way to help your child fall asleep better is helping him or her to relax before bed. This may be deep breathing techniques, muscle relaxation, and positive visualization.


You can also try a foot rub or other calming massage for your child to provide relaxation., In order for your child to want to sleep more at night, you need to make sure he or she doesn't sleep too much during the day. If your child is younger, he or she will likely need a small nap every day. However, if your child is older, napping for hours can cause interruptions to his or her sleep patterns.


If you older child must have a nap, restrict it to a power nap of 20 or 30 minutes., If your child is having a hard time complying with your bedtime rules, try setting up a reward system. Give your child a token for each activity he or she does without problem. Once your child amasses a certain number of tokens, give him or her time to do certain activities.


These activities can be time on the computer, time to play video games, a helping of a favorite food or dessert, or extra outside play time."
"
Establish a feature that signals to the child who you are.,
Give cues before interacting.,
Respond to their cues.,
Get permission.",How to Help a Deaf‐Blind Child2," Identify yourself to the child by directing their attention to an aspect of yours that is consistent. For instance, if you have long hair you might brush your child's hand with it, or if you always wear a ring you can let the child feel for your ring.There can be a sign that you make to tell the child it's you, but it's also helpful to direct the child's attention to an identifying feature that they can find on their own, in case you forget to give them your name-sign.

, A child may become disheartened or fail to learn active engagement if they are approached randomly and given no warning of what is to come.You might always pat them in the same place when you are going to interact with them, or always tug on whatever object you are about to adjust (i.e. changing a diaper, putting on a bib, helping a child untie shoes, etc).
Let them know when you are going to lift or otherwise touch them. It's respectful to identify yourself and give a preliminary touch before you interact with an infant or a child who is deaf-blind.
If you constantly pick up or manipulate a child without warning, you will train them to feel helpless.

, A deaf-blind child may struggle to communicate, especially in early childhood or with those who do not understand tactile signing. Pay attention to the child to understand when they are signaling interest, when they need a break, or when they are trying to get your attention. A child may grab your hand to participate in what you are doing, go and sit by the door if they want to go out, or turn their head away if they are tired of a game you are playing with them., You will frustrate and overwhelm older children if you do not know how to ask them for permission. Make sure you understand how they say ""yes"" and ""no."" Before you interact with a child, identify yourself with your sign and alert them as to what you are about to do. If they have any choice about it at all, ask them for a yes or a no.

If they are too young to say yes or no, try to read their body language. A child who is turning their head away or fussing might need you to slow down or stop what you are doing. A child who is kicking their legs, burbling, or otherwise showing signs of positive engagement may enjoy the activity.

"
"
Volunteer.,
Advocate for accessibility.,
Educate your children.",How to Help a Deaf‐Blind Child3," Ask local hospitals, community centers, and religious centers for volunteer opportunities. You may be able to join deaf-blind children in playtime, provide accessibility support during field trips, or provide transportation. Integrated classrooms and schools for the Blind or for the Deaf in your area may also accept tutor-volunteers.

Fundraise. Donate money and raise funds for Deaf and Blind schools, schools with integrated classrooms, and organizations that help families of deaf-blind children. Consider organizing a bake sale, creating a GoFundMe campaign, or organizing a fun run to raise money.
Consider learning tactile sign language if you are interested in helping deaf-blind children without residual hearing or much sight.

, Say something if you notice that your local schools, public parks, and local businesses doe not comply with basic accessibility guidelines. For example, does your community have accessible crosswalks, with walk signs that vibrate and sound?Write principals, business owners about accessibility issues in privates spaces. For public spaces, consider joining a planning committee, or writing an open letter in the local paper pointing out the problems.
When you are planning events, think about ways to make them accessible. Is your venue well-lit and free from ambient noise? Is signage available in Braille? Are there ramps and floor space for wheelchairs, which are used by many deaf-blind children?
Emails to families that include deaf-blind children should be sent as text, rather than images of text, so that children with residual hearing can listen to them as speech.
Marches and protests are more accessible if they include interpreters, areas to sit, even terrain, and volunteers who look out for those in need of assistance.

, Teach your own children about disability and what that might mean for their peers. Teach them what words are acceptable and what are considered impolite. Encourage them to exhibit empathy and respect.

You might teach children that it is appropriate to ask some questions when you are friends with someone, but that they shouldn't point or make jokes about another child's disability.
Teach your children to avoid ableist put-downs like ""lame"" and ""retarded.""
Make a play-date. If your child has a classmate who is deaf-blind, ask your child if you can organize a play date for them. Go over expectations ahead of time, and make sure to communicate beforehand with the child's parents.

Keep your child's room dark.,
Cut down on visual distractions.,
Try calming sounds.,
Buy comfortable sleeping materials.,
Help your child return to bed.,
Avoid strenuous waking routines.",How to Help Children with ADHD Sleep Better2," Light in your child's room can be distracting and make it hard to sleep. Try to eliminate any extra light in your child's room. Get a clock that only shows the time when a button is pressed, use blackout curtain to reduce atmospheric light, and don't have a night light. If these methods do not work, see if a sleep mask can help keep out any unwanted light.


You can even try moving your child's bed away from the door so the light that filters under it doesn't bother your child. , When your child has ADHD, he or she will likely be easily distracted by objects in his or her bedroom. In order to cut down on this, don't let your child have a TV, video gaming system, computer, or other electronic that can be used as a distraction.


Move your child's toys to another room so he or she will not be tempted to play with them instead of sleeping., When you child is trying to sleep, he or she may be distracted by normal sounds in your house. To help avoid this, try playing calming sounds for your child, such as raindrops, ocean waves, or other nature sounds while your child sleeps. This will help block these noises out and calm your child down.You can also try classical or other calming instrumental music.

, You child needs as few distractions while sleeping as possible. This means that your child needs comfortable sleep clothes and bed covers. Buy comfortable cotton sleep clothes that your child is comfortable in. Also make sure your child's sheets and comforter are comfortable.


Make sure your child isn't too hot or cold while sleeping. Switch your child's sleep clothing with the season to make sure his or her temperature is regulated.
Also get rid of annoying or itchy tags or other parts of clothing that may distract your child from sleep., Even with all the different methods to help your child go straight to sleep, he or she may still get up. When this happens, avoid yelling, getting angry, or lecturing him or her. This will only stimulate your child and make it harder for him or her to go back to bed., In addition to sleeping calmly, you need to make sure you wake your child up calmly as well. Do not shake, call out loudly, shout at your child, or pound on the door. This will only make your child jolt awake and start him or her out on the wrong foot.Also make sure you give your child enough time to wake up because he or she may get distracted while waking up.

Try lavender and chamomile.,
Try melatonin.,
Ask your pediatrician about medication side effects.,
Avoid sleeping pills.",How to Help Children with ADHD Sleep Better3," There are two different herbs that can help your child get to sleep. Lavender and chamomile have been shown to help reduce insomnia.You can try lavender aroma therapy, such as candles or essential oils. You can also try lavender or chamomile tea earlier in the day to help your child sleep.


You can also try adding a lavender sachet near your child’s pillow. The lavender has a lovely scent and also has been shown to help get kids to fall and stay asleep.Avoid giving your child too much tea too close to bedtime. You don't want your child to interrupt his or her sleep to go to the bathroom.

, Consider supplementing your child's sleep routine changes with melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone created by the body to help it sleep. You can buy it in supplement form over the counter and give it to your child before bed.Talk to the pediatrician before you give anything to your child to find the best dose.

, There is a possibility that your child's medication, either for ADHD or other disorder, is causing insomnia. If you notice that your child's sleep routine will not level out despite your best efforts, ask you child's pediatrician about this side effect.

The pediatrician may be able to adjust dosage or find an alternative medication that won't cause this.

, Sleeping pills are not good for your child's sleep routine. This will only cause your child to become dependent on them to sleep when he or she should instead be learning to sleep on his or her own.


Sleeping medications have also not been adequately tested on children, so you don't want your child to rely on them."

Check that the daycare is clean and well stocked.,
Ask about the playing style at the daycare.,
Find out about the food and diapering policies.,
Ask about the training and expertise of the staff.,
Determine if the daycare is a good fit for you and your child.",How to Check Out a Gym Daycare," One way you can locate a gym daycare is to inquire if your regular gym has daycare services. Perhaps they have a daycare area in the back that you never noticed before. Or maybe they recently expanded to include a daycare for their clients. Speak to a representative at your local gym to see if you can place your child in a daycare there.Finding a daycare at your local gym can be a convenient option as you will not have to adjust much of your workout routine and you can stick to a gym that you are comfortable with. Your local gym may also be close to your home, making it easier to get there and back with your child when you want to work out.;
, You can also try doing an online search that is location specific, such as “gym daycare in Boston” or “gym daycare in Seattle downtown.” There are many gym daycares listed online based on your area or state. Do a search and find a few options close to you that you can then check out.You can also search chain gyms, such as 24 hour fitness, to see if they offer daycare services at a location in your area. Many chain gyms have daycare services for their clients., Reach out to other parents at your gym or in your circle of friends and ask them if they have used daycare services at a gym before. Talk to them about good gym daycares they have used in the area. Get a reference for a good gym daycare from them.


You can also compare details like pricing and quality of service of certain daycares with other parents. For example, you may ask, “Which gym daycares are the most affordable? Which gym daycares offer the best services?”

, Most daycares will have a minimum age for children and/or a maximum age. For example, some daycares may not take children younger than two or older than ten. Contact the daycare and ask them if they have age requirements for the children they take.For example, some daycares may only take children that are at an age where they are toilet-trained. Some gyms only take in younger children based on the training and capabilities of their staff.

, You should also find out when the daycare is open so you can determine if it fits into your schedule. You may have a specific time in your schedule when you workout and want to be sure the daycare will be open during these times. Look for the daycare hours on the gym’s website or call them to find out this information.You should also inquire if there is a limit on the time a child can stay in the daycare and if you have to book a spot for your child in advance.
Some daycares work on a first-come, first-serve basis. If this is the case, you should make sure the daycare will have enough staff during the times you plan to workout so you can drop off your child.

, You should also make sure the daycare fits into your budget and is affordable. Find out if the daycare service is included in your gym membership or it if costs extra. Some gyms may charge a few dollars an hour for daycare or a flat rate for a certain number of hours.You should weigh the cost of the daycare with the cost of having a sitter watch your kids at home. If the daycare is more affordable, you may opt for the gym daycare so you do not need to pay more for a private sitter.

, To determine if the gym daycare is the right fit, you may decide to bring your child with you on a trial visit to the daycare. Call the daycare ahead of time and find out if it is okay for you to bring your child in for a trial visit. Having your child with you can help to ensure your child is as comfortable with the daycare environment as you are.


If you’d rather not worry about your child during the visit, feel free to check out the daycare on your own. Once you feel the daycare is a fit, you may then decide to bring your child to the daycare.

, Pay attention to the level of cleanliness in the daycare. Ask yourself several questions when you visit, including: Are the floors and windows clean? Do the toys provided look clean and in good condition? Are any climbing or jumping areas well padded and maintained?You should also ask a representative at the daycare how old the daycare is and how old the facility is as a whole. You should make sure the daycare is structurally sound and does not pose a threat to your child.

, Find out if the daycare encourages free play, where the children are allowed to play with toys as they see fit or if the daycare offers more structured activities. Maybe the daycare does educational play with children over a certain age. Inquire about the level of play offered at the daycare.


You should also pay attention to the types of toys offered to the children. Are the toys educational and engaging? You may not want to put your child in a daycare that only seems to have television as a form of entertainment.

, You should also inquire about whether children are allowed to bring outside food into the daycare, such as packaged snacks that you prepare in advance, or if they will be given snacks as part of their care. If they are given snacks, make sure you know what kind of snacks will be offered. If your child has any allergies, you should let the daycare know so they do not serve food that could put your child in danger.


You should also find out if the staff will be able to change your child's diapers if necessary. Ask if they have a changing area and if they are comfortable changing diapers.

, Ask questions about how many staff are present at one time in the daycare as well as the level of experience of the staff. Find out if the staff have passed background checks and are trained in CPR. Confirm that the staff have experience in child development and childcare.Notice if there is enough staff to take care of the amount of children in the daycare. The smaller the number of children in the facility, the better. There should be no more than three to four infants and toddlers per adult staff member, or six to ten kids that are three to five years old per adult staff member.
Ask how the daycare determines how many staff members to have at one time. You may ask, “Do you have staff on call if there is a large number of kids in the daycare at one time? Do you turn children away if there is not enough staff? Does your staff play with the children?”

, Once you have checked out the daycare on your own or with your child, determine if its a good fit. Factor in the gym facilities as well as the daycare facilities. Think about whether you would feel comfortable letting your child stay in the daycare while you work out.


If your child came with you on the visit, ask them for their opinion. Gauge if they seem comfortable and at ease in the daycare. You may ask your child, “What did you think of that daycare? Did you have a good time? Would you want to play there again?”

Teach your children the rules of your household (and those you want them to abide by).,
Read.,
Be a good example to your children.,
Teach them to be healthy and widen their tastes.,
Love and respect your children.,
Never go by the saying ""If you want to act like a child, I'll treat you like one"".,
Educate them.,
Let them be themselves.,
Make older siblings feel involved in the younger siblings lives.",How to Bring Up Good Children," It may sound harsh, but you must bring boundaries into the house and do it early, because then they will be less upset when you punish them. Physical punishments are illegal in some locations and many people, including child care experts, don't believe in slapping children. Look into punishments and behaviour adjustment techniques such as the naughty-steps method, scoldings and the warning-warning-punishment technique.;
, Read to your children and with your children. Do not let them get used to watching TV all day. Read them to sleep, and also give them educational books that teach them to read and write themselves.

, Whilst your offspring are obviously not simian in nature, to a greater or lesser degree, monkey see-monkey do. You should not do something that you wish your children not to do, even when they are not in your presence.

, Feed your children with fruit and vegetables, of as many different varieties as you can. This will, possibly, help to make them good children. Teach them to brush. Good children have brushed teeth, brushed hair and brushed other things. You should widen their taste to different foods but don't force your child to eat things they don't enjoy the taste off.

, As your child gets older they want more respect and privacy but at the same time they deep-down want your love. Learn to respect and give them a more mature love that doesn't involve kissing.

, It doesn't work and only ends up with older children getting angrier.

, You should be asking them what they did in school today, what they enjoy and don't and especially what they find difficult.

, Don't choose their bedroom layout for them, or tell them what jobs they can't and can do, it makes them feel useless and annoyed, and they may also be afraid they will upset you.

, Older siblings should not be left out or be made to feel like they must be an example. Let older siblings feel involved in younger siblings being brought up- but don't shove the responsibility of being a parent on them.

Wash your child’s hands.,
Wash hands before eating and interaction.,
Ask the daycare provider to wash your child’s hands.",How to Avoid Daycare Germs1," As soon as your child comes home from daycare, you should have them wash their hands. This ensures that they are not bringing home any unwanted germs.If you have the time, you can wash your child’s hands at the daycare before they leave so you are not even bringing them in the car.;
, Another way to decrease the spread of germs is to make your child wash their hands before they eat. This can help decrease the likelihood of germs getting in your child’s mouth and on their food.You should also get your child to wash their hands before they interact with their siblings or friends. Your child could accidentally spread germs to others through contact.

, Another thing you can do is ask that your daycare provider help your child wash their hands before they eat. This is important since germs get on your child’s hands and then they put them in their mouth.If your child is old enough, tell them to wash their hands before eating to help reduce germs, and teach them proper hand washing technique. Teach them to use running water, lather their hands well with soap, scrub their hands for at least 20 seconds (about the amount of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday two times), rinse their hands with running water, and then dry their hands with a clean towel."

Choose a toddler-friendly camping destination.,
Introduce your toddler to camping by creating a mock campsite in your backyard.,
Perform a variety of outdoors activities with your toddler.",How to Camp with Toddlers1," Campsites that may appeal to your toddler and keep them entertained are areas that contain plenty of wildlife; such as trees, insects, and other natural elements your toddler may find interesting.


Select a camping location that poses minimal danger risks; such as campsites away from steep cliffs or rivers that contain strong currents.;
, By pretending as if you are truly camping in the wilderness, you can prepare both you and your toddler for the camping trip in terms of familiarity and what to expect.

, This will help prepare your toddler for spending an ample amount of time outdoors during your camping trip. Examples of activities you can perform with your toddler are short hikes or fishing trips.

Change clothes when you get home.,
Choose a daycare with a sick-child policy.,
Ensure that your child’s daycare has high cleanliness standards.,
Teach your child to use tissues.",How to Avoid Daycare Germs2," As soon as your child gets home, take off their daycare clothes and put them in the wash. If you had extended contact with your child or other children at daycare, you should also put yours into the wash.This helps remove any germs clinging to your child’s clothes and keeps them from spreading around your home.

, Many daycares have strict rules about children coming to daycare sick, while others are more lenient. If possible, choose a daycare that does not allow children to come if they have a fever over 101 degrees Fahrenheit, a cold, diarrhea, vomiting, sore throat, or pink eye.This means you should also keep your own child at home or out of daycare when they are sick.

, When choosing a daycare, make a checklist to ensure that the standards for cleanliness are high. This protects your child from getting sick unnecessarily.Make sure there are handwashing procedures for the kids and that hygiene habits are taught and enforced.
Ask whether or not the toys are cleaned daily, and how they disinfect them to prevent germs.
Ask the staff about the diaper changing procedures. They should wear gloves and have an area to change diapers away from the other children and any food.

, Many children pick their noses. By digging into their nose, they are getting germs on their hands that can be spread. If they already have germs on their hands, by sticking them in their nose, they are putting themselves at risk to get sick.Help teach your child to use a tissue and keep their fingers out of their nose.
Try to also instruct your child to sneeze or cough into their elbow.

Feed your family a nutritious diet.,
Feed your child immune system boosting foods.,
Make sure everyone gets plenty of rest.",How to Avoid Daycare Germs3," Eating healthy, nutritious food helps boost your family’s immune system. This can help them be more able to fight off germs they come into contact with. A weak immune system from unhealthy eating can make your child more prone to getting sick.Make sure your child eats nutritious foods. This includes adding fruits, vegetables, and lean protein to every meal. You should provide healthy snacks, like apples and peanut butter, grapes and low fat cheese, or trail mix made with raisins, nuts, and dark chocolate. Get rid of sugary and junk food, like french fries and fried meats, cakes, cookies, donut, white pasta, and white bread.

, In addition to a healthy balanced diet, you may want to give your child foods or supplements that support immune system health. Feed your child foods full of vitamin C, zinc, and vitamin D. You can also give your child probiotics.Vitamin C can be found in apples, pineapple, citrus fruit, asparagus, broccoli, strawberries, spinach, leafy greens, and tomatoes.Good sources of zinc include seafood like crab and lobster, grassfed beef, pork chops, chicken, pumpkin seeds, spinach, nuts, chickpeas, dark chocolate, and white mushrooms. Many fortified foods also have zinc.Vitamin D can be found in food sources like fish, eggs, and cheese. Fortified dairy and grain products also contain vitamin D. The best source of vitamin D is 15 minutes of sunshine.
Talk to your pediatrician before giving any supplements to your child.

, Proper rest also helps support a strong immune system. By making sure your child gets plenty of sleep each night, you are helping to make their immune system strong so it can protect against germs.Toddlers need roughly nine to 14 hours, preschoolers need eight to 13 hours, and school-aged children need eight to 11."

Pack sunscreen and insect repellent to use on your toddler.,
Pack extra toilet paper and wet wipes.,
Bring non-perishable snacks for your toddler to eat throughout the day.,
Pack family-appropriate camping gear.",How to Camp with Toddlers2," Examples of toys you should bring are plastic shovels and buckets, balls, or a can of bubbles and a bubble wand.


Bring waterproof toys or those that you don't mind getting dirty, that are fairly large in size. In most cases, toys that you bring camping may easily become lost, wet, or extremely dirty.

, A favorite blanket or stuffed animal can prevent your toddler from feeling homesick or uncomfortable while spending time away from home.

, Your toddler may become cold, wet, or dirty several times per day on your camping trip and require frequent changes of clothing.


Bring multiple plastic shopping bags or trash bags with you on the camping trip, then place your toddler's dirty, wet, and soiled clothes in the bags. This will keep dirty clothes separated from clean, dry clothes.

, Depending on where you camp, your toddler may be exposed to hours of direct sunlight or mosquitoes and other pests.

, Since toddlers will most likely become messy while playing and eating outdoors, these items can help keep your toddler fairly clean and free of bacteria throughout the day.

, Examples of snacks that can keep your toddler well-nourished in between meals are granola bars, crackers, dried fruit, and trail mix.

, For safety purposes, you should bring a first-aid kit and flashlights.


You can choose a family-sized tent to accommodate all your family members or separate tents for the parents and kids. Also bring toddler- or children-sized sleeping bags that contain comfortable mats or pads. Kid-specific sleeping bags will keep your toddler warmer at night.

Assess whether the thumb-sucking is a problem.,
Watch for triggers.,
Ignore it.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Cover the thumb.,
Distract your child with activities that require two hands.,
Remember to engage your child in the process.",How to Stop Thumbsucking1," Thumb-sucking is a normal, natural behavior for many children, and is something they do to comfort themselves and alleviate anxiety. Generally, it will not need correction if it does not continue past 2-4 years of age; most children will give it up before starting kindergarten. However, if you notice any of the following, it might be a problem.


It's causing dental problems- Thumb-sucking can sometimes affect a child's bite, the alignment of their teeth, or the way the roof of their mouth develops.
It's causing social problems - Children who suck their thumb may be teased, ostracized or bullied.
It's causing medical problems- Persistent thumbsucking can cause the skin on the thumb to shrivel, crack, or chap. It can prevent the nail from growing properly, or even cause infections under and around the nail bed.;
, Many children suck their thumb only at certain times, like when they are falling asleep or riding in the car. Others do it for comfort when they're hurt or upset. In many cases, they might not even be aware that they are sucking their thumb. Learning your child's triggers can offer clues as to the best method for helping them stop.

, Children often use behaviors like thumbsucking to get attention from adults; they can also become battlegrounds for power struggles between parents and children. The more you talk about or call attention to the behavior, the more your child will do it. If you suspect this is the case, try to ignore the thumbsucking for a period of time. Give it about a month, and see what happens. Your child may stop sucking their thumb on their own.

, Positive reinforcement is one of the best ways to encourage behavior change in children. Give verbal praise to your child for not sucking their thumb. You could also set up a simple reward system. Put a sticker on the calendar for every day your child does not suck their thumb. At the end of a week with no thumbsucking, give your child a small reward or prize - an extra bedtime story or a small toy. At the end of a month, offer a larger reward, perhaps a special outing. Gradually extend the length of time required to earn rewards.

, A thumb that is covered will not feel or taste the same as a bare thumb, and this is often enough to stop many children's thumbsucking. Try a band aid, a finger cot, a small finger puppet, or a thumb guard. If thumbsucking occurs mainly at night, try putting a mitten or a sock over the hand.

, It's hard for a child to suck their thumb if it's in use. Keep your child busy with art supplies, outdoor play, blocks, puzzles, or anything that requires them to use two hands.

, No matter what method you choose, it will not work if your child does not want to stop thumbsucking. You will meet with much greater success if you are working with a willing participant. Talk to your child about why they need to stop sucking their thumb. Explain your plan and make sure they know what to expect. Ask them what might help them stop; their answers might surprise you.

Understand why you suck your thumb.,
Identify a substitute.,
Keep your hands busy.,
Try negative reinforcement.,
Get professional help.,
Apply nail polish.",How to Stop Thumbsucking2," Adults suck their thumb for the same reason children do: it feels good and comforts them. For some, it's just a bad habit; for others, it's a mechanism for coping with stress. Try these ideas for figuring out why you suck your thumb.


Keep a journal - Every time you catch yourself sucking your thumb, write it down. Note what's happening and what you are thinking or feeling at that moment.
Look for patterns - At the end of the week, look over the notes in your journal and look for patterns in your thumbsucking. You may find that you always suck your thumb when you feel stressed or bored, when you are watching TV, or when you are falling asleep.
Pay attention - Now that you're aware of your habit and your patterns, pay attention when you're in situations that lead to thumbsucking. Sometimes simply being aware of your habit can help you end it.

, If you find that having something in your mouth is soothing, try something else besides your thumb. Try a lollipop, mints, gum, or a piece of hard candy.

, You can't suck your thumb if you are using your hands. Pick up a hobby like knitting or crocheting. Carry something in your pocket like a worry stone or stress ball, and play with it when you get the urge to suck your thumb.

, Negative reinforcement isn't the best way to end a habit, but it does work for some people. Apply a bitter or bad tasting substance to your thumb. Wear a rubber band around your wrist, and snap it every time you find yourself sucking your thumb. Or, adopt the ""swear jar"" concept and make yourself literally pay for thumbsucking.

, Some adults suck their thumb because of serious anxiety problems, and they are not able to end their habit until they address its root cause. If you suspect this is the case for you, seek the services of a counselor or other mental health professional.

, Some people find that the taste of nail polish deters them from thumbsucking.

Choose carefully.,
Measure your child’s feet.,
Shop without your child beforehand.,
Bring your child to the store.,
Create an unremarkable routine.,
Experiment and find out how your child likes to put their shoes on.,
Consider the location where you put the shoes on.,
Put on shoes when your toddler is in the stroller or car.,
Sing.,
”Trick” your child.,
Play games.,
Tell a story.,
Use your phone.",How to Put Shoes on a One Year Old," A 1 year-old’s shoes will be very different from the adult shoes you’re used to dealing with. They should be made to bend easily with breathable fabric uppers and provide a form fitting design. A child’s feet need to be as active and comfortable as possible while safe and well-protected, so make sure the shoes reflect all of these concerns.


For proper foot development, it’s best for a toddler to wear no shoes at all. This is known as the “barefoot principle.” When you leave the house, however, shoes are necessary for safety and health reasons. If you do have to put shoes on your child, make sure to keep in mind the barefoot principle of child development when choosing your child’s footwear and choose shoes that most closely resemble being barefoot.;
, Preferably, have a professional measure your child’s feet as it’s a sign of being more mature that your child will take pride in. Not only that, you’ll most likely get a far more accurate measurement than if you try by yourself.


Trying to put shoes of the wrong size on your toddler may cause your little one to scream or resist during future dressings.
Ideally, you should have your baby’s feet measured every six months.
For a one year-old, purchase shoes in the store and not on the Internet. It’s important that you feel the shoe, its flexibility, materials, and see how well it conforms to your child’s feet., Your child will invariably pick the shoes that are the worst for their little feet. If you check with the store first, you can narrow the list to the healthiest options so that when your little one comes with you, the options are already set and can be presented to your toddler so they have a very limited selection.


There are shoes that light up, that are covered with cartoon characters, that have pretty bows or cool superheroes. You want to eliminate all that are not good for your child’s feet. If you know where these shoes are located in the store, you and your little one can whisk right past these shoes and on to the choices you have already picked out.
If there are quality shoes that also happen to have some of these exciting options, you’re gold. This can turn the chore of putting on your toddler’s shoes into a favorite time of day.

, Since you’ve hopefully already zeroed in on the best shoes for your little one’s feet, you can go straight to those you have selected and let your toddler choose. This will help immensely in getting the shoes on later.


Children are really no different than adults in this regard: if children pick out shoes they like, they are more apt to be in a happier frame of mind when they have to put them on.

, Establishing routines positively affects your child in a myriad of ways. Children like the familiarity and it builds trust and a feeling of safety. It also gives little ones the opportunity to learn to start processes on their own, which builds self-confidence and self-esteem while also reducing the time needed to put shoes on your one year old if you are ever in a hurry to get out the door.If you keep shoes near the door, for instance, your child will know that upon approaching the door it is time to sit on the steps (or floor) for “shoe time.” You can even explain why we need shoes as you put the shoes on you toddler.
You can repeat a mantra, such as: first we put on the socks, then we put on the shoes, then we go play and have fun!

, Some children prefer to sit or stand while their shoes are put on while others prefer to be held. Depending on the preferences of your child, you should select a position that is both convenient for you and comfortable for your little one.


If you prefer to hold your child, sit with your child facing away from you on your lap.

, Being so near the door may be too exciting for your toddler to sit still. If that is the case, try another neutral area that doesn’t contain their toys or other highly desired items that can cause angst.

, This can eliminate the headache of a toddler on the loose. The child is already strapped in. As a routine it also helps positively build your child’s emotional well-being while bringing you closer together.It can also be easier because your toddler will learn that to get out and having shoes on is a necessary first step.

, It can be a silly song, one of their favorite songs, or even just a song that you love that you sing quietly. Singing attracts your child’s attention and gets it away from the shoes that are going on the little one’s feet., I’ve-got-your-nose is a great one to get your toddler laughing and engaged on you rather than the shoes going on your child’s feet. You can have your toddler check behind his/her ears because you see something. Your child, of course, finds nothing and will be astounded when you find a penny back there.

, Sit near a window and play “I Spy”. Talk to their toes and have the toes count off as you put the sock on. See who can make the funniest face or noise. Try to make the most animal noises you can., This can feel like a slippery slope because it can be hard to have that many stories up your sleeve. The good news is, kids love hearing stories repeated. A one year-old can even repeat words or phrases from a favorite story after a while. Don’t be afraid or intimidated by not having enough because what you have will be plenty.When telling a familiar story you can ask your child, “Do you remember what happened next?”
You can make up a fictional character and tell stories about him/her. You can make these stories up entirely or use events in your own life to make it easier to remember the details.

, This may be the last resort, the Defcon 1 of attention deception. Kids love the games on your phone so make sure you have a couple your child likes. If shoe time is that bad, make those few minutes game time on the phone.

Evaluate whether the child can live independently.,
Consider community living options.,
Look at in-home services for a more independent person.,
Create visual cues for self care.,
Identify transportation needs.,
Read about autistic adults.,
Seek out services.",How to Help an Autistic Child Transition Into Adulthood1," Every autistic child is different, and while some children may have no problem eventually living independently, for others this may be difficult or impossible.Look at the child as an individual when considering accommodations. For example, if the child has problems with executive functioning, you may need to provide extra reminders and triggers that allow the child to complete daily activities with minimal stress. These can be revised over time to create a more functional system for your child.
Autistic children may need to be taught specific, sequential steps to completing different tasks, especially if they lack adaptive skills. For example, an autistic child whose alarm clock stops working may decide the solution is to sleep in their classroom so they're not late for class, rather than replacing the battery in the alarm clock.Talk to the child and find out whether they want to live on their own. While this is a goal for some children, others may feel more comfortable and secure if they continue to live at home with their parents.
You may also want to consult their treatment team to assess the likelihood of succeeding independently and their functioning outside of the home.;
, Many communities have living options that allow higher-support autistic people live relatively independently with help from a full-time professional staff. These services can be recommended through your insurance company, organizations that serve people with autism, or members of your child's care team.Many of these facilities have counseling and job-placement services, and may also provide transportation to and from work and other social outings.
These facilities also offer many activities and other opportunities that the autistic person otherwise wouldn't be able to access, since support services for autistic adults can be very limited.
If the child needs a lot of help but wants to try living independently rather than staying at home, a community living arrangement may provide the best balance of support and independence.

, Autistic adults with lower support needs may be able to own or rent a place of their own, if they can get help with chores such as cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping. Look for assisted living options if you and your child think that this would suit them best.


If it is more financially feasible or would make your child more comfortable, you can also create a rotating list of family members and close friends who can stop by and check in on your child occasionally.

, If some autistic people can't see a visual reminder to do something, they won't do it. This can be a problem in traditional housing, where items that normally would trigger a response to do something are hidden away in drawers and cupboards.You can use images and charts as reminders to complete various tasks. Keep each step as small as possible so the task is not too vague or overwhelming.
For example, you might make a sign to hang on the back of the front door that says ""do you have..."" followed by a list of things the child normally needs when they leave the house (such as their backpack, house keys, bus pass, and phone).
You also can create signs in the bathroom and kitchen to ensure all steps of basic self-care tasks, such as eating and bathing, are completed correctly.

, Many autistic people eventually learn how to drive, but it may take an autistic person longer to learn than it would for other children. Even autistic people who know how to drive well may not be comfortable with long distances.If the child will have their own car, keep in mind that there's more to owning a car than just driving it. Make sure the child understands vehicle maintenance and knows what to do in case of an emergency.
Go over the car insurance with the child so they know who to call and what steps to take in case of an accident or mechanical failure. You might also include detailed instructions in the glove box for common issues, such as changing a tire.
If you live in an area with significant public transportation, that may be an option. The place where the child lives will have to be convenient to a public transportation stop.
Transportation to and from medical appointments may also be available through your insurance. Check with your healthcare provider to see if this would be covered.

, You can learn a lot about transitioning into adulthood by reading blogs and books written by autistic adults who have had successful careers and other experiences.Since services for autistic adults are limited, and have historically been even more limited if not nonexistent, many autistic adults discovered adaptive techniques and helpful accommodations on their own through trial and error.
You can help an autistic child transition into adulthood by taking advantage of this wealth of experience and learning tricks from those who have already been through the transition stage.
Accounts from autistic adults to seek out include the writings of Temple Grandin, who has written a number of books on her experience with autism, and Cynthia Kim, who has several published books about being an autistic adult, and also blogs about her experience at musingsofanaspie.com., In many communities, services for autistic adults are limited. For this reason, it's important to identify services that may benefit the child with their transition into adulthood as soon as possible.Many services have waiting lists, which means you need to sign the child up early so the services are available when they need them. Ask the organization that supplies the services if the child has to be over 18 before they can be put on the wait list, or if they have a separate wait list for minors.
Services you might want to look for include support groups with fellow autistic students, life skills mentorship programs, and college or career orientation and mentorship programs.
Keep in mind that the transition into adulthood is an ongoing process, not a single event such as turning 18 or graduating from high school. Even if services aren't available immediately or as early as needed, they can still be beneficial later on.

Create an individual transition plan.,
Identify the child's strengths.,
Get the child involved in extra-curricular activities.,
Translate special interests into a career plan.,
Discuss higher education.,
Encourage self-advocacy.",How to Help an Autistic Child Transition Into Adulthood2," In the United States, federal law requires individual transition plans to be created for students with special needs, including autistic teens, when they reach 14 or 16 years of age.Even if you don't live in the U.S. or the child isn't going to public school, an individual transition plan still can be beneficial for the child. In other countries, talk to teachers or professionals to find out if there are similar legal requirements.
Creating an individual transition plan involves bringing together a team of people who are responsible for the child's well-being. This could include not only the parents and the student, but also teachers, counselors, health care providers, coaches, and even employers (if the child has a part-time job).
You may want to start this plan (or at least start thinking about it) before the child starts high school, so their high school studies and activities can be coordinated from day one depending on their strengths and interests.

, The child's strengths and special interests can pave the way to a fulfilling career and successful transition into adulthood. The child's educational and vocational plan should focus more on strengths than on overcoming deficits.For example, an autistic child who is good at math and memorizing computer codes might want to become a computer programmer. Many certification tests can be taken without completing a traditional university course of study.
If the child is a visual thinker who excels at photography or other artistic pursuits, a plan can be developed that takes those strengths into account, such as becoming a photojournalist or special events photographer.
Once you identify the child's strengths, you can work from their to determine what accommodations the child will need to pursue those strengths.

, Extra-curricular activities in high school not only help a child become more knowledgeable in an area, they also build social skills. Activities based around the child's special interests make it easier to meet others who share that interest.If the child is interested, consider school sports for physical activity. Autistic children may be more interested in individual sports, such as running, than in team sports.
Volunteer work also can allow the child to interact with people who share their interests while working for a good cause. For example, if the child has a special interest in animals, they might volunteer to work with the dogs at the local animal shelter.
If the child is interested in computer programming, math, or science, consider getting the child involved in math or science clubs at school.

, A good career often intersects with special interests that have grown and persisted since childhood. Cataloging these special interests, along with what type of work environment would be beneficial for your child, can help narrow down options. A career counselor can help you with this process.Typically, the autistic person will need to start at the entry level and work their way up. Most autistic adults don't have the social skills to sell themselves in an interview, so they need to gain experience that will help them move up the career ladder over time.
For example, a child who is a visual thinker may enjoy a career in drafting. As they gain experience, they may be able to move into architectural design.
A child with a special interest in animals can easily start as a dog trainer, groomer, or veterinary assistant.
If your child is enrolled in community college or a university, career counseling may be available to them for free. If not, your insurance may be able to help you find an occupational counselor.

, Getting a college degree may be good for teens who want a more specialized field. In some trades, while a college degree isn't necessary, it can provide a more stable footing in the field.The child might want to enroll initially in a community college, where they can take basic courses before moving to a larger university.
Some autistic students may only be able to handle part-time schooling, while others benefit from the routine of a full-time university schedule.
If the student plans on living at home, look for schools nearby that offer the types of degree programs the student might want. If they want to live in a dorm, look for schools that have robust support programs and services where the student can get reliable assistance.

, Once an autistic child is out on their own, they must be able to tell others when they need certain accommodations or when something is bothering them. You can help the child transition to adulthood by teaching them how to effectively advocate for their own needs, and giving them guidance to find their own solutions, rather than telling them what to do.Talk to the child about how to ask for help if they need it, and how to communicate their needs to others. Keep in mind that the child may not be able to recognize when they need help.
You may be able to work with counselors and health care providers to create social stories to help younger children understand how to recognize when they need assistance and when they can do things on their own.
Taking into account when surroundings may be overwhelming, teach the child to speak up for themselves rather than relying on you or another adult to do it for them. For example, at a restaurant you might say ""tell the server what you want to eat and how it should be cooked.""
The Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) hosts an annual summer leadership conference (the ""Autism Campus Inclusion Summer Leadership Academy"") that helps train students on effective campus-based advocacy and self-advocacy skills and techniques."

Help with networking.,
Assess social and communication needs.,
Look for internships.,
Work around interviews.,
Understand the limitations of school-based programs.",How to Help an Autistic Child Transition Into Adulthood3," Networking is the best way for anyone to find a job, and this is even more true for autistic students and adults, who may have difficulty presenting themselves in a traditional interview situation. Work with your child on understanding the difference between talking with friends and interacting in a professional setting.Talk to people who work at jobs the child finds interesting, or that line up with their special interests. Find out if the child can shadow that person on a day at work, or if they would be willing to mentor the child.
Set up one-on-one encounters in which the child has the opportunity to show the person what they can do, rather than being asked simply to talk about themselves.
Build a relationship with one person so they can introduce the child to others who can provide additional assistance related to the child's interests or chosen career path.

, Different types of jobs may be appropriate depending on the child's communication abilities and how well they interact socially, particularly with people they don't know well.If the child has significant communication difficulties, they may not be comfortable in a job that requires interacting with the public on a regular basis, such as jobs in the sales or services industry.
On the other hand, autistic people who are adept at handling scripts typically can handle basic cashiering duties, because the clerks in those positions usually say the same things to each customer who comes through the line.
It's also worth keeping in mind that many autistic people don't mind repetitive or monotonous tasks such as stocking or cleaning. Autistic children who cannot work specialized jobs might find these types of jobs pleasing.
Some jobs, such as graphic design or computer programming, may have a social element that can be worked around when there are individuals who are profoundly adept at what they do. For example, the autistic person may be able to team up with a co-worker who handles the presentation or sales aspects of the job.

, Internships are a great way for autistic people to get their foot in the door with an employer and show others their skills and how helpful they could be. An internship also gives an autistic person a chance to ""try out"" a workplace and see how well it meets their needs.In many cases, an autistic person who feels comfortable at a company will stay there for long periods of time. An internship may lead to a job offer, which leads to long-term employment.
Focus on internships that are guided and have a lot of supervision over those in which the intern is expected to be more self-directed or self-motivated.
Make sure the autistic student will have ample opportunity at any internship to demonstrate their skills and practice in the field.

, Autistic students may not perform well in interviews due to a lack of social skills and an inability to ""sell themselves."" For these reasons, it's often important to find other ways for an autistic person to be recognized by an employer.Internships are one way for autistic people to get their foot in the door, but internships may not be plentiful in some industries.
You can help an autistic child transition into adulthood by helping them build a portfolio of their work product and building a list of their accomplishments in their chosen field.
Once the child has a significant portfolio of work, they can contact employers and sell their body of work rather than trying to sell themselves or impress and interviewer with their social skills.

, Many school-based programs may lack resources, or may group autistic students with high IQs or exceptional skills together with other special-needs students who lack their abilities, which can hold the gifted back.Part of helping an autistic child transition into adulthood is assessing the programs available and finding additional services and support when school-based programs are lacking.
Work with the child's teachers to understand exactly what the school can offer. Compare this to the child's needs to determine where you might need to pick up the slack to ensure the child is best served, taking advantage of all the resources at your disposal.

Stroke the back of your child’s hands.,
Let your baby play on their tummy.,
Stretch their arms.,
Get a baby gym.",How to Build Your Baby's Motor Skills1," You could stroke your child’s hands with your own hand, or with an object you want them to become familiar with and grasp. For instance, if you want to encourage motor skills that could help your child grip a rattle, you might stroke the back of their hands gently with a rattle. When they open their fingers, place it in their palm.Your baby might be able to grasp the rattle already, but they probably won’t be able to hold it for long.;
, With your baby on their tummy, they will have to work their neck muscles more actively to look up and side-to-side.Other muscle groups that will be more active than they would be if your baby was simply placed on their back include the shoulders, arms, and hand muscles. Your baby will also be better prepared to start crawling.Always supervise your baby when they are on their tummy. Do not leave them for any reason. You should never put the baby on their tummy while they sleep, even for a nap.

, Young babies cannot move their limbs well, but you can help them stretch their arms. Lay the baby on their back. Gently grasp their hands, and stretch their arms above their head before bringing them back down. You can repeat this motion a few times.

Try singing or talking to your baby as you do this.
Be gentle. Do not pull on their arms or stretch them too quickly., A baby gym is a contraption with many baby-friendly shapes – animals, stars, and everyday objects – arranged in a low arc or set of interlocking arcs. Sliding the baby beneath this arc on their back lets them see and interact with a variety of objects. In this way, baby gyms can improve hand-eye coordination."
"
Teach your baby “Patty Cake.” Patty Cake is a popular children’s tune with a sequence of accompanying hand motions.,
Show your child “The Itsy-Bitsy Spider.” This song describes the trials and travails of a spider who meets with some initial misfortune but ultimately prevails.,
Change your baby’s position regularly.,
Give your baby lots of objects.,
Play with your baby.",How to Build Your Baby's Motor Skills2," To perform the hand motion, sit your baby in your lap so that you are both facing the same direction. Clap your baby’s hands together, then take the baby’s left hand and stretch it forward with the palm facing ahead. Then bring the baby’s hands back together to clap again. Move your baby’s right hand forward with the palm facing out just as you did with the baby’s left hand. Repeat until the song is complete.Check the song out online with a video of the accompanying hand motions so you can better understand how they fit together.
Later, when your child is better able to perform the hand motions, you can sit across from them and play Patty Cake together.Your child will be much impressed by both of you performing the same actions in tandem.

, Turn your left palm inward so it faces you. Place your right index finger against your left thumb and your left index finger against your right thumb. Then, at the same time, rotate both hands so that your right thumb and left index finger are oriented above your other fingers. Repeat for the first stanza of the song.The next part of the song describes rainfall. Put your hands up in the air and splay your fingers. Bring them down slowly while wiggling them.
The next part of the song describes a sunrise. Place one hand over the other and bring your elbows inward slightly so that your arms approximate an inverted “U”. Slowly lift your arms to indicate the rising sun.
Repeat the first hand sequence of the song to complete it.
Check the song out online with a video of the accompanying hand motions so you can better understand how they fit together.

, Instead of only setting your baby on their back or stomach, try setting them on their side. When babies are in new positions, they are forced to exercise different muscle groups and move in new ways.After your baby is about 4 months old, you can pull your baby up into a standing position by gripping them beneath their armpits. As they put one foot on front of the other, move your baby forward slowly. This will help your baby develop the motor skills eventually used to walk and run.Move your child to new environments, too. For instance, place your baby in their crib, then move them to the floor., Provide your baby with age-appropriate playthings of different types to help them understand how to grab, move, drop, and toss objects with different weights, sizes, and textures.For instance, your baby will have great fun with plush toys, soft blocks, balls, and household items like plastic cups and plates.
Make sure your baby has age-appropriate items and objects. Do not give your baby anything with small parts, or with parts that could break off, as the parts might get lodged in the baby’s throat. Similarly, avoid giving your baby anything that has a rope or string that could present a choking hazard.

, In addition to independent play, your baby will benefit from playing games with you using the objects you’ve provided for them. For instance, if your baby has a ball, roll it across the floor toward them. This will give your baby the opportunity to develop hand-eye coordination as they move to intercept it.You might also help your baby develop grasping skills by tugging gently on a particular object they are holding. This should, with repetition, inspire your baby to grasp more tightly to objects you tug on.
You could build a block tower with your baby. Your baby might also enjoy knocking such a tower down, which involves a different set of movements."
"
Let your baby feed themselves.,
Create mazes.,
Encourage your baby to copy you.,
Reward your baby’s pointing.,
Provide opportunities for your baby to fill and dump.,
Ask your baby to perform simple actions.,
Help your child draw.,
Give your baby clay.",How to Build Your Baby's Motor Skills3," Give your baby a plate or bowl of food and encourage them to use their hands or a spoon, depending on the food. This will prepare your baby to feed itself with more precision in the future.For instance, you could feed your baby some baby food in a small bowl and provide a spoon. Or you could provide finger foods like small bits of diced apple that your baby can pick up and put in their mouth.
Your baby will probably make a mess. Tie a bib around the baby’s neck and lay a placemat on your baby’s tray. You can also place a blanket or towel on the ground around their high chair.

, After about seven months, your baby will start crawling. Stack pillows in low piles on the ground in front of your baby so they have a sort of maze to navigate. This will help them develop motor skills used to change direction and turn their head and neck., At around nine months, your baby may start copying things that you do. Perform an action, then narrate what you’re doing. For instance, you might wave your hands in front of you and say, “I am waving my arms like spaghetti.” Continue to engage in your motion of choice. Your baby will look at you first with curiosity, then with enjoyment. You could ask, “Can you wave your arms like wacky spaghetti, too?” Once your baby identifies your action with fun, they will copy it.Continue to introduce your baby to new motions that, if copied, could help your baby develop new motor skills.
You can play this game any time, anywhere.
Your baby will not copy you every time you perform a particular action.

, When your baby is about one year old, they will become more adept at working their fingers independently of each other. This means that they will learn to point at people and things they recognize. Acknowledge your baby when they do so. For instance, if your baby points at their ball, say, “Oh, you want your ball,” and roll the ball toward your baby. If your baby points at their sibling, say, “Yes, that is your brother.”, At some point, your baby will discover how to fill and empty a container (like a bucket, bowl, or other container) with an object (like dirt, sand, or toys). Once this occurs, your baby will probably go through a distinct fill/dump phase.You can help your baby develop and perfect these motor skills by providing lightweight buckets or bowls of varying shapes and sizes.
Provide a variety of potential fillings for the containers like toys cars, blocks, and stuffed animals.
If you take your baby to the beach or playground, encourage them to fill the bucket with sand, then dump it out.

, Once your baby is about one year old, they will be able to understand simple commands and perform simple tasks. Make requests of your baby that encourage them to build their motor skills. For instance, you could ask your baby to squeeze a toy that makes a sound, or press a button a light-up gadget., Once your child is 12 to 18 months old, they will be able to draw and scribble. They will not be able to write letters for some time, but you can help them get used to holding a crayon or marker by providing some along with a sheet of paper while they are strapped into a high-chair. Alternatively, you could allow your baby to scribble or draw on a large piece of cardboard or poster board on the floor.Sit across from your child while they draw and draw a picture of your own to demonstrate how to create images.
Monitor your baby while they use crayons and markers to ensure they don’t color on surfaces they shouldn’t. Do not let them put the crayons in their mouth.

, Nontoxic modeling clay provides opportunities for your baby to roll, smash, and mold using their hands. For instance, you could provide your child with some clay of different colors. Set your child in a seated position with a tray or other flat surface in front of them.Always supervise the baby while you let them play with clay so that they do not put it in their mouth.


Provide a set of plastic cookie cutters, too, so your baby can develop motor skills involved in pressing different shapes into the clay.
Don’t allow your baby to play with clay on a carpeted surface or it might end up getting bits of clay stuck on the carpet.

Find someone who wants to do the job.,
Pick someone who likes kids.,
Think about physical capability.,
Figure out what instructions you need to give.,
Remember the choice is yours.",How to Ask a Relative to Watch Your Kids1," The best relative to watch your kids is someone who genuinely enjoys the job. It's best for everyone involved, including your child, to select a family member who will eagerly accept the task.Avoid asking family members who are people pleasers by nature. If your sister, for example, is the helpful type, she may agree to watch your kids when she does not really want to. This can lead to feelings of resentment, which can be stressful for your children.
Instead, think about who in your family would actually want the job. Who gets along best with your kids? Who seems to have the most fun interacting with your children? This is the person to ask.;
, Not everyone takes to children and some people may even be nervous or uncomfortable around them. You want to ask someone who genuinely enjoys being around kids, as this will create the best atmosphere for your children while you are away.Some people may enjoy being around your kids for a bit, but do not like to linger. Maybe your brother, for example, enjoys holding the baby on occasion, but tends to get a little nervous once your child starts fussing.
Instead, choose someone who's good with children. You may want to pick someone who has kids of their own, or someone who works with children professionally. If your cousin, say, teaches kindergarten, they may be a great choice to watch your kids.

, Watching children can require some physical exertion, especially very young children that need to be carried on occasion. You want to make sure you ask a relative who's physically up to the task.Think about how high energy your children are. Older children may be more calm than, say, a toddler. You want someone who's capable of keeping up with your kids if they tend to run around and get into things.
Pick someone in decent physical shape. If possible, see if you can find someone who has young children of their own. This person may be best equipped to watch your kids.

, Childcare can be a tricky process. Your relative may have different ideas about child rearing than you do. You want to make sure you know what instructions to give. With this is mind, you want to pick someone who's willing to follow your rules without protest. Someone who is, say, very opinionated about raising children may not be the best choice if their opinions differ from yours.Think about all the basic rules in your home. How do you discipline your kids? When are meal times and what do you serve? What kind of schedule do you follow regarding things like chores, homework, naps, bedtime, and so on?
Jot down a list of any instructions you need to give. Think about someone who will follow these instructions. If your brother loves hanging out with your kids, but is more of a friend than an authority figure, he may not be the best choice. Instead, opt for someone who knows how to keep kids in line while still being caring and nurturing.

, With family situations, things can get tricky. If your mother is, say, very close to your son, and wants to be very involved with your life, you may feel inclined to ask her to watch him. However, choose the family member you feel is best equipped for the job. Remember, you have the right to make the decision that feels right for you and your child.

Ask early when possible.,
Do not enter the situation feeling guilty.,
Be upfront about the fact you're asking for a favor.,
Provide an escape route.,
Offer to reciprocate in the future.,
Thank the person sincerely.",How to Ask a Relative to Watch Your Kids2," It's not always possible to make plans ahead of time, especially if something comes up last minute. However, when possible, ask early. You're more likely to get a ""Yes"" if the person you're asking has a heads up.

, Oftentimes, people feel guilty when asking for a favor. If you go into the situation experiencing guilt, you may not ask directly enough. If you don't make your needs clear, you're less likely to have them met by your relative. Try to abandon feelings of guilt before making the request.Remember, raising children is a difficult and at times demanding task. Almost everyone has to ask for help on occasion when raising children. There is no shame in needing extra help.

, People are more likely to say ""Yes"" if they have some warning first you're asking for a favor. If people feel you're being indirect, they may feel resentful or annoyed. Even if you feel awkward asking for help, be direct when requesting a favor of someone. Your relative will probably appreciate you being straightforward.Start with a brief heads up. Say something like, ""Mom, could I ask you for a favor?"" Start with this instead of, ""Mom, can you watch the kids for me Saturday night?""
If you make it clear you're asking for a favor first, your relative will not be caught off guard. Once you've stated you're asking for a favor, make it clear what you want. For example, ""Could you babysit for me Saturday night if you're not too busy?""
It can also help to explain why you need help. In general, people like to know why they're being asked to do something. For example, ""Because I have my office Christmas party that night and I don't want to miss it. Our regular sitter cancelled.""

, You do not want to make your relative feel locked in. This can lead to feelings of resentment. No one wants to feel like they're required to do a favor simply because they're asked. Remind your family member watching your kids, while appreciated, is absolutely optional. You understand they are busy too and they are by no means obligated to help you out.After making your request, say something like, ""Of course, I totally get it if you're busy. I just thought I'd ask in case you're able.""

, People want to feel their relationships with others are balanced. If you're requesting a favor of a relative, make sure you let them know you're willing to provide a favor in return. For example, ""If you ever need anything from me, let me know. I owe you one."", After the person has agreed to watch your kids, give them a sincere ""Thanks."" Watching children is not an easy task, and you want to show the person you appreciate their time. Let them know how much the favor meant to you.Be specific about how much they helped you. For example, ""Thanks so much for watching James this afternoon. I wouldn't have made it to my dentist appointment if you hadn't helped me out.""

Keep communication open and honest.,
Let the family know what activities your child enjoys.,
Figure out a means of contact.,
Have a plan for emergencies.",How to Ask a Relative to Watch Your Kids3," With a babysitter or nanny, you have a lot of power in the situation. Someone's job depends on following your rules. With a relative, however, the situation is more sensitive. A relative may be more likely to push boundaries, as they feel secure in their relationship with you. Therefore, it's important to keep communication open and honest. You want to make sure your relative follows your rules regarding childcare.Check in regularly while your relative is watching your child. Make sure your relative knows your rules and which rules you need to be followed 100% of the time.
Be transparent about your rules. For example, if you have a specific reason for not letting your child have sugar, let your relative know this. While they may disagree, make it clear they need to follow this rule with your child.

, At places like daycare, children are often exposed to age appropriate activities that can help with development. A family member may not have special training that helps them guide a child's development. Make sure to let your family member know what activities are best for your child. It can help to leave them with a list of activities your child enjoys and are stimulating for their development., It's important to have contact with a family member while you're away from your child. Your relative probably has access to your regular cellphone number. However, you may want to leave information on how to reach you at places like work as well. In case anything happens, you want your relative to be able to contact you., You should also leave the contact information of your child's doctor in the event of an accident, injury, or illness while you're away. Your should also leave the addresses of local emergency rooms and urgent care clinics in the event of an emergency.

Learn what Down syndrome is.,
Recognize the abilities and talents of children with Down syndrome.,
Be aware of misconceptions about Down Syndrome.,
Get medical support for your child.,
Get educational support for your child.,
Teach your child how to make friends.,
Take a break.,
Model accepting and kind behavior.,
Create a support network.,
Get involved.",How to Help a Child with Down Syndrome," Down syndrome is a genetic disorder. It happens when someone is born with an extra copy of Chromosome 21. This extra genetic material affects a person’s development.Down syndrome causes changes in physical development. People with Down syndrome may be more prone to medical conditions like heart or respiratory issues. Lower muscle tone, smaller stature, and flat facial features also affect some people with Down syndrome.People with Down syndrome typically have some sort of intellectual disability. This means they develop at a slower pace or take longer to learn new information. For example, a child with Down syndrome may learn to walk later than most children. An adult with Down syndrome may need extra help learning a new task.
Every person with Down syndrome is an individual. Physical and intellectual development varies greatly from person-to-person. Most issues affecting development are mild to moderate. With modern medical care, people with Down syndrome have an average life expectancy of 60 years.;
, Children with Down syndrome lead rich and fulfilling lives. Their personalities and talents are just as varied as any other child’s. They have a full range of emotions, from pride and happiness to fear and disappointment.Many children with Down syndrome are in regular education classrooms. They may get extra support for certain subjects like reading or math. With the right support, most children learn to read and write. Eventually they can get vocational training, hold jobs, and some even go to college.
Just like other children, children with Down syndrome have different talents and strengths. Some love music and art while others like to play sports. Some are shy and timid while others are outgoing and bold.

, In the not too distant past, children with Down syndrome were treated poorly by society. They were sent away to institutions and denied appropriate medical care and learning support. Unfortunately, negative perceptions still exist. Society is not always accepting of people with Down syndrome. Adults and children may tease, taunt, and avoid children with Down syndrome. Those with Down syndrome experience pain and hurt just like any other person. Social rejection damages their self-esteem.
As they get older, they may be passed over for a job because of their condition. It’s a misconception that people with Down syndrome can’t work or take care of themselves. Most people with this condition grow into productive adults who can contribute to society.Children with Down syndrome face hurdles like discrimination and lack of acceptance. They need extra support from their loved ones and caregivers so they can overcome these obstacles.

, Make sure your loved one has all the support they need to succeed at home and at school. Since every child with Down syndrome is unique, they each need a personalized plan to help them reach their full potential.


Find a pediatrician or primary care provider that you trust. The pediatrician should have strong communication skills and experience with Down syndrome, or be willing to learn about the condition. A pediatrician helps you coordinate your child’s medical care.Connect with your local early intervention services. They can help babies and toddlers with developmental delays and learning disabilities. Services like occupational, physical and speech therapy are often low cost or free. Contact the Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center in your state: http://ectacenter.org/contact/ptccoord.asp. Tell them you want early intervention services and need to schedule an evaluation., Partner with your child’s school. You need to work as a team with teachers and school counselors to make sure your child is getting all the academic and social support they need.Many children benefit from inclusion, which is attending regular education classes, with extra support. Others benefit from attending special education classes, or a combination of regular and special education.By law, children with Down syndrome who attend public school are entitled to an Individualized Education Plan or IEP. This is a plan you create with the school that addresses your child’s specific learning needs. It is reviewed each year.Contact the school counselor and say you want to set up an IEP. The school will schedule an evaluation and then you’ll attend meetings to create and approve the IEP., Children with Down syndrome benefit from practicing social skills. Making friends can be a challenge for any child. Children with this condition sometimes have a harder time dealing with peers.Talk about friendly and unfriendly actions and who makes a good friend. Kids who are smiling and use kind words are good new friends. Kids who ignore you, walk away, or say mean things are people to avoid.
Practice how to start a conversation. Once your child learns about who to approach and who to stay away from, practice what to say to a new friend. Work on how to introduce yourself. For example, “Hi! My name is Anna. What’s your name? What’s your favorite game to play?” Take turns rehearsing different conversation starters with your child.
Teach your child how to deal with mean or hurtful behavior. Talk to your child about what they can do if someone is unkind or mean. For example, tell the person to stop, get help from a teacher, or walk away.
Schedule play dates. Get to know other parents and help your child interact with their new friends.

, You may be a parent, sibling, grandparent or a caregiver of a child with Down syndrome. Helping a child with special needs can be hard at times. When you feel like you're burnt out or your patience is running low, get help. Take a break and share responsibilities with others. You have to take care of yourself first before you can take care of someone else.Make time for yourself. Even if you only have five minutes, spend it doing something relaxing. Take a walk, read, or stretch. Brief breaks can help you recharge.
Create a caregiver or helper schedule. For example, an older sibling helps with homework, a friend practices baseball, and you help with bedtime.
Consider respite services. Each state has respite services for caregivers of children with special needs. Respite care gives you a break while a professional care provider watches your child. The ARCH National Respite Network has a state-by-state locator tool: http://archrespite.org/us-map.

, As a friend or loved one of a child with Down syndrome, you can show others that having Down syndrome doesn’t get in the way of living a full life. By having fun, playing, and hanging out with a child with Down syndrome, you’re showing the world how they should treat children with special needs — with caring, kindness, and respect, like any other child.


Talk to your child’s school about how they promote acceptance. Ask what they do to educate children about diversity and accepting differences. How do they promote and model respect? If your school doesn’t have diversity and acceptance programs, recommend they create some.

, Connect with people in the Down syndrome community to help yourself, your child, and other families. There are online and in-person groups for parents and caregivers, siblings, and people with Down syndrome.Many local groups have community outreach activities to raise awareness and funding for Down syndrome. Contact the National Down Syndrome Society Helpline to find groups and resources in your area: http://www.ndss.org/Resources/Helpline/.

, Join local organizations that advocate for children with Down syndrome. By becoming a member, donor, or volunteer, you are taking steps to educate the public about this condition. Education dispels myths about Down syndrome and helps build a more accepting society.


The Special Olympics helps people with intellectual disabilities build their confidence and abilities through sports.
The Government Affairs Committee works to improve public policy and laws for those with Down syndrome and intellectual special needs. Join or start a National Down Syndrome Society Government Affairs Committee. You can find more information here.

Make sure that your references think positively of your ability to handle conflict, raise children, and follow through on commitments.A sample form may be found here. You should review it to see what kinds of questions the agency will ask.

, The agency will work with you to draft a foster parent training plan. The plan shall provide for individualized training needs and shall consist of no less than 12 hours of training. The training must be completed no later than the end of the original six-month licensing period and before a child is placed with the family.During the next two years, foster parents will need to take additional training—no less than 12 hours. After the first two years, foster parents will need to take no less than six hours of training in subsequent years.Some of the hours spent in orientation can count toward training, but no more than six hours maximum., Michigan has strict rules regarding bedrooms, which must provide adequate space for rest and for privacy. There must be at least 40 square feet of floor space per person, and the bedroom cannot double as another room (such as a dining room or den).The door should be “latchable,” and not lockable.

Instead, a license makes a placement possible.However, the demand for foster parents in Michigan is great.

, Effective foster parenting requires open communication between foster parents and caseworkers. When you get your first placement, ask the caseworker any questions that help you understand the child’s background. You might want to know:Why the child is in foster care.
Whether the child has been in foster care before.
If the child has any allergies or other medical concerns.
How long the child is expected to be in foster care.

, The first moments when you meet the foster child can be nerve-wracking. It is best to go outside and greet the caseworker and child together. Speak softly and smile.Do not insist that the foster child call you “Mom” or “Dad.” Let the child use whatever name is comfortable.

, To help the child adjust, you should show him or her your home. Start by showing where the child will sleep. Then show where his or her clothes will be stored.Finally, you should sit the child down and discuss the rules of the house, including your expectations. Encourage the child to ask questions and answer honestly. Be open to his talking about his natural family, and let him know that you are aware of how important his family is to him."

Change your baby's diaper right away.,
Rinse your baby's bottom every time.,
Give your baby time to dry out.,
Avoid scrubbing your baby's bottom.,
Use diaper cream.,
Switch to a less absorbent diaper.,
Make sure the diaper is the correct size.,
Avoid diapers with plastic covers and edges.,
Wash cloth diapers thoroughly.,
Avoid skin irritants.,
Watch out for food sensitivities.,
Breastfeed if possible.,
Try probiotics.",How to Avoid Diaper Rash," Wet diapers leave your baby's fragile skin much more susceptible to developing a rash. To prevent it, change your baby's diaper as soon as you notice that it is wet or soiled, even if your baby doesn't seem uncomfortable., Whenever you change your baby's diaper, you should use warm water to gently rinse his bottom. This helps ensure that your baby's skin is truly clean.Use a soft cloth or cotton balls when rinsing, but be very gentle.

, It's important not to put on a clean diaper until your baby's bottom is completely dry. Otherwise you may trap moisture in the diaper, which can lead to rashes.Try leaving your baby diaper-free for a few minutes to dry. Put a towel under your baby to prevent messes.
If you're in a hurry, pat your baby's bottom dry with a towel or use your hand to fan it dry.

, Whether you're washing, drying, or wiping, be very careful about applying too much pressure to your baby's bottom. This may cause irritation to your baby's sensitive skin, which will leave her more susceptible to developing a diaper rash.Try gently patting instead of rubbing. It's just as effective, but less likely to cause skin irritation.

, Protect your baby's bottom by applying diaper cream every time you change his diaper. This will create a barrier for his sensitive skin, so it will be less vulnerable to rashes.Some diaper creams contain petroleum jelly, and others contain zinc-oxide. Both are effective, so you may want to try both and see which kind works best for your baby.
You can also use powders, but choose ones that contain cornstarch instead of talc, as talc can cause lung damage. Always shake the powder into your hand away from your baby's face in order to apply it. This will prevent your baby from inhaling the powder., Diapers that are too absorbent may not be a good choice for babies who are prone to diaper rashes. These diapers trap too much moisture, which creates the perfect conditions for a rash to develop. Try switching to a less absorbent kind of diaper if your little one gets lots of diaper rashes.Cloth diapers are a good choice, but there are also some disposable diapers available that are less absorbent.

, If your baby's diaper is too tight, it may not allow for any air circulation. This can increase your baby's risk of developing a diaper rash, so make sure it's not time to move up to the next size.Clothing should be loose-fitting as well.
Even if your baby's diapers are the right size, be careful of over-tightening them. Try loosening up the diaper as much as you reasonably can without risking leaks., Plastic is great for trapping moisture and heat, and this is exactly what you want to avoid in your baby's diaper. To avoid giving bacteria the perfect environment to thrive in, ditch any diapers or covers that contain plastic., If you use cloth diapers, it's important to wash them so they are clean, disinfected, and free from soap residue. There are many effective washing techniques, so use whichever one works best for you.Wash in hot water with mild detergent for the best results.
Pre-soaking and double-rinsing diapers helps ensure that they are completely clean.
Consider adding bleach or vinegar to the laundry cycle.
Avoid fabric softener and dryer sheets, which can contain irritating chemicals.

, Some babies have sensitive skin that can be bothered by chemicals and fragrances. To avoid irritation from these kinds of products, clean your baby's bottom with water only whenever possible.If water won't cut it, try using fragrance-free soap or alcohol-free wipes. Never use wipes that contain alcohol, which can be very drying.
Put a drop or two of lavender into your child's bath soap before putting it into the tub. The lavender helps to prevent diaper rash. You can also use wipes with lavender in them for diaper changing.
Babies can also be allergic to disposable diapers or even the soap that you use to wash cloth diapers, so you may need to change brands.

, Some rashes can be caused by reactions to new foods that your child has started eating. It's a good idea to introduce solid foods one at a time. This will allow you to keep an eye out for any skin reactions and discontinue feeding the new food if one occurs.You don't need to avoid that food forever. Your child may become less sensitive to it as she gets older.

, Breastfeeding helps increase your child's immunity against infections, which means he will be less likely to need antibiotics. This is helpful in the fight against diaper rash, as antibiotics can trigger rashes for some babies., Probiotics encourage the growth of helpful bacteria in the digestive tract. If your baby suffers from frequent diaper rashes, probiotics may help prevent them from reoccurring.Probiotics are especially helpful if your baby needs to take antibiotics. Broad spectrum antibiotics can predispose your child to diaper rash. Antibiotics tend to kill off good bacteria in addition to the bad bacteria that is making your baby sick, so replenishing the good bacteria can help.

Start looking for child care options early.,
Talk to your company’s human resources department.,
Look for local nonprofit child care options.,
Try to find a family-run daycare.,
Explore the possibility of getting a nanny.,
Ask family members to watch your child.",How to Afford Daycare1," If you’re looking for fall daycare options, start looking in the summer before spots fill up at more affordable care centers. If you have just learned that you’re expecting, begin budgeting, educating yourself about personal finances, and reducing your other household expenses immediately. You’ll find that the more time you give yourself to plan and save, more affordable care options will be available.Look online for nearby daycare centers. Start asking for recommendations from any friends or acquaintances you have who are also parents. Look for additional child care options, such as babysitters or nannies.
For each option and recommendation you find, call ahead to ask about cost and when the program anticipates filling up spots. That way, you'll have a better idea of your timeline and of how much you'll have to pay for care.;
, Discuss more flexible hours or telecommuting a few days a week to reduce the cost of daycare. Ask if a salary raise is negotiable so you can better afford care. Whether you’ve just found out you’re expecting or have to shift your schedule around your toddler, you should ask your HR department for help.Say something like, ""I'm expecting a child, and more flexible hours would really enhance my productivity and help me balance my responsibilities. Is telecommuting two or three days a week to reduce the cost of daycare possible?""
Mention something like, ""It's been over six months since my last pay raise, and a salary increase would help me better afford daycare for my child. I believe I've demonstrated my worth to the company, and would truly love to continue to balance my home life with my work responsibilities.""
Try to include mutually beneficial solutions like, ""If I'm working from home more, it'll help save the company's resources, like wi-fi, office space, and supplies.""
Ask HR if the company has in-house child care options or a reduced-cost deal with a nearby child care center. If they don’t have either, suggest that they set up an arrangement with a nearby center, since it will save their employees money without costing the company anything.

, Look for a local YMCA, JCC, or other nonprofit organization that offers child care services. These organizations don’t have to answer to shareholders or generate profit, so they cost much less than private businesses.If you attend religious services, ask your religious organization's staff for suggestions.
Search online for a YMCA, and use keywords like ""YMCA childcare."" Look for a contact number, and ask if they can provide you with reviews from families currently enrolled who can describe their experience. Ask around your network of fellow parents to see if they have any experience with local nonprofit childcare centers.
When you call, ask if the center is licensed by state or local government, or what regulations they must meet in order to maintain their practice. Avoid centers that can't describe their standards or won't provide testimonials from parents currently using their services.

, You can also search for a local family-run daycare to cut costs. Just make sure whatever program you research is state licensed or otherwise regulated by your local government.Ask if they're accredited with the National Association for Family Child Care (NAFCC). Verify their accreditation using the NAFCC website: http://www.nafcc.org/.
Ask any potential family-run daycare options for testimonials from current clients and professional references.
Ask about the caregiver's qualifications. Ideally, go with someone with at least two years of college, at least five years experience in early childhood development, and CPR and emergency training. These factors aren't required by every state, but should nonetheless be included in your personal criteria., While daycare is typically the most affordable child care option, you might find a nanny more affordable in some circumstances. For example, your work hours might be incompatible with a daycare’s set hours, and you might have friends or coworkers who also have children around the same age as yours.You can approach your friends or coworkers and ask them if they’d be interested in sharing the cost of a nanny.
If it’s affordable, cost-sharing a nanny offers a low caregiver-to-child ratio that studies show will benefit your child later in life., Ask a family member or trusted friend to watch your child once or twice a week. Ask them if they're willing to babysit for free, or for less than you'd pay at a daycare center. Reducing the number of days per week you'll need to pay for daycare will help make it more affordable.

Encourage them to make friends.,
Build a support system.",How to Help a Blind or Visually Impaired Child Socialize1," Building social skills in encourages positive healthy development. Bonding with siblings, parents, and family members provides a social safety net for the child. Connecting with peers increases self-esteem, self-worth, confidence and independence.

Our social skills are also known as soft skills. Soft skills are needed while children interact with peer groups, teachers, and counselors at school, and with future employers as an adult. By teaching children these skills, you encourage positive growth and future success.;
, Before helping a child socialize, you must first identify goals and expectations. Establish what it means to both you and the child to have good social skills. This will help you understand what the child feels they need and expect in addition to your social standards.

A child who exhibits an extroverted personality may thrive more on social stimulation, and actively seek out a connection with others. A child who is more introverted and may need more encouragement to connect with others, and more alone time to recharge.
Get to know the child's personality and what they feel comfortable with, and provide unconditional support. Never force a child to do something they don’t feel comfortable with.
Those who are blind or visually impaired may sometimes feel that they are not as competent as their sighted peers. Be an advocate for them, and let them know that being visually impaired does not have to stop them from forming meaningful connections with others.

, Children who are blind often struggle to maintain conversations. A visually impaired child may have difficulty interpreting non-verbalized cues, and may feel reluctant to express their feelings or needs. They may need help learning how to engage in skills like carrying on a sustained conversation and staying engaged with another person. These are teachable skills, so work on them with your child.Practice taking turns speaking, asking questions, and being interested in what the other person is saying or doing.
If your child needs prompting, say, “I asked what you were doing, do you want to ask what I’m doing?”

, Blind children rely on words much more than other children do to express themselves. Help them express their thoughts, needs, and emotions by giving them the language to express themselves. Model how to express feelings by doing so yourself. For example, you can say, “I’m feeling frustrated because I cannot open this box.”Label their feelings for them and help them gain the knowledge and vocabulary of how to state their thoughts and feelings. For example, you can say, “You seem sad that you can’t go to school today because you’re sick.”

, Both in games and interactions, taking turns is an important skill that children learn. Teach your child to take turns with other children. Start with games so that they know that everyone gets a turn. Then, extend this to conversations. Tell them that it is impolite to only ask questions or only focus the conversation on themselves.Your child must learn when it is appropriate to comment or ask a question and when it is appropriate to listen. If your child often interrupts, say, “Please don’t interrupt me. Wait until I’m finished and then you can talk.”

, Push your child to make friends on their own without your help. Allow them to go to the park and play with other kids. Tell them to introduce themselves and then invite the children to play. Have your child invite another child over to play. Allow your child to initiate social interactions so that they can practice and make friends.Invite children to come over to your house. This way, your child will be in a familiar environment and play with children comfortably.
If an interaction goes poorly, talk about it with your child and brainstorm ways to improve for next time.

, Talk to other parents of visually impaired children. They can be a great source of information and support on what it’s like to have a blind child. Your children can also become playmates. Ask questions about what it was like while their child made friends and how they overcame challenges.Other parents can help you navigate problems, find resources, and give advice.
Connect with a local group or find a support group online.

Ask questions and listen well
;
, Your child needs to know how to deal with bullies who won't go away. Discuss how to handle the situation when it happens. Emphasize the importance of telling an adult, and tell them to come to you if adults refuse to help.


Teach games to handle bullies: staring and dismissing, pretending to mishear or not hear them, constantly asking them to repeat themselves, cheerfully agreeing with them, etc. This will make bullies less scary, and confusing them may make them leave.
The phrase ""I'm okay, you're mean"" was developed in the developmental disability community, and may be useful to your child.
Emphasize that bullying doesn't happen because something is wrong with the child.

, Your child needs to know that it's okay to be deaf, and there's nothing strange or defective about them. Don't allow ""deaf"" to become a bad word in your family.


Introduce them to deaf role models.
Teach their deafness as natural and acceptable, just like your allergy to shrimp or your son's love of silly hats.
Consider introducing older children to the Deaf community, which has a rich and wonderful culture all their own.

, These schools are made in order to give deaf children a chance to grow up in a healthy environment where they can learn to adapt to their deafness. Also, your child will be able to communicate with others using sign language, and they will have a better chance of understanding it than in a regular school.


If you cannot send your child to a school for deaf children, find a support group or club where she can meet other deaf children. Finding others like her can be crucial for her self-esteem.

, Listen well, treat your child with respect, and adopt the attitude that you'd like to see in your child. Your child learns from you, so if you can carry on a good conversation, your child will pick up those skills.

, Maybe the jocks are too judgmental and the popular kids are too exclusive, but the little nerdy girl or sweet autistic boy could be great friends. Your child may find quiet people and outcasts to be less intimidating and easier to relate to.

, It's best not to push your child too hard, because you could overwhelm them or feel like they need to make friends because you want them to. Take it slowly, and let the child move at their own pace.


One-on-one interactions might be easier for your child.
If your child is worried, try hanging out nearby while the two play together.

, Spend plenty of time together, ask about their day, and support them. A strong relationship with you will help give them confidence to face the world.

Build non-verbal communication skills.,
Teach personal space.,
Talk about facial expressions.",How to Help a Blind or Visually Impaired Child Socialize2," Talk about and identify common gestures used in speech. Teach your child how to gesture and explain why people use gestures while speaking. Discuss nonverbal behaviors and how they communicate sometimes just as much as words.For example, nonverbal cues can indicate interest or disinterest, such as moving closer or further from someone who is speaking. Learning nonverbal cues can help your child communicate more effectively.

, Help your child understand that people enjoy having some space around them. Many people are off put by someone being either too far or too close to them while they speak. Teach your child to gauge their distance by the other person’s voice. If they are too near someone, gently encourage them to back up a bit.If your child is not sure whether they are giving enough space or not, have them ask, “Am I crowding you?”

, Blind children miss out on reading expressions on people’s faces that can clue them in on how they feel. Practice making faces together and discussing how they feel and why a person might make that face. Guide them to make these expressions and to feel them on your face.Understanding expressions can help with understanding nonverbal cues and emotion.

Practice social interactions.,
Encourage friendships.,
Establish a buddy system.,
Create inclusive activities.,
Consider a social skills group.",How to Help a Blind or Visually Impaired Child Socialize3," Remember that a visually impaired children will need support and guidance in the classroom. Remember to use verbal descriptions and implement or talk to teachers about hand-over-hand instructional approaches, while working from behind the child.

Ask for or allow for additional time and repetition in the class. Ensure that the child is able to perform their social skills on their own in a new setting.
Verbalize what things, people, and/or activities you see in the environment. Be as descriptive as possible. Label feelings, facial expressions and gestures, or other visual cues to help you child interpret responses and attach them to verbal cues.

, Teach the blind student to listen and observe a group interaction before jumping in. if they immediately jump in with a question or comment, other children may be put off or think the child is rude. The child can listen for who is talking and for the pace of the conversation before joining. That way, they can enter seamlessly without interrupting or jarring the conversation.If they abruptly join a group, gently correct them by saying, “Let’s listen a bit longer before jumping in.”

, Use scripts and modeling to teach skills. This can help children learn the words, gestures, and manners behind getting someone’s attention, speaking up in class, making friends, and making requests. Adults can model behaviors and children can begin to learn and practice patterns of social interaction.For example, teach children to be polite and use manners and not depend on raising their voice to get someone’s attention.

, Encourage sighted children and blind children to become friends. Encourage small groups to help the child feel included and for the other children to get to know the blind child. If children are scared or do not know how to interact with someone who is a little different, this can help them to realize they are more alike than not.If classroom children are unfamiliar with blindness, have a parent or visually impaired adult come and speak to the classroom about what it means to be blind. This can help demystify blindness and take away any fears they might have.

, Have a buddy or a few mentors available to help the blind child interact socially. These people should model appropriate interactions and behavior. They can also show friendship skills and be companions for the child. Make sure the arrangement is set up to be cooperative and not about giving help to the blind child, as this may lead to dependence.These children can be buddies to the blind person and encourage positive interactions.
To keep the relationship balanced, the blind child might teach the children a skill or give help with homework.

, When doing group activities, make sure the blind child can participate. No child wants to feel isolated from an activity, especially a fun activity, so make some changes to include them. This might mean letting children work with a partner or making tasks easy to navigate without vision.Play games that don’t require sight, or have the child modify the game so that they can play. For example, if playing hangman in the classroom, have the blind child keep track of the letters on their own.

, Because blind children tend to struggle in social skills, enroll them in a social skills group. Many schools offer these groups, or they can be found at a local mental health clinic. The benefit of a social skills group at school is that children can befriend one another in the group.Social skills groups can teach children how to take turns speaking, how to begin a conversation, how to listen, and how to interact politely with others.

Find the beauty in stimming.",How to Handle Stimming in Autistic Children," Whenever you pace, fiddle with your hair, bite your pencil, or squeeze your hands, you're stimming. Stimming is both more necessary and more noticeable in autistic children, due to sensory issues.;
, If your child is stimming because of their feelings, then try to identify that feeling and respond to it appropriately. Think of emotional stimming like a facial expression—it's a way for them to express something.


""Well, you look excited today! Are you flapping because you're excited to see Grandma?""
""Is everything okay? You look unhappy.""
""Tommy, Lulu's making that sound because she's upset. Please stop getting in her personal space.""

, Unlike facial expressions, stims are not universal and can mean different things for different people. Notice the child's individual stims. They can give you clues to how they're doing, and can even show signs of oncoming meltdowns before they begin. Here are some example individual stims:


Noah flaps his arms when he feels overwhelmed.
Rachel paces whenever she falls into deep thought. Her parents know that usually an impromptu science project follows this, and are looking into science programs at her school.
Jamal used to bite his fingers when he was worried, until his dads helped him redirect to biting chewy jewelry.

, You can purchase them online, make them yourself, or repurpose common objects such as flashlights and string. Keep a box of stim toys in an accessible place where your child can easily get whatever they need.


For calmer trips out and about, ask a child to pick a stim toy from the box to take along.
Write down where you found each stim toy, in case they break or become misplaced.

, If a child is stimming so much that they can't focus, then they need more exercise. Go to playgrounds, set up a basketball in the driveway, go to pools, take family walks, and have plenty of sports equipment available for backyard sports. It may be worth purchasing a swing or playground set for your yard if possible.

, Stims such as biting, head-banging, and staring at the sun are detrimental to your child's health. You can talk with your child and their therapist about how to fulfill their needs in a less harmful manner.

, Your child may look strange, and they will appear disabled in public. This does not mean that you are a bad parent, it means that you have a disabled child. Learn to relax and stop worrying about whether others are judging you or the child. Your child will still be able to have a successful and happy life.


Inform your child that their behavior looks odd, using a neutral tone of voice to make it clear that you aren't ashamed. ""Most thirteen-year-olds don't carry stuffed animals to grocery stores. If that bothers you, you could go get a different stim toy from your box. But it's okay to be different, and I'm fine with either way you choose.""
Never try to change a behavior only because you find it embarrassing. If this is the case, it may be yourself who needs to change to accept others.

, If you know an event is going to be difficult, try giving the child some deep pressure (tight hugs, weighted blankets, massage, stacking things on them, etc.). Activity can help with releasing excess energy beforehand if this is often a problem for your child. Swinging and rocking may also help. Figure out which sensory activities can calm them or burn energy, depending on their individual needs and preferences.

, Stimming makes your child unique. It helps them connect to the world, and makes them special. Love the stims and love the child.
