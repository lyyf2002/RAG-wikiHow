Pay attention to children's school performance to watch for signs of disabilities.,
Consider enrolling a disabled student in a school that is specifically designed for those with the same impairment.,
Contact school administration for information on the disability services in your district.,
Register your disabled student with the program or office that supports disabled children.,
Create an Individual Education Plan (IEP) with the disability contact.,
Discuss the disability services with your child's teacher.,
Contact your school district or Section 504 Coordinator, if you believe that the necessary accommodations have not been made.",How to Get Help at School For a Disability1," While some disabilities are immediately apparent at birth, learning disabilities often appear in elementary school. Children may not know that they have a disability, so parents should watch for trouble reading, disciplinary problems, low-interest level and other indicators of a larger problem.


Go to the website of the National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities at nichcy.org/state-organization-search-by-state. You can find services that are available to school-aged children with disabilities.;
, Many states host schools for the blind, deaf or cognitively impaired. Request information about enrollment in these schools, to see if the disabled student is interested in attending a school that tailors the curriculum to work with any impairments.

, Many primary education districts have a special education director. Arrange a meeting with your school's disability contact.

, Many of these services are funded by federal or state aid, so they are required to keep track of specific services and student progress. Fill out all applicable forms to ensure your child will receive services when they need them.

, This should include services that are provided and a support network. Schedule appointments for evaluation of services during the semester, as well as at the end, after grades have been given.

, Before the start of the semester, you should schedule an appointment to speak with the teacher about the disability. This will help you to communicate any problems in the future and it also allows you to give extra support to the teacher.


The teacher may never have taught a student with this particular disability. There may need to be a period of trial and adjustment. You may be able to suggest ways to handle possible problems in the future.

, Request a copy of the school's disability requirements and request a meeting with school administration if those requirements are not being met. You may need to negotiate for some services, if the school cannot afford to adopt all the necessary disability services at once.

Establish rules and boundaries.,
Communicate your expectations.,
Be consistent.,
Help the child learn natural consequences.,
Teach the child logical consequences.,
Take away the child’s privileges.,
Identify your child’s challenging behaviors.,
Think about what is causing the behavior.,
Think about why your child is behaving this way.,

Pay attention to communication struggles.,
Think about reasons for behavioral differences.,
Put their behaviors in context.,
Try switching discipline methods.",How to Discipline a Blind or Visually Impaired Child," It is important that all children know what rules and boundaries exist within a particular setting, whether it is within the home, at school, or in a social setting. Clearly communicate these rules and expectations for behavior to the child., Once you establish rules and boundaries, you will want to communicate these to the child. Make sure the child understands the consequences for both good and bad behavior. For example, if the child does not do their homework, you might require them to spend extra time studying on the weekend., If you want a well-behaved child, you will need to be consistent with both rules and consequences. Once you establish rules, create consequences, and communicate your expectations to the child, you will need to be consistent. For example, if the child frequently refuses to practice orientation skills with their service dog, the consequence should be the same every time., Natural consequences are experiences that naturally occur after a behavior. For example, if the child breaks a toy, they will no longer be able to play with the toy. By refusing to go out and buy the child a new toy, you are helping them learn natural consequences., Logical consequences are those that you, as a parent or caregiver, set up to logically follow a specific behavior. Describe to your child what the consequences are for unacceptable behavior, and link the consequence directly to the behavior. For example, if the child does not help pick up their toys, then you will take those toys away for a set period of time., If there is not a logical or natural consequence for the child’s behavior, you can take away a privilege as a form of discipline. For example, if the child does not complete their homework on time, you can take away their music privileges for the evening., Think about the child’s behavior and identify those you find challenging. Consider each behavior individually. Think about where and when the behavior occurs, as well as who is involved when it happens., While you may initially react to a challenging behavior in a number of ways, it is important to take a step back and understand what is causing the behavior. Consider all the factors involved when the behavior occurs and why it might be happening., All behavior serves a purpose, and it is important to understand what the function of your child’s behavior is. Your child might behave in a certain way to gain attention, avoid situations or activities, or as a response to a sensory or physical experience., If you determine an emotional or environmental trigger causes the child’s behavior, you should work to change the child’s environment and remove the triggers. For example, if the extreme cold of the grocery store’s freezer isle causes your child to have a sensory reaction and subsequent meltdown, try avoiding that environment when shopping with the child., You can help your child modify these behaviors by increasing the positive attention your regularly give them, ignoring inappropriate behavior used to get attention, and working with the child to find ways to ask for what they want in a more appropriate manner., Once you figure out the root of the child’s behavior and whether or not there are emotional and environmental triggers involved, you can work on teaching the child a new behavior. This new behavior can replace the old one., If your child is engaging in self-destructive or potentially dangerous behaviors, you should consult the help of a professional immediately. A professional can help you create a plan to modify the behaviors under professional guidance., Challenging behavior from a blind or visually impaired child can happen because they are having a hard time using appropriate forms of communication. For example, challenging physical or vocal behaviors might occur because the child lacks:The ability to communicate needs and wants verbally and nonverbally
Skills to help them calm or soothe themselves
Speech and language skills
Social skills like playing with others, building friendships, and empathizing

, Blind and visually impaired children may exhibit challenging behaviors that are different from sighted children. There are certain risk factors that a blind or visually impaired child may have that affect their behavior such as:The child’s medical or neurological condition
Sensory impairment
Certain behavioral triggers like people or places
The child’s attachment, social, and emotional histories

, It is helpful to think about a child’s behavior within the context of changes in their motor, language, social, cognitive, and emotional skills. These changes happen from infancy through the teen years, and can sometimes be delayed in children who are blind or visually impaired. Putting behaviors in developmental context can help you understand their frustrations and help them cope with their emotions., If you discipline a blind or visually impaired child and it does not work, you should switch discipline methods. Think about the child’s specific developmental stage and the reason for the behavior. Then, discipline the child in a different way."

Ask for a contact at your high school.,
Research potential educational aides.,
Read the Americans with Disabilities Act.,
Join an online or local support group.",How to Get Help at School For a Disability2," Many disability services do not have offices at a high school. A school administrator, teacher or counselor can help you to deal with day to day issues that arise due to your disability.


This contact can also be an advocate. In case of problems, you can come up with a plan and discuss it with your individual teachers together.

, The rise of technology, including smart phones and computers with visual or audio cues may mean that you can be permitted to use educational devices during school hours. Discuss the possible adoption and purchase of aides to help you at school.


A school's disability program is tasked with providing services to a large variety of disabilities and within a budget. They are not always able to stay at the cutting edge of educational devices, so you should consider researching new technology and bringing it to their attention for the future.

, During high school, students should know their rights as a disabled person. In order to receive help in high school and later life, you will need to know what to ask for and what is required by law.

, By talking with people who have the same disabilities as you, it may be easier to deal with the struggles of your disability. Online disability support groups encourage conversations on things like educational aides, emotional situations and getting support from services or schools.

Apply for disability scholarships and programs.,
Contact the disability coordinator or office to arrange an appointment.,
Contact your school's Section 504 Coordinator if you feel there has been discrimination against you.",How to Get Help at School For a Disability3," In addition to the programs offered by the local school, the student may also be eligible for state or federally funded programs. Ask your disability contact to recommend these programs, or go online and search for disabled student scholarships.


Go to disabled-world.com/disability/education/scholarships to see a list of current scholarships that are available in the United States and around the world. Visit FinAid at finaid.org/otheraid/disabled.phtml to see more information about financial aid for students with disabilities.

, You should meet with the coordinator before classes begin, so that you can receive all available educational services and disability aides. Many disability offices are only able to provide help at the beginning of the semester, so do not wait until it is too late.


Some research suggests that many people with disabilities try to go without help when they first enroll. They may feel that they have been singled out for their disability too often in their life. You must be registered with the disability office in order to receive services. By the time a student recognizes the need for help, they may already be failing some classes.
Talk with your professors at the beginning of the semester about potential class modifications that are necessary with your disability. Although this may feel uncomfortable, it will help you to avoid future problems.

, Section 504 is the ""Protection from Discrimination"" part of the Americans with Disabilities Act. There are grievance procedures to correct these problems.

Recognize that aggression is not part and parcel of autism.,
Recognize general causes of aggression in autistic children.,
Look at disorders that could explain aggression.,
Recognize that sometimes physical issues can cause aggression.,
Keep ABC records of each incident.,
Ask autistic people for help.",How to Determine Why an Autistic Child Is Aggressive1," Autistic children are not automatically aggressive, and a child who is violent now may not be violent forever.Don't assume that this is par for the course—every autistic child is capable of being nonviolent in the right environment.


Autistic children tend to be less aggressive than other children on average, and are more reactive than proactive.;
, Children act out for different reasons: because they are under severe stress, because they don't understand that it's harmful, or because they have learned it from others or experimentation.



Severe distress. A child who is deeply upset may lash out. This may be caused by unmet needs, psychological disorders such as anxiety,or mistreatment.

Misunderstanding. Some sensory seekers hit because it feels good to them, and it doesn't occur to them that it feels bad to other people.

Learned behavior. The child is treated aggressively and thus learns that this is okay, or they try it once and discover that it gets them what they want.

, Some autistic children have co-occuring disorders that may make them more prone to violence.Oppositional defiant disorder.
Conduct disorder.
Disorders impacting impulse control.

, Take your child to the doctor for a comprehensive checkup, including blood panels. This is important even in children who can communicate well, because they may not understand or feel comfortable saying what is wrong. Aggression may have a physical source such as...


Pain from a medical condition
Food allergy/sensitivity
Diet/nutrition problems
Metabolic issues

, Write down Antecedents, Behaviors, and Consequences. Look for patterns, especially in what triggers the behavior and how others respond to it. What could be changed?Pay close attention to whether adults are escalating or de-escalating the situation.

, Autistic adults have brains that work similarly to your child's brain, so they may notice a problem in the child's life that you missed.


If possible, find an autistic mentor in the community who can meet your child and look at the environment.
The internet houses a strong Autistic community full of people who are happy to help families like yours. Try posting anonymously about your child's problem in the hashtag #AskAnAutistic, where autistic people can find you and offer advice.

Watch for abuse and mistreatment.,
Consider the child's ability to communicate.,
Consider whether the child's communication is treated like it's important.,
Pay close attention to what happens if a child says no.,
Look at whether the child's abilities are being respected.,
Consider whether the child's independence is supported.,
Consider if the sensory environment is overwhelming.,
Consider if their sensory needs are not being met.,
Take note of any major life events that might cause stress.,
Consider whether the child knows how to use coping mechanisms.,
Consider whether both the child and the nearby adults know how to manage crises.,
Think about whether your child has enough downtime.",How to Determine Why an Autistic Child Is Aggressive2," A child who is treated badly is going to have a lot of issues, including potential aggression. Keep in mind that parents are not the only ones who may be hurting the child—it may be perpetrated by family members, teachers, peers, or therapists. Many autistic people report experiencing therapy abuse in therapies such as ABA and DTT when they were younger.


Are adults regularly unkind or mean to the child?Do they hurt the child's self esteem?Is therapy compliance-based instead of cooperative?
Is the child ever grabbed or moved against their will? Are punishments harsh or painful (including sensory pain)?Does therapy involve power struggles or frequent tears?
Is the child being trained to act unnaturally (i.e., to mimic the behaviors of non-autistics)? Do therapy goals include extinguishing all stimming, hugging/kissing on command, or becoming ""indistinguishable from peers?""Does the child witness or experience bullying?

, Children should be able to communicate basic needs and feelings from a young age, using either speech or AAC. If they can't communicate reliably, then they may be dealing with unmet needs and extreme frustration.


Being able to communicate well is much more important than being able to speak. Speech should not be pushed at the expense of communication.

, If the child says something that is inconvenient to the adults around them, is it respected or ignored? A child needs to be able to bring up problems, and have them taken seriously.


Do adults only listen if the child communicates in a certain manner? For example, they ignore body language but not speech, or ignore speech that isn't phrased ""nicely."" Sometimes autistic children are too stressed to be able to communicate with sophistication, and thus can't do it a certain way.
Are their requests for help taken seriously? (This doesn't only apply to basic needs like water or food, but also help with situations like bullying.)

, Even if it can't be honored (such as cases in which health/safety is at stake), a child needs to know that their protests are heard and respected. This helps them understand that adults will always listen to them, even in tough times.Does the child know that they are allowed to say no and ""I can't""? If not, teach them how to do it.Is the child allowed to opt out of optional activities? For example, if they want to play alone, do adults force, cajole, or bribe them into playing with other children?
If they need to do something they don't like, are any explanations given? Does the adult try to make adjustments to make it better, and do they explain why it has to happen?
If something is uncomfortable or painful, do adults let them not do it? Or, if they have to do it, do adults do everything they can to make it more comfortable?

, Adults should presume competence, assuming that the child is a good and capable person. Helpful adults encourage the child's independence, and let them make choices about their lives.


Are they treated with respect, or with condescension?
Are they being forced, bribed, threatened, or tricked into doing things they can't handle or aren't ready for?
Are their strengths recognized, or are they spending all their lives working on their weaknesses?
Are they given schoolwork that is challenging enough? Autistic children, especially nonverbal or barely verbal ones, are often underestimated., Every child needs control over parts of their lives, and the ability to do things themselves. The child should be allowed some choice over their clothing, food, free time, schedule, and other aspects of life.If you notice the child struggling, don't swoop in right away. Let them try to figure it out. If they are clearly having a hard time, say ""If you need help, say 'I need help.'"" Then help them if they ask for it, or if they make a clear attempt to communicate with you (even if it doesn't go well).

, Hypersensitive children may find a chaotic environment frightening and stressful, and this may manifest itself as aggression. A sensitive child should be given a calm, predictable environment.


Remember that sensory pain is real pain, and children should be protected from it as much as possible. Don't try to desensitize a child without help from an occupational therapist trained in sensory integration therapy.
Don't expect your child to ""tough it out."" This usually makes things worse.

, Some children need a lot of activity. Exercise is often a helpful outlet, and they should consider sports, swimming, hiking, martial arts, and other ways to stay active.


Teach them that hitting, biting, and kicking hurts other people. The child might not know this, so break the news gently and firmly. Teach them to punch couches or push against walls instead of harming people.
Encourage the child to spend lots of time exploring and running around outdoors.
It may help to get some equipment such as trampolines, exercise balls, basketball hoops, swings, and other things they can use to burn off energy. If you see them getting restless, encourage them to go do one of these activities.

, Moving house, loss of a loved one (whether they died or simply left the child's life), going to a new school, divorce, trauma, and other large challenges may cause aggression and/or regression.


Is your child particularly upset about some event in their lives? Autistic children may have difficulty labeling their feelings, so notice changes in behavior and what the child talks about.
Did they have a recent change in behavior? Do you remember when?

, This can range from basic anger management skills to using calming stims. If the child doesn't know how to deal with anger, frustration, overwhelm, or other difficult emotions, try using social stories to teach strategies.


The problem may be more complicated than this. Try to work on both teaching the child and making the environment better.

, Adults need to know how to notice stress in the child, and de-escalate instead of making it worse.


Adults should be understanding, gentle, and kind when stress builds up. They should encourage the child to take a break to de-stress.
Physical activity can reduce the urge to act aggressive.
Repetitively thinking or hearing ""Don't do ____"" puts the image of doing the thing in the child's mind, so it can be counterproductive. Encourage the child to focus on a different action that causes no harm, such as putting their hands on their head., Autistic children often need a lot of time to relax and recharge. This time is often best spent alone or one-on-one, doing an activity of the child's choice.


Try making a calming down corner for your child, and encouraging them to retreat there when they are stressed or in need of relaxation.
Everyone needs privacy sometimes. Make sure that your child is getting enough.
Don't overdo therapy. Avoid giving them more than 2 hours per day. Your child also needs time to relax, have fun, and be a kid.

Install a wheelchair ramp.,
Provide stability and space in the bathroom.,
Include wheelchair-friendly features in your kitchen.,
Remove or tape down rugs and wires.,
Ensure open access to all parts of the house.,
Stabilize furniture and equipment.,
Secure loose objects.",How to Help a Child in a Wheelchair Thrive1," If any of the doors into your house require stairs, you need to make that entrance accessible. Even if there is another accessible entrance, making all entrances accessible maximizes the child's safety and gives them the same choices as able-bodied people.If a turn is required, make sure it's at least five feet (1.5 meters) square to allow room for the chair.
The ramp or path should be built far enough out to have a gentle slope up to the door.
Provide handrails on either side so the ramp is easier for the child to navigate, and make sure the entire area is well lit. You might consider setting lights on motion sensors so the child has a well-lit path without anyone needing to go ahead to turn on the lights for them.;
, Modifying a bathroom can be one of the more expensive projects to make your home safe and navigable for a child in a wheelchair, but these modifications are essential to enable the child to be independent.Install a roll-in or walk-in shower so the child does not need help climbing in and out of a tub. This will be especially important as the child gets older and develops a stronger sense of personal privacy.
Make sure your shower or tub includes a bench where the child can sit that is safe and doesn't get slick with soap and water.
Bars near the shower or tub and on either side of the toilet can help the child transition in and out of their chair.
You may have to move the water knobs and shower controls so that the child can easily reach them.
Provide enough room around the toilet so the child can use the toilet without assistance. There should be enough space for the child to turn the wheelchair around, including a 48- by 56-inch (122- by 142-centimeter) space in front of the toilet and at least 18 inches (46 centimeters) between the toilet and any side wall.

, Even though young children probably won't be cooking, you can include modifications in the kitchen that enable the child to get their own snacks and participate in creating family meals.Providing adjustable counters that can pull out for the child, or creating at least one wheelchair-height counter, will allow the child to participate in food preparation and other kitchen activities. This helps the child be more independent by enabling you to teach them how to prepare and cook healthy meals.
Arrange the kitchen so there is enough room for the child to turn around and freely navigate the space, even when appliances are open.
You may need to lower cabinet handles or drawers so the child can more easily reach them.

, A child in a wheelchair should be able to move around their home independently. Make sure pathways are clear, and there's nothing that the child could trip over or that could impede the wheelchair.In most cases, you should avoid area rugs. While an adult in a wheelchair may be capable of rolling over the edge of a rug, a child may not have the strength or control necessary to do this.
Install hard flooring or use low-pile carpeting so the chair can move smoothly from room to room.
Secure wires along the baseboards and run them around the wall, rather than leaving them across the floor.

, When arranging furniture, there should be enough room for the child in a wheelchair to move freely about the rooms – and from one room to another – without needing any assistance.Creating a full circle of space around each room may be the easiest option. This way the child can get to every part of the room.
If your home has two stories, the child's bedroom should be on the main floor. You may want to consider installing an elevator, although this is an expensive modification.
There should be at least 32 inches (81 centimeters) of clearance in doorways, and 42 inches (107 centimeters) of clearance in hallways.
Make sure all interior doors are accessible so the child can open and close them without assistance. You may have to lower door knobs so they are within reach.

, Choose heavy furniture that is relatively stable and can't be pulled over or moved if the child bumps into it or pulls on it. If you have lighter pieces that could potentially be a hazard, secure them to the wall or the floor.Avoid tables and furniture with sharp corners, or get corner protectors to cover them.
Tall shelves and other top-heavy pieces of furniture should be anchored to the wall so the child in a wheelchair can't topple them over.
Secure televisions, computers, and electronics to the table or shelf on which they sit so the child won't accidentally knock them down. This also gives the child the chance to use electronic devices independently.

, Loose objects, such as curios on shelves, can be hazardous to a child in a wheelchair. In addition to the hazard, you want the child to be able to manipulate and control objects independently, without having to ask for help.Avoid placing unsecured objects near the edge of tables or shelves where they could be easily knocked off.
You can use velcro for the child's toys and other items so they can more easily control them and put them back in their proper place when done.
Velcro or magnets also work for dinnerware and glasses, so the plate or bowl stays in place and the child can eat and drink independently.
You can find inexpensive rolls of adhesive velcro or magnet strips at most discount stores, or at crafting stores.
If you have cabinets or shelving units for the child, make sure the drawers are secured so the child can open and close them without pulling them out.

Know when symptoms begin appearing.,
Recognize symptoms of autism.,
Look out for symptoms that usually develop at specific ages.,
Assess your child’s gross and fine motor skills.,
Trust your instincts, but keep in mind that these symptoms do not necessarily mean your child has autism.",How to Diagnose Autism Early1," Some signs may begin to emerge as early as 6 to 12 months. Specialists tend to hold off giving a definite diagnosis until approximately 18 months. This is due to the patterns of autistic symptoms in early development. Some of the symptoms may fade in, and fade back out again.This spiking and diminishing of symptoms can occur up until approximately 24 months. Symptoms should be taken seriously, but some children show delays and then catch up developmentally by the time they're 24 months old.;
, The following are some signs that may point to autism in children between 12 and 24 months old. Remember, if you're in doubt, visit your local doctor. They will be able to refer you to the right specialist. Take note if your child:


Does not make eye contact.
Sleeps in an awkward position.
May be highly sensitive to certain sensory stimuli.
Talks in an unusual tone or pitch, this may be displayed though an unusual babble.
Carries around specific items for extended periods of time.
Makes repetitive movements with their body or hands (stimming), especially to express emotion or calm down.
Plays with toys in an abnormal fashion.
May appear under-active, or disinterested.
May be hard to soothe, not liking to be cuddled.
Shows signs of being highly fussy.

, Some symptoms only present themselves when your child reaches a certain age. If you are concerned your child may have autism, look for the symptoms listed in the previous step, and keep in mind how quickly your baby develops relative to his/her peers. Here are some symptoms of a definite delay::


Before 6 months: No big smiles or joyful expressions
Before 9 months: No mutual sharing of sounds, smiles or other expressions.
Before 12 months: Lack of response to his or her name, no gestures like waving, pointing or reaching in response to your own gestures.
Before 16 months: No spoken words.
Before 24 months: No original two-word phrases. May rely on echolalia. This does not include imitation.

, If your child is in school, ask their teacher about any motor skill issues.


Examples of fine motor skill problems include being unable to color correctly, or difficulty using scissors to cut paper.
A child with gross motor skills may take a long time to pack up books or put on jackets, and be the last one out to recess.

, You know your child better than anyone else in the world, which means that you are more likely to notice changes that a doctor can. If you truly have a gut feeling that something is abnormal, it does not hurt to visit a specialist or psychologist.


If you have any concerns, talk to a doctor who specializes in autism, rather than your normal medical provider.
Keep in mind that the abnormalities may be due to something else, such as ADHD, Sensory Processing Disorder, or anxiety.

Advocate for inclusion.,
Allow the child to choose.,
Encourage the child to do things for themselves.,
Help make schools and classrooms more accessible.,
Provide tools and adaptive materials.",How to Help a Child in a Wheelchair Thrive2," Children in wheelchairs often are segregated from other children, or may be singled out when they would rather just be treated like all the other children. As the parent or caretaker of a child in a wheelchair, it's part of your responsibility to stick up for them and their needs.Explain that just because the child may not be able to do things the same way able-bodied children can, that doesn't mean the child is incapable of doing those things alongside those children.
For example, you might say ""Olivia would like to play in the sand with the other children rather than having a separate sand table. Do you think you could move them together so she could talk and play with them?""
Since every child in a wheelchair is different, and has different needs and abilities, a program that worked for one child may not work for this one. Both in education and in extra-curricular activities, encourage an individualized approach that takes the specific child into consideration.
Be ready to correct people who approach the child based on stereotypes or misunderstandings they have about disabled children. Insist that the child be included in the same kinds of activities that able-bodied children enjoy, rather than being segregated into events exclusively for children with ""special needs."" It is important to make your child feel as though they can do anything that an able-bodied child can do. This attitude will be invaluable to them as they go through life.
For example, suppose you're with a child in a wheelchair at a swimming class, and one of the instructors tells you that there's a different class with only handicapped children that she should take instead. You can say ""I appreciate your concern, but there's no reason Bobby can't participate in the regular class. He only needs help getting in and out of the pool, and I'm here for that.""

, Where possible, give the child choices when it comes to engaging in activities or pursuing interests, rather than simply taking them somewhere or giving them something to do. You can help a child in a wheelchair thrive by giving them some measure of control over their life.For example, you may give the child choices of three different toys to play with inside in the afternoon.
You also may want to give the child a choice of after-school activities. Give them a chance to explore their own interests by asking them questions and finding activities locally that they can do.
There are many non-profit organizations that provide grants and other financial assistance to children in wheelchairs who want to pursue particular activities, such as swimming or horseback riding, that might be too expensive otherwise. Check your local community center or public library to find resources, or do an internet search. You can also look into the Wheelchair Sports Federation to find out about different kinds of wheelchair sports that your child could get involved in., Often, when people see a child in a wheelchair, they want to help by doing things for them. A child in a wheelchair is perfectly capable of participating in activities in their own way and at their own pace.This also means teaching other children that they should let the child do things on their own rather than giving them too much help. People often assume that people in wheelchairs need help when they don’t and are not sure how much help to offer. Teach the child to ask for help when they need it, and tell others not to help unless the child in a wheelchair specifically asks. It will be very useful for your child to know how to ask for help when they need it and how to let others know when they don’t need help.
For example, if you hear another child offering to do something for the child in a wheelchair, you might say ""Did Olivia ask you for help?"" If the child says no, you can say ""I appreciate that you want to help, but you have to let Olivia try to do it on her own. She knows now that she can ask you for help if she needs it.""
Encourage the child to do as much as they can, recognizing that sometimes partial participation is appropriate. For example, the child may not be able to dress herself completely, but can hold her arms over her head and then pull the shirt or sweater down.

, A child in a wheelchair will thrive in an educational environment where they can move around with the same ease as able-bodied children. Since you understand the child's needs, you are well-positioned to work with the child's teacher, or with school administrators, to ensure the child gets the most they can out of every learning experience.Keep in close contact with the child's teachers, and let them know that if they have any questions or concerns they should talk to you directly.
Arrange to tour the classroom and other facilities the child will use during the school year so you can make suggestions for enhanced accessibility.
For example, you might recommend the teacher make the aisles between all the desks wider, not just the aisle next to the handicapped desk, so the child in a wheelchair can move to other parts of the room and work with other students.

, Depending on the child's specific disability and motor-skills development, the child may need special tools so they can participate in an activity designed for able-bodied children.For example, if the child has difficulty gripping things, you might want to put tape around crayons and markers so they are easier for the child to grasp and hold.
Even if the child has limited motor skills, you still want to make sure the things you provide for the child are age appropriate. For example, a child who has difficulty gripping crayons or markers shouldn't be given baby crayons. Rather, you adapt the regular crayons so that child can use them.
You might want to install edges on tables where the child is working or playing, or use a lid or a cookie sheet to keep loose items contained so they don't get scattered out of the child's reach.
If you're unsure how to adapt a particular activity, ask the child. Older children typically are able to help you brainstorm ideas that would enable them to participate.

Find accessible vacation spots.,
Plan excursions in advance.,
Make arrangements when booking your trip.,
Schedule flights in the morning.,
Connect with a doctor at your destination.",How to Help a Child in a Wheelchair Thrive3," National laws in many countries, including the United States and Canada, require places of ""public accommodation"" (such as hotels and amusement parks) to be accessible to people in wheelchairs. However, some are more accessible than others.For example, if you enjoy skiing, there are many ski resorts in Colorado that have staff trained to provide adaptive, one-on-one skiing lessons for children with disabilities.
Many hotels have staff specifically trained to assist families traveling with children in wheelchairs, and may have activities in which the child can participate.
Resorts and vacation destinations with a focus on exploring and interacting with nature and the outdoors often have specific programs for children in wheelchairs.
Conduct research online or talk to other families with children in wheelchairs to learn about the best vacation spots that will allow the child to fully participate in activities.

, Children in wheelchairs can enjoy many of the same activities as able-bodied children, such as trick-or treating at Halloween. However, you typically have to do a little work in advance to make sure the child is able to fully participate.For example, if you want to take a child in a wheelchair trick-or-treating, you'll need to scout out a route in advance to make sure all the houses are accessible for that child. If you can't find an appropriately acceptable neighborhood, you may want to find alternative solutions, such as trick-or-treating at a shopping mall or participating in a local ""trunk or treat"" event that takes place in a parking lot.
Let the child take part in the planning so they're prepared for the event and know what to expect. Count on the child to let you know what you can do to help make the event more accessible and enjoyable for them.
Make sure you get the child's input to the extent appropriate before buying non-refundable tickets or otherwise committing to a particular event – especially if you are doing it solely for the child's benefit. It is important to include them in the decision-making process. Give them the power to choose what they want to do rather than forcing them to do something in which they're not interested.

, Making reservations online may not be an option if you are traveling with a child in a wheelchair. You need to talk to someone and explain the need for accommodations in advance so there won't be any unpleasant surprises.If you're flying to your destination, speak with someone on airline staff when you book the flight so you can explain the accommodations the child will need.
Try to arrive at the airport an hour earlier than you normally would, so you have time to go through security and get to your seats. Remember that airlines allow disabled passengers to board first.
If you're staying in a hotel at your destination, talk to hotel staff before you arrive rather than booking a room online. This way you can get direct confirmation that the room will be accessible for the child and have any specific requirements covered.

, Earlier flights are more likely to be on schedule than flights in the afternoon, and children tend to be better travelers in the morning when they have more energy and haven't already been exhausted by a full day.If at all possible, try to book direct flights. If you must have a layover, make sure airline staff understands that the child will need their wheelchair during the layover – otherwise, it may be checked all the way through to your destination.
Study airport layouts in advance so you'll be able to easily find your gates and navigate to baggage claim. You'll also want to know where snacks and drinks can be purchased once you go through security, in case the child needs anything on the plane.

, If you're traveling with a child in a wheelchair who has continuing medical needs, talk to the child's pediatrician to identify a doctor or specialist you can work with at your vacation destination in the event of an emergency.If you can get a recommendation from the child's regular pediatrician, you can talk to the doctor before travel so you can get to know them and they can learn more about the child's condition.
Carry the child's basic medical records with you when you travel, as well as a brief summary of the child's medical history.
Keep names, email addresses, and telephone numbers of all the child's healthcare providers handy in the event you need to get in touch with them quickly while you're out of town. It is also a good idea to keep a record of the places your child regular visits. Also, talk with your child about what to do and who to contact in case of an emergency.

Schedule regular check-ups for your child.,
Contact your doctor if you have recognized some symptoms of autism.,
Be aware that the diagnosis process can take time.,
Be prepared for a parental interview.,
Expect a medical examination.,
Schedule a hearing test and lead screening for your child.,
Understand that your doctor will most likely ask for an observational period.,
Depending on the test results, your doctor may choose to run some more tests.",How to Diagnose Autism Early2," Once your child is born, it's a good idea to regularly have your child screened up until the age of three. This will allow you to keep track of developmental milestones, making sure that your child is developing normally.

, If you have noticed signs like those listed in the previous method, make an appointment with a doctor who specifically deals with developmental issues in children. Make the appointment as soon as you spot symptoms, because early intervention can greatly increase your child’s ability to interact with others.Research has shown that intervening early on can improve a child's overall development.It has been shown that early treatment and education, allows autistic children to gain social skills.

, Diagnosing your child will not happen overnight, as there's unfortunately no single medical test to give you a definitive answer. Multiple evaluations will be used, and these will yield a more accurate diagnosis.

, A parental interview is when your doctor asks you questions about your child’s medial background, as well as about the symptoms that you have noticed. He or she may also ask you about your family’s medical and mental history. In particular, talk to the doctor about:


What symptoms you have noticed
When you began noticing the symptoms
How severe the symptoms are

, Your doctor will examine your child in the same way that your child would be examined during a normal doctors appointment. On top of the normal physical test, the doctor is likely to do:A neurological exam.
Genetic testing.
Other lab tests.

, If a child has trouble hearing, it can greatly affect her language and social skills. If there's a hearing impairment, you may not be dealing with autism at all, as hearing impairments can lead to similar symptoms to those of autism.

, Your child will be observed within various settings and environments. The doctor will be looking for abnormal behaviors, and how your child interacts with people around her.For example, one observational period may involve the doctor giving your child a specific toy and watching how your child plays with the toy.

, These tests include:


Cognitive assessments: This may be in the form of an intelligence test, or some sort of cognitive assessment.
Speech evaluation: A specialist will focus on your child's speech, and how she communicates. The specialist will be looking for symptoms directly related to autism. These may be strange tones, or lack of response to verbal cues.
Adaptive assessment: This will test your child's problem solving skills in real life scenarios. These can be tasks like feeding themselves, or simply testing their verbal skills.
Sensory-motor tasks: A physical therapist will observe your child's motor skills, and sensory processing skills.

Consider why it might be that you feel compelled to encourage your child to do things you wished you'd done.,
Confront all of your missed opportunities.,
Start to let go by asking yourself who you want to be now.,
Identify areas where you may have confused your desires with your child’s.,
Be very careful about transferring your own internalized sense of shame or lack onto your child.,
Find out what your child really cares about.,
Let your child explore his or her inner world without your overlay.,
Refocus on being a parent mentor, not a parent coach.,
Pursue your own dream.",How to Stop Living Through Your Child," It's essential to face up to the motivations that have caused you to feel as if you need to live through your child. The drive to live through your child is often a competing mixture of wanting the best for your child, confusing what is best with the dreams you considered were ideal for you, along with seeking the fulfillment of something dear to you that didn't eventuate. While it's easy to feel defensive, realize that this isn't a self-blame action––it's about recognition and acknowledgment of how you might be living through your child and reaching acceptance that things need to change.


First, be honest about any of your dreams that you never achieved. Clarity about this can be hard where you've built up a self-defense around something you missed out on or failed to do or finish just so that you can cope better. For example, you may shrug off the fact you missed a Broadway audition due to the flu but deep down you've remained completely devastated because you never auditioned again. Or perhaps a coach told you that you were too fumble-fingered to play baseball or too fat to do ballet, and you're ""avenging"" your personal hurt from long-passed judgments by pushing your child through the activity that you missed out on.
Second, identify which opportunity you missed out on that has transferred to a hyper-focus on your child's direction. Perhaps you never attended college or didn't finish your degree and you're now determined that your child won't ""make the same mistake."" The driver behind this is a fear that your child won't get a good job. Encouraging a child to do something (like attending college) that you believe will enhance his or her life and hopefully make things easier for him or her is a sign of supportive parenting; on the other hand, being driven by your own fears and sense of loss can cause you to overshoot the mark and force your child to see his or her destiny as only that which you've ordained. Or, you might raise the bar so high that only the very best will do, like getting into an ivy league school or becoming captain of the sport's team, even though your child shows neither interest nor aptitude.
Third, consider things from your childhood that you felt you were not allowed to act out, talk about or reveal because of family tension or taboos. Growing up, you may not have even tried to raise such issues, knowing it would be futile. The inability to act on hidden desires can often emerge later in life when you gain a form of control over another person, such as the parent-child relationship. Do you ever catch yourself saying to your child: ""I never got to do that, think yourself lucky young man/lady"" or simply find yourself thinking often that your children get enviable opportunities that you never had? More telling still, do you ever find yourself feeling jealous when your child gets close to or achieves the goal you've transferred to him or her?
Finally, notice whether you're disregarding your child's real talents, submerging them under your idea of ""preferred"" activities or options? While these might lead to gaining your dreams, they fail to allow for the natural expression of your child's own talents.;
, Before you can start focusing on the ways to disentangle your dreams from your child's life, give yourself the chance to let go of unfulfilled dreams and face the pain head on. This may feel painful, in fact it will feel like grieving, because you'll be passing through stages of denial, anger before hopefully reaching a place of acceptance, especially if you haven't really faced the underlying issues before.


Give yourself a chance to mourn your lost childhood. Acknowledge how much it hurt to miss out on or never pursue the dream that you held dear as a child and teen. Acknowledge how much it has rankled that you were never captain of the cheerleading squad or didn’t make that final round during the spelling bee. Simply letting yourself express the negative feelings about what you missed out on is an important beginning.
Often talking over your fears and sadness with someone who cares about you is a really good way to free yourself from carrying it around. First, you can let out the pain of your loss, while second, this person will often be able to reflect back to you all that you have achieved in spite of your sadness or anger at what you didn't do. Choose someone you know won't judge you and loves you unconditionally.

, Everyone has regrets about some things in life but it's how we react that makes all the difference. Carrying around the baggage of an unfulfilled past self can derail the rest of your life. If you've become too attached to making a sad story from your life, this process might be even harder because you've let the past define you. But the fact that it's hard is no excuse to stay stuck in this mindset driven by past loss. Focus on the parent you want to be rather than on the achievement you thought would once define you. Tell your inner/past child that it's time to move forward in order to celebrate the kind of parent you want to be. It's okay to want to nurture yourself and you will do this more effectively when you let the adult and parent self take charge.


It can help to find a ritual or ceremony that will help you to let go. For example, write down the dream that you had on a piece of paper. Fold the paper up and place it onto a paper boat. Take the boat down to a local river and set it free. As it floats away down the river, say an affirmation about letting go and moving forward with the rest of your life, unimpeded by the heartache of what didn't happen.
Turn your pain to gratitude. Once you have done something to ritually let go of your pain, think over the things that you have done in your life. There will be many achievements, even if you've refused to acknowledge them before. Parenting your child is a precious, ongoing achievement that you deserve to celebrate, along with the other elements of your life that you're proud about.

, Most likely if your child is school age, he or she has at least some aspects of independence and has talents of his or her own emerging or evident. Whether it's the ball field, ballroom or classroom, seek to identify the areas where you seem to have disregarded your child’s true wishes or talents and have transposed yourself in his or her place, seeking outcomes related to what you'd wished happened rather than what your child is best suited to doing or being.


Reflect upon how far you've been taking your desire to live through your children. For example, do you go so far as to push your child into pageants even though she has clearly stated she can’t stand them or is it subtler where you merely (and constantly) “suggest” that your son or daughter take an animal CPR class, which could hopefully lead to vet school in the future? Look for both the overt and subtle ways that you've been pushing your child in a definite, parent-defined direction.
Try standing in your child's shoes. In some cases, children who excel at something they absolutely hate or don't feel much connection with, do so because it is a ticket to time spent with a parent, time they're desperately craving and don't seem to be getting from the parent in any other area of their life. Hence, doing what mom or dad ask of the child equates with gaining the interest and attention of mom or dad, and conforming to doing more of it means getting even more attention. It's easy to confuse the child's actions with actual willingness or enjoyment to achieve the particular activity or goal. Moreover, if your child feels that your love is conditional on the achievement, your child risks never feeling good enough in your eyes.
Consider asking for an outside opinion. Sometimes it’s difficult to truly know if you're trying to live your dreams through your children or not. Ask your spouse or a close family member for an honest opinion, promising no comebacks for the feedback. For example, ask something like: ""Was I pushing too hard on the soccer field or did I lose it too quickly when a “B” came home on an English paper?"". If it's someone close to you, they'll be aware of your personal biases and goals and can factor that into your relationship with your child.

, If you expend endless energy focusing on the negatives in your child because you're terrified of other people seeing these aspects and associating them with you personally, you risk turning your child into a proxy for your own standing in society. By neglecting to help your child round out his or her strengths and weaknesses and forcing your child to focus only on certain personality traits that you feel are appropriate, you risk damaging your child's self-esteem permanently. Ultimately, trying to mold your child to be an ideal will damage your relationship now and into the future. Focus instead on guiding your child toward constructive behavior and self-expression while not making a big deal of the negatives.


Never be “ashamed” or “embarrassed” if your child fails. Children are fast and ready learners, so they will––and should––fail at endeavors from time to time. Failure is a teacher as much as success and the child who knows how it feels to fail and begin again will learn the resilience needed to thrive, realizing that it's not the end of the world to make mistakes. If you believe that your child’s performance or behavior is a direct reflection on who you are, you may be so embarrassed that you transfer your child's small failings into thinking that you must be a failure, wrongly making it all too personal. The repercussions of this unhealthy thinking pattern are devastating for both you and for your child, so learn to spot yourself falling for thinking like this and put an end to it each time.
Avoid boasting or bragging about your child’s accomplishments. On the flip side of failing, is when your child achieves a goal. Never take credit or conclude that it must be because he or she is your child or ""inherited your gift/brains."" While genetics play some role in how your child turns out, most of it is about nurturing the latent talents within each person and teaching each child to trust and rely on his or her own abilities. Rather than taking the glory, teach your child that personal effort is what improves everything. As well, see your child as an individual entity with his or her own unique talents and abilities, rather than as an extension of you.

, Rather than telling your child what to do, ask. Start by asking what he or she likes to do or wants to do. You may be very surprised at the answers. Broaden your questions to include current interests, friendships and hopes for the future. You need to open to hearing what you don't necessarily want to hear––be prepared to go with that and simply listen. You may realize that you've been a fantastic motivator but a poor listener.

, Remind yourself frequently that your child is not you and that expressing his or her talents is not a direct reflection of who you are or what you’ve achieved in life. By allowing your child to explore his or her own interests, no matter how far these stray from your own, you provide a safe learning environment that will eventually enable your child to open up his or her best potential.


Be open minded when your child has different interests. Set aside your own qualms––perhaps he or she loves bugs and everything about them, but growing up you thought bugs were disgusting. Instead of trying to steer your child away from the insect interest, embrace it and seek to learn more about what excites and thrills him or her. For all you know, this could be a period of growth and better self-understanding for you too!
Encourage your child's own self-perpetuated expectations so that he or she learns how to live up to goals that are self-set, even if these amount to a ""just a phase"" in the end. It's the process of learning to be passionate about something, learning both the pitfalls and exciting things, and then finding a happy medium that needs to be supported by you as guide and mentor. Realizing that children grow out of interests is also an important part of not forcing a child to stay trapped in an obsession of your own.

, Perhaps you have felt rather overwhelmed and completely consumed by parenting; with all the media expectations laid on parents, feelings of needing to be a perfect parent can easily take hold and lead you to overdo the parental involvement. From ongoing sports schedules and after school activities, to play dates and sleepovers, it's easy to lose yourself in your child’s life. Yet, both you and your child need downtime, time off parenting for you and time off performing for your child. By taking a renewed focus on your role as a parent as a mentor rather than a constant coach, you will gain yourself some more time to work on the things that mean a lot to you (besides your child!), as well as giving your child more breathing space to develop his or her own destiny. And never forget that regular unsupervised play is an essential part of childhood.


Take a walk down memory lane and recall what made you happy before your parenting perfectionism took over. Did you enjoy painting or playing the guitar? Or were you an avid runner but you hung up your shoes after the children arrived? If you're hyper-focused on your children, perhaps now you have enough time to redirect that focus back to what made you happy.
Don't be afraid to reach out for help. Babysitters, friends, family and others are all available to help you talk through things, to give you space and time to spend away from constant parenting activities and to simply give you a break from trying to be ever present for your children.
Embrace your own relationships. Before kids you may have had an entire world of social connections, but if it now feels as if you're more focused on your child's relationships rather than your own, you've invested too deeply in your child's life at the expense of your own. Instead of stewing over your child’s social status, redirect most of your attention to your adult relationships. Nurture connections with not only friends but also your spouse or partner. By modeling good, healthy relationships with others, your child will see how it is possible to maintain friendships and relationships while juggling the rest of life, instead of feeling like he or she is the only focus in your life.

, Who said that it’s completely over now that you're a parent? This sort of talk is negative and often stems from letting misguided ideas of other people's expectations dampen your enthusiasm and will. If you still regret not achieving your dream or goal, seriously consider going back after it. Instead of making your child a pawn in what you want out of life, cut him or her free and go after that dream––or a variant of it––yourself. It’s never too late when you've the will and determination to step up to the challenge. After all, you've been making your child do this for a while, so show your child you really mean to change.

Check with your local school system and your pediatrician for referrals to support groups that can provide your child with opportunities to practice their social skills and learn to adapt to a neurotypical world.",How to Find Support for an Autistic Child," Your child's pediatrician can provide you with information about autism that will help you relate to your child. He or she can also make referrals to specialists whose work focuses on children with special needs.


Specialists who work with autistic children include developmental pediatricians, pediatric neurologists who focus on developmental disabilities, and mental health specialists (counselors, psychologists, and psychiatrists) who work specifically with children.;
, The school's social worker or special education coordinator can help you figure out how the school can help your child.


Under the federal law, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), children with special educational needs are provided early and on-going intervention from birth to 18 years old. Your local public school system can evaluate your child and develop a customized educational plan.
Other services provided by local schools under IDEA include speech therapy, counseling, and behavior management intervention. Evaluations and services are free of charge in public schools. You can also contact the National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities (NICHCY) for assistance in getting your child early intervention services.
You can learn about treatment facilities and programs during interactions with your child's special education team and medical caregivers.
Even when your child goes to college, he or she can still find support. Many colleges have disability centers where they can offer accommodations to disabled students.

,


Research the websites of national autism organizations to find resources in your area.

, Some operate on very dangerous ideologies that can hurt your child's self-esteem or destroy their ability to function.


Be wary of organizations that demonize autism, don't have autistic people in their leadership,or are loudly criticized by autistic people.Think about their rhetoric: ""Would I want anyone to treat my child this way (now or in the future)?"" You may be dealing with a hate group.Research therapies closely for ethical violations. Compliance therapies may focus more on being ""normal"" and submitting to authority,something that can hurt or destroy your child.Don't pursue therapies that use Quiet Hands,or use restraint and seclusion techniques., Most autistic adults have gone through treatments themselves, and can offer insights on what is most effective. There is a large community of autistic bloggers online who write extensively about treating children. Autistic-run organizations also offer great resources and advice.

Try resources like Musings of an Aspie, Emma's Hope Book, We Are Like Your Child, Parenting Autistic Children with Love and Acceptance, and more.
Autistic-run organizations include the Autism Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) and the Autism Women's Network. Britain's National Autistic Society is run partially by autistic people.

Introduce your child to another child with bipolar disorder to provide companionship.",How to Get a Bipolar Child to Take Medication," Whenever your child resists medication, be clear that it is a part of their treatment and they have to take it in order to get well.


You can help the child understand the importance of their medication.
Be firm and consistent if your child cries, throws tantrums, or misbehaves.
Avoid backing down from your position, as this can lead the child to believe that you can be manipulated by his/her behaviors.
However, do not shout or show aggression or anger while insisting that your child take their medication.
Showing aggression can further entrench and irritate the child, so stay very calm to help build trust with your child.;
, According to the age of your child, give him/her guidance about their disorder and how they can relieve their symptoms with medication. Giving your child guidance will help them understand:


Why taking the medication is important, and the consequences of skipping a dose.
That you, the parents, are being strict and assertive for the benefit of the child.
For example, if you have a young child, you can tell them that their mood will be improved if they take their medication. If you have a teenager, you can explain the whole disorder, along with the health consequences of rejecting medication.

, Help your child understand that with the help of medication, he or she can lead a normal life.


Do not exaggerate the illness, not minimize the effect of the symptoms.
Depending on the age of your child, tell him/her about the symptoms and how the medication will help control those symptoms.
Always give hope to the child about the positive effects of the medication to motivate him/her regarding their treatment and medication.

, If your child refuses to listen to your advice, get a counselor to provide unbiased advice about the medication, the child's apprehensions, and the child's refusal to take their medication.


Often, counseling can help children who are unable to talk openly with their parents about their disorder. Counseling can provide help in the following areas:

The child’s non-compliance and its reasons.
Family issues and their relationship with non-compliance with medication.
Behavioral issues leading to issues with medication compliance.
The child’s apprehensions about medications.
The benefits of taking medication.



, After some counseling sessions, you will have an idea about your child's thoughts and worries regarding their medication.


Address these apprehensions one by one.
Some of the common apprehensions your child might have are:

Your child, especially if they are preteen or teenaged, might be worried about the side effects of medications.
Some children do not like the taste of the medicine, which is usually lithium.
Irritation due to constant use of medications.
No clear indication about the duration of medication.



, Try to build a positive association with the medication.


For example, after a meal, ask your child to take their medication before getting his or her favorite dessert.
This will help the child associate positive feelings with taking their medication.
It can be easy to handle young children this way.
If you have a teenager, you could allow your child to go out with a friend or buy something nice.

, With your child, track their symptoms' improvement as a result of their medication with a symptom monitoring kit.


This is very important, as it helps your child gain insight about how their medication helps them.
It will also motivate the child about his/her progress and enhance their desire to take their medication.
You can use a mood symptoms chart, where the child rates his mood each day on a 1-10 rating scale.
You can write down the symptoms the child is having and then help the child monitor his or her progress as the symptoms decrease during usage of medication.
The daily chart can also be used to track improvements to the child's daily routine, highlighting tasks that they were unable to accomplish at first, but can now accomplish.

, A cost benefit analysis can help your child see if the benefits of taking the medication outweigh the costs.


You can do it by making two columns.
Write costs in one column and benefits in the other column, then help the child identify them both to understand why and how the medication is beneficial.

, A schedule will help the child take medication as a routine part of life, similar to eating and drinking.


Following the same time and routine for taking medication often helps the child take their medication regularly.
This can also help monitor the the results of taking medication and motivate the child to take their medication.

, Different children respond to medicines differently.


When your child starts taking medication, the side effects can be severe and disturbing.
Your child may experience tremors, seizures, muscle stiffness, abdominal distress, diarrhea, blurred vision, fatigue, heart problems, nausea.
Assure your child that these side effects are temporary and will naturally decrease as their body adapts to taking the medication.
In case of severe and intolerable side effects, talk to your child's doctor.

, Introducing your child to another person with bipolar disorder can make them feel less isolated.


When they find someone who has the same problem as them, they might feel a sense of relief knowing that they are not all alone.
They may feel an increased sense support and empathy.

Each assistance program has a unique set of guidelines for qualifying for a service animal. However, most of these processes are similar.


Generally, you will need to complete an application for a child to receive a service animal. In this form you will need to provide basic information like the name and address of the parent(s) and child.
You will also need to provide information about the child’s physical therapist, occupational therapist, psychologist, and/or case manager.;
, This will include a description of your child's autism and the severity of various symptoms, along with any additional medical problems.


At this point, you will also need to explain how your child's autism and/or medical problems are affecting their daily living skills and creating limitations. Daily living skills include caring for oneself (i.e. bathing, dressing, and feeding oneself).
You will also need to describe any restrictions or precautions your child may have related to their diagnosis and provide details on any medical treatments or medications they are currently undergoing.
You should also note whether you child uses any adaptive equipment, such as crutches or a wheelchair.

, The next section of the application will assess whether you are able to care for a dog. The agency will need to know who lives in the household, if you have any other pets, and the type of service animal you are seeking.


They also need to know who will be handling the dog (parent or child?) and if you will be able to provide food and grooming for the dog.

, In the final part of the application form, the assistance agency needs to know what kind of service you expect the dog to provide. You should should also indicate whether the dog will be attending school with the child, and how you feel that the child would benefit from the service dog.

, Applicants may be charged a fee from $20-40 as a basic processing fee. The agency will also require a professional to certify the diagnosis you report.


The agency will also often request letters of reference. This would preferably come from professionals that work with your child.

For example, they may ask to contact occupational, speech, or psychology therapists that can confirm your child's disability has and describe the ways in which a service dog could help to improve their life.



, All applications will need to be reviewed by the director of the organization before any decisions are made.


If the executive determines that the child meets all the qualifications and has shown a sufficient need (for services that the animal can fulfill), the family and child will progress to the interview.
The interview is primarily to determine which specific training tasks the dog will need to be taught.

, After the interview is complete, the agency will provide a contract and discuss fundraising plans with you and your family. During this time, it is important to read all parts of the contract and be sensible about what your family can afford and how much money you can realistically fundraise.


The contract also informs the family of the agency's obligations and their expectations of the family. Pay special attention to any aspects of the contract that may become invalid in various circumstances.
If you decide this is the best path forward for you and your child, go ahead and sign the contract. After this you have officially become a client of the agency of your choosing.

, Having a service animal trained specifically for your child is a relatively expensive process. This is why it is important for the family to fundraise.


You could try organizing community events, like a special dinner or bake sale, in order to raise money. This is a great opportunity to allow the community to help the family and the child.
You can ask friends, family, neighbors, and acquaintances to support autism by donating to your child’s cause.

, Applying for grants may seem like an unlikely source of income, but it is often more successful than you might think. There are both private (company) and government grants.


For example, there are grants from the state of California which pay for the dogs’ food, and many private grants which contribute to the training and care of service animals.
For more information about applying for grants, go to extraordinarydogs.org..

, Crowdfunding is a relatively new source for raising money. Crowdfunding comes in various forms, as provided by sites like Kickstarter and Gofundme.


To start crowdfunding, set up a site and use social media to let family and friends know that you are raising money for an autism service dog.
These sites also connect people who need money with those who have money and are looking to donate to worthy causes.

, After your family has raised all the funds necessary to fund the service dog program, both child and parents will enter the education process. This is where the family is placed in a class to train with their service dog.


During this time, you and your child will work with many different dogs until you find an animal that is a good fit for your child's specific needs.
Once the right dog is matched with your family, the last 4 to 5 months will focus on child-specific training.

, The final phase of training unites the dog and the child and family for a final training period.


This training is often provided by the training director, experienced trainers, or interns under the supervision of the director. This phase of training lasts 1-2 weeks and is the most intense part of the process.
After this phase is complete, you and your child will be able to take your new service dog home.

, Autism assistance dogs offer a variety of services that improve the lives of autistic children. Autism assistance dogs can work as a security item.The dog will allow the child to feel safe and help them to child sleep without their parents with little to no crying.

, Autistic children sometimes do not know how to demonstrate their love. Service dogs encourage an affectionate relationship between dog and child, and this learning can carry into other relationships in the child's life.


Some autistic children will never be able to physically show affection due to sensory issues. However, this does not mean that they cannot express it through speech, writing, or alternative forms of communication.

, Another behavior that is common in autistic children is wandering away from parents. These children often don’t understand or see the necessity of staying with their parents, which can lead to stressful situations for the parents.


Allowing the child to hold onto the dog, or even tethering the child to the dog, can prevent the child from wandering off, as the dog is trained to stay near the parents.
Additionally, the service dog will help to ensure the child's safety when crossing the street. While an autistic child might attempt to run into a busy street, the service dog is trained to sit on the sidewalk until the road is clear and it is safe to cross.

, Allowing the service dog to accompany the child to school can help the child to remain with the rest of the class and not wander off. This can improve the child's relations with their teachers and help them to stay more engaged during class.


Service dogs have even been shown to limit the number of meltdowns that autistic children experience in school. This is because the dog provides a comforting, familiar presence which calms the child.
The dog also provides a source of unconditional love and acceptance, which the child may not get from students, teachers, or even therapists., This ensures control over the dog and prevents the dog from disrupting the environment. Also be aware that public schooling does not usually provide a handler for the dog.

, Each autistic child is unique, so the service dogs are often trained to work specifically for your child's needs. This ensures that the dog will be equipped to deal with the individual problems or concerns of the child.

, This is usually referred to as an owner trained service dog. Before beginning, know your boundaries to training a dog and be willing to work with a local dog trainer.

You may have heard frightening stereotypes or stories that make you worry for your child's future.


Worries are normal, and okay. It's a lot to take in. You will be able to handle it.;
, Look to parents of disabled children, and disabled people who can remember their own childhoods. Both groups of people can offer advice and support. The parents have had the same parenting challenges that you will face, and the disabled people can remember their childhoods and what worked (and didn't work) for them.


If in-person resources are limited, look to the internet.

, Reading about the disability can help you understand what your child is going through, and be prepared for the various challenges you and your child will face. Being informed will help you understand what is going on.

, Look for someone who has experience in cases like your child's, who listens carefully to you (and your child too), and has a helpful attitude. A good specialist can be an incredible resource to you and your child.

, Your child may not meet the standard developmental timeline, and that's okay. Prepare to change your expectations and be patient with your child. Celebrate the little victories, and quit worrying about what the kids next door can do.


Be prepared to be patient and slow down.

, Your child might be paying closer attention, and trying harder, than you realize. Act with the assumption that your child can understand what you say, and that they want to succeed. They will grow and rise to meet your expectations.


Talk to them regularly, even if the conversation is fairly one-sided. Watch their body language. If you say ""Did you play with your friends?"" and they giggle and smile, they've given you their answer.
Some children don't look at a person while they are listening to them. If your child is in earshot of you, assume they are listening. (Say their name and get in their line of sight to ensure that they are paying attention.)

, Personal space and other boundaries are very important things to understand, and will greatly improve your child's social skills. Teach things like ""don't push"" and ""don't play with your sister's hair if she says no."" Don't let other people (including adults) cross your child's boundaries (e.g. forcing eye contact, hugging when they don't want hugs). This teaches your child that ""no"" is important, and that other people deserve respect.


All children need to learn this. Knowledge about boundaries will help your child socialize, and will also help arm them against the abuse (because the child will recognize that something is wrong). Teach your child to get help if someone violates their boundaries, even if it's as simple as a kid pulling their hair.

, If your child can't count change yet, it wouldn't make sense to have them learn multiplication with their same-age peers. Similarly, if your five-year-old is a fluent reader, give them children's chapter books. Tailor your lessons to your child's unique abilities, and focus on what their personal next step is (not what their peers are learning).

, If your child gets overwhelmed easily, get earplugs and brimmed hats. If your child hits their legs, get them deep pressure cushions. You can get ideas from your specialist, parents, and disabled people. Work on brainstorming solutions to individual problems.

, You are the expert on your child, and you have loving intuition about what will help them and what will hurt them. If a specialist recommends something that you don't feel is helpful, appropriate, or ethical, then this is worth talking about. A good specialist will listen to your concerns and take your point of view seriously.


If your specialist condescends to you, hides information from you, brushes you off, or suggests treatments that make you feel queasy (e.g. chelation or compliance training), this is not a good specialist.

, Your child has challenges and weak points—and also strong points and lovable quirks. Look at your child and remind yourself of all the things you are grateful for, and all the reasons your child is easy to love. Parenting a disabled child is not easy (parenting never is), but any parent would tell you that they would never replace their child.

Prior to signing your child up with any child care provider, licensed or not, drive to their business or home address.,
Know what to look for if it's a home-based care provider.,
Know what to look for if it's a commercial establishment.",How to Select a Safe Child Care Provider1," It is best to visit in the afternoon/evening/late evening hours. Examine the location with just as much care as you would if you were considering purchasing the property.


Park your vehicle where it won't be easily seen by the provider or their staff, and walk around the neighborhood. As you walk, listen to the noise level and note the conditions of the establishment/home and neighboring properties.;
, There are some key things to consider if the care is from someone else's home:


Note how many people appear to be living on the premises. A crowded driveway or house may indicate that your child will be exposed to a much larger group of people than may be advertised. If you aren't comfortable with random strangers coming and going through the home while your child is in the provider's custody, your child will likely not be/feel safe in that environment.
Note the condition of any people you see near the home, and the impression you get of them in your gut. If you feel uncomfortable being on the street with the people you see, your child will likely not be safe in the custody of this provider.
Note the condition of the residence and neighboring homes or buildings. If the home, or surrounding homes or buildings, are derelict, you will need to discover the reason for the conditions as they are and what extra safeguards the child care provider has in place to keep your child safe from injury, and from contact with unsavory neighborhood characters.

, If you're considering a business-run child care establishment, here are some things to take note of:


Walk around the building. Note the condition of the building to make sure it is not in disrepair in areas not easily seen from the street. Look up at windows/roofs and see if there are signs of dangerous conditions. Notice peeling paint/shingles, fallen gutters, cracked window glass, and unsafe entry/exit points. If you would be leery about purchasing the building, find a more suitable place for your child to spend their days.
Take note of any people you observe in the immediate vicinity and what impression they make on you. If you don't feel completely safe and comfortable interacting with the people around you, there are safer places to place your child.

Address other psychological conditions.",How to Diagnose Conduct Disorder," A child diagnosed with conduct disorder may bully, threaten, or intimidate others. This person may engage in or initiate physical fights.For the child with CD, he or she may “get a rise” out of causing harm to other people.


Think about how this child treats peers and/or siblings. Does he or she often pick fights or use threats? Is violence used as a means to get what he or she wants?;
, Those with CD may escalate violent or aggressive behaviors. They may use a weapon in an act of aggression that can cause serious harm to another person. Examples of weapons include a brick, bat, broken bottle, knife, gun, or any other item that could be dangerous.When situations have been violent, has the child or adolescent used a weapon? What kind of weapon? Does he or she often use a weapon to threaten another person?

, This child may be especially cruel toward people and animals. This can include doing very mean things to other children or to family members. The child may trap insects and animals and perform sick “experiments” on them or find ways to kill them (such as removing a spider’s legs, cutting centipedes in half, burning the fur off of an animal, hitting small animals with BB guns, etc).Do you notice the child or adolescent being fascinated with cruelty? Does he or she enjoy hurting people or animals?
Keep in mind that one instance of cruelty towards insects should not be a cause for concern. For example, pouring salt on a slug or using a magnifying glass on ants to see what will happen is not something to worry about. You need only be concerned if the cruel behavior is ongoing.

, Keep in mind that people with CD may steal. This can include mugging, purse snatching, extortion, and armed robbery.Do you notice the child or adolescent coming home with belongings that are not his or her own? When asked about them, does he or she avoid the subject or come across as suspicious? Does he or she seem to enjoy watching people respond in fear?

, A child or adolescent with CD may force others into sexual activity.This can include forcing someone to perform a sexual act or do something of a sexual nature of which the person does not want to do. A person with CD may threaten or coerce someone physically and/or with words into doing something of a sexual nature.


Have there been any reports made about the child or adolescent’s sexual activity? Is the legal system involved?

, There may be a fascination with fire and/or destruction. If the child sets fires, the intention is to cause serious harm or damage. He or she may set fire to homes, sheds, school, or other buildings., Outside of fire starting, the child or adolescent may deliberately destroy property. This can include stealing things out of people’s lawns or yards, breaking windows or doors, or altering a building or property in a destructive way.The child or adolescent may break into a house, car, or property. The individual may target someone or perform the act randomly. The motivation of the break-in may not be clear., Some children or adolescents with CD run away from home overnight or for multiple days.The child may run to a friend’s house, or board a bus and travel. He or she may meet up with someone from the internet and travel with that person.


Does the child talk about leaving the home or meeting someone that lives far away? Monitor the child’s internet activity and note any indication that he or she plans to meet up with someone.

, Starting before the age of 13, the child may be truant from school. He or she may skip school altogether or leave midday. The child or adolescent may say he or she attended school, but school authorities may say that the child skipped or was seen leaving the school property., The child or adolescent may stay out late beyond parental or city curfew. This type of behavior occurs before the age of 13. The child may leave the house and not tell parents, be at another friend’s house or wander in the streets.Does the child leave without telling parents his or her whereabouts? Is it unclear where the child is going?

, A mental health professional will ask about when symptoms are present. Symptoms will cause significant impairment in social, academic, occupational, and home environments.The symptoms may differ in the environments, however, the effects of these impairments may greatly influence the child’s ability to function and succeed with peers, at home, or academically.


Think about how the child acts and home and at school. What have teachers said about his or her behavior? Communicate these problems to the professional.

, It’s important to know when problems started and to communicate this with the professional. With conduct disorder, typical onset occurs during childhood or adolescence. To specify childhood onset, the child must show one or more symptom prior to the age of 10. In adolescent onset, adolescents show no symptoms prior to the age of 10.When did you first notice signs of conduct disorder? What were the first signs of problems and when did they start?

, If the child displays a consistent negative pattern of emotional and social functioning, this may be discussed with the professional for diagnosis. Some common social problems associated with conduct disorder include:Lack of guilt or remorse: The individual shows a lack of concern for his or her behaviors and negative consequences of them. The person may show no remorse unless caught in the act, and the remorse may be forced or appear fake.

Callousness, lack of empathy: The person may disregard or lack concern for the feelings of other people. He or she may be seen as cold or uncaring toward others. If the child causes harm to another being, he or she may be more concerned with consequences than the harm caused toward another, even if the actions have caused substantial harm to another.

No concern for performance: This person may not care about his or her performance at work, school, or other environments. Even when expectations are clear, the individual may not put forth effort to perform well, or blame others for the lack of performance.

Shallow affect: The child or adolescent may show little to no emotion. If emotion is displayed, it may come across as shallow, insincere, or superficial. The person may use emotions as manipulation and be able to turn emotions on and off to fit situations.

, When a professional determines conduct disorder, the severity of symptoms is specified. Symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe. A mild diagnosis means that the child exhibits few problems that cause relatively minor harm to others. A moderate diagnosis means that symptoms are present, yet not extreme enough as a severe diagnosis and above a mild diagnosis. This can include stealing without confronting the victim or vandalism. A severe diagnosis means that many problems exist in excess of those required to make a diagnosis. The symptoms cause considerable harm to others, such as forced sex, physical cruelty, use of a weapon.Think about the impact the child has on other people and on the self. How much to these behaviors influence the self and others?

, It’s not uncommon for children or adolescents with CD to have some degree of co-occurring drug use. If this is the case, it’s important to bring up the drug use to the treating professional (such as a therapist or psychiatrist). Especially if the child or teen is receiving psychological treatment, it’s important to treat the substance use first prior to treating behavior symptoms.For some children, using drugs may be an escape from experiencing the pain inside that he or she may be fearful to face.
For more information, check out How to Find Substance Abuse Treatment.

, If the individual is over 18 years old, the professional will rule out the presence of antisocial personality disorder. Likewise, if the individual is approaching the age of 18, see if symptoms more clearly fit into symptoms of antisocial personality disorder. Children with conduct disorder may go on to fit a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as adults.For more information, check out How to Recognize Someone With Antisocial Personality Disorder.

, When discussing the diagnosis with a mental health professional, make sure to ask questions so that you can understand the diagnosis as best as you can. You may ask about how to follow up with treatment, what steps you can take to ensure the child’s safety, and how that you can help the child have a better prognosis.


The next step following diagnosis includes obtaining treatment. Conduct disorder will not go away on its own and requires therapy.
Treatment often includes a combination of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) and parent education and training.A therapist specializing in conduct disorder will often approach the problem holistically, meaning that he or she may gather information from schools, peers, the community, and the legal system to best understand the child’s problems and how to improve them.For more information, check out How to Treat Conduct Disorder.

, After receiving a diagnosis of conduct disorder, parents may feel like they have let their child down or have not been “good enough”. Likewise, parents may feel at the end of their ropes in handling the child’s behavior, ultimately feeling hopeless or helpless in dealing with the child. Parents may blame the child for the bad behavior or resent the child. While having a child with CD is difficult, it’s important to eliminate blame and find better ways to cope with difficult situations.Parents can play a role in treatment by learning through modeling or role playing with a therapist. Skills such as how to more effectively monitor their child’s behavior and supervise their child can be learned.

, Often, a child with CD may have other mental health problems as well, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD can develop as a result of witnessing or experiencing violence in the home, which can have a lasting and damaging impact on the child. Some children with CD may experience serious depression and/or anxiety, which can make the child feel agitated or irritable.Effective treatment for conduct disorder includes treating any other existing psychological condition in therapy.Recognize that the child’s emotional experience is not pleasant, and that having CD and other disorders may be painful. While the child’s behavior may be frustrating, remember that the child is having a hard time, even when it may seem like the child doesn't care.

Go online and check for possible sex offenders.,
Call your local police department's non-emergency telephone number and ask for background checks on each family member residing in the home of the prospective provider.,
If you're looking at using a commercial day care provider, do an online search for the names of employees, the provider and their associates.,
If you aren't comfortable with what you discover, find a better provider.",How to Select a Safe Child Care Provider2," Pull up an online map and type in the address of the child care provider, regardless of their licensing or lack thereof. Go to a website that provides sex offender registration data for the area of the provider and (if possible) use their feature to show registered offenders on a map. Obviously, if there are registered sex offenders at or near the location, you'll need to find another provider for your child.


Provision for finding such offenders varies depending on your jurisdiction.

, Examine each of these persons carefully for charges of child/spouse abuse, public intoxication, DUI, fraud, and assaults. Some home care providers just happen to be related to sex offenders or violent offenders and cannot become licensed because those offenders reside in their home.


To discover the names of those who live with the home care provider, simply go to the White Pages (online), and type in the phone number (and/or address) of the provider. Those associated with them and the residence will be listed by name in the search results.

,


Discover websites, reviews, and interactions your child's prospective care giver has had (or is having) with others.
Look up their personal social networking pages.
Look each up as if you plan to establish a trusted relationship with them.

, For instance, a Facebook page filled with dubious ""selfies"" (self-portraits taken with cell phone) and/or pictures of parties involving nudity and/or alcohol may indicate a lack of maturity that should alarm you enough to place your children with a more competent care provider.

Interview the provider(s) with a list of questions in hand.,
Look for transportation vehicles.",How to Select a Safe Child Care Provider3," Ask the prospective care provider:


Do you have children? If so, how many and what are their ages?
Are you married? (This is particularly important if a home-based provider.) For how long? Does your spouse help out with the children? (This is important even in a commercial care provider business.)
Have you or your spouse, or children, ever been arrested for any reason, ever? Has anyone living in your home ever spent time in prison?
How many children do you care for? How many are related to you?
Do you allow other children's parents to help care for the children you watch? What are their names?

, Whether a private residential care provider or a commercial business, and whether or not the provider ever intends to transport your child anywhere, the vehicles you see on the premises should be in excellent condition, with no spare parts lying around. Should a situation cause an evacuation of the provider's location, you'll want to know that vehicles which may be used to transport your child are in working order and equipped with the necessary equipment before you sign your child up.


Examine the exterior and interior of the vehicles you see as if you planned to purchase the vehicle.
Look for signs of dangerous wear on the tires, broken or missing mirrors, broken or missing seats or seatbelts, and oil leaks on the ground under vehicles.
While you're looking, check for children's toys under or around the vehicles. (Children are attracted to toys and are likely to go under and around cars in order to grab up a discarded toy. You want a provider who keeps all debris away from vehicles at all times.)
Ask the carer what he or she does to ensure that no child is in the driveway when vehicles are in use.

"
"
If everything about the provider looks good and safe to you, take your child for a visit.",How to Select a Safe Child Care Provider4," Walk them around, both inside and out, and (if possible) observe their reaction to what they see and who they see.


If the child becomes nervous or alarmed (begins to cry and shows signs of distress), take them away immediately and see if the behavior normalizes. Often, children who cannot yet speak will react to a place that makes them fearful. You won't have to decide whether or not your child is just distressed over the idea of being separated from you because in this case it is your reaction that will carry the weight of the decision. You know your child, and your protectiveness of that child is instinctive; don't override your gut when you see their reaction and feel your own.

Understand that some comments mean no harm.,
Explain your child's visual disability clearly.,
Know that you don't have to answer back to hurtful comments.,
Keep a sense of humor.,
Be assertive but gentle when answering back to people.,
Walk away and leave.,
Have a plan on what to say ahead of time.,
Talk about the mean comments to your child.,
Talk to other families with blind and visually impaired children.,
Meet the Blind and Visually Impaired community.,
Keep your child's self-esteem high.,
Don't worry about what others think and love your child.",How to Deal with Hurtful Comments About Your Child's Visual Disability," Some comments may seem pretty insensitive or hurtful, but some are said because the person doesn't know have enough knowledge about people with visual impairments. It's important to understand that some comments are not trying to attack you and your child, and most of the time, they're not trying to be mean, it could be the person not knowing enough about other disabilities. You may want to use this opportunity to educate them about your child's visual disability so they can understand your child better and avoid being hurtful. It's important to note, however, that harassment is not someone who doesn't know about a visual disability, but rather, someone who is just plain ignorant. There is a difference between not understanding the way someone is and being unaccepted or insensitive towards others.
Understand your audience. Sometimes other parents or adults will question or make comments about your child since they find your child 'unusual', while other kids or teenagers near the same age as your child may just be curious and want to know more about the way your child behaves. ;
, Putting a smile on your face, take a couple minutes to explain the way your child is and clarifying clearly about their visual disability. You don't need to tell them all about your child's condition or all about your child's troubles, just mention the behavior that the person is commenting about. State the facts simply and positively. Some examples:


""Ruth presses her fingers on her eyes because she is is visually impaired and finds it a relaxing coping method when she's upset.""
""Daniel's eyes wiggle because he has a visual impairment and can't see clearly.""
""Edna has this white cane because she's blind and can't see obstacles in her way. The cane helps guide her and keeps her safe.""

, You are not penalized for not responding to someone's comments and you won't get in trouble for ignoring someone's rudeness. If someone makes a comment about your child that you feel won't benefit you or them, calmly say that you appreciate their concern but you have to go now. Then hurriedly leave or do another task and carry on. Learn to be thick-skinned about these type of people and ignore any ignorance. , If the person is clearly not going to accept your child or you don't have the time to deal with hurtful people, you could throw in a bit of humor and play dumb. If the person asks what's wrong with your child's eyes you can say, ""Really! You think there's a problem with my child's eyes?"" and then laugh it off. Most of the time, the person will simply find you not a good enough person to communicate to, so they'll most likely end the conversation and leave. , A lot of people may tell you that you should 'discipline' your child correctly if your child gets upset, that they're sorry your child is such a 'burden', and that your child is socially unacceptable from the way they act. Learn to answer back to these comments with kindness, but at the same time, being assertive and keeping your ground. Some examples:


If someone goes up to you and asks, ""What's wrong with your child?"" you can simply state, ""Nothing is wrong with him, he just has a visual impairment and his eyes tend to wiggle around sometimes.""
If a parent starts to make harsh critics about your child you can say, ""My child has a visual disability, but has feelings, too.""
If someone tells you that you shouldn't bring your child out in public because of the way they are, you can kindly state ""My child shouldn't have to stay home all day just because of her impairment, and needs to learn about the world around them.""
If someone states to you that your child is weird, you can say, ""I understand and respect your opinion, but I believe my son is very unique and special, even though Benjamin doesn't seem to look like any ordinary kid.""

, If all else fails, and the person doesn't seem to accept your child, it's best to drop it and end it there. You don't want to cause a scene and arguing won't solve anything. Some people are just plain rude and insensitive, so it's not worth the time or effort to try to get them to accept your child. If they're not willing to accept them, leave and move on. These types of people should be avoided to not make an impact on you or your child's self-esteem. , Preparing yourself ahead of time for hurtful comments will make you feel more prepared when it does happen. You may want to write down a small paragraph or a set of questions and answers to practice with. That way, when people do comment your child, you'll be ready to respond back. , Your child, especially older children, may feel hurt by some of these comments. They might feel ashamed, angry, confused, upset, or sad and may feel hated and unloved. Set some time aside to talk about the experience, explaining that their comments aren't nice at all. Remind your child that they are okay and that people like them are not. , Communicating and connecting with other parents of blind and visually impaired children can boost your self-esteem and let you know that you're not alone. Most parents of children with visual impairments have dealt with hurtful comments about their child themselves, and may offer some tips on how to deal with it.


Try introducing and letting your child and meet other children with a visual disability as well so they can understand they're not alone with their visual impairment.

, Blind and visually impaired individuals have faced a numerous amount of hurtful comments themselves and are willing to share their word and advice on how to cope with it. They'll be willing to support and comfort you about it, as well as keep you on your toes and learn to ignore these type of comments. , Your child will most likely feel really hurt from other people's rude comments, so it's important to keep your child's self-esteem high. Praise their achievements and the things they can do well, and constantly remind them that you love them and care for them a lot.

, Your child is not broken, a burden, or weird. They seem abnormal from other sighted children, but they're unique and different, and pose different challenges than most sighted children. Don't worry about society's opinions, but instead, raise your child with the best of your abilities and cherish the happy moments with them. By accepting and loving them for who they are, you'll make life a whole lot easier for both you and your child.

Listen to teens and adults who experienced ODD.,
Join a parent support group.,
Supplement treatment with medication if necessary.",How to Deal with Oppositional Defiant Disorder," Children with ODD tend to exhibit certain behaviors that identify ODD, usually beginning in preschool and almost always presenting before the early teen years.While all children experience behavior difficulties, a child with ODD will display a ""frequent and persistent pattern""of hostile and disobedient behavior. If you identify four or more of the following behaviors in your child that cause problems at home, school, and other environments, which have lasted six months or more, take your child to a therapist to see if he fits a formal diagnosis:Loses temper often
Argues frequently with adults
Refuses to comply with requests from adults
Deliberately annoys people, is easily annoyed by others
Blames others for his mistakes or misbehavior
Is angry or resentful
Is spiteful or vindictive;
, Children with ODD often experience themselves as victims, and believe that their actions of punching a wall or hurting another child are justified.Remind the child that she is allowed to feel angry, resentful, and upset. She may even be a victim in a situation. However, often the reaction is more severe than the original offense.

, While your child may be rightfully upset, he is in charge of his behaviors and reactions. Nobody made him react in a harmful or negative way; he chose it. Acknowledge that bad things happen, but that it’s his decision how to respond to things, even when something unfair happens.Ask your child, “If someone is mad at you, is it okay if she hits you? What about if you’re mad at someone? Can you hit him? What’s the difference?”

, Children with ODD often will go to extreme lengths to feel in control. You may start by discussing your child hitting his sibling, and end up in a power struggle about something unrelated. Instead of engaging the struggle, disengage from the situation.You can steer the conversation back to the original point, or you may choose to walk away.


Recognize when your child is arguing to defend himself or whether it is coming from a place of wanting power.

, Your child doesn't just need to know how not to respond, but how to respond well. You can discuss or even role-play situations to help them learn constructive responses. Talk about...


Taking deep breaths or counting to calm down

Setting boundaries, such as ""I need some alone time"" and ""Please don't touch me.""
Using ""I"" language
What to do when someone else doesn't respect their boundaries or feelings
Getting help when they are upset or confused

, When trying to communicate with your child — whether it be a request, a reprimand, or praise — there are ways to communicate that are helpful and productive, and ways that will impede communication and possibly trigger bad behavior.


Try to communicate calmly, clearly, and using short, to-the-point explanations. State what you want and expect using direct language.
Make eye contact and maintain relaxed or neutral facial expressions, gestures, and posture.
Ask your child questions and listen to his answers. Discuss what is happening in the present, not things he did in the past, and try to be solution-oriented.
Do not lecture your child, yell, name call, bring up old problems, make assumptions about your child or his behavior, or use negative body language.

, While it’s difficult to remove your own emotions from a situation, do your best to respond to your child without anger. State what has happened, why it’s not okay, and what needs to change. Follow through with any consequences relating to the behavior. Then, remove yourself from the situation and don’t engage in any conflict.If you find yourself becoming angry, take some deep breaths to help center yourself, or repeat a phrase that helps you such as “I am calm and relaxed”.Take some time before responding in order to avoid saying anything you may regret.

, Don’t blame your child (“My child is ruining my life. I have no time for myself because I’m always disciplining her”) and don’t blame yourself (“If only I was a better parent, my child wouldn’t act like this.”) If you find yourself caught up in these thoughts, take a step back and acknowledge how you are feeling. Remember that your child is not responsible for your emotional well-being; only you are responsible for how you feel.Take responsibility for your own feelings and actions, and show yourself to be a role model for your child.

, Inconsistent parenting can be confusing for a child. If a child sees an opportunity to get something that they desire, they will most likely take it. They may try to wear down your defenses in order for you to give in and say yes. When in conflict, be consistent in how you respond. Be clear in your expectations and strong in your willpower to enforce the guidelines.Create a positive behaviors and consequences chart, which lets your child know what will happen with certain behaviors. Being clear and consistent is helpful for knowing what to expect for both you and your child. Reward good behavior and respond to bad behavior with appropriate consequences.
If your child tries to wear you down, be clear. Say ""No means no"" or ""Do I look like the kind of dad who will change his mind if you keep asking?"" Try a simple, business-like response, such as, ""This is not up for discussion,"" or, ""I'm not arguing over this. This discussion is over.""

, If you come into a discussion assuming your child is trying to annoy you or cause a problem, this will color how you respond. It’s natural to push back when someone pushes against you, even when it’s your child. Don’t expect your child to correct these behaviors on his own, he needs guidance. When you start to have negative thoughts about your child, replace them with more positive ones.If you find yourself thinking, “My son is always trying to start a fight and never knows when to let go”, replace that thought with, “Every child has strengths and difficulties. I know with my consistent effort, I will help my child build the skills he needs to express himself productively.”

, Consider what sort of home life your child has. Is there constant fighting or is a family member struggling with substance abuse problems? Do you spend very little time with your child, or does she watch excessive amounts of TV or play video games for hours? Identify both obvious and more subtle ways the home environment may be negatively affecting your child, then work to change those things.


Consider limiting TV or gaming time, having mandatory family dinners, and seeking counseling if you and your partner are constantly fighting. If there is substance abuse or a mental health disorder in the family, help that person begin treatment.
Other potential environmental or family stressors include economic stress, parental mental illness, severe or harsh punishment, multiple moves, and divorce.

, Your child may experience anger or frustration but not know how to express these emotions in a positive or constructive way. If you notice your child is angry, label the emotion for them. Say, “It seems like you’re angry.” Identify feelings in others and in yourself. Say, “Sometimes I feel sad, and when I feel sad, I don’t want to talk to people and I keep my head down.”Talk about how feelings can be expressed. For instance, say, “How can you tell when someone is upset? When do you notice when someone is happy? What does it look like when someone is mad?” Talk about ways that your child experiences and expresses emotions.

, Make it clear that both your child and other people have the right to set boundaries, and to have others respect those boundaries. Learning the basics of consent can help your child recognize why hitting, poking, or kicking others is not okay.


Enforce others' boundaries as needed. For example, ""Your sister said she doesn't want a hug, just a high five. It's important to respect that.""
Enforce your child's boundaries as well. For example, if another child plays with your daughter's hair, even after your daughter has asked them to stop, give the other child a stern look and say that this is not okay.

, Children with ODD can improve — studies have shown up to 67% of children diagnosed with ODD will be symptom-free within three years if they receive treatment.The sooner you address and begin to treat ODD and any co-existing conditions, the better your child's chances are of improving.


Unfortunately, about 30% of children diagnosed go on to develop Conduct Disorder (CD).This is considered a more serious disorder that can lead to antisocial behavior (such as cruelty toward people or animals, initiating physical fights, arson, and/or forcing someone into sexual activity)., If you’re having problems getting along with your child, chances are your child is struggling, too. While outwardly your child may be misbehaving, inwardly they may not know how to express their wants and desires in a way that is easily received. A therapist can help your child express himself in a more conducive way. They can help your child understand emotions, express emotions in a constructive way, and work through anger.


Behavior therapy serves to help children unlearn negative behaviors, and replace them with more positive behaviors. Therapy often involves parents to help enforce the new learned behaviors at home.Therapy may help your child learn problem solving skills, empathy, social skills, and help reduce aggressive behaviors.
See if there is a social-skills program at the child's school or somewhere nearby. This program helps teach children to interact with their peers in a more positive way as well as help them improve school work., Often, children with ODD will also have another emotional problem or disability, such as anxiety, depression, or ADHD.If you suspect your child may have one of these disorders, make an appointment with a therapist in order to discuss a possible diagnosis. A child will not make progress with his ODD unless the co-existing disorder is treated as well., You may find it helpful to adjust your approach to parenting altogether. A parenting class can be beneficial in creating structure to your approach to parenting.


You may learn different ways to approach your child’s behavior, systems for managing behavior, and find support with other parents who are struggling with their kids.Family therapy can help the entire family learn how to interact positively with the person with ODD, and can give other family members a voice. It can also help educate family members about ODD.

, Learn about what their parents did that helped them the most, and what they would like you to know as a parent. Because they have been in your child's position, they can offer great insight on how to handle things well.

, A support group can offer help in a way that other resources cannot. Meeting with other parents who encounter similar struggles can be a relief as well as a way to share struggles and inspirations. You can begin friendships with other parents who encounter similar difficulties, and offer support to one another.Check out online resources as well, such as Incredible Years, Center for Collaborative Problem Solving, and Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)., Medication alone is not a suitable treatment for ODD, but it can help treat co-occurring mental health conditions or reduce some of the more severe symptoms of ODD.Make an appointment with a psychiatrist and discuss whether or not medication is the right choice for your child.


Before pursuing medication, consider the following: whether the child has had a physical and psychiatric evaluation, if all other treatments have been attempted, possible side effects (weight gain, affecting growth, etc.), how medication will be given at home and at school, how to talk to the child about the medication and side effects, how to monitor for side effects.

Consider auditory processing disorder (APD).,
Look at the possibility of visual processing disorder.,
Recognize the possibility that other disabilities are at play.",How to Diagnose a Learning Disability," If you think you or your child may have a learning disorder, consider what they are doing to make you think that. Take note of what you see and hear from your child that you believe may be a symptom of a learning disability.Write down any behaviors or challenges your child faces that you believe may be unusual. This will be useful when you talk to a professional. Look for particularly disruptive or uncharacteristically aggressive tendencies, as well as extreme shyness or reservation.
If your child is in school, ask their teachers if your child has reported any particular problems to them. Also take note if a teacher says your child is excessively active or disruptive.;
, Different learning disabilities will have different symptoms. However, some struggles and symptoms are commonly seen across many learning disabilities. Observe and talk with your child to see if they experience symptoms such as:A short attention span.
Poor memory retention.
Poor reading comprehension or writing abilities.
Struggles following directions.
Difficulty differentiating between or among letters, numbers, and sounds.
Poor eye-hand coordination.
Noticeably differing performance from day to day.

, In toddlers and young children, you may be able to detect a learning disability early on by looking for delays in developmental milestones. Early detection can help ensure your child gets the assistance and support they need as they first start school.


Late walking or speech may be early indicators or a learning disability. Babies generally take their first steps around one year. First words often occur around the nine month mark.Struggles socializing may also potentially indicate your child has a learning disability. If they seem unable to understand body language and nonverbal cues, or if they cannot grasp social concepts such as eye contact, you may want to have them screened., There are a number of indicators that may help you identify if you or your loved one is more likely to have a learning disability. Indicators do not definitively diagnose a learning disability, but they can help parents and doctors determine if early screening or evaluation is necessary. Consider:Low birth weight or an early birth.
Difficulty suckling, sucking, and swallowing in infancy.
Frequent middle ear inflammation that may cause occasional hearing loss.
A family history of learning disabilities or language comprehension struggles.
Exposure to environmental toxins, such as lead.
Limited language exposure in the home.
Limited impulse control.
Constant repetition of ideas or thoughts.

, Untrained professionals should avoid making diagnostic decrees without the input of a trained professional. If you believe your child has a learning disability or a condition that can make learning more difficult, schedule an evaluation with a team at your child’s school, or recommended by your doctor.


The evaluation may include input from special education teachers, an assessment by the school psychologist, and work with specialists in areas such as speech pathology and motor function.Your doctor may be able to screen your newborn or infant for early signs of a learning disability with tests that check for vision, hearing, and responsiveness., Screenings performed by schools and professionals not specifically licensed to diagnose a learning disability likely won’t come with a diagnosis. Instead, they will include observations and recommendations for treatment.Seek the help of psychologist, psychiatrist, or clinical social worker who is licensed to diagnose a learning disability. Ask them, “Are you licensed to diagnose my child’s learning disability?”
Work with them to gather supplementary information they may want to review from your home or your child’s school. This may include report cards, work samples, teacher comments, and more.
Ask for a written report of the professional’s diagnosis after their evaluation is complete.
Ask the professional, “How can I coordinate with my child’s school to help them get the attention and treatment they need in class?”

, Working with a psychiatrist outside of school can help anyone with a learning disability learn both skills to manage their disability as well as skills to deal with the emotions that often come with it. Find a psychiatrist or other therapist in your area that specializes in learning disabilities.


Schedule an initial appointment to meet with the specialist and simply discuss your interest and concerns. Let them know, ""I want help managing a learning disability. What methods and practices do you use to help people with these kinds of problems?""
Ask your psychiatrist and/or therapist what measures of progress they would like to see. They may want something from the school, or they may want an evaluation directly from the child or parent. Ask them openly about what communications work best for them.

, The type of education and treatment your child needs will depend upon their diagnosis. Once you have a written report with your child’s diagnosis and professional recommendations for treatment options, work at home and with your child’s school to get them the care they need.You will work with your child’s school to create an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). The IEP will state your child’s learning needs, what services the school will provide to address them, and how their progress will be measured.
Those who evaluated your child, your child’s teachers, the school administrators, and you as a parent will all be active in creating and implementing your child’s learning plan.
Ask about what techniques a special education teacher will use with your child and how they will help benefit your child’s education.
Also inquire about what instructional methods will be used to help integrate your child into inclusive general education classes.Check in regularly with your child’s teachers and ask them, “Is there anything we can do at home to help my child’s treatment and development?”

, In this case the child has difficulty in understanding the relationship between sounds, letters and words. On the other hand, while reading they cannot understand the meaning of words, phrases and paragraphs. Symptoms include:Difficulty associating letters with sounds.
Trouble ""sounding out"" unfamiliar words.
Difficulty writing or copying words or letters in order.
Pronunciation confusion, such as ""coft sat"" instead of ""soft cat.""
Difficulty with reading level, reading aloud, and reading comprehension.

, Dyscalculia impacts one’s ability to understand number and/or learn mathematical concepts. Some kids have a tough time telling the time from the clock. They may also struggle in memorizing the tables and adding (6+6= 12 or 6x6=36). Other symptoms may include:Difficulty counting by twos, fives, tens, et cetera.
Difficulty distinguishing between or ordering numbers

, Affected people cannot maintain neatness while writing. They may also be unable to copy accurately from a different source or to put their thoughts into writing, and have difficulty in spelling correctly. Common warning signs include:Illegible handwriting.
Inconsistent spacing on the page.
Poor spatial planning on paper.

, Auditory processing disorder, also referred to as receptive language problems, involves difficulty processing and distinguishing between sounds. This makes it difficult to understand spoken language. This confusion can lead to difficulty in reading, writing, and spelling.Children with APD may also have a difficult time recognizing where sounds come from or ordering sounds mentally.

, A person with this disorder has eyes that work fine; however, this information can get jumbled inside the brain. Symptom may include:Difficulty reading; skipping words and lines, or reversing letters.
Hand-eye coordination issues.
Depth perception trouble; may appear clumsy.

, Autism, ADHD, anxiety, and depression may also be contributing to your or your child's struggles and differences.When setting up an evaluation for your child, let the evaluators know if your child has been screened for or diagnosed with mental health or social disorders.
Ask evaluators if they believe your child has a non-learning disorder-based challenge, and see if they may be able to provide you with referrals for further evaluation.

Determine if your child has symptoms of inattentive ADHD presentation.,
Determine if your child has symptoms of hyperactive-impulsive ADHD presentation.,
Determine if your child has combination presentation ADHD.,
Get a diagnosis from a mental health professional.,
Ask your child’s mental health professional about other disorders.",How to Deal With ADHD Kids1," There are three types of presentations of ADHD. In order to qualify for a diagnosis, children aged 16 and under must exhibit at least six symptoms in more than one setting, for at least six months. Symptoms must be inappropriate for the person’s developmental level and be seen as interrupting normal functioning in social or school settings. Symptoms for ADHD (inattentive presentation) include: Makes careless mistakes, is inattentive to detail
Has trouble paying attention (tasks, playing)
Doesn’t seem to be paying attention when someone is talking to her or him
Doesn’t follow through (homework, chores, jobs); easily sidetracked
Is organizationally challenged
Avoids tasks requiring sustained focus (like schoolwork)
Can’t keep track of or often loses keys, glasses, papers, tools, etc.
Is easily distracted
Is forgetful;
, Some symptoms must be at the level of “disruptive” for them to count in a diagnosis. Track if your child has at least six symptoms in more than one setting, for at least six months: Fidgety, squirmy; taps hands or feet
Feels restless, running or climbing inappropriately
Struggles to play quietly/do quiet activities
“On the go” as if “driven by a motor”
Excessive talking
Blurts out even before questions are asked
Struggles to wait for their turn
Interrupts others, inserts self into others’ discussions/games

, The third presentation of ADHD is when the subject meets criteria to qualify for both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive criteria of ADHD. If your child has six symptoms from either category, he or she may have a combined presentation of ADHD. If you are unsure of your child's behavior, ask other adults and friends of your child. For example, your child's friends, friends' parents, teacher, or sports coach. Educators and childcare professionals might have more context for your child's behavior because they have worked with so many children.

, As you determine your child’s level of ADHD, seek the guidance of a mental health professional to make an official diagnosis. This person will also be able to determine whether your child’s symptoms can be better explained by or attributable to another psychiatric disorder.

, Talk with your doctor or mental health professional about other disorders or conditions that might have symptoms that are similar to ADHD. As if having an ADHD diagnosis isn’t challenging enough, one out of every five with ADHD is diagnosed with another serious disorder (depression and bipolar disorder are common partners).


One-third of children with ADHD also have a behavioral disorder (conduct disorder, oppositional defiance disorder). ADHD tends to pair up with learning disabilities and anxiety, too."
"
Make structure and routine your default.,
Break up tasks into small pieces.,
Maintain structure during school breaks.,
Help your child learn time management.,
Establish storage bin systems.",How to Deal With ADHD Kids2," The key to success lies in establishing consistent schedules and routines combined with organization and structure. Not only will this alleviate the stress on the child with ADHD, it should decrease misbehaviors that are spurred on by that stress. The less stress, the more success; the more success—and resultant praise —the better the self-esteem, which sets a child up for additional success in the future. Have a whiteboard with the schedule for the day written down. Display it in the kitchen, living room, or somewhere else obvious.
Displaying schedules and responsibilities in the house remind your kids what they have to do, and decrease their ability to say “I forgot.”

, Children with ADHD need tasks to be broken into steps—chunking—that are given either one at a time or in written form. Parents should give positive feedback as the child completes each step. , Winter, spring, and summer breaks can be difficult times for parents of children with ADHD: the structure and schedule of the past school year suddenly ends. With less structure, children with ADHD can experience higher levels of stress and exhibit more symptoms. Keep to schedules and routines as much as possible to lower everyone’s stress.


Try imagine walking a high wire without a net for nine months and then all of a sudden, the wire snaps and you are plummeting toward the ground. That’s summer break for a child with ADHD: falling without a net in place. Try to remember where your child is coming from to empathize with their experience.
You can try to grandfather in changes in the schedule. For example, if your child woke up at 7am during the school year, the first week of summer break wake up at 7:30am; the second week, 8am. The long-term scheduled change can ease your child into different schedules.

, A child with ADHD doesn’t have a great concept of time.People with ADHD struggle with clock issues, both with gauging the amount of time it will take to accomplish a task and estimating how much time has passed. Give your child ways to report back to you or complete a task in the right amount of time. For example:


Buy a kitchen timer to take outside when you want him or her to come in after 15 minutes—or play a CD and tell her she needs to complete her chores by the time it ends.
You can teach a child to brush teeth the right length of time by humming the ABCs or the Happy Birthday song.
Play beat the clock by trying to finish a chore before a particular song ends.
Sweep the floor to the rhythm of a song., Children with ADHD are constantly trying to make sense of their environment. Parents can help by organizing the home, especially the child’s bedroom and play area. Establish a storage system that separates items into categories and reduces the crowding that leads to overload.


Consider color-coded storage cubes and wall hooks as well as open shelves.
Use picture or word labels to remind them what goes where.Label storage tubs with corresponding pictures. Have separate storage tubs for different toys (dolls in the yellow bucket with a picture of Barbie taped on it, My Little Pony toys in the green bucket with the horse picture attached, etc.). Separate clothing so that socks have their own drawer and there’s a picture of a sock on it, and so on. Keep a box or a storage bin in a central location of the home where you can pile your child’s toys, gloves, papers, Legos, and other miscellany that tend to spread all over the place. It will be easier for the child with ADHD to empty that bucket than to be told to pick up all her things from the living room. You also might establish a rule that the third time you find Darth Vader in the living room unattended, he gets confiscated for a week—or that if the bucket gets full, a lid will be put on it and it’ll vanish for a while with all those special treasures inside.

Coordinate with your child’s teachers.,
Use a daily planner for your child.,
Reward your child with praise.,
Establish a consistent homework routine.,
Review homework assignments together.,
Help your child keep track of school belongings.,
Encourage peer interactions for your child.,
Role play to prepare your child for unfamiliar events.,
Look into your school’s special services.,
Get an individualized education plan (IEP) for your child.,
Act in your child’s best interests.",How to Deal With ADHD Kids3," Meet with your child’s teacher to discuss a variety of topics with the teacher. These include effective rewards and consequences, effective homework routines, how you and the teacher will communicate on a regular basis about problems and successes, how you can mirror what the teacher is doing in the classroom for greater consistency, and so on. For some students, success will be obtained relatively easily by establishing consistent schedules, routines, and homework communication methods as well as utilizing effective organizational tools such as planners, color-coded binders, and checklists.
Being on the same page with your teacher can remove the ""teacher said differently"" excuse.

, Organization and consistent routines will save the day when it comes to homework, and it’s a good idea to coordinate with teachers whenever possible. Does the teacher provide a daily homework list or does the school promote the use of planners? If not, buy a planner that has plenty of space to write daily notes and show your child how to use it.


If the teacher(s) can’t or won’t commit to initialing the planner every day, ask the teacher to help find a responsible student—a homework buddy —to check the planner before dismissal each afternoon.
If your child is struggling to remember assignments, check your child’s homework box in the planner every day as the first thing when you get home. If your kid remembered to write down the homework assignment, give your kid praise.

, Praise is the best and easiest way to encourage learning and good behavior from your child. Giving your child positive feedback about something they did that makes you proud can also benefit your long term personal relationship.Every day the planner comes home, make sure to give your child praise. Then make sure the planner back into the backpack every morning before school. Arrange for the homework buddy to give morning reminders to turn in the homework, too.
Reward your child for trying and struggling to do the right thing, even when he or she fails. This teaches your child that work ethic, despite failing, is a good skill to have.

, Homework should be completed at the same time and same place every day. Have plenty of supplies on hand, organized in bins if you have the space.


Be sure homework doesn’t start the second your child walks in the door. Let him or her get rid of excess energy riding a bike or climbing trees for 20 minutes, or let her/him chatter and get that excess talking out of his system before telling him/her to do seatwork.
Try to avoid allowing your kid to stall or put off work. Some kids use diversion techniques like asking for snacks, going to the bathroom, or complaining of tiredness and needing a nap. While these are all completely valid and normal things for a kid to ask for, try to notice when your kid is really trying to avoid work.

, Show how you would organize the work and recommend ways to prioritize the assignments. Chunk big projects and set deadlines for individual stages to be completed.Provide a brain-food snack such as peanuts as you review the assignments.
It is particularly important that you communicate with the teacher about what a good homework assignment looks like, and what doing the homework well looks like. You don't want to teach your child something that contradicts the teacher's methods or rules, even if just for consistency and structure.

, Many children with ADHD have trouble keeping track of their belongings and struggle deciding or remembering which books to bring home each night—let alone remembering to take them back to school the next day.


Some teachers will allow students to have a “home set” of textbooks. This might be a recommendation for inclusion on an IEP as well.
Consider having a list of items your child should leave home with near the door. Check this list every day before your child leaves for school.
It is tempting for you to control and remember everything, even if your child is supposed to be responsible for it. However, your child not only needs his or her textbooks to do homework, but also needs to remember his or her textbooks to learn responsibility and how to follow a schedule.
If applicable, try using online books or sources and post the passwords somewhere in the house. Some find using the computer for homework and reading more comfortable.

, One of the big challenges people with ADHD face as adults is that they didn’t learn to socialize appropriately as a child.Pick an activity your child likes and that can fit into your routine.


Encourage your child to participate in peer interactions like scouting activities, sports teams, and dance.
Find an organization which will allow you and your child to volunteer together, such as a local food pantry.
Host parties and encourage attendance at parties that will help your child to live as normal a life as possible. If your child is invited to a birthday party, have a frank discussion with the hosting parents and explain that you need to attend to act as an anchor—and disciplinarian, as necessary. They will appreciate your candor and your child will benefit from the experience.

, You might be able to decrease your child's potential for anxiety by role playing out the anxiety-producing situation. In addition to providing familiarity and a comfort level for the upcoming event, role playing allows you to see how your child might react then guide him or her in appropriate responses. This is especially helpful in preparing to meet new people, work out conflicts with friends, or going to a new school.


If your child does not want to role play with you, ask a therapist or other trusted adult.
When role-playing, explicitly identify skills and techniques for navigating the situation. Write them down and discuss why they are useful.

, In the United States, children qualify for free special education services based on one of two basic reasons: they have a qualifying disability or they have fallen far behind their peers academically. Once parents become aware that their child is not succeeding in school and they feel additional help is required (an opinion usually made in conjunction with the classroom teacher), parents may request a special education evaluation. If you live outside the United States, contact your local school board to ask about special services.


This request should be made in writing. Assistance can take various forms from minor accommodations (such as extra time for taking tests) to self-contained classrooms with teachers and aides who are specially trained to deal with children who exhibit behavioral disruptions. Once qualified, a child with ADHD may have access to other school-based services, as well, such as riding home in a smaller bus with extra staff who supervise students more closely than a lone driver is able to do.
Beware the school that tells you ADHD is not a qualifying disability! It is true that ADHD is not listed as one of the 13 disability categories in the language of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), but category 9 is “other health impairment,” which is later defined as “… chronic or acute health problems such as asthma, attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder… which adversely affect a child’s educational performance.” , An IEP is a formalized document created by school staff and parents that spells out the academic, behavioral, and social goals of special-ed students. It includes how results will be determined, as well as specific interventions that will be used to achieve the goals. The IEP lists decisions made concerning self-contained classrooms, percentage of time in mainstream classrooms, accommodations, discipline, testing, and more.


In the United States, you must provide documentation of your child’s ADHD diagnosis in order to get an IEP. Complete a special education evaluation that shows the child’s disability is interfering with his or her education. Then, the school will ask you to participate in an IEP conference. If you live outside the United States, contact your local school board to ask about special services. The school is required to invite parents to regular IEP conferences to evaluate the progress of the child and the effectiveness of the plan. Then adjustments can be made as needed. The school is legally bound to follow the guidelines laid down in the IEP. Teachers who fail to follow the IEP can be held liable.
Be sure that the IEP is specific to your child and that your input is included in the form. Do not sign a completed IEP until you have reviewed it and added your input. Once a child has an initial IEP, it becomes easier to establish special education services when changing schools or transferring to a new school district.

, Unfortunately, even with outstanding cooperation and effort by the adults, many children still will not succeed. They may require more intensive services available through the school or district special education department. In some cases, rigid teaching methods by inflexible teachers are the issue and parents must seek administrative support or look into changing teachers, changing schools, or exploring special education options. Choose the best paths for your circumstance to ensure maximum success for your child.

Avoid chore wars with routines and consistency.,
Give instructions one step at a time.,
Post visual cues as reminders.,
Make chores more fun for your child.",How to Deal With ADHD Kids4," Decrease the arguments and petulance of assigning chores by setting and enforcing a consistent time they occur. Tie them to a regular reward whenever possible. For example:


Instead of serving dessert at the end of dinner, serve it after the table is cleared and dishwasher loaded.
Afternoon snacks will hit the table after the trash is taken out.
Beds must be made before going outside to play.
The family pet must be fed before humans have breakfast.

, Establish routines around chores that reflect consistent instructions that are given one step at a time. Then have your child repeat the instruction then getting praise at each step.For example:


Loading the dishwasher: First load all the plates on the bottom. (“Great job!”). Now load all glasses on the top. (“Excellent!”). Next is silverware …
Laundry: First find all the pants and put them into a stack here. (“Awesome!”) Now put shirts in a stack there. (“Super-duper!”). Socks … then have the child fold each stack, then put the stacks in his or her room, one stack at a time.

, Use calendars, written schedules and chore boards to remind your child of chores that need to be done. These tools remove the “I forgot” excuse., Whenever possible, find ways to make chores more fun and help remove the stress of the task. You need to teach your child compliance, teamwork, and the need to pull his weight—but there’s no reason it can’t be fun at the same time.Belt out instructions in a variety of silly voices or have puppets give orders.
Walk backward when checking progress and make back-up “beeps.”
Have your child dress like Cinderella on a chore morning and play music from the movie that she can sing to as she works.Keep an eye on your child’s attitude. If you sense he or she is getting frazzled, make the next chore super silly or assign movement to it. Say to your child, “Pretend you are a shark as you put this book on my desk.” Or, simply call for a cookie break. "

Be consistent with discipline.,
Enforce the discipline immediately.,
Ensure your consequence is powerful.,
Control your own emotions.,
Be firm and stick to your rules.,
Avoid rewarding bad behavior with attention.,
Refuse to argue or vacillate.,
Follow through with consequences.,
Speak only when your child's attention is on you.,
Remember your child is unique.,
Use timeouts effectively.,
Anticipate problems.",How to Deal With ADHD Kids5," All children need discipline and to learn that bad behavior comes with consequences. For discipline to be effective at changing behavior, it must be consistent. A lack of consistency can lead to a child developing confusion or willfulness.


Your child should know the rules and the consequences for breaking the rules.
The consequence should happen the same every time the rule is broken.
In addition, the consequence should apply whether the misbehavior happens at home or in public.
It’s crucial that all caretakers are on board, disciplining the same way. When one person is a weak link amongst the adults in the child’s sphere, that weakness will be exploited every time. He or she will “shop for a better answer” or play the “divide and conquer” game. Be sure that the babysitter, daycare or after-school provider, grandparents, and other adults who have charge of your child are on board with your desire for consequences that are consistent, immediate, and powerful.

, The consequence for a problem behavior has an immediate impact. It is not delayed. Persons with ADHD often struggle with time concepts,so postponing a consequence has no meaning. It invites an explosion if the child gets a forgotten consequence for a previous infraction that might as well have happened a year ago., If the consequence for speeding was paying a fine of a buck for every mile per hour over the speed limit, we’d all speed constantly. This is not a powerful enough consequence to change our behavior.


We tend to monitor our speed to avoid a $200 ticket plus higher insurance premiums. The same applies to children with ADHD. The consequence needs to be powerful enough to act as a deterrent.Be powerful, but fair. Sometimes, you can ask your child what he or she thinks is fair to get a gauge on what a powerful consequence might be.

, Much easier to say than do, you must not respond to misbehavior emotionally. Your anger or raised voice may cause anxiety or send a message that your child can control you by getting you angry. Remaining calm and loving will convey the message you want. Before taking action, do a self-check to make sure you are responding in the way you want to respond.If you need time to calm down but also need an immediate consequence, you can tell your child, “I am so upset with you, that I cannot talk about the consequence of your action right now. We will discuss it tomorrow, but believe that you are in trouble as of now.” Say this in a calm and factual tone, not a threatening tone.
Recognize the importance of emotions, while not being emotional. There is a fine line between acknowledging the influence of emotions and feelings on our love for our children, and letting those emotions control the important decisions we make to care for our children.
Create mechanisms for yourself to calm down and handle your own emotions before responding to the situation emotionally.

, Your child may persistently ask you ten times to have a special privilege and you say no nine times. But if you finally cave in at the end, the message sent and received is that being a pest will pay off. If your child is persistent in the moment, you can respond with, ""If you care enough about it, we can have a discussion about changing the rules later this weekend. But right now, we're going to follow the rules that we decided on earlier.""

, Some kids crave attention badly enough to behave badly so they’ll get it. Instead, reward good behavior with an abundance of attention but consequence bad behavior with limited focus lest your attention be interpreted as a reward! , Once you give a specific instruction, it is to be followed without exception, because you are the adult in charge. If you allow your child to argue, he or she sees that as an opportunity to win. Many children are willing to argue until the other party exhausts and caves in. Avoid giving your child that opportunity by setting rules you can call on as objective precedents. If your child is not acknowledging the authority of your rules, maybe change your rules up. In a calmer, different setting, ask your child what he or she thinks would be fair rules. See if you can negotiate any compromises so that your child follows the rules more, and you are both happier with the outcome.

, If you threaten a dire consequence, and the bad behavior occurs, follow through on the promised punishment. If you don’t follow through, your child won’t listen the next time you try to coerce good behavior or prevent bad behavior. This is because you’ll already have a track record in his or her eyes., Make sure your child is making eye contact with you. If you assign a task, make the instructions brief and have him/her repeat it back to you. Wait for the job to be completed before distracting her/him with anything else., Even if your child has other siblings, avoid comparisons with other kids, especially siblings. Children with ADHD have brain-based differences that often require accommodations.Generally, you’ll find that you’ll have to give a child with ADHD multiple reminders, make the task shorter, require a different standard of completion, and more. Even then, kids with ADHD present symptoms and live very differently from one another.Your child is different and will act differently.

, Instead of a timeout being a prison sentence, use this time as an opportunity for the child to self-calm and contemplate the situation. Then, he or she will discuss with you how this situation came about, how to resolve it and how to prevent it from happening again in the future. You’ll also talk about consequences if it should reoccur.


Choose a designated spot in your house where your child will stand or sit quietly. This should be a place where he or she cannot see the television or otherwise be distracted. #*Designate an amount of time to remain quietly in place, self-calming (usually not more than one minute per age of the child). As the system becomes more comfortable, the child might remain in place simply until he or she has achieved a calm state.
Then ask permission to come talk it over. The key is to allow the child time and quiet; give praise for a job well-done. Don’t think of timeout as a punishment; consider it a reboot.

, You need to become as adept at foreseeing the future when you have a child with ADHD. Anticipate what problems you might encounter and plan interventions to prevent them.Help your child develop cause-and-effect and problem-solving skills by troubleshooting possible problems together. Make it a habit to think about and discuss possible pitfalls with your child before going to dinner, the grocery, a movie, church, or other public places. Before leaving, have your child repeat aloud what was decided regarding rewards for behaving and the consequence for misbehaving.Then if you see your child struggling with behavior at that venue, you can ask him or her to repeat the agreed upon reward to be earned or consequence to be administered; it might be just enough to get you through!

Use positive input.,
Write house rules as positive statements.,
Use incentives.,
Transition to a points system for rewarding good behavior.",How to Deal With ADHD Kids6," You can get someone to cooperate better by asking nicely than by demanding or threatening. Those with ADHD are even more sensitive to the threats or demands, as they tend to feel that they’re “always” messing up or in trouble. Regardless of your parenting style or personality, it’s extremely important that you keep the input ratio weighted to the positive side: A child with ADHD needs to feel that he or she is being praised more often than criticized. The positive input must significantly outweigh the negative input to counterbalance all the feelings of failure that is encountered in a typical day.Praise your child for struggling and trying to do something good, rather than for success at anything.

, Whenever possible, invert house rules so they read as positives.For instance, instead of admonishing, “Don’t interrupt!” the rule can be reminded as “Wait your turn,” or “Allow your sister to finish what she was saying.”
It might take practice to flip those negatives from “Don’t talk with your mouth full!” to “Finish what’s in your mouth before sharing.” But work to make it a habit.

, With young kids, use tangible rewards to motivate kids to follow routines and directions. As children get older, you can move on to more abstract rewards. Below is this idea outlined with examples and a metaphor.


There’s an adage about a donkey moving faster for a carrot (reward) than a stick (punishment). Are you having trouble getting your child to bed on time? You can offer a stick (“Be ready for bed by 8 p.m. or else ….”) or you can find a carrot: “If you are ready for bed by 7:45 p.m., you can have 15 minutes to …”
Buy a little bucket and stock it with “carrots.” These can be little rewards you can dole out when your child complies with a directive or behaves appropriately. Get a roll of stickers, a bag of 20 plastic army guys at a dollar store or a sack of 12 sparkly rings from the birthday party aisle.
Get creative and add homemade coupons good for a popsicle, 10 minutes on the computer, playing a game on Mom’s phone, getting to stay up 15 minutes later, getting a bubble bath instead of taking a shower, etc.
In time you can cut back to intermittent tangible rewards.Instead, use verbal praise, hugs, and high-fives that allow you to continue a high degree of positive inputthat will motivate your child to behave while building his or her self-esteem.

, Once you’ve experienced success with the carrot bucket, wean your child from concrete rewards (toys, stickers) to praise (“Way to go!” and high-fives). Then you might consider designing a point system for positive behavior. This system acts as a bank where your child can earn points to buy privileges.Compliance earns points and non-compliance loses points. Record these points on a sheet or poster that is accessible to the child.
Design your schedule considering the unique aspects of the ADHD brain. Making a more successful schedule increases your child’s opportunity for praise and self-esteem. Make a checklistbuilt around the child’s schedule,showing the deadlines for completing tasks. Choose possible rewards that will motivate your child. This system also serves to externalize those motivations. "

Talk to your child’s pediatrician about dietary changes.,
Serve complex carbohydrates to boost serotonin levels.,
Serve protein to boost your child's focus.,
Choose omega-3 fats.,
Increase your child’s intake of zinc.,
Add spices to your child’s food.,
Experiment with eliminating certain foods.",How to Deal With ADHD Kids7," Be certain to run any major changes in diet by your child’s pediatrician. This includes changes related to vitamins and supplements.


Ask your doctor about any conflicts that could negatively impact your ADHD medication.The pediatrician can also suggest recommended dosages of various supplements and warn of possible side effects.For instance, melatonin may improve sleep in persons with ADHD, but it might also induce vivid dreaming which may be unpleasant.

, People with ADHD tend to have lower serotonin and dopamine levels. You can experiment with changes to your child’s diet in order to counter-effect these deficiencies to some extent.


Experts recommend a complex-carb diet to boost serotonin for improved mood, sleep, and appetite. Skip simple carbs (anything with added sugar, fruit juice, honey, jelly, candy, soda) that cause a temporary serotonin spike. Instead, choose complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, green vegetables, starchy vegetables, and beans. These all are digested more slowly, and sugars are “time-released” into your child's bloodstream. , Serve a protein-rich diet that includes several proteins over the course of the day to keep dopamine levels high. This will help your kid improve his focus.


Proteins include meat, fish, and nuts, as well as several foods that double as complex carbs: legumes and beans. Chicken, canned tuna, eggs, and beans are all great examples of protein sources that are usually cheap and affordable in the United States.

, ADHD experts recommend improving the brain by avoiding “bad fats” such as those found in trans-fats and fried foods, burgers and pizzas. Instead, choose omega-3 fats from salmon, walnuts, and avocados. These foods may help lower hyperactivity while improving organizational skills.

, Seafoods, poultry, fortified cereals and other foods with a high zinc content or taking zinc supplements are linked to lower levels of hyperactivity and impulsivity in some studies; however, there is limited research on this and you should speak with your child’s physician about potential benefits, if any., Don’t forget that some spices do more than add flavor. For example, saffron counters depression, while cinnamon helps with attention. , Some studies show that eliminating wheat and dairy, as well as processed foods, sugars, additives and dyes (especially red food coloring), can have a positive impact on behavior in children with ADHD. While not everyone will be willing or able to go to that length, some experimentation may produce improvements that make a difference. "
"
Ask your child’s doctor mental health professional about medications.,
Monitor side effects from stimulants.,
Ask about non-stimulant medication.,
Find the right medication.,
Use a pill container.,
Check in with your child’s pediatrician periodically to assess the prescription.",How to Deal With ADHD Kids8," There are two basic categories of ADHD medication: stimulants (such as methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (such as guanfacine and atomoxetine). Hyperactivity is treated successfully with stimulant medication because the brain circuitry being stimulated is responsible for controlling impulsivity and improving focus.Stimulants (Ritalin, Concerta, and Adderall) help regulate neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and dopamine). These medications can be short-acting or longer-acting. This means that the effects of the medication can last a short period of time, which can be useful for individuals who can manage their ADHD most of the time, or some medications can last throughout the day.Non-stimulants boost norepinephrine, a chemical in the brain that seems to help with attention span.These types of medications are longer-lasting as well.

, Stimulants have fairly common side effects of decreased appetites and trouble sleeping. Sleep issues often can be resolved by lowering the dosage.


Your child’s psychiatrist or pediatrician may also add a prescription to improve sleeping such as clonidineor melatonin.
For children ages 4-5, the primary treatment approach recommended is behavioral modification and parent training, with the option to use methylphenidate if behavioral techniques do not fully manage symptoms.Combination of behavioral therapy is recommended along with medication for all age groups, Non-stimulant medications may work better for some persons with ADHD. Non-stimulant anti-depression medications are often used to treat ADHD. These help regulate neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and dopamine).


Some of the side effects are more worrisome than others. For instance, youth taking atomoxetine must be monitored closely for the potential of having suicidal thoughts. Some side effects for guanfacine include sleepiness, headache, and irritability., Deciding on the right form, dosage, and specific prescription of medication is tricky because people respond uniquely to different medications. Work with your child's doctor and the most recent research to find the right form and dosage for your child.


For example, many medications can be taken in an extended-release format, which eliminates the need to deal with dosing at school. Some individuals decline regular usage of medication, taking it only in situations when they need the medication. In these cases, individuals want a fast-acting version.
For older children who learn to compensate for their ADHD challenges, medication may become unnecessary or be reserved for using during special occasions, such as when taking college entrance exams or finals.

, Children will probably need extra reminders and assistance in order to take their medication regularly. A weekly pill container can help parents keep track of medications.If you child is taking stimulant medication, it is highly recommended that parents control medication storage and monitor its use because the DEA classifies stimulants as having a high abuse potential.

, The medication’s effectiveness may change depending on certain factors. The effectiveness may change depending on growth spurts, hormonal fluctuations, diet and weight changes, and how fast your child's resistance to the drug builds up. "

Be prepared to revise/revisit the document in one year.",How to Create an IEP for Your Blind or Visually Impaired Child," Find out what information needs to be in your child’s IEP. Many states also have separate, more comprehensive requirements that will also need to be followed. Check to see if you can get a sample IEP from your child’s school or from a state education website. This may help you as you work on getting an IEP for your child. The requirements for a standard IEP are:Your child’s present academic achievement level;
Yearly goals for your child and how to measure them and a time schedule for these goals;
Any modifications or accommodations that your child will need at school;
An explanation of the implementation of any special education courses;
Any modifications your child will need taking a state or district-wide test
The date, frequency, and location of all services to be provided;
When and how you will be notified of your child’s progress;
Postsecondary and transition goals if your child is age 16;
, The school is required to meet with you within thirty days of your child being found eligible for special needs education services. Your child may need to undergo testing, assessment, or get a diagnosis depending on the school’s requirements. After you get the results, you will need to contact the school to report your child’s eligibility and set up a meeting. You can invite in experts who are familiar with your child’s history, as well. Remember that an IEP is not just a document, it is a meeting as well. The document cannot be created without first having a meeting with any and all pertinent staff and yourself.The IEP process can be quite long, with some taking full days to complete. If at all possible, clear your schedule for the day so that you do not have to worry about work or meetings.
The school is required to set up a time that works for your schedule; if you cannot attend in person, you can call or video in.
The creation of the IEP is the longest part of the process. Revising it each year typically goes more quickly.

, By law, certain professionals are required to attend your child’s IEP meeting. You might want to meet with some of these people beforehand to assess how your child is doing and to get on the same page before you start. The list of IEP participants include:Special Education Teacher
General Education Teacher
You and any other parent or guardian
Your Child
The Administrator

, Research the IDEA more thoroughly, particularly as it relates to your state, before your meeting. You may also want to bring this document with you so that you can refer to it during the meeting. Know that by law, the school has certain provisions they must abide by as it relates to your and your child. They must schedule the meeting to accommodate you, inform you of your rights, and provide an interpreter if needed., Gather all past records of your child, academic or medical, so you can review their history before your meeting. You may even consider distributing copies of this information to all people who will be in attendance at the meeting, if you feel comfortable doing so. You may also want to consider whether or not you believe this information shows the full picture of your child’s history as it relates to their visual impairment and academics in particular.You may find that you are missing some information. This will give you some time to gather it before the IEP meeting.
Gather records from doctors, teachers, therapists, or tutors. Consider other more informal information you may have gathered as well from family or friends.

, Before the meeting, be sure to come with a list of items that you would like to discuss with the IEP team. This will help ensure that nothing is forgotten during the meeting. As the parent, you have the most personal and longstanding knowledge of your child and you know their needs perhaps better than anyone. Be mindful of that and come prepared.For instance, you might make a note to not forget to discuss providing large print or Braille text for your child.

, Your child’s teacher will be spending a considerable amount of time with your child. Help them to make this relationship as positive as possible by sharing with them any need to know info about your child. This list could include allergies, issues your child may be having with other students, or just general information about their personality., During the meeting, you will be asked to discuss a few topics, one of those being your child’s strengths. Think carefully and thoughtfully about those beforehand so that you can use them to your child’s advantage. Discussing strengths helps the IEP process’ focus be more positive and can also be a confidence booster if your child is in the room., Think very carefully about what accommodations your child might benefit from most in school. Keep in mind that accommodations are different from modifications, which might include changes to the curriculum based on your child’s strengths and limitations. Be prepared to discuss your child's needs in the meeting and to back it up with your reasoning. Some accommodations might include:Large print or braille
Adjustment of lighting
Magnifying glasses
Having a test or assignment verbally read to them
Being allowed to provide answers orally
Being provided with an assistant to help guide them to classes
Additional time on tests or assignments

, Though you have a very comprehensive picture of your child and their medical and academic history, it can be helpful to also work with others so that you can create the best questions to ask and modifications to discuss in the IEP meeting. Talk to people who know your child or who have gone through the IEP process before. Your spouse or the child’s other parent can be of great assistance during this time., Whether or not your child participates in the meeting will depend on a number of factors, such as their age, emotional stability, anxiety level, and how this meeting might affect your child’s self-esteem. If your child will be attending this IEP meeting, go over with them the information that will be discussed. Find out if they have any requests that they would like to make during the meeting and empower them to make those requests. Though you can definitely speak for your child if they don’t feel comfortable, you do want to help them to begin standing up for themselves, as well.You might say something like “Honey, so you know we have the IEP meeting coming up. I wanted to talk to you about the process a little and see what thoughts you have. Also, you should know that you can speak at any time in the meeting.”
Decide on a way that your child can let you know that they would like to say something, such as by touching you on the arm. Before the meeting, you may also want to help them rehearse a question that they want to ask.
Even if your child is not participating in the meeting, you can still tell them about the IEP and see if they have any questions, comments, or suggestions.

, During the meeting, do not shy away from asking any questions that you might have. Also, make sure to find out who you can contact if you have questions that arise after the meeting or after the IEP is in effect. Though the professionals in the room are likely more familiar with the IEP process than you are, they are not more familiar with your child. Recognize and use the expertise that you bring to the table.You might say something like “I’m confused as to how we have set a goal that Vanessa will be able to find her classes on her own but have not identified how she will be able to do this.”
You could also make suggestions like “Perhaps a guide could ensure Vanessa gets to class for the first week on her own and then afterwards she could try alone.”

, Though you may be tempted to speak for them often, allow your child some autonomy in this process. If they are present and want to speak, do not interrupt them or explain away their concerns or feelings. This IEP is about them exclusively and you must all work together to ensure that your child is comfortable with the outcome., If your child's impairments are visual and not cognitive, general education is better for them. Special education classes should only be applied when absolutely necessary, such as if your child has a severe learning disability or cognitive impairment., In discussing accommodations or services, do not move on to another issue or topic until you are comfortable with the decisions being made. You can also decide to table a discussion if an agreement cannot be reached. You can address the issue again once other matters have been taken care of.Discuss whether your child will need services beyond the school year.

, If you feel completely comfortable with the provisions made for your child in their IEP, you can now sign off on it. However, even if you feel completely comfortable with the document, you may want to take 24 to hours to think it over before signing it. Do not feel pressured to sign right away. Also, keep in mind that the school is not allowed to implement any IEP until the child’s parents sign the document., If you cannot reach a decision on the day of the IEP meeting, there are options available to you. You can seek mediation, during which time both you and a representative from the school will meet with a third party mediator. You can also file a due process complaint., During the meeting, you and the IEP team will discuss how you will be given updates on your child’s progress. Typically, these updates are disseminated quarterly. You can choose to receive them by email, phone, in person, or through any other avenue that you might deem appropriate.Keep these progress reports so that you can discuss them in the next IEP meeting for your child.
You can also submit in writing that you do not want to be involved in the IEP process. If you choose this, the school will make all academic decisions about your child for you.

, The IEP is revised yearly. If you would like to remain involved in the process, be prepared to attend these meetings. During this time, you will revisit the goals for your child, determine if they have been met, and then make new goals. You can also discuss new accommodations or modifications that your child may need."
"
Figure out what might encourage your child to communicate and find symbols relating to the toys and activities.,
Lay out 2 to 3 picture card choices in front of the child on a clear table with minimal distractions.,
Encourage the child to pick from the cards, saying “You choose.”

,
Patiently wait until the child chooses, with your hand outstretched and open waiting for the child to place the card in it.,
Prompt the child to hand the picture card to you after they have picked it up.,
Give the child the item that corresponds with the card.,
Once the child understands how to use the cards, show them the binder.",How to Communicate With an Autistic Child Using the Picture Exchange Communication System," Laminate them and make a chart. Create your binder or buy a working PECS binder.


For children with poor fine motor skills, use thicker paper and larger cards. These will be easier for them to handle, and harder for them to break.
Also consider the child's sight when choosing the size of the pictures and binders. For example, larger cards may benefit long-sighted children or those who struggle with focussing on small objects.;
, Pick a time when your child is cheerful and their needs are met. If they're fidgety, have them sit on an exercise ball, or give them their favorite stim toy to manipulate as they look at the cards. Equally if they are tired or not able to concentrate, come back to it at a later time.


Choose cards that correspond to their routine. For example, if they will eat a snack soon, choose a picture of the snack they will be eating. If it'll be playtime soon, choose a picture of a game or activity you know the child will want to engage with.

,, The child may figure it out by themselves, or they may need a little help at first. If the child seems confused, here are ways to help them understand:


Explain it. A nonverbal child may understand words very well. For example: ""These cards can help you show me what you're thinking. This way, you can tell me what you want.""
Use the objects as props. Put the banana card on a banana, the doll card on the doll, et cetera. When the child reaches for the food they want, show them the card, and help them understand that the card corresponds to the object. Then give them the object.
Write a brief story in which a child needs something and uses the picture exchange to get it. Illustrate it with clip art and read it before bedtime.

, (This exchange shows that he or she wants that food, toy or to engage in that activity)


If the child taps the card, pick up the card and show it to them. This will encourage them to hand you the card in the future (since this will be a better way to get your attention).

, That is a small portion of the food, the object for a few minutes, or play a round of the game. This helps them understand that the card and the item correspond to each other.


For food, once they've eaten it, ask ""More?"" Try prompting them with the card again, so they will select it again if they want more.
Repeat the process with different cards, representing new choices and activities. This will help them ""get the hang of it.""

, Demonstrate how to take cards in and out of the binder, and show them where you keep it. This way, whenever they need something, they will go find the card and bring it to you.


Let them see you bringing out the binder when you are going to offer them something. It will encourage them to get the binder themselves.
Once they have mastered the basics, try adding cards that go beyond objects (e.g. ""Daddy"" or ""Pain"").
If you can't give them something, explain why. For example, if they pull out the ""Sister"" card, explain ""She's still at school. She'll come home at 3:00, when you have your snack, and you can see her then."" This helps them understand, and lets them know that you care what they have to say.

Communicate with specialists.To be an effective parent of a child with special needs, you need to be in regular communication with the doctors or specialists who treat your child.,
Make a list of needs.Being a parent of a child with special needs means that there will be particular things to take care of, some of them uncommon.,
Seek ways to safely handle stress.,
Spend quality time with your child.,
Plan ahead for making transitions.,
Alert your child’s school of his/her needs.,
Develop an Individualized Education Plan (IEP).,
Learn about how to use technology appropriately.,

Look for a support group in your area.One of the best ways to learn about being an effective parent of a child with special needs is to connect with a support group in your area.,
Consider hiring a consultant.,
Look at in-home care options.",How to Be an Effective Special Needs Parent," These experts will help educate you about your child’s needs, how to find help and support, and how to manage transitions in your child’s life. Even if you are already familiar with the kinds of needs your child has, these experts will closely monitor your child’s particular path of development, and keep you informed about new ways of caring for him or her.


Being a parent of a child with special needs can mean trying to understand lots of new concepts.You can do research on your own, but always make sure to ask your child’s specialists about any questions you may have.;
, Both you and your child will need help. You can start planning by making a schedule and list of the needs both of you have.


In caring for your child, you may need to schedule doctor’s visits, therapy sessions, and extra time to take care of his or her day-to-day needs.
In addition to caring for your child, you will also need to take care of all of your work and home tasks, and any personal necessities.
If you have a list of your child’s needs and of your own, you can share it with those that offer to help. For instance, a family member or friend could pick up your child from school or make dinner before you get off work; likewise, someone could mow your lawn for you when you need to take your child to the doctor.

, Parents of children with special needs should be realistic about stresses that arise. Feeling stressed doesn’t mean that you are a bad parent or that you don’t love your child. Finding ways to safely handle stress will make you feel better and, most importantly, take good care of your child.


Recognize that the expectations for your child may have changed. Seek ways to understand your child for who he or she is.
See a counselor if you have feelings like guilt, anger, denial, or depression. Talking about these feelings with a professional can help you understand and overcome them.
Counselors are also available if you are experiencing financial stress related to caring for your special needs child; talk to his/her specialists, a support group, or a community organization about where to find help.
Make sure to care for your own health by eating right, exercising, and seeing your doctor regularly. Keeping yourself as healthy as you can will reduce one potential stressor.
Take time for yourself; read, watch television, listen to music, pursue a hobby, or whatever else relaxes you. While you might feel guilty about taking time for yourself, you will be a better parent for your child if you also take care of yourself. Even a short break each day can help.

Exercise, meditation, and yoga are effective stress relievers.

, Setting aside time to share in the things your child enjoys will help you bond, and learn how to grow together. This is another way to take some stress away, and also an opportunity to learn about how your child is developing and about what makes him/her special.

, The stages of development and transitions that all children go through (starting school and entering adolescence/adulthood, for example) can be challenging. For a child with special needs, these may pose additional challenges.You can plan for changes by discussing them with your child’s specialists, and by talking about them with your child.


The specific plan will depend on your child’s needs and abilities. The important thing is to think ahead.
You may also consider talking to a counselor, financial planner, and family members about planning for your child’s future and adulthood to help make sure he or she will always be taken care of.

, If you learn of your child’s special needs before he/she begins school, make sure to let the school know about them as soon as your child is enrolled. If your child is already enrolled when you learn about his/her special needs, let the school know as soon as possible. That way, the school can evaluate your child and begin working on planning for his/her education., Schools that educate children with special needs will want to develop a particular plan for each one, known as an IEP.These plans are made in consultation with the child’s parents/guardians, and are designed to educate the child most effectively. They also usually entail regularly scheduled meetings (such as once a year or once a semester) between the parents/guardians and teachers or school officials, which can be a good opportunity for everyone to communicate about the child’s needs.


Schools are becoming increasingly better informed about caring for children with special needs. However, if your child’s school is unfamiliar with your child’s particular needs, take the opportunity to inform it by talking to the counselor or similar staff member at the school.
IEP meetings are also an opportunity for you to communicate with the school if you feel as though there are any areas that need to be addressed, such as bullying or inappropriate education.
The Department of Education maintains a great deal of information on educating children with special needs, such as on rights, grants, discrimination, advocacy, and concerns related to a variety of particular needs., One particular question to consider when raising a child with special needs in today’s world is how to integrate technology in his or her life. All kinds of devices are available. There are even some devices and programs geared toward children with special needs. However, the right kind and amount of technology to share with your child depends upon his or her needs, abilities, and development.Work with your child’s specialists to determine the right amount and type of technology to share. Sometimes, technology can benefit your child, but too much of it (or the wrong kind) might not be a good idea.
Consider encouraging your child to use devices and programs that can boost his/her social skills, mental development, or other areas of growth.
If your child has physical differences (such as hearing or vision impairment), ask his/her specialist about finding ways he/she can access technological devices and programs.
Check with the manual or user guide of a device or program for information about how to configure technology for your child’s use (restricting certain content, limiting time on the device, enabling accessibility modes, etc.).

, Alternatively, you may feel so overwhelmed that you don’t know where to begin seeking help. In either case, it is important to remember that you don’t have to act alone. You can start by accepting help from family and friends.


If someone offers you help, take them up on it!
Family and friends might offer advice like “be strong,” or “I know you can do it.” You may or may not find these comments helpful, but remember in most cases that people are trying to show they care about you and your child.
If you need family or friends to give you specific help instead of general encouragement, let them know. Show them your list of needs and talk about ways that they can help.
If you are in need, don’t be afraid to talk to your loved ones about getting financial help or assistance advocating for services that you child needs.

, These groups are composed of other parents or individuals dealing with a special need. They can help you learn about resources, fundraising, treatments, counseling, and other topics. Most of all, it is nice (and can even be fun) to connect with a group of people who understand what you are trying to do.


Ask your child’s doctor, counselor, or therapist about finding a support group in your area.
Some support groups are associated with schools.If the school your child attends doesn’t have a support group for parents of children with special needs, consider starting one.
The National Association of Parents with Children in Special Education (NAPCSE) works broadly to coordinate and advocate for parents and the education of their children.A support group is also a place to start if you think the needs of your child (and others like him/her) need to advocated for in the community. Talk to group members about ways to build awareness, take action, and make change. Remember that there is strength in numbers!

, Some professionals devote themselves to parents of children with special needs, helping them with access to services, getting organized, coordinating care, etc.Consultants charge fees, but can be very knowledgeable and helpful.

, If you are unable to take on all of the care because of work or other responsibilities, or if you just need assistance, you can look into in-home care services to help take care of your child. Some of these services charge fees; others may be covered under medical plans.


You can also see if family members (siblings, grandparents, etc.) are willing to be trained as caregivers to help you out. Many hospitals and social service agencies offer such training."

Purchase a soft, surgical brush with bristles that will not scratch or harm your child.,
Plan on brushing your child for three to five minutes a day for six to eight times a day.,
Brush in firm horizontal strokes along your child's arms, back, legs and soles of their feet.,
Observe how your child reacts to the brushing.",How to Brush Your Autistic Child1," You will have to provide ample pressure while brushing because a soft touch is seldom effective with many autistic children. These brushes can be found at beauty supply stores, medical supply stores and online if you can't find it anywhere else.;
, While this may seem like a lot, it only adds up to a small amount of time spent on brushing each day. This is the time that their nervous system will calm and they will be much more capable of integrating experiences, especially right after brushing is complete.

, You will notice a change in your child immediately. Repeat every few hours. If you child enjoys having other parts of their body brushed, you can add those parts too.


Use firm pressure with long strokes for best results.
Try not to let your fingers brush your child's skin as you brush; this can be distracting.

, The brushing process should feel comfortable to them. Try different areas and amounts of pressure and adjust them accordingly for your child. You will see what works, and what doesn't, very quickly.


Ask them how it feels, and if they would like you to press harder.
You may see redness, but it should not cause pain or discomfort.

"
"
Before brushing your child for the first time, try it on yourself.,
The first time you try it, demonstrate by brushing your own arm a few times.,
Watch your child closely to find times when they would benefit from the brush.,
Bring brushes with you when you go places.,
Make brushing a peaceful and enjoyable experience.",How to Brush Your Autistic Child2," Run the brush over your arms and observe how it feels, so you can describe it to your child.

, Explain that it feels nice, and how it will help them calm down. Hand them the brush and let them touch it and try rubbing it on their own arms (if they want to try). Then offer to brush them.

, If you watch them carefully, you will start to see when they begin to have difficulty processing all of the sensory stimulation going on around them. If you can see sensory overload starting, you can likely stop tears, opposition issues, and meltdowns before they start.

, Brushes can help children deal with transitions and schedule times (e.g. before school, airplane trips, bedtime, a birthday party).


Have brushes in multiple locations, so you won't need to search long for a brush.
Keep one in your bag or purse. This way, you can duck out to a public restroom, spot outdoors, or other quiet place to brush your child if they become upset. (Choose the quietest place you can, preferably in a corner or by a wall.)
Ask if they would like to keep one in their backpack at school.
The brush may become a comfort object for a child, and simply letting them hold the brush could help them calm down.

, Chat about your day, and ask them questions about theirs. If they are nonverbal, you can still tell them all about your day, just like you would with a friend. If your child associates brushing with relaxation and fun, brushing sessions will calm them even more.

"
"
Make certain that your child is receiving proper care.,
Work with your child at home on a daily basis to help them improve.,
Continue the therapies and activities throughout the development of the child’s life.",How to Care for a Sensory Child," Learn about Sensory Integration Disorder and apply your knowledge. Each child is unique, so take this into consideration while helping them. You must understand that your child is not going to grow out of it. Therefore, the first step is to seek out the best treatment possible. Many good Occupational Therapists research techniques that are exclusive to their patient’s behavior patterns.;
, With your Occupational Therapist, develop effective strategies that are distinct to your child that can be performed/practiced at home or at therapy. Suggested Sensory Activities Include:


Activities with textured objects such as play-dough in order to improve tactile processing.
Vestibular movement activities, such as swinging, swimming, and going on walks.
Aromatherapy techniques so that the child’s sensitivity to smell can be reduced.
Language activities such as flash cards to pronounce words.
Heavy work activities so that their bodies will develop an ability to receive regular input to their muscles and joints. Children can carry laundry baskets, help put away groceries, play with bowling balls, and pull their siblings in a wagon or on a blanket.
Sleep programs. Most sensory children have a hard time calming down to go to sleep. Therefore, the child may need help. It is necessary to sometimes comfort the child.
Play tunnels and tents are helpful to work on motor coordination. It is also helpful to include textured items inside the tunnel.
Deep pressure activities to help the child control their excitement/arousal level. This may include a ball pit, a weighted blanket, tight hugs, and more.
Auditory activities.

, Also, because these children are sensitive to many things, they can often become upset. Try using calming down corners and follow general meltdown prevention advice. If you notice that the child seems distressed, address the problem right away, before it turns into a full-blown meltdown. Kindness, patience, and understanding are the best ways to avoid a crisis.Don't push the child to participate in situations that they find overwhelming, as this may lead to a massive meltdown. If the child asks to leave or take a break, respect that, and allow them to do so.
Allow the child to stim. Stimming can help prevent meltdowns and challenging behavior, improve concentration,and aid the child in processing sensory input.Only intervene if the stim is harmful, in which case the child needs to learn a replacement stim.

"
"
Pick a quiet, relaxed time of day.,
Take precautions if your child melts down or shuts down easily in stores.,
Consider leaving the child's siblings behind.,
Remind young children about how to behave in stores.,
Set aside plenty of time for shopping.,
Have the child try on everything before buying it.,
Consider stimming opportunities.,
Point out clothes with their favorite color or special interest.,
Keep your receipts.,
Don't worry too much about their choices.",How to Buy Clothes for an Autistic Child," Go when you know that the store will be fairly empty. Make sure the child has just eaten and feels calm. This will help lower the risk of meltdowns.;
, Have them do something relaxing before shopping (e.g. special interest time, swinging, deep pressure activities). Pack some essentials in a bag or purse—Wilbarger brush, earplugs, hoodie, gum, stim toys, whatever soothes your child best.


Encourage them to stim as much as they need to.

, Shopping with an autistic child can be a time-consuming experience, and stretching it to include other siblings might be too much. If it's just the two of you, you can be done sooner, so you can go home and relax.

, You can read a social story about shopping, or give gentle reminders in the car ride. Don't simply tell them what not to do—tell them what they can do instead.


""There is no running in the store. If you have a lot of energy, you can jump, and we can go to a park afterwards.""
""Remember, if you're feeling stressed, tell me right away so I can help you.""
""If you want to take something down to look at it, remember to put it back where you found it when you're done.""

, It may take a while for the child to process everything around them, and hurrying them could lead to a meltdown. Make sure they can browse at their own pace, and have time to take a break in the bathroom if they get too stressed. Patience is key., Giving them plenty of time in the dressing room will help them notice any itchy fabrics, distracting tags, or horrible seams. Encourage them to put back any clothes that don't feel good, and assure them that it won't hurt your feelings.


This is especially important when buying fancier clothes, which are more likely to trigger sensory issues.
You may need to shop at several stores if your child has severe sensory struggles.

, Your child may especially love clothes that are fun to stim in, and this can help them feel happy and calm. Look at both opportunities built into the clothes, and big pockets where they can put stim toys and comfort objects. Here are some ways autistic kids like to stim with clothes:


Long skirts are fun for spinning.
Strings and zippers present fun fidgeting opportunities.
Fur is good for petting.
Chunky bracelets or bracelets with big beads can be twirled and spun in the hands.
If your child is putting their clothes in their mouth, get them some chewy necklaces or bracelets from a special needs store. These can be found online as well.

, Autistic people's preferences are more than what they physically can and can't handle. Think about their current favorite outfits, and point out clothes with similar designs and styles.

, This way, you can return items that turn out to be uncomfortable, and you can buy several copies of your child's favorite shirts and pants.


If a child/preteen absolutely loves an outfit, offer to buy it in a size or two up as well. Then as they grow, they can wear it more. (Be aware that anxiety can stunt growth, and they may stop growing in their teens.)

, It's okay to let them wander between the blue and pink sections, and it's fine if the clothes they pick aren't completely ""age-appropriate."" It's more important that the child finds clothes that they will enjoy wearing.

Give yourself time to cope.,
Start reading.,
Find resources.,
Build a team of trusted individuals to help your child.,
Look into therapies for your child.,
Learn to advocate for your child.,
Accept that your child will be different.,
Teach self-efficacy and self-love.,
Remember your child's strengths.",How to Cope With a Baby Being Diagnosed With Special Needs," A new diagnosis is not easy. It will change your vision of the life you will have. Remember not to blame yourself, your spouse, or your child. It's nobody's fault, and it will be okay. (Really!)


Take care of your own needs, not just the needs of your child. You need to be at your best!;
, There are plenty of books about different disabilities, and the internet is full of disabled people who can describe their lives and talk about what helped them most. Ask a librarian to help you find a section of books about your child's disability.


Remember to read resources not only by medical professionals, but by disabled people themselves. Sometimes medical professionals do not have the complete picture, and disabled people are the best experts on their own lives.
Read about the disability culture. Autistic culture and Deaf culture are two prime examples of rich disability cultures that your child will enter.

, A child with special needs will present you with unique challenges, and you don't need to face them alone.


Look for support groups in your area. Search on the internet, or ask your doctor.
See what disabled adults recommend. For some disabilities (e.g. autism), there are tons of disabled adults online. For others (e.g. Down Syndrome), communities mostly consist of family members.
Ask other parents and disabled adults for advice.

, As your child enters school and undergoes various therapies, it is important that they feel supported and cared for. Members of the team can offer great insight and expertise to help the child be the best they can be.

, Speech therapy, occupational therapy, and sensory integration therapy are all examples of resources that your child can have.


Always check with the disability community before starting a therapy. Some therapies, such as behavior therapies like ABA, carry a high risk of abuse and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The disability community can testify whether a therapy helps or hurts.
Ideally, therapy should be fun and playful, and the child should be able to ask for a break when needed.

, Sometimes, you will need to deal with bureaucracy, but politeness and stubbornness can be your allies.


As your child grows older, they will start being able to advocate for themselves.

, They may not follow the regular developmental schedule, they may do things that don't seem ""age-appropriate,"" and they may look different to others. All of this is okay. Your child is an individual, and your child doesn't need to blend in to be happy.

, As your child grows up, they will become more and more capable. Encourage their capabilities, and help them learn to become self-reliant. Disability does not equate to powerlessness.


Love them for who they are.

Encourage them to make choices and ask for things. Do they want grape juice or apple juice? Do they want to put on their sweater, or not? This will help them gain confidence to make bigger choices and speak for themselves.
When they communicate a need or want, congratulate them for doing so. Then do what they want, or explain why you can't and offer an alternative.
Encourage them to begin ordering their own food, rather than having you tell the waiter/waitress.

, In all the disability rhetoric, it can be difficult to remember that a disabled child is more than a list of deficits and delays. Focus on your child's individual strong points, and spend time together that builds on them.

Set aside a corner in the building.,
Make the area comfortable.,
Find ways to minimize sensory input.,
Add a few sensory tools.,
Place some basic activities in the corner.,
Try out the corner when you aren't stressed.,
Explain the basic purpose of the corner.,
Ask them not to interact with you when you are using the corner.,
Ask them to avoid making noise nearby when you are in the corner.,
Come up with a plan for when you need to use the corner.,
Tell them you're happy to interact after you're done using the corner.,
Take the child aside and show them the corner.,
Accustom your child to the idea of the corner.,
When the child appears upset or overwhelmed, quietly ask if they would like to use the calming down corner.,
When the child is in the corner, give them quiet time.,
Let the child leave the corner when they are ready.",How to Make a Calming Down Corner," Pick a place that will be quiet, with little activity from people passing through. Barriers (walls, plants, furniture) that block off parts of the room are especially helpful.;
, Pillows, blankets, weighted blankets, stuffed animals, beanbag chairs, and soft rugs all make the place feel more relaxing.

, Try a radio with a white noise CD, chairs with large backs to block the view, curtains, and other ways to isolate the corner.


Some people like to curl up underneath or behind objects. Try creating a makeshift tent, or using furniture in unconventional ways.

, This could involve...



Audio: a radio with soothing nature sounds or instrumental music

Visual: Drawings with the user's favorite color, snow globes, photo albums, blankets/pillows in calming colors

Tactile: Fidget toys with various textures, and soft stuffed animals or pillows

Olfactory/Gustatory: Lollipops, hard candies, candles, sweet-smelling lotions or soaps, chewy toys or jewelry

Proprioceptive:Weighted blankets, beanbags, deep pressure vests,brushes, lotion

, This provides something to do while calming down. Examples include books, sketchbooks, stim toys, coloring books, puzzles, logic games, et cetera. Take special interests into account when choosing activities.

, Sit in the corner for 20 minutes before bedtime, and see if you have enough activities to keep you occupied. Try to imagine what you might need or want when you are stressed.


Remember that when you need to use the corner, you may be too stressed or overloaded to grab additional activities. The corner should have enough to keep you occupied at any given time.

, If you're autistic, explain what sensory overload is, or show them an article or two. Emphasize the need for limited sensory stimuli during recovery.

, Disruptions, however well-meaning, only worsen sensory overload and distress. Explain that they should only interrupt you with urgent matters (e.g. an appointment in ten minutes), and save other things for later (e.g. the cool rock your sister found in the backyard). For minor questions, such as what you want for supper, they should choose for you.

, For example, if the corner is next to the master bedroom, it would be a bad time for your mother to start rearranging the bedroom furniture or watch a TV show with the volume up high.

, Should you choose a code word to say that you need the corner? If you are autistic and become nonverbal, can you develop a hand signal to indicate that?

, This helps them understand that it isn't personal; you're just overwhelmed at the time and are open to hearing from them later.

, Explain that this corner is a place you put together just for them, and that it is there for them whenever they are feeling overwhelmed or upset. Make it clear that they can go there whenever they want.

, Depending on the individual child, it may take time for them to understand the concept. Here are some ways to help your child understand:


Allow your child to explore the corner when they are feeling calm. Keep it open-ended, and let them play with the toys.
Talk about meltdown management with your child. Explain that going to the corner can help them feel better.

Use social stories to demonstrate correct use of the corner.

, If the child says yes, lead them to it. Once the child is accustomed to the corner, they will usually agree to go if they are upset, or even decide on their own that they need to use it.


Remember that the calming down corner is not a time-out or punishment, but a voluntary opportunity to take a break and calm down.

, Avoid talking to them or making noise nearby. Leave the room if the child is old enough to be alone, and read a book or magazine on the other side of the room if not. If ambient noise cannot be helped, turn up the white noise in the corner.

, Congratulate them on using the corner so calmly, and ask if they are feeling better now. Then talk about any problems that preceded the incident, and resume the day.

Choose a theme.,
Modify activities to make them more accessible.,
Make sensory bins.,
Add sounds and smells.,
Use edible items for sensory play.,
Create your own ball pit.,
Consider adapting popular games for your child.",How to Plan a Play Date for Your Blind or Visually Impaired Child1," If you want to plan a sensory play party for your blind or visually impaired child and their friends, a theme can help keep the activities simple and understandable. Your theme should be a common thread running through all the activities in some way.For example, you might want to have a construction party, and use objects related to building and construction work, such as blocks, hard hats, shovels, and other machines.
Think not just of occupations, but also places. For example, if your child really enjoyed a recent trip to the beach, you might have a beach-themed party and bring the beach into your own backyard.
When picking a theme, get your child involved so you can choose something that sparks their interest.;
, Particularly if you have several different activities planned for your sensory play party, you want to make sure all activities are accessible to all children and clearly separated from one another.Think in terms of both auditory and tactile cues to enhance the children's understanding of each activity and the objective. For example, you might place a soft rug or mat on a hard surface to indicate a particular area is reserved for a seated activity.
Use bright, high-contrast tape to mark off the bounds of each play area so the children can more easily understand where one activity ends and the other begins.
Keep the area simple and uncluttered, and remove objects that are unrelated to the play date.

, Sensory bins are wonderful tools that can help your child focus and engage their senses. When planning a sensory play party or play date with other kids who don't have visual impairments, put lids on the bins or have those kids put on blindfolds so they can have a similar experience.This can also help teach the other children empathy, as well as making the activities equally challenging for all the children.


Start with a large plastic storage container, then choose a filler such as rice or sand. Your filler need not be expensive, and may vary depending on the other types of objects you plan to include.
Add other objects with a distinctive shape and texture compared to the filler you've used. For example, you might place marbles of varying sizes in a tub of sand.
Include tools for scooping and sifting the filler so the children can find the objects buried in the bins.

, When planning a play date for your blind or visually impaired child, you want to incorporate as many of their other senses as possible. Sounds and smells can help your child differentiate between things that are typically identified by sight.For example, you might hang pots and pans of various sizes on a fence. You can get many different types of pots and pans at a thrift store relatively inexpensively — you don't have to use the ones you normally cook with. Hang all the objects and give the kids different things to bang them with, such as brushes, wooden spoons, mallets, and spatulas, so they can experience the different sounds that are created with different combinations of objects.
Infuse plain jello with different essential oils so that the children can dig their hands into the jello and release the aroma. Talk about what the smell is and what types of objects or experiences are associated with those smells.

, Edible items engage your child's sense of taste, which is crucial for blind or visually impaired children as they explore the world around them. Having different tastes for different colors can help your child start to recognize and understand the concept of colors.Some examples of edible items you can use include spaghetti noodles, edible play dough (look online for recipes), and tapioca balls.
You can cook spaghetti with food coloring to add bold colors. Lay the colors out on a white tarp to create a squishy rainbow for the kids to explore.
Try to keep your taste and color associations consistent. For example, if you associate red with cherry flavor in one activity, don't associate it with strawberry for another activity — this could cause confusion.

, Many blind or visually impaired kids love ball pits, but it can be dangerous for them to go into public ball pits along with other sighted children. However, you can eliminate this danger by making your own.Use an inflatable wading pool so the pit is soft, then get some balls for the pit. You can find suitable balls and most toy stores and discount stores.
Consider using balls of different sizes to enhance the sensory experience. If you have any choice, choose high-contrast colors so visually impaired kids will be better able to distinguish the different balls.

, While a sensory party is usually pretty relaxed, with an emphasis on exploring and making messes, you may want to also throw in a few more challenging games or activities to help your child feel a sense of accomplishment. Ask your child what they would like to do, and see if you can make the necessary accommodations.


Look for sensory-based board games, or games that have been adapted for blind or visually impaired children by adding braille or tactile markers. Games like checkers, tic-tac-toe, even card games can all be made accessible to your child with just a few tweaks.
Another example is if your child is visually impaired but can make out very bright colors, you could adapt a game of t-ball by placing bright orange cones at each base and using bright tape leading to each base so the child knows where to run.Or, if your child wants to play kickball, you can allow the children to either kick the ball from a stationary position or from a pitch. Your blind or visually impaired child can kick a stationary ball and have a friend run with them, guiding them around the bases.

Paint with tennis balls.,
Use scented crayons or markers.,
Make collages.,
Draw and color.,
Stick with high-contrast colors.",How to Plan a Play Date for Your Blind or Visually Impaired Child2," If your child has some sight but is visually impaired, this activity can be a fun way to create bold abstract art with a group of kids. For this project, you'll need large white paper, paints, tennis balls, and a small plastic wading pool.Use puffy paint or add sand to the paint to incorporate a tactile dimension for kids who are blind.
Pick paints in bold colors, and secure the paper to the bottom of the wading pool. Have the kids dip the tennis balls in the paint, then drop them in the pool and roll them around.
It helps to have several kids for this project, especially if they're younger, so they can lift and move the pool together. This also teaches them cooperation.

, Scented crayons and markers incorporate the sense of smell into the art project, helping your blind or visually impaired child distinguish between colors by associating them with a particular smell.You can buy scented crayons or markers at specialty arts and crafts stores as well as many discount stores.
If you buy more than one set of crayons or markers, make sure the scents and colors match up. Having the same color with two different smells can cause confusion.

, Collages are a great way to incorporate different textures, and help your child further develop their sense of touch. Many blind or visually impaired children also enjoy working with glue and sticky surfaces.Prepare the collage surface by covering it with glue using a glue stick, or using double-sided sticky tape. That way the whole surface is sticky and the child can place objects anywhere they want.
Use a variety of different textures, and talk to your child about the different textures and where they are commonly found. For example, you might include something soft and fuzzy, a piece of felt, and pieces of sandpaper.

, You can buy coloring books or sketchbooks with raised lines, so your blind or visually impaired child can experience coloring objects by feeling the edges. You also can trace the lines of a regular coloring book with puffy paint pens to get the same effect.Scented crayons or markers allow the child to have a better understanding of the colors they are using.
Have the child trace the lines with their finger and talk about what object is represented by those lines.

, Visually impaired children will be better able to differentiate colors if you simplify your color palate and only use colors that contrast sharply with each other, such as red and blue.If your child or children who will be present at the play date are colorblind or have color sensitivity issues, keep those in mind as you choose your colors.
Keep contrast in mind with other items as well. For example, if you have a game involving Cheerios, place them on a navy blue or black surface so they will contrast sharply and be easier to see. Use white surfaces for dark or brightly colored objects.

Spend time in a park.,
Go to a local petting zoo.,
Check at libraries and museums.,
Play in the water.,
Visit a farm to pick berries.,
Take a group of kids fishing.",How to Plan a Play Date for Your Blind or Visually Impaired Child3," There are numerous activities at your local park that can provide sensory stimulation, education, and enrichment for your blind or visually impaired child. A play date at the park also is a great idea if your child has a friend without significant vision impairment.You might pull up plants and examine the roots with your child, or catch bugs. They also may have fun exploring playgrounds, swinging on swings or running their hands over the equipment to see how it's put together.
If you live in the United States, you might try NPR's directory of accessible playgrounds nationwide. Just visit www.playgroundsforeveryone.com and type in an address to begin., Because petting zoos focus on the senses of touch, smell, and hearing, they can be great places for a blind or visually impaired child to explore the world and connect with different kinds of animals.The animals at petting zoos typically are very calm and tame, and will allow your child to explore them.
Talk to your child about the animal they are touching, the part of that animal the child is touching, and what that animal does. When the child touches a different animal, talk about the differences between the two.

, Many libraries and museums have play-date type activities specifically designed for blind and visually impaired kids. These events can help your child explore their community as well as giving them the opportunity to meet other blind or visually impaired kids their age.Your local library or community center may have a bulletin board where information about activities and events are posted. You also may be able to find this information on the library's website.
If your city government has a community events page on its website, you also may be able to find information there.
Ask at local museums, especially children's museums, to find out if they have special events or specific days for blind or visually impaired kids.

, If your child enjoys the water, backyard water slides, wading pools, or fountains can provide a fun activity for a play date, especially on hot days. You don't have to get fancy – often a simple garden hose is enough.Keep in mind that if there are too many elements, they can get overwhelming. Try to limit your water play activities to one or two things.
If your child doesn't like cold water, you might try running the hose from the kitchen sink so you can use warm water.
If you make a slide in the backyard, you can use other liquids on the surface, such as whipped cream, so the kids can enjoy different sensations. Just make sure the liquid you use isn't too slick.

, If you live in or near a more rural area, you may be able to find a working berry farm where you can take your blind or visually impaired child along with a friend. Picking berries engages your child's senses of touch, hearing, and taste.This also can be an educational experience, because the child will learn where berries come from and how they are harvested.
Call ahead to the farm before you go and let them know you will have a child who is blind or visually impaired. They may be able to offer specific accommodations, or may have special events for blind and visually impaired kids.

, Fishing is another activity that is both fun and educational. While you'll typically have to help with things like baiting the hook and removing the fish from the line, blind or visually impaired kids can still actively fish themselves.Catching a fish can give your child a sense of accomplishment. The process also teaches your child where fish come from and how they are caught for eating.
Holding and touching a fish presents a unique sensory experience for the child, who will be able to feel the muscles in the fish and the flapping gills.
If you go somewhere that doesn't require catch-and-release, you also have the opportunity to take the caught fish home and cook them. This will give the child a better sense of how food gets to their plate.

Opaque or glare-reducing shades can be lowered from the top or raised from the bottom. Blinds or shutters can also work as well, it allows you to control how much light comes into a room. , Whether it's on their desk, in their reading area, where they sew, or the place where they use the computer, place a goose-neck lamp next to their work space, so you can increase light and make it much easier for them to see when doing a certain task.Many companies provide lighter light bulbs, which create natural daylight, and can be very helpful with your child's visual disability who needs light in their work areas., If you have a staircase, placing lighting over it such as strip lightsor wall & step lightsmake it easier to for your child to go up and down the stairs safely.Make it easy for your child to adjust the lighting and brightness so that it can suit their visual needs.


Place lighting over the places on the staircase where accidents are more likely to occur.Avoid using extremely bright lights, as this can actually be even harder to see and will do more harm than good for your child's eyes, especially children with albinism, aniridia, or other conditions that cause photophobia., Fluorescent lighting may be helpful for a child with low vision. Fluorescent lighting disperses its light evenly over a wide area. It produces fewer glare spots because of its even lighting. The light also remains cool, even at very close distances.The problem with fluorescent lighting is that it can flicker at some points, increasing eye strain over time. It could also increase glare for those with cataracts or corneal problems., Incandescent lighting is yellow and provides more direct light. It's usually best for close work, such as sewing or reading. This type of light is easy to tolerate for your child, however, might not bright enough for some.Incandescent light can become hot and overheat after prolonged use or with higher wattage., Halogen lighting is best used in lamps in very specific areas that focus light. It can enhance contrast between print and background for some. The light is extremely bright, is very intense, and white. A lot more of the energy is efficient than the incandescent lighting.Halogen lighting can be extremely bright for a child, even causing glare for some. It should not be for a long, prolonged use because it can generate a lot of heat., Ensure your can easily reach light switches from doorways and from their bed without your support.You may need to move certain light switches around to make it easier to reach, and easier to switch on and off. Consider installing light switches and picking out lamps that allow you to change the brightness settings, so your child pick the setting that suits them best., Accidents and spills happen, but they should not be left alone. If you or your child spill a liquid on the floor, it should immediately be cleaned up. It can be extremely dangerous leaving the spill there with your child's visual disability, possibly making them trip and fall down.Teach your child how to clean up spills independently in case you are not around. If a spill left alone, your child can forget it's there and possibly hurt themselves. If you live with multiple family members remind them to always clean up if they have caused a spill for your child's own safety., For younger children with low vision, consider locking the your storage areas such as the cabinets, drawers, or closets with safety springs or latches.These storage areas can be slammed and shut easily, causing serious injury to your child's fingers. It's also incredibly important to close these cabinets if they contain dangerous products like cleaning supplies, chemicals, sharp materials, or tiny objects.Keeping it locked will prevent your child from getting seriously hurt.


Consider using magnetic cabinet locks or cord cabinet locks to child-proof your cabinets. They're simple to attach on and are good at child-proofing your storage areas., Ensure the house is always clean. After you or your child have done a task (e.g cooking, woodwork, sewing, etc) always pick up after yourself and store the materials in a proper place for later. Trash should be picked up and thrown away. If there are certain objects in walkways that must remain there, place railings around the house so your child can identity where they are.After your child is done playing with their toys, encourage them to clean up after themselves and to store the toys for later use, such as in a toy box or toy chest., Couches, chairs, tables, beds, drawers, cupboards, and house decorations should all be stable. The furniture should not wobble or move around if touched. The furniture should also be in good condition, especially if it's used frequently by your child.Avoid choosing furniture that has tears, holes, or rips as this can be choking hazard for younger children.

, If you have small rugs around the house, secure the edges to prevent the rug from moving and harming your child.Tape the rug edges are with duct tape so the rug doesn't move around if stepped on. Place multiple layers of duct tape on the rug to thoroughly secure it., For younger children with low vision, it's important to cover electrical outlets such as power outlets, extension leads, phone chargers, computer cables, etc.These areas can cause extreme harm to your child if they're used incorrectly. Use electrical outlet caps cover the outlets, preventing your child from using them You can also electrical outlet covers if you'd prefer not to use regular outlet caps. These are easy to install and fit standard outlets., The floor, windows, countertops, gutters, roof, cupboards, drawers, pipes, and carpet should all be in check. There should be no cracks, holes, or loose placements in your house as this can cause an accident. Make sure everything is in check daily to ensure that there isn't something that could leave your child getting hurt.Examples include:


Broken railing
Cracked floor
Loose carpet
A leak in the ceiling

, Instead of regular blinds, use mini blinds to place on the windows. Mini blinds are a highly recommended window covering, because they can be altered during the day to eliminate glare., If you own a television, you can make it easier for your child to see by turning the screen away from the sun or a lamp, so the light source is behind the screen and not straight at it. This will prevent glare from producing., If you own shiny tabletops or countertops, you can cover them with tablecloth to avoid glare from forming when light hits it. Avoid using plastic tablecloths as these can form glare as well. Use cloth material to avoid glare from producing at all, making it easier for your child to see., When polishing the floors, avoid using wax as this causes glare and can be hazardous to walk on for your child. Instead of using wax, use a flat finish to avoid the glare from appearing.Flat finish does not reflect light and will not allow glare to appear., Instead of flat paints, matte paints are shiny and reflect light in a mirror-like direction, causing it not to provide glare. This can be useful to avoid glare from forming onto the walls for your child., Your child may prefer a certain color that they find easiest to see and the color they like.For example, your child might prefer the color red or yellow. If they do have a specific color they like, use it to call attention for items that belong to them. Your child could own a toothbrush and cup for themselves that matches their preferred color, so they know and understand it belongs to them.


You can also use your child's preferred color to help them keep their room organized. Use different colored boxes or baskets for storing their toys., Avoid having too many checker-designs, swirly-line shaped patterns, and markings all over the house. This not only makes it physically difficult to see for your child, but can also make it even harder to safely move around the house. Avoid floors that have checkered patterns, stick to basic wood floors or floors that are smooth.

, This makes things much easier to spot for your child. For example, you can place a black switch-plate on a white wall, or a beige chair against a dark wood wall.Color contrasting makes it easier to spot the object you need or are working with. Consider using this method in their bedroom, the bathroom, areas where they do activities and play, etc.

, It may seem quite odd, but letting each room have a color scheme makes it easy to identity so your child can know which room they're in. Your child may want the bedroom red, but then the living room green.If you have multiple bathrooms, consider having one bathroom to resemble a blue color scheme, letting another bathroom be brown. Color schemes not only make it easier to figure out the room you're in, but also make it safer for your child., To help your child see doors and windows with ease, buy brightly colored glass so they are able to see more clearly. Consider getting turquoise, red, dark orange, or purple glass so they can identify where the glass doors and windows are, which can be helpful if they need to open it independently., To help identify where the doors are for your child and help them open them with ease, paint the door frames a different color than the door. If the door is black consider painting the door frame white. If the door is red, paint the door frame yellow. The color contrast make it much safer to open and close doors for your child., Pick out tools and materials that make organizing and labeling easier for you. You may want to consider getting:


White 3 x 5 inch index cards
Jumbo colored paper clips
Colored adhesive labels
Colored electrical or plastic tape
Wide-tip markers
Flair felt-tip pens
Laundry markers
Velcro
Braille cards or magnets, if your child can read braille
Tactile marks
Foam alphabet letters
Self-stick magnetic tape

, On plain white 3 x 5 inch index cards, write the name of the household supply using a black wide-tip marker, a laundry marker, or a felt-tip pen so the letters can come out big and bold. Stick the labels by placing the label on the supply and wrapping it with a rubber band.That way your child can identity certain materials that need to be seen. If your child is completely blind or has lost most of their sight you can help your child by:Tie different-textured ribbons around the opening of a container.
Place a different number of rubber bands around each container that's different.
Transfer items to different shaped types of containers.

, Try labeling items or objects using a braille labeler, if your child can read braille.You can also label items using a tactile marker or 3D pen.If your child is completely blind or has low vision, have your child use their sense of touch to organize and label by sticking Velcro, self-stick tape, or foam alphabet letter on the boxes to identity which box is which., Keeping storage areas organized and tidy makes it easy for your child to get items independently. For example, on a bookshelf, you may want the first shelf to have all the books and the second shelf for all the magazines. Storing items this way makes it less complicated for your child to search for the things you need ahead of time.Examples include: The top shelf in a closet having all the blankets, the second shelf having all their shoes.
One box storing all their comics, the second box storing all their novels.
One drawer storing all their colored socks, another drawer with all their white socks.

, To help your child roam around safely, install rails and handles that are easy to grip and grasp. It may help to install them in rooms where your child spends most of their time in such as their bedroom, the playroom, the bathroom, and even the kitchen.Ensure the walkways are clear so your child can walk safely when they use the rails or handles., Consider placing tactile marks in different areas around the house so your child can identify what belongs to them or where specific areas are in the house. You may want to place only one tactile mark on a certain object or many, so your child can identify it easier.Examples include:


Placing a tactile mark on your child's side of the closet.
Placing a large tactile mark on the hot faucet in the bathtub.
Placing multiple tactile marks on their toy box.

, Wrap rubber bands around door knobs and certain possessions that belong to your child, such as their toothbrush or spit cup. Wrapping a rubber band around an object can help them know which item belongs to them.Wrapping rubber bands around door knobs can also help them know ahead of time what room they're about enter. For example, you might place a rubber band on their bedroom door knob so they can know they are about to enter their room.Consider placing different textured rubber bands to help your child recognize more easier.
You may also want to place a different number of bands so identifying is easier for your child.

, To help your child identity the most dangerous or important areas of the house, place small or medium-sized pieces of Velcro on these areas, or use tactile marks, so they can feel the texture and know what it is.Examples include:


The oven
The hot faucet on a sink
The stovetop knobs

Consider your child's sensory needs.,
Presume competence.,
Use visual cues when asking questions if echolalia becomes a problem.,
Don't rush communication.",How to Communicate with Your Autistic Child1," Consider their sensory needs: touch & movement, smell, taste and texture of foods, sight, hearing/sounds. Provide a calm environment to reduce intrusive stimuli, and


If a child is overwhelmed, they may avoid a certain stimulus, recoil, or act like they are in pain.
If a child is understimulated, they may appear hyperactive, and seek out ways to fill their sensory appetite.;
, Assume that your child can understand you, even if they don't look at you or react immediately. Talk to them using the same level of language that you use for their siblings, or for their classmates. Respectful parenting matters.Professionals, especially in ABA, may underestimate your child.Challenge your expectations about what attentive body language is. Autistic children may fidget, look elsewhere, or otherwise use body language that is different from non-autistic body language. That doesn't mean they aren't listening.
Don't treat them in a way that you wouldn't treat a non-autistic child.

, When asked a question like ""Do you want a banana or an apple?"", some children will automatically respond ""apple."" This can cause frustration for the child, and they may not know how to express that this is what they actually want. Confirm this choice before moving forward.


Ariane Zurcher uses pointing to confirm her daughter's choices. For example, ""Point to this hand if you want an apple, and this hand if you want a banana.""Other visual cues could include picture cards, or holding up the objects (when applicable).
If your child can reliably answer yes/no questions, try asking one of these to confirm. ""You want a banana?""

, If an autistic person feels pressured to provide a quick answer, they may have a harder time gathering their thoughts into words.Use patience and let them take as much time as they need. Your flexibility can reduce anxiety around communication and make talking easier.


If an autistic person is silent after a question, it may be that they are thinking about how to answer. Some autistic people have trouble identifying emotions and hunger, so they may need to think deeply about these things.

"
"
Get your child's attention first.,
Speak clearly to your child.,
Ask specific questions.,
Be mindful of figurative language.,
Teach important words like ""no,"" ""stop,"" and ""help"" to beginning speakers.",How to Communicate with Your Autistic Child2," Say their name so they know you're talking to them (and not to someone else).Wait for them to look at you or in your direction.


Autistic people ""zone out"" sometimes. Say their name again if you need to, or walk into their field of vision and try again. If they are reading a book or watching a show, ask them to pause first.
If you aren't sure, it's okay to ask ""Are you listening?"" If they say yes, then keep talking.

, Parents have found it helpful to speak to their autistic child the same way they would speak to the child's non-autistic siblings or classmates. Use full sentences and explain things as needed (for example, explaining that something is upsetting you).


Some therapists recommend speaking in simplified sentences such as ""want ball."" However, this can be vague and confusing to the child.

, Questions like ""How was your day?"" may be confusingly broad, and your child may not know where to start. ""How did science class go?"" allows them to narrow in and figure out how to answer you., Sarcasm, idioms, and rhetorical questions may be confusing to autistic children, who tend to take things literally. Introduce these when your child is ready, and be aware of the possibility of misinterpretation.

, The right to express boundaries is important (especially for disabled children, whose desires may be walked over by well-meaning adults). It can also help prevent frustration buildup or aggression.


Some autistic children hit because they don't know how to say no, or because people do not listen to them when they say no."
"
Let your child hear people talking.,
Find a type of AAC for a child who cannot speak yet.,
If your child uses echolalia you should model proper sentences for them to use.,
Play people games (peek-a-boo or ring around the rosy, blowing bubbles and catching them), use modeling in starting the game.,
Try using creative ignorance.,
Pause when telling stories or singing a song to see if they fill in the blanks with the right word.

,
Help your child to communicate for a new reason.,
When eating snacks, be the keeper of the treats.,
Help them to communicate the need for your help.,
Point to objects and label objects near and far in view.,
Use their special interest.",How to Communicate with Your Autistic Child3," Talk to your child, have conversations nearby your child, and encourage other family members to do the same. Hearing more words will help your child learn listening skills and vocabulary, and can speed up your child's linguistic abilities.

, The earlier your child can begin communicating, the better they will be able to express wants and needs (and the less frustrated they'll get). AAC is usually a stepping stone to verbal speech, although some autistic people remain nonverbal or partially verbal into adulthood.Picture Exchange Communication Systems
Picture/word boards
Typing
Baby Sign (e.g. the Baby Einstein video ""baby's first signs"")

, For instance, if your child says to you ""Do you want to use the potty?"" which is what you may have asked them 2 minutes ago or 2 days ago. You know they are trying to communicate that they need to go potty so model the sentence ""I need to go potty"".

, You ask ""Are you ready?"" If the child echo's the question you next model the correct response ""I'm ready!"" be animated in your voice and how you express yourself.

, Pretend you forgot how to play the game to see if they will lead, or remind you what to do.

,, If they can say ""milk"" see if you can prompt them to use more words by waiting for them to fill in your sentence. Pretend to accidentally spill a little milk. Then say ""Look, mommy spilled ....""

, You hold the bag of goldfish crackers and give them one to eat this will prompt them to ask for more. If they say nothing model the word “more?""

, Use a photo or hand sign for help which is one hand held out, palm up place fist on the flat out hand with thumb up. Take the second hand and lift it off the first saying ""Help?""

, Eventually they will learn to point and request. Put objects in a clear container on a shelf out of reach but in view to see if they will point our hand lead you and get them to request with a point, a word, even a glance at first to encourage them to communicate a request.

, Start by asking questions about their favorite topic, or a topic that is very closely related. Your child may be eager to open up and share their passion with you.

Figure out what triggered the meltdown.,
Stick to a routine.,
Communicate clearly with your child.,
Distract the child if you suspect the cause is emotional/psychological.,
Change the child's surroundings.,
Give your child some space.,
After the meltdown, discuss it with your child.",How to Calm an Autistic Child1," Finding the cause can help you keep them away from whatever is upsetting them. This is important in calming an autistic child. Observe your child and try to figure out the triggers for certain behaviors. If a parent or guardian is aware of the child’s triggers, they may be able to avoid it.


Keep a notebook to record the child's common triggers will help you to prevent triggering meltdowns. You might also consider using a smartphone app to log meltdowns and their causes.
Some common triggers for meltdowns in autistic children are changes or disruptions in their normal routine, overstimulation, frustration and communication difficulties.Meltdowns are different from tantrums. Tantrums are thrown on purpose, as a power play, and will stop once you give in. Meltdowns occur when an autistic person becomes so stressed that they cannot control themselves, and they feel powerless and will not stop until it has run its course.;
, When there is a routine to be followed, the child can predict what will happen next. This helps to keep the child calm.


Illustrated schedules can help the child visually see the routine for the day or week.
If you know that there will be changes to the routine on a given day, make sure you take the time to prepare your child. Talk to them beforehand and communicate these changes clearly and patiently.
When introducing your child to a new environment, it best if you do it when there is less stimuli. This means bringing your child at a time when there is less noise or fewer people.

, Verbal communication is a source of frustration for many autistic children. Talk patiently, respectfully, and enunciate clearly.


Avoid shouting or adopting an aggressive tone, as it may worsen the meltdown.If verbal communication is difficult for your child, try communicating through pictures or other forms of AAC.Remember that communication goes both ways. Always listen to your child, and make it clear that you value and respect what they have to say. Ask them questions if you need clarification to prevent frustration-related meltdowns.

, When your child is upset, you can sometimes calm them down by diverting their attention. Try playing enthusiastically with a favorite toy, watching a favorite video, or listening to a favorite song. If possible, involve their special interests.


Distraction won't always work. For example, questions about your sister's rock collections might distract from her fears about getting a flu shot, but it won't fix things if her problem is that her dress seam feels like fire ants on her skin.
Once the child is calm again, it is a good idea to talk to them about what made them angry or stimulated them in the first place. Ask them what happened and work together to find ways to prevent it from reoccurring., Your child may be upset because they are hypersensitive and overstimulated. When this happens, it's a good idea to simply bring the child to a different environment, or to change the environment (e.g. turning off loud music), to reduce overstimulation.


For example, if your child finds fluorescent lights, it is better to take your child to a room with alternative lighting, rather than forcing the child to put up with it.
If the child is in a location where the environment cannot easily be changed, take precautions. For example, you could give your child sunglasses (to prevent hypersensitivity to light) or earplugs (to drown out noise) to wear in public places. Brainstorm precautions with your child.

, Sometimes, children just need time before they feel ready to re-engage.Try letting them sit for awhile to calm down, usually in any area with limited sensory stimuli.


Consider safety. Never leave a young child alone and unsupervised, or lock someone in a room.Make sure the child is safe and able to leave if they want.

, Use a solution-based approach: instead of blaming or punishing your child, talk about ways to prevent meltdowns and better cope with stress.Try talking about:


What the child believes caused the meltdown (Listen patiently).
How similar situations can be avoided in the future.
More effective coping strategies (taking a break, counting, using deep breaths, asking to leave, etc.).
An escape plan to end future meltdowns.

"
"
Use the OWL technique.,
Use the 3 ""I's"" to encourage communication between your child and you.,
Try the ROCK technique.",How to Communicate with Your Autistic Child4," Observe what the child is doing, wait for their cues, and listen to your child's words, sounds or sentences. You can then learn what you need to build on.


Ex. if the child uses sounds ""pah"" or ""bah” you could model an emphasize words for them to use when they make those sounds like ""park” or ""ball”. Face to face is the best place to be using OWL.

,



Include your child's interest.

Intrude in what they are doing (gently, of course!). If your child likes to sit alone studying their dolls, cars, or books, try playing next to them. You don't need to get a dialogue going; silent interaction or peaceful parallel play also work.

Imitate. If they are spinning or sitting looking through a book, then sit or stand next to them and do what they are doing. See if they stop what they are doing to look at your book. If they come over start talking about the book you are reading and the pictures. If they don't, then they are probably just enjoying your company.

,


Repeat what you say and do
Offer opportunities for your child to take their turn
Cue your child to take their turn
Keep it fun! Keep communication going!

"
"
Apply deep pressure.,
Give your child a deep pressure massage.,
Try a pillow press.",How to Calm an Autistic Child2," Autistic children frequently have sensory processing differences, which can be stressful or even painful. Applying deep pressure causes muscles to relax.Try wrapping your child snugly in a blanket or lay several blankets across them. The weight of the blankets will create soothing pressure, but be sure not to cover their face to prevent interfering with breathing.
You can order or create tools designed to provide deep pressure online. Weighted blankets, toys, vests, and lap pads are all possibilities.

, Massage is a good way for you to interact with your child, while applying deep pressure, which may strengthen the parent-child relationship.Position the child between your legs. Cup your hands on the child’s shoulders and apply pressure. Then, move your hands slowly over their arms and shoulders.


If you do not feel comfortable, consider asking a massage therapist for tips. Or, ask someone you know who gives really good back rubs.

, A pillow press is done by positioning the child on a soft surface such as a pillow or a couch cushion. Let the child lie or sit down, then use a second pillow or cushion to apply deep pressure to the torso, arms and legs in a slow pulsating manner.


Never cover the child's face to prevent accidental suffocation.

"
"
Understand how vestibular stimulation exercises work.,
Swing back and forth.,
Twirl the child in a chair.",How to Calm an Autistic Child3," The vestibular system contributes to balance and sense of spatial orientation. Vestibular exercises help to calm the child down using swinging or rocking motions.Repetitive motions sooth and refocus the child's attention on their physical sensation.

, Place the child in a swing and gently push them. Adjust the swinging speed, slowing down or speeding up, until your child is calm. If swinging seems to make things worse, stop.


It may be a good idea to install an indoor swing to best incorporate technique. This can be accessed no matter what the weather is.
Some children can swing themselves. In this case, gently suggest they go to their swing.

, Spinning is a stimulating vestibular exercise.This activity will likely stop a meltdown by diverting attention from the trigger and redirecting it to physical sensation.


Office chairs tend to work best because they swivel easily.
Make sure the child is firmly seated and spin the chair slowly to avoid injury.
Some children will prefer to leave their eyes open, while others may close them.

"
"
Target only one behavior at a time.,
Talk with the child about the behavior, if possible.,
Keep a log, if you can't ask the child.,
After keeping this log for several days to a week, try to identify the cause of the behavior.,
Fix the underlying problem.,
If the problem behavior does not decrease, then you have not found the right solution yet, or they are not developmentally ready.,
See what happens.,
Celebrate their initiative.",How to Make a Behavior Intervention Plan for an Autistic Child1," Different negative behaviors likely have different causes, and thus different solutions. Typically, it is too difficult to address all of these at once. Additionally, focusing on one thing is more likely to be successful.;
, If your autistic child can explain why he or she does what he does, that is an excellent place to start. The behavior may be a solution he or she has come up with to solve a problem (such as humming in class to drown out unpleasant sensory input). In this case, your goal is to expand their repertoire of ways to solve the problem.Encourage self-advocacy.Teach the child to speak up, using words or AAC. Reward this by paying attention and respecting what they have to say.
Explain other people's thoughts and feelings in a clear, concrete way. It may help to draw stick-figure pictures, with thought bubbles, where you and the child can write down what others are thinking., To identify possible reasons for the behavior, keep a log of what happens before the behavior, the behavior itself, and what happens afterwards. It won't be as direct as asking the child, but if the child cannot speak or use AAC, it is your best bet.


Example log entry: At 4:30, Joey came into the kitchen and grabbed two cookies. When I told him he could not have them, he began to throw a tantrum. When he calmed down, I gave him a cookie.
After math class, Marcia and her peers went to the school assembly. Marcia grew increasingly agitated as we waited, and began chewing on her fingers. This escalated until she was viciously biting her own arms. An aide took her to the office so she could calm down.

,


Joey's tantrums are the result of a desired item (cookie) being taken away after he tried to access them inappropriately. Brainstorm possible reasons: perhaps Joey is very hungry at 4:30, and wants to express that he needs something to eat.
Marcia began biting herself as she waited for the assembly. School assemblies can be quite loud, and perhaps they feel frightening or painful to her. Anxiety about a painful assembly could cause the biting.
Be aware that what causes an autistic person to act out may not be obvious to non-autistic people. For instance, it may not be obvious why at first that a child has issues in one bathroom, but never the other. However, it may turn out to be a flickering light or fan that irritates the child, but they cannot express this.

, Remove the stressor, and/or teach them a way to handle it when it arrives. If it is successfully addressed, the problem behavior will cease.


Joey can be taught to ask for a snack (""I want a snack, please""), or taught to show you a picture of a snack when he is hungry (Picture Exchange Communication System).
Marcia bites as a way to cope with the stress of waiting for a painful assembly. She can be given chewy jewelry for when she needs to bite, taught to say ""that hurts"" when she is hurting, and kept in class with a helper and a box of crayons during assemblies.

, Go back to making a log, and trying to figure out what causes it.


Research how autistic people have handled situations like this. The internet is full of autistic writers. The hashtag #AskAnAutistic is an easy way to contact them.

, If you have correctly identified the cause of the problem behavior and provided a solution that works for the child, then they will begin to use the better strategy instead. This will take some time and gentle reminders, but if the child is capable of using the new strategy, it will happen.


When the child uses the bad strategy, gently remind them to use the new one: ""What do you say when you want a snack?""
Never hold their needs hostage. Address a frightening or overwhelming situation right away, regardless of whether they handled it ""correctly"" or not. The child needs to know that you will help them if they are hurting.

, When the child uses a good technique (e.g. speaking up or getting a stim toy), praise them for doing well.Explain that you're glad that they're self-monitoring, and taking steps to get what they need.


For example, ""Thank you for telling me that it hurts, Marcia! Now that I know, I'll make sure you don't have to do it again.""

De-escalate if you see stress building up.,
Minimize talking.,
Give them an AAC device.,
Have an exit strategy ready, including scheduled rewards if needed.",How to Make a Behavior Intervention Plan for an Autistic Child2," If a child's ""fight-flight-or-freeze"" mechanism has activated, they may not be able to control themselves, even though they know that it's not good to hit people or scream in public. The best way to stop it is to prevent it from getting that far.Never get drawn into a power battle. Forcing control upon a child will make them afraid of you, and it won't make them respect you more.

, When stressed, a child may have trouble with auditory processing, and not be able to understand what you are saying.In these circumstances, talk less, and instead focus on de-escalating.


Try to use nonverbal communication. For example, instead of asking ""Do you want your bunny?"", show them the bunny so they can grab it if they want. Instead of saying ""Let's go outside,"" point to the door and have them take your hand so you can lead them out.

, When stressed, the child might lose the ability to speak, while still being able to use AAC. Handing them a device shows that you aren't going to pressure them to speak, and that you'll listen if they advocate their needs.Watch for deteriorating speech abilities. If an ordinarily articulate girl points to a peanut shell and cries ""bug,"" then she might be having trouble processing things,and may communicate better with AAC.
If they have several forms of AAC, let them choose. If they are more overwhelmed, a simpler form will do better. For example, maybe your student is too frazzled to type, but can show you the picture card for ""too loud.""

, For example, if a boy knows that when he gets into the car, he will get a tasty snack, and he can play a game at home, he might be more willing to leave the park.Implement the strategy if you see stress building. (You can always come back later, once the child is calmer.)


Explain the exit strategy beforehand—don't wait until the child is mid-meltdown. Use visual supports, like a keyring with pictures, if needed.Tailor the rewards to the child's favorite things. Make sure that they are available; if you run out, the child may stop trusting the routine and stop doing what you want.
Older children might be able to self-monitor, initiate the exit strategy when needed, and do it without rewards. Younger children might need you to watch their mood, and reward them more for following through.

"
"
Keep a daily routine.,
Encourage sensory regulation.,
Make a calming down area that the child can use as needed.,
Recognize that not all autistic ""behaviors"" need to be changed.,
Watch for anxiety disorders.,
Keep communicating and enjoying positive interaction.",How to Make a Behavior Intervention Plan for an Autistic Child3," A predictable routine can feel safe to autistic children. It can be especially helpful to make a visual schedule, so that they can see exactly what is going to happen.Try cards that can be rearranged, or a dry-erase board, to account for changes in routine.


Pictures can also help support the child's memory, because some autistic children may have difficulty remembering important things.For example, if they have a picture of homework on days when they have homework, it can help them remember.

, Sensory needs can interfere with self-control and other abilities,so keep them on a healthy sensory diet. Provide a calming, low-input environment for hypersensitivity, and have activities prepared for sensory seekers.

, Because autistic children struggle with self-regulation, having a quiet space where they can retreat can help them balance themselves when they are overwhelmed or moody. Encourage the child to use it whenever they need to.


Place stim toys and ways to block sensory input in the corner. Divide it from the rest of the room with a curtain, shelf, or other barrier.
Leave the child alone when they are using the corner., Just as autistic people work hard to accommodate non-autistics, non-autistic people need to be helpful and understanding towards autistic people. If a behavior is not harming anyone, then non-autistic people need to learn to accept it.Don't micromanage.

, Autistic children are at risk for anxiety, and may need anxiety medication or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to keep it under control. Managing any anxiety disorders can help the child be healthier and happier.

, Maintaining a good relationship with the child is important for both people's well-being.Do fun things together, talk to them, and take time to listen carefully to what they have to say (whether it's verbal or not)."
"
Presume competence.,
Recognize that no behavior is meaningless.,
Be cautious about assigning motives to the behavior.,
Don't confuse ""they can't"" with ""they won't."",
Respond with patience and compassion.,
Focus on rewards, not punishment.,
Provide love and acceptance.Show the child that you care about them, autism and all, and that they are not a burden to those around them.",How to Make a Behavior Intervention Plan for an Autistic Child4," Begin with the assumption that the child is capable, they mean well, and they are trying hard already.Help them rise to meet your expectations. Optimism can lift the child's spirits, and bring positive results.

, Even if it doesn't make sense to you, it is fulfilling some sort of purpose for the child, or expressing something.There is a reason; you just don't know it yet.

, Each person thinks differently, and these differences can be especially profound between autistic and non-autistic people. The child's reasoning may be completely different from what you think it is., Gaining abilities is not a linear progression,and if a child is stressed or worn out, they might not be able to do things that they otherwise could.If a child is resisting your attempts to make them do something, it might be that they can't do that thing at the moment,or that they don't understand.For example, instead of ""Jamal is angry and won't tell me why. He's so difficult!,"" you could think ""Jamal is angry and can't tell me why. Maybe he's too upset to speak. I'll help him calm down, and then maybe I can figure out what's going on.""
Sensory input, exhaustion, stress, seizures, anxiety, and more can affect ability levels. For example, perhaps your daughter can usually put her plates in the dishwasher, but after a night of bad sleep and hearing pots clanging in the kitchen, it is too overwhelming one day.

, This may be frustrating to you, but chances are, it is even worse for the child. Responding kindly can lessen the child's stress, making it easier for them to communicate or do a difficult thing., Remember, positive strategies help more than negative ones. The child will see you as a friend and ally, not a punisher.


Autistic children might not be able to understand why they are being punished, making it completely ineffective.Be a team. You are not the child's opponent, nor are they the passive object of a project.The child needs to feel that you care about their feelings, that you'll listen to them, and that they can come to you with problems.
Never make basic needs contingent on a certain level of behavior. An autistic person may resort to ""behaviors"" when under extreme duress, and they may not be capable of producing the desired solution at the time.

, Make it clear that you don't need them to pretend to be ""normal.""Encourage their strengths, embrace their uniqueness, and make it clear that you love them just the way they are.

Explain the instructions for an activity or a task slowly and clearly.,
Learn how the child prefers to communicate with you.,
Use auditory, visual, and tactile cues.,
Work with the child’s special needs, not against it.,
Celebrate the child’s achievements, even if they are small.",How to Be Patient With a Child With Special Needs1," Special needs children can have difficulty following instructions and remaining on task. You can help the child focus on a task by sitting down with them and laying out the instructions for an activity or a task slowly and clearly. Maintain eye contact when you do this and make clear facial expressions. Do not talk too fast or too loudly at the child.Some special needs children have difficulty reading facial expressions as well as verbal or physical cues. You may want to try drawing out the instructions for an activity or a task to show the child how the activity will be done. You can do this using very basic drawings, such as stick figures, or a more comic strip style drawing, with more detailed figures. The child can then look at the drawing and better understand how to do an activity or a task.;
, It can also be helpful to observe how the child communicates with those around her and with you. Some children with special needs have difficulty verbalizing their discomfort or their needs. They may use physical cues instead, such as touching your arm or waving their hands at you. Some children may prefer making facial gestures at you to show that they need something or are trying to figure out how to do a certain action.If you are taking care of a child with special needs temporarily, you should discuss the child’s preferred communication cues with her parents before she is under your care. Most parents are aware of their child’s cues and are good sources of information on how to best communicate with the child.
Avoid pushing, poking, or shouting at the child, as these communication cues will often scare the child or cause her more distress. Aggressive actions toward the child should be avoided, as they are usually not effective., If you are not sure how the child prefers to communicate, you may try auditory, visual, and tactile cues. You may try repeating certain words or phrases to help calm the child down if she is acting up. Singing these phrases in a low voice, for example, singing “be quiet please”, can help to soothe the child. You can also try clapping, whistling, and humming as a way to quiet down the child.You can also use visual cues to calm the child and teach the child how to behave in public. You may draw images to represent calm and quiet and show the child these draws to get her attention. Over time, she may understand that certain images mean certain things, from being quiet to going to the bathroom to getting ready for bed.
Tactile cues can also be useful, such as gently touching the child’s shoulder or the side of her face to get her attention. You can also offer tactile objects to the child as a way to calm her down and to get her to focus her attention on a calming activity. For example, you may offer the child a blanket made of soft material or silly putty that she can play with as a way to occupy her with a safe and engaging task.

, You may be struggling to control your child’s behavior, especially in public where others may judge you or the child, and be frustrated that you cannot get your child under control due to her special needs. But rather than fight against the child’s special needs, you should try to find ways to accommodate the child’s special needs. This will allow you to view the child’s special needs as a challenge, rather than an obstacle or a problem to be fixed.For example, rather than get upset that your child with Down’s syndrome has trouble speaking and communicating her needs with you verbally, you may try to find other ways to help her communicate. You may take photographs of the step by step process of how to get dressed in the morning and show her the photographs so she understands what to do. You may also repeat phrases consistently in front of her so she hears and remembers these phrases. For example, you may try to say “Good morning” to her every morning so she understands this is a typical greeting for that time of day.

, Focus on the positive aspects of your child’s special needs by recognizing her achievements, even if they seem small and insignificant. This could be the moment she speaks her first complete sentence or the moment she understands what someone is asking her to do in a new or challenging environment. Show your child that you appreciate her achievements through facial gestures and positive language.You may also reward your child by giving her a small treat or taking her on a special outing. This will help to build her confidence and allow you to remind yourself of the many positive aspects of having a special needs child.

Wait for the decision.,
Meet with an attorney if denied benefits.",How to Apply for SSI for Your Child," SSI payments are for unmarried children under age 18 who have a qualifying disability.A qualifying disability is defined as having a physical or mental impairment(s) which results in marked and severe functional limitations and has or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months or result in death.The SSA publishes a listing of impairments for children. If the child’s disability is on the list, then this is usually enough to establish that the child has a qualifying disability. However, the absence of a listing does not mean that the child cannot still be deemed sufficiently disabled for benefits.SSA also publishes a “compassionate allowances” listing. The list allows SSI to get benefits quickly to those who invariably qualify.If the child's condition is listed in the “compassionate allowances” database, then your application will likely be approved quickly.
The list of compassionate allowances can be found here.
Along with the age and disability benefits, the household must qualify under income and asset guidelines. The SSA has a complex formula for determining who financially qualifies and does not qualify for benefits. Very generally, a child may qualify if their two-parent household has only earned monthly income below $4,158 or if their single-parent household has only earned monthly income below $3,424.The income thresholds are too complicated to summarize here. If you have any question about whether your child is eligible, contact SSA at 1-800-772-1213 or send an email at this page.;
, The SSA will need a large amount of medical, financial and other information to review your eligibility. Keep the documents in a handy file because you will need to take them with you to your interview at the SSA. You should gather all of the following:Name, address, and phone number of every doctor, therapist, hospital, and clinic that has seen or treated your child in the last year.
Any medical records that you already have, including the dates the child was seen or treated and the child's patient ID numbers, if known.
Medications the child is taking. These can be found on the medicine containers.
Child's medical assistance number, if any.
Names, addresses, and phone numbers of any schools the child has attended in the past 12 months, including the names of teachers, psychologists, counselors, speech, and other therapists who have seen or treated the child.
The child's Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) for early intervention services or Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for special education services, if your child has one. Also any other school records in your possession.
Names, addresses, and phone numbers of any social service program and the name of the caseworkers that have information about the child.
Name, address, and phone number of another adult who helps care for the child and can help SSA get information, if necessary.
An original or certified copy of the child’s birth certificate. If the child was born in a different country, then you need a document that serves as proof of U.S. citizenship or legal residency.

, You will also need information about your household, including financial information. You should gather the following:Names and Social Security Numbers for all the children and adults who live in the household.
Proof of current income for the child and family members living in the household, e.g., pay stubs, self-employment tax returns, unemployment or other program benefits, child support.
Proof of resources for the child and parents living in the household, e.g., bank account statements, life insurance policies, certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, etc.
Names, addresses, and phone numbers of any employers the child has had.

, This form is available here. It simply helps you organize all of the information and documents you will need in such a way to prepare you for completing the Child Disability Report and for the interview with the SSA.

, You cannot complete the application for SSI online. However, if you complete this Disability Report online, then SSA will have a chance to review it and contact you if they believe they will need additional documents or information that you can bring with you to your interview.


The online Child Disability Report can be found here. You may also print off a PDF copy from this website.
If you prefer, you can call 1-800-772-1213 and explain that you want to file an SSI application for a child.A form can be mailed to you.
You may also go to your local Social Security office and fill out the form. You can find your local address by using this locator and typing in your zip code.

, Within a few weeks of submitting your Child Disability Report, you will receive a letter from the Social Security Administration. This letter will give you a date, time, and location for your interview, as well as remind you of the documents that you should bring with you to the interview in order to complete the application process.

, Go to the Social Security office on the date and time stated in your appointment letter. Take all of the documents that you have gathered, plus any additional documents requested in the appointment letter. Personnel at the Social Security office will help you complete your application.

, When the SSA has made a decision, they will send you a letter advising you of the decision. It can take three to five months for this decision.Be sure to update the SSA with any changes to your address, phone number, or other information while you wait.

, If you are denied SSI benefits, you should meet with an experienced SSI benefits attorney. An experienced attorney will make the best case possible for benefits and relieve you of the work necessary to build that case.To find an experienced attorney, contact your state's bar association, which should run a referral service.


Federal law limits the amount of fees an attorney can charge. Typically, the attorney will represent you under a contingency agreement. Under this arrangement, the attorney will be paid a portion of your benefits award if they are successful.Federal law limits the amount to 25% of the back benefits or $6,000, whichever is less.You will probably have to cover costs, such as photocopying records. Ask upfront for an estimate of costs.
You are strongly encouraged to use an attorney for your appeal. Having an attorney will significantly increase your child’s likelihood of being awarded benefits."
"
Consider if the child has been mistreated in the past.,
Look at the child's communication skills.,
Consider ways you may have misbehaved in the past.,
Consider whether you could be scary to the child.,
Look at the environment.,
Ask the child's family members and loved ones, if you can.",How to Gain an Autistic Child's Trust1," Some autistic children have faced severe bullying or abuse (including therapy abuse) that may make it difficult for them to trust other people.


A child who doesn't feel safe is unlikely to be trusting.
A child who was harmed physically or emotionally by adults, or whose requests for help were ignored by adults, may not trust adults.
A child can be just naturally shy. Don't feel bad if this is the case.;
, If the child isn't able to reliably express their needs, then it's less likely that their needs will be met. When adults don't meet a child's needs, the child struggles to trust them. If a child can't speak or use AAC reliably, helping them learn to do so is crucial.If the child can only use a very limited type of AAC (such as PECS or buttons to press), a therapist should be helping them expand their repertoire so they can learn to express more complex thoughts and sentences.

, If you have interacted with the child before, and they don't seem to like you, it could be because you did something that was rude or inconsiderate.


Did you try to force hugs, kisses, or eye contact?
Did you respect their need for quiet time when they got overwhelmed?
Did you trick them?
Did you treat them with respect?
Did you coerce or lie to them?

, Adults can be large and scary, especially if they are unpredictable or noisy. Do your best to stay calm and consistent when you interact with them.


Unexpected sensory input, such as touch from behind or a sudden shout, can be scary to an autistic person.
Many autistic people find it scary to look into someone else's eyes. Don't try to make eye contact, and consider wearing sunglasses so that they don't need to worry about your eyes at all.

, If a child is hypersensitive to sounds, light, et cetera, then a busy environment may be uncomfortable and distracting to them. If the surroundings are upsetting, then they can't relax enough to interact well. This isn't an issue of trust, but discomfort.


A quiet, low-key environment is good for a hypersensitive autistic child. When they aren't startled or distracted, they may be able to open up better.

, They may have insight regarding why the child is shy or withdrawn. They can also tell you what scares or upsets the child, so you know to avoid doing these things.


If you are going to be doing activities with the child, you can also ask the family about the child's favorite things, to give you ideas.
For example, Rose likes playing with toy cars and climbing trees. A caretaker can use this to their advantage, so Anne can play something related to climbing trees with Rose.

Look for toys that stimulate their senses.,
Choose toys that help social interaction development.,
Find toys that help to develop motor skills.,
Consider toys that emphasize or provide room for organizational skills.,
Always be considerate of the child's skill levels.,
Don't overdo the functional play.,
Remember that there is no ""correct"" way to play.,
Select quality over quantity.,
Search online.,
Look for toys that match the child's special interests.,
Search for outdoor toys.,
Consider making toys with your child.,
If the autistic child has siblings of a similar age, see if there are toys that they can share.,
Try choosing toys that encourage parent/child play.",How to Choose Toys for Autistic Children," Many autistic children have sensory challenges, particularly tactile defensiveness. Toys can be an excellent way to introduce tactile sensations in a low-key, non-threatening way, in which they have total control. Suitable toys might include:


Books with cloth, foil, yarn, etc. attached to them—you can even make your own
Blocks with raised lettering or numbers (this appeals to the ordering need as well)
Toys with bumps, fur, raised elements, ridges, etc.
Musical toys and toys that make sounds
Hard board books for children prone to tearing - allow them to tear the wrapping paper as much as they wish!;
, Teaching all children cooperation through toys is an important rite of growing up. For autistic children, socially interactive toys are even more important for helping them to develop coping mechanisms when interacting with the wider world. Board games are excellent for this, especially when the whole family pitches in to play together. Focus especially on the issue of taking turns and that losing is not a big deal. All children need to learn these skills but the frustration element can be very intense for autistic children.

, All children need to develop motor skills, but autistic children are especially likely to struggle in this regard. Painting and drawing are good choices, and trying fingerpainting can help sensory issues (if the child is able to try it). Developing balance might be tricky if the child refuses to ride a tricycle or bicycle. A lot of encouragement and patience will be required, as well as understanding that it might never happen. Trampolines are excellent but make sure it is safe and always be present.

, Functional play does not only help the child with their weaknesses; it also encourages them to build upon their strengths. Autistic children are often skilled at creating and understanding systems. You can encourage this by buying toys that allow them to design cars, construct elaborate towns for their dolls, and employ their visual skills. It may inspire them to go into STEM at an older age. Look for...


Building blocks
Toys that can be taken apart and reassembled in different ways
Puzzles and brain games
Dollhouses or toy towns to organize
Buttons and beads (consider choking hazards)

, Less complicated toys are better for younger children or ones with greater sensory or intellectual impairments; simple push-button, open and use toys are best. For children with stronger skills, building, creating, discovering, connecting, etc. toys are generally fine.

, Sometimes, it is fine to let your child simply enjoy a line of toys that is pure fun.

, The point of playtime is to have fun and relax—not to behave exactly like other people want you to. Allow your child to be themselves. It's okay if their playtime looks a little different from that of other children.

, Too many toys is always too many toys. For autistic children, it can feel overwhelming and crowding. It is better to choose one good quality toy over many cheaper toys that will clutter your house. If you hit the right choice, that one toy will provide many hours of enjoyment.

, There are numerous stores catering to toys for autistic children, offering advice and good ideas. There are also many, many guides on what toys to get for autistic children. Have a good read to inform yourself and apply the most appropriate ideas to suit your child – every child is different, and every form of autism is different, and you know your own child's needs and interests better than anyone else.


Find out what autistic writers loved when they were children.
Consider stim toys as well as traditional toys.
Some autistic children will do typical imaginary/interactive play with others, while tending to focus on stimming or systematizing play when by themselves.
Be careful of websites that emphasize ""appropriate play."" The goal of these websites may be to make autistic children look normal, rather than to help them have fun and improve their skills.

, Encouraging the child's passions will help them feel supported and understood. (It may also eventually lead to a fulfilling career for the child—a girl who loves fire trucks may someday design them.)

, Exercise is important for all children, and autistic children are no exception. (It may also provide an outlet for extra energy.) Encourage the child to play both by themselves and with others. If they are anxious by nature, encourage collaborative rather than competitive play.

, If you have an older child, they may enjoy going through the creation process with you. For example, show the child how to make yarn dolls, or sew a doll.

, Examples include balls, sidewalk chalk, art supplies, and sports gear. This gives an opportunity for the siblings to hang out together.

, This will help you or the parent bond with the child, and get to know how their mind works. It also provides an opportunity for the parent to model social skills in a relaxed, enjoyable environment. Autistic children are unique individuals who are worth getting to know.

Talk to your children and explain the tasks they'd be doing.,
Assign buddies.,
When an opportunity arrives for the older buddy to do a task, tell them of it.,
Once the younger buddy is able to fend for herself, let the older buddy quit.",How to Start Using the Buddy Method in Your Family," Make sure they approve of the idea. Depending on age, some of the general tasks a buddy does are listed below.


Changing the younger buddy's diaper

Getting the younger buddy dressed
Helping the younger buddy learn to read
Cutting food for the the younger buddy
Making sure the the younger buddy brush and floss their teeth
;
, Usually (depending on the age of the younger one), the older one may be from ages 8+ or until the younger ones can fend for themselves.

, Do not be harsh; even though they agreed to it, it wouldn't normally be their task.

, If the older buddy doesn't want to quit, let her help with a different sibling.


Keep in mind that the buddy method isn't just a method, but more of a relationship. Oftentimes, even after the younger sibling can care for himself just fine, that special bond still remains.

"
Make sure there is adult supervision at all times.,
Establish consistent rules and routines with the child.,
Have an alternative plan in the event of an issue or problem.,
Move the child to a safe space.,
Take a moment for yourself when necessary.,
Use humor to defuse a tense situation.",How to Be Patient With a Child With Special Needs2," To ensure your child feels safe and supported, you should ensure there is an adult or several adults on hand at all times.This could mean you and your partner supervise her at home, making sure one parent is always present in the room with her. Or, during an extracurricular class, you should make sure that one adult is interacting directly with the child and other adults are supervising other child in the class. This will ensure your child is not at risk of getting hurt or getting into a situation where she might be uncomfortable or upset.

, You can also give your child a sense of balance and stability by reinforcing a set of rules and routines.Establish a daily routine where the child eats meals at the same time and goes to school or recreational classes on the same days of the week.
Establish basic rules around behavior, such as a rule for when the child can leave the table after a meal or a rule on how to greet someone new. These rules and routines will help your child to feel secure and also work to counter any issues or problems your child may be having.
You should also ask any teachers, instructors, or authority figures in the child’s life about their rules. A teacher may have a classroom rule where if a child is having a behavior issue, she will call their name as a warning. You should then remind the child that is an important rule that must be followed whenever she is in the classroom.

, It’s a good idea to always have a plan B option in your back pocket, especially if you know your child can be unpredictable or act out on occasion. If you have a certain activity planned and your child does not seem interested or engaged, make sure you have an alternate activity that you can try. This will keep you from feeling stressed and frustrated. Being flexible about your plans for your child can help you be more patient and understanding., If the child acts out in public, you may want to have your partner take the child outside or into a quiet space nearby. If you are alone with the child, you may take the child out yourself and sit with the child until she calms down. Always try to note quiet areas or spots when you are in public with the child, as you may need to access them in the event of an issue.You should also have a safe space in your house where you can leave the child alone to vent out her anger or issues. This could be her bedroom or a den that is full of objects that can help to calm her down. You may also put on soothing music or a soothing video that you know the child will respond well to.

, Doing self-care is an important part of being a good caretaker for a special needs child. Take a moment to focus on your needs, even if it is for a few minutes a day.Do a five minute meditation or enjoy your coffee for five minutes without interruption. Ask your partner to watch your child for an hour while you do something for you, such as going to a yoga class or taking a quiet walk. Taking a moment for yourself is key, as devoting all your energies toward your child can lead to feeling burned out and overly stressed.

, Treating a tense situation with humor and light heartedness can really help to bring your stress level down. This could be laughing or making a joke when your child does something strange or acts out in public. Humor can help to release stress and make you feel less frustrated with your child.


You could also turn the situation around by trying to make your child laugh. One parent noted that she uses ear plugs and a white noise machine on her child to help her calm down when she has a tantrum. But sometimes, the parent puts the ear plugs in her ears, which makes the child laugh and defuses a lot of the stress and tension between them."
"
Talk to other individuals who work with special needs children.,
Join a support group for parents of special needs children.,
Ask for help from professionals if needed.",How to Be Patient With a Child With Special Needs3," It can be helpful to talk to other parents, caretakers, instructors, or teachers who work with special needs children. Sharing your joys, fears, issues, and challenges with others who can empathize can help you feel less stressed and overworked.


You may have a parent who lives nearby that you can call and talk to or a special needs teacher who you can meet with for advice. Building a support network of individuals will make being patient and understanding with your special needs child that much easier, especially on challenging days.
If you do not yet have a support network of individuals, you may try to meet people at your child’s school, or other parents at your child’s recreational classes. There are also online forums you can join where you can talk to other parents and caretakers about any issues or problems you may be experiencing with your special needs child.

, Look for a support group that meets in your area. Support groups can be a very healthy way to deal with any issues or problems you may be experiencing with your child and allow you to connect with others who can understand where you are coming from., Though you may be determined to care for your special needs child alone, remember that it can be a challenging and difficult job. There is no shame in reaching out to professional doctors or therapists for assistance, especially if you are struggling with maintaining your patience around your child.Your primary care doctor can refer you to a therapist who is trained to work with special needs children as well as the parents of special needs children. You may need to commit to weekly or bi-monthly meetings where you discuss your issues and work on ways to cope with them.

"
Recognize that trust needs to be earned, especially if a child has been hurt before.You can't expect to be trusted if you don't make a habit of being trustworthy.,
Stay calm, consistent, and predictable.,
Be mindful of the noise you make, especially if the child is hypersensitive.,
Be honest and keep your word.,
Be fair.,
Make your emotions clear.,
Take a break if you're experiencing strong emotions.",How to Gain an Autistic Child's Trust2," Don't expect the child to immediately love you. Continue being trustworthy and persistent.Different children take different lengths of time to warm up to someone, so don't be surprised if it takes several days. Don't give up on them. Keep showing that you care.
Don't take it personally if the child doesn't trust you yet., Do your best to keep things pleasant and low-key. Shouting and mood swings can be frightening to an autistic child.Keep the rules consistent, and follow through each time.For example, it's confusing if sometimes you let them watch TV after 7 pm but other times you scold them.
Phrase demands as demands, not as requests.This can confuse the child, and make them think that they are not ever allowed to say no to requests.If you're making a request, phrase it like a request.

, Do your best to avoid making sudden or loud noises. If you need to do something loud, warn the child first. For example, ""I'm going to get some ice from the ice machine. You might want to cover your ears.""

, Autistic children focus on the literal meaning of your words, and this might be the only thing they can use to judge your intentions.Don't make promises you can't keep. If you aren't sure if you can do something, say ""I'll do my best to..."" or ""I want to..."" This keeps a level of uncertainty for unplanned contingencies, such as you getting too sick to visit or you being late due to a traffic jam.
If you say ""We're leaving in 5 minutes,"" that means literally five minutes. Get out your watch.

, Treat the autistic child with the same love and respect that you give their peers. Showing favoritism, or being strict with the autistic child and lenient with other children, may make the child feel rejected and they may no longer trust you.


Don't make the child follow rules that other kids can get away with breaking.Consider how much time you spend praising the child, and how much time you spend correcting or criticizing them. Are you supporting their self esteem, or only tearing them down?

, Autistic children may have difficulty reading tone of voice and body language, so they may struggle to figure out how you feel. It can help to verbalize how you're feeling.For example, ""I'm not mad at you, just frustrated about the delay. I know it's not your fault.""
Avoid sarcasm, as many autistic children don't understand it.
Match your body language and emotions. If there's a mismatch, explain how you really feel, so that they don't get confused.

, Autistic children can be easily frightened,and they might be afraid if they see an angry, scared, or frustrated adult. You can making the situation less scary by taking a break, and coming back when you are able to express yourself more calmly.


Tell the child what you're doing: ""I'm having a hard time right now, so I'm going to take a minute or two of quiet time to calm down. Then I'll come back.""

"
Show them how much you care about them.,
Presume competence.,
Respect their boundaries.,
Respect the child's desire not to interact sometimes.,
Be upfront about plans and facts.,
Engage their special interests.,
Listen closely.,
Be kind when they mess up.,
Embrace their individuality.,
Make good memories together.",How to Gain an Autistic Child's Trust3," You might know that you love the child, but that doesn't mean that the child knows it. Show your love for them in your words and actions.Use multiple ways to show love: words, actions, affection, spending time together, et cetera., Act with the assumption that the child is a good person who wants to do their best and make other people proud of them. This helps the child feel supported, and encourages them to rise to meet your expectations.


If a child is nonverbal and has no AAC, assume that they can hear and understand you, even if they don't look at you. Talk to them, and notice if they give a response in their body language. Nonverbal children can still be incredibly communicative, especially if you encourage them.

, Autistic children also need personal space, and need to be able to decline hugs, kisses, hand-holding, and other forms of touch. For example, instead of grabbing them and hugging them, ask if they want a hug, or spread your arms to signal an invitation to hug.


Some types of touch may be unpleasant or painful to an autistic child, especially if they are overwhelmed. If they seem unwilling to be touched right now, take that very seriously.
Give an alternate suggestion if you or someone else wants touch. For example, maybe the child can't handle hugs right now, but they can give high-fives or fist bumps. Ask if the child would like to do that instead. (Don't make it a big deal if they say no to that too.)

, The child won't always want to spend time with you, especially if they are overwhelmed or stressed. If so, let them have quiet time. They'll notice if you respect their boundaries, and will be more likely to trust you in the future.


Don't make the child play with children that they don't like.It's better to play alone than to play with fake friends or people who mistreat you when the adults turn their backs.

, Tell the child what is going to happen, and stick to your word. Don't make arrangements behind their back.If there is a sudden change of plans, be clear about it, and validate the child's feelings.


Avoid sugarcoating the truth. Instead, break it gently.
If there is something you absolutely cannot tell them, explain why.

, Autistic people love to talk about and do things related to their special interests. Ask about them, and show genuine interest. Their special interests can be a good topic for conversations, activities, and gifts.


If a girl loves cars, you could get out toy cars for her, so she can spin the wheels and line them up with you.
A boy who loves cooking might enjoy baking cookies with you.
A child who writes might love it if you ask them what they're working on.

, Put down your phone, stop worrying about other things, and don't focus on what you want the child to do. Instead, pay close attention to what the child is telling you (whether they're using spoken words, AAC, or behavior).


Work on validating their feelings more often.
Listen before you open your mouth. Avoid pressing your own agenda; instead, listen to the full story before speaking., Practice patience and understanding. Autistic children can be especially sensitive to criticism, so it's important to provide reassurance and clear direction instead of scolding.


Being gentle can reassure the child that they're allowed to make mistakes, and that messing up doesn't make them a bad person. Say this out loud if you think they're confused.

, Each child is different, and autistic children especially have many quirks. Embrace their uniqueness, including their autistic traits. After all, autism is a part of them.


Let the child make choices related to self-expression, such as wardrobe, bedroom decor, et cetera.
Don't demand that they hide their autism or pretend to be ""normal."" Let them do what works best for them.Assume that any stims or repetitive motions are important, even if you don't understand them., Keep being positive, encouraging the child, and doing fun things together.


Remind the child of fun things that happened. ""Remember when we went down to the lake and caught dragonflies?"" ""Remember the silly books we read last weekend? Would you like to read with me more today?""

Be aware of, and appreciate all the things that your parents do for you from day to day, month to month, year to year.,
Recognize and respect the fact that they have been through many more life experience than you, and can offer you a great deal of knowledge about the world you live in.,
It's a given that sometimes your parents may seem totally clueless and you may feel like they can't possibly relate to the things your dealing with currently, But believe what I say, they actually do understand some of the things that your going through like peer pressure, friendship issues, and a lot of other things that kids your age has to deal with simply because they were once a kid just like you.,
Remember that your parents love you more than anything else in the world, an have high expectations of what they want you to achieve because they believe in you and want to see you be at your best as you become an adult.,
When at times you feel that your parents don’t listen or don’t take you seriously, take a moment to think about what you want them to know and discuss your problems calmly with them and make sure you listen to their side of the story.,
Make a daily effort not to complain about having to obey your parents commands.,
Be helpful and assume responsibility around the house by doing extra chores when you can, just to show that you want to do your part in your everyday family life.,
Remember that new clothes, toys, cell phones, and money allowances are always nice, but be aware of your parents' income and how much they can afford to spend on the things that they buy for your enjoyment.,
Remember that one of the most important things you can do for your parents is to be a loving person.,
And last but not least...Everyday, take the opportunity to tell your parents you love them.

,
Talk to them regularly.,
Visit them often.,
Include your parents in your family activities.,
Help them maintain active lives.,
Organize visits with their grandchildren.,
Be loving.",How to Respect Parents," Notice the amount of time they dedicate to being with you, and the joy they express when spending family time with you. Imagine what it would be like to put yourself in their shoes. If you were your mom or your dad, how would you like to be treated by your own children? How would it feel to have to manage the many responsibilities they have in your household? What decisions would you make if you were in your parents’ position? Thank them for the big things they do, like staying up all night with you when you’re sick, as well as for the little things, like bringing you a cup of hot tea or helping you choose a dress for a special occasions.;
, Although sometimes parents may seem overly-strict or embarrassingly old-fashioned, for example; Insisting that you respect them as well as your other elders by referring to them as ""Sir"", or ""Madam"", you must respect the fact that often their guidance toward you reflects wisdom that has been passed down from their own parents and elders. This type of strict guidance is an essential part of their teachings to insure that your able to grow up to be a good, descent, productive and respectful adult.

, But ""NEVER"" be afraid of discussing problems that you are having with your parents. You have to tell them if you have issues, they can't help you with things they aren't aware of. It's their job as a parent to help you through things.

, Often, when they ask you to do things that seem ridiculous or totally unfair, it’s because they want what’s best for you, and they want to teach you a very important and valuable lesson, that... ""Sometimes in life things aren't always fair a big portion of the time"".

, Avoid arguments with them even if sometimes they seem unfair. Remember that above all, it's your parents that should make the final decision for you and that it's inappropriate for you to try to have the last word. A mature approach on your part includes having a calm and respectful attitude at the end of the conversation and accept that as they are your parents, their will must be your way. In time this will earn their trust in you, and it will demonstrate to them that you are well on your way to becoming a competent well rounded individual who will soon be capable of making your own good decisions, and be responsible for your actions. Don't talk back to your parents because when they are strict they are only trying to teach you responsibility and they only want the best for you.

, Your parents make a lot of sacrifices for you, so reward their efforts with gratitude, obedience and a positive respectful attitude. Remember that these ways that they are teaching you will be so very valuable to you when you grow older and become parents of your own children. You will be able to convey to your own kids the family values you were taught while growing up at home. Remember this, would you want your children behaving with you, the way you may be behaving at home now? Never forget to apologize if you've argued with them; remember that they have feelings, too.

, If you have younger siblings, help them with their homework and their chores, be a model of good behavior for them and try to encourage their obedience to you just as you are obedient to your parents. This will help build a strong and loving family structure for your whole family.

, If at all possible, help them out. Earn some money of your own and save it to help pay for a portion of your clothing and entertainment.

, Parents by nature need to know and feel that their children have a great love for them. Be affectionate and give them just as many hugs and kisses as they give you, and do it as often as you wish. There never need be a special occasion reserved for doing this. Love costs nothing, and you can and should want to give it freely. It's what all parents hope and wish for from their beloved children, and I promise you this, the warm feeling you get in your heart for such acts as these last a lifetime.

,, Your parents can be the best friends you’ll ever have. They have rich lives and their years of stories are invaluable treasures.

, Even if you don't live near them. You’ll be grateful for the time you spent with them when they're gone, and you’ll regret the lost opportunity if you don’t visit them.

, Invite them to movies, family dinners and on family vacation.

, If your parents are elderly and have a hard time driving or getting around, take them to see their friends, to go shopping, to restaurants and out for walks.

, If you have children, let them visit your parents as often as possible. A loving relationship between grandparents and grandchildren is one of the joys of life (not to mention free babysitting!).

, Just like you were when you were a kid!


Be affectionate and give them hugs and kisses (they still love it!).
Apologize if you've argued with them; remember that they have feelings, too.
Thank them for helping to make you the wonderful person you've become.
Now that you have income, spoil them the way they spoiled you. Bring them small gifts like flowers, chocolates or a book you think they might enjoy. Give them big gifts on their birthdays and important holidays.
Everyday, take the opportunity to tell your parents you love them.

Make them a priority.,
Give compliments.,
Adopt a good attitude.,
Focus on your partner’s positives.,
Be honest.,
Forgive.",How to Respect Each Other at Home1," Part of respecting someone is making them a priority in your life. Deciding that they aren’t good enough to devote much of your time to makes them seem like they are an afterthought. It also sends the message that you don’t respect them enough to make them a big part of your life. This can be devastating to your partner.


Look your partner in the eye when they are talking to you, put down your phone or any other distractions when you are spending time together, and set aside time each week—or even each day—for alone time. A person’s time is invaluable. Giving it to someone is a huge sign of respect.;
, Your partner needs to hear what you love about them, even if you’ve been together forever. Don’t assume they already know how you feel. Offering praise can bring you closer together and can strengthen your level of respect for each other.


Complimenting your partner on what they do around the home shows you respect the sacrifice and the hard work they give you and the life you’ve built together. For example, ""I really appreciate how you keep our family room clean and organized."" Hearing these words of encouragement shows them you appreciate what they do.
Demonstrate respect and appreciation by complimenting your partner on positive traits, too. These may include acts of thoughtfulness or even physical traits like their smile.For example, ""I really like how you greet me with a smile when I come home.""

, You are likely polite to your parents, friends, and boss because you respect them. You probably wouldn’t think about giving them attitude or criticism. Adopt this same mentality for your partner. Choosing to be kind, gracious, and polite shows you respect them, which can make a world of difference in your relationship.


Make it a point to be happy and encouraging around them, even if they aren’t doing the same. Tell them you love them and how happy they make you. They will likely exhibit the same behavior towards you, which can strengthen your bond., It’s easy to concentrate on what your partner does wrong, particularly if you feel they are lacking in a few areas. Instead, try focusing on what your partner does right or is good at. Hearing positive words instead of negative will encourage them to keep up the good work and shows that you value them.


Look for the best in your partner and realize that they are imperfect, just like you. Speak to them the way you would like to be spoken to and you may see an improvement in your relationship.For example, ""Thanks for listening while I talked about my work stress.""

, Honesty is at the foundation of a positive, healthy relationship. Being honest strengthens your bond with your partner and shows that you are trustworthy. Tell the truth to your partner, even when it's painful to hear.


Inspire honesty in your relationship by having your actions match your words. For instance, don't say ""I'm happy"" if you're not. Demonstrate honesty by truly divulging your feelings. You might say, ""To be honest, I'm a bit sad that we won't get to spend our anniversary together.""
When you exhibit honesty, your partner will feel obliged to do the same., When you love someone, you have to be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. This may mean forgiving them and expecting them to do the right thing, even after they have hurt you. Holding grudges can create a toxic relationship environment. Practice forgiveness with your partner and you both will benefit from a more positive bond.


The biggest part of forgiveness is being able to let go of the painful emotions that may be associated with the betrayal. Forgiveness comes easier when you employ empathy in your viewpoint of your partner.
Take a step back and try to view the situation from your partner's point-of-view. Can you see some rationale behind their behavior? Maybe they were ashamed or scared to tell the truth. Doing this doesn't excuse the negative behavior, but it does help you see your partner as human and capable of mistakes.Work on not continually bringing up the same issue--even if it is still not corrected. In the meantime, continue to be kind and complimentary in other areas.

Reorganize your schedule.,
Schedule time to spend with your adult children.,
Don’t make excuses.,
Create new rituals.",How to Spend More Time with Your Adult Children1," One way to find more time for your adult children is to delegate or reschedule tasks that you don’t absolutely need to do. For instance, let dusting the house wait until tomorrow so that you can head out to the theatre with your adult children. Or ask your coworker to swap assignments with you so that you can sneak out of the house to grab dinner with your adult children., One of the main reasons that families don’t spend time together is that they simply don’t make a point of getting together.Include spending time with your adult children on your planner or calendar, just as you would with any other appointment or meeting.Just call your adult child up and ask, “How would you like to get lunch on Sunday?” If they are not free Sunday, propose the following weekend or ask, “What is a day that works for you?”
Remember, everyone is busy, but you only have one life. You might regret not spending more time with your adult children if you don’t take time to do so.

, There are many reasons you might appeal to in order to justify not spending time with your adult children. Some of these reasons might even be premised on your own consideration of their time and well-being. For instance, you might think, “My kid’s busy with their own family/life, so they don’t have time to see me.” However, if you continually allow your thinking and habits to be swayed by excuses, you will end up never spending time with your adult children., In addition to random lunches or get-togethers with your adult children, set up some regular occasions when you can get together with them and their families. For instance, perhaps you and your adult children gather every Sunday, or during every first Sunday of the month to play board games or go for a bike ride."
"
Meet with your parent(s).,
Go with realistic expectations.,
Remember that you cannot change anything about your parent - you can only be responsible for your own attitudes and behaviors.,
Forgive them.,
Ask for forgiveness if appropriate.,
Continue at the pace you are comfortable with.,
Insist upon consistency from this point on.,
Live free.",How to Reconcile With a Rehabilitated Abusive Parent," Let's say one parent treated you badly, while the other passively allowed the abuse. You have spent years being angry and hurt when you get a call asking for reconciliation. You must now critically assess whether or not your parent has reformed enough to suit you. Arrange to meet with them, preferably in a neutral location such as a park or a restaurant.;
, It's probably unrealistic to assume your parent will want to grovel on his or her belly and beg your forgiveness, but talking is the first step. If your parent does grovel, it's harder to be objective, but you must.

, If you feel the meeting reveals dis-ingenuousness on the part of one or both parents, say so and leave. If you have any doubt about the sincerity of what is said, it is on your shoulders to gather your dignity (now that you've earned some by being your own person) and tell your parents that you will be glad to try again at whatever point they are serious about reforming.

, If you have listened to your parent(s) and come to the conclusion that enough rehabilitation has taken place that you are now willing to resume a relationship with them, then allow yourself to forgive. Yes, your parent may have abused you. However, that is no excuse not to forgive them and accept that whilst they may have hurt you, you shouldn't hurt them. Remember that this is about restoring your family relationship and requiring your parents to treat you with the respect you deserve as an adult. Demonstrating maturity by forgiving your parent's past behavior is a big step in that direction, as well as in freeing yourself from the shackles of past pain.

, If you were partly to blame, ask for forgiveness. But - don't apologize if you did nothing you are sorry for. Accept any apology you are sincerely offered, but don't feel a need to reciprocate with an apology of your own unless it is actually warranted. This article is simply encouraging you to purge yourself of all negative aspects of the relationship's past.

, Any attempts to pressure you should be met with your firm resistance. Your folks may want to take an attitude of ""okay, it's all in the past - let's let bygones be bygones,"" which basically requires you to pretend that nothing ever happened. Or they may push or take exception to any boundaries you put in place. Don't allow it. You were the injured party, and rehabilitation does not erase the past, it only repairs it to some degree. Forgiveness does not require you to forget all that happens, nor should it be thought of as passive acquittal. If your parents want to come spend a week with you, suggest a nearby hotel, and let them know that you may not be available every day of their visit. If they want you to come and stay, obviously, do not stay at their house; that would reinforce old, negative feelings. Keep a little distance, at least for awhile, until you are completely comfortable, in your own time.

, Do not accept any recidivism or falling back into old patterns. If it starts to happen, remind your parent that you will no longer tolerate being spoken to or treated in that manner, and they must stop. If the behavior continues, walk away. If it happens at a second meeting, warn your parents that falling back into your old relationship will cause you to leave permanently. If after you have warned your folks in this way, it still happens, you may have to consider the possibility that any reconciliation will have to be from a distance.

, Assuming your parent was sincere, and rehabilitation worked and lasts, you can breathe free air and rejoice in your repaired relationship. Don't revisit the past if arguments occur - let the past remain buried. Bringing up old hurts at the first disagreement or conflict will undermine the progress you have made. You will need to establish many years' worth of memories in your new roles as adult and parents, rather than falling back into the role of victim and abusers before these memories and feelings outweigh the old. Try hard to avoid situations that may provoke problems - in other words, don't push when you know you're pushing a potential button. Keep things cool.

Start by making a chart.,
Talk with your kids.,
Check to see if there is a Parental Control option on your television.,
Act as the administrator and make sure your children are following the rules.",How to Set Television Rules for Your Kids," Set a predetermined amount of time for your children to watch television each day, and enforce the rule. No more than 2-4 hours is a good idea. Post the chart in a place where your children can see it (e.g. the kitchen fridge, bedroom door, etc.);
, Make sure they understand that you are serious about these guidelines, and enforce that if they are caught watching television when not permitted, or banned, they can expect punishments.

, This way, you can block certain channels while allowing full or limited access to others, most likely news, science, or kid-friendly. If such an option does not exist, however, write down a list of what channels they are permitted to view, and when.


When they're caught viewing dangerous / unapproved channels, follow through with punishments (grounding, timeouts, cancellation of privileges, extra chores, etc.)

, Check in with them every so often to ensure that they are watching the programs you have allowed them access to.

Find out what they like to do as ""fun"".,
Go with them when they do the activities they enjoy.,
Ask them to teach you something new.,
Teach them something you learned of value.,
Inspire creativity.,
Eat a meal together.,
Create a challenge.,
Share stories.",How to Spend Quality Time With a Teen," Now this does not mean you have to start skateboarding just because it might be one of their top ""fun"" things to do. There are many other fun things they probably like to do. For example, bike riding, playing games on the computer or XBox. Try to play games you both can do. There are also teens who are not into sports but are into other things like cooking, drawing, or even sewing.;
, While obviously, your teen won't want you tagging along when they are having fun, you can create some great memories by going with them to see how good they are at something (or at least having fun).

, Asking them to teach you how to do something new like learning how to play with the Wii (if you have one) or even learning a new recipe. Learning something new from someone younger can improve skills and score you cool points with your friends and sometimes even with your teen's friends.

, It's not about how to do accounting or start a business. Try teaching them how to fish, swim, drive a car, play a game that you grew up playing, or even how to fry an egg. It could trigger something that you both can enjoy doing together.

, Sometimes it just takes a spark of creativity to get someone going. If you both cannot find something to do, Invent it! For example, you both might like to play games, but one might like to play soccer and the other football. Put them both together, or make new rules and call it ""Fugibal"" (Way to play that is no feet with a soccer ball and hands off if with football)

, Nothing brings people together like a nice meal. You don't have to go all out! Sometimes just pizza and something to drink will do. Talk about each other's day. But do not bring in work related problems in. Talk about the weather, some ad you might have seen on the way home, something in the news either one of you saw, how the economy is functioning, or just how you both are feeling at the moment.

, Sometimes creating a challenge between both the teen and you can cause you both to have quality time every day. For example, both of you might be slightly over weight (guessing the teen a little more than the adult), one might be able to challenge the other to loose 2 lbs per 1 lb one might loose. In the end who ever wins gets a prize (or just satisfaction they beat the other person).

, Sharing stories give your teen an inside look at how you were raised and sometimes can even change their opinion about you. Also, them sharing a story about something happening to them or a memory that they remembered can also help both of you enjoy your time together.

Believe them if they say something is wrong.,
Be patient and respectful about unusual speech.,
Protect them, even if it looks different from how you'd protect a non-autistic child.,
Be patient and understanding.,
Sit with them or disengage if you don't know what to do.,
Apologize if you mess up.",How to Gain an Autistic Child's Trust4," An autistic child might have a different perception of the world: a light is too bright, a big party is scary and not fun, the sound of Dad unloading the dishwasher must be what hell is like. If they say that something is upsetting, believe them.If children's fears are minimized or ignored, they stop trusting their caregivers to protect them from harmful things.Don't say ""it's not a big deal"" or ""it's easy."" Instead, acknowledge that it's difficult and help the child deal with it., It's okay to ask for clarification, or admit that you don't understand. Tell them that you care about what they're saying, and are having a hard time understanding.Ask them to repeat it more slowly, write it down, use AAC, et cetera so that you can understand.


Sometimes, an autistic person will repeat a phrase because they are trying to tell you something, but don't know how to phrase it. Ask questions to help figure out what they mean.Odd phrasing often means they're struggling to find words. Ask questions to help figure out what they are really trying to say.If you smile and nod, the child can usually tell that you aren't truly listening.

, This might mean stopping Auntie when she wants to plant a wet kiss on the autistic child's cheek, or taking the child away from a noisy room.If they find something unpleasant, believe them, and show that you care by helping protect them from it.

, When interacting with each other, the two of you might experience problems like miscommunication or disagreement. If you stay friendly and caring towards the child, they'll be more likely to trust you in the difficult moments.

, If a child is having a crisis, and you aren't sure how to respond, don't try to guess what to do.


Ask someone who knows the child better if you don't know how to do something. It's okay to get help if you're uncertain.
Never forcefully grab or pin down a panicked child. It will only make them even more panicked, and they may hit or kick you in an attempt to free themselves.

, If you upset the child or mishandle a situation, say that you're sorry and you didn't mean it. This reassures the child that you still care about and respect them.

Get married, if you already aren't or find a long-term partner.,
Have children with your partner.,
Buy vegan foods.,
Study veganism online.,
Vegan-raised children often learn to enjoy vegetables that other children will avoid.,
Raise your family this way!",How to Raise a Vegan Family," Talk to your partner about veganism in the family you will raise together. If they are already vegan, they will be very receptive! If they are not vegan, the discussion may take some time and be ongoing.;
, After you have a child (or children), eat plenty of wholefoods such as vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts and seeds, beans, lentils, and soy products, and supplement with plant-based oils and B-12 as necessary. (Remember that human breastmilk is vegan and essential to a growing infant during the first 1 or 2 years at least.) They will grow to love these healthy dishes and will love their healthy vegan lifestyle later on. Once your child(ren) are around 5 or 6, talk to them more about why you are only eating plant-based foods. Tell them that you are doing good for Earth's animals, because, before consumption, they are killed in slaughterhouses, and the meat products and byproducts are packed up and put in trucks, and the drivers take them to the grocery store, where they will be bought, cooked, and eaten. Discuss animal cruelty briefly, and how animals feel pain just like we do, and that is why you are a vegan family.

, Just a few healthy and earth-friendly choices are: lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, apples, watermelon, nuts, cabbage, eggplant, blueberries, pears, coconuts, bananas, potatoes, jalapeño peppers, habenero peppers, snow peas, pea pods, and packaged salads. Many more options are available at you local grocery store! All of these benefit your health. Remember children need more fat in their diet, so include plenty of coconuts, avocado, tofu, nuts and seeds. Refer to guides written about raising vegan children written by vegan dieticians for the best, more informed advice.

, Veganism is lifestyle that includes foods and other products - such as clothing and cosmetics - that are from plants or have been made from plant-based or synthetic materials. The foods you eat are good for you because you aren't eating a lot of saturated fats, cholesterol, hormones, contaminants like antibiotics in animal feed, and refined oils. Some drinks have animal products, like dairy milk from cows and goats. You cannot drink animal milk or cheese on your vegan diet, but there are plenty of similar products available made from soy, nuts, seeds, and other plants. You can find these online stores or in organic specialty stores and some major chain stores.

, Some of these are broccoli, asparagus, artichoke, spinach, Brussels sprouts, garlic, celery, and onions. Experiment with different ways of preparation to make these more palatable. Invest in a few vegan cookbooks specializing in recipes for children or look them up online. There are quite a lot of vegan parenting blogs that include recipes.

, You can then help your children live to be healthy! Congratulations!

Allow them to help themselves.,
Validate their feelings and opinions.,
Model the behavior you want to see.,
Avoid speaking for them.,
Correct behavior calmly and consistently.",How to Respect Each Other at Home2," Let your child complete tasks for themselves. You show them you don’t think they are capable of doing it themselves when you step in. Letting them accomplish things on their own shows you believe in and respect them.


Choose age-appropriate tasks for your children to complete on their own. For instance, picking out their own clothes, dressing themselves, and brushing their teeth are good options for younger children. Allow older children to make their own food, complete job applications, and drive themselves, if they are capable., Children come up with and express a variety of different emotions. You may not agree with some of them. You should still show that you accept they have these feelings and thoughts and not shut them down.


Tell them you understand what they are saying to you. For instance, you could say, “Not being able to go to the movies when your friends are is upsetting, isn’t it? I’m sorry you are feeling this way.” Here, you’re validating what they feel, but you’re not giving in to your decision. You’re showing them you respect what they say, even if you don’t agree with it., Show your children the kind of respect you want them to show you. They may not know or understand what showing respect looks like. Displaying it towards them and those around you demonstrates how you want them to behave.


For example, speaking kindly and being polite is an excellent way to show respect. Not constantly criticizing them and giving compliments also shows that you respect them. They will likely display this type of behavior after seeing you give it to them., Adults often talk over children's heads like they're not even there. This can come off as disrespectful, particularly when questions are being asked. Allow your child to answer their own questions and speak up during a conversation. Speaking for them shows that you don’t trust that they know what they’re talking about.


If someone asks you a question about your child say, “Ask them. They would know better than I do.” Your child will likely feel proud that they are given the chance to answer for themselves. It also shows that you believe they are capable of doing that., Kids need structure and discipline to understand appropriate behavior. However, yelling or having an outburst when they act up, doesn't support positive behavioral traits. To create a sense of respect and rule-following, make it your business to be compassionate yet consistent when correcting misconduct.


Instead of lecturing or getting angry, find a reasonable response to kids' whining or complaining like ""That's the rule."" If you must, validate their feelings with something like, ""I know you were hoping to eat dinner in front of the TV to watch the show, but we'll have dinner at the table like always. That's the rule.""
If your kids are attention-seeking with bad behavior, don't offer a reaction. Instead, praise positive behaviors. For instance, if you see them sharing, you might say, ""Oh, that makes me so happy to see you two sharing your toys. Great manners!"""

Keep things clean.,
Designate a time for quiet.,
Give them their privacy.,
Pay your bills.",How to Respect Each Other at Home3," Not keeping common areas and your own space clean is usually a big problem among roommates. Not only is it disrespectful, but it shows your roommate you expect them to clean up after you. This is often a huge cause of conflict among people who live together.


Always clean up after yourself when you use the bathroom, including toothpaste and hair in the sink. Additionally, tidy up the kitchen after you cook and eat. Pick up any messes you make, and vacuum and dust often. Showing respect in this way can make your living situation that much more pleasant., Having loud guests over late shows your roommate you don’t care about their need for sleep. Avoid this issue by setting ground rules about this when you first move in together. Abide by them once they are established.


Don’t be afraid to confront your roommate if they aren’t respecting quiet time. You could say, “I’m not trying to get in the way of you spending time with your friends, but they are staying later than what we agreed on. Would you mind having them leave by the time we discussed?”
You may need to renegotiate the conditions—and your living situation—if your roommate doesn’t comply., You likely don’t want your roommate to barge into your room and use your things, so don’t do that to them. Ask before entering their space or before you borrow something. Invading your roommate's privacy is extremely disrespectful.


Put a lock on your room if you don’t trust your roommate. Although doing so shows your roommate that you don’t trust them, it’s better than having your privacy invaded. It also prevents you from having to confront your roommate about stealing, which can make your living situation extremely awkward., Come up with a plan for how you are going to pay the bills. You may suggest splitting everything down the middle or having each person responsible for certain bills. Then, pay your bills on time. Making your roommate wait for your money is disrespectful."

Discuss with your adult children what you would like to do.,
Get together for holidays or other special occasions.,
Ask your adult children to accompany you on errands.,
Cook dinner together.,
Walk your pets together.,
Watch TV or movies together.,
Attend a public lecture.,
Volunteer at charitable institutions.,
Go on vacations together.,
Exercise with your adult children.",How to Spend More Time with Your Adult Children2," Take some time getting to know what your adult children are interested in doing. You could ask, for instance, “What would you like to do?” Listen attentively. Then, based on their feedback and suggestions, develop a game plan that ensures fun for you, your adult children, your partner, and other relevant parties (for instance, the partner of your adult children, your grandchildren, and so on). If discussing what your adult children would like to do in person, use positive body language like maintaining eye contact and nodding to show you are listening.

, Many people find that holidays are a great time to spend with their adult children and other family members. Identify the major holidays in your nation and offer your adult children the chance to celebrate one or more of them with you. For instance, if you live in Canada, you might choose to call your adult children prior to Christmas and invite them to share a pleasant home-cooked meal together., Even the most mundane activities or outings can be an opportunity to spend more time with your adult children. For instance, if you’re headed to the store (and especially if the store is near your adult child’s residence), you might ask your adult child, “I’m heading to the grocer’s. Would you like to accompany me?”In a variation of this, you could ask your adult children to help you around the house. For instance, if you are moving out of your house, you could ask your adult children to come over and box up your possessions.
This might provide you and your adult children an opportunity to bond over the house they grew up in, or to rediscover some artifact of their past (an old photo or beloved toy) that could make you and your adult child remember how special your family is.

, Host a large dinner party with your adult children. Cooking with your adult children can be great fun. For the ultimate adventure, choose a dish that neither you nor your children have ever made before. That way, you’re all learning together.Make a big batch so you all have some leftovers you can take home for the next few nights.

, If both you and your adult children have dogs, you could introduce them to each other for playdates and walks. This way, your dogs could meet new friends and you could spend more time with your adult children.When you first introduce your dogs to each other, keep them on their leashes. Let them see and sniff each other from a distance for a few minutes at first.
Some degree of roughhousing is expected, but if they start growling at each other, baring their teeth, and lowering their heads, you should separate them and try introducing them to each other another day.

, If you and your adult children have a show you’re both interested in, or if you and your adult children are both interested in seeing a certain movie, you can use your shared interest to spend time together. Have a movie or show night. After the show or movie, you can talk about your favorite scene or discuss your different interpretations of the story or characters., If you and your adult children live near a museum or university, you can probably catch a lecture on an important and interesting subject for free. Check the events calendar of your local university or public institution for free lectures on a variety of subjects, and choose one that you and your adult children are both interested in., If you have a soup kitchen or food bank nearby, they probably have unmet volunteer needs. You and your adult children might, for instance, be tasked with boxing food or picking up goods that will later be redistributed to those in need. Ask your adult children if they’d be interested in giving back to their community with you. If they are, contact the organization you’re interested in volunteering for and schedule time to volunteer.Volunteering for a charitable organization is not only a great way to spend more time with your adult children, but it is a good way to help those in need, too.

, Invite your adult children to head to the beach or mountains with you. You and your adult children can enjoy time away from the hectic pace of work to catch up with each other.If your adult children have significant others, be sure to invite them, too.
Float a few vacation destination options by your adult children. Talk to them about what sort of vacation they’d like, then decide together where you’d like to go as a family.

, You and your adult children could go on walks or bike rides at your local park. This will not only keep both of you hale and hearty, but it will also provide a great opportunity to catch up with one another about what’s going on in your lives and what sorts of "

Be respectful of your adult child’s boundaries.,
Support your child emotionally.,
Don’t continuously push unsolicited advice.,
Ask your adult children what their preferred mode of communication is.",How to Spend More Time with Your Adult Children3," This means respecting the privacy and decisions of your adult child. For instance, even if your child was always present for holidays when they were growing up, they might be less inclined to come home for the holidays as adults, especially if they have their own families to attend to, or if they live far away now.Additionally, do not drop by unannounced if your child does not invite you over to their residence. Not only do you risk wasting your time if they are not home, but you also risk souring their mood if they feel put-upon and inconvenienced by your coming over.
When visiting your child’s residence, do not treat their house as an extension of your house. Obey their rules. For instance, if you do not take your shoes off when entering your house but your child does ask guests to take their shoes off in their house, conform to your child’s rules and take your shoes off when visiting.
If your child still lives with you as an adult, permit them some extra space. For instance, knock before you enter their room.

, Let your adult child know that you will be there for them when they need you. Listen to what they’re going through and offer empathy and understanding. For instance, if your adult child is having a hard time with a relationship, say, “Wow, that sounds like a difficult situation” or “I hope you can work it out.”Providing emotional support primarily requires listening, not problem-solving. Offer advice or material aid only when asked to do so.

, For instance, if your child does not pursue a PhD even though you really want them to, do not continually bring it up or needle them to obtain a PhD. You might see comments like, “You should really get a PhD” or “You might be able to get a better job with a PhD” as helpful suggestions, but your adult child might see them as pestering or nagging. If your adult child says they are not interested in acting on your unsolicited advice, accept their decision., If you contact your children via their preferred mode of communication, they are more likely to respond and reply to you. This might require changing your preferred mode of communication, but if you can make it easier for them to respond to you, you might be able to spend more time with them."

Explore family nudity without feeling it's abnormal.,
Keep nudity natural.,
Start early.,
Celebrate the differences.,
Avoid sexual expressiveness.",How to Practice Nudity in Your Family," Young children have not yet acquired a sophisticated understanding of modesty, and really don't care who sees them naked.

This is the time when the parent can teach children not to be self-conscious of their bodies or of their nakedness. This, in turn, will help children associate nakedness to routine activity instead of exclusively sexual activity. As a result, the more prurient forms of nakedness lose their ""forbidden fruit"" appeal.;
, Allow your children—from birth—to see you in ordinary nude situations, as you feel comfortable. Dressing and bathing are everyday activities where nudity is either part of the process (dressing) or required (bathing).

Toilet activities, while natural, are not something everybody is comfortable with sharing. Be true to your own personal restrictions—don't ever feel like you have to do something you're not comfortable doing.
On the flip side, nude cooking is not recommended for anybody, regardless of comfort level! There are places where hot oil simply doesn't belong.
By being comfortable with your own body you will naturally convey the message to your children that nudity really is okay and not something to fear or be grossed out about. There are naturally times in life when clothes must be worn for protection, for comfort, and to adhere to societal norms. However, by talking with your children about being comfortable with nudity at home, your children will grow up understanding that being nude and being seen nude at home isn't something ""uncool, horrible, and utterly embarrassing.""

, Encourage family nudity right from birth. You'd be surprised how quickly potty training takes root when your toddler is allowed to go bare at home.

Be prepared for occasional ""accidents,"" and handle these situations calmly without anger.

, As children begin to recognize differences between themselves, you, and your partner, explain to them the reason for these differences.

Suggested explanations are: ""Mommy's breasts are for giving milk to babies like when you were small.""
Another subject that may crop up is pubic hair: ""Mommy and Daddy have hair down here because our bodies are warmer, and it helps keep our bodies cooler.""
If the subject of sexual organs comes up (and it will), simply be honest and straightforward. ""Mommy has a vagina, and daddy has a penis."" Avoid using either silly or vulgar terms—they will be the words your children use when the subject comes up at school. And it will come up.

, Like bathroom time, sexuality is perfectly natural and normal. However, sexual displays are not for children of any age. It will likely confuse them at best, and traumatize them at worst."

Consider enlisting professional help.",How to Record Family Stories," Capturing good audio in your recording is crucial. Use a decent-quality digital recorder, a peripheral mic connected to your computer, or a recording app on your smartphone and follow the directions below:


Position the mic as close to the storyteller as possible. If you're participating and you only have one mic, put it between you. Be sure to speak into the mic.
Pick an indoor spot that's as quiet as possible. Background noises like airplanes and construction sounds get picked up by mics easily.
Avoid places with lots of bare, hard surfaces like empty rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, and so on. These places can give your recording a noticeable echo. Soft furniture, rugs, blankets, and wall coverings can help.;
, Video recordings of family stories present their own challenges. Use these tips to ensure your recording looks as good as possible:


Keep the storyteller's face and upper body centered in the frame. You don't have to shoot head-on — slight angles are fine.
Use a tripod or prop your camera on something sturdy to keep the frame still.
Shoot somewhere with soft, even lighting. Avoid harsh fluorescent lights and the outdoors.
Consider putting a gentle light in front of the storyteller to completely eliminate shadows.

, Nothing's worse than making an hour-long recording only to discover that something didn't work. To avoid this, take 10 seconds to test your recording devices.


If the storyteller's voice is too loud, move the mic away or reduce its recording volume. If the storyteller's voice is too quiet, move the mic closer or turn up its recording volume.If you're picking up background noise, move to a different spot or turn off whatever is making the noise.
If the storyteller's face has distracting shadows or is being lit too harshly in a video recording, adjust your lighting or find a different spot.

, It's often best to get stories from the people who experienced them firsthand. These people tend to have the most reputable version of events because none of their story has been affected by hearsay or secondhand accounts. Exceptions to this rule exist, so use your own judgment; only you know your family.

, Most family members will be willing to cooperate so you can get a good recording. However, children and the elderly can sometimes be hard to work with. Make the recording process as smooth as possible by ensuring everyone is comfortable before you start. See below:


Make sure the storyteller understands that s/he is being recorded and consents to this.
Offer the storyteller a rough time limit for the recording so s/he knows when it will be over.
Ask the storyteller if s/he would like a drink or snack before you begin.
Make sure the storyteller has a comfortable place to sit or stand. Offer a pillow or blanket if needed.
Offer to take breaks if the story is a long one.

, It's perfectly acceptable to say something like, ""Tell us about the war, Grandpa"" to get the ball rolling. To keep the interview going, try asking lots of open-ended questions rather than factual or descriptive ones. These allow the storyteller to explore his or her thoughts and even come to illuminating new conclusions. Below are just a few example questions:


""How did that make you feel?""
""What were you thinking at the time?""
""What was your relationship with this person like?""
""What are your thoughts on how things stand now?""

, One simple option for recording family stories is to use a digital audio recorder. These portable devices allow you to capture audio files and transfer them to a computer. Best of all, they work roughly like tape recorders, making them easier for older members of your family to use.

, Many different apps allow quick, easy recording of family stories on the go. Just a few recommendations are below:


Story-recording apps like StoryCorps. This app comes with built-in recording functionality (using your device's mic) for up to 45-minute recordings and a ""question-maker"" option that can suggest interview questions (or help you figure out your own).Other digital services like StoryWorth and FamilySearch Memories offer comparable experiences.Simple voice-recording apps like Smart Voice Recorder (available on Android) usually offer streamlined options for recording, sharing, and saving audio.

, All you need is a cheap peripheral mic to turn your computer into an impromptu recording device. Most modern computers come with some form of audio-recording utility installed. If you don't have this software, you can also try downloading a free recording program (like Audacity).

, Video recordings are slightly less convenient to capture than audio recordings, but there's nothing like being able to see a family storyteller in action. Future generations are likely to appreciate having a visual component to the story.


The easiest video option is to point a cheap digital camcorder at the storyteller and simply hit ""record."" Most modern camcorders offer at least a few hours of storage space.
For short stories, a smartphone will often suffice. Nearly all modern smartphones come with the ability to capture video. However, many lack the storage space and image quality for anything other than a few short clips.

, If all else fails, you can always type or write down a family member's story as it is told. This is the most labor-intensive option, but having a written record of the story is usually better than simply trying to remember it and record it later.


It can be tough to capture an entire story in your notes while someone is speaking it. Try this: as your family member tells the story, take only broad, cursory notes — enough to make a rough outline. When s/he is done, try to tell the story yourself using your notes as a reference. Fill in any details you left out the first time and note any corrections your family member makes.

, Scrapbooks are a great way to save important family memories for decades. One idea is to try filling your scrapbook with old pictures of the people in the stories. You can also include documents like newspaper clippings, diplomas, certificates, and so on — anything that goes with the story.


See our scrapbooking article for lots of ideas.

, Any family story is better if you can see the people in it in action. Restoring old home videos and compiling them on a DVD with your recorded family stories makes a great present for a grandparent. You can also try setting your family stories to a slideshow of old photos if you don't have home videos you can use.


Many locations that develop photos can perform these services for you if you can provide the raw footage. For example, Costco Photo Centers can compile footage from VHS and film reels on a DVD for under $20., Once you have a few family stories recorded, store them together so that they can be shared and passed down through the generations. You may want to consider making copies of the recordings and giving them to multiple members of your family. As you record more stories, add them to your archive for safekeeping.


Today, cloud storage services offer a convenient way to store your family's memories. Cloud drives like Google Drive, Apple iCloud, and others let you store several gigabytes of information for free.

, Written accounts of family history can be major undertakings, but they're prized for a reason. There's nothing quite like having a book of your family's entire story in your hands. Knowing that all there is to know about your family is contained in a single tome is a remarkably satisfying feeling.


See our memoir-writing guide to get started.

Self-publishing is probably the most convenient option if the book is just for yourself and your family members.

, Looking for a unique way to preserve your family's stories? Using a professional's services will get your family a high-quality recording that's sure to stand the test of time. Some non-profits even do this for free.


StoryCorps (the maker of the app mentioned above) operates three permanent recording studios: one in Atlanta, one in Chicago, and one in San Francisco. In addition, one mobile studio regularly tours the country. Click here to make a free appointment online.Other companies like Life History Services offer the ability to pay for professional-quality recordings and other products.Another option is to pay for time at a recording studio in your local area. The advantage of this is that a sound engineer will be able to ensure you get a good-quality recording. Hourly rates can vary by location and services provided.

be at least 10 years older than the child or meet the family requirements (be a stepparent, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, or first cousin of the child which the court is satisfied with);
treat the adoptive child as if it were his or her own;
provide support for the child and will care for the child;
maintain a suitable residence for the child; and
agree to the adoption. ;
, There are several different types of adoption that are recognized in California. Of these options, find which is applicable or the best for you. When proceeding with one of the first three of these types, the parental rights of both birth parents are terminated and the adoptive parents become the legal parents:


Independent adoption: an adoption where the legal rights are transferred directly from the birth parents to the adoptive parents without involving a third party in the process. The once well-known Independent Adoption Center (IAC) has closed, but independent adoption itself still exists as an option in California.
Agency adoption: an adoption through the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) or a licensed adoption agency.
International adoption: the adoption of a child born in another country.
Stepparent/domestic partner: an adoption in which the legal partner of one birth parent gains legal rights over the child and only one birth parent’s rights are terminated. In this type of adoption, the couple that will become the legal parents must be married or legally registered domestic partners. Interstate adoption: the adoption of a child from another state. This will require your lawyer to be familiar with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), a uniform law for all states that sets the procedures for the transfer of children from one state to another. Adoption laws, for the most part, are controlled by the state laws. ICPC enables you to get through all those laws easily to adopt a child from a different state, with different adoption laws.

, To arrange an adoption through the CDSS visit their website or call 1-800-KIDS-4-US. The CDSS also has a directory of licensed adoption agencies available on its website Independent adoptions are based on personal knowledge and identification of the involved parties.

, Different agencies or parties involved in the adoption will have different requirements for beginning and completing the requirements. At a minimum, by California law, each potential adoptive parent must submit fingerprints, a criminal record, and participate in a home study, which is an investigation of the physical premises where the child will reside. Additionally, fees will vary depending on the type of adoption that is chosen. An adoption through CDSS or a public adoption agency will charge no more than $500 in addition to court costs and the costs for fingerprinting and obtaining background records, which is estimated to cost between $100 and $300. In some circumstances, these fees may be waived or reduced. , For each child being adopted, fill out ADOPT-200 Adoption Request form. This form includes the basic contact information of the adoptive parent, the basic details of the adoption, what type of adoption it is, basic information about the child, and whether the legal requirements are met. , The ADOPT-210 Adoption Agreement form requires basic information about the adoptive parents and the child as well as the signatures of the adoptive parents. The agreement contains statements, which the adoptive parents are agreeing to with their signatures, that they will adopt the child and treat the child as their natural child and that the child will maintain the same rights as any natural child would. These rights include the right to inherit from the adoptive parents. , The adoptive parents must also fill out an ADOPT-215 Adoption Order form in part. The order also includes basic information about the adoption. The remaining parts of the order will be used by the judge at the adoption hearing and will be filled out by the clerk in the event the adoption is an adoption of a Native American child. In this type of adoption, the clerk will serve the order and other relevant documents on Bureau of Indian Affairs. , If the adoption is an independent, agency, or international adoption, you must submit the relevant expenses on the ADOPT-230 Adoption Expenses form. This requires the submission of the amounts spent on hospital services, prenatal care, legal fees paid, adoption agency fees, transportation, adoption facilitator fees, counseling fees paid, adoption services provider, pregnancy expenses, court filing fees, fingerprinting fees, and any other relevant costs. , Certain adoptions and each specific local court may require additional forms.


If you are adopting a Native American child through any procedure other than a stepparent/domestic partner adoption, fill out the ADOPT-220 Adoption of Indian Child form and the ADOPT-225 Parent of Indian Child Agrees to End Parental Rights form. To determine if the local court requires additional documentation contact your county clerk’s office. , Once your forms are completed, have a third party review those forms to ensure they have been fully and appropriately completed. If you are proceeding with a third-party adoption such as one through an agency either domestically or internationally, review of the forms will most likely be available for you through the agency. For independent or stepparent/domestic partner adoption, the local court’s family law facilitator or self-help center can help review of forms. , Have all the relevant forms copied so you have enough to file with the court and provide to involved parties. You should also make several extra copies of each document for your own records. , In order for the adoption to be approved, you must get the written approval of the birth parents or get a court order that ends the parental rights.


For adoptions conducted through agencies, the agency will handle the written consent or documentation showing that the consent cannot be obtained.
In the case of a stepparent/domestic partner, the required forms must be served on the other birth parent whose rights will terminate in the adoption process. If the adoptive parents and remaining birth parent cannot find or does not know who the other birth parent is, the court may find that the steps taken to attempt the consent or obtain that knowledge was suitable and waive the requirement. , File all the required forms with the local county clerk. The clerk can give additional information on the specific additional requirements and procedures of that court. The court fees, which also vary, must be paid at the time the forms are filed. If you cannot afford the court costs, you can ask for a fee waiver. , For all adoptions, a investigation must be conducted and the investigator must file a report with the court. The investigators are usually social workers, court investigators, or licensed family therapists. To determine how investigations are handled in your county, contact the county clerk. , After the investigator’s report is filed, the court will either automatically schedule a hearing date or you must communicate with the court to schedule the hearing. Contact your county clerk’s office to determine if the report has been filed and a hearing has been scheduled or to schedule a hearing. , On the hearing date, appear before the assigned judge. Bring all the relevant documentation and parties that are available to attend. The child that is being adopted must also attend the hearing. , If the court finds that the adoption meets the requirements and is in the best interests of the child, it will approve the order and fill out the remaining section of the Adoption Order. The court can never grant the adoption if any of the following are true:


If either adoptive parent has been convicted of a felony related to child abuse, neglect, spousal abuse, child pornography, other crimes against a child, or for any crime involving rape, violence, homicide, or sexual assault;
If either adoptive parent was convicted of a felony for physical assault, battery, or a drug or alcohol related offense within the last five years. , In many adoptions, other issues must be resolved before the court.


For instance, in most cases, the parties must complete and submit the ADOPT-310 Contact After Adoption Agreement form, which explains who in the child’s birth family the child will be able to remain in contact with and what type of contact will be allowable. For International Adoptions, the court will ensure that the requirements of the Hague Convention have been meet. The parties should bring the ADOPT-216 Verification of Compliance with Hague Adoption Convention form with the required background information filled out. The court will find if the parties have met the convention’s requirements, which the international agency will help ensure the parties meet before the hearing. , Ensure that you keep several copies of each document related to the adoption including the Adoption Order with the judge’s approval of the adoption for your records.

, Children and families dealing with adoptions may require additional post-adoption preventive, supportive, and therapeutic services. The agency that was used for the adoption or the California Association of Adoption Agencies is a good resource for these types of services. "

The session usually is free, and you are not obligated to work with the agency if you attend.Attending an information session is a good way to learn about the agency and the adoption process.


You can contact nearby adoption agencies and ask if they hold information sessions. Check the time and how much it costs.
After the session, you can speak with agency staff if you want to go through with the adoption.;
, You will probably have to take several trainings, either before or as part of the home study. The trainings generally cover the following areas:The needs of children waiting to be adopted.
Any issues that are unique to adoption.
The agency’s requirements in order for you to adopt.

, The home study will involve intensive interviews with all members of your family. Before proceeding, you should confirm that everyone is on the same page and wants to go ahead with an adoption.This is a crucial step in the process. If you already have a child, then it is also important to discuss this with them and address their concerns. Make sure that everyone in your family is on the same page before you do the home study.
If your partner is hesitant, then that hesitancy will come out as part of the home study process and your adoption will be delayed. It is better to find out now whether everyone is on board.

, You should ask the agency any questions you have about the home study process. They are usually very happy to tell you what to expect and how to prepare.Be sure to ask about price. Often, if you are adopting a child from foster care, then the home study will be free. If you are adopting a child from a private agency, then you might pay $1,000-3,000.Also ask who will be interviewed as part of the home study. You and your partner will be interviewed. However, many agencies also interview the children and any adult living with you. For example, if your adult brother is living in the house, then he or she will be part of the home study.

, Most agencies will want a statement from your doctor noting your good health. You can get the form from the agency and take it to your doctor. If you haven’t had a physical in a while, then you will need to have one.


You do not have to be in perfect shape to adopt. For example, if you have a medical condition under control (such as diabetes or high blood pressure), then you can typically adopt.
However, if you have a life-threatening illness, then you may not be able to., You also need to show the agency that you have enough financial resources to support a child. In some intercountry adoptions, there are financial requirements you have to meet. You should begin by gathering the following:tax returns
W-2 forms
paycheck stubs
proof of self-employment income
bank statements
insurance policies (life, health, etc.)
information on debts

, You should gather ahead of time copies of certain vital records, which you will need to give to the adoption agency. For example, you should get certified copies of the following:birth certificates
marriage licenses
divorce decrees

, Adoption agencies will also want to check references as part of their home study, so you should identify three or four people who you want as references.Talk with your spouse about what your best references might be. You should choose as references people who satisfy the following:


Don’t select relatives. Most agencies will want non-relatives as references.
Do select people who have seen you in many different situations.
Do select people who know of your involvement with children. For example, if you volunteered with a child softball league, you could have one of the parents write a letter.

, Many adoption agencies will also ask that you write an autobiographical statement, also called a short life story.Agencies often have guidelines, which you can get from your caseworker. You can prepare by thinking about the following, which typically is included in the statement:How you were raised.
The size of your family, and where you were in the birth order.
Your relationship with your parents and siblings when you were growing up and now.
Your education and whether you plan to gain additional education.
The history of your marriage, including how you met and what attracted you to each other.
How you solve problems or resolve arguments.
Your communication style with your partner and children.
An ordinary day and how you will provide child care (if you work).
A description of your neighborhood and why you chose to live there.

, Every state requires that adoptive families have two types of background checks—a criminal background check and a child abuse records check.You should talk with the agency about whose background will be checked.


You should disclose any criminal history to your caseworker. If you try to hide embarrassing information, then the agency might refuse to work with you.
You may also have to give fingerprints as part of the background check.

, Your caseworker will probably ask you questions about your involvement with children, so spend some time thinking about this issue.You want to be able to speak confidently about your experience, but don’t memorize what you want to say. Practice ahead of time so you know what to say and feel confident saying it.


Also, think about what you have learned from your experiences with children. For example, you might teach Sunday School to a group of six-year-olds. How have you learned to communicate with them? What are their needs?

, Your caseworker will also ask about your parenting approach, so spend some time thinking about it.If you already have children, then you can talk about how you parent them.


If you don’t have any children, then analyze the parenting approaches of people you know.
Also be prepared to discuss your own parents’ approach to raising you. What did you find effective and what would you do differently? You may also want to consider talking with your parents about what they thought of their approach to parenting to get a broader perspective.

, You should be prepared to have an honest discussion with the caseworker about what has brought you to adoption. People adopt for many reasons—infertility, the loss of a child, a marriage late in life. Sometimes, you may feel intense emotions around these issues. You should be prepared to talk about them with your caseworker.Remember that your caseworker is not judging you. He or she wants to make sure that children are matched with loving families who can take care of them.

, You will also talk with the caseworker about what ages of children you want and other characteristics, such as if you will accept a child that is physically disabled.Spend some time thinking about this.


Also think about whether you want a boy or girl, and what race you prefer.

, If you are adopting a child out of foster care, then your child may have suffered trauma, so make sure that you are prepared for that. Your caseworker wants to analyze how your family is prepared to deal with issues surrounding that trauma.


Talk with your partner about whether you are prepared to undergo family counseling, if that would help.
Also discuss how you will integrate the child into your family.Make sure to ask questions about the child as well. It is important that the child is a good fit for your family and that you are a good fit for the child.

, Your caseworker will also perform a home inspection. Generally, your home must be safe and livable. However, each state also has detailed requirements you must meet. You can find these requirements at the Child Welfare Gateway.You should read them and go down through to make sure that your home satisfies all of the requirements for your state.

, The caseworker will walk through your home and check to make sure that it is safe for a child to live there.You can prepare by walking through and checking for hazards, then fixing any that you find. Look for the following:


exposed wires
rickety stairs or bannisters
pools or hot tubs that are full of water and not secure

, You need working smoke alarms in your home, as well as an accessible fire extinguisher. Your state law should tell you how many you need and where they should be located. Check to make sure the batteries are working in the smoke alarms.


At least 18 states also require that you have a working carbon monoxide detector., You need to make sure that your firearms are safely stored out of the reach of children. You should lock up your gun in a cabinet, container, or other gun safe.Also make sure your ammunition is locked up in a separate container.

, You should also make sure than any poisons are securely stored out of reach. For example, you can lock them in a high cupboard. Also make sure the following is safely stored:household chemicals, like bleach
prescription drugs
over-the-counter medications

, Go through the home and replace burned-out lightbulbs. Also make sure that you don’t have trash bags or blankets placed over windows. Your home should also have natural light.


Also check that you have sufficient heat for the home, especially during winter.

, You won’t be denied a placement because your home isn’t spotless. It is just good practice. However, your home should be clean.Throw away old newspapers and magazines, as well as old clothes piled up around the house.


Also throw out moldy food or any food that is stale. Replenish your pantry and refrigerator with fresh food.
Clean up animal dander and droppings as well.
Keep in mind that if your home is extremely dirty and you need to clean it out significantly, then you may want to reconsider your capacity for parenting a child.

, Your bathroom should have a working toilet and both running hot and cold water.Make sure to replace cracked or loose bathroom tiles and moldy shower curtains.

, Your home has to have sufficient space for your child. States in particular focus on bedrooms. For example, you may have to satisfy the following requirements, depending on your state:In some states, each child must have a certain amount of square footage.
Other states limit how many children can share a bedroom.
Nearly every state prohibits children from sharing a bedroom with a child of the opposite sex.

, Your caseworker will have at least one interview in your home. This interview will probably coincide with the home inspection. Your caseworker will inspect the home and note any problems.


If there are problems, you and your caseworker can come up with a plan to address the problems.

Consider adopting from a domestic agency.,
Decide whether to pursue independent adoption.,
Look into adopting a child from the foster care system.,
Research your options for international adoption.Adopting a child from another country is a popular option among citizens of the United States.",How to Adopt a Child1," Domestic adoption agencies in the United States work with birth mothers to find adoptive parents. Prospective adoptive parents submit details about themselves to the agencies, who then pass the information to the birth mothers. If a birth mother is interested, the agency facilitates the adoption process.


When it comes to adopting from a domestic agency, open adoptions are the most popular route. This means that prospective parents meet and form a relationship with the birth mother (and sometimes the birth father), and often keep in touch after the baby is born. Many families feel that this open process takes the mystery out of adoption and makes it feel more natural for all parties involved.
Some agencies still conduct closed adoptions. In this type of adoption, the adoptive parents have no contact with the birth mother, and the baby has no contact with the birth mother after he or she is born. Because closed adoptions are less popular than they used to be, it can be difficult to find an agency and birth mother willing to facilitate one.;
, Some people prefer to work with an independent lawyer to adopt a child, rather than going through an agency. Prospective parents may alert people they know that they are hoping to adopt a child, or they may ask the lawyer to conduct a search for a birth mother. Either way, the lawyer ensures that the adoption is conducted legally.


Adopting independently can give the adoptive parents greater control over the search process, rather than leaving it up to the agency to facilitate a match. The process of adopting independently is often faster than going through an agency.
The downside of adopting independently is that it is common for birth mothers to change their minds late in the process. Agencies have a process in place to eliminate this as a risk factor; if you're working independently, make sure your lawyer is highly experienced with adoptions to minimize the chance that this will happen.
Conducting your own search for a birth mother is not legal in every state. Make sure finding your own birth mother is legal where you live before pursuing this as an option., Adopting a child who has been placed in foster care, sometimes referred to as a ""waiting child,"" is another good option to consider. State agencies list the children available for adoption in online databases that usually include photographs and profiles. You can pursue this type of adoption by finding an agency in your area and contacting them for more information.


Children in foster care are usually over one year old, and some are in their teens. Many have been waiting a long time for loving parents to bring them into their home. Some children in foster care have disabilities, illnesses or other special needs that have caused them to have to wait longer to be adopted.
In some cases children were placed in foster care with their siblings, and they wish to be adopted together. This is something to consider if you're open to adopting more than one child.

, To pursue this route, work with a US Agency that has ties with international agencies and can facilitate the process for you.


International adoption can be a longer process than domestic adoption, since you have to meet the requirements of two countries instead of one. Conduct research on the adoption policies of different countries to find the one that makes sense for your family.
International adoptions may be closed or open, depending on the country. Make sure you're aware of the birth mother's expectations and ties you'll have to the country after the adoption is complete.

"
"
Prepare to finance the adoption.,
Get familiar with your state laws.,
Complete a home study.",How to Adopt a Child2," Each type of adoption requires a different set of fees. The process can be very expensive, especially when you factor in travel costs if you are adopting a child who lives in another country. If you're planning to adopt a child soon, anticipate spending up to $30,000 on the adoption (although it isn't always that expensive). Here are some of the expenses you can expect to encounter:


Home study fees. Prospective adoptive parents must pay for a home study in which representatives of an agency or the state come to the home to get a sense of how suitable the environment will be for a child.
Counseling fees. People adopting through an agency pay for their own counseling, as well as counseling for the birth mother.
The birth mother's medical expenses. In many cases adoptive parents pay the birth mother's expenses during her pregnancy. Sometimes they also pay for her room and board, travel, and other expenses.
The child's medical expenses. People adopting a child from another country may start paying the child's medical expenses before they even meet the child in person for the first time.
Lawyer fees. People pursuing independent adoptions can expect to pay a lawyer for helping them navigate the process. Almost all adoptive parents will hire a lawyer to finish the adoption process.
Travel expenses. Parents who are adopting a child from another state or country are responsible for paying for their own travel, hotel and meal expenses.
Expenses are often reimbursed for those adopting a child from the foster care system. Adopting a child from the state is the least expensive adoption process. In many cases the parents actually get a tax exemption that goes beyond the travel expenses and court fees required for every adoption.Adopting a child with special needs may make you eligible for an adoption subsidy., In order for the adoption to be conducted legally, you'll need to know which agencies are licensed to complete adoptions in your state. Make sure you follow your state's requirements to a T, so you won't have a legal battle to fight down the line.


Even if you aren't planning on adopting independently, it's a good idea to hire a lawyer familiar with the adoption process in your state to make sure everything is done correctly.
Remember that some states don't allow people to conduct their own search for birth mothers. Be clear on your state laws in this area before you pursue an independent adoption.

, All prospective adoptive parents must undergo a home study, a process in which a licensed social worker from the adoption agency or the state meets with each member of the family in preparation for the adoption. In addition to examining the family's living situation, the person conducting the home study spends time getting to know the family and making sure they are prepared to have a new family member enter their home.


The social worker will ask for birth and marriage certificates, personal references, and other details before finalizing his or her report.
At least one meeting with the social worker will be conducted in the prospective parents' home.The prospective parents must complete a criminal and child abuse background check, and in some states they will also be fingerprinted.
Parents may begin actively searching for a child to adopt after their home study has been approved.

"
"
Find the right agency for your family.,
Begin a relationship with a birth mother.,
Meet the child you're going to adopt.",How to Adopt a Child3," If you're pursuing domestic or international adoption through an agency, it's important to learn as much about the agency as you can before going forward. Meet with representatives from several agencies in person before you decide to move forward with one. Your relationship with the agency you choose could last for many years, so you should choose one in which you have utmost trust and confidence.


Talk with other adoptive parents. Join online support networks or local groups that have in-person meetings to discuss the adoption process. Ask questions about experiences others have had with the agencies you're considering.
Beware agencies that may try to scam you. Prospective parents are in a vulnerable position; they deeply want to be parents as soon as possible, and they have to place their faith in strangers to make that happen. Some agencies take advantage of this by requiring upfront payment before placing parents on waiting lists for years at a time. Do careful research on each agency's reputation.

, When it comes to domestic adoptions conducted through an agency or independently, the prospective parents' relationship with the birth mother is key. In many cases the birth mother has the chance to select from among several prospective parents, and she may change her mind if she doesn't feel comfortable with a situation.


If you're working with an agency, you will be asked to write a letter to the birth parent(s) and to send photos of you, your family, and your home. This is typically referred to as your profile. Once all the paperwork has been filed and approved, the agency will present your profile to the families wanting to place their baby for adoption. Many birth parents will want to interview you by phone; some will want to meet in person before making their final decision.
Have patience during this process. This can be an exciting, anxious, and frustrating time. In some cases adoptive parents hit it off with the birth mother right away, and the adoption goes smoothly; other times, parents have to go through a few false starts before finding the right match.
Once you have been selected by a birth parent and you agree to the plan, you are said to be ""matched."" The birth mother can only sign relinquishment papers after the baby is born. At that time (usually 24–48 hours after the delivery) her parental rights are terminated and at that point (in most states) the relinquishment becomes irrevocable.
Be open to the birth mother's needs. When you find a birth mother who agrees to let you adopt her child, you'll need to figure out what relationship you'll have with her during her pregnancy and after the baby is born. The adoption agency or your lawyer can help you negotiate the legal aspects of an open or closed adoption.

, After months of waiting and meeting all the necessary requirements, the time will come when you'll get to meet the child you've been waiting so long to see. This experience will be different depending on which adoption route you choose to take.


If you're adopting a child from the foster care system, you may get the chance to meet the child relatively early in the process. You may browse a database such as AdoptUSAkids.organd fall in love with a child online, then contact the agency to express your interest.

If the child's social worker thinks you are a good fit, he or she will facilitate a meeting. Since children in foster care are usually older than children adopted via other systems, they often get a say in the adoption process, too.
After a few meetings, you'll receive a placement. The child will live with you for several weeks, with frequent visits from the social worker, before the adoption is finalized.


If you're adopting a child from another country, your meeting will be dictated by that country's laws. Usually the prospective parents fly to the country and meet the child once, go home to finalize the adoption, then fly back to the country to bring the child home.
If you're adopting a baby from a birth mother with whom you have a relationship, you may get to be present in the hospital for the birth.

Fill out the paperwork.,
Go to a court hearing.",How to Adopt a Child4," If you haven't worked with a lawyer up until now, you may want to strongly consider hiring one. Adoptive parents, no matter what type of adoption they choose to have, have mounds of paperwork to fill out before the adoption is complete. A lawyer can help you make sure everything is filled out correctly so you won't have to worry about making a mistake that could cause headaches later.

, The final step is to attend a court hearing, during which a judge will rule that the adoption is complete. The adoptive parents are then given a certificate of adoption, which acts as a temporary birth certificate until a new birth certificate is drawn up for the child.


For infant adoptions, the birth mother may need to be present to sign over her parental rights.
Adoptive parents may be asked to speak about their intent to love and care for their child.
The finalization of the adoption process is often celebrated with a post-court hearing party to welcome the child to the family.

Write down what you and your family members did last week.,
Identify time sinks.,
Create a new weekly schedule with group activities.,
Consider your family’s interests.,
Check your city website for activities.,
Do something outside.,
Take your kids to a competitive event.,
Involve your children in your chores.,
Take advantage of Saturdays.,
Start a family hobby.,
Create a comfortable relaxing space for teenagers.",How to Organize Your Free Time With Your Family," Use a blank sheet of paper or a weekly calendar. Include your work schedule, family activities, time spent watching TV, and your daily commute. Be brutally honest with your schedule, even if you don’t like what you see. Examine it to identify what you and your family spend the most time doing. For example:


Write down what time you and your family members woke up every day.
Note when you commute to work and how long you spend at work.
Make a list of the things you and your family did after work each day, such as extracurricular activities, housework, and running errands.;
, You can create more free time for you and your family by eliminating or reducing time wasting activities.To identify these activities, try sitting down as a family and identifying things that you all do that might be considered time sinks or time wasters.


Try asking your significant other and kids, ""What things do you think occupy the majority of your free time? What are your biggest time wasters?"" Then, write down what everyone says.
After you have a list of everyone's time sinks, work together to find ways to reduce or eliminate time sinks. For example, if your significant other says that he or she spends a lot of time organizing the family room at the end of the night, then you might suggest that organizing the family room become a family activity. This will cut down on the time it takes your significant other to organize the room and it might be a good opportunity for your family to work together as a team.
Also, keep in mind that everyone needs some alone time to relax. While you might see your teenage son's after-school television time as a time waster, he might view this as an important part of his daily winding down routine.

, Now that you’ve eliminated the time-wasters in your life, you’ll have hours to dedicate to family activities. Starting with a blank sheet of paper, write down all of your time commitments. Next, fill in the schedule information for your other family members.Fill your free time by scheduling family activities wherever you can.


Try to aim for about an hour of family time on weeknights and a little more time on the weekend.
Have your children help choose the activities you’ll do. This will help keep them interested.
Avoid scheduling too many taxing family activities in a row. For example, if you go to the zoo on a Saturday afternoon, have a relaxing movie night on Tuesday evening.

, Make sure you plan family outings that everyone will enjoy. Choose activities that all of your children are excited about, regardless of their age. If you have a teenaged child that doesn’t seem excited about group outings, renew their interest by allowing them to pick the activity. Some examples of age-inclusive events include:


Going on a weekend trip to a nearby tourist attraction
Going to a soccer game
Working on a home project together, Most cities and towns have well-maintained websites listing free and cheap activities for families. You can also find coupons for local museums and restaurants. If you can’t think of anything to do with your children, look on that website for inspiration. City-hosted family friendly events include:


Carnivals
Holiday festivals
Petting zoos
Book fairs

, Between school and working, the chances are good that you and your child spend a lot of time inside. Improve your health and your mood by spending time outside together. Take a walk, play a game of tag, play hopscotch, or throw a football around.If you don’t have a yard, find a nearby park to spend time in.
If you have time, take your kids camping to maximize their time outside.

, Competitive events are exciting to attend and might foster a lifelong passion in your child. Find events that are based off of mutual interests. For example, if you both enjoy Bruce Lee movies, attend a martial arts competition. Some other events include:


Sports gamesDance competitions
Chili cook-offs
Short film competitions

, If you spend hours a day working on your home, try involving your children and making it a fun family activity. For example, have your children help you make dinner. Let them choose the recipe (within reason), stir the bowl, and sample the final product. They’ll learn how to cook and you’ll get to spend quality time with your kids. Some other examples include:


Turning house cleaning into a game by assigning points and prizes
Planting and maintaining a garden together
Doing a timed ten-minute tidy of the house with treats as rewards, If you don’t work on Saturdays, set that day aside for family activities. Spend the day playing outside with your kids and grilling burgers. Alternatively, go on a day trip to a nearby tourist location. This will get your kids out of the house and teach them about their community. Some other Saturday activities include:


Going to the closest beach or national park to spend time outdoors
Visiting a fire station and learning about being a firemanGoing to an art or science museum
Doing volunteer work with your children

, Find something that everyone is interested in and spend some time doing it every week. You will get to spend valuable time with your children while teaching them a skill or fostering an interest.For example:


If your children are interested in computer games, try building a simple game together.

If your child enjoys cooking, take a series of family cooking classes.
If your son or daughter enjoys playing with electronics, join a robotics club together.

, Most teenagers aren’t interested in family activities or day trips. However, you probably still want to spend quality time with your child. To do so, create a welcoming, comfortable space that’s perfect for hanging out and talking.In this spot, you and your teenager can have a snack, do homework, or just chat.


For example, add pillows to the chairs at your kitchen table to make them more inviting. Your teenager can hang out and do homework while you cook.
Make sure the space is clean and inviting. If the space is cluttered, your teenager may not want to spend time there.
Let your teenager make design choices when arranging the space to foster their interest.

Fill out appropriate paperwork.,
Pay the fees.",How to Adjust Immigration Status of an Adopted Niece or Nephew1," This is a complicated area of law. You will definitely need expert legal advice because the process of adopting a niece or nephew is not easy.You should get referrals for an immigration lawyer and schedule a consultation.


At the consultation, discuss your niece or nephew’s situation. Ask the attorney what options you have.
If the child is an orphan, explain that to the lawyer. You may be able to petition the child as an orphan.
Ask if the lawyer can help you with the adoption process. If the lawyer can’t, then ask for a referral to an adoption lawyer, preferably one who also handles immigration issues.;
, In order for an adopted child to qualify for a green card, the child must be under 16 years of age.Because the adoption also has to be finalized before you can adjust the child’s status, the child should ideally be under 15., You must have had legal and physical custody for two years before you file a petition.This means your niece or nephew must already be in the United States or you live with the child in another country for two years.


If you want to bring the child to the U.S. on a temporary visa, then talk to your lawyer about your options.
If the child snuck into the U.S. illegally, you can still get custody. However, your niece or nephew faces the possibility of being deported.A child probably won’t be deported unless he or she commits a serious crime. Nevertheless, the potential exists.

, The adoption must also be finalized before you can petition the court for a visa or an adjustment of status for the child.You should meet with your adoption attorney to discuss the adoption process and timelines.


Remember that the adoption decree must have been awarded before the child turns 16., You will need to petition the U.S. government to recognize the legal status of the child. However, the paperwork you fill out will depend on whether your niece or nephew is currently in the U.S. and whether they came into the U.S. legally.Entered the U.S. without inspection. This means the child likely crossed the border illegally. He or she was not inspected and admitted at a port of entry. In this situation, you will need to complete Form I-130 and submit it.Once it is approved, you will need to take the child to the U.S. Consulate abroad to complete the application.
Is not currently in the U.S. If your niece or nephew is overseas, then you will need to submit Form I-130 and then complete the application at the U.S. Consulate overseas before travelling to the U.S.
Entered the U.S. legally. Your niece or nephew might have had a visa to enter the country but have overstayed. In this situation, you can fill out a Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, and a Form I-485, Adjustment of Status, and submit them at the same time. You don’t have to travel overseas.

, You have to pay a fee for both the Form I-130 petition and the Form I-485, Adjustment of Status petition.You should pay both using check or money order, payable to “U.S. Department of Homeland Security.” Don’t use other abbreviations.


The fee for Form I-130 is $420.
The fee for Form I-485 is generally $985, though it may differ, depending on the circumstances. You should read the instructions for the form."

Make an informed decision.,
Meet the qualifications.,
Consider the cost.,
Select an agency.,
Meet the legal criteria.",How to Adopt a Child As a Single Man1," As a single man, you must realize the difficulties involved because of both your gender and your marital status. Recent trends make adopting children by single men more acceptable, but men are likely the most prejudiced against demographic among people looking to adopt.Research which countries will allow a single man to adopt a child. Not all countries are open-minded to the possibility of having one parent let alone it being a man.
Consider your age, career, and capacity to raise an infant. It may be more suitable to prefer a teenager or a child with a disability who would love to have a father.
Be prepared to adopt an older child or a child with disabilities. A severe shortage of adoptive parents for these children makes single men an attractive option to fill this role.;
, There are several different ways to proceed when considering adoption. Adoption is handled by public and private agencies, adoption attorneys, facilitators, or some combinations of this list. There are few solid rules about age, marital status, or sources of income to become a candidate to adopt. Age requirements are flexible, but successful prospective applicants are usually in the 25-50 age range. The type of child you are adopting will have some influence on age requirements, but no actual rule exists to determine this.
As an adoptive parent, this can be your first child, one of many children, or you can even already have adult children by the time you decide to adopt.
Most agencies, some more reluctant than others, accept single, gay and lesbian, and disabled parent applicants.
There are no predetermined income levels and home ownership is not a requirement either. Your income can originate from a variety of sources: employment, pension, or disability payments.

, The cost of adoption is expensive, but is varied depending on which agency you choose. Adopting an international, special needs teenager, through a public or government agency is more affordable than adopting a domestic, Caucasian baby, through a private agency. From the moment you begin to seriously consider adoption, start saving money in a special savings account dedicated to the process and add to it whenever possible.Consider the following: domestic private agency ($4,000-30,000+); domestic independent adoptions ($8,000-30,000+); and Inter-country private agency ($7,000-25,000+). The Fees include most, but not all, costs associated with adoption. For international adoptions, you will also have to consider traveling and lodging costs, visas, passports, and country fees.
Gender, race, and age of children will also dramatically influence cost. Healthy Caucasian infants are most expensive since they are the most requested and are the least available. Teenagers, because of age, and children with disabilities, because of additional care costs, are less expensive to pursue, but more available to single men. The recent trend for children of color, and in particular indigenous children, is to match them with parents who are of similar ethnicity.

, Make sure to research all the adoption agencies under consideration. Selecting an agency that is educated and experienced can relieve a lot of stress and anxiety with more positive results. Also consider their reputation, if they provide credible references, or a detailed history of their adoptions.


Verify the agency’s license by calling your state adoption agency licensing specialist to check if they are current and have no complaints lodged against them.
Conduct a background check for either criminal behavior or lawsuits or call the Better Business Bureau for more information.
Inquire about their services: do they offer pre- and post-adoption services?
Find out their perspective on single-father adoption candidates.
Request an itemized list of fees, expenses, and hidden costs.

, There are several legal requirements included in the adoption process, even more for international adoptions. Working with an attorney is expensive, therefore, be prepared to meet an extensive array of legal criteria.Adoption and family law is a specialization. Make sure you contact a lawyer who specializes in this field and has previous experience with legal adoptions.
Always request references from professional people.
Contact the Academy of Adoption Attorneys to find an appropriate attorney.
Once you select an attorney, take their advice.
Part of the process is providing a significant amount of personal and family history, social security cards, employment history, and financial records.
If you have a preference, make sure your attorney knows the characteristics of the child you prefer to adopt.

Keep you Home Study current.,
File the adoption petition.,

Attend the final hearing.",How to Do a Private Adoption," There is not a constitutional right to adopt a child.As a result, all adoption rights, procedures, and requirements are governed by state statutes with some guidance from the federal government. In general, under current state laws, any single adult or heterosexual married couple is eligible to adopt if they meet certain criteria.


With the legalization of same sex marriage, adoption laws are in flux. Most states statutes are silent on this issue. In Florida, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Virginia, Utah, and Connecticut, the state laws either explicitly forbid adoption by, or place roadblocks in the path of, same sex couples. Until the lawmakers act, LGBT married couples should consult with an attorney skilled in adoption law to discuss the specific laws of your state.Age requirements of prospective parents, if listed in the statute, range from 18 to 25. Six states, California, Georgia, Nevada, New Jersey, South Dakota, and Utah, require that the adoptive parent be at least ten years older than the adoptee. In Idaho, it is 15 years.Consult the laws of your state for the specific eligibility requirements.;
, Seventeen states require that you be a resident of the state with periods ranging from 60 days to one year.Your residency can be proved through your driver's license, mortgage receipts, tax records, utility receipts, and car registration information.


If you are unsure, consult with an adoption attorney or agency. In general, the states that require you to be a resident are Arizona, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
If you or your spouse are members of the military, there may be exceptions to the residency requirements. Consult with a local JAG attorney, family law attorney, or adoption agency to see if the residency requirement can be waived.

, Facilitators are unlicensed individuals and organizations who match birth mothers with prospective adoptive parents.Facilitators range from non-profit organizations to businesses that charge a very large fee for the introduction.


Adoption facilitators operate outside the legal framework and are not held to any of the same licensing and competency requirements of the professional agencies.
Adoption facilitators are not legal in all states. Check state laws in both the state of your residence and the state where the child may reside and verify that using a facilitator is allowed.
Some facilitators have good reputations and have a vast network of community contacts for finding birth mothers who want to put babies up for adoption.If you want to consider using a facilitator, you must research them carefully. You want a reputable organization with a track record of successful placements. Ask for references and check them carefully. Ask about fees and request they be put in writing., In a private adoption, the birth parents transfer their rights directly to the adoptive parents rather than the state or an adoption agency.However, the adoption is still governed by state law and there are many legal procedures and requirements you must meet for the adoption to be granted. Most adoptive parents work with an attorney to guide them through the process.


Choose an attorney with experience in private adoptions. When you interview attorneys, ask if they are a member of the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys or an equivalent state accreditation.If your attorney is not accredited, question her about her specific experience handling private adoptions. The AAAA maintains a directory of accredited adoption attorneys in the United States.A private adoption where the adoptive parents and the birth mother have not agreed beforehand can cost over $20,000.Before you make the financial and emotional investment in the adoption, you want an attorney who is familiar with all federal, state, and local laws and procedures. Depending on your location, expect to pay $100 to $200 per hour for skilled legal assistance.
Because of the complexities of the adoption process and the potential for negative consequences, it is not recommended that you attempt to do an adoption pro se. Even a consent adoption within the family, for example, an aunt and uncle adopting a nephew with full consent of the birth parents, should still be prepared and shepherded through the court by an attorney.

, All states require that prospective adoptive parents participate in a home study. There are no exceptions for private adoptions. While a source of stress for many, the home study is intended to educate you about the process and evaluate your home life and capability to be an adoptive parent.Home studies vary by state. Some require you attend an orientation and training class. Others will be conducted strictly at your home. Your attorney can familiarize you on the procedure in your state.
State law determines who can conduct a home study. In a private adoption, it will most likely be done by a private agency licensed by the state. Expect to pay up to $1,000 for your home study.
Your home study may take three to six months to complete. Many prospective parents do the home study while waiting to be matched with a birth mother.

, The interviews and inspections may be long and feel very invasive. However, it is critical that you participate openly and enthusiastically. Questions will vary by state requirements, but there are some common themes.


You will be asked about the family background of everyone living in the home. Be prepared to discuss your childhood and how you were parented, including feelings on discipline. Be prepared to submit to a criminal background check.
The interviewer will ask about your education and employment, including future plans. If asked, be ready to produce income and expense information.
Be ready to talk about your daily routines. If you have other children, what schedules and routines do you keep. If you and your partner work, the interview will ask how you intend to integrate the needs of the child into your schedule. You should be ready to discuss how you will handle child care.
Your home will be inspected for safety and suitability. You do not have to own your own home or have a separate bedroom for each child. If you have concerns about where you live, discuss it with your adoption attorney.The Home Study will probe the state of your relationship and your support system. Single parents will be asked about dating and romantic relationships. Married parents will be encouraged to talk about the relationship and how a child might affect the marriage. , You do not have to have located an adoptive child before the Home Study. However, most states require that if a certain amount of time, usually 6 months, elapses, the process must be repeated and an updated report prepared. Discuss your concerns with the Home Study agency and your attorney., Once a child has been identified and the Home Study completed, your attorney will prepare and file the adoption petition with the court. The petition will identify you and your partner, the birth parents, consent to the adoption, and ask the court to grant the adoption. When the petition is filed, the court clerk will set it on the judge's calendar for an initial review.

, Your lawyer will have the adoption papers delivered to the birth parents. In a private adoption where there is not an issue of consent, your lawyer will likely meet with the birth parents and have them sign the documents.


No consent to the adoption is binding until the child is born.Your attorney will explain to you whether the birth parents have any opportunity to revoke consent. In some states, the signature is considered irrevocable. In other states, there may be a grace period of up to 30 days.If the birth parents refuse to sign or revoke consent, the adoption cannot proceed.
In a private adoption, the court will not compel consent or sever parental rights. If the birth parents refuse to consent and are unfit, the child will be taken into state custody.
A refusal to give consent or a revocation can be emotionally devastating to the adoptive family. You must be prepared for this possibility and have a support system in place to deal with your loss.

, Adoption hearings can either be part of the regular court schedule or on a special adoption docket. Assuming the consent and Home Study are in order, the judge will review the file and issue the orders that finalize the adoption.


Discuss the hearing with your lawyer. If you are scheduled on the regular docket, do not bring balloons, cameras, or large groups. Your adoption may be scheduled in between a divorce, a child support modification, and a motion about visitation. Do not disrupt or delay the court's schedule. Save the party for after the hearing.
If you are scheduled on a special adoption docket, the procedure will be relaxed and more festive. However, still check with your attorney before using your camera in the courtroom.
Unless your state allows for an appeal, the adoption is final when signed by the judge.

You should find an immigration lawyer and schedule a consultation, where you can get answers to any questions that you have.


See Find an Immigration Lawyer for more information.

, Only a U.S. citizen can sponsor a sibling to immigrate to the United States. If you are a green card holder, then you unfortunately can’t.Siblings are not counted as “immediate relatives.” Accordingly, they won’t be able to immediately immigrate to the United States. Instead, they will need to wait until a visa becomes available in their category.
Your sibling might already be in the U.S., for example on a work visa. However, he or she still must wait for a visa to be made available before they can apply to adjust their status.

, Before beginning this lengthy process, you should figure out if your adopted niece or nephew will qualify. In order to qualify, they must meet the definition of “children” under U.S. immigration law.


The children must have been legally adopted before your sibling is admitted into the U.S.This means your sibling can’t come to the U.S. and then try to adopt the children.
The child must have been adopted before age 16, and your sibling must have had at least two years of legal and physical custody., You will need to file a Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, to start the process. You can download the form and its instructions from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website.You can also request forms by calling 1-800-375-5283., You should provide the requested information by printing neatly using black ink. You might also type the information into the form. If you need extra space, then attach a sheet of paper and identify the item number.The form will ask for the following information:


information about you, such as name, address, place and date of birth, and Social Security Number
information about your relative, such as name, address, date and place of birth
other information about your sibling, including gender, marital status, and dates of prior marriages
information if your sibling is already in the U.S.
your sibling’s spouse and children (list your niece or nephew if they are under 21 and not married)
address where your sibling intends to live
your signature under penalty of perjury

, You will need to provide USCIS with documents that show your relationship to your sibling. Read the instructions to Form I-130 to see specifically what you need. You should gather these documents ahead of time so that you can provide them with your I-130 petition:copy of your birth certificate
copy of your sibling’s birth certificate showing you have one common parent
information about your father’s marriages, such as marriage certificates and divorce decrees, if you share a common father but different mothers
information about adoptions if you and your sibling are related through adoption

, You need to pay a $420 filing fee by check or money order. Make payment out to “U.S. Department of Homeland Security.” Do not abbreviate to “USDHS” or “DHS.”Filing fees are subject to change. You should call 1-800-375-5283 to get the most current fee information.

, Gather your petition and your supporting documents. Make a copy for your records. Then put the entire application into an envelope. You will send the application to either the Chicago or Phoenix office, depending on where you live.


Read the instructions to find the particular office where you should send your application., Eventually, a visa may become available. Your sibling will be notified by the National Visa Center (NVC) and given directions on what to do next.


If you listed your niece or nephew as a dependent, then they should be able to immigrate to the U.S. at the same time.

, Your sibling can get permanent resident status (green card) in one of two ways. If they are outside the country, they will use “consular processing.” Their notice from NVC will tell them when to show up for consular processing.


If your sibling is legally already inside the U.S., then they will need to adjust their status by completing Form I-485, which is available for download from USCIS.Remember, your sibling must be in the U.S. legally. If they snuck in illegally, then they must return to the home country and undergo consular processing.
Your adopted niece or nephew can also gain permanent resident status at the same time as their parents.

, Your sibling might have come to the U.S. alone. If so, then your niece or nephew qualifies for “following-to-join” benefits. They will not need to wait for a visa. Instead, your sibling needs to inform the U.S. Consulate that they are a permanent resident so that their children can then get an immigrant visa.


Your sibling will need to file various forms, depending on whether they have already adjusted their own status. If they have, then they need to file Form I-824, a copy of the petition used to apply for immigrant status, Form I-797, and a copy of their green card.See the USCIS website for more information.

Convince family and friends.,
Make your family and friends aware of your commitment to adoption and that you have decided that this is the best for you and the adopted the child.,
Deal with adoption agencies.,
Fight against tradition.",How to Adopt a Child As a Single Man2," As a single man trying to adopt, many family and friends might question your motivations and not understand why you would want the responsibility of raising a child on your own. Despite the backlash, you never have to legally worry about a family member or a friend derailing the adoption process.Educate them regarding the benefits of adopting and how rewarding an endeavor it is. Let them know of all the benefits and joys of raising an adopted child.

,


Let them know that their support is crucial for the adoption to be a success.
Try not to keep your adoption a secret unless it would bring harm to you or your child’s wellness or physical well-being.

, Although domestic adoption is legal for single men, not all agencies support that perspective. Agencies might not accept single men as potential parents, they might delay the adoption process or offer you children that they know you would not be able to handle.It is important to demonstrate to an adoption agency that you have a plan in place and have the means to carry out. It is also a good idea to reveal your thoughts about single-parenthood to prove that you have considered all perspectives.
Displaying true determination and assertiveness to an adoption agency will prove that you are serious about completing the adoption process and raising a child by yourself.
As a single man, it would be wise to participate in a home study. A home study will evaluate your character, community, childhood, living arrangements, financial records, and the overall desire to adopt. Because single male applicants are not desirable among some adoption agencies, a home study will go a long way in proving your seriousness.

, Single-parent adoption is still highly debated. Many agencies and birth mothers will never agree to a single-man adoption because they argue that it will deprive an infant a nurturing mother and deny older children a traditional two-parent family.Adoption agencies have established qualifications for adoptive parents based on age, previous children, financial status, employment, religion, and marital status. Even if a single man meets all of these requirements except for the marital status, they might be denied an opportunity to adopt.
Join an adoptive parent group to discuss the obstacles and ways to overcome them. Many members will already possess experience that you can learn from. Seek out single-people only support groups (they do exist).

Select a child.,
Search for a child.,
Discover a match.,
Meet your child.,
Receive a placement.,
Finalize your adoption.",How to Adopt a Child As a Single Man3," After you have determined that adoption is the right path for you, make a decision on what type of adoption you want to pursue. You will have to make many decisions – age, race, special needs, domestic, international, or foster – before you move forward. Take time to make the right decision.If you already have a child or children, think about how an adopted child would adapt to your established family structure.
Consider the community you live in. If you choose a child with disabilities or of a different ethnic background, will they thrive in this environment?
Think about your own abilities. Can you manage to raise an infant by yourself? Do you have the financial means to adopt a child and get them through college? Are there enough available resources around you to care for a special needs adoption?
Stay open-minded and don’t narrow the possibilities. There are many children who need good homes and families.
Consider adopting more than one child. The more the merrier.

, Once you have completed the home study and selected an adoption agency, it is time to search for a child. Predetermine what type of child best suits your personality and lifestyle; get advice from friends and family; and network with others who have adopted in the past so that you can register for a match.It is important to remain patient since this step could take a long time until a match is found.
Once your home study is being reviewed for a match, information will be sent to you about the child up for adoption. This is a time when you can ask further questions. Then you must either confirm or withdraw your interest.
Remember that case workers receive several requests and you are not the only person who may have the opportunity to adopt. The final decision will always rest on the child’s needs.

, Once the case worker decides you are the right match, more confidential information is shared so that you can confirm this child is suitable for you.Once the match is approved, the child’s parental rights will be terminated so that you can adopt the child.
If you are not chosen as an adoptive parent, you might want to consider other possible children you could adopt through your agency. Or, you could select to be a backup adoptive parent in case the chosen family declines to follow through with the adoption.

, After the initial meeting, you will make several more visits over the next few weeks or months as the paperwork is being completed. If your child resides in a different state, the child’s agency will typically arrange for a minimum of two visits. , The placement is a date when the child will arrive at your home. The adoption agency will conduct several visits during this time in a supervisory role to make sure the transition is a smooth one.It is during this time that you file a legal intent to adopt petition.

, At this point, your adopted child is officially part of your legal family once a judge finalizes everything. An amended birth certificate will arrive with your name as the parent along with a certificate of adoption.
Counseling and supervision will continue by the adoption agency. Take this time to talk to your child about the adoption if they are old enough to understand.
Be a good parent by seeking out support services, connecting with other adopted families and children, and when ready, consider adopting a sibling.

Love the child.,
Find activities that the child will be interested in that will benefit them intellectually and emotionally.,
If you live in a culture that values privacy and personal space (e.g., modern western cultures), give them a personal space to spend time in, and respect that space as theirs.,
If your child is of a different religion or nationality than you, respect it.,
Ask questions, but don't pry.,
Let the child have some control over the family choices.,
Never put down or attack the biological parent's character.,
Relax.,
Know when to seek professional help.",How to Bond With Your Adopted Child," Let them know that you are there for them and that you would like to spend time with them.;
, Spend time with them so that you can learn more about them and bond.

, Knock on the door before entering, and, no matter how much you may dislike it, allow them to decorate and paint (or help them paint) the room so that it is their own space. They need to feel that the new home is their own and that they can feel comfortable staying there. Howbeit this may not be practical if they must share rooms with others, as not every family is able to afford each family member his or her own space, especially in developing countries. It is more important to emphasize mutual love and respect for all members of the household.

, Ask the child if they would like to celebrate certain holidays or parts of their heritage, and, if applicable, try learning about them. Ask the child if they can help you to learn about the religion or heritage/celebration. Go to the library or search online about what is involved and have the child show you what they know about it. It may not be part of what you consider ""the holidays"" but it will need to be from now on. Even if the child doesn't speak up about it, you still need to ask if they would like to celebrate or learn about it. Otherwise, resentment may quietly build. Don't worry too much about holidays. Focus on unreserved love for the child, and taking care of his or her needs.

, Talk about their past in an open way. Never try to hide the fact or forget the fact that they were adopted. Staying open and honest will make them trust you and will turn you into ""mom or dad"" faster than lying or faking it ever would.

, Let them choose a family dinner each night, a family activity each week, a game you play, or a movie you see. They need to have a little bit of control in a life that has previously been so out of their control.

, Even if they gave the child up for adoption for horrible reasons and even if you disagree with their lifestyle, don't tell the child that the biological parents were ""bad"" or ""worthless"". No good can come of this, it will only reflect badly upon you in the long run. Remember, if you have nothing good to say about someone, then do not say anything. Benjamin Franklin once said this regarding his success in interpersonal relationships: I speak of all the good things of men, and none of the bad.

, The relationship will build with time. As the child begins to see that you respect and care about them, love will grow. Be patient. They will slowly begin to see you as ""mom or dad"" and their early life will become less important as they become involved in school, sports, etc. Just try to be an open and honest parent, and everything will work out fine!

, Many children are adopted from abusive homes, drug dealer homes, nonfunctional homes, and may have seen and been involved in harsh home situations. Quite often, the adopted child may have emotional issues and learning disabilities that may require professional help to overcome.

Schedule and complete post-adoption reports.",How to Adopt a Baby from China," Only 17 countries are allowed to adopt children from China, they are the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.If you are not a citizen of one of these countries, The People’s Republic of China will not permit you to adopt.


There are two sets of steps that must be followed when you adopt a baby from China. One set of steps involves what is required by the Chinese government and the Hague Convention. These steps are the same for citizens of any country allowed to adopt from China. The second set of steps involved what is required from your specific country for immigration and citizenship purposes. These steps will differ for each of the 17 allowed countries. You will need to ensure you follow the proper steps for your home country.
Each adoption agency is permitted to work with citizens from specific countries (i.e. Agency X may be accredited to work with citizens from the U.S. and Canada). Therefore, the adoption agency you hire will be aware of your specific country's steps for immigrating a baby from China and will be able to help you through that part of the process.;
, Before you start the adoption process, make sure you meet the minimum requirements for an international adopter. The basics include the following:


Couples must be married for a minimum of 2 years. If either spouse was previously divorced (a maximum of two times), the minimum is raised to 5 years.
Adopters must be between 30 and 50 years old.
Adopters must have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of less than 40.
Adopters must be in good mental and physical health.
Income must equal at least $10,000 per family member (including potential adoptee). Net worth must be at least $80,000.
No criminal history or alcohol abuse for the previous 10 years. No history of drug use. No history of domestic violence, sexual abuse or child abuse.
Adopters must have a minimum of a high school diploma.
There are additional requirements for men and women who are looking to adopt as singles.
Some criteria may be flexible, but you should discuss this with an adoption agency before proceeding.

, All adoptions in China must be handled via an adoption agency that has been accredited by both the China Center for Adoption Affairs (CCAA) AND the Hague Convention.Individuals are not permitted to apply for adoption on their own.The Inter-country Adoption section of the U.S. Department of State maintains a list of all approved and accredited U.S. based adoption agencies on their website, listed by state.
The best way to find a great adoption agency is via referrals. Using online discussion boards for adoptive parents to ask for recommendations. And ask potential adoption agencies to give you names and numbers of references to speak to.
Review the complete fee structure and contract provided by the agency. Consider taking the contract to a lawyer for review.

, Each adoption agency will have their own adoption application for you to complete, but in general will ask you to provide information such as: background information on both spouses, marriage information, information about existing children, arrest history, health information, information about your extended family, information about your employers, references, net worth calculation, information about any past adoptions you’ve attempted, and the reason why you wish to adopt a child from China.Some adoption agencies will also ask you to complete a form outlining what medical conditions you’re willing to allow your adoptive child to have. Since most adoption agencies recommend adopting a “waiting list” child (i.e. special needs child) they need to know what types of children you’d be willing to consider., This additional documentation is required to accompany your application letter and is used to prove you meet the eligibility requirements. All documentation must be original and authenticated by the government of your country AND notarized by the embassy or consulate of the People’s Republic of China in your country.You will need to obtain the following documentation (in some cases for both spouses):


Birth certificates.
Marriage certificate.
Occupation, income and financial status certificates.
Physical examination certificates.
Criminal record certificates.
Copy of passports.
Select or take the required photographs. (Each adoption application must include several photographs - two copies of head shots of each spouse, without any items on the head, plus six family photos.)

, A home study is a report outlining the details of you and your family and must be completed by an accredited organization.The agency who performs your home study will also check all available child abuse registries for any references to yourself, and anyone over the age of 18 who lives with you., Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This form is for countries that have follow the Hague Adoption Convention, which includes China.Form I-800A - Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country - must be completed first. The completed form, plus filing fee, must be submitted by mail to the USCIS in Texas. There is a $775 fee for the application, plus an additional $85 fee for biometrics (if required) for each person 18 and older who will be living with the applicant, plus an additional $385 fee if Supplement 3 is required.A successful home study must be completed before you can submit a I-800A. You do not need to have a specific child in mind to submit this form., Once all your documentation is complete, the adoption agency will submit the package to the China Center for Adoption Affairs (CCAA) for registration, review, approval and matching., Adopting children from China is regulated under the Hague Convention, which requires parents to attend a minimum of 10 hours of workshops before the child comes home.Most adoption agencies will offer this training themselves, or will be able to recommend a place to take the training.

, Unfortunately this is a big step in the process of adopting a child from China. Once the Chinese government has received your application, it will be registered, reviewed and eventually matched with an appropriate child., Once the Chinese government has reviewed your application, they will attempt to match you with a suitable child. When they have found such a match, they will provide notification to you via your adoption agency. The notification will include information about the matched child, including information as to how the child came up for adoption and a medical history.Review the child’s info with the assistance of the adoption agency.
You may wish to review the child’s medical history with a medical expert or pediatrician, especially if there are any items of concern listed.
If you have any questions about the child or their medical history, tell the adoption agency and they will attempt to obtain more information for you.If you choose to adopt the child, sign the acceptance letter. The adoption agency will submit the acceptance letter back to the Chinese government.
If you choose to refuse the child, tell the adoption agency and they will inform the Chinese government. Refusal a match for reasonable circumstances (i.e. medical condition, etc.) should not hurt your chances for another match.

, Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for your child. This form is also for countries that have follow the Hague Adoption Convention, which includes China.Form I-800 - Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative - cannot be completed until Form I-800A has been approved. Form I-800 is submitted to the same mailing address, and no additional fees are required.Form I-800 cannot be completed until after you’ve accepted a match, but must be approved before you go to China to pick up your child.Once you receive preliminary approval for I-800, you can apply for a U.S. visa for your child via the Department of State at the U.S. Consulate., The People’s Republic of China will issue a Notice of Traveling to China for Adoption to the adopting couple which will permit them to travel to China to pick-up their child.Ensure your passport is valid for at least 6 months from the date of your travel., In order to visit China, you will need to receive a visa.Because you are going for the purpose of adopting a child, you will most likely have to apply for an M visa, which applies to those conducting business in China.To apply for an M visa, you should:


Have your passport ready and available. It needs to have at least six months of remaining validity.Complete the visa application.On this visa application, you will have to include your personal information, which includes you occupation, education, and marital status.You will also need to include information about the purpose of your visit and where you will be staying., When you complete the visa application, along with any other required documents, you will need to submit them to the Visa Office of the Chinese Embassy.You will need to submit the application in person, or through an agent who will submit the application in person.You may be required to have an interview with the Visa Office if the office feels it is necessary.No appointment is necessary to drop off an application.You are not allowed to mail, fax, or email a completed application.The processing time varies from one to 4 business days, depending on the service you selected.For example, the regular service takes about four days while the rush service takes about one day., Once your application is reviewed and and approved, you will be required to pay a fee.The regular service fee is $140.00.If you want to expedite the application process, you will have to pay an additional $20.00 to $30.00.The fee can be paid by credit card, money order, or check.No cash is accepted., The total length of your stay in China will be approximately 15 days. You will most likely fly directly to a major city, such as Hong Kong, Beijing or Guangzhou, then take a second flight to the capital city of the province where your child is located. Before you can leave China, but after the adoption paperwork is finalized, you will have to travel to Guangzhou to visit the U.S. Consulate. You’ll most likely have to stay in Guangzhou for 5 or 6 days while waiting for the appropriate paperwork from the U.S. Consulate.Remember that your flight home will include an extra person! Make sure you book the appropriate tickets for your child based on their age.
Adoption agencies recommend that both parents go on the trip to China. If, for any reason, one of the parents is unable to travel to China, adoption agencies highly recommend the parent who is going bring a supportive companion with them., The Center for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States has an extensive website which lists all vaccinations and immunizations that travelers to specific geographical areas may wish to obtain before they travel. Once you know you’ll be travelling, check out the CDC’s page for China to determine which vaccinations/immunizations you should get, then make an appointment with the appropriate medical clinic to obtain them.

, Each province within China has its own department of civil affairs. When you were issued the Notice of Travelling to China for adoption, the government also sent a Notice of Foreign-related Adoption to the department of civil affairs in the province where the child is located. You must take your notice directly to this department in the province where the child is located., Registration of your adoption is completed by the department of civil affairs in the province where the child is located. You will be required to submit a Registration Application Letter of Foreigners Coming to China for Adoption and submit it, along with the notice you received, your passports and photos, and a signed adoption agreement. The department of civil affairs will review and approve these documents and issue both an Adoption Registration Certificate and a Certificate of Conformity of Intercountry Adoption to you.The adoption agreement is essentially a contract signed by you (the adopters) and the person who has placed the child up for adoption (parents, guardian, etc.).

, The moment you’ve been waiting for! You may have the opportunity to meet your child during the adoption registration process, or after. In many cases you’ll be able to meet your child at the orphanage where they were housed. You will probably have a massive mixture of emotions going through you at this point, but this is what all that hard work and waiting was for - congratulations!

, Several official Chinese documents are required for your child before you can apply for their immigrant visa from the U.S. Consulate. You will need to obtain a new birth certificate, Chinese passport and exit permit for your child when in Guangzhou.


Apply for a new birth certificate for your child. This new birth certificate will include your name(s) and is required in order to obtain a Chinese passport.Get your child a Chinese passport and exit permit. Your child needs a Chinese passport in order to qualify for a U.S. immigrant visa. You need to obtain the passport before you go to the U.S. Consulate.The Chinese Public Security Bureau is responsible for issuing Chinese passports for children adopted by foreigners., In order to obtain a U.S. immigrant visa to bring your child home, he or she must have a medical examination completed in China by an approved “panel physician”.The report from that medical examination is then part of the visa application and is reviewed by the Consular Officer.Medical examinations from approved panel physicians can be obtained in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, or Taishan. The U.S. Department of State recommends the Guangzhou Health and Quarantine Service in Guangzhou, as it’s located close to the main U.S. Consulate where you need to go for your visa application.Regardless of where you obtain the medical exam, the physician will complete a form called the Medical Examination for Immigrant or Refugee Applicant from the U.S. Department of State. You will then take this signed form with you to the U.S. Consulate., Children adopted from a Hague Convention country (including China) will receive either a IH-3 or a IH-4 visa from the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou.

, You need to provide the CBP Officer with your child’s immigrant visa (which would have been placed in your child’s Chinese passport at the U.S. Consulate) AND the sealed Immigrant Data Summary package (which would have been provided to you by the U.S. Consulate).The CBP Officer will keep the Immigration Data Summary package and forward it to the USCIS to be added to your child’s official records., The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 allows children adopted by U.S. citizens to automatically get a U.S. citizenship if the child is under 18 years of age, the child’s U.S. parent is living with the child and has legal custody of the child, the child was admitted to the U.S. as an immigrant for permanent residence, and the adoption is final.If your child immigrated to the U.S. under a IH-3 visa, U.S. citizenship is automatic as of the date you enter the U.S. You do not have to complete any additional forms to receive their Certificate of Citizenship from the USCIS, it will automatically be mailed to you.
If your child immigrated to the U.S. under a IH-4 or IR-4 visa, U.S. citizenship is automatic as of the date their adoption is finalized in the U.S. and you can get an official Certificate of Citizenship from the USCIS using form N-600.Note there is a $1170 fee to obtain this certificate.
Once your child has obtained U.S. citizenship, you can apply to get them a social security number (SSN) and a U.S. passport (if needed).

, The American Academy of Pediatrics has the Council for Foster Care, Adoption and Kinship Care (COFCAKC) specifically designed to help the parents of these children with their medical needs. Use their website to search for an adoption medical specialist in your state. While there aren’t a large number of them, there is usually one in each major city of the state. Due to their experience and expertise, it is highly recommended that you take your child to one of these doctors, at the very least for an initial examination.


The COFCAKC’s website also offers a large number of resources about adoption, specifically from the medical perspective, that you may find useful based on the specific needs of your child., This visit is similar to the home study done before the adoption took place, however it includes observations of your family with your adopted child.A report must be completed and sent to the Chinese government 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years after the adoption. The CCAA allows self-reporting for the final three reports.Your adoption agency will assist you with these reports and help you file them with the CCAA at the appropriate times.

This adoption will legally remove one of the child's biological parents from his/her life, give him/her a new name, and transform his/her stepparent into his/her legal mom or dad. This is a huge change psychologically for the child. For the biological parent, it means agreeing to give legal rights to the child over to a new spouse.


Consider sessions with a family counselor. This helps to make sure everyone understands what a stepparent adoption means to the family, and helps ensure it's what the child wants.;
, A stepparent adoption has permanent legal consequences for the biological parent, the adopting parent, and the child.You need to understand and accept them. Consult with an attorney if you have any questions.


The biological parent needs to know that this adoption makes your current spouse the child's legal parent. If you divorce, your spouse has the right to visitation and even custody. If you remarry again and want the new spouse to adopt your child, you will be seeking the consent of the adoptive parent, not the biological parent.
The adopting parent takes on all legal rights and responsibilities of parenthood. If you divorce, you will be required to pay child support for your adopted stepchild. Your adopted child gains the right to a share of your estate, even if that lessens the share that goes to your biological children.
The child forfeits all claims to inheritance from previous family. The absent parent, grandparents, and other relatives of the parent who gave up rights in the adoption may make voluntary gifts to the child, but there is no standing to contest a will or claim a statutory share of the estate.

, At a minimum you will need a certified copy of the child's birth certificate, your marriage documents, and the biological parents' divorce documents (if they were married.) If the absent parent is deceased, you should get a certified copy of the death certificate.


If the non-custodial parent is living, you will need an address for service of the petition. If you don't have an address, you need to make honest efforts to find it. The minimum efforts the court will expect include Internet searches, contacting his/her family, looking in phone directories, and reaching out to former friends. Document these efforts in a journal so you will remember them.

, When you become an adoptive parent, you may gain rights in the child's property. This can include Social Security payments, military survivor benefits, trust funds gained through inheritance, awards in lawsuits, land or other tangible property that belongs to the child. This must be declared in the adoption petition.

, If the absent parent is willing to consent to the adoption or is deceased, the stepchild adoption procedure is fairly straightforward, and you may be able to do it yourself. If the other parent won't consent, consider consulting with a family law attorney before you file the adoption.

, There will be a filing fee to apply to the court to adopt your stepchild. Those fees may be nominal (as low as $20 in California), to over $300 in Texas. Payment will be required at the time you file the petition. Other costs could include an adoption home study, attorney's fees for the child's attorney, criminal history checks, court-mandated counseling, and fees for a new birth certificate. Although it varies per state, in total, it typically costs $1500-$2500 to adopt a stepchild, even if you have the other parent's consent, and even if you don't use a lawyer (because one will often be appointed for the child).All courts have a process for waiving some or all of the filing fees. It is dependent on your family income and assets. Ask the court clerk for the procedure in your local court.

, The petition is the legal document you will file with the court requesting the judge to allow you to adopt your stepchild. If there is more than one child, you can adopt them all at once with the same petition. An adoption petition is a precise document that must be tailored to your state. Missing a detail or not using the right forms can cause problems for you and the child later on. Therefore, it's not recommended that you write your own from scratch unless you have legal training. There are several options for the preparation of your adoption petition.


Ask the court clerk if they have a fill-in-the-blanks stepparent adoption package. These forms will have been vetted for accuracy and accepted by the court before in adoptions. Expect the cost to be around $10.
Contact your local Legal Aid office to see if they have a do-it-yourself stepparent adoption package. The forms have been reviewed by an attorney and will comply with local requirements. Expect the cost to be from free-of-charge to under $10. Hire a local legal document preparation service or attorney who offers unbundled legal services. The cost can range from around $50 to $200 depending on the jurisdiction. This is a good option if you are petitioning the court for a stepparent adoption and you do not have the explicit consent of the absent parent.
Once complete, you will file your petition, with the fee, in the courthouse of the county where you have lived with the child for at least six months.You must file in your county of residence, even if another courthouse is closer.

, This can either be the easiest part of the adoption process or the hardest. Your adoption package will have a form the absent parent can sign and have notarized to indicate their consent. If (s)he is willing to sign, the adoption can usually proceed with no difficulty.


Once the adoption is complete, the non-custodial parent is freed from all further child support obligations. Past due support can still be collected, but no further support will accrue. If the other biological parent is deceased, this will be noted in the petition and a certified copy of the death certificate attached.

, There are two common scenarios where you can't get consent from the other parent. First, is that the absent parent is hostile toward the idea and refuses to consent. The second is when the absent parent is truly absent and you don't know how to contact him/her.


If you believe the adoption will be hostile and contested by the other parent, you should consult with an attorney before you proceed. A non-cooperative parent seriously complicates the procedure and may result in a trial. Unless you have specific legal training and experience, the trial could not only result in denial of your adoption, but a challenge to the custodial spouse's rights of custody.

, If you do not have contact information for the absent parent, there is an extra set of steps you will have to go through. It is highly recommended that you consult with an attorney to make sure you know your state's requirements for dealing with a non-involved and missing parent. State laws vary, and it is critical that you follow the law in your state. A good general rule is that if your child has not heard from his/her other parent for over a year, and there has been no financial support for over a year, then the court will grant your adoption.However, this is only a general rule. Local rules vary tremendously.
You should make a reasonable good faith effort to locate the other parent. Reach out to family and mutual friends. Search the Internet and phone directories. Some states have a ""putative parent directory,"" where people trying to locate their children register. Document your efforts. If the judge does not believe that you were diligent, the adoption will be delayed or even dismissed.

, If your efforts to locate the absent parent fail, you can ask the court for permission for service by publication. This means that the notice will be published in whatever newspaper is most local to the biological parent's last known address. After service by publication, you can proceed with the stepparent adoption. If your court does not have a prepared form for this request, consult an attorney, document preparation service, or local Legal Aid for help. Once the judge grants permission for publication, go to the newspaper in your county authorized to print legal notices. They will help you prepare the notice for the newspaper and give you proof of publication according to your state law. The fee will be around $100 and cannot be waived by the court. , After the service period has expired, there is usually a preliminary court hearing where the judge will review the documents, note any deficiencies, and schedule the next step in the adoption.


This is the absent parent's opportunity to appear. If (s)he does appear, you can either talk to him/her about consent or consider your next move if (s)he refuses. If the absent parent does not appear, you are not required to give him/her any further notice. You are also not required to make any further attempts to contact him/her unless explicitly ordered to by the judge.
Be sure to comply with any orders issued by the judge. If the court wants additional documentation or information, supply it as soon as possible without question. If the judge orders criminal background checks, you may be required to meet with a court officer and sign a release so they can get your information.

, While home studies are usually waived in stepparent adoptions, judges still have the authority to order them. Home studies are conducted by child protective services (or whatever that agency might be called in your state). Cooperate and put your family's best foot forward by welcoming the social worker into your home and answering all of his/her questions. The court has the discretion to order a criminal background check on the adopting parent. If the adopting parent has a record of charges involving child abuse or neglect, or his or her own history of back child support or abandonment, the court will be much more unlikely to grant the adoption.
The judge may or may not want to meet the children. This is completely up to the judge. Some judges do not allow young children in the courtroom at all. It is best to have child care arranged before the court hearing. Ask the judge if (s)he wants you to bring the children to the final hearing.
If your child is over a certain age--usually fourteen--then the judge will have to get his or her consent in order for adoption to proceed, as well.

, At this hearing, the judge will make his/her ruling on your stepparent adoption. This is also the last chance for the absent parent to appear. The judge will review the documents and ask you about your intent to adopt the child. (S)he will also ask your spouse if (s)he consents to your adoption of his/her child and changing the child's last name. If the children are present, the judge may talk to them. Upon signing of the order, you become the legal parent of your stepchild.


You may be scheduled during the regular court docket. Even though this is a joyous time for you, the court may have other business to conduct. Definitely don't bring a large group, cameras, balloons, or anything else that may interfere with court operations. Judges are not a group of people known for their joviality. Save the party for later.
Some courts schedule special ""adoption dockets"" that are more relaxed and festive. At these special settings, judges will usually allow photos and a party-like atmosphere.

, Upon receipt of the file-stamped adoption order you can file for a new birth certificate showing your child's adopted name and proceed with updating school and medical records..

Autistic individuals do often respond well to set schedules and may have some difficulties dealing with unexpected transitions or changes, but all autistic children are not alike. Knowing that a child is autistic is less important than knowing about their personality.;
, Spend some time observing the child, if possible - particularly if you are interacting with them often (as a teacher, professional, parent, relative, etc.). Get to know what helps and challenges them so that you can be prepared for difficult transitions.


Start the transition a little early so that it can go slowly, without rushing. They might want to take a little time to finish what they are doing and shift gears.Try giving a verbal notice beforehand, such as ""We're going to leave in 10 minutes. Start thinking about you want to bring in the car with you.""

, The child might not be allowed to skip the difficult transition, but you can provide some choices to give them power over the situation.


For example, ask, ""Do you want to clean up by yourself, or do you want help?"" or ""Next it's time for homework. Do you want to work in your room or at the kitchen table?""

, Hear their frustrations, validate their feelings, and explain that you understand. Help them to focus on upcoming enjoyable tasks, and provide reminders of the next time the preferred activity will be available.


For example, say, ""I know it's hard to stop playing with blocks, but next we get to eat a snack! You can play with blocks again afterwards."" Provide understanding without encouraging or reinforcing tantrums or other inappropriate behavior.
You can also mention why the next activity matters. For example, ""It's important to go to the grocery store, because that's where we get our food to eat. You can pick out something special when we go.""

, Remind the child that they haven't done anything wrong; you're just following the day's schedule. Try to be positive and get them excited about the next activity, and avoid connecting the idea of moving to a new task as anything related to what the child has done; if it wasn't a consequence for their actions, you should be clear that it wasn't, to avoid associating it with punishment.

, If the child responds well to other children, ask classmates or siblings to invite the child to do the next activity with them. Provide praise and encouragement for all the children involved. Avoid comparing or singling the child with autism out; instead make him or her part of the group and reinforce everybody's success.

, Use a lot of clear, positive praise when the child transitions calmly. After harder transitions, remind the child that he or she had a hard time but that everything is okay now, and he or she can do it calmly next time; don't blame the child or make him or her feel worse about the transition. Stay positive.

, Prepare the child for the day's activities at home or at school by writing out a schedule. You can either include the whole day's schedule, or you can focus on a few activities at a time and update the schedule as you go.


If he or she can read, use words on paper or a white board. If not, use photographs or pictures. If you want to use them multiple times, consider laminating them and adding Velcro to attach them to a numbered schedule strip. Experiment with different kinds of pictures and symbols to see what the child understands best. Try to use some pictures of the actual child doing the planned activities, if possible.











, Excitedly talk him or her through it. As much as possible, provide choices about the activities. If the child expresses dissatisfaction with any of the events, try to change the difficult parts, or if that isn't possible, explain why, using appropriate language. For those non-preferred activities, remind the child about the good parts (for example, the fun activity that comes afterwards, or the snack he or she can enjoy during it).

, Refer to it as you prepare for transitions. If it's a written schedule, have the child cross off the completed tasks. If you're using a reusable picture schedule, have the child remove the pictures corresponding to completed tasks.

, Experiment with how much time the child needs to prepare for transitions. Many children respond well to 10 minute, 5 minute, and 1 minute warnings. Try warning the child verbally and visually (by referring to the schedule). Use a timer (either a clock or a visual timer) to count down the time left on the given activity.


Timers come in many forms. Some kids respond well to just looking at a clock or seeing a stopwatch/countdown on a phone or cooking timer. Others will need a simpler warning system. You can use colored cards to warn for transitions (where green means ""you still have time,"" orange means ""we're almost done,"" and red means ""it's time to transition""). There are also special timers and smartphone apps available that represent passing time visually, using colors, shapes, or stoplight-like indicators.

, For children who might need more reminders about upcoming tasks during transitions, use a two-step schedule to supplement or replace the day's schedule. You can write this out on paper or use a laminated schedule card with Velcro-backed pictures. For example, it can read, ""First: Work Time, Then: Free Time"" with pictures that hold meaning for the child. Walk him or her through it verbally during transitions.

, If necessary, offer the child a reward for completing the transition (for example, a small treat, a few moments with a preferred toy, or tickles or hugs).


If the child has lots of difficulty with transitions, consider implementing a token system whereby he or she can earn tokens or stickers for transitioning calmly to new activities. When he or she earns a certain number of tokens, provide a preferred reward or activity, like a sweet treat, a fun prize, or free time alone.

Follow up to confirm enrollment of your child.",How to Add an Adopted Child to an Insurance Policy," If you already have a family plan, you can add your adopted child. However, if you have an individual plan, you'll need to upgrade to a family plan before you can add your adopted child.Health insurance companies have additional deadlines for changing your plan so that you can add a child. If you need to change your coverage type, this must be done well in advance of the date you plan to add the child.
Typically you must change your coverage type at least 30 days before you add the child. However, some groups require 60 days notice.;
, With the adoption of a child, you can add that child to your policy through a special enrollment period – meaning you don't have to wait until the next open enrollment period to add your child. However, you typically must do so within 30 days of the date of adoption or placement of adoption.If you have to change your coverage type, you need to figure out how that deadline works with the deadline for the special enrollment period.
For example, suppose you need to change your coverage from an individual plan to a family plan, and you want your adopted child to be covered from the date of adoption. You must change your plan 30 days before the date the child is placed with you. After that date, you'll have 30 days to add the child to your policy.
If you waited until the date of placement to change your plan, you would miss the special enrollment period deadline to add your child to your policy and have the child covered from the date of adoption.
Some heath insurance companies use the date any other coverage expired if that date is later than the date of adoption.
For example, if you adopted your child through the state, and the child had health coverage through a government program for a period of time, you can wait until the expiration of that coverage and still use a special enrollment period.

, You must notify your insurance company that you wish to add your newly adopted child. If your insurance is through your employer, you typically can get the assistance of someone in your human resources department.Since deadlines and requirements vary among insurance providers, it's important to speak with someone who handles your insurance policy as soon as possible.
If you purchased your policy yourself, you'll need to work with the insurance company directly. Call the general customer service number and follow the prompts to speak with an agent.

, Your employer or group administrator will let you know what information is required to prove that you are now the child's legal parent. The type of documentation you need may depend on the age of the child and other factors.If you adopted the child from birth, typically all you'll need to show your employer or group administrator is a copy of the birth certificate.
If the child is older, you must provide legal adoption documents, such as the adoption order entered by the court.

, Your health insurance company will have forms you need to fill out to add your adopted child to your insurance policy. Typically you'll need to provide the same kinds of information about the child as you did for yourself when you applied for the policy.In addition to an enrollment or change form, you also must submit a dependent verification, evidence of the adoption, and information about the premium you've been paying.
Your insurance company will determine how much you owe based on the premium you paid and the difference between that premium and your new premium with the child added.

, Once you've filled out your forms, you'll need to submit them before the deadline expires on the special enrollment period. If you delay, you'll have to wait until the next open enrollment period to add your adopted child.The deadlines for submitting your form differ among insurance providers, so you should check with your employer or group administrator when you get the forms to find out how long you have to submit them.
In some cases you may have up to a year after the date of adoption to submit your forms and have the child added to your policy. However, there are shorter deadlines if you want the child's coverage to begin on the date of adoption.

, After you've submitted your forms, your insurance company should send you information and an insurance card for your child. If you don't receive an insurance card within a few weeks, contact your employer or group administrator to find out if there's anything else you need to do.Keep in mind that if you applied for coverage to start on an earlier date than the date you applied, you'll have to pay the difference in premiums up to the current date before the change will be effective.
For example, if your child was placed in your care on August 1 and you submitted the forms to add that child to your health insurance on October 30, you would have to pay the difference in premiums for two months so the child's coverage would relate back to the date of adoption.

You should also ask for the name of the adoption agency that they worked with. Your ability to access adoption records will depend on the state that the adoption took place.


If you are a birth mother who is searching for a child, then you should go through your paperwork and locate what adoption agency you went through.;
, In many states, it is much easier to access non-identifying information than it is to access identifying information. Identifying information includes things like current or past names, addresses, and employment information. Getting identifying information is critical if you want to find your birth parents. Non-identifying information is helpful if you are curious about your race or ethnicity, or want medical information about your birth parents. Non-identifying information includes:Date and place of the adopted person’s birth
Age of the birth parents and general physical description such as eye and hair color
Race, ethnicity, religion, and medical history of the birth parents
Medical description of the child’s birth and of time in the hospital following birth
Education level of the birth parents at the time of adoption
The reason for the adoption
Existence of other children born to the birth parents

, To find out how to access adoption records, you will need to find the relevant state laws for the state in which the adoption occurred. You can find the laws by searching for “adoption” and then your state.


The Child Welfare Information Gateway has also created a summary of state laws, which is available at their website. These summaries are current as of 2013. Because states frequently update their laws, you should still perform a web search to make sure you have the most up-to-date statute.
Find the laws for the state in which the adoption occurred. Each state’s summary should tell you how to get non-identifying information as well as how to get identifying information.

, Each state places restrictions on who can access the different types of information about an adoption. These restrictions may be different depending upon whether you are asking for identifying or non-identifying information. Typically, access to non-identifying information is less restricted than identifying information. In Michigan, for example, access is limited in the following manner:Access to non-identifying information: typically, this information will be available to the adult adopted person, the adoptive parents, birth parents and siblings.
Access to identifying information: generally, access to this information is available to adult adopted person, the birth parents, and an adult genetic sibling.
Your state’s statute will clarify who can access information. Read the statute to see if you qualify.

, Many states have set up a process for biological families and adopted children to find each other. The most common processes are “mutual consent” registries and confidential intermediary programs. With a mutual consent registry, the child or family members may file affidavits indicating whether they consent or refuse to allow information to be released.Accordingly, if you are a child who submits a request to the registry, the office that maintains the registry searches for an affidavit from the birth mother granting consent to release her personal information. If she has filed that consent already, then her contact information will be released to you. If neither a consent nor refusal is on file, then some states simply choose not fill the request. Alternately, other states may contact the birth mother to check if she is willing to consent to or refuse the release of her identifying information.
With a confidential intermediary program, an intermediary is granted access to adoption records so that he or she can search for birth family members and ask for their consent for contact.If the birth family consents, then the contact information is released to the party seeking it.

, If your state has a registry, then you should register for it. You likely will have to contact your state’s Department of Human Services and ask about how to go about registering.


In Arkansas, for example, you will need to complete an Affidavit/Registration form, attend a one-hour counseling session, and pay a $20.00 fee. The Affidavit is available on the state’s Department of Human Services website.
An easy way to find your state’s mutual consent registry (if it has one) is by typing your state and “mutual consent registry” or “consent registry” into your favorite search engine.

, Some states require that parties seeking access to adoption records undergo mandatory counseling. The purpose of the counseling is to inform you of the possible consequences of seeking out information or contacting a birth family.States requiring counseling include Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas., If you cannot access your adoption records, then you might want to meet with an attorney to consider petitioning a court to release your records. An experienced family law attorney can help you put together a compelling case. To find a qualified family lawyer, visit your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program.


Some states may also require that you get a court order before a third-party intermediary will be appointed., You would start a lawsuit by filing a petition in court. In the petition, you must state why there is a compelling reason to disclose information about the adoption and why this reason outweighs maintaining confidentiality.Some states will have printed “fill in the blank forms” for you to use. In Texas, you can use an “Application for Access to Termination and Adoption Records,” which is available from the Texas Law Help website. You must fill out the form and sign in front of a notary before filing it with the court clerk.Keep a copy of any application or petition for your records., In some states, you may immediately be called in to see a judge.In other states, the agency may be afforded an opportunity to respond to your petition.


Be sure to arrive at the hearing early. Do not bring in any food or drinks and have your cell phone turned off.
You should also dress appropriately. Try to wear your “Sunday best” and make sure that all clothing is in good condition. If you have to come directly from work, be sure to mention that fact to the judge., At the hearing, you or your attorney should argue why you want or need the information. For example, you may need access to medical records or help establishing a genetic link to a disease. You must demonstrate your need by clear and convincing evidence.The judge may have questions for you. You should answer all questions honestly and respectfully, admitting if you don’t know something.Address the Judge as “Your Honor.”
If you are seeking release of adoption records for medical reasons, then be sure to go to court with the contact information of any doctor who has been treating you for a condition.

, If you are granted access to either your birth certificate or other adoption records, then you should have the judge’s order certified. You can seek a certified order from the clerk’s office.You may need the certified order to give to a third-party intermediary if the judge refuses to release the records directly to you."

Explain your family values.,
Set clear limits.,
Keep screens out of sight.,
Create a ticket system.,
Make the rules consistent across screens.",How to Get Your Children Away from TV1," Kids are less likely to push your limits when you thoroughly outline your reasons for reducing screen time. Let them know that, in your family, you place a higher value on family bonding, physical activity, and positive sources of entertainment. When you make it less about the negatives and more about the positives of reducing screen time, your children are more likely to comply., Once you’ve described your family’s viewpoint on screen time, it’s important to develop a clear game plan. You won’t be able to enforce your plan if you simply say, “Okay, kids, everyone needs to cut back on screen time.” Instead, be specific on what they can and cannot do.


You might say, “Kids, we’re starting a new plan to cut down on how much screen time everyone gets—me and your mother included. On weekdays, you guys have homework and after-school activities, so we think an hour of screen time is appropriate. On weekends, you can have two hours per day.”You may also want to go over what types of TV shows and media are acceptable in your household. If you are unsure, read reviews beforehand. Even better, promote bonding by watching family-friendly shows and movies together.

, As the old saying goes, “out of sight, out of mind.” If TV isn’t in their face all the time, they won’t feel as tempted to watch it. Place TVs in only a few common rooms or tuck them away in cabinets until they need to be used.There are many interesting ways to “hide” the TV. You can find systems that slide behind artwork or are pulled down from slots in bookshelves or entertainment centers.
In the case of other screens, it may help to store them in a cabinet when they aren't in use so that they aren't always within eyesight.

, To help your children transition into less TV time, develop a ticket system that clearly defines the amount of time they have for TV each day. For example, each ticket (worth 30 minutes of screen time) might go into a jar with each child’s name on it. They might be allowed two tickets per day during the weekdays and four on weekends.You can even use tickets as a way to manage conduct. For instance, maybe only one child helps you unpack the groceries from the car, so they get an extra ticket to spend that week. However, if a child gets in trouble at school or fights with a sibling, they might lose a ticket.

, TVs aren't the only screens children watch. Your child may also access television shows, movies, and games on their tablets, laptops and smart phones. Be consistent by extending your rules to cover all screens, which means limiting how often your children can use these devices, too.

Make sure your children understand that these guidelines refer to other devices, such as tablets and phones.
Some kids may use other screens to help with homework or other educational activities. If you approve of this use for screen time, set up parental controls that block their access to other sites during these times. One such control is the application, Screen Time, which lets you manage how much time your kids spend on phones and tablets."

Go on fun outings.,
Encourage creativity.,
Suggest physical activities.,
Read books.,
Play board games.",How to Get Your Children Away from TV2," When the whole family is having fun outside the home, kids won’t miss the TV. Plan exciting outdoor adventures in your local community, such as a treasure hunt in the park or a tour of a nearby museum.

, Make art supplies available to your children in a special place in your home. Let them have free reign of these materials to make crafts, paint, color, or write imaginative stories. On occasion, sit down together and do creative activities that involve the whole family. That way, kids will see these activities as fun rather than a sad replacement for television., You know how important regular exercise is for health and wellness. Counteract the couch potato syndrome by getting your kids up and moving. Take a Frisbee out into the yard. Lace up your trainers and walk to a nearby park. It may also be fun to run a kids’ “exercise boot camp” on the weekend.


Getting your children involved in sports at school or in the community is also a great way for them to stay active. Being active also lessens the amount of time they have to spend watching TV., Reading can be just as fun and vivid as watching a TV show or movie. Introduce your children to stories that help them escape from everyday stress into imaginary worlds. Load everyone into the car for a weekly visit to your local library.Make reading all the more interesting by telling your kids about the books you enjoyed as a kid. Try to find them in your library or online.

, Time spent with their parents and siblings is rich and enjoyable. Your kids will soon learn this as they spend more time away from TV. Another way to promote non-screen time is by scheduling a family game night. Take a vote on which board game to play and have at it.Make sure you select games that are appropriate for all of your children.

Reduce your own screen time.,
Remove the TV from the master bedroom.,
Turn off the screen when you’re not watching.,
Pursue interesting hobbies of your own.",How to Get Your Children Away from TV3," When it comes to inspiring your kids to develop healthy habits, it starts with you. Cut back on the amount of time you and your spouse watch TV and your kids won’t think it’s quite so unfair when you ask them to follow suit.It may be wise for both parents to sit down together and decide how much screen time is appropriate for the entire family.
Your ""screen time"" covers all devices, such as phones, tablets, and computers. Make sure you are reducing your time on all these devices to model healthy habits for your kids.

, It’ll look like you’re cheating if you have access to the TV at all times. If you want to really make things fair and square, remove the TV from all bedrooms, yours included. Screens (including tablets and laptops) should only be available in common areas like the kitchen or family room., For many families, TV is like the soundtrack to their lives. If the TV in your home pretty much never gets turned off, start turning it off once your program is over.


Aim to be more intentional about your TV use. Think about which programs you like the most and watch only those. Press the “Power” button afterwards.
The same goes for tablets and smartphones. Power these devices off when you are having family time or whenever you're not intentionally using them.

, The ultimate goal for most parents is to encourage their children to do more positive activities like hobbies or sports. Be a good role model by following your own guidelines. If you expect each child to get involved in some sort of activity, the parents should do the same.

Think about hobbies you used to enjoy when you were younger. You can try needlepoint, gardening, basketball, or painting.

"
Know what your teen is facing.,
Watch for evidence of behavioral problems.,
Communicate with others in his/her circles.,
Keep track of your teen's progress.,
Understand what constitutes a ""normal"" teenager.",How to Deal With Troubled Teens1," Being troubled can cover a wide range of issues, from the behavioral (drug use, sexual explorations, and criminal activity) to the mental (ego and self-esteem). Being aware of what the teen is dealing with is the first step in helping them recover.


Before you go investigating, try communicating honestly with your teen (or have someone else do the job for you). If they aren't willing to open up, you'll need to start putting the pieces together yourself.
Just about all teens are dealing with many issues at the same time, which creates even more stress.;
, These include falling school grades, lack of interest in hobbies they previously enjoyed and suspicious activities.


Though these are just symptoms of a greater cause, keeping alert will help you piece the puzzle together and help you get to know your son/daughter better. Take every opportunity to gauge information and keep notes to stay mentally organized.

, Your neighbors and parents of your teen's friends are a good place to start. This gives you a broader view of the situation in your teen's sphere of influence with his/her peers.


In addition to being valuable resources of information, it's likely that they've been there too and can be a source of support. Don't be afraid to open up about your concerns - you're trying to be an involved, caring parent.
Don't ask them to divulge secrets or overly personal information, unless you have a good reason to believe they are contributing to your teens stress. Doing so will breach your teen's privacy and can only make the path to recovery even harder.

, Not all teens are going to be excellent students, nor will they all begin dating at the same age. But knowing what track they are on will help you better predict the future.


Certain facts are not necessarily indicators of trouble or rebellion. But as a parent, you should develop a familiarity of your teen's growth, both mentally and physically.

, Sometimes signs of trouble may just be signs of growth. All teenagers go through changes in dealing with growing up.


Keeping up with fashion is important to many teens. This may mean that your teen suddenly decides to dress provocatively or dye their hair. For some, this is normal behavior. Limit your criticism to bigger issues.

A changing appearance is not a red flag unless you suspect self-harm or see serious weight gain or loss.


As teens mature, they can become more argumentative and rebellious. Red flags include skipping school, getting into fights and violence on any level at home. These go beyond the norm of teenage rebellion.
Mood swings are normal. They may be irritable one moment and jumping for joy the next. What you should be concerned with is persistent sadness, anxiety or sleep problems. These could be signs of depression or bullying.

"
Communicate your expectations for your child’s behavior clearly.,
Set realistic expectations.,
Follow your own rules.,
Keep your expectations consistent for every situation.,
Do not negotiate your expectations with your children.",How to Improve Your Child's Behavior1," Children need to know what you expect from them. Sit your child down in a quiet place and explain to him/her what kinds of behaviors you want to see, using clear detail.Focus on correcting one behavior at a time. Giving your child a long list of items for improvement can be overwhelming.


Tell him/her things like, “When you are at school, you need to listen to your teacher,” or you might say, “I do not want you to hit other children, even if they are mean to you.”;
, Set high expectations for your children, but not so high they are unreachable. You want your children to have to work and think about what you expect, but they should also be able to achieve what you are asking from them. Otherwise, they may feel like failures and suffer from reduced self-esteem.You should also make sure that your expectations are age-appropriate.Set an expectation like “I expect you to show up to class on time and be respectful to your teachers,” rather than “I expect you to be a straight-A student.”
Expecting your 4-year-old to never lose his/her temper is unrealistic. However, expecting him/her to control his/her temper and not hit other children is realistic.

, Children see what you do and will tend to copy your actions and behaviors. If they see you neglecting to follow an expectation you made, they will assume they can disregard it as well.Keep in mind that kids often learn by example. Therefore, if you yell instead of discussing things with them, then they will probably adopt this behavior. Or, if you do not show respect for authority figures, then your children might also demonstrate similar disrespect for their teachers, coaches, parents of their friends, or even you.

, Stay strong and do not change expectation for every different situation. Hold your children to the same standard whether they are going to school, church, or the grocery store. Refer back to your written list of expectations before every new event to ensure both you and your child know what is expected.


For example, if you have set a “no tantrums” policy, do not give in if your child throws a tantrum in the grocery store. Follow through with whatever consequences you have set. If you modify your expectation to get your child to stop the bad behavior, he/she will learn that he/she can push your limits by misbehaving.
Consistency builds trust between you and your child. It will help frame you as reliable, and strengthen the bond between the two of you.
Consistency will also help reduce the “guessing” your child might feel about how to behave in certain situations, making them more secure and likely to behave better.

, You are the parent, so you must set and stick to the rules you make. If your child argues with you, remind him/her that what is expected of him/her has been laid out, and he/she is responsible for upholding what you have discussed.For example, if you have set the expectation that your child must finish his/her homework before he/she is able to play his/her video game, you should not let him try to negotiate his/her way out of doing his/her homework.
If you give into negotiating with your children, you immediately stop being consistent. If your children realize they can negotiate with you about what is expected of them, they will not take you or the behavioral expectations seriously.
However, it’s also important to pay attention to the situation. For example, if your son is arguing about not brushing his/her teeth, ask him/her why he/she doesn’t want to. You might find out that he has a loose tooth that hurts when he/she brushes it. Many children argue when they don’t know how else to express their feelings, especially feelings of pain or frustration.Also, keep in mind that negotiation can be a positive thing when your children get older. It can improve communication between you and your teen and make it easier to understand each other. Allowing your teen to negotiate with you can also promote critical thinking and diplomacy, and it does not mean that you have to give in, just that you have to be willing to listen.

Be on your teen's side.,
Support positive influences in their life.,
Seek professional help, if necessary.",How to Deal With Troubled Teens2," Communicate openly with them, and let them know you care about them and are interested in what is going on in their life.


All people, especially teens, need to feel loved. Regardless of how independent or averse to you they seem, they still need positive, reassuring attention from you.

, If they are involved in sports, clubs, or other positive activities, be supportive of them so they can be as successful as possible in what they are doing. Knowing they have a fan will encourage them to pursue these positive goals.


You may need to be rather obvious with your support. In research, teens often misread facial expressions; when shown pictures of adult faces expressing different emotions, teens most often interpreted them as being angry. This is because teens use a different part of their brain to identify emotion.

, Your teen may have trouble having you as an outlet but a certified therapist can be a healthy alternative.


Consult your spouse or a close family member for their opinion. If therapy seems necessary, talk to your son/daughter first. If they are opposed, make clear the benefits of therapy and explain that there are no stigmas attached - in fact, no one will have to know.

Choose a therapist that specializes in teenagers with troubling issues. Each therapist has a specialty and doing your research beforehand will maximize the possible effectiveness of your child's therapy.

"
Set boundaries for your teen.,
Establish clear consequences.,
Talk to your teen's teachers or guidance counselor.,
Grant your teen space.,
Give them responsibility.,
Get them active in the family.",How to Deal With Troubled Teens3," A curfew isn't mandatory but many teens actually do better when they know what time they should be home. Putting limits on where they can go and what they can do will help them recognize that their behavior does matter.


Be reasonable and reward good behavior. If your teen is hanging out with friends you know and calls to check in, relax. They are giving you a reason to trust them; show them you recognize and appreciate their good behavior.
Explain your reasoning behind each rule. This will let your teen know that rules aren't just in place to make them unhappy. If you can't think of a good reason, chances are that rule should not be put in place.

, Saying, ""You're grounded!"" is no good if they are out and about the next night. Make sure your imposed boundaries have a reason to be obliged by.


Stick with it. It may be hard at first, but having a routine allows both of you to know what to expect. Your teen will know the consequences of his/her actions without you having to explain them outright.

, If you suspect a school problem is evolving, they may be privy to information you are not.


Teachers will be happy to keep your meeting confidential. Putting a bug in their ear that your child's behavior may be on a slippery slope is not embarrassing; teachers are there to help and may be unaware of any problems at home.

, They need all the time in their world to find out who they want to become. Holing themselves up in their bedrooms may not be the worst thing. Allow them their time.


This is especially necessary if your teen is prone to anger. They need time to cool off. Demanding apologies while they are still raging will only escalate the situation.

, This can be in any way you deem appropriate. Give them a list of chores or ask them to help around the community for their allowance.


Encourage them to get a part time job. If they don't seek one out themselves, ask around your area for potential employers or neighbors who need jobs done.

, Make sure you're active first! Make family dinners and game nights a regular event. Letting your child know they are a part of the family and matter will make them feel culpable for their actions.


Set a good example. If you're constantly online and emailing at the dinner table, they'll have no reason not to mirror your behavior. If you expect them to be involved, be involved yourself.

"
"
Manage your emotions.,
Take time to relax.,
Stay positive.",How to Deal With Troubled Teens4," You can't help your teen if you often come across as angry, suffocating or unreasonable. You're seeking change - letting your emotions take over your logic may exacerbate the problem.


Remove yourself from the parent/child relationship. They aren't going to listen to you just because you're their elder. Think of how you would treat the situation if they were your equal. How would you try to get through to them? Staying level-headed will help you think clearly and make the best decisions.

, If you are losing sleep over this, you're not in the best shape to conquer these issues. At the end of the day, it's your teen who needs to overcome this, not you.


Don't feel guilty for taking time to yourself. It's important to rejuvenate and energize yourself before you try to take on topics that are exhausting. If you're beat down, it'll show. You'll become more easily exasperated and more likely to give up. Your teen needs you to stick with them. Take the time to be able to do just that.

, You may be making a mountain out of a molehill. What were your teenage years like? Your friends' and family's? Most acts of rebellion come in phases. Though you should take your son/daughter seriously and address the issues at hand, knowing that ""this too shall pass"" will be incredibly beneficial to your overall stress and ability to cope.


Happiness is contagious. If your teen sees that you're overwhelmed, exhausted and bitter, there will be no example for them to follow. They are still at an age where they need someone to copy; you can be that person.

Be proactive!,
Listen to your child.,
Talk to your children about their feelings.,
Make a plan for the next time your child feels this way.,
Explain why you have rules.,
Follow through and do not give empty promises.,
Empower your children by giving them choices.,
Teach positive behaviors in lieu of negative ones to obtain the same result.,
Reward good behavior.",How to Improve Your Child's Behavior2," Preventing bad behavior before it even begins is critical. Learn the patterns of your child’s behavior so you can be prepared to take action. For example, if you know your child is going to call for your attention during an important phone call, engage her in a puzzle or a TV show that will hold her attention for the duration of your call.Be clear with your child, telling her exactly what is going to happen. For example, before your phone call, say something like “Mommy will be on the phone for ten minutes. I need you not to interrupt me. I have put in your Ice Age DVD and have some yummy apples for you. When I am done on the phone, I will come cuddle and snack with you!”
If you know that your child tends to act out when he/she is sleepy or hungry, make sure that he/she has enough snacks and gets a good night’s sleep.

, Good communication is the single most important tool in your parenting toolbox. When your child misbehaves, take the time to ask your child what happened, and listen to her when he/she explains.For example, say your son/daughter has hit his/her friend. Ask him/her what happened. You might discover that he/she hit his/her friend because the friend wouldn’t share a toy, or because he/she is hungry or sleepy and not able to express those feelings appropriately.
Restate what your child has told you. This is an active listening technique, and modeling it for your children will help develop their communication skills.For example, you could say, “I’m hearing you say that you felt angry that your friend wouldn’t share. Is that right?”

, Once you have listened, take the opportunity to point out areas for growth in your child’s behavior.For example, you might tell your son/daughter, “You were feeling angry because your friend wouldn’t share. It isn’t fun to feel upset, is it?” When he/she agrees, you can follow up with “When you hit your friend, it made him/her feel upset, too. Do you think he/she likes feeling upset?” This type of dialogue will encourage your child to think about how others feel and the consequences of her actions.

, It’s important to help your kids make a plan for what to do when they experience emotions that upset them and could lead to acting out. This type of behavior plan is often used for children with ADHD, but it’s a good idea for all children.For example, you and your son/daughter could come up with a plan that includes the following steps for the next time he/she feels upset:


Take a few deep breaths.
Spend some time in another room to calm down.
Explain what made him/her upset.
Work out the solution to his/her problem with a parent, or between his/her sibling or friends.

, Often, children will act out because they don’t understand why they are supposed to follow the rules and expectations you have set. Explain to your child exactly why he/she has to follow the rule you have set him/her.


For example, if your son/daughter throws his/her toys around, you could tell him/her: “We have a rule that you can’t throw your toys. Throwing your toys could break them or hurt someone. It’s dangerous, and that’s why you are not allowed to do it.”
Try reminding your child about the “why” the first time or two he/she breaks the rule. For example, if you see your son/daughter throwing his/her toy, ask him/her, “Why do we have the rule about not throwing toys?” This will encourage him/her to remember why he/she is not permitted to throw toys.

, Following through with your words and fulfilling your promises begins to establish trust and respect for you as a parent. If you tell your child you will cuddle with him/her, make sure to do so. Otherwise, your child will not trust you and will be more likely to act out and “call your bluff”.Children are smart and will remember what you say. They will also try to push the boundaries. You must stay true to your convictions and set limits for your children.
You also must follow through when you are correcting bad behaviors. If you tell your child that you will take away his/her toys if he continues to throw them, then be sure to take them away if the bad behavior continues, regardless of your child’s inevitable protests.

, Try giving the power to your child by giving him/her options in a situation. Be strategic in the options you provide him/her by making both options acceptable behaviors. For example, say something like, “You can either get dressed for school right now or eat breakfast first.” Either way, they are doing what you want in a way you deem acceptable.Try offering your children extreme options that give them no choice but to behave. For example, “You can choose to stay here with your friend but share and be nice, or you can choose to leave.” This way the child is forced to behave well if he/she wants to continue to have fun.

, Your child is likely throwing toys while you are on a call to get attention. If you teach your child to instead ask nicely and wait patiently for attention, he will get the same result while behaving appropriately.


If you are asking your child to wait a few more minutes before he/she will receive attention, try using a timer to give both of you a concrete idea of how long until the child gets what you promised.

, Children seek and need attention, and will look for it in both positive and negative ways. Providing positive reinforcement helps your child learn what they are doing well, and makes them want to repeat that good behavior.Be very specific in your praises, by saying things like “Great job cleaning your room like I asked. Thank you!” or “That was really wonderful how you shared your toys with your friends."" Or, you can also try subtle positive reinforcement with smiles, nods, and hugs.

"
"
Lay out the consequences of bad behaviors up-front.,
Explain why your child is receiving a consequence.,
Offer a choice of tangible rewards when your child engages in desired behavior.,
Make consequences short to maximize their effectiveness.,
Be consistent.",How to Improve Your Child's Behavior3," When you describe your expectations for good behavior, also describe the consequences for disobeying the expectation. This way, your child can choose how to behave while knowing exactly what will happen. For example, say something like “I expect you to hold my hand when we cross the street, and if you don’t you will have to spend ten minutes in time-out."" This will cause your child to think more deeply before he/she engages in bad behaviors.Make each consequence short and easy to understand to increase the likelihood of your child remembering them. For example, “No iPad today,” “No Sesame Street today,” or “30 minutes deducted from your computer time today.”

, When you implement a consequence, make sure your child knows why he/she is being punished. Clearly explain to him/her that you have discussed with him/her what is expected, he/she disobeyed you, so now he/she has to face the consequence. By clearly explaining the consequences, there is no room for confusion about what behavior was incorrect, and you will both be on the same page.Try saying something like, “We both agreed that you would not hit other children when they don’t share their toys. Because you hit your friend, you will not get to play your video game tonight.”

, Positive reinforcement is the most effective consequence. When your child behaves in a way that you approve, offer him/her a piece of candy, an extra ten minutes on the playground, or a sticker.You can try “big” rewards if your child is especially well behaved for an extended period of time such as having a sleepover, getting ice cream, or choosing one item from the toy store.
Reward don’t bribe! Rewarding occurs after a behavior is complete, while bribes occur before the fact. If you are bribing your child to behave well, he/she may become confused and think he/she only has to behave well when he/she gets paid.
Ensure your reward suits the behavior. Offering a sticker for sitting through church quietly is acceptable. But offering a sticker for not hitting a schoolmate might not be a grand enough reward. Adapt and adjust to each situation.

, Children can often be forgetful and therefore, if you make a certain consequence last too long, they might forget why they are being punished. For example, if you take your child’s toys away because he/she was throwing them, do so only for a few hours or a day, not for a week or a month.In addition, long-term consequences might lead to increased bad behaviors. For example, if you ground your child for two months, he might think “Why should I behave? I’m already grounded”.
Always try talking to your child first to find out what is going on. Punishment should be used as a last resort.

, Choosing to institute consequences when it is convenient for you is confusing and undermines your authority as a parent. By not being consistent, your child might also become confused as to when bad behaviors will be faced with a consequence, and this will likely lead to worsened behaviors."

Remain calm enough to handle the tantrum properly.,
Make sure the child has what he or she needs.,
Ask what’s wrong.,
Give clear explanations instead of just saying “no.” Many parents just say “no” and “because I said so” instead of explaining the reason why, but that’s frustrating for kids.,
Offer your child a choice of coping strategies.,
Hold your ground.,
Take steps to prevent injury.,
Don’t lose your own temper.,
Help your child feel loved no matter what.",How to Handle Your Child's Temper Tantrum1," The worst thing parents can do is have a temper tantrum over their child's temper tantrum. Children need a calming influence, especially during a tantrum, and if you can’t provide that, you can’t expect them to calm down. Take a few deep breaths and wait at least a few seconds before deciding on a response.;
, Remember that your child's tantrum is not necessarily a way to ""get his/her way"", but could be the result of frustration, lack of needed attention from you, or even a physical problem, like low blood sugar, pain or digestive problems. Maybe your child is teething, has a dirty diaper, or needs a nap. In cases like these, don’t try to negotiate with the child, but simply provide what is needed and the tantrum will subside.


It’s very common for kids to throw tantrums when they’re sleepy. A regularly-scheduled naptime can help prevent recurring tantrums if this seems to be the problem.
When you’re out and about with your child, have a healthy snack available at all times, so he or she doesn’t end up throwing a tantrum out of hunger.

, Kids just want to be heard, and throwing a tantrum is often the best way they know how to express themselves. Taking your child seriously by asking what’s wrong and actually listening to the response can help. Hold your child and give him or her your full attention so he or she has time to explain.


This is not to say that you need to give in to whatever your child wants. The point is simply to hear your child out in a respectful way, just as you would anyone else. Whether your child wants a new toy or doesn’t want to go to school, he or she should have the right to express that.

, You don’t have to give a long-winded explanation, but providing a reason for your actions will help the child make sense of things and feel more in control of the situation.


For example, if you’re in the grocery store and your child throws a tantrum because he/she wants sugary cereal, remind him/her that he/she likes oatmeal and fruit for breakfast, so there’s no need to buy cereal, too.

, For example, your son/daughter wants ice cream, but it's too close to dinner. Say: ""Johnny/Alexis, you're really getting upset now. Calm down or you'll have to go to your room."" You have given him/her a choice: either control himself or, if he can't, retreat to a place where he/she won't influence others. If he/she makes the right choice (to calm down), remember to compliment him/her: ""You asked for ice cream and I said no. I want to thank you for taking no for an answer.""


Conversely, have consequences and enforce them if he chooses to get upset. Guide him/her to his room and firmly insist that he remain there until he calms down, for example. This is easier with a two-year-old than with an eight-year-old, so the younger you begin the learning process the better.

, Be empathetic but firm when you talk with your child, and once you’ve given a calm explanation, don’t back down. Your child may or may not calm down right away, but he or she will remember that throwing a tantrum doesn’t lead to satisfactory results. Next time your child wants something, he or she will be less likely to throw a tantrum.

, Some children can become quite animated during a tantrum. If this occurs, remove dangerous objects from the child’s path or steer the child away from danger.


Try to avoid restraining a child during a tantrum, but sometimes this is necessary and comforting. Be gentle (do not use excessive force), but hold him or her firmly. Speak reassuringly to the child, especially if the tantrum is the result of disappointment, frustration, or unfamiliar surroundings.

, It’s important to model the behavior you want to see for your child. If you lose it and start yelling and throwing an adult-style tantrum of your own, your child will see this type of behavior as something that’s acceptable at your house. It’s not easy to do, but staying calm and collected is the best thing you can do for yourself and your child. Take a few minutes to cool off by yourself if you need to. Get your spouse or other responsible person to look after the child while you calm down. Put your child in his or her room with a gate in front of the door if necessary.


Do not spank or yell at your child. Losing control of yourself in this way will only make your child feel confused and scared of you. It won’t lead to a healthy and trusting relationship.
Modeling good ways to communicate and handle frustration within your relationship with your partner is also important. Avoid fighting in front of your child, or getting upset when you don’t get your way.

, Sometimes kids throw tantrums because they just want some extra love and attention. Withholding love is never a good policy when it comes to disciplining a child. No matter what, your child should know that you love him or her no matter what.


Avoid berating your child or saying “I’m so disappointed in you” when he or she throws a tantrum.
Hug your child and say “I love you,” even if you’re very frustrated with his or her behavior.

Use time out during a meltdown.,
Tell your child it’s “time out” or “quiet time”.,
Place him or her in a safe spot.,
Explain to the child that you will talk to him or her when he or she calms down.,
Have a talk when it's time.,
Be consistent.,
Try the journaling time out trick.",How to Handle Your Child's Temper Tantrum2," Avoid trying to reason with any child who is in the middle of a full-blown tantrum. Give him or her time to vent. Instead, give the child phrases to express the emotions that they are experiencing. Say phrases like, ""You must be really tired after such a long day,"" or, ""You must feel frustrated that you can't have what you want right now."" This not only will help the child verbalize this later, but shows empathy without having to give in. At this point, you may find that your best option is giving the child space until he or she calms down.

, If your toddler is having a complete meltdown, and there’s no way he or she will be responsive to a rational conversation, sometimes quiet time is the best method. Tell him or her it’s time to be quiet until he or she can calm down and feel better.


Remain calm yourself to model good behavior for your child.
Don’t use quiet time as a threat or punishment, but rather as a way to give your child space so he or she can calm down.

, The child’s bedroom or another safe place in the house where you feel comfortable leaving him or her alone for a little while is best. The spot should be free of distractions such as a computer, TV or handheld video game. Choose a quiet, peaceful place that the child associates with feeling calm.


Don’t lock the child in a room. This can be dangerous and will be interpreted as a punishment.

, This will help your child to understand that you are ignoring her because her behavior is unacceptable, not because you don’t care about her. When the child calms down, fulfill your part of the bargain by discussing the tantrum and the child’s concerns.

, When your child is no longer having a fit, have a conversation about what happened. Without berating your child or taking an accusatory tone, ask why he or she was upset. Provide a clear explanation of your side of the story.


It’s important not to treat your child as the enemy, even if you’re upset with him or her. Hug your child and speak lovingly even as you’re explaining that we can’t always get our way.

, Kids need structure in order to feel safe and in control of their lives. If they’re never sure what will happen if they behave a certain way, they’ll start acting out. Use “time out” or “quiet time” each time your child throws a tantrum. He or she will soon learn that screaming and kicking aren’t as effective as talking things through.

, If you don’t feel comfortable putting your child in a different room or spot, you can still facilitate a time out of sorts by shifting your attention elsewhere. When your child throws a tantrum, tell him or her you’re going to write about it. Take out a journal and write down what happened and how you feel. Ask your child to tell you how he or she feels so you can write that down, too. Your child will want to be involved in what you’re doing, and will soon forget to scream and cry.

See if you’re getting through to your child.,
See if the tantrums are related to an environmental factor.,
See if the tantrums persist as the child gets older.",How to Handle Your Child's Temper Tantrum3," Different children respond to different disciplinary methods. Try a few different things and see what seems to work. If your child keeps throwing tantrums no matter what you do, you might want to get outside assistance from a doctor or therapist, who can provide more ideas that suit the specific needs of your child.

, Certain environmental stimulants might be causing your child to have more tantrums than normal. Sometimes kids have a sensitivity to food (especially sugar), light, big crowds, music, or other factors that irritate them and cause them to break down in frustration.


Observe the times when your child has tantrums, and see if you think the tantrums are connected to something in the environment. Take away the stimulant and see if that helps.
Get professional advice if you’re having trouble figuring out what’s causing the tantrums.

, Most kids eventually outgrow throwing tantrums when they learn other effective forms of communication. If your child keeps throwing tantrums well past the toddler stage, there may be something going on that needs to be addressed. Consider taking your child to a doctor or therapist to see if there’s a deeper issue at hand.


Take your child to the doctor if tantrums are frequent or violent. If your child throws a tantrum multiple times a day, or if the tantrums are particularly violent and exhausting, it’s a good idea to have your child meet with a professional to find out if your child has a need that’s not being met. Violent, frequent tantrums may be a symptom of a developmental issue.

Some states are very lenient with who can become an officiant, but others require officiants to be a practicing minister with a congregation.
Some states will impose a fine for any marriages officiated illegally.;
, Some counties within a state have different requirements for wedding officiants than others, so it’s a good idea to find out what your county laws are as well.

, As the officiant of a wedding, it is your job to ensure the people getting married understand what the marriage license means. Thoroughly read through the marriage license and make sure you understand it enough to explain what it means.

, Being ordained means to be appointed as a member of clergy in a religious organization. This makes a person an official representative of the religious organization. Becoming ordained through a religious organization is an important part of becoming a wedding officiant, and it’s required by law in many states.Many religious organizations will ordain you online, and some will even do it free online. Make sure your state will recognize online ordinations before you choose this route.
Some jurisdictions will not recognize ordinations through certain religious organizations so check your local laws to ensure your ordination will be recognized.
If you want to perform weddings in multiple states, you may have to get ordained from several different organizations depending on the local laws in each state.

, Once you’ve picked the religious organization you want to be ordained through, you need to do the organization’s specific steps to become ordained. Sometimes it’s as easy as filling out a form online, but with others you may have to take a few classes or pay a small fee., Many religious organizations only require you to complete the initial process to become ordained and you’re ordained for life, but some require you to periodically update your information. Check to see if the religious organization you chose requires any updating, and if it does, keep up to date with it so you don’t end up performing any illegal ceremonies., The first thing to do to officiate a wedding is to sit down with the couple and find out what kind of ceremony they want. You should plan out the ceremony with the couple so that everyone is on the same page.


Does the couple want a long, traditional ceremony with readings from a religious text?
Would the couple rather have a secular ceremony without any religious elements?
Are there people the couple wants to include in the ceremony to sing songs, give readings, or participate in any way?

, As the officiant you’ll be giving a short speech as an introduction and speaking throughout the ceremony to keep it flowing smoothly. Talk to the couple and find out information about them to use in the ceremony.Find out how the two people met.
Learn what their favorite activities are and what their profession is.
See if there are any fun jokes between them, or if they share a unique experience.

, On the day of the ceremony, you will be performing it in front of an audience, so it’s a good idea to practice it before the wedding day to make sure things run smoothly. You should write out the ceremony to practice on your own what you’ll be saying, and you should also hold a rehearsal with everyone involved with the ceremony to walk through it unofficially one time.


The rehearsal is usually held at the site of the wedding.

, To make a business officiating weddings, you’ll need to name your business and register it with either your county clerk’s office or your state’s government depending on your state. Your business will be registered as your personal name unless you create a trade or DBA, doing business as, name when you register.Many people like to use their personal name as part of their business name. For example, you can name your business John Walker’s Wedding Services or Amy’s Wedding Officiants.

, Most wedding officiants charge by the hour for their services, but some will have an upcharge if they have to travel a long way for the ceremony. Typically wedding officiants charge between $50 to $100 per hour for their services depending on where they are working.Typically a wedding officiant will earn around $300 to $400 per wedding.
Officiants in bigger cities like New York can charge more than officiants in a small rural town.

, One way to gain customers is to collaborate with other wedding professionals so you can market a one stop shop for weddings. Find a photographer, videographer, florist, and possibly even a caterer to associate with, and offer couples an easy way to book many aspects of the wedding all at once. When you collaborate with other professionals, you gain the added benefit of all marketing your services together on everyone’s websites giving each person more exposure.

, One great way to market your services as a wedding officiant is to create a website. Most couples will use the internet to search for wedding professionals to contract with, so you want to make sure you have a site for them to find. You can easily build a website by purchasing a domain name and finding a website host that has a template builder. There are also other ways to advertise your new business.


Print business cards with your business name, phone number, and website on them to hand out to people. Keep several business cards on hand at all times because you never know when you’ll run into someone looking for a wedding officiant.
Add your business name to wedding databases.
Get a booth at a wedding trade show to hand out your business card and pamphlets about your services. Make sure you have a fun giveaway for the trade show visitors so they’ll remember you.
Contact wedding venues or wedding planning companies to see if you can keep flyers there or be promoted by them.

Pick a material for the frame that can signify the beauty and importance of the day such as silver, glass, or a finely polished wood.
Add a more thoughtful touch to your wedding gift and get the date of the wedding, a message of congratulations, or the couple’s names engraved onto the frame.;
, Arranging for a gift basket to be delivered to their home when they return from their honeymoon is a thoughtful wedding gift. You may not know them well, but ask someone that does what the couple’s likes and hobbies are and choose a basket based off of that.Examples of different gift basket themes include:


A picnic basket of wine, cheese and fruit.
A sweets basket complete with chocolates, dried fruit and assorted candy.
A his-and-hers spa basket containing lotions, soaps and body washes.

, Money is a great gift to give to someone you don’t know, especially if the bride and groom are planning for a big honeymoon or putting a down payment on a house. Buy a nice congratulatory card to slip the money or check inside, along with a thoughtful message.


Be aware of regional and cultural etiquette regarding wedding gifts of money. In some social circles, cash is the best gift; whereas in others, it is still considered taboo.If you know anyone going to the wedding that knows the bride or groom, ask them if they think cash or a check would be proper.

, A gift card is a good alternative to a cash gift. Try and find one for the store where the couple has their wedding registry to make the shopping easier for them."

Stay calm and use positive discipline.,
Distract and comfort a child who is very upset.",How to Deal With Unruly Children," Your first priority should be to create rules around the behaviors that are causing the most disruption or have potential risk for harm.If you are the main caregiver for the child, you can develop the rules on your own. If your child spends a great deal of time with another caregiver (another parent, grandparent, or paid caregiver), then work with that person on the rules.


Make sure that the rules you develop are clear and simple. For example, for a child who has trouble with physical aggression, the rule could simply be worded “no hitting.”;
, Children need help replacing an undesirable behavior with something new that will help them learn to control themselves. Depending on what behaviors you are working on, you can try one or more different alternatives.


Stop, think, choose. Stop the current activity, reflect on what you are thinking, and then consider consequences for yourself and others before you choose your next action.
Personal time-out. Leave the room and take a few minutes to calm down before you return to the situation.
Talk about how you feel. Tell a person you trust about how you are feeling by naming the feelings you are having and how the feelings are affecting you.
Deep breaths. Take several deep breaths to help you if you are overwhelmed by feelings., Put meaningful rewards in place for when the child follows the rules. The consequences you choose should be minor and should not involve spanking or hitting the child. Consequences should also be age-appropriate.

Positive reinforcement of good behavior is very powerful. Meaningful rewards don’t need to be expensive toys or outings. Spending time with a child playing a game she enjoys might be a very inspiring reward for a child. And praise from you is a very meaningful reward for every child.
When it comes to consequences, keep them minor. For older children, docking allowance or assigning an additional chore might be effective. For younger children, a brief time-out (no more than one minute for each year of the child’s age) would be more appropriate.

, You do not want the child to have any confusion about what the rules mean or what “counts” as breaking the rules. Focus on what you want the child to do instead of the bad behavior.

For example, tell your child that instead of hitting someone, you would like him to come to see you and tell you about feeling angry.
Try role-playing with your child using “real-life” situations you have the child become upset and exhibit the bad behavior.

, One way to help children understand how to behave is to show them by example. If you and your child have agreed that the best way to avoid hitting is to take a few minutes alone to calm down, then you can try doing this yourself in front of your child.

, If your child breaks a rule, always use the consequence, and move to the consequence right away. If you wait until later or only enforce the rule sometimes, you are much less likely to see a behavioral change in your child. Similarly, when children follow the rules by using the replacement behavior you have worked on together, you should make sure to reward and praise them immediately.Parents who do not enforce the rules consistently and quickly tend not to see change in their child.

, If your child spends weekends with another parent or after-schools with a caregiver, then communicate with that person about the system you have created with the child. Consistency across settings will help your child be more successful.

, Temper tantrums are normal, especially in young children. They can last for a few minutes or for hours and can be stressful for the child and the caregiver. A child having a tantrum might scream, yell, and cry, but might also roll around on the floor, run around the house, or pound on the wall with fists.


Temper tantrums can be caused by all sorts of things, from being tired or hungry to not knowing what words to use or having trouble doing something difficult., When your child does get into a tantrum, it’s important for you to stay calm. If you become upset, that will make the situation worse for both of you. Know that tantrums are common among children and that this will pass., Don’t give in to what the child wants. Doing so will teach your child that tantrums work, when what the child needs is to learn is how to recognize and express the feelings he is having. Arguing and yelling will not work either. Even though it can be frustrating to be around a child’s tantrum, arguing and yelling just create a power struggle. Being calm is best.

, When children, especially young children, have a tantrum, they can sometimes put themselves in danger. Make sure that your child is not going to hurt herself during the tantrum. Keep a close eye on the child.Make sure no one else gets hurt by the tantrum behavior, such as another child nearby.

, If the child is old enough to understand, then move over close to the child and calmly explain what you want the child to stop doing and how you would like the child to replace the negative behavior., If your child doesn’t seem to be able to stop, then you can move the child to a quiet calm space and tell the child to be quiet for one minute. Once the child has achieved one minute of silence, end the time out period., It is important for children to feel loved after they have had a tantrum. Stay calm and express your love for the child, while also praising the child for stopping the tantrum.

Remove whatever was causing the tantrum and give the child something easy to do. For example, if the tantrum came about after the child tried to color a difficult picture, remove that picture and choose something easier for the child to work on., Learn about what situations cause your child to have a tantrum, and spend time with your child talking about how to recognize emotions. Be sure your child has toys that are age-appropriate, and keep meal and sleep times regular each day.

You can also talk with your child about expressing feelings through words or by letting out upset energy in a more positive way.

, If your child is prone to a tantrum when you are out, then don’t go out if your child is tired. Be sure that you have snacks with you as well. Include the child in what you are doing by talking with the child about what is happening. Help the child feel that he is participating actively in what you are doing – even if it is standing in a long lineup at the bank.

, Children, especially children five years old and under, are not always able to control their feelings or behaviours. Be prepared for misbehaving and meltdowns, and talk with the child’s primary caregivers (for example, a parent) about what to avoid, what rules the children are accustomed to, and how you should enforce the rules when their usual caregivers are not there.


It is important for children to have rules enforced consistently by everyone who takes care of them, including you. Find out what rules the child is expected to follow and how the parents would like you to handle breaking any rules., Children need to hear consistent messages about what is expected of them, and they need to see consistent outcomes when they break the rules. Otherwise, they become confused and will actually misbehave more often.


”Giving in” to a child’s demands, including things like eating too much candy or not going to bed on time, can upset parents and confuse children. Children might seem to respond positively to your permissiveness in the beginning, but their behavior will go downhill quickly if you don’t use good boundaries based on parents’ guidelines., Boredom is a common cause of misbehavior, so if you are taking care of children for someone else, be sure to spend time with them doing something fun and interesting. Keep children busy and they are less likely to become unruly.If you can, find out in advance what the child enjoys doing. Arts and crafts projects, games, or playing with favorite toys can all be engaging activities for children.

, Hunger and tiredness can also be the root cause of unruly behavior. Make sure you have appropriate snacks and meals on hand, and that you know nap schedules for younger children. Children behave better when they have had enough to eat and go to bed on time.

, If a child misbehaves, it is very important for you to stay calm, then to bend down so that you are on the child’s level. Tell the child – calmly – what is wrong with their behavior. Then tell the child what you would like them to do instead. Remember to use the rules and consequences you have discussed with the child’s parent(s).Never raise your voice or hit a child. Never shake or hit a baby in any way.

, If the child is beyond being reasoned with, then distraction and comfort are your next options. Hugs, favorite toys, teddy bears, snacks, or new activities are all things that you can try to help the child feel better."

The items on the registry are things that the bride and groom picked themselves so whatever you choose to buy will be a good gift.Look the registry over carefully and, if possible, take a copy with you when shopping. Avoid buying anything that duplicates the wedding registry.
Choose a gift that can fit many homes’ styles. if you can't use the registry to help you match the couple's style, then avoid gifts that are distinct in color or style. Stick to items that would match many color and style schemes.

, You may be able to find a gift that matches their interests. For example, if they like wine, you could buy them a wine rack or decanter. Matching their tastes can make for a thoughtful gift that the couple can really enjoy.

, If you are crafty or artistic, consider putting those skills to use in making a gift. If possible, ask someone that knows them if the newlyweds would appreciate a piece of art or a practical item you can craft. If they would, spend serious time and effort on your creation and make sure that it is not thrown together the night before. Some examples of created gifts include:

Ask friends and family about what is going on in their lives. Step away from the wedding by getting involved or at least asking about what friends and family members are doing. Support a friend who maybe attempting her first half marathon (or even consider training and joining her) and really listen to your friends when they want to talk about troubles or triumphs.
Make a pact with yourself to not try to weave your wedding into every discussion. Although you may be excited and/or anxiety ridden, remember that your wedding is not at the top of everyone’s minds. An occasional reference on what you need to do is o.k., however don’t try to take every opportunity to inject wedding information into each conversation.
Stay focused at work. Try to ignore wedding planning while you are at the office. Unless you have an appointment with your florist or wedding planner, leave wedding planning at home.

Redirect your attention to having the perfect marriage. The party/wedding is only one day. If that isn’t “perfect” why should you care? The point is to marry the person of your dreams so instead of obsessing over the cake or table settings, focus on the life you are about to enter.
Give up control. You hired people to handle certain aspects of your wedding. As you hand off these duties give yourself permission to be o.k. with these aspects not being exactly how you envisioned. Your day will be special no matter what so obsessively trying to control every aspect will but a damper on it.
Let your budget dictate your vision. Don’t go into debt (or push to go into debt) over a wedding. Before you start planning have a budget and let your budget tell you what you can and cannot afford.

Give your bridesmaids opportunities to make decisions. The horrible, unflattering bridesmaids dress should be banished and you should let your friends/family members select the dress that flatters their figure most. Consider selecting a color and allowing them to choose something off the rack (so they could wear it again in the future) or suggest they meet at the bridal store to select what they collectively like.
Plan relaxing lunches or outings with bridesmaids. Make it a time when you don’t even discuss the wedding or your impending marriage but instead make it a celebration of your kinship.
Find ways to laugh at the process. Having a good laugh at the entire process together will not only ease tension but create more of a bond. Consider hitting a comedy club or a rousing drag show to let down your hair and have fun with your BFFs.

, This is an extremely momentous occasion for mom and dad (not to mention your fiancé’s parents). If they have requests or want to invite certain people, let them. Honor your parent’s wishes as they send you off to form your own family.


Relieve some of the burden by allowing your parents to handle some of the wedding. If your parents want to be involved, let them. This will allow them to feel more part of the process and will take some of the stress off of your shoulders.
Let both your parents and your fiancé’s parents know that you understand that the wedding is stressful for them too. Not only if they are paying for the event, parents may feel stress because in some way they are losing their child. This is a very emotional time for parents so cut them some slack and let them be an important part of the wedding.

, Want to a one way ticket to bridezilla land? Go on a starvation or crazy diet! In order to take a more laid back approach to the wedding, you’ll need to nourish your body and mind. Avoid over eating but continue to adhere to a clean diet.


Avoid excessive drinking. Not only will drinking pack on the pounds, it could lead to erratic behavior. You may want to have a glass or wine or two to ease any mounting stress, but don’t go beyond a few drinks. Also, don't drink more than once every few weeks. Keep your wits about you and avoid hangovers (which can also add stress, especially if you need to be productive).
Eat a clean diet. Experts contend that eating a diet free of additives, preservatives and sodium can lend to a more Zen-like, happier individual. Ditch fast food or even dining out more than once a week and dine on fresh spinach salads, cooked kale, lean skinless chicken and fresh fruit.
Never take diet pills or aids to lose weight. Not only can they rev up your blood pressure and heartbeat, diet pills can actually make you feel stressed and anxiety ridden.

Whether you will need a suit or tux depends on the preferences of the groom and his bride-to-be. Some weddings do not require that all groomsmen match their attire. If that is the case, the groom will usually instead provide some rough guidelines like “gray and navy suits.”If the groom provides no advice for you, inquire with the groom as to what he would like you to wear.

While the actual organizational responsibilities of the rehearsal will be the groom’s, he might delegate certain things to you. For instance, if certain groomsmen weren’t able to attend the rehearsal, the groom might ask you to fill them in as to where they should sit and stand during the wedding.


Learn as much as you can about the plan for the wedding during the rehearsal. If any groomsmen forget their places, you can remind them of where to stand.Any ceremony that involves a lot of moving about, or ceremonies in which specific people like parents, bridesmaids, or groomsmen are meant to sit in certain locations requires a practice run. The rehearsal ensures that during the actual wedding, there are no snafus and everything goes according to plan.

, It also helps them get to know one another a bit before the actual wedding. Deliver a complimentary speech at the dinner in honor of the groom and bride. Celebrate their life and future together. Express your happiness for them both.


Keep the speech brief. You’ll want to deliver an even deeper, more moving speech at the actual wedding reception.
Keep a pen and notepad on hand during the rehearsal and dinner. If the bride and groom want to change anything about the venue, seating arrangements, or lighting, they might ask you to make these arrangements.
Assuming the rehearsal dinner is at the same place as the actual wedding reception, plan how and where you intend to take pictures at the wedding reception during the rehearsal dinner.

Keep the groom calm.Marriage is a serious life event.,
Ask the groom if he needs anything.,
Walk the maid of honor down the aisle.If, during the wedding rehearsal, you were asked to walk the maid of honor down the aisle, you should do so at the designated time.,
Take pictures of the wedding.,
Sign the marriage license.To complete the marriage license, two witness signatures are needed.",How to Be the Best Man3," The groom might understandably be nervous. Calm his wedding jitters in whatever way you can. Tell him, for example, “You’ve got nothing to worry about. You will do just fine.” If you’ve been married yourself, explain to the groom, “It’s normal to be nervous. I felt the same way before I got married.”


Do not let the groom consume alcohol or drugs to calm himself.

, Be available for last minute troubleshooting. For instance, perhaps some out-of-town guests need directions to the wedding hall. Perhaps the photographer needs to get paid. Whatever comes up, be ready to take it on.


Pack a portable sewing kit. If the groom, you, or anyone else involved in the wedding has a wardrobe malfunction, it helps to have some thread and needle on hand to salvage the situation.
If you’re tasked with holding the bride’s ring, keep the ring in your breast pocket or side pocket of your suit. Double-check your pocket to ensure it doesn’t have any holes. Then check the pocket again., This usually occurs after the bride and groom walk up the aisle, followed by the flower girl and ring bearer. Do not walk too fast when walking up the aisle. Keep pace with the maid of honor. Smile as you walk.


After you and the maid of honor walk up the aisle, you’ll be followed by the rest of the groomsmen and bridesmaids.

, A common best man duty is to take pictures of the wedding ceremony. Be sure to capture the bridesmaids, groomsmen, bride, groom, and assembled guests. Use a digital camera so you can easily distribute pictures after taking them, and can correct your camera settings if your initial exposures are not as good as you want them to be.If you do not feel comfortable photographing the wedding because you are not good with photography, tell the groom.He might choose to have someone else take photos, or obtain help from an additional photographer.

, The groom will likely rely on you to provide one of the signatures. Don’t rush off to the wedding reception too soon. Locate the officiant who married the couple (who must also sign the license) and sign the license.


Double check with the groom before the marriage to ensure they have brought the license with them.

"
"
Decorate the marriage vehicle.,
Deliver a toast in honor of the groom and bride.This speech should be a more robust version of the speech you gave at the reception.,
Ensure everyone has a good time.,
Carry out any special traditions expected of you.,
Take video and pictures of the wedding party.",How to Be the Best Man4," After the reception, many couples choose to exit in a special vehicle. Perhaps it’s a new car, a gift from the parents-in-law, or a fancy rental reserved for the occasion. Whatever the case, sneak out with the other groomsmen just before the wedding commences and decorate the car.


Write a simple declaration of the couple’s marriage on the hood or back window of the car with a bar of white soap or shaving cream. “Just Married” or “Just Hitched,”are acceptable options.
Don’t attach tin cans to the rear fender of the car. It is illegal in some places. Instead, tie pink and white streamers around it.
Don’t use materials that will damage the car like spray paint, whipped cream, or tape.Do not write or draw anything obscene or offensive on the vehicle.

, Keep it sincere and honest.If you don’t know the bride well, for instance, admit as much. But then follow up with the fact that your impression of her is that she is a great match for the groom. Don’t exaggerate, but do share how happy you are for the newlyweds.


Prepare your speech well in advance of the wedding day. Practice it every day for at least two weeks. Read it out loud to a test audience of a few friends and family at least once so you can gauge whether anything you say is confusing or inaccurate. Solicit feedback from your test audience and incorporate it into the final speech.
If you need notes while delivering your speech, feel free to use them.
Deliver your toast early so that you’re not too drunk by the time you deliver it.
Begin the speech by thanking everyone for coming. Compliment special individuals like the mother of the bride who might have had a hand in assisting with wedding planning.
Use a story to demonstrate one of your friend’s best qualities. If he is a thoughtful and generous person, use a story about, for instance, the time he brought everyone lunch after class because you’d all taken a tough test that day. Illustrate what a great person the groom is and how he deserves to have a wonderful life with his bride.
Avoid inside jokes, references to past relationships, and controversial topics like political or religious issues.

, Work the tables and mingle with the guests for at least a few minutes each.Check to make sure everyone has what they need. Ensure drunken family members or other guests do not behave inappropriately.


You might also need to organize guests for photos. Identify who or what the photographer or the newlyweds want in their photos.
When the event is finished, help wrap up. Collect wedding gifts and put them somewhere safe. If the groom wants his tuxedo returned before heading off on his honeymoon, offer to return it for him.

, For instance, it is a custom at many wedding that the best man dances with the bride.If this is expected of you, you should do so. Usually, you will dance with her after she has danced with the groom at least once. Have fun while dancing and ask the groom if he expects you to perform any other special traditions.

, Be sure to get members of both sides of the family in your shots. Ask leading questions like, “What do you want to say to the bride and groom?” Take candid shots of the bride and groom dancing, kissing, cutting the cake together, smiling, and having a good time. Get some exterior shots of the reception location before guests arrive, too, if the location is noteworthy.


Include photos of things other than people, too. For instance, menus, the cake, centerpieces, tables stacked with wedding gifts are all memorable things to photograph."

A wedding can have as few as one bridesmaid and as many as the bride can fit into the ceremony, such as a dozen or even more!;
, Your main duty is to help in the lead-up to the wedding; it's not just about wearing a lovely dress and looking pretty! There are lots of little things you can do, including running errands, addressing the envelopes for invitations, helping to ring up catering venues, etc. Choose to do the things that you're good at doing––the bride doesn't need someone asking her 101 questions every few minutes!


If you're good at event organizing, lend a hand in researching options for receptions if the bride hasn't a good idea yet.
Things like assembling favors and writing place cards can be an easy but extremely helpful task for you to do as bridesmaid.

, You don't have to do this but it's helpful for the bride. It's best if you plan it with the help of the other bridesmaids, as many hands make for light work.


This may also be known as the wedding shower or a wedding shower might be in addition to the hen's party. Find out what the bride's preferences are.

, The etiquette of this may vary from region to region but since you're going to be wearing, altering and keeping the dress, assume you should also pay for it, within reason. In some cases, the bride may insist on covering the cost of the dress but don't expect this as a matter of course. Some brides pay for the dress as a way of thanking their bridesmaids; in this case, accept graciously.


If the bride wants something unrealistic in terms of expense, such as a very expensive fabric or handwork done to the dress, then it is reasonable to expect the bride to cover the additional cost.
Junior bridesmaid's dresses are usually paid for by their parents.

, By all means explain to the bride what your preferences are and that you won't be caught dead in anything strapless or shoulder-revealing or whatever your religious, moral or personal preferences require. However, do not lecture the bride about how the color looks terrible on you, or how the dresses are frumpy, etc. There are always ways around the bride's choice, such as different, more flattering shades of the hue she wants and slight style changes that flatter your figure better and none of these things should be cause for argument with the bride.


It is commonplace nowadays for the bride to choose the color and a general style (long, short) and then to leave the individual styling arrangements to the bridesmaids. It all depends on how ""hands-on"" the bride is about the precise styling.

, You might be given the role of collecting the bouquets from the florist on the day of the wedding if they're not being directly delivered.

, Usually this will be at her home initially, then at the wedding venue and reception venue. Help her dress, put on makeup, do her hair, etc. if requested. If not, she may simply like your company as she is getting ready for the ceremony.


Find out if the bride is having pre-wedding photos. If so, it is customary for bridesmaids to be included. You may be photographed at any time in the lead-up to the wedding, for the bride's recollection afterward, so be on your best behaviour.

, Usually the bridesmaids enter before the bride and then are arranged at the bride's side during the ceremony. There may be alterations to this depending on the space and the bride's preferences.


When the ceremony is completed, bridesmaids should wait until the bride and groom have left and follow behind either as a group or accompanied by the groomsmen.

, It is important that everyone supporting the bride and groom attend the rehearsals and know what it is expected of them.

, This is also up to the bride and groom but if you're wanted in the receiving line, then be prepared. Another alternative is to have you circulating the room as guests arrive.


You may be asked to help display the gifts at the reception, including arranging them to show them at their best.

, In some cases, there may be insufficient room or you may be considered too junior in the line-up to share the head table space. Whatever happens, keep in the spirit of the event and appreciate the chance to be a bridesmaid.

, With the bride usually going on a honeymoon, you might be asked to get the wedding dress dry cleaned and safely returned to her (new) home and to take care of the wedding gifts. You may be sharing such tasks with other bridesmaids or family members, depending on the preferences of the bride. Offer your help all the same.

Revealing your cleavage would be considered rude. For males, it is a suggestion to wear Batik and formal long pants. T-Shirt and anything jeans is a no. Too-casual wear will be frowned upon.;
, The receptionist will give you the wedding favor. And then follow the red carpet.

, The married couple will stand together side by side at a big stage-like called ‘pelaminan’ which will be decorated depends on the couple’s origins. Some people might already queuing there to give their ‘congrats’ to the couple.

, Go down from the right side of the ‘pelaminan’. Just follow the flow if you're confused.

, Usually the party endures for around two hours. But if you come after the party for at least an hour, you might find yourself out of food. If you come on time, you might see some interesting traditional wedding procession.

Consider your motivations.,
Meet with the bride and groom privately to talk.,
Address your concerns one-on-one.,
Convince the couple to wait a year.,
Suggest a “fake” wedding.,
Call out the lies.,
Involve others.,
Follow the money.,
Void the marriage after the wedding.,
Wait for the marriage to fail down the road.,
Move on.",How to Stop a Wedding," Before attempting to stop a wedding you need to think about why you have decided to take this on. Ask yourself if you believe you have the best intentions for both individuals by stopping their wedding. Try to understand why the couple has decided to get married and if you may be the only person feeling otherwise.


Talk with family members or other people involved in the wedding to find out if someone else feels similarly.
If you want to stop a wedding it's best to find legal reasons why it shouldn't happen.
Do not base halting a wedding purely off of emotions like jealousy or hatred. Those can be worked through with communication and therapy.;
, Go directly to the couple-to-be and calmly discuss why you believe their wedding should be stopped. If there are legal reasons they should not be married bring these up and show the facts.


Imagine how you would feel if someone tried to stop you from having your wedding. Go into your discussion with the couple thinking carefully about the words you use and your reasoning.
Make sure to stay calm and collected to get your point across in the best way.
Voice your concerns and why you feel so strongly opposed to the wedding, but also listen to them and hear their side.
Offer solutions if you bring up legal problems and it's more likely the couple will listen and cooperate.

, If you need to, ask to speak individually with the couple-to-be. This is beneficial if you don't think you can keep a cool head talking with them both at the same time. Discuss your concerns with them separately.


This may be a good time to ask questions about how they are feeling about the wedding, and what their future looks like in their eyes; why they believe their significant other is the one for them etc. That kind of discussion could bring up uncertainty they may have about getting married and you can use it to enable them to think a little more, and possibly call off the wedding.

, If you can't convince one or both of the lovebirds to call off the wedding, you can try getting them to hold off for a year.


The expense of a wedding is a great excuse to need to wait to save up more money.
Planning a wedding is a lot of time and effort. For some, schooling, athletics, or current hobbies may take up much of their time and you can use this as another excuse to wait.
Another excuse to hold off until another year would be family events coming up such as grandpa's 80th or the birth of a new baby. You could use these by saying how much nicer it may be to have a wedding when the celebration will be all about them.
If none of these are true, and you feel the couple actually isn't a good match, you can also tell them the truth if you think they will listen; you believe they should wait a year to see what comes of their relationship, and if they're still together and happy its testament of their bond and they can decide to get married then.

, Discuss holding a wedding celebration, but without the minister and paperwork. No one else has to know it's not legally binding and everyone can still enjoy themselves. This may satisfy a couple looking forward to the event and festivity but avoid any trouble later with divorce lawyers if it doesn't end well.

, If you know the wedding is a fraud, or there are legal reasons the wedding should not go through as planned, you have at least 28 days to take legal action. Couples must let a registrar know of their decision to get married and the registrar is required to make that information public for at least 28 days.Laws vary by jurisdiction, and each case is situation. Call or visit your local courthouse to discuss the steps you need to take once you have legal reasons the couple cannot get married.

, If you have a good reason to believe the wedding should be stopped it will help if you get others to feel the same way. If you feel it may be your only way to stop the wedding, share your research you've done with the family and friends of the couple to obtain a greater opposition. Use this pressure to divide the couple.


This should be done as a last resort as it could be very traumatic, or it could actually bring the couple closer together in their possible attempt to escape and elope.
Crashing a wedding is not advised. It is a dramatic and reputation-damaging route which may not even work since some couples are legally married by signing the marriage license before the wedding ceremony.
The recommended plan would be to talk way ahead of time with the couple to avoid expenses and chaos and to have a rational discussion where you all share your sides.

, If the couple are relying on both or one set of their parents to support the wedding, you may want to try to stop the money source so the wedding will be called off. If you have legal reasons, again, share this with the parents and let them know they may be financially supporting a harmful situation. If there aren't legal reasons you can still voice other concerns and attempt to stop the money flow.

, You can use an annulment to legally cancel-out the marriage as if it never happened.After the wedding one of the two newly weds can call for an annulment for several different reasons.


The marriage was with a minor and required approval from the court and/or parental consent.
The marriage was not consummated and neither spouse were able to have sexual relations.
Either spouse were mentally ill or mentally incapacitated; involved with drugs or drunk.
If the marriage was illegal based on incest
If the marriage was fraudulent; one spouse marrying the other based on lies.
If a spouse was forced or blackmailed into the marriage.
If either of the two were still married to someone else at the time of the wedding.If you know the wedding is going to happen on any of those pretenses then you may still be able to null out the marriage after the wedding. Talk with the person whom you believe should initiate the annulment and show them how they can escape the marriage.

, If the couple are fairly young and it's their first marriage there's a 40% chance the marriage will end in divorce.Waiting is not a fantastic solution since there may not actually be an end in sight. This should be your very last resort.
This could be a good plan if you believe the relationship is already particularly unstable.

, If you feel you've done all you can rationally do to stop the wedding without success, it's time to accept the inevitable. It may take time, but since you have no control over the couples' decisions, the best way to get over your opposition is to move forward with your life.

Clean the birdbath well, especially if this birdbath has been “used”. You will definitely want to remove debris or evidence of previous bird use before decorating. Use dish soap and water to scrub and clean. Allow to dry in the sun.
Consult with a restoration specialist if you are dealing with an antique or birdbath that needs touching up or repair.;
, Fill it ¾ of the way up since you will want to accommodate flowers and candles. Consider using filtered water or add a few drops of bleach to the water to avoid bacteria growth inside your birdbath.

Consider purchasing a number of different shades of one color or multiple colored flowers. Go with a similar theme instead of mixing pastel with bright colors.

, You will want to float the votives amongst the flower petals but not to overwhelm the birdbath or container. You may want to begin with only one or two votives (depending upon the size of your birdbath) and either add or subtract as you add petals.

, Like with the votives, scatter one handful of petals first, then allow them to set and then add the next handful. If you are using more than one shade or color consider alternating handfuls with different colors.

Make sure the agreement is fair to both people.,
Make the prenuptial agreement official.",How to Obtain a Prenuptial Agreement," Put simply, a prenuptial agreement is a legal contract that outlines what each person entering into a marriage has before the marriage is official, and what each person would take out of the marriage if it were to end due to either death or divorce.Normally these decisions are made by the state in which you live. However, a valid prenuptial agreement puts this decision in the hands of you and your partner., For example, if you make considerably more income, possess a greater amount of assets, or have significantly less debt than your partner, it may be in your best financial interest to get a prenuptial agreement before you and your partner are officially married.For example, if you will be receiving a large inheritance, a prenuptial agreement can help ensure you retain ownership of these assets instead of them being part of shared marital property.
Alternatively, if your partner is liable for a large debt, a prenuptial agreement can protect you from being subject to your partner's creditors.If you do not currently have any major financial assets, but expect to earn an increased amount of income during your marriage, or if you are pursuing an educational degree in a highly lucrative profession, you should still consider filing a prenuptial agreement.

, Prenuptial agreements can outline who will pay the expenses for children from previous marriages.Therefore, such an agreement can be useful in this situation to make clear who will be responsible for providing for such children, in addition to outlining how assets will be allocated in the event of death or divorce.


Be aware, however, that certain expenses—such as paying for college using federal financial aid—still require both parents to be financially involved regardless of the existence of a prenuptial agreement.

, A prenuptial agreement in this situation can serve two purposes. First, it can protect the assets of the person who owns the business in case the marriage ends. Second, it can protect the person who does not own the business from incurring any liability resulting from the operations of that business., Prenuptial agreements must be professionally drafted in order to ensure they do not run afoul of state law. Therefore, it is very important that you and your spouse each hire your own attorneys. If both parties are represented by the same attorney, it will be seen as a direct conflict of interest, which may affect the viability of your agreement.


To find an attorney ask friends and family for recommendations. If they do not have any recommendations, you should look at your state bar's website, which will often have a lawyer referral service or a list of qualified attorneys. When you are choosing an attorney, find one who specializes in marriages and prenuptial agreements.
Once you find some potential candidates, sit down with them for an initial consultation. During this consultation you should ask the attorney about their background and experience in dealing with prenuptial agreements. Make sure you feel comfortable with them representing you.
When you find the right attorney, hire them and make sure you get your fee arrangement in writing.

, Prenuptial agreements usually come down to money, so you and your partner should talk openly about your respective finances, and what will happen to each person's money and assets once the two of you are married. Even if you don't end up drafting an actual agreement, getting this information out in the open will provide a strong foundation of trust for your marriage going forward.


Be sure to touch on all the financial issues that may affect your future marriage, including: current assets and debts, credit ratings, shared expenses, whether you and your partner will maintain separate bank accounts, what you and your partner's financial goals are, whether one of you will stay at home with the children or if you will both work, etc.Try beginning the conversation with a financial issue both of you share: ""Hey, so I was looking over some bills today, and I realize I still have a ways to go in paying off my student loans. What do yours look like?""

, It is best to have this conversation well in advance of the marriage to give both you and your partner plenty of time to be honest with each other and reach an understanding in a calm, logical manner.Even if you're not sure if you want such an agreement, or you're not clear on the terms yet, it's important to let your partner know that it's on your mind.


A good time to bring it up is when you're already talking about money, as mentioned in the previous step.
You can also start the conversation by discussing a television show, movie, news story, or a divorce that someone you know is going through: ""What a mess. I think you should be able to keep whatever you had before you got married. What do you think?""
If you are attending religious counseling as a couple prior to your marriage, try including a conversation about your finances and how you will support each other during the course of the marriage as a way to broach the subject of a prenuptial agreement: ""My mother left me a sizable inheritance. I'd like to keep that separate from our shared finances so we can use it if one of us gets sick or as a college-fund for our future children. That way, we don't have to worry about saving as much of our regular income. What do you think?""

, Prenuptial agreements center around how to handle certain finances: the income each partner makes before marriage, prior assets, property acquired during the marriage, retirement plans, and how you will support each other.Instead of framing the conversation around the looming possibility of divorce, try sitting down with your partner and planning your financial future as a couple, which includes both past, present, and future assets and income.


This way, you can discuss this subject as something you are doing together for the benefit of both of you (and any children involved), rather than as a contingency plan in case your marriage fails.
Focus on reasons other than a possible break up for the reason you want the agreement: ""So, I have student loans that I will have to pay off over the next ten years. I have some money saved up, and I'd like to keep that aside from our shared finances in case I ever need emergency funds to keep making regular payments. I don't ever want you to be liable for my debt. Does that sounds good to you?""
You can also consider utilizing the services of a mediator who specializes in prenuptial agreements.This will provide a controlled, non-judgmental environment in which you and your partner can sort out the details without the formality of a lawyer present.

, It might not be the most romantic conversation you and your partner ever have, but it's important in a healthy relationship to be able to discuss your fears and concerns.


If you anticipate your partner getting defensive, emphasize your own vulnerability. Conversely, try not to get defensive yourself. Chances are one of you makes more money than the other, but it is almost certain both of you work hard at what you do.You might also explain that it's not the commitment or marriage that you're questioning; it's the legalities of the ""contract"" you're figuratively signing when you get married. In other words, you don't agree with your local marriage/divorce laws, and wish to draft your own version to make the laws suit your particular needs.Encourage your partner to think about his or her own assets and future as well.
Try to keep the tone light. You two are in love, after all.
""I love the fact we're both gainfully employed—big change from the days I was delivering pizzas and living off government macaroni & cheese, right? Now that the universe has decided to give me a win, and I'm making good money now, I think I'd like to set some aside in a separate account to take care of my parents. Would you be alright with that?""

, At this point, both of you should have a good understanding of each other's financial situation and, during these conversations, you should also have gotten an idea of your partner's willingness to commit to a formal legal agreement. If your partner still seems unsure, you will want to try to get them to understand that the legal agreement in no way affects how you feel about them.


Reiterate that it will protect your partner as well: ""I don't want you ever to be responsible for money I owed before I met you. This document will make sure this happens. It also allows you to put some money aside for things that come up in your life.""
Make your reasons clear: ""This isn't because I don't trust you, I just want to make sure our parents/our children/our future is protected.""
Paint the agreement more as a financial plan than as an escape valve: ""We're starting this life together, I'd just like to have a financial roadmap in place so we know exactly where we stand now—and where we need to go—to achieve our mutual dreams. I was never good with my money, but now that we're together I'd like to start.""
If your partner remains reticent, you will have to assess the benefit of pushing them against the cost of alienating them or starting your marriage off on the wrong foot.

, Be sure each person fully and accurately discloses all relevant financial information. Not only should you do this to be honest with each other, but failing to do so could render any prenuptial agreement invalid if challenged in court.You will use this information to draft your prenuptial agreement.


When it doubt, disclose.

, Every state has specific laws surrounding whether prenuptial agreements are allowed and, if so, what types of things cannot be included in them. Generally speaking, you cannot include any of the following in a prenuptial agreement:


Restrictions on child support, custody, or visitation;
Giving up rights to alimony;
Encouragements to divorce; and
Rules about non-financial matters (e.g., who will do chores, whether you will have pets, who will take the child to school)., This will help identify each asset properly in the event you become divorced and the prenuptial agreement is reviewed in a court of law.Include locations and addresses of all your properties; bank account names and numbers; the make, model, and year of any vehicles you own; and explicit descriptions of any valuable belongings in your possession, such as cuts of diamonds on jewelry, or the names of artists for paintings you own.

, Since you are filing a prenuptial agreement, both parties must disclose all their financial assets and debts in the event the agreement is challenged in court., Each person will bring into the marriage their own property and/or assets. In your prenuptial agreement, you should identify the specific property that will remain in the sole possession of its original owner in the event the marriage ends.Also consider what will happen in the event an asset increases in value over the course of a marriage (i.e., if the value of your collectible car appreciates dramatically in value over the course of the next ten years).Be as specific as you can when referring to each asset. There should be no room for confusion regarding the property to which a particular provision of the agreement refers.
Include assets or provisions that deal only with finances and property, such as businesses, vehicles, homes, valuable jewelry, antiques, properties you own, savings accounts, stocks, and inheritances.
Be sure to keep separate property in the original owner's name only throughout the duration of the marriage, or this may override the prenuptial agreement.
For example, ""The following shall constitute the Parties' Separate Property: The property listed on Schedule A as property and on Schedule B as property, which schedules are annexed hereto and made part hereof.""The ""schedules"" would be separate, attached documents that detail specific property for each person.

, After you have decided which property to keep separate, you can also identify in the agreement the property that will be shared between both partners during the marriage.This is called marital property.


You should also detail how assets acquired over the course of the marriage will be divided in the event the marriage ends.For example, ""The following shall constitute the Parties' Marital Property: All property acquired during the marriage until the occurrence of a Termination Event that is not Separate Property as set forth in the previous section ."", Also consider what will happen with any debts that either person brings into the marriage. The agreement can provide that a person is solely responsible for debts he or she brings into the marriage, or it can provide that certain debts will be paid for with marital property.For example, ""Obligations of a party incurred prior to the marriage shall remain the separate obligations of that party. The other party shall not be liable for those obligations, and shall be indemnified and held harmless from them by the responsible party. Such existing obligations shall be paid from the separate property of the responsible party."", You can also use a prenuptial agreement to establish how a partner will survive financially if he or she will be staying at home to take care of any children.It can also outline any financial support, if any, that will be paid by either person to the other in the event of a divorce.


For example, ""In the event of a legal separation, divorce, or annulment, the parties agree to waive any rights to spousal support or maintenance of any kind to which either might otherwise be entitled. The parties agree that this provision may be entered as a complete defense by either party in response to an action for alimony.""This is also a good time to include provisions relating to children from previous marriages, if this situation applies to you. The agreement can detail what support will be given to any minor children in the event of a divorce., This is a particularly contested issue in the event of a divorce.It will be helpful to decide now what will happen to the home you and your partner share if the marriage ends. Think about who will get it or, if it will be sold, how the proceeds from the sale will be divided.


For example, ""In the event of a Termination Event: The marital home shall be placed on the market for sale within one year from the date of the Termination Event and the net proceeds of the sale shall be distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. has the right to remain in the marital residence up to one (1) year following a Termination Event."", You can also include provisions in the prenuptial agreement relating to how large purchases will be made, who will handle shared finances, who will pay household bills, and if you will maintain separate or joint bank accounts., In the prenuptial agreement, you can outline how you and your partner will pay any taxes either of you owe.For example, you can decide whether you will file jointly or separately, or what will be done about pre-existing tax debt for which either person is liable.

, While divorce is by no means an eventuality for you and your partner, one of the major benefits of having a prenuptial agreement is avoiding argument in the case of a divorce. In your agreement, detail how property will be divided in the event of a split, otherwise the law of your state will decide for you.For example, ""In the event of a Termination Event: Each Party shall retain his or her Separate Property, and the other Party agrees not to make any claim in or to such property. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all Martial Property shall be divided between the Parties in accordance with .""Be aware that while you can attempt to include provisions relating to alimony in the agreement, not all states allow this.

, The prenuptial agreement does not have to last forever. You can indicate how long you want it to last using what is known as a ""sunset clause"" to specify a future date on which the agreement is no longer valid. In addition, you may choose to outline any conditions that relate to who ends the marriage or why the marriage ends.You can also detail when and how the prenuptial agreement can be renegotiated at a later date.
For example, ""This Agreement may not be amended or revoked except by an instrument in writing signed by both of the parties and acknowledged and witnessed with the same formalities of this Agreement, expressly modifying or revoking one or more or all of the provisions of this Agreement.""Be aware, however, that states are not likely to give much weight to any sections of a prenuptial agreement that mandate certain consequences for a person based on his or her degree of ""fault"" (like having an affair)., While courts presume prenuptial agreements to be legal, they can be challenged and thrown out if they do not protect both people adequately. After you have drafted the agreement, make sure to keep the following in mind while finalizing it:Make sure each person has fully disclosed all assets and debts.
Make sure neither person has pressured the other to sign, and that each person has had enough time to fully consider the agreement before signing it.
Make sure the agreement considers each person. Don't try to take advantage of the other person or try to leave them with less than they deserve if the marriage ends.
Make sure both people have an opportunity to have their own lawyer read it before they sign., Though the requirements vary by jurisdiction, a prenuptial agreement is a legal document and therefore you must meet certain conditions for the document itself to be legally valid:It should be in writing.
It should be dated and signed by both you and your partner.
Some states require one or two witnesses to the signing of the document.
Both you and your partner should visit a notary public in person, each testify to the document's authenticity, and then get the document officially notarized.
Make sure you have at least three copies for your records—one for each person and another to give to a third-party or save in a shared secure location.

Calculate your budget for the wand.,
Choose the size of the rod.,
Choose your ribbons.,
Choose the type of bells to attach.,
Decide if you want a painted/finished dowel.,
Measure dowel and mark the appropriate length with a pencil.

,
Cut your dowel.,
Sand your cut ends.,
Paint or alter your new wands.,
Cut your ribbon.,
Attach ribbon to wand.,
Add embellishments.,
Shake your wand!

",How to Make a Wedding Ribbon Wand," How much money are you willing to spend on a wand per guest? This will help you to choose your materials wisely.;
, Choosing the length of the rod will affect everything from dowel size to ribbon length.


Hardware stores carry unfinished wood dowels in 36"" or 48"" lengths. (In 2014, one 48"" poplar wood dowel at 1/4"" thickness cost $0.78 at a nationwide hardware store. This equates to six 8"" wands, four 12"" wands, or three 16"" wands.)
The thickness of the rod is also important. Since long and thin equates to delicate (aka, easily breakable) but too thick does nothing for appearance or cost.
Type of wood/material. The type of wood affects strength/durability but also cost.

If you are using a finishing nail (much cheaper than eye hook), you'll want a softer wood dowel so you do not chance splitting the wood.
If you are using a screw eye, you may want a thicker dowel or be sure to have a drill with the appropriate sized drill bit to pre-drill the holes to prevent splitting the wood.


Hold a pencil or roll up a sheet of paper. A normal, unsharpened pencil is a little over 7"" in length. A standard sheet of paper is 8.5 x 11"".
Assess how many dowels will be needed in order to have one for each guest. (You may want to add 10% in case you get more guests or you make a few errors.)

,


Scout craft stores, online, wherever you can get your wedding colors at the best price.
Think of ordering (or making) personalized ribbon for your wands.
If using a finishing nail or hot glue gun, the ribbon length needed will be twice the length of the dowel. (Though you can alter that as you see fit.)
If using a screw eye, you will need approximately 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) longer than the wand length).
Doing either 3 colors, or 3 types of ribbon seems to be the general rule/appeal. You, however, can do whatever you choose. Some people opt for different thicknesses, textures, let your creativity go wild... within your budget.

,


Jingle bells or traditional shaped bells? Jingle bells are cheaper but traditional more attractive.
The size of your ribbon will also determine the size of the bells you can use, unless you have an eye screw and will attach the bell onto there. (See step 12.)
What about color? Gold, silver, glittered, frosted, colored... more choices to make.

, If so, buy paint supplies. Spray paint is much faster and leaves a smoother finish but if you have paint already then you may choose another route.

,, Wear appropriate safety gear no matter how you choose to cut your dowels.


If doing it by hand, it is easier if you use a miter box to ensure a straight, even cut.

, Use fine grade sandpaper (~ 80 grit) to sand from the outside, in toward the center to ensure a smooth, splinter free end.

,


If you want to save money, and appreciate the unfinished look, leave it as is.
Some people like to age the wands more so you can soak it in tea/coffee for discoloration or use another method to distress it.
Use one wand as a test wand to test the different finishes and get creative.
Once your wands are completely painted, move on to the next step.

, Where you cut depends on the look you want.


Lots of ribbon streamers or a few? Staggered or even streamer lengths? Ribbon to the end of the wand or stopping at the middle?
For finished nails, you want to hammer in the middle of unadorned ribbon (i.e. no bells), so you would measure accordingly (add approximately an extra inch to one side of ribbons receiving a bell.
For a hot glue gun, you will lose a little material in your main tie and a little more for each bell tied on, so plan accordingly.
For a screw eye, you will use the end of the ribbon to loop through and tie off.
If it's too much thinking for now, you can always guesstimate, using longer ribbon amounts and cut off what you don't want.

, Use your selected method to tie ribbon onto wand.

,


If attaching a bell to the screw eye, then you may need a jump ring or similar clip unless you can unbend eye to place bell directly in ring before you close it again.
Attach bells (and/or other decorations) to ribbon.

After each bell is attached, tie the ribbon off
Once you are satisfied, you can add glue to secure the knot and tie it tighter.
You may also want to add other embellishments.

Buy or make a neat hold-all to keep everything inside.,
Find suitable items to place inside.,
Buy other items to stash in the survival kit.,
Add some food items.,
Put in something personal.",How to Make a Bride Survival Kit," Ideally it should be compact and easily carried, so that the bride finds it easy to toss in with anything else she's toting around on the wedding day. A small purse, tiny keepsake box or a toiletry bag are probably good choices.


For an extra-special touch, buy or make a bag or container in the wedding colours (if you already know them). For a special touch, embroider or write the bride's name or ""Bride Survival Kit"" on the item.
Make sure that it's big enough to hold all the items you put in it, but not so big that it's awkward to carry around.;
, Before going out and buying a bunch of items to put inside, consider using some items you probably already have in your house. You can always improve their appearance by by tying ribbons (in the wedding colours) around them. Look for items such as:


Tampons/sanitary napkins/panty liners (it's always best to add one of each, assume nothing)
Q-tips
Band-aids
Safety pins
Spare pair of pantyhose.

, When thinking of what to put inside, try to think of everything that could go wrong at a wedding (unless you are the bride - don't stress yourself out!). Then, put in an item that could fix or help with that problem. For example:


Mini nail file
Small tube of lip gloss
Topcoat of nail polish
Travel-sized hand sanitizer
Mini hairspray
Travel-sized sunblock
Compact mirror
Mini body lotion
Small pack of mints
Comb
Mini sewing kit
Travel-sized deodorant
Stain remover stick or sheets
Small pack of tissues
Sample-sized mascara (preferably waterproof).

, It's a great idea to give the bride something small to nibble on if she's feeling nervous or a little peckish before the ceremony. Don't put in anything too big or messy. Consider something like a granola bar and a small juice box (choose something light-coloured such as apple juice - not something that will stain the dress!). To be on the safe side, you could put in a mini water bottle instead of a juice box.

, Don't write her a novel or make her a scrapbook - just add a handwritten note of encouragement and well-wishes to help her keep a handle on her nerves. If she likes sentimental things, write her a nice note about how much she means to you and that you wish her all the best. If she prefers something with a bit of humor, write her a few jokes (perhaps wedding-themed jokes) to make her laugh away the nerves.

Be prepared for your decision being seen by some as going against tradition.,
Learn the reasons why women choose to not change their names.,
Consider your options.,
Discuss your plan with your husband-to-be.,
Inform his parents, and yours.,
Ask your officiant not to introduce you as ""Mr. and Mrs. John Smith"" during the ceremony.,
Make certain that your names appear correctly on the marriage certificate and any other paper with legal ramifications (such as the deed to a home you buy jointly).,
Put it in print.",How to Tell People You're Keeping Your Maiden Name," However, traditions are not set in stone. In some countries like Italy or Spain, it is traditional for women to keep their family name, and even when a woman decides to use her husband's surname she can't relinquish her own and will continue to use it in official documents, ID cards, passports etc. for the rest of her life.;
, You are certainly not alone in your decision. Women choose to keep their birth names for a variety of reasons:


Women with established careers and women who marry when they're older are less likely to change their names because they've already established a reputation with their birth name and may feel that changing it would challenge the recognition they've already accomplished. (E.g. - When providing references for work done in the past, a woman who has changed her name would have to ask a potential employer to use her birth name when calling her references, as her old employers or professors will not recognize her by her new last name. This creates an inconvenience that for some women outweighs the benefits of changing their name.)






One's name is part of one's identity, and many women choose to keep their identities independent from their marital status. Your name is your own, part of your identity and heritage, and you have every right to keep it if you wish.







,


You can take your husband's name legally but keep your birth name for use professionally and socially (not including family events). Whether or not you change your name legally, you can still go by your married name among family. Unless they're checking ID at the family BBQ, they will probably never know the difference. But just in case, let your family know that you are maintaining your birth name at work for privacy purposes and if they ever hear you addressed with your birth name with regards to you they should just play along.






You can also take your husband's name as a middle name, or keep your birth name as a middle name.






Swaminathan Aiyer, a famous Indian writer, adopted his wife's maiden name as his middle name to maintain a sense of gender equality even when she adopted his last name. If the issue is over equality, this is a viable option.






When both couples add each other's surname, in hyphenation, any children will be better identified as belonging to each parent, instead of only to the father.







, Any disagreement about this decision should be resolved before you walk down the aisle. Also, discuss the possibility of children at this stage, as you and your new husband or husband-to-be will also need to decide what surname you will give to your children (people will probably ask).

, You may find that they are supportive of your decision. If they are more traditional, you may encounter some resistance. Just keep in mind that you need not justify your decision to anyone. Hopefully, they will soon respect your plans to keep your full identity.

, Instead, ask that both your names be announced. You may even want to ask your officiant (or even your DJ) to announce to everybody that both you and your husband will continue to be known by your own names. This is an excellent way to spread the word quickly so that people will know how to address you.

, As far as the official paperwork goes, it always takes less effort to keep a name than to change one. Make sure that any errors get corrected before you sign any document.

, For wedding thank-you notes, print or have printed return address labels or envelopes which list the names of both you and your husband. Sign the cards with both names. Many people will take this as an opportunity to update their address books. Seeing your name unchanged in print will help them to know how to address you.

Pick a child that is three to seven years old.,
Choose a child who is confident and capable.,
Ask the child’s parents first.,
Propose with a ring pop.,
Tell the child you want them to be a “Ring Protection Agent.” Rather than asking them to be the “ring bearer,” which may not make sense to them, ask them to be in charge of protecting the rings.,
Take them out for a special day.,
Make them a “Be our ring bearer” puzzle.",How to Ask Someone to Be Your Ring Bearer," A general rule for the ring bearer is a child between three and seven years old. This is a wide range of development, so take it as a guide. This ensures that the child can walk and that they’ll be able to perform the duties you need them to.If you go with a child under three, you’ll increase the chances of them crying, being distracted, falling, or generally not quite being able to get from point A to point B.
It’s okay to choose a child older than seven, but older kids may be less interested and you may lose the “cute little kid” charm if you go older.;
, Shy kids don’t usually want to be in front of a whole crowd of wedding attendees, so they may get scared as ring bearer. Stick with a kid who likes to be seen. It’s also important that they understand what they are supposed to do and are capable of getting up to the stage without wandering off or getting distracted., Before you talk to the child about being in your wedding, it’s important to bring it up to their parent or parents first. You want the parents to be on board before you get the child excited about it.It’s also good to talk to the parents about who will pay for the ring bearer’s outfit.
When you ask the parents, say, ""We would love to have Skyler be our ring bearer. Would you be willing to pay for his outfit? He's important to us, and having him in the wedding is important. Maybe we can work out a way to share the cost?""

, Buy a ring shaped candy pop and unwrap it. Put it in a box. Write “Will you be our ring bearer?” on the inside of the box. Wrap it up like a gift and give it to the child. Kids typically like candy, so they will be excited about that and will associate helping you with the fun of candy.Make sure the parents don’t mind if their child has candy. The parents may also have to read what the box says, if the kid is young and can’t read yet.

, Give them a special shirt that says “Ring Protection Agent,” or give them a badge with their title on it.Make this as elaborate as you want to make it fun for the child. Let them wear cool sunglasses. Give them a walkie talkie. Put the rings in a “secure” box instead of on a pillow.
This works well if you have two kids you want to have as ring bearers. They can work together in a team to keep the rings safe.

, If you want to ask them in a big way that’s an adventure, plan to spend a whole day (or afternoon/night) with them. Talk to the parents and setup a time you can take the child off their hands. Take them to play at the park or go to a movie. Buy them a toy or a fancy dinner. After you’ve had some fun, pop the big question.


If you spend this kind of day with them often anyway, they won’t know something special is coming. If this is a first, they’ll remember how you asked them in a fun way.
Make sure you take them to do something that is fun for them rather than for you.
Say, ""Since you are our favorite little kiddo, we want you to help us out with our wedding. Could we go do something fun together so we can tell you all about it?""
Say, ""We still need one person to help with our wedding and it HAS to be a little man, like you. If we took you out for some ice cream, would you be willing to help us out on our wedding day?""

, Take a piece of cardboard or paper and write “Will you be our ring bearer?” on it. Cut it out into fun shapes to create a puzzle. Give the puzzle to the child and tell them the puzzle has a special message for them on it.If they need help with the puzzle, start putting a few pieces into position for them.
You or the parents may have to read the message to them once they put the puzzle together.
Decorate the puzzle as elaborately as you want to make it extra fun.

Give her your undivided attention.,
Do a chore that she would normally do.,
Help her with a project.,
Give your mom a day off.,
Share your favorite family stories.,
Ask her about her favorite birthday memories.",How to Treat Your Mother on Her Birthday1," One of the best ways to communicate that you care is to spend some uninterrupted quality time with your mother. If you’re celebrating your mom’s birthday, don’t spend half your time together checking your phone or chatting with a friend.Turn your phone and other distracting devices off in honor of her big day.
When you’re together, focus on having conversations and engaging with her. Even if you’re in a group, your mom should be your top priority.;
, You’d be surprised how much your mother would appreciate a break from a routine task, like cleaning the house or washing the car. Show you care by taking on the work for her.She’ll appreciate it even more if you choose a chore that she finds especially onerous, like doing the laundry, cleaning the bathroom, or raking the yard.

, Giving your mom your time and effort is a wonderful way to show you care while helping her accomplish something that she has been meaning to do. Pick a project that has been on her plate for a while, and lend her a hand to get it done once and for all.For instance, if she has been meaning to plant a garden, help her pick out some seeds, put on some gloves, and pick up a spade!
If she would like to redecorate a room, help her shop for supplies, move furniture, paint walls, and hang up new art.
Be sure to let your mom supervise the project, so it's completed according to her vision. You want to support her efforts, not take them over. Consult with her about how you can be the most helpful.

, Sometimes, the best gift you can give your mother is some free-time to enjoy herself however she wants. To do that, make arrangements in advance to cover any obligations that she might have on her birthday.For instance, if she has other children, arrange a babysitter or babysit yourself. If she has a dog, volunteer to take care of it for the day or while she spends the night elsewhere.
Oftentimes, just letting your mother sleep in is a much appreciated gesture. If that’s the case, give her the gift of not bothering her in the morning, and bring her breakfast in bed when she wakes up.

, Your mother will feel appreciated if you can recall memories and anecdotes that you both cherish. Be sure to pick out a couple examples of times when she saved the day or did something wonderful to express your gratitude and show that you’re paying attention.It's as easy as saying, ""Mom, remember that time when you surprised me with a party at the skate park for my birthday? That was awesome.""
Bring up things like your family camping trip to Yellowstone, the time your mom came to your rescue when you were stuck at an airport six hours away, or the holiday traditions that you learned from your mom that make each celebration so special.
You can even make this concept into an unforgettable gift idea by creating a memory jar. Pick a pretty container, and fill it with slips of paper that you’ve written your favorite memories of your times together on.

, Listening to your mother’s life stories shows that you’re interested in her as a person. You’ll also be grateful you took the time to learn something about what her life was like before you were around.You can spark a conversation about her past by saying, “Hey mom, what’s the first birthday that you remember?” or “What’s the coolest thing that you’ve ever done to celebrate your birthday?”
You could even sit down together and look through an old photo album or two to jog her memory. If you see an image that intrigues you, ask her questions about it, such as: “Where was this taken?” or “Who is that sitting next to you?” or “How old were you then?”

Include all your family favorites in it, from staple main dishes to memorable treats to traditional holiday baking.Besides giving ingredients lists and directions, you can personalize the book more by adding photos and personal stories alongside the recipes. For instance, you can include photos of your family enjoying each dish and/or text that explains the origin of a particular recipe.
Consider making copies for the whole family so that your mom will see that her culinary traditions will continue to be passed along.

, Demonstrate that you’re paying attention to what she loves by giving her a gift that fits perfectly into one of her personal collections.

Remember to have fun.",How to Enjoy Your Wedding as a Pregnant Bride," Pregnancy comes with various physical changes from nausea to fatigue and feeling like a balloon. Think about scheduling your wedding during your second trimester when morning sickness is usually gone and your baby hasn’t grown to a size that makes you feel large.Think about factors like fatigue and any medical issues you may be experiencing as a part of your pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes. This can help guide elements such as the time of day for the ceremony and reception, your food choices, and even how big of a wedding you want.For example, if you tire easily, schedule the event for the afternoon and early evening, which may also help save money that you can put towards your honeymoon or baby.;
, Fatigue may be one of the biggest factors for you during the wedding, but you may also not entirely feel like yourself when you’re pregnant. Keeping your wedding personalized to your and your future husband’s wishes can help you enjoy the day to the fullest.


Concentrate on scheduling elements of the occasion that you are sure to enjoy. Remember that even because you’re pregnant, it’s still your day and you deserve to have the very best time possible.Stick to your wishes even if someone tries to sway you towards something else because you’re pregnant. You can say something like “I really appreciate your consideration on the reception and food, but I’ve had a chance to think about it and would like to do it this way.”

, If you're planning on a church wedding or just a simple ceremony in another venue, you’ll need someone to officiate and validate your wedding. Consider a variety of venues, since some churches won't permit weddings of a pregnant bride.Ask church officials and potential officiants if that are able to marry a pregnant bride as well as if they feel comfortable doing so. Respect their decision and move on if necessary. Remember to not feel ashamed—it’s completely common in this day and age for brides to be pregnant.
Identify different types of venues you could hold your ceremony. Consider churches, hotels, and restaurants. Ask friends, family, and colleagues if they have suggestions of potential venues for the ceremony.
Be aware that some churches require pre-marital counseling. Ask about the requirements.Some chaplains/priests/other faith officiants may expect you to ""tone down"" the wedding to make it a more private affair. If that doesn't suit you, then consider a compromise such as a private wedding and a large reception or find another officiant.
Talk to the officiant about the length of the ceremony and vows. Remember that you may be tired or have low blood sugar that may require having a tall stool or something to lean on if you get tired.

, Planning your reception should be a relatively easy task for your wedding. However, there certain factors you may want to keep in mind when touring potential venues such as that you may need to sit or use the restroom more often.


Ask questions to the venue staff about access to restrooms and elements such as having extra seating so you can sit down if need be.Find out if the venue can accommodate your dietary needs. This includes making sure that there is food available to you throughout the event as well as if they can offer pregnancy safe foods.You should also ask if they can make either bottled or filtered water available to you during the event.Consider how your decorations will fit in the venue or even ask the staff if they can provide decorations. You may find that you are sensitive to the smells of flowers during your pregnancy and want to avoid floral arrangements.

, You may encounter a few challenges with the dress as your baby grows, but that doesn’t mean you have to settle for anything that looks like frump with a bump. Get a style you love and find a way to have it tailored to accommodate your bump.


Consider hiring a dressmaker to recreate a style you like that can be let out if you need. You can also think about a maternity specific bridal gown. These are usually designed with a growing belly in mind. Let either the dressmaker or bridal salon know in advance that you are pregnant, which may help them better prepare for your visit.Choose a style that is comfortable and accounts for the fact that you will likely need to use the restroom more frequently.
Avoid corsets, tightly laced bodices, mermaid/ trumpet cut, or sheath dresses. These may not only be hard to let out as you grow, but may also constrict you if you swell during your big day. In addition, they could also make it difficult to go to the bathroom.If your still in the early stages of your pregnancy, these shapes may still be comfortable and can highlight a small bump if you want to show off your new feature.Consider styles such as A-line, empire or a dress with a tulle overlay for comfort.It’s easier to alter these styles and they may also make it easier to get to the bathroom or accommodate for swelling on your big day. These more flowy styles can also conceal a small bump if you choose to hide your pregnancy.
Choose any color dress you like and that makes you feel comfortable. Don't be hampered by social conventions on white dresses and virginity.Plan more fittings for your dress to accommodate your growing bump. You may want to schedule fittings for every couple of weeks depending on how far along your pregnancy is., Pregnancy often involves swelling, especially in the hands and feet. Get yourself comfortable shoes and put on other accessories that will not constrict you.


Consider getting several pairs of shoes so that you can wear what is most comfortable on your big day. You may want anything from comfortable flats, to kitten heels, or even flip-flops. Remember that your shoes should allow you to stand, dance, and walk around without feeling even more achy and tired.Don’t be surprised if your wedding shoes are a bigger size than your pre-pregnancy shoes.Get jewelry that you can easily remove. For example, you may want to wear a large cocktail ring that you can easily switch between different fingers if your hands swell. Wear bracelets and necklaces that have clasps so that you can more easily put them on and take them off.
Remember that most accessories, such as a veil and bouquet, remain unaffected by your belly size, so enjoy all of them as much as wished.

, Pregnancy tends to make most women swell, especially in the hands and feet. As a result, your wedding ring may not fit on the big day. You may want to choose a “mock” ring to use on your wedding day and then get the real ring once you’ve given birth.


Realize that you can also purchase your wedding band and then get it fitted to your fingers after the birth. Ask your jeweler what your options for sizing are if you are pregnant.
Keep your real ring part of the ceremony by wearing it around your neck or placing it on the ring cushion next to the mock ring. You could even wear your wedding ring on your pinky finger until your ring finger shrinks down to size.

, Weddings can be very stressful and cause you more fatigue if you are pregnant. In the weeks before your wedding, make sure to get enough sleep and other rest so that you can fully enjoy your big day.


Recognize that pregnancy can change your sleeping patterns.If this is a problem, talk to your doctor before your wedding for tips to help you de-stress and get enough sleep so you can enjoy your wedding. Take naps if you need to get you through the day.Go to bed early the night before your wedding so that you can enjoy your day with minimal fatigue. Take a nap before your ceremony if you can.
Consider getting a pregnancy massage either the day before or morning of your wedding to help you rest and relax.

, Most brides are given this advice, but it’s especially important when you’re pregnant. You’ll likely be more fatigued and may even have to deal with feeling sick. Give yourself some extra time throughout the day, which may make you less tired and more able to enjoy it.Make sure there is time between appointments such as hair and makeup or any other events for you to sit down and have a moment alone.Consider building in some extra time for a nap between the ceremony and reception. You can offer guests games or cocktails during this time.

, Weddings are stressful events and generally require coordination with several different people. Whether you are having a wedding with a planner or family and friends are there, don’t be shy about reaching out for help or delegating tasks to people.Avoid being a bridezilla, even if your hormones are raging. For example, you could say “Mom, I feel very overwhelmed talking to the officiant. Will you go with me or talk to him yourself. You know what my wishes are.”
Keep your fiancé in the loop and ask him to help, too. Your partner can often be a calming force who helps you relax and refocus on the importance of the day—the two of you.

, Recognize that you will in all likelihood get tired during your wedding. Allow yourself to sit down or catch your breath whenever you feel necessary. Don’t feel ashamed—your guests will probably understand and may even help you find a seat or dote on you.Make sure there is always a chair in your general area so that you can sit down if you get tired or woozy. Grab a chair if you’re talking and get tired. You can say “I’m so sorry, do you mind if we sit and chat, my feet are killing me and the baby is kicking me so hard.”
Step away for a few minutes if you need a break. You may be emotional and need to gather yourself. Let your fiancé know and ask someone to come along with you if necessary.

, You’ll need to eat to keep up your energy throughout the day. Having a healthy breakfast and lunch as well as snacks on your big day can not only keep you feeling well, but may give you’re the same type of culinary enjoyment your guests are experiencing.Start the day with a healthy breakfast such as toast with peanut butter and some fruit. Have snacks that contain protein and complex carbohydrates like whole-grain crackers and cheese.Make sure that you eat lunch or dinner at your reception and feel free to “snack” along the way. Many people can get caught up in the celebration and visiting with people and forget to eat. Have your fiancé or a friend or family member remind you to sit down and enjoy some food.
Keep yourself hydrated with water throughout the day.Use your own discretion on enjoying a sip of champagne, but you should avoid alcohol at the reception for the health and safety of your baby.Consider sparkling cider or grape juice if you want to skip the champagne.

, One of the parts of your big day that you can look forward to is the send off to your honeymoon, or babymoon as many people call it now. Take a honeymoon that's realistic to your pregnancy and promotes relaxation and couple time.


Select a location that isn't difficult to access as well as doesn't require a lot of planning. Aim for a place that promises peace, quiet, and pampering.
Check with the location and any places you might stay to ensure they have hospital facilities or infrastructure to transport you in case you have an emergency.
Be sure that your insurance covers any pregnancy complications or even giving birth in other locations.
Consider postponing the honeymoon until after the baby's born. You can go as a family or take a couple of days away from your new baby if you like.

, Understand the feelings of others around you and that they may have cultural or religious that make it hard for them to accept you as a pregnant bride.Try and have compassion with them and let them feel your joy. Reacting positively may help you ignore stigmas and truly enjoy your day.Remember to not feel ashamed at all costs. You’ve done nothing wrong and have the right to fully enjoy your day without judgment., In most societies, it was relatively uncommon for women to get pregnant before marriage until recently. Among older generations, such as your parents or grandparents, stigmas about having sex and getting pregnant before marriage may linger.Although their comments may hurt you, try to realize and acknowledge their positions.


Consider making a list of guests who may have a difficult time with your pregnancy at the wedding. Think about ways in which you can engage them without offending their sensibilities. For example, you could not mention the baby in their presence.
Acknowledge their position with respect. For example, you could say “Gramma, I understand that things were different in your time and respect your position, but attitudes towards being pregnant at your wedding have changed among my generation.” Likewise, you can say “Mrs. Smith, I know this isn’t common in your religion, but I want you to know how happy I am that you are here to celebrate with us.”, Just as acknowledging stigmas is important, it’s also a good idea to express your happiness to anyone who passes judgment. You might find that this relaxes the person—and you-- and helps them embrace your “condition.”Tell the person how excited you are to be a wife and mother. Mention that you feel very blessed to be able to have a baby.Let people who are judgmental of you know that today's attitudes are far more relaxed and compassionate. You can also say that it is acceptable within your social circle to be pregnant at your wedding., You may want to find ways to acknowledge the obvious in your big day. From highlighting your bump to making a combined vow to your baby, you can have your baby a part of the ceremony to show that you are comfortable and happy with the situation.


Find ways to include your baby that make you comfortable. For example, you could keep it simple by tying a pink or blue ribbon around your waist.
Incorporate the baby more fully by giving a vow with your husband to the baby or singing a song about a little family or happiness. For example, you could say together “I take you, Jack, and our little bundle of joy in good and bad times.” Then have your husband-to-be make a similar statement. Think of songs about families or happy moments to acknowledge the pregnancy. For example, you might choose “This Little Light” or “We are Family.”

, In some cases, you may find that it makes you most comfortable to hide your belly as much as possible. This can not only help you deal with the stigmas of other people, but also may help you relax and enjoy the day more.


Choose a dress that camouflages your belly.
Avoid mentioning that you are pregnant or pointing towards your belly.

, Try and focus on enjoying each moment of your wedding day. Not only can this help you relax and have fun, but may be a great memory you can share with your child as they get older.Allow yourself to dance, chat, sit, eat and do other things any bride would do on her big day.
Let any negative comments roll off of you. Seek out people who will lift you up and remind you of the joyous occasions.

If relevant, are your spouse/partner and children happy with this decision too? Think through the reasons as to why you don't want to stay with family first and if need be, discuss this with people traveling with you to advise them of your decision and get feedback.;
, It won't help things if you phone or email ahead to say you're not staying with family, only to find the whole town is booked out. Be sure that there is something you can use and afford.


It may be helpful to choose a place that is fairly close to where your family is. That way, you can spend a reasonable amount of time with them and then head off for bed and not have too far to travel. On the other hand, if the place is farther away, this might be the excuse you're looking for to spend even less time together.

, Do not email or text that you're not staying with your family this time. This requires a phone call or a Skype call, so that you can convey your message with kindness.

, This will give them the time needed to digest the change of usual plans, and it'll also ensure they're not out buying new sheets for the bed they thought you'd be sleeping in.

, You may be breaking out in a sweat at the thought of your dysfunctional family's usual antics, but have courage that by making the decision to stay out of it and set boundaries on the time you'll be visiting, you've just bought yourself a healthy distance. Bear that in mind when your anxiety levels top out.

, Be compassionate when explaining your choice to stay elsewhere; remember that they're probably so stuck in the habitual way that things play out whenever you visit that this is likely to come as both a shock and possibly feel like somewhat of an insult. Some ways that you might approach this include:


""Hi Mom. I've got something to tell you––I know we usually stay with you when we come to town but this year Jay and I've decided to rent a serviced apartment for the week. What with little Jason turning 5 and running around so much and Jenny being 3 and a total terror, as well as my pregnancy, I just thought it'd be kinder to you and dad not to have all of us bearing down on you the whole time. We've booked a place really close to yours, so we'll be able to pop back and forth all the time, and it also has this neat restaurant downstairs, which I thought we could all go to one time during the week, as a break from all the cooking. As it's serviced, we get someone else cleaning up after the kids' messes and that gives you and I lots of quality, non-cleaning time to spend together. I realize this is a big change from before but we've grown so much as a family that we just feel it's the right thing to do this time.""
""Hey Reg and Maude, thanks for asking us down this year. We've decided to do things a little differently this time by booking a motel room not far from you guys. We thought it'd be much easier to use this as a base for our holiday, as we're going to visit lots of sites and go out at night a lot and we didn't want to disturb you. We're close enough to come and see you plenty while we're in town and we thought it'd be nice if we all went out together one night to see the play at the local theater near where we're staying, if you'd like to. Please let us know what times of day are most convenient for us to call by and spend time with you.""

, The moment you say something like ""Sorry"" or ""I hope this is okay with you/doesn't upset you"", you're admitting that you are doing something that your family members have a ""right"" to disagree to. They don't have this right and you don't need to feel sorry for them, or to apologize for your mature choice. Realize the things that you aren't burdening your family with by not staying, such as:


Less cleaning work for them
Less cooking work for them
More genuinely happy connecting time when you're not spending way too much time in each other's presence, and less chance to repeat the old cycles of nitpicking, sniping, criticizing or whatever else comes up when you're in each others' laps all the time.

, To remove the standard stay from your visit, family members may feel slighted, cheated of an opportunity to spend time with you or even worried that you might return the favor at your end by forcing them to find paid accommodation rather than staying with you. Be prepared to reassure them to the extent needed but don't make compromises that won't ultimately work for you. In particular, stress how much quality time you'll definitely spend together by highlighting special events that you do intend to share with them, such as dinners or get-togethers. Mean what you say here, so don't overdo the promises unless you intend on keeping them.


For example, if your intent really is to stop having these family members stay at your place on top of you not staying with them, don't go reassuring them that nothing has changed when they come and visit you. However, if that's not the case, by all means reassure them that they're still welcome to stay at your ""super, large house"" when they come to visit (and by implication, inferring that their house is too small for such visits).

, If the reason for no longer staying with your family is surrounded by lots of in-fighting, criticism and put downs, be prepared to sidestep the emotional baggage that may come your way. Instead of responding in anger, righteously or sulkily, aim to stay upbeat and polite. You may need to fake it, especially if the family member really knows how to push your buttons but by staying polite and refusing to argue, cry or make excuses beyond your initial explanation, you don't leave them with a lot of ground to keep arguing.


Breathe deeply to keep yourself calm. If you feel a resentful, angry or unhelpful comment bubbling up while explaining the change in plans, count to 10, breathe deeply and answer courteously instead.

, It may take some getting used to the first time but once it becomes clear to everyone involved that this is actually working very well, then it will break the ice and allow a new habit to form. Do your very best to keep visits to the length that you know you can handle and stay upbeat and polite during. That way, the whole visit will remain pleasant and tolerable for everyone.

For someone with disordered eating, this can be particularly stressful and anxiety-provoking. Make sure to find a private and safe space to talk with someone about their eating and behaviors, rather than in large, public holiday gatherings.Choose a safe place that is away from distractions. Consider asking them to talk in another room or outside. For example, consider saying, ""I was hoping to talk with you privately for a minute. Is that okay?""
Consider setting a time to talk with them by phone when they aren't busy. Consider saying, ""I know the holidays can be overwhelming, but I was hoping to chat with you sometime soon. Is there a good time to call you?""

, While it is hard to tell if someone has disordered eating habits after interacting with them only a few times, be willing to express your concerns in a thoughtful way. Rather than focusing specifically on their eating habits, try to understand how they are doing physically and emotionally. Disordered eating is more than just about food.Share specific thoughts about when and how you felt concerned about their eating habits or exercise behaviors. Talk with them about any previous experiences or people you know who have had disordered eating.

By being proactive, you may be able to helpful prevent or reduce triggers for them.
Listen attentively to their thoughts about food and themselves. Someone with disordered eating may have obsessive or constantly negative thoughts about their appearance and food.

Temptations can be high so many people want to talk about how they are controlling their cravings. Help to reduce the chatter about dieting at holiday gatherings.Someone with disordered eating may feel triggered by talk of dieting to restrict themselves further or becoming more obsessive about their looks.
Avoid talking about your dieting success stories, as this may make others feel worse inadvertently.

, Many people will give themselves excuses for their eating behaviors based on moral judgments. They feel like it's okay to reward themselves with a piece of cake if they went to the gym for two hours earlier. Or, they may say they're ""being good"" by eating a salad rather than having pizza.When talking with someone who has an eating disorder, these moral judgments are particularly acute. Restrictive eating becomes ""good"" while giving in to eating something high in calories is ""bad.""
By talking about food in a non-judgmental way, you can help to normalize food. Eating should not be a painful and sinful experience.

, Avoid picking apart what others are eating. This can feel like judgment. Help to make different foods, both nutritious and those less-so, seem normal. While overindulging or restricting may seem worrisome, talking about it in a large group while at a holiday gathering is likely to do little good.Help to make the person with disordered eating feel empowered rather than judged.
While it's important to make sure they are safe, avoid being overly critical every time you see what food choices they are making.

, Avoid stereotyping disordered eating based on someone's looks alone. People who struggle with disordered eating come in all shapes and sizes. But paying more attention to their ongoing behaviors and actions, rather than their appearance, you can understand better someone's struggle.


Be mindful of your own preconceptions about who may have an eating disorder. While some thoughts may stem from truth, others may be simply based on snap judgments.
Critically think about someone's actions more than their appearance. Listen to what they say. And focus on their actions over time.

, While it may seem counterintuitive, focusing on someone's looks even if you think they look healthy and attractive, could spur them to think otherwise. Someone with an eating disorder as a distorted sense of their appearance and looks, and may see a compliment as a judgment.Instead of saying things like, ""You look so good"" or ""You're looking very fit,"" try focusing on making compliments about their work, their personality, or their life in general.
By focusing comments away from the body, someone may be less triggered to think or act negatively about themselves.

, The simple act of making someone feel special and appreciated can do a world of good for their self-esteem and confidence. Around the holidays, there may be heightened stress and temptations. Remind those you're concerned about that you care and appreciate them being there.Use simple words of gratitude such as, ""I am so thankful to have you join us here today.""
Make them feel welcome rather than isolated. Provide hugs, smiles, and warm greetings.
Tell them that you appreciate them, and are glad they are present with you.

Plan ahead to avoid feeling stressed.,
Keep a non-alcoholic beverage always in hand.,
Avoid parties where temptations are high.,
Consider hosting your own party.",How to Stay Sober During the Holidays2," Think about the upcoming parties and the people you'll likely see at these events. Pay attention to people or activities that you think could trigger stress or make you feel tempted to drink. By planning ahead, you won't be caught off-guard.For example, if there are certain family members that you dread seeing at a holiday event, think about ways to avoid talking with them, or avoid seeing them altogether. Consider coming early or arriving late to an event to minimize time with certain people that trigger your stress.
Don't feel obligated to attend every party that you're invited to. Consider picking events where booze will be less prevalent.

, Friends and strangers at parties may offer you a drink. While they may think that they're being helpful, it can possibly lead to temptation. Keep a beverage in hand to avoid these gestures.Feel free to tell, or not tell, others that you're staying sober when you're at a party.
Keep your glass full and in arm's reach. When you see others passing around alcoholic drinks, you'll have your own beverage to keep you focused.

, Some parties may be more focused on drinking than others. Think about who’s hosting the party, if it’s a late-night event, and where it’s located. Office parties may be less alcohol-focused than a party with your old college buddies. Don’t attend parties that just make you feel tempted at every turn.If you’re not sure what the party will be like, think about how to handle yourself while you’re there. Consider leaving when the alcohol is poured or when people keep handing you drinks.
Know that it’s okay to say ‘no.’ Avoid feeling like you should give into other people’s wishes. It’s important to focus on your health and sobriety first.

, Invite friends and family to your home where you’re better able to control the environment. Remind them that you’re staying sober, so it’s best to leave the alcohol back at home.Have a party with games, music, or other interactive activities. Make it less about food and drink only.

Have supportive friends to call when you're feeling tempted.,
Avoid hanging out with old drinking buddies.,
Attend local Alcoholics Anonymous meetings during the holidays.",How to Stay Sober During the Holidays3," While it may be difficult to talk about your sobriety, it will be less awkward than if you’re having to explain yourself in the middle of a tempting situation. Being open can help others to understand your perspective so that they can respect your decisions.Talk first with the people who you trust the most. They will likely be supportive and helpful as you navigate staying sober over the holidays.
If you’re feeling anxious about talking with them in person, consider calling or emailing them. Avoid texting about the subject if it’s the first time you’re talking with them about your sobriety.

, There may be certain people in your life who help you when things are tough. During the holidays, you may be feeling particularly lonely, angry, or sad. Call your trusted friends first, instead of turning to drinking.Focus on having two or three friends or family members that can be your “calling buddies” when you’re feeling like drinking. Talk with them in advance about this, and ask them if it’s okay to call from time to time for reassurance.
If you feel less comfortable with calling friends or family, consider calling your sponsor through a group like Alcoholics Anonymous, or a similar sobriety group.
If you are seeing a counselor or are currently in alcohol or drug treatment, talk with your provider about possible numbers to call when feeling tempted.

, While it may feel tempting to go back to your old hang-out spots, you’ll likely end up running to your old drinking buddies. The holidays can push people towards old, bad habits because it’s easier than dealing with the stressors of family and social expectations.Try making new friends and developing new interests instead of hanging out with old friends.
Make early new year’s resolutions that focus on the “new” you so that you’re less inclined to fall back on your old ways.

, Whether you’re currently attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or not, this program could be particularly helpful around the holidays when you’re feeling more stressed.

Consult your fiancé before committing to plans.,
Be honest with insistent family members.,
Consider alternating holidays or years.,
Be flexible.,
Consider hosting one of the holidays.",How to Survive the Holidays As a Newly Engaged Couple1," Scheduling your lives as a couple is probably something you’ve already learned to do, but holiday family obligations can potentially lead to scheduling conflicts. Further, each of your families will be excited to see you and your fiancé to celebrate the big news. The good news is that with some planning, you will likely be able to see everyone!For example, talk to your partner and ensure that caroling with your Aunt Edna on Christmas Eve sounds good to them too.
Respond to invitations with something like, “That sounds great, but I have to talk to Samantha to make sure we’re on the same page before committing to any holiday plans.”;
, Most of your family members should understand that you have additional social obligations this year. However, if Uncle Javier is upset that you don’t immediately agree to go ice fishing with him New Year’s Day, explain why you need to talk it over with your fiancé.Say something like, “I’m a part of two families now, and I want to make sure I get to see as many people as possible, on our side of the family as well as Jessie’s. I'll talk to Jessie and let you know when we have a plan.""
If your parents get cantankerous, remember that seeing you less is a loss for them, and try to be understanding without letting your parents control you. You could try asking them how they split the holidays between each other’s families when they first got married. This can backfire into an argument, so stay even-tempered.

, Sometimes the simplest way to decide which family to spend the holidays with is by simply switching back and forth. The classic example is going to see your family for Thanksgiving and your intended spouse’s family for Christmas (or vice versa). This can work especially well if you switch which holiday is spent with which family each year. This is also especially advantageous if you will need to travel to see one or both families.

, For instance, you attend your partner’s family for Thanksgiving and plan to spend Christmas with your family. However, your fiancé’s sister has a baby on Christmas Eve. It’s only fair that your partner may want to be with them.In this case, you may want to visit your own family while your fiancé visits their own again. You could also go and see their family again too, and plan to spend the holidays next year with your partner and your family.
Otherwise stated, factor in extenuating circumstances. Other unforeseen issues may also arise, such as illness. It’s important to understand that not all of your holiday planning will go according to plan.

, Since you and your fiancé will be in an especially celebratory mood - and that each of your families will be excited to congratulate you both - it may be the perfect year to host everyone in your home or city.Be aware that hosting requires a lot of work - and can lead to a good bit of stress. That said, it can also be incredibly rewarding to bring both of your families together, especially in anticipation of your forthcoming marriage.
Before committing to hosting, sit down with your partner and talk about all of the logistics. You probably won’t have room for everyone at your place, so who gets the guest bedroom?
Have visitors help with the logistics by bringing dishes or chairs. Create an email list or shared document in Google drive to handle any organizational info.

Split single-day holidays into multiple events.,
Make decisions about religious worship as a couple.,
Recognize each other’s different religious practices.,
Spend specific evenings apart if necessary.",How to Survive the Holidays As a Newly Engaged Couple2," If both of your families live within easy traveling distance, you may be able to spend certain holidays with both sides. For instance, it’s easy to spend Christmas Eve with one side and Christmas day with the other, but what do you do about Thanksgiving? It may be possible to do half of the day with one family and half with the other, but this can lead to complications and stress about keeping a schedule.Consider asking a family to celebrate a day later, if possible, or split the day's traditions without committing to a full event at both homes.


For instance, maybe the two of you can join Joe's family earlier in the day to watch the annual Thanksgiving Day Lions game, then head to your own family's Thanksgiving dinner.
Be careful not to set a demanding precedent the first year, or you may be expected to repeat it. Keep things manageable, and remember that compromise will be needed on both sides.

, Either you or your future spouse may associate one of the holidays with special spiritual significance. Even if you both adhere to the same formal doctrine you may need to make a decision about something like which place of worship to attend.Further, one of your families may consider it significant that you and your partner worship with them.
The decision about where, how, and with whom to worship is equally up to your and your future spouse - and no one else. That said, if one of you are more dependent on religious belief, or are from a family that takes worship seriously, it may be worth defaulting to these criteria regarding decisions about holiday events.

, In the course of dating your future spouse, you have hopefully gotten to know a lot about how they see the world, and about whatever religious affiliations they have. Even so, the increased proximity to one another’s lives that a marriage proposal may bring may also bring with it newfound realizations about how seriously each of you feel about one or the other’s chosen belief system.Take care to acknowledge any dates and plans that may be especially meaningful to your partner. Especially if you are uncertain about specific holidays or events, ask something like, “Which of the upcoming events are important to you, and are there some I should make a point of planning to attend with you?” Have this conversation before you agree to plans with either family.
That said, neither of you should feel obligated to attend or adhere to all of the religious practices one of you decides to partake in. In this and every realm of your relationship, balance and communication are vital.

, It may not be ideal, but if a certain scenario requires you and your future spouse to be apart for part of the holidays, don’t let it wreck your cheer. This may be likely in certain scenarios, especially if one of you have to travel substantially to visit family and your partner has tight professional obligations closer to home.If it so happens that you have to be apart, be sure to video chat with one another and allow your intended spouse to say hello to everyone you’re celebrating with. Consider exchanging plans about when everyone will see each other again too.

Articulate the events that matter to you.,
Don’t be surprised by the holiday blues.,
Remind each other why you're getting married.",How to Survive the Holidays As a Newly Engaged Couple3," In terms of events, locations, company, etc., there are likely components of every holiday season that each of you hold dear. As such, it’s important to talk with your partner about what each of you want to prioritize. You may find that one of you deeply value spending Thanksgiving with your family, and the other is all about family Christmas. In such a scenario, the holiday planning may simply take care of itself.And if it doesn't, you'll still have a better understanding of how to compromise.

, Even if the planning goes perfectly, everyone’s religious and political inclinations line up, and your first shooting expedition with your partner’s dad is injury free, you may find yourself missing your own family on a holiday you spend away from them. This is entirely natural, especially if you’re accustomed to spending all of the holidays with your own family.When it comes down to it, getting married is a big deal, and it means there will be lots of changes in your life. Remind yourself why you’re getting married in the first place, and try to enjoy a holiday with their family as much as you hope they will enjoy future holidays with yours!
The holidays hold sadness for some families, for instance if they are a reminder of absent relatives. It is important to inform your partner about anything like this in advance. Keeping secrets will only make the event stressful and complicated.

, There's no time of the year that's quite as romantic as the holidays. That said, they can also be emotionally tumultuous, with heavy social schedules, stressful travels, and egg-nog seasoned conversations. Make sure you and your partner get to celebrate the last holiday season before you make it official with at least a few moments alone together.


Be sure to tell each other exactly why it is that you're looking forward to spending all the rest of your days together. Be creative, and don't worry about being too sappy - especially while sitting next to the tree.

Work together.,
Take a break together.,
Just say “no.” Although it may be difficult, you don’t have to attend every holiday function in which you receive an invitation.,
Check in with your spouse.,
Stay in touch over long distances.",How to Stay Close to Your Spouse During the Holidays1," The holidays are full of extra errands, volunteer duties, and chores. Your best intentions could still leave you and your spouse left with mostly ""Hi's"" and ""Bye's"" over the holiday season. Don't let busy work or family schedules stop you from getting some alone time. You can actually take advantage of the busyness to plan mutual activities.


For instance you and your spouse can volunteer at a soup kitchen during the holiday. Or, you can ask the in-laws to babysit while you go out together and shop for the kids and other family members. Even if the only alone time you can find includes running errands or wrapping presents, find time to do something with just the two of you.;
, It’s easy to overbook yourself during the holidays with parties, shopping, and spending time with your loved ones. One of the most important things you can do to stay close with your spouse, however, is to make time for yourselves. Taking a break from the hustle and bustle is not only good for your stress level, but it can allow you and your spouse to reconnect. Sneak away for a date night or two, or spend a quiet but special evening in.If you have kids, hire a babysitter. Many people need extra cash during the holidays, so you can help a friend or neighbor at the same time you help yourself.

, Going to what seems like a never-ending array of parties can take a toll on your relationship, as you may not feel like you have any down-time, which can affect your mindset and stress level. Kindly pass on some invites and your marriage will likely thank you. Many couple take turns with different families or friend groups, alternating each year.


You may feel bad or fearful about saying no to your friends and family, but if they truly love you, they will understand. Simply say, “Thank you so much for inviting us to your party, but we sadly will not be able to make it.”
Write sincere thank you notes to anyone whose events you cannot attend. If you are questioned further, graciously tell the person that your schedule is jam-packed full of holiday plans, and you just don’t think you’ll have the time to swing by. It’s the truth, and someone who is truly your friend shouldn’t make you feel bad about it. , It’s easy to get so caught up in the holiday spirit that you forget to ask your spouse how they’re doing. This quick and effortless gesture can really mean a lot to a partner who is overwhelmed, feeling run down, or isn’t feeling like themselves during the holidays. Touching base can also keep you in tune with your spouse, which can help you stay close.


If you're doing holiday shopping with friends or family, take a few minutes to call your spouse just to say ""Hi."" Send them a photo of anything funny you see, or make a note to tell them about it later.
Remember to talk about things other than holiday responsibilities. Connect over shared passions, and stay up to date on each other's lives.

, Video conference with your spouse if they are deployed or otherwise unable to be with you. Chances are, you’re both feeling very alone, and if you can’t be together in the physical sense, staying in contact through technology is the next best thing.


Do this as often as possible and you’ll increase your chances of being connected during the holidays. This is especially helpful if you have children. Encourage your spouse to read a holiday story or poem, or have the call going while they open presents."

Talk to your spouse about what the holidays mean to you.,
Include each other’s families.,
Make new traditions with your spouse.",How to Stay Close to Your Spouse During the Holidays2," The holidays are all about tradition. To keep them going, sit down with your spouse and explain the traditions you would like to uphold. Talking about what is important to you and what the holidays mean to you can give your spouse a better understanding about who you are.


Collaborate with your spouse and make a list of traditions you want to maintain. They can be traditions you experienced as a child, such as baking cookies, caroling, visiting assisted living homes, and the like.
Combine your lists and decide which you want to put in place moving forward. You may not have the time nor ability to implement every tradition you want to uphold, so stay flexible and be considerate of which your spouse really wants to hold on to., Dealing with in-laws can be less than pleasant. However, if including them in your holidays means a lot to your spouse or children, consider putting your preferences aside and allow them to be a part of this meaningful time of the year. Talk to your spouse about how much you want your family to be involved, as well.


Talk to your spouse about any problems you anticipate so that you can develop a plan together. If you need them to do the heavy lifting as far as entertaining their family, let them know.
Prepare for a good amount of compromise. Maybe both families can meet for part of the day, or one family can agree to letting you show up after the holiday dinner for other family traditions., The best part about traditions is you can always create new ones. While upholding traditions from your past is great, there’s something special about making traditions that you experience with only your spouse or kids. Brainstorm with your spouse and children about new traditions you’d like to create. Acting out these traditions will create a strong and meaningful bond.Don't be afraid to try various things and see what you like. Talk about them afterward and see which ones you want to hold on to.

Create a budget and stick to it.,
Create experiences instead of buying expensive presents.,
Make homemade gifts if your budget is constricted.",How to Stay Close to Your Spouse During the Holidays3," One of the most common causes of fighting among married couples is money, and this doesn’t change during the holidays. In fact, it can become worse.


Make a budget you are both comfortable with before you go shopping and commit to it. Not arguing about your finances during the holidays can prevent extra stress and help you stay connected., Your spouse may appreciate an expensive watch the first time it is placed on their wrist, but chances are, by this time next year, it will be forgotten. Spending those resources on sharing experiences together, however, will likely create lifelong memories. Doing things together as a family will also have a positive effect on your kids, which in turn, can make you and your spouse closer.


Spend your money on tickets to an amusement park that features light displays, or check out a critically-acclaimed holiday show. These experiences are much more gratifying than material objects, and allow you and your spouse to spend quality time together., The holidays aren’t about who can buy the most expensive presents. They are about spending time with those you love the most. Spending money you can’t afford on presents will only strain your relationship with your spouse. Instead, make presents that your loved ones will appreciate. Doing this with your spouse can create a happy memory and won’t break the bank.


Creating handmade holiday cards, clothing, or crafts, or giving your friends or loved ones pictures of you and your family are cost-effective and meaningful presents that can be treasured for years, and make just as much of an impact as gifts you spend a lot of money on. "

Toast the retiree.,
Include other unique and personalized entertainment.",How to Plan a Retirement Party," The more help you can get planning the party, the less you will have to stress about covering every aspect of the event on your own. Family members and personal friends may be able to provide a different perspective on the retiree than colleagues, so be sure to include them in the party planning if possible. In particular, ensure that you include the retiree’s significant other (if he or she has one) in the party planning.


First and foremost, determine if the retiree would enjoy a retirement party. If you don’t know the retiree well, ask a family member or colleague who is a better friend of the retiring employee. Not everyone enjoys a big party, and in this case, a gift certificate to a restaurant where the retiree can have a quiet dinner with a significant other or a friend may be a more appropriate send-off.;
, A budget will ensure that you keep finances under control and avoid breaking the bank for the party. You will need to consider if you will be required to pay for the venue, and you will definitely want to include a gift for the employee who is leaving.


Set your budget and stick to it. When you finalize a budget for the party, you may be able to present it to someone at work (either an employee responsible for company finances or a committee responsible for delegation of money to events outside of the workplace) to see if they are willing to cover any of the costs.
You will likely need to collect money from colleagues for the event. This amount can vary, but the requested amount should be reasonable for all employees. You can also let people know that they can donate more toward defraying the cost of the party if they want.

, For example, you may want to invite a lot of people if you work for a large company, so you might need to book a more price-efficient venue. On the other hand, if you want to plan a fancy dinner at a restaurant, you may only be able to invite a handful of colleagues and friends.


There is no right or wrong way to prioritize for a retirement party. Your “party priorities” list will depend largely on the size and general atmosphere of your company, as well as the personality and relationships of the retiree.

, This guest list should include those people who are important to the employee. In addition to a spouse or partner, don't forget to invite the retiree's children. You may want to ask the person closest to the retiree for help making this list to ensure that no one important is forgotten.


In addition to family and friends, make sure that no one important in the office is forgotten. You don’t want to create an uncomfortable situation in the workplace by selectively inviting some while leaving others out. If this is the case due to budgetary constraints, you may want to explain this to the people who are not invited. A simple “we’ve chosen only to invite colleagues that have worked with Sam for more than five years because of our budget restrictions” may be helpful to avoid any hurt feelings.

, The venue can be as simple as a conference room at work, as personal as the house of a coworker, as big as a church hall or other public space, or as small as a table at a restaurant. The venue will largely depend on the set budget as well as the “party priorities” (most specifically, how many people you want to invite and whether or not you want food to be provided).


Consider renting a private space so that people are more likely to be able to make speeches and participate in party activities about the retiree. For example, if you decide to hold the retirement party at a restaurant, see if they have a private room that you can book for that afternoon or evening.

, The invitation should include information about who the party is honoring, whether the party is a surprise, where the party will be held, what kind of food will be provided, how long the party will run, what gifts are suggested, if there is a specific theme or expected dress, and if there is convenient parking and/or public transportation (or even carpools) to the party.Invitations specific for retirement parties are available online- a simple Google search will provide you with some options.


If someone in your office is particularly good at art or calligraphy, you may want to design and produce your own invitations. This can also help save money that can then be used toward other aspects of the party.

, Choose something that is appropriate and emulates the type of person the retiree is. Whether it is a material possession, tickets to an event, a gift card to a favorite store or restaurant, or another unique idea, putting thought into a gift for the retiree is an important part of planning a retirement party as it will serve as a reminder of the retiree’s career.


If you have a party theme, take it into consideration when getting a gift. For example, if traveling is the retiree's next endeavor, then opt for a set of luggage that is personalized.
You will likely want to include a photo album (or something personal that commemorates the employee’s time at a company) as part of the gift. Include photographs of the retiree and peers throughout the years, along with messages from work colleagues and superiors. This can be put together as a “memory book.”
For a unique gift, consider making your gift a donation to the retiree’s favorite charity.You can write directly on the invitation to donate to a specific charity, and have people donate whatever amount they feel is appropriate.

, Choose a theme that highlights the retiree’s interests.You may want to choose one theme (think travel, golf, the outdoors, cars, etc.) or you may want to choose several different interests of the honored guest as a way to highlight the many dimensions of his or her life. As an alternative, you can pick a popular theme for retirement parties.


Some popular suggestions for retirement party themes include “His or Her Hire Year” (where you feature clothing, music, television, movies, toys, and popular events from the year that the retiree was hired), “Company in Mourning” (where you ask everyone to dress in black and have them “pay their respects” for losing an important employee), and the popular “Permanent Vacation” (which can be a beach or luau-themed party complete with a Hawaiian shirt dress code and tropical drinks)., While you don’t want to have a minute-by-minute schedule of how the party should proceed, you will want to set aside a dedicated time for party activities such as speeches or games. Making a program can help inform your guests of your desired schedule. Print out the program on a piece of card stock and add pictures of the retiree for a personalized touch.


Consider how you want the event to flow. You may want to break up different courses of the meal with short speeches or songs that honor the employee, or you may want to schedule any speeches in the first part of the event so that everyone can relax for the remainder of the party.

, This person should be tasked with keeping the party on schedule. His or her responsibilities will include announcing when it is time to eat, encouraging guests to join in on party activities, and introducing any speakers. You may want to explore the possibility of renting or borrowing a microphone for your emcee, but this depends largely on your venue and other details of the party.

, If you have it in the budget, and if the status of the retiree calls for it, commission a professional photographer to take pictures of the event. Otherwise, designate a guest (preferably another colleague) to be the event photographer or videographer. Documenting the retirement party will ensure that it is a fond memory for the retiree for years to come. Make sure to provide access to these photos to the retiree after the party!

, If you choose to hold the party at a place that does not provide food, you may wish to make it a “potluck” party, where everyone brings a dish and is free to eat whatever they’d like. This can be a great option if you are particularly strapped for cash when it comes down to organizing the food for the party.


Make a sign-up list so that everyone can see what others’ are bringing. Try to make several different columns (including appetizers, mains, salads, and desserts) so that you don’t end up with twelve platters of vegetables and dip. You can also make suggestions and have guests sign up for a pre-suggested dish.

, Having the party catered will enable you to hold the celebration in almost any venue that you want.


Call several local caterers to see if they require a minimum number of guests at the party or money that must be spent at the caterer. You want to ensure that you stick to your budget when planning the food for the party.
Peruse your menu options, and ensure there is food that your guests would enjoy. You will want to make sure you include vegetarian options and options for those with gluten intolerance. Ask guests to warn you beforehand of any particularly severe food allergies or intolerances so that you can be aware of them when planning the menu.
Call around to find a reasonably priced caterer. It is always advantageous to get several price quotes from several different companies before settling on a caterer. This will help you stick to your pre-set budget.

, If you choose to hold the retirement party at a restaurant, it may be possible to create a “set menu.” This will help you include some of the retiree’s favorite dishes while still providing guests with a selection. In addition, it will help you to guarantee that you stay within budget.


Ask the restaurant if you can temporarily rename your chosen dishes in honor of your retiree. For example, having “Hank’s Holiday Hummus” or “Rosie’s Relaxing Rice and Beans” is a creative and unique way to honor the retiree. If possible, fit in the naming of the dishes with the theme of the party.

, Ask everyone in the room to write something down about the guest of honor based on a particular prompt provided by the party emcee. Invite anyone who would like to speak up one by one, and make sure you have a microphone if you are in a large space.


Make up your own unique prompts tailored to the retiree, or try one of these:

An embarrassing moment I had with Kevin was…
Something I thought I would never tell Kevin was…
The funniest moment I ever had with Kevin was…
The time I was most impressed by Kevin was…



, You will want to include a whole history (such as his first job, his first boss, etc.) and have everyone try to guess the correct answers (you may want to make this multiple choice). The person who gets the most correct answers wins a prize.

, Ask the retiree's superior to give a short toast that emulates thanks for work done and regret for the employee leaving. A toast should be solemn, but should also be positive at the same time. It is not a time to “roast” the employee, but a time for genuine appreciation for a job well done.


Other guests may also want to stand up and say something about the retiree. You can either do an “open mic” session, where people are free to stand up and briefly say what they would like, or you can ask people to let you know when they RSVP to the party invite if they would like to make a short speech recognizing the retiree.

, The entertainment should be based on what the retiree would appreciate. You can have coworkers sing a farewell song or perform a humorous sketch about the retiree. The most important aspect of retirement party activities is to make them feel as personalized as possible so that the retiree recognizes how special he or she was to the company.

Pick out a sentimental or commemorative item.Whether you choose to go with a gift of sentiment between the two of you or has sentiment that relates to their career, they will appreciate the personal touch.,
Add a note or card.",How to Pick a Retirement Gift for a Parent1," Sometimes the best gift is a heartfelt one. If you choose a sentimental or commemorative gift it doesn't necessarily have to be the most practical. If you have shared memories or experiences, a gift that hearkens to it will be much appreciated.


This will often be a recurring experience. For instance, a yearly family vacation to the same place.
It can also commemorate a specific, one-time experience, like a high school graduation trip that you went on with them.;
, Oftentimes, a gift that commemorates their career can have a sentimental touch too.For instance, if you parent was a pilot, a high-end model of the primary aircraft that they flew during their career might be a good gift.,


One option is to pick out a commemorative item, such as a plaque or a framed photo that those at the retirement party can sign.Designing a gift that commemorates the time he or she spent at the company can be a nice touch., Even though your gift is sentimental, words expressing your feelings are important too. Express how much they mean to you in the card, and perhaps add an anecdote about how they were a role model and taught you the importance of working hard.

Place the pages inside your scrapbook binder in the order you prefer.",How to Make a Retirement Scrapbook," The number of photos you have is likely to decide the size of your project. Ask your colleagues to donate photos of the person to the project.


Scan old photographs into the computer. Print new copies of your digital version so that you don't ruin the originals. Return the old photographs to friends or family members.;
, For a large scrapbook, choose a 12 by 12 inch scrapbook binder. However, you can choose a much smaller format.

, You can either type up these quotes or use the signed notes as a heartfelt memento.

, Place them in piles according to a theme, event or chronological period of the person's life.

, Each page or group of pages will need a title to place the reader in the correct setting or time. Writing titles is a big part of artful scrapbooking.


Some sample retirement scrapbooking titles include: ""The Golden Years,"" ""Over the Hill,"" ""The Age of Innocence"" or ""Aged to Perfection.""

, Scrapbooking can be an intensive project, especially if you want to fill many pages in a 12 by 12 inch binder. Invite others to glue and arrange pages, while sharing the cost.

, Scrapbooking stores, craft stores and online craft stores all carry themed paper that you can use to illustrate your theme. For example, if the retiree likes wine, you can buy a wine themed paper to use behind your photographs.

, Use acid free glue for all photographs and paper. This will help the project to last longer. Allow the pages to dry after you glue paper, mat, photos, titles and other elements to the page.


Avoid using large amounts of glue, because it can wrinkle your pages. Some people prefer quick drying spray glues to avoid wrinkles.

, Use a calligraphy pen to get a permanent and bold letter quality. You can also buy letter stickers, if you prefer a ""printed' look.


Practice writing your titles on scrap paper before you write them directly onto your scrapbook pages. You can try a number of different styles before settling on the 1 you like. You may choose to keep this lettering style for a more uniform project.

, Decorate the outside of the binder with a title and a picture of the retiree.

Replace cooking or baking with craft time.,
Ask for favors.,
Say ""No,"" if your schedule is full.",How to Spend the Holidays Productively2," Reserving time to relax and unwind, without the stress of work or extended family can improve your health and your motivation. Don't forget to schedule time for yourself.

, One of the best ways to be productive is to ensure your work time is not spent trying to juggle vacation plans, present shopping, recipes and schedules. Make a preemptive plan in November to schedule your personal life before your work life, and you may find motivation to work hard while you are at the office, so you won't have to stay late.

, You will sleep better if you don't have dozens of tasks you have to do right before work.

, This is a notorious time-killer at work. However, if you plan to spend an hour every week after or before work doing this, you are less likely to think it should be done at work.

, While holiday visits can be enjoyable, people often stay too long or drink too much. If you set a time limit, you are less likely to overindulge, or get overwhelmed by too much company.

, You may feel overwhelmed by all the cooking or baking that is planned. You can ask someone to bring a dish, eat out or get take out. Look for healthy or exotic options that aren't part of the normal holiday fare.

, Adults and children love to create things. Instead of making too many sweets, use the time to create your decorations.

, If you feel overloaded at work or home, there are usually a few people nearby who would be happy to help. Instead of overloading yourself, ask a friend or family member to cook a dish for Thanksgiving dinner or pick the kids up from school.

, You don't need to be a part of every party or planning committee you are asked to join during the holiday season. Choose carefully according to the things you enjoy and those that help you network.

Combine exercise with family fun.,
Make an alternative workout plan for the holidays.",How to Spend the Holidays Productively3," Plan family outings, like skiing, skating, snowshoeing, sledding or swimming, that are exercise oriented.

, Accept that your hectic holiday schedule will change your availability to exercise. Fitness should be a priority, but you are more likely to do it if it doesn't interrupt fun activities.


Avoid signing up for fitness classes during late November and December, but choose an activity like hiking, walking or swimming that can be done at any time of the day.
Replace evening workouts with morning or lunch workouts. Most holiday parties and children's activities take place after school or work. Just as you are more productive at work in the morning, you are also likely to exercise more if you do it earlier in the day, before other things come up.
When you don't have time to do anything else, walk. Plan a 30 minute walk after dinner or in place of a television show. Try to stay as active as possible to avoid weight gain, sleeplessness and even depression.
Create an at-home routine, in case you don't have time to go to the gym. You can include free-weights, crunches, yoga poses and pilates moves that target the same areas. Lay out a mat and exercise for 15 to 20 minute each morning.

Think about what they enjoy doing.,
Think about what they haven't done, but want to.,
Select an experience.Whether as simple as a trip to a weekend bed and breakfast or as exotic plane tickets to Europe, there are plenty of experiences that you can give, depending on their interests.They might not have a physical gift, but the memories will last forever.

,
Organize a charitable event.",How to Pick a Retirement Gift for a Parent2," Perhaps your parent enjoys wine tours. Buying them a tour pass for a high-end winery might be something they really enjoy. If they love live music, buy them tickets to their favorite band.

, Sometimes a parent might have a lifelong dream, such as a trip to Rome, a cruise, or visiting the Grand Canyon. Oftentimes either career or children get in the way of these dreams. If you know of something they've always wanted to do, now is the perfect time to make it happen.

,, If you run out of other idea and your parent has a social or civic cause they are devoted to, you could organize a charitable event or volunteer day in their name. If all else fails and the scheduling for an actual experience doesn't work out, you could also consider sending a donation in their name. "

Think about your parent's hobbies.,
Choose tools or equipment.,
Buy a gift card.,
Add a personal note.",How to Pick a Retirement Gift for a Parent3," If your parent enjoys a hobby, they may appreciate a gift for their hobby.Sewing, fishing, car repair, fitness, golf, the list goes on.If they had a favorite hobby, odds are that in retirement they will have far more time to enjoy it. Consider getting them set for retirement with some hobby equipment that they have always wanted.

, This option will often go along with the brainstorming you did on their hobby. New golf clubs or high end fishing rods, new sewing software, garage gym or yoga studio equipment, or even a new laptop.

Buying something centered around their interests is both thoughtful and practical, When all else fails, you can go with the old and reliable choice - a gift card.If you buy it for a specific store, be sure that they frequent that store often. Prepaid Visa cards or Amazon cards are a good choice if you want their spending choices to be flexible.

, No matter what you get them, you'll want to add another personal touch by getting them a card as well. Express how much they mean to you in the card, and try to add an anecdote about how they were a role model and taught you the importance of working hard.

Manage your expectations.,
Make a budget.,
Think about your identity.,
Set goals for yourself.",How to Enjoy Retirement1," To start, you'll want to manage your expectations. If you're anxious to get out of a stifling career, you may think retirement will be glorious. However, it's very normal for the transition into retirement to be stressful. Try to keep your expectations realistic, and expect some sadness in the early days of retirement.A lot of identity is tied to career. It's normal to feel lost and confused initially during retirement. These feelings are normal, and will pass with time. Expecting to feel some sadness early on can lessen its blow. If you go into retirement certain you'll automatically feel happy and fulfilled, you may be more upset or frustrated by the difficulty of the transition.
You should also expect that you will not do all you want to do right away. Do not expect to jump into retirement and immediately begin reading all the books you want to read, traveling everywhere you wanted to go, and getting into a ton of hobbies. It's okay to plan for some downtime, initially, as you adjust to the transition.;
, Even with a good pension, you will be taking in significantly less money in retirement. Look into your savings, personal assets, and monthly pension to get a sense of how much money you can reasonably spend each month. Knowing your budget ahead of time can help you feel relaxed about money, allowing you to enjoy your retirement more.If you're on a strict budget, you can plan for low cost activities. Try to take advantage of senior discounts at low-priced local restaurants, for example. You can also look into downsizing. If you'd be okay with a smaller home or less belongings, selling some of your old things can give you extra money for retirement.
You can also consider finding a way to earn small amounts of money each month. You could try a part time job. Many retirees enjoy small, low pressure part time work. Things like tutoring, substitute teaching, dog-walking, and pet sitting will keep you busy and feeling fulfilled. They will also give you a bit of extra income to spend.

, A lot of one's identity is tied up in work. You may feel very defined by your job. You may see yourself as a lawyer, or a teacher, or an engineer. Retirement can be jarring, as this role is suddenly absent. It can help to think about your new role prior to retirement. This can give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment, allowing you to better enjoy yourself.You perhaps once thought of yourself as an achiever, a breadwinner, and independent. Even if you've retired with relative security, you may feel a loss of independence and purpose in retirement. Try to think about new roles you can fill.
In retirement, you're now a valued community member. As you've lived a long, fulfilling life people may come to you for advice and guidance. If you're married, you can see yourself as a valued partner for your spouse. If you have children, you can provide them with guidance and support.

, You should have some goals going into retirement. This can allow you to better enjoy yourself. You will suddenly have an onslaught of free time, so you want to plan ways to fill that time. Have a sense of what you want to do going into retirement.You may want to have some very specific goals based off of your general interests. For example, a general goal may be something like, ""I want to get more involved in my community."" How can you make this more specific? What are some concrete ways you can get involved?
From a vague goal, hammer out specifics. For example, ""I want to volunteer at the children's hospital 3 times a week"" or ""I want to start regularly attending town hall meetings.""

Take up new hobbies.,
Travel.,
Get involved in your community.,
Join a cause.,
Continue your education.,
Accept occasional downtime.",How to Enjoy Retirement2," Retirement presents you with the invaluable opportunity to try something new. There were probably many hobbies and interests you never pursued when busy with work, family, and other obligations. Try to look into these hobbies in your retirement.Think about a hobby you were always interested in pursuing. Maybe you always wanted to try, say, horseback riding. See if you can take classes in your local area.
Look into senior centers. If your area has a senior center, they may offer classes for the recently retired. See if any classes stand out to you. As retirement is a time to look back and reflect on past experience, a memoir writing class may be a good idea.

, Many people look forward to traveling in retirement. With unlimited vacation time, you'll have a chance to visit many places you never got to see during your working years. Try planning a few trips for your early years of retirement. Seek out places you've always wanted to visit, but never had the time.Travel need not be expensive. If you're on a tight budget, a weekend trip to a nearby beach town or city can be great.
However, if you do have the money, consider a more elaborate trip. Many retirees enjoy taking long cruises to see other parts of the world after retirement.

, Community involvement can be a great way to feel happy or fulfilled in retirement. There were probably local organizations you always wanted to help out, but never had the time. Retirement is your chance to branch out and become a more active member of your community.Choose community involvement that caters to your specific personality. If you're a lifelong animal lover, you may benefit from volunteering at a local shelter. If you love kids, get involved with the local children's library.
As with most aspects of retirement, it may take you some time to adjust to becoming a community member. It's okay to give yourself a few weeks, or months, to manage your emotions before getting involved., Is there a particular cause that inspires you? Maybe you always wanted to help with a local political party, but never felt you had the time. Retirement can be an invaluable opportunity for you to join a cause. Stress from retirement often stems from a lack of purpose or fulfillment. Working for change with people with common values is a great way for your life to feel meaningful. This can help you enjoy your retired years., Many retirees take retirement as a time to learn. If there's a subject you were always curious about, retirement can be the time to study that subject. You can get a library card and educate yourself, or you can take other approaches to furthering your education.You can take some kind of classes in retirement. Maybe you want to learn to play a particular musical instrument, for example, or learn an art form like drawing. Do not hesitate to look into local classes in your area.
You can also audit courses at local colleges. You may also be able to enroll, for a fee, in a course of your choosing. You can take classes on subjects that always interested you, but were never relevant to your field. If you were always fascinated by world history, but worked as an engineer, consider taking a history course at a local college.

, Many people feel compelled to fill their retired years with a constant influx of activity. This is not realistic, and can cause undo stress if you try to force it. As you've been working for decades, it's okay to give yourself downtime as well.Allow yourself to sleep in a few days a week. Don't force yourself out of bed if you'd rather linger until noon or later.
Spend a few days a week just enjoying leisurely activities. Go for long walks. Read for pleasure. Have a meal at a nice restaurant. Do not worry about filling each and every day with activity. It's okay to embrace downtime now and again.

See friends regularly.,
Reach out to old friends.,
Get on social media.,
Spend time with family.",How to Enjoy Retirement3," As much of socializing happens at work, you may lose touch with some friends in retirement. It's important, however, that you work to stay social. Humans are social creatures by nature, and you'll need social support from friends and family members in retirement.Work on maintaining connections from work. While you may not see work friends every day anymore, you can try to meet outside of work. Make a point of getting cocktails with friends from work a few times a month.
You can also try to make new friends. Many people feel their friend making years are over in retirement, but this is not the case. Traveling, volunteering, taking classes, and joining a senior community center can all help you make new friends., As time goes by, you tend to lose touch with certain people. Friends from college, high school, old jobs, and other places fall to the wayside. Take retirement as an opportunity to reconnect. It can be fun and fulfilling to spend time with forgotten friends.


Try to call up an old friend on the phone, or write him or her a letter or e-mail. It may feel a bit awkward, especially if a lot of time as passed, but your friend will probably be happy to hear from you. People understand life gets in the way, and some friendships taper off.
Consider going to visit an old friend. You can take a trip to your hometown, for example, and see any friends that still live there. If you've been meaning to visit your old college roommate in Seattle for years, take your retirement as the chance to do so.

, Social media can help you stay connected during retirement. As you won't be going out for work, you may not have a chance to stay up-to-date on the lives of friends. Creating a Facebook account can help you stay close to those around you, and allow you to interact with others online. If you do not already have social media accounts, it's a good idea to make some in retirement.

, Retirement can be a great time to spend time with your family. Take a trip to visit out of state relatives. Offer to babysit your grandchildren. If you have older grandchildren, make time to call them each week.Many retirees consider moving closer to family. If you'd like to stay close to your kids and grandchildren, you may want to consider getting a small home or apartment close by.

Start planning well in advance.,
Decide when to tell your boss.,
Schedule a private meeting for the end of the day.,
Ask your boss about how to tell the rest of the staff.,
Write a letter to your boss officially announcing your intention to retire.,
Tell people personally.,
Include important information in all correspondence.,
Express your appreciation and well wishes.,
Time it right.,
Keep it informal.,
Consider throwing a party to make the big announcement.",How to Announce Your Retirement," The decision to retire is very significant, and you should start planning for your retirement at least six months in advance.This allows you time to make sure you are comfortable with your decision before making things formal, tie up any loose ends, and use any remaining vacation days.
Be sure to familiarize yourself with your company's retirement policies, and download compensation statements and benefits information from your company's website while you still have company log-in credentials.These policies will also let you know if your company has a rule about how far in advance you must notify your employer and/or human resources office, which will likely determine when you take the next steps.;
, Its important that you follow company protocol, but most of the time you will have some leeway regarding when to tell your immediate supervisor of your impending retirement.


Be cautious about announcing too early. Doing so can signal to your employer that you are not as invested, and you might be passed over for projects or asked to leave earlier to make room for your replacement.Similarly, if you are in a supervisory position, your employees may not listen to your directives or respect your authority.
If you do fear any negative repercussions of your announcement, it might be best to wait until the last minute as per your employee handbook. Just as with any other position you have left in your career, regardless of your handbook, you should tell your plans to your boss no later than three weeks prior to your intended date of retirement. The ""three week notice"" is the bare minimum of time required to find, hire and train a replacement.
If you have a senior position or one that is difficult to replace, it is not unusual to give three to six months of notice, to give your company time to locate and train a suitable replacement.Think about the relationship you have with your supervisor and company, and if that relationship is important to maintain in your retirement. Being thoughtful of the position your company will be in when you retire can go a long way in maintaining good feelings on both sides.

, This will ensure that you have a bit of time to discuss your plans but that you are not interrupting your boss's other work responsibilities.


The level of formality of this meeting will depend on the relationship with your boss or supervisor. If you have a strictly professional relationship, the announcement will be similarly formal. If you have a more friendly relationship, however, the announcement can be less rigid and more conversational.
If you have not finalized your plans but are giving the boss the news as a courtesy, be sure to say so. Simply say, ""I am thinking about retiring in June-- but I have not quite made up my mind. When is the absolute latest you will need to know?""If the plans are finalized, say, ""I have been thinking about this for a long time, and I've decided it is time to retire. I will be retiring at the end of June.""
Either way, let your boss know that you want to make the transition as smooth as possible.

, Some bosses have a policy that they themselves will make a formal announcement of your retirement to the rest of the staff, but some prefer that you announce to your coworkers yourself. If you have a preference, be sure to let him or her know.


If the boss will send a memo, post a bulletin, or make an announcement, you will not need to announce you're retiring to the rest of the staff in a formal capacity.
If you actually prefer to tell all (or some) colleagues yourself, ask the boss to wait to announce until you've had a chance to talk to these important people yourself.
Even though you might not be planning to take another job or go back to work following retirement, the current economy is unpredictable and it is smart to ask your supervisors for three letters of recommendation just in case of contingency. It is better to do this now while your excellent work ethic is fresh in their minds than to wait until you need the letters, when they may have moved to other companies and be harder to track down., The letter is a formality and it can be brief, but should state the date of your retirement.


Give the letter to your boss after you have verbally told her of your plans.
Even though you've made your intentions clear verbally, human resources will require a formal letter to file in their records. Payroll will also need the information to make sure you're given all relevant sick days or other compensation.
Be sure to follow up with human resources immediately to find out what paperwork will be required and when it is due.

, It is considerate to let your co-workers and staff know that you're retiring verbally or by personal phone call or email, rather than via a company-wide memo. Giving a personal touch to the message helps your co-workers feel valued and goes a long way in maintaining your friendships into retirement.


Inform friends and close coworkers after you've told your boss. News often spreads, even if you ask to keep the information quiet, and you want your boss to be the first to know.
If your boss is holding a meeting to tell significant co-workers of your retirement, consider writing emails to all other co-workers and staff, and saving them to automatically send from your email service at the end of the scheduled meeting. That way everyone will find out at the same time, and no one will feel as if they've been slighted., Whether you are drafting an email to human resources, a formal letter to your boss, or a note to your secretary, certain pieces of information should be included to simplify the process and avoid confusion.


Include the exact date of your retirement in all correspondence. Doing so helps avoid speculation and simplifies work for others who depend on you, since they know exactly what day you will no longer be working.
Add a forwarding address if it is different from what the company has on file. If you don't pick up your final paycheck on your last day, the company can mail it or any other relevant information to the address provided.
Include other contact information (phone number, email or address) should you want to stay in contact with anyone from the office after retirement.

, Rather than sending a direct and impersonal notice, kind and personalized letters to coworkers and your replacement, if he or she has already been hired, will ensure that you are remembered as a thoughtful coworker.


Retirement letters are a chance to say your last goodbyes to the company, and they should be sincere and genuine in their offer of well wishes.
If you plan to maintain relationships with your co-workers once you've retired, now can be a good time to personally invite them for a barbeque or family dinner scheduled for after your retirement. That way you can ensure that you maintain the relationship and are not forgotten.

, Regardless of when you decide to tell your boss and co-workers, you should always plan to tell family and friends after telling those at work.


News travels fast, and it could be awkward or problematic for your boss to hear through the grapevine that you're retiring.
The exception is your spouse and immediate family members or a very trusted friend or mentor. You need people you can talk to about the decision to retire even before you've finalized your plans, so feel free to take those closest to you into your confidence. Just be sure that whoever you tell knows that the information is confidential.

, While announcements to your boss and co-workers need to maintain some level of formality, your announcement to friends and family can be as informal as you like.


A Facebook or other social media post can make the process of announcing simple, since you can tell everyone you know at once. If you use LinkedIn or other career networking sites, be sure to make a note there as well.
Its smart to word your retirement announcement in a way that leaves the door open to future opportunities, especially if you are retiring early in life. Say something like, ""I will be stepping down from my position in June to spend more time with family. I'm looking forward to seeing what the next chapter holds.""Consider making a funny retirement video. Check out Youtube for ideas.

, Invite all your close family and friends, and that way you can tell them in person in a way that is meaningful to you.


You can choose if you want the let them know in advance of the party that it is a retirement party, or you can make a surprise announcement at the party itself.
While throwing a party for yourself might seem impolite, rules on etiquette are changing and most people find a retirement party an exception to that particular rule, especially if its a surprise that you reveal at the party (in which case, no one will have purchased gifts).

Look for a location in a warmer climate that you will be able to continue enjoying the interests and activities that matter to you.The best way to identify whether you’ll be able to engage in the activities and interests that matter to you in a warmer climate is to visit the location you’re’ thinking of retiring to, then trying to do them.
Alternately, you could run a search online that combines a warm-climate location and the interest you enjoy. For example, if you like going to the opera and you’re thinking of retiring to Miami, Florida, you might run a word string like “opera Miami Florida” through the search engine of your choice.

, Before retiring to a warmer climate, you should know a bit about the weather. You might know that the place has warmer weather, but that warmth could become uncomfortable after a bit and may be tied to other, less pleasant climatic phenomenon.For instance, you might reason that Florida has a warmer climate and would therefore be a great place to retire to. But Florida also has a high number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and – consequently – floods.Warmer climates also attract more bugs, including mosquitoes.

, Just because you’re retiring doesn’t mean you need to shrink your social life. When looking for warm-climate locations you’d like to retire, ensure that the place you select offers ample opportunity for social growth and interaction. For instance, you should look for locations that offer:clubs or sports teams
community education classes in art or an academic subject
volunteering opportunities
support groups if you experience loss or illness

, Moving to a warmer climate after you retire should not be premised solely on the desire to move to a warmer climate. Wherever you decide to retire to, you should have several good reasons to move there.For instance, if you want to retire to a warmer climate in a place where you’ll be near your family, have many opportunities for swimming in the ocean, and have access to world-class cultural institutions, you may have a solid basis for retiring to a warmer climate.
No one reason should push you retire to a warmer climate after retiring.

Think about what the cost of living will be.,
Figure out your resources.,
Make a budget.,
Analyze the healthcare available in the warmer climate location.When comparing life in your current location to life in a warmer climate, you should also consider what quality of healthcare you’ll enjoy in the warmer climate.",How to Decide if You Should Retire to a Warmer Climate2," Sometimes it means paying less in taxes. Whatever the case, you should familiarize yourself with the tax code of the location with the warmer climateYou can learn about the tax obligations in various U.S. states using the Small Business Administration’s site at https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/filing-paying-taxes/determine-your-state-tax-obligations.

Don’t forget to find out whether pensions are taxed. Some U.S. states allow certain pensions to remain untaxed.

, In some places with warmer climates, even simple everyday costs like grocery shopping can be expensive.

, Depending on how old you are when you retire, you may or may not be able to collect things like a retirement pension, Social Security or other government-funded retirement income. You might also have investments (stocks, bonds, and securities) or special accounts like 401(K)s or Roth IRAs that you could tap into.

They might be able to identify resources that you did not.

, Once you know the cost of living in the warm-climate place you wish to retire, as well as the resources at your disposal, carefully calculate exactly how much your new lifestyle will cost. Draw up an estimated budget subtracting costs like healthcare, meals (including dining out and grocery shopping), household expenses (rent, utilities, and repairs), debt (credit card or mortgage payments), and transportation costs (bus or taxi fare, oil changes, and gas) from your total monthly available income.Separate your spending into essential spending like taxes, rent, utilities, and groceries from your discretionary spending on things like movies, the opera, vacations, and larger TVs.
If your monthly expenditures exceed your available monthly resources, you should not retire to a warmer climate, or identify a warmer climate you’d like to retire to that has a lower cost of living.

, If the warmer climate has better healthcare than your current location, you might want to retire there. But if the healthcare options in the warmer climate are worse than those in your current location, you should think twice before retiring there.For instance, if you get $10,000 of healthcare coverage in your current location but only $5,000 of healthcare coverage in the warmer climate you’re considering moving to, it’s best to stay put or find a different (but also warm) place to retire to.

Talk to your partner.,
Take your support networks into consideration.,
Consider your transportation options.",How to Decide if You Should Retire to a Warmer Climate4," If you are in a relationship, you should talk to your partner about whether or not you should retire to a warmer climate. Your partner might also want to retire to a warmer climate, but they might not want to. To be respectful to your partner, engage them in conversation about the possibility of moving to a warmer climate when you retire.Since the retirement process – which involves evaluating warm-climate locations, analyzing the financial environment, and moving from one residence to another – can take time, it’s good to have a conversation about retiring to a warmer climate at least 10 to 15 years prior to your expected date of retirement.
To kick off the conversation, you could say to your partner, “Would you like to move to a warmer climate when I retire?”
If your partner says, “No, I am not much interested in retiring to a warmer climate,” you might ask, “Why?” in an open and interested way. Listen carefully to your partner’s explanation. If you agree with their reasoning, say, “I see what you mean. That’s a good point. I hadn’t thought of it like that.”
If your partner says, “Yes, retiring to a warmer climate is something I’ve always dreamed of,” say, “Great. I have a few ideas about warmer climates where we could retire.” Share your list of warm-climate locations with your partner. If they seem interested in any, say, “Why don’t we visit some of these warm-climate locations we’re interested in to determine if we might enjoy retiring there?”

, If you have family, friends, and colleagues whose company you enjoy, you might miss them if you retire to a warmer climate.Before moving to a warmer climate, ask yourself if you would be alright without this support network.If you believe that you don’t need them – or if you never had a support network to begin with – moving to a warmer climate will be easier for you.
But if you believe you will miss your support network and find it hard to build a new one, you might want to reconsider retiring to a warmer climate, or identify a warmer climate where you already have friends, family, and colleagues.
Some people find that staying connected to their support networks via voice-over-IP services (Skype, for instance), phone calls, and e-mails is enough. But remember, nothing can replace the quality time you can spend with your family and friends during face-to-face interactions and experiences.

, If you no longer drive in your retirement, you will need to closely consider your options for transportation when retiring to a warmer climate. Even if you do still drive, there might come a time as you grow older that you are no longer willing or able to. If you doubt that you’ll be able to achieve or maintain the level of mobility you desire when retiring to a warmer climate, you should not do so.For instance, if you relied on rides from friends or family, you must remember that they will not be around to transport you to where you need to go when you retire to a warmer climate.
Bus and taxi services might not be readily available in the warmer climate you retire to.
The best warm-climate locations you could retire to will have robust public transit systems.Research the public transit opportunities in the warm-climate locale you’re thinking of retiring to. For instance, check out the Department of Transportation page of the municipality you’re retiring to and find out if bus routes are offered in the area.
Look for places to rent or buy that are highly walkable and/or offer bike lanes. These places offer greater convenience and opportunities to reduce your carbon footprint.

Keep an eye on your mental health.",How to Adjust to Retirement," It's very normal to feel sad after you retire. You should not expect to go into retirement with elation right away. There will be an adjustment period in which you grieve the loss of your job and livelihood. This is normal. Try to allow yourself to feel what you are feeling without judgment.


If you've been settled into a career for awhile, chances are your job is more than just a job. It provides you with a sense of fulfillment each day. Your social life is likely connected to your work life. While you may not miss the schedule and demands, you may miss the social connections and sense of meaning you gained from work.Remind yourself that it's okay and normal to be sad. Most people who retire experience some level of sadness initially. Allow yourself to feel what you're feeling, good or bad, in the wake of retirement. Keep in mind emotions are not permanent. While you may dislike feelings of sadness you experience, do not expect them to last forever.;
, In retirement, you will no longer have your career as a distraction. Old emotions from your past may resurface.You may find yourself dwelling on past disagreements or feuds with family members and friends. If you have a relationship that needs mending, be proactive. Try to reach out shortly after retirement to avoid letting bitter feelings take over.


It can be hard to reach out to someone who you have a bad history with. Try writing a letter or e-mail, as sometimes difficult conversations can be easier to get out in writing.
Be open to seeing the other person's point of view. There may have been a way you could have behaved differently to salvage a friendship or family relationship.
Apologize. Even if you don't feel you were in the wrong, an apology can go a long way. It shows the opposite party his or her feelings were heard and understood.

, Many people have high expectations going into retirement. You may think you will now have time to do all those things you put off due to your work schedule. However, not working can be stressful. The emotional toll of retirement may prevent you from diving into the plans you've made.


Make a list of what you can reasonably expect to do in the weeks or months following your retirement. Try not to stack your list with too much. Even with your newfound free time, it takes awhile to get into a new project. Remind yourself you're not going to complete all your post-retirement plans within your first six months.Allow yourself to adjust. You may see retirement as your chance to finally read War and Peace, but you may not feel like doing much reading right away. You may need some time to adjust emotionally before taking on new projects or pursuits.

, For many, identity is tied to career. You may see yourself as independent, an achiever, and a good provider. In retirement, you may feel less connected to these roles. Try to take some time to establish a new identity.You're no longer bringing in a paycheck each week. You may feel less useful or fulfilled. However, retirement presents the exciting opportunity for new roles.
You are now a caregiver. You will have more time to look out for elderly relatives and your children or grandchildren. You can also take retirement as an opportunity to get involved in your community. You can see yourself as an active community member as well.As with any aspect of retirement, adjusting to a new identity can take time. Do not be surprised if it takes a few months to accept your new identity in your community and family.

, If you are married, retirement can change your relationship. Couples can become stressed when neither party has a fixed schedule. Prepare for changes in your marriage ahead of time to reduce potential tension.


Form a mutually acceptable plan for your future. You both likely have plans you want to pursue in retirement. What plans can you do together? What plans should you pursue on your own? Decide how much time you want to spend together. While doing activities together is important, it's also important to have some alone time.Talk about the little things as well. You may be looking forward to sleeping in each day as long as you want. Your spouse, however, may want to keep getting up early to maintain some schedule. Find a way to compromise. Maybe you can sleep in three days a week, but agree to get up the other four.
Avoid codependency. If your partner did not work, that person may have a social life and schedule of his or her own. Try not to infringe on your partner's time. Allow your partner to maintain his her own schedule and understand you will not always be included in plans.

, Oftentimes, your social life is heavily connected to your work life. When you're retired, you may find yourself socializing less often. Humans need social connections at all ages. Work to maintain social connections after retirement.Make plans with friends. This can be awkward, as oftentimes work plans are spur of the moment. You may have decided to grab a drink with a co-worker after a long day. Now, you'll have to actively reach out when you want to spend time with friends. Try to talk to friends about the possibility of regularly scheduled social events, like weekly game nights.
Get on social media. While Facebook or Twitter may seem like silly ways to stay in touch, you'd be surprised how many social events are planned via a social media platform. Simply maintaining a regular Facebook profile can help you maintain social connections after retirement.
Reach out to non-work friends. During your career, you may have inadvertently limited your social contact to work friends. You may have lessened contact with friends from school or the community. Try to make plans with friends you neglected during your career.

, Retirement provides you with an invaluable opportunity to reflect on your past. Try to look back on the trajectory of your life. Reflect on past moments. An increased understanding and appreciation for the past can help you understand yourself, making the transition into retirement smoother. You will be spending a lot of time alone with your thoughts in retirement, so being okay with yourself and your choices is important.Go through old photo albums or family movies to spur memories. Pause as you browse old albums and videos, trying to put yourself back in the moment and savor the memory.
Ask yourself questions as you consider the past. Why did you make the choices you made? Are you happy with how you spent your time? If there's anything you feel you missed out on, retirement could give you an opportunity to pursue it.
Reminisce with others. Call up an old friend or family member and talk about the past. If you have family or friends in town, make plans to get coffee or drinks and talk about the past.

, A lot of people go into retirement with many plans for the future. However, this is not always realistic. Making big commitments within the first months of retirement may prove stressful. Give yourself a year to simply live without working. Take some small trips and look into engaging in some small hobbies. However, hold off on your big plans and endeavors until you've had time to get accustom to not working., An unstructured life can be stressful. Even if you have no work obligations, try to get on some kind of schedule after retirement. You will feel better physically and emotionally if your life retains some structure after retirement.Stick to commitments, even small ones. For example, make a point of taking a long walk each morning. Shower every day. Make lunch for yourself every day at noon.Consider your sleep schedule. If you're not going to bed and waking up at roughly the same time each day, it can be hard to stick to other routines. While you may like the idea of being able to sleep in, consider getting up around 9 each morning anyway. A regular sleep schedule will allow you to maintain a regular exercise, eating, and social schedule as well.

, As stated, give yourself a year or so to adjust. However, during this time you should write down some goals for yourself. Going into retirement with a plan can help prevent stagnancy.


Think about what you want to do now that you're retired. When you were working, there were likely many things you simply did not have time for. Maybe you want to volunteer with your community more. Maybe you want to spend more time with your grandkids. Maybe there's some reading you want to finally get done.
Also, consider travel plans. If you never took that trip to California, maybe you can do so now if you have the time and money.
Try to think of a realistic time table for retirement goals. You're not going to check everything off your bucket list in a year. However, maybe you can hope to have accomplished some of your post-retirement goals in 2 to 3 years., After retirement, many people pursue work. You may want to try a new career or look into part-time employment. Even when working is not financially necessary, many people derive a sense of purpose through having a job. Consider looking for work after retirement if you like the idea of having some schedule and guidance even when you're technically retired.It can be difficult to find employment, especially in a new field, after retiring. However, there may be organizations in your area dedicated to helping people starting second careers late in life. Browse the yellow pages or look online to see if there are any organizations in your community.You could also consider part-time, less demanding work. Substitute teaching, for example, has a fairly easy certification process in most states. You would not have a regular, demanding schedule, but you would have some structure in your life.
There are a lot of benefits to post-retirement work. Studies show it lessens depression associated with retirement and may stave off cognitive decay that comes with age. If you feel lost without a career as guidance, post-retirement work is worth considering., For many, retirement is a chance to get involved. Consider joining an organization or volunteering in retirement. There may be organizations in your town specifically made for the recently retired.


Consider what you always wanted to do, but never had time for when you were working. Maybe you always wanted to be on the local theater board, but simply could not fit the meetings into your schedule.
Keep your personality type in mind. You may not enjoy all activities and events catered to the recently retired. It's okay to pass on certain opportunities and social events. You should seek to find post-retirement involvement that suits your specific needs., Work takes up a lot of your time and social life. There are probably friends from outside the office you have not seen in years. Consider calling an old friend and inviting him or her out to lunch or dinner.


Relationships often fall to the wayside when you're busy with work commitments. Your college roommate, who you thought you'd be close to for life, may have disappeared from your life over time. However, strong friendships tend to rekindle easily, even if a lot of time has passed. Call up a friend you have no seen in years.
Consider visiting old friends. If you still know a lot of people in your hometown, make a trip to visit. If you've been promising your friend Matt from grad school you would come visit him Seattle one of these days, do so in retirement.

, Memoir writing can be a fun, creative way to help you adjust to retirement. It can also allow you to examine your past, enhancing your understanding of yourself and your life.


See if any local community centers or colleges offer memoir writing classes. Some universities allowed retired people to audit courses or take them for a small fee.
You can also look into online courses. A wide variety of universities offer coursework online.

, Make sure to take care of yourself in retirement. Without the schedule provided by work, basic habits like eating can fall to the wayside. As you get older, certain health problems like high blood pressure become more likely. A low-fat diet, rich in fruits and vegetables, can help stave off age-related illnesses.Talk to your doctor about your diet. If you're older, you may be at risk for age-related health conditions. Have a full physical shortly after retirement and talk to your doctor about what your diet should ideally look like.Try to eat regularly. Oftentimes, mealtimes are dictated by breaks in work. For example, you may have stopped at 2 for lunch in the office each day. Now that you are retired, make an effort to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner at roughly the same times each day.

, If you're older, you likely have medications that you need to take each day. It may be difficult to keep track of your medication regiment. If you have a lot of medication, try writing a list of which meds you need to take which days.You can also buy a pill container at the supermarket which is divided into sections marked by the days of the week. You can place the pills you need to take each week in the container. This can be a helpful tool for tracking medications.

, You should strive to stay physically active in retirement. Exercise is also often tied in with your work schedule. You may, for example, hit the gym 3 days a week after work. Now that you're retired, work on staying active. Even something small, like a short walk each day, can help prevent age-related medical problems.As you get older, certain activities may be difficult. Look for exercise groups for the elderly, like water aerobics, to keep active later in life., Retirement can be associated with an increased risk for mental health issues like depression and anxiety. If you notice a change in your mood, consider talking to a mental health professional. You can find a therapist through your insurance or ask your regular doctor for a referral. Many people struggle with mental health issues with retirement. Talking out these issues with a therapist can help.

Calculate how much you need to save for retirement.,
Set a retirement amount or goal.,
Work with a financial planner.,
Enroll in your employer’s retirement plan.",How to Retire in Your 30s1," The myth of early retirement savings is you need to save somewhere between $5 – $10 million dollars to never have to work again. But this is a general number that may not apply to your financial situation or your lifestyle. A more accurate formula is to take your annual spending and multiply it by somewhere between 20 and 50. The large range allows you determine how much you need to save, based on your particular lifestyle.


For example. If you make $30,000 per year, you might need between $600,000 and $1,500,000 in savings
The safe withdrawal rate is how much you can afford to take out from your savings and investments every year, if you no longer work. So if you multiply your annual spending by 25, you’re using a 1 – 2% safe withdrawal rate. You will have 1 – 2% of your investments to spend annually, possibly forever, once you retire.Withdrawal rate, in order to avoid invading corpus, must be less than returns plus any taxes owed.
Inflation and changes in the market are hard to predict and will affect how much your savings will be worth by the time you are in your 30s and ready to retire. But according to the Trinity Study, which looked at how much a person would need to save to weather possible inflation, market crashes, or other financial issues, the 1– 2% withdrawal rate is a safe bet for most individuals looking to retire early.;
, Using the 1 – 2% safe withdrawal rate, decide how much money you will need to save to retire successfully and comfortably. This will depend on other factors, such as how many individuals there are in your household (are you saving on your own? with a partner who also earns an income? for a family?), and your lifestyle choices. Sit down and choose a rough amount, higher than you might need, and work towards that goal.Consider lifestyle factors like how many individuals will be supported by your savings, your living situation (do you already own a home? an apartment?), and your standard of living (do you enjoy an expensive lifestyle that you don’t want to give up, or are you willing to live more frugally?)
For a family of three, with two earners in the household, your retirement goal could be $600,000, plus a fully paid off home. Using the 1 – 2% safe withdrawal, your family might then have $24,000 to live off of every year once you retire in your 30s. Remember that this depends on things like your life span and investment returns each year. , It is not necessary to hire a financial planner to help you figure out your investments, as you can look on several online sources and check out library books on managing your finances. But a financial planner can help you work toward your retirement goal and organize your investments.Ask your financial planner about your asset allocations. Asset allocations are how you distribute your savings among different types of investments, such as stock funds, bond funds, and stable value or money market investments. How you distribute your savings will also affect how much risk you are taking on your returns. For example, a portfolio that holds 80% bonds and 20% stocks will provide a return and risk pattern that will be different from a portfolio holding 15% bonds and 85% stocks.
You should be investing aggressively when you are in your 20s and 30s, especially if you are aiming to retire early. If possible, allocate up to 80 percent or even 90 percent of your assets in a diverse array of stocks and bonds.A good strategy may be to make higher-risk investments during this accumulation period, as you will in theory have a longer period from which to recover from any risky investments that didn't pay off (10 to 20 years). When you are getting ready to rely on that money and you have met your goals, you will want to convert to safer investments.

, Most employer retirement plans offer a 401(k). This means that your employer sponsors a fund where your employer matches the amount of money in this fund. For example, if you have $1,500 in your 401(k), your employer may match this amount with $1,500. There are maximum annual contribution limits for these funds and as you move up the career ladder, these maximums get larger. Put raises into your retirement savings and don’t spend them.You can also gradually increase contributions to your 401(k) over time if you can’t afford to stash all your pay in a retirement fund. You won’t miss this money if you increase your savings slowly.
To retire in your 30s, you should increase your 401(k) contributions to a higher percentage to accelerate your savings and how much your company will match. Keep in mind you will have a much shorter period of time in which to contribute to your 401(k) and that there are penalties for accessing your 401(k) early — before you are 59 1/5.

Pay off all your debts and stay out of debt.,
Generate income outside of your paycheck.,
Involve your partner in your retirement plan.,
Reduce your monthly expenses.,
Bike or walk, rather than drive.,
Avoid eating out.,
Do free leisure activities.,
Embrace a do-it-yourself lifestyle.",How to Retire in Your 30s2," If you have multiple sources of debt, try to consolidate them into one account with the lowest interest rate. Pay off as much as possible every month until the debt is paid off. Then, avoid getting back into debt through the use of credit cards or loans. Keep your credit score healthy and remain debt free.Once you are debt free, take the monthly funds you would put towards your debt and put it into your savings account.

, If it fits your lifestyle, focus on reaching your retirement goal faster by doing freelance work outside of your day job. Take odd jobs for family or friends that will add funds to your savings account. Remember that every penny you save now brings you one step closer to retirement in your 30s.Some full-time jobs do not allow for you to work at other companies. Check your contract or ask your human resources contact.
It may be more feasible for you to work hard at your current job and get raises, bonuses, or promotions instead of focusing on other jobs after hours.
Think about skills or abilities that you can channel into extra forms of income. This could be a gardening or landscaping side business, or a freelance writing business. Try to maximize your skills and add to your savings nest egg.

, If you are living with a partner or involved in a long term relationship, your significant other should be supportive of your retirement plan. Work together to achieve a mutual retirement plan and agree to lifestyle changes that will help you both achieve your retirement goals.Pooling your financial resources could also help you both reach retirement in your 30s much faster.

, If you are renting an affordable apartment or living space, focus on cutting down on other expenses like your internet costs, your cellphone, and your food costs. Reducing your expenses by $10-$20 a month can add up to more funds in your savings account, towards your retirement.Focus on stacking savings on top of one another to add up to a large amount of money saved. This means embracing a frugal lifestyle and not spending money when you do not need to. Eliminating the desire for new or expensive items, for the sake of retiring early, will make it easier to avoid spending money on these items.

Invest in stocks and bonds.,
Research ""hard assets."",
Put a portion of your earnings in an IRA.",How to Retire in Your 30s3," The usual recommendations for investing are a little different if you are planning to retire in your 30s. This is because you have a shorter period of time in which to make investments that are risky but may possibly be high-yield down the line. Stocks are riskier investments, and are better as long-term investments, since the idea is that you will be working and able to still support yourself if the stocks are not doing well for a period. Then as you get older and stop working, the recommendation is convert your investments into bonds, which are less volatile but don't have the potential to be high-yield like stocks do.If you are retiring in your 30s, you have far less time to wait for a volatile stock to even out and grow, giving you a good return on your investment. You might, then, want to make a safer investment in bonds, but these may not accumulate fast enough to allow you to retire early.
A stock represents a stake in a company. When you own a share of a stock, you are a part owner in the company and have a claim on every asset and every penny in the company’s earnings.A bond is a financial IOU from a company or the government. Companies and governments issue bonds to fund their day-to-day operations or to finance specific projects.
When you buy a bond, you are loaning your money to the issuer, whether it’s a company or a government body, for a certain period of time. In return, you get interest on the loan, and you get the entire loan amount paid back either on a specific date (the bond’s maturity date) or a future date of the issuer’s choice. For example, if a bond is valued at $1,000, and pays 7% a year, it has an interest value of $70.
You can invest in stocks and bonds by buying them individually or by buying them via a mutual fund. A mutual fund is a collection of stocks, bonds, or cash equivalents, or a mix of all three., Hard assets, like gold or house properties, are illiquid: they are literal goods you cannot break down, or liquidate, in order to sell. Because of this nature, investing in hard assets can be tricky for novices. However, real estate investments offers considerable tax advantage in the United States, often non-recourse financing for leverage, and high returns if selected carefully. Focus on smarter investments like stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents.
Consider low-risk investments, which will generate smaller but consistent returns, versus riskier investments that rely on things like supply and demand.

, An IRA is an Individual Retirement Account that acts as a savings account with big tax breaks. IRAs are not investment accounts. They are baskets where you keep stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other assets. There are several types of IRAs, including traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, and Simple IRAs.There are also Drip Account IRAs. These are popular and safe investment portfolios under IRAs that provide high money value with less commission.Talk to your bank or your financial advisor about IRAs. Each type of IRA has eligibility restrictions based on your income or employment status. All types have caps on how much you can contribute each year.
Note that there are penalties if you take out your money before the designated retirement age. If you retire at 35, you can't get qualified plan disbursements without a 10% penalty.

Speak with a financial professional before returning to work.,
Assess your Social Security standing.,
Do the math.,
Postpone your Social Security benefits.,
Acknowledge income tax considerations.",How to Decide Whether to Go Back to Work After Retirement1," In the same way that it is important to get your finances squared-away before retiring, it is also extremely important to understand how returning to work will affect your finances. In particular, returning to work will likely affect Social Security benefits, taxes, health-care coverage and pension. If you do not know how returning to work will affect these important financial considerations, speak with someone who is familiar with your financial situation and who will be able to advise you regarding the impact of returning to work., Depending on your age and your income, your Social Security benefits will likely be reduced if you return to work. That said, you can still collect benefits and work, especially if you’re only working part time.Most importantly, if you go back to work prior to full retirement age and earn a certain level of allowable income, your benefits will be reduced by $1 for every $2 you make above that level.
Your full retirement age varies based on the year you were born, but is likely 66-70. As of 2016, the allowable income you can earn while receiving full Social Security benefits is $1,310 per month, or $15,720 per year.

, For example, if you go back to work in 2016 at age 64 while receiving benefits, and make $20,720 dollars over the course of the year (without reaching your full retirement age during that year), you made $5,000 more than the allowable amount while receiving benefits. This is the amount that will be ultimately used to determine the reduction in your benefits. The more you make, the more your monthly Social Security benefits will be reduced.You’ll need to report expected monthly income while receiving benefits. It is this number that will be used to determine the monthly reduction in your Social Security payment. If your income turns out to be different than reported, you will either owe additional taxes or be given a tax rebate after filing taxes.

, Many people will benefit by postponing the point at which they begin to receive Social Security benefits. If you have retired, but have not begun receiving any Social Security benefits, consider waiting to do so until you’ve reached full retirement age (likely 66-70, depending on the year you were born). By doing so, you’ll receive delayed retirement benefits that equate to greater financial gain in the long run.If you retire, start receiving benefits, and decide to go back to work within a year, don’t worry. You can stop the benefits dispersal, pay back what you were given, and maintain the ability to receive benefits when you retire for good.

, If you’re receiving money from investments, including distributions from a retirement plan, going back to work may put you in a higher income bracket and increase the taxes you owe. The main thing to consider is whether going back to work may actually cost you. In simplest terms, remember that your Social Security benefits will likely be taxed as federal income.For instance, if you set up a 401(k) or IRA that deferred income tax until it was withdrawn from the account, the financial incentive for doing so was the assumption that you’d be in a lower income bracket after retirement. Essentially, you may wind up paying more (in taxes) to access the money in your retirement savings accounts.
Outline a basic after-tax budget. Make an estimated bottom line assessment of how going back to work will ultimately affect your annual income."
"
Take a job that offers health care benefits.,
Make sure you won’t reduce your pension.,
Plan on work-related expenses.",How to Decide Whether to Go Back to Work After Retirement2," If you have retired before being eligible for Medicare (at age 65), you may still be paying for healthcare. If you are paying for yourself and an spouse and are not covered through an employer, these costs could be substantial. Going back to work can be especially helpful in covering these costs, as you may have access to an employer based healthcare program.You may even be able to work a part-time job that qualifies you for access to your employer’s group health care plan.
You will be penalized by a excise tax every year you do not have health insurance. As of 2016, these penalties are increasing annually. Make sure you are always insured.
Even with Medicare, having additional coverage through an employer will help cover expenses that Medicare does not cover.

, If you’re receiving a pension from your career before retirement, that plan may be reduced if you go back to work and retire again down the line. This is because pension plans are often based on your salary in the years preceding your retirement.For instance, if you have been well-paid previously, but decide to go back to work on a part-time basis, for instance, this may significantly diminish what you will receive from your pension.
To avoid this from occurring, speak directly with whomever oversees pensions for your employer, and ask about how coming back to work may change your future pension.

, Though relatively minor, it’s important to factor in the costs associated with going to work. For instance, will you have transportation costs? You may also need to buy new clothes or equipment. Finally, eating lunch out or even packing a lunch can wind up being surprisingly costly.Further, are there any other people or pets that depend on your care during the day? Might you have to pay for pet boarding or a day nurse for your spouse?

Seek a fulfilling position.,
Give yourself something to do.,
Keep moving.,
Note the objective mental health advantages.",How to Decide Whether to Go Back to Work After Retirement3," Often going back to work after retiring can give you the opportunity to try something you’ve always wanted to do. Alternatively, look into ways you can “give back” to your community by taking a job as a teacher or a non-profit organization.Staying inspired and informed well into full age won’t happen on it’s own. Not only does working offer the opportunity to keep your mind and body active, it keeps you engaged with others.

, Aside from the fulfillment derived from doing something you’re interested in or that has an impact, it may also improve your quality of life to keep challenging yourself. In this sense, lean towards doing something relevant to your past experiences, so that your skills will be an asset to your role.Simply put, purpose, self-worth, and identify often come from your career. Many people are happier getting up and going to work. If you find yourself feeling restless during retirement, going back to work may be exactly what you need.

, A tangible benefit of going back to work is simply getting out the house and keeping your body active. Even if you’re getting some golf and travel in during retirement, you’re also likely finding yourself with less to do, in a literal sense.If you find yourself sitting around and becoming restless, start searching for a position that interest you.
If you’d been physically active during your career, look into jobs that will also incorporate some physicality. Once great option is working at a park.

, Aside from physical fitness and emotional contentment, going back to work may postpone some of the mental decline that comes with advanced age. For example, memory loss and the ability to process information will likely be postponed if you keep your mind active with a job. Further, the peripheral social benefits of working can also help your mind continue operating at a high capacity."
"
Treat retirement as an everyday occurrence.,
Don't feel like you're 'less' a person because you aren't working.,
Consider the bondage of employment versus the freedom of retirement.,
Avoid the trap of telling yourself you're ""too old"".,
Use and build on the knowledge you have gained while you were working.,
Sharpen your saw.,
Do community and charity work.,
Try social networking for company and for reaching out to share information.,
Get involved in something that you can make a difference in.,
Distribute happiness where ever you go.,
Keep yourself engaged.",How to Manage Retirement Disillusionment," Suppose you retire at the age of 60 years old. Look back over the previous sixty years and ask yourself if you have not already been doing some things that had an element of ""retiring"" attached to them. Don’t you retire every day, at the end of the day for sleep? Looked at in this way, you have sixty years of experience retiring in some way, every day of your life. And, when you get up each day it is a chance to celebrate a new day, a new outlook on life, and to find renewed energy to make a difference in the world. There is always opportunity for change and redirection. Similarly, your retirement from a job is not an end but a transition; it is a transition from one phase of your life to a new and, with your agreement and effort, a better phase for you, both intellectually and spiritually. As such, it is a definite cause for celebration.;
, Retirement does not make you a lesser person: You remain a highly skill- and talent-endowed person with skill sets that have grown over the many years and that have provided you with many achievements throughout the tenure of your employment or business life. When you retire, you still have those skill sets. You can now use them whenever you want, at the time you want, and in the place you want. From an employee, your status can suddenly transform to that of being an entrepreneur. That means that your skills and professional abilities are as valuable as when you were in employment, and you are your own boss and decision maker, not a follower. That's a huge positive!

, While for some people the security of daily employment brought not only regular financial reward but also routine, regularity and patterns, this comes at a price of being obliged to follow the rules and expectations your employer created. In addition, for many employees, it is a cause for complaint, feeling constrained but the trade-off of security, and familiarity usually wins out. For those of you for whom there were many things you wanted to do during your employment, but couldn't due to the compulsions of your employment and time constraints, retirement offers a breath of fresh air filled with opportunity. Now you can fulfill those wishes, dreams, and goals without the previous time and rule constraints of your job.

, In a world where the older population is growing increasingly large, greater acceptance of retirees taking on renewed roles in society now exists, and there is great freedom to undertake new business and work as a retiree. Telling yourself that you're too old, too poor, too worn out, etc., tends to be self-fulfilling and will trap you into giving up. Instead of giving into despair, go to the library and borrow books by people who started again upon retirement and have achieved great things. You will be inspired.

, You have a wide source of knowledge gained from your education and professional experience. Be prepared to pass on this knowledge to those who need it; there are always plenty of inexperienced people seeking to learn more from those who have great skills and knowledge. Let your knowledge reach the needy and guide the younger generation through mentoring, teaching, and sharing skills whether it's through your own business, night classes, workshops, or online volunteering. This will not only give you satisfaction, but you will also stay up-to-date with your skills because you will need to ensure you're passing on the latest knowledge.

, Now you have the time and accumulated resources from years of expertise, use your resources intelligently and diligently to push yourself into new learning and beyond your current comfort zone. Lifelong learning doesn't stop with retirement. Study more deeply in your area of expertise and keep learning from others, from young to old. Steven Covey mentions ""sharpening the saw"" in The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, and uses it to refer to balancing your life to ensure that what you're doing is sustainable long-term, and renews your effectiveness.In doing this, you will become more mentally, spiritually, and psychologically attuned and will feel a greater sense of fulfillment during your retirement.


Never put down your skills as being old-school or outdated. The responsibility always rests with us to remain up-to-date when we leave educational institutions and workplaces, and with the internet, online libraries, and many free educational resources, there is no excuse for not keeping informed.

, You can help the needy in your community by associating with civil society groups, educational groups, or even forming your own small group to teach and empower the less privileged in society. You can also work to spread awareness about pressing issues such as public health (prevention and treatment of AIDS, tuberculosis, bird flu, etc.), ways to prevent pollution, and helping people with mental health issues such as depression, low self-esteem, etc.


Consider working with wikis in the online environment as a way to share skills, teach, and reach out to people in an educational context. This allows you to be mobile (a laptop or iPad can go anywhere you can), and providing a great place to record your knowledge and expertise for future generations to learn from.

, During your employment, you may never have had the inclination or time to be a part of social networking. Now you have all the time in the world and good reason to inject your wisdom into the social network streams. Join social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, and others. Many influential people from politics, films, sports, media and other fields are actively involved in the social networking and what's more, you do not need to be famous to become influential; rather, you need to make it clear that you know what you're talking about and people will soon listen and follow you.


Exchange notes with people in your fields of interest and develop new working relationships. You can keep abreast with all the latest happenings in all the fields including technical. You can even write articles in blogs in the areas of your expertise.

, There are plenty of pastimes, hobbies, and activities where you can continue to make astonishing contributions to the world. Think of amateur astronomers who have the time to make discoveries as amazing as those of the professional astronomers. Think about teachers who never stop teaching, healers who never stop healing, and writers who never stop writing. There is always something to contribute, especially where it concerns teaching the young and the willing.

, Consider the ways in which you can be an uplifting presence in people's lives. Telling people how much they matter, helping them to see their strengths and abilities, and guiding them with a smile, are just some ways you can be a source of inspiration and happiness in the lives of others.


If you are a person of faith and someone with deep empathy and compassion, you can counsel people in grief or who are going through rough transitions in life, such as by praying for them or simply listening to them in times of trouble. Your presence and kind talk will bring some relief for them.

, Stay active for giving in to passivity and doing nothing will bring despair, helplessness, and futility into your life faster than you can blink. Engage yourself in the above activities or at least some, and rest assured, you will be very busy and hardly have any time to feel distraught or dejected. Keeping yourself engaged will also keep you mentally and physically healthy.

Think about how important flowers are to you, and decide how much you are willing to spend on the whole wedding and also specifically on flowers alone. The average person spends about 8% of the wedding budget on flowers.


For example, if your wedding budget is $20,000, you might consider allocating $1,600 for flowers.
Your budget will have a major impact on what kinds of flowers you order, how many you order, and how much you spend on a florist.;
, You can’t really decide on what kinds of flowers you want until you’ve chosen a color scheme and/or theme for your wedding. If you want a rustic chic wedding with white and pale pink, you’re going to have completely different flowers than you would if you had a black tie evening wedding. Your flowers don’t necessarily have to match your wedding colors, but they should at least compliment them.If you go with a rustic chic theme, consider using a lot of baby’s breath and pink roses.
If your wedding is more of a formal evening event, consider going more classic with all white flowers.

, The venue plays a big role in your floral choices. Make sure to find a venue and lock it down before getting too carried away with your floral ideas. Consider the colors, style, and furniture in your venue when brainstorming floral ideas.

If you had modern lavender and blush floral arrangements in mind initially but then ended up securing a vintage ballroom as your venue, your space wouldn’t match your floral decor., Many of the more talented and popular wedding florists are booked up to a year in advance. Make sure you start your brainstorming, planning, and searching process early on so that you’ll have multiple florists to choose from.Take recommendations from others. Ask your family members, friends, and venue if they know of any exceptional florists., Once you’re certain of your wedding date, it’s a good idea to do some research on the best flowers and plants to use for your wedding during that particular season. Getting the appropriate flowers and greenery for the season will save you money and allow your arrangements to look more natural and alive on your wedding day.

Spring: lilacs, freesia, roses, tulips
Summer: roses, hydrangeas
Fall: roses, mums, sunflowers
Winter: roses, lilies, winterberries, holly, There are many different styles of floral arrangements that you can choose from. All other wedding details, including the season, venue, theme, color scheme, etc. will influence your style. Consider different styles and make some decisions about which ones will look best with the rest of your wedding details.

Classic: round, crisp designs often including roses
Romantic: Looser, fluffier flowers with neutrals and pinks
Natural: inspired by nature, looser, greenery-heavy organic designs
Bold: bright colors
Modern: minimal design with clean lines and modern shapes
Wild: free-flowing, wide variety of color and texture, With all of this in mind, check out wedding websites such as Wedding Wire and The Knot to look for a wide variety of florists who specialize in weddings. Read reviews, check out photos of their work to assess quality and style versatility, check their rates, and make sure they’re located near your venue. Make a list of your favorites., The work that wedding florists do tends to vary so much and involve so much customization that many don’t have flat rates. Either call or email all the florists on your list to tell them very briefly what you’re looking for and ask for a rough price estimate., Cross off any florists on your list whose quotes are higher than your budget and then schedule face-to-face interviews with the remaining florists. Try to schedule at least 2 or 3 so that you have multiple options to choose from., Gather fabric swatches, magazine clippings, saved Pinterest photos, etc. and take them to the meetings so that you can best explain your vision to each florist. This will help them develop a clear idea about what you want and whether or not they can execute it.

, In addition to explaining your vision to each florist, you’ll need to ask them some questions. Put together a list of important questions to ask each florist and then ask the questions and write down the answers when you meet with them. Some questions that you should consider asking include:


How many weddings have you done?
Can you work with my budget?
Do you have my wedding date open?
Based on my theme, venue, and color scheme, what kinds of flowers do you recommend?
What kinds of wraps can you do for my bouquet?
Can you provide any organic, pesticide free flowers to put on my wedding cake?
Do you charge a delivery fee?
What’s your refund policy in case I have to cancel my order?, After all of your meetings/interviews, compare all of the notes that you have on each florist and choose the one that you feel like you trust, who seems to be giving you the best deal financially, and who stood out overall.


Once you inform your chosen florist that you’d like to commit to them, they will most likely send you a proposal and contract that breaks down all of the pricing and clearly explains their duties as your florist.

You may have also thought of a nice college town or even just staying where you are to enjoy grandchildren. Consider a variety of options for where you want to retire from dream locations to maintaining your current situation.Compose a list of places you’re considering retiring. Make a tiered list that includes dream locations, easily attainable or alternative “dream” places, and staying in your current or a similar area. For example, “Dream locations: Paris, Bora Bora, Santa Barbara. Alternative and less expensive dream places: Berlin, Thailand, San Diego. Less desirable: staying here at a retirement community, moving to Florida near grandkids, spending part of the year here and part in San Diego.”;
, As you get older, safety concerns can become a higher priority. Look at things such as crime statistics, economic data, and the political situation for any area you might want to retire. This can help you determine if your chosen locations will be an enjoyable and safe environment.Contact local authorities to get more specific information. If you are considering an international locale, your country’s local embassy or consulate can give you information on safety concerns, including political stability.

, No matter how healthy and active you are when you retire, you may encounter unexpected medical conditions. You may even need maintenance medicine for seasonal allergies. Having medical facilities close to you can ensure that you get prompt care or treatment for any conditions that may come your way.Check out not only local doctors and hospitals, but also things such as retirement homes and senior services. This can prevent you from having to make another big move from your chosen destination to get medical care.

, Many seniors consider moving to different areas and countries to save money. Thinking about the various financial aspects of each area, such as taxes and cost of living, can also help you to decide which places may be right for your retirement.Take cost of living into consideration. Your decisions about factors such as whether to rent or buy, own a car or take public transportation, and the locality’s average cost of living can help you decide if your choice is right for you.
Recognize that taxes can vary significantly from place to place. In addition, if you decide to leave your home country for another, you will have to continue paying taxes where you are a citizen. You may also need to pay taxes in the new country.

, From climate and weather to people and cultural amenities, the environment in which you live can have a considerable impact on your lifestyle. Getting a sense of the environment at the place you’re considering retiring can help you decide if it’s right for you.Think about the climate and whether at your potential retirement locations. For example, wintry conditions may present a great challenge to you as you age.
Consider the other type of climate: the cultural one. Are you looking for an area with a great deal of diversity and cultural amenities such as the performing arts? Are you willing to embrace new cultures?

, The goal of retirement is to fill your days with things you want to do. These take the place of your work. Maybe you want to move to a warmer climate, travel, or enjoy time with family. Thinking about what type of lifestyle you want to have can help you better decide if the time is right for you to retire.Plot what you want to do on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. This can help you get an overall picture of your wishes as well as how much money you may need to retire the way you want. If it feels like a bit too much to make this kind of plan, you may not be ready to retire.Think about if you want to live a bit more frugally or maybe use your time to explore the world around you or even new hobbies. Factors such as your where you want to live—in your current locality or home—can also impact your overall lifestyle.

But over the course of their careers, many retirees have a large circle of close family and friends. How close you want to be to these people can influence your decision of where to retire.Think about your ability to make new friends and maintain currents ones if you move to a new location.
Consider how close you want to be to your children, grandchildren or other family members. For example, moving to a peaceful and remote farm or another country may make it more difficult to see you loved ones often.

, Many people consider retiring at a specific age, such as on their 65th birthday. When you retire, your bank account becomes your employer. What you’ve saved and invested is your bi-weekly or monthly paycheck.

You can also make cuts to your anticipated retirement budget.

, In general, people also fund their retirements with investments in the stock markets. Deciding to retire in a bad, or bear, market can affect how much money you have at and during retirement. Taking stock of your personal investments and the market in general can help you figure out if it’s time to retire or stay in the game until the market is stronger, also known as a bull market.Consider retiring and beginning to take withdrawals from your investments if you are on the cusp of a bull market. This means that your portfolio can likely get through future market downturns.
Try working a bit longer if your investment portfolio has had significant losses in the years before your retirement or if it is a bear market. Early losses in a bear market could increase your risk of running out of money.
Manage your investment risks more closely as you get closer to retirement. Investing in less risky portfolio can ensure that you get enough in returns to fund the retirement you want., Many retirees use social welfare programs as a primary source of income. Your benefits will vary depending on where you live, but in the US, for example, the maximum amount at full retirement age is $2,639/month. Knowing what your benefits are can help you figure out if you’re ready to retire or should work a bit longer to gain full retirement benefits.Make sure to calculate your social security benefits with your investments and savings to get a complete picture of how much money you will have every month.
Wait until at least full retirement age to get your benefits. This is usually between the ages of 66 and 70. If you can hang on a bit longer, this may also benefit you.For example, collecting social security benefits in the US at age 70 instead of 67 will give you almost $1000 more every month than if you retired at 66.Recognize that retiring before full retirement age can reduce your benefits by almost 30 percent., Retiring doesn’t mean your expenses go away. You’ll also need to figure out how much you’ll need to cover things such as living and healthcare expenses every month. Having an idea of what your expenses are versus your income sources can help you decide if the time is right to retire.Put together an overall picture of your monthly expenses. If your retirement income sources can easily cover this with some funds remaining, you can probably retire with confidence.
Consider new expenses such as nursing homes or assisted living facilities, taxes, or inheritances for your children. Using an online retirement worksheet can help you figure out what your monthly expenses may be.Recognize that you may also have unexpected expenses, such as healthcare or other emergencies, that you want to have enough income to cover.

, You’ll also need to continue paying down any debt you have after you retire. Deciding to retire when you still have considerable debt could leave you with less money to pay for other expenses or things you want to do.Pay off as much high-interest debt, such as credit cards, as quickly as you can. Paying off your monthly mortgage can also eliminate a considerable expense and ensure you have more money to retire., Deciding to retire is not a simple process. It can be even harder if you don’t have a good idea of what you need or already have. Meeting with a financial advisor or planner can help you make more informed decisions about factors such as when to retire, how to get the most money during retirement, and dealing with emergencies.Choose a financial planner who specializes in retirement. Ask your bank, a friend, or family member if they have any recommendations. Organizations such as the National Associations of Personal Financial Advisors offer free online location services.A financial planner will have the best idea of what a person typically needs to retire. They can also help you make the decision if and where you should retire.
Provide the financial planner all of the relevant information on things such as your sources of income, debt, taxes, as well as how you wish to retire.

Think about formality.,
Keep the theme in mind.,
Think about the time of day.,
Select the right attire for destination weddings.",How to Choose a Dress for the Mother of the Bride1," How formal is the wedding? This will affect the kind of dress it's appropriate to wear. A very formal wedding will require a dress to match, while you can go for something more casual for a low-key wedding.A full-length is required for a very formal wedding. Your dress should minimize sparkle. Stick to a conservative gown in only one or two colors.
A very casual wedding, like a beach wedding, does not call for a very fancy dress. A sundress may be sufficient, although a light shawl or cardigan may be necessary in case it gets chilly. Make sure to consult with the bride so your dress is not more formal than her dress.
For semi-formal weddings, choose a dress that matches the attire of the bride and bridesmaids. Something like a halter dress with a jacket can easily fit in at a semi-formal affair.;
, If a wedding has a strict theme, it's important your dress matches that theme. Make sure you know the theme of the wedding, and the kind of attire that's appropriate, before selecting a dress.For example, a wedding with a renaissance theme may require a dress with an archaic feel.
Religious and other customs may also affect the type of dress you should wear. A wedding following a specific religious tradition, for example, may require a special type of dress.

, When the wedding takes place can also affect the appropriate type of dress. Day and morning weddings generally require shorter, slightly more casual dresses. Weddings that take place closer to the evening often require evening dresses., A destination wedding may come with special considerations in regards to style. A wedding at a castle, for example, may require a long ball gown. A wedding at a beach may require a light, sunny dress."

Add some variation with color.,
Choose the right pattern.,
Talk about style choices with other mothers.,
Figure out the right length.",How to Choose a Dress for the Mother of the Bride2," You should not choose a dress that is the same color, or a very similar color, to the bridesmaids dresses. You want some variation so you will stand apart slightly from the crowd. However, you do not want to draw attention away from the bride. Pick something that fits with the color scheme, but is not too similar to the bridesmaids dresses.For example, if bridesmaids are dressed in a deep purple shade, a lavender dress can be an appropriate option.
If there is another mother of the bride, you may want to consult with her as well.

, A solid colored dress can be appropriate, but you can also opt for patterns. This can be something to set you apart from the wedding party. If bridesmaids dresses are a single color, for example, you can wear a striped or polka dot dress.Make sure to take color into consideration as well when choosing a pattern. Choose colors that match with the wedding party's color scheme.

, The mother of the groom, or the mother of the other bride, will likely be choosing a dress as well. It's a good idea to coordinate outfits. You do not have to wear the same attire, but you may want their dresses to have a few things in common. For example, you could agree to wear dresses with a similar cut, pattern, or style., Length depends heavily on the wedding's general atmosphere and theme. Usually, longer dresses and skirts work best for weddings after noon. For morning weddings, select something shorter.However, keep in mind there are no hard and fast rules. You want something that makes you feel comfortable and matches the wedding's atmosphere. For example, do not feel you have to select a longer dress for a very casual wedding that happens to take place later in the day.

Communicate while choosing a dress.,
Purchase a dress at a specialty outlet.",How to Choose a Dress for the Mother of the Bride3," As soon as possible, start shopping for your dress. This way, you can take as much time as you need to pick something that works for you. However, let the bridesmaids pick out their dresses first so you can coordinate yours. The mother of the groom, if there is one, should pick out her dress after yours. You want to make sure your dress fits in with the rest of the wedding party. Aim to have a dress settled on about a month before the wedding., Make sure to keep communication open with your daughter. As you select your dress, talk to your daughter about the wedding's general style. This way, you can make sure the dress matches somewhat with the ceremony., Go to an outlet that sells wedding attire to buy a dress, if possible.

Measure the seam.,

Make the loops.,
Bustle the dress.",How to Bustle a Gown2," To add a French bustle, start by measuring the center back seam of the gown’s train from the waist to the floor. Then measure the distance from the edge of the train to the base of the dress.Mark the place between these two distances with a pin.

, Lift the center back seam where you made the pin mark and position it against the center of the waistline, at the base of the bodice. Adjust the fold so the train is between ½” to ¾” (1.3 – 2 cm) off the floor.Pin the train to the waistline seam.
Lift the sides of the train off the floor ½” to ¾” (1.3 – 2 cm) and fold and pin the train along each side of the back seam.
To lift the remaining train off the floor, continue to fold and pin the train as necessary between the seams.

, Undo all the pin-marking points you have made on the train and waistline of the dress. Sew a length of narrow grosgrain ribbon measuring 15” (38 cm) to the waistline of the dress, using the pin marks as a guide.The ribbon should fall between the lining of the skirt and the dress’s train.
Make sure to sew the ribbon securely into the waistline seam.

, Cut 2 1/2“ (6.5 cm) of the ribbon before folding it in half and stitching the ribbon loop to the underside of the dress’s train. Make the loop stronger by reinforcing it with a small piece of interfacing, or by attaching the loop to the seam allowances of the dress.Loops should be attached ½” (1.3 cm) below each pin mark.
Repeat the same process for all other loops.

, Attach each ribbon to the corresponding loop by inserting the ribbon into the loop and tying a double bow. Plump up the fabric to make the bustle look bigger and to provide more volume.The French bustle is great for dresses with lots of train decoration centered below the waist because the bustle won’t hide the designs.The French bustle is also ideal for dresses with long trains or that are made of heavier fabrics.

Bustle the dress.",How to Bustle a Gown3," To add an overbustle, start by measuring the back seam of the dress’s train from the waistline seam to the floor and again from the edge of the train to the base of the dress.Mark the place between these two distances with a pin.

, Lift the center back seam where you made the pin mark and position it so it is flush against the center of the waistline, at the base of the bodice. Adjust the positioning so the train is ½” – ¾” (1.3 – 2 cm) off the floor.Attach the train to the seam using a pin.

, Lift the dress’s train off the floor, and pin it so the sides of the train are positioned ½” to ¾” (1.3 – 2 cm) off the floor and secured to the sides of the dress’s back seam.Fold and pin the train to lift any remaining train off the floor.
If the train is too long or heavy, redistribute the already existing folds into two smaller folds.
When the folds are securely pinned, release the bustle and remove the pins.

, In order to secure the dress on the day of the wedding, the bustle will need to be connected to the dress using either buttons or hooks. Sew these on wherever you made pin marks along the waistline.Make sure to stitch securely – you don’t want the bustle coming undone.
If the buttons or hooks need additional reinforcement, attach a small piece of interfacing under each one.

, Use strong thread to thread the needle, then knot the ends of the thread together. Place a small piece of interfacing on the topside of the dress’s train, wherever you made a pin marking denoting a button loop.Insert the needle at the pin, next to the seam-line, then pull it through the interfacing and train.
Make a small backstitch from the right side of the train. Pull the thread to make a loop reaching 1” – 2” (2.5 – 5 cm).
Place your fingers inside the loop and grasp the loop.
Pull the thread to tighten the first loop and create a second loop. Repeat this until you have a thread loop that’s big enough to fit the button or hook.
Use several back stitches to secure the thread to the underside of the dress.

, Once the loops have been added to the dress, bustle the train by fastening the loops to the buttons or hooks. Adjust the folds of fabric on the train to create a fuller and more voluminous bustle.If you don’t like the look of the exposed buttons or hooks, you can hand-sew lace appliqués on top of the buttons or hooks to conceal them.
Be sure to stock up on safety pins. American bustles are not as strong as French bustles and there's a chance that the bustle may break over the course of the evening.

Set your budget.,
Decide on your sleeves.,
Think about texture.,
Select a modest fit.",How to Choose a Modest Wedding Dress1," Before buying any wedding dress, it's important to determine your budget. You should figure out the total cost of everything involved in the wedding and figure out how much you can set aside for a dress. If your parents or spouse's parents are paying for the wedding, discuss a reasonable budget with them.Keep in mind you can always rent a dress if purchasing one is out of your budget.;
, In general, most modest wedding dresses include some kind of sleeves. There are many different sleeve options for a wedding dress, so think about what kind of sleeves you want.If you want less in terms of sleeves, go for cap sleeves. These sleeves cover your shoulders but not your underarms.
If you want more than cap sleeves but not full sleeves, a short sleeved dress can be great. It can also give your outfit a light romantic vibe. Short sleeved is considered any sleeve that's cut above the elbows.
If you want a very long sleeve, go for an elbow length sleeve or a full sleeve.

, Modest wedding dresses come in a variety of textures. Select a texture that meets your needs as a bride.Lace is the most common texture for a wedding dress. It matches well with cap sleeves and can give your dress a vintage look.
If you're looking for a dress that flows slightly, go for chiffon. It is also lightweight, which can help with comfort on your wedding day.
If you want a bouncy or puffy wedding dress, tulle works well.
Silk is a popular cut, but it is generally used for dresses that that are more fitted. If you want a modest wedding dress, you may not want a cut that's clingy.

, If you want a modest dress, you probably don't want something that's low cut, short, or very fitted. There are many options for a great cut for a modest wedding dress.Go for a longer dress. Something that's at least below your knees is great for a modest wedding dress.
A ball gown gives a fairy tale vibe to your wedding and is generally not too revealing. If you want something that highlights your figure more, without being overly revealing, try a mermaid cut.
If a mermaid dress feels too revealing, a fit and flare dress can be a great in between. It shows off some of your figure without being as clingy as a mermaid cut.

Start your search early.,
Try your luck shopping locally.,
Seek online sellers.,
Look into religious stores.,
Try having a less modest gown altered.",How to Choose a Modest Wedding Dress2," For any wedding dress, it's good to start your search early. It can be difficult to find the exact type of dress that fits your vision for your wedding and almost all types of dresses require some alterations. Tailoring usually takes six to eight months, so begin your search about a year before your wedding date., If you're lucky, you can find a dress locally. This way, you can get advice from store workers and try your dress on before purchasing it to make sure it fits.Make appointments with a variety of local providers in your area. Take an afternoon to visit a variety of shops to explore dress options.
Keep in mind it is sometimes hard to find modest cuts from local sellers.

, It can be difficult to find a modest dress locally, so do not disregard online retailers. There are many stores online that have a section specifically for modest dresses. You may also be able to find a dress at an online store that specifically sells modest dresses.You will have to send in your measurements to make sure your chosen dress fits. Take your measurements yourself or have someone else take them for you.
Almost all wedding dresses need alterations. Even if you send in your correct measurements, you will probably have to get the dress altered. Remember to shop early.

, If there are stores in your area that sell dresses for religious weddings, this may be a good place to find a more modest dress. Certain religions, like Mormonism, have specific requirements for wedding dresses in terms of modesty. Even if you are not religious yourself, it may be worth it to stop by a dress store affiliated with a particular church. You may be able to find a more modest wedding dress this way., If you can't find a modest wedding dress that suits your needs, you can always alter a less modest one. If you, for example, find a dress with the right sleeves and the right style but feel it's too low cut, you can pay to have it altered. Do not stress too much about finding the perfect dress."

Think about comfort in addition to appearance.,
Take any religious customs into account.,
Buy a dress that fits now.",How to Choose a Modest Wedding Dress3," You want a dress that's comfortable. In addition to appearance, try on a variety of dresses and find one that feels right. Nothing can sour a wedding day more than a dress that's too tight, itchy, or warm., If you're seeking a modest dress for religious reasons, make sure you know any specific rules of your religion. For example, some sects of Mormonism require your collarbone be covered in the temple. Before selecting your dress, make sure you know all religious customs., You may be planning to lose a few pounds before your wedding day. This is a worthwhile goal, but you may not reach your precise goal in time for your wedding. It's much easier to have a dress that's too big altered than try to squeeze into a dress that's too small on your wedding day."

Take what you need with you.,
Look at choices for length, sleeve style, necklines, waistlines, trains, etc.There are a ton of options out there!,
Beware of salespeople.,
Don't be discouraged.,
Shop around.,
Have fun!",How to Shop for a Wedding Dress," There's no time too early to start looking, but there is a time that's too late. Depending on where you get your dress, it could take several months for your dress to be ordered and shipped. From then, you'll need several weeks for your seamstress to make alterations. You should start shopping about 9 months before your wedding, but preferably sooner. There's nothing wrong with beginning early, even a year before you'll actually place an order. But don't make the mistake of buying yet. The last thing you want is to buy what you think is your dream dress two summers before your wedding, and find out the following summer that your real dream dress has just been created.;
, This will probably be a decision based on your budget. Decide whether you'll shop at chains, small boutiques, etc. Decide how far you'll travel to see dresses in person. If you want an expensive designer dress, you may have to travel to New York City to actually try it on. However, if you've chosen to include places like David's Bridal, you're sure to find one nearby. In bigger cities you'll have access to a number of shops and boutiques, which will carry gowns from a number of designers, but they'll probably be more on the expensive side.


Be careful when shopping online. Getting the dress sized correctly is very important, and this is best done by actually trying it on. If you're not careful you could seriously regret your decision and spend double the money if you don't like the dress you bought online and have to buy a new one. If you decide to shop online, do so with great care.
Many places don't require an appointment, but you should make one anyway. This is to ensure you don't wait around for an hour while the consultant helps customers who did have appointments. People with appointments will always come first.
Some people claim to have had bad experiences with chain stores, such as encountering sales consultants who are unfriendly or not helpful. It's hit or miss. The good news is, those stores will always have another location somewhere nearby, and you can always go to the other one. If you get a consultant who isn't nice to you and you don't want to check out the other location, just ask for a different consultant. If you're too embarrassed to do so, just leave and report her to the manager anonymously. No sales consultant has the right to be unkind to a bride!
Some shops will not let you browse freely through the gowns. They'll ask you for a description of what you're looking for and then bring you gowns they think match it. If you really hate the idea of not being able to see everything yourself, avoid these places. Call and ask first if it's important to you.
Large warehouse type stores are excellent places to find gowns. They have dresses for every budget, and will usually let you browse through the gowns as long as you want and try on as many as you want.
Look for a company that specializes in rental dresses. This can be a great solution for the bride on a budget. Men rent tuxedos - why not rent the dress too?

,


Make sure another person goes along with you. You'll definitely want an opinion aside from the consultant's. However, don't make the mistake of taking your mother, your maid of honor, your bridesmaid, your other bridesmaid, and your other bridesmaid's little sister. Not only will they get in the way, but none of them will all agree on anything, and mostly likely, at least one of them won't like whatever dress you're trying on. It's probably best to take one person (or maybe two, like your mother and maid of honor), whose opinion you trust and value.
If you're allowed, take a camera (preferably digital) with you to take snapshots of the dresses you love the most so you can keep a record of them. You'll probably try on many dresses during your search, and you'll probably quickly forget the details of each dress as you try on the next one you love. Having photos helps you remember and compare them later so you can narrow down your choice. If you can't take photos, keep a list of the designer and dress number or name so you can look them up online and save the photos that way.
Take along a bottle of water or something else hydrating. Trying on dresses can turn into a time-consuming experience, and it can also be a workout, so make sure you bring a beverage. Just be sure to keep it away from the dresses.
Photos of dresses you found online or in magazines, if you have any. Even if they're dresses made by another designer, the shop you're in may be able to help you look for something similar. A lot of chains have styles that bear a resemblance to dresses by an expensive designer as a cheaper alternative for brides with smaller budgets.
If you've already decided to wear a certain item (such as a specific pair of shoes, veil, or jewelry) because it has sentimental value, take the item along with you. If it's absolutely necessary that you wear it on your wedding day, you'll want to make sure the dress you choose goes well with it (though this may narrow your options considerably).

, Do a little research on what's possible for certain fabrics and silhouettes, but don't rule out gowns of a specific type because they don't have all the little details you prefer. If you see what looks like the dress of your dreams but it has sleeves and you wanted a sleeveless, or if your dream gown ends up having a huge train and you wanted a shorter one, you can ask a seamstress to alter these things. However, remember that seamstresses often charge a whole lot for little things, so if you want to change many things about your gown, you may be better off continue your search. Also keep in mind that most of the time, the same dress can be ordered in various colors. When you start to shop or search for gowns online, don't pass up a dress just because it's stark white and you want champagne. If you love it, check to see if it's available in champagne.

, Don't let the sales consultant talk you into anything. Remember that many consultants work for commission. Sadly, many sales consultants won't care if you really do look beautiful -- they'll want you to purchase the most expensive dress, regardless of how it looks on you. Some of them will have a genuine interest in helping you find the dress of your dreams. But don't take a chance, and stick to your own opinion and that of the people you take with you.

, Most women will try on many, many gowns during their search. It's not only normal to not find the perfect gown on your first try, it could be a warning sign that you're making a rash decision you'll regret later. Some women get lucky and do find their dream dress shortly after they start looking, but it's most likely something they realized later, after looking through many other dresses that didn't compare to the one they found in the beginning. No matter what, the savvy shopper will keep looking and then go back to that dress later if it really turns out to be The One. Expect to try on anywhere between 30 and 150 dresses before finding the final one. Some women try on hundreds. Don't feel bad if you shop for months and try on 600 dresses before you find the one that seems to be made for you.

, Once you've found the dress you want to wear on your special day, consider shopping around for various prices before you make your final purchase. One shop may have the dress you want on sale for considerably less than another. You may be able to find your dress online (but remember to always be sure you actually see and try on the dress in person before you ever purchase online). If you don't mind wearing a gown that's already been worn by another bride, you can save a great deal of money. You'll just have to consider that it's already been altered to fit the other bride, so make sure you get a very detailed description of what's been done to the dress.

, This is a time in your life when you get to try on as many exquisite and expensive dresses as you want. You'll be the center of attention (at least among your group at the shop) and people will treat you with special kindness because you're a beautiful bride. Have fun!

If the venue has strong and bold colors, you may want to select a complementary color scheme.For example, a venue with deep red carpeting and gold finishes may clash with a mint green and grey color scheme. Instead, you could use red and gold in your color scheme to match the venue.
If you already have your heart set on a certain color, you may need to select a neutrally decorated site, such as a hall with white or neutral walls, a converted loft space, or a backyard tent.;
, A great way to choose your wedding colors is to take inspiration from the season you are getting married. For example, if you’re saying “I do” in the spring, you could look to light pastel colors for inspiration. Seasonal colors combinations to consider include:Dark and deep color tones, or metallic colors like pewter, bronze, copper, silver, or gold for a winter wedding.
Light pastels paired with a few deeper shades, like plum or coral for a spring wedding.
Bright colors like bold yellows, purples, reds, or blues for a summer wedding.
Earth tones like moss green, burgundy, gold, amber, and maroon are excellent for a fall wedding.

, If you have decided on a destination wedding, you could pick colors that reflect the tropical environment. Consider bright floral colors like yellow, pink, purple, blue, and green. Alternatively, if you are getting married at a vineyard, greens, purples, and blues would look beautiful.Consider the natural color hues found within the surrounding environment and use them in your wedding color scheme.

, Although you can get most flowers during every season, it is more eco-friendly and less costly to select seasonal flowers for your wedding. Get color inspiration from your favorite seasonal flowers. Choose a flower and color that you love and then build your color scheme around that.For example, if sunflowers are your thing, there’s no reason why they shouldn’t make it into your décor scheme.
The color of your bouquet could be used as the dominant color in your decorating scheme or as an accent color to give a bit of pop.

, The colors you choose can also help to create a certain mood. For example, red is associated with passion and romance, whereas yellow is frequently associated with joy and happiness. Pick colors based on the tone you would like to set for the event.Use dark colors to create a dramatic atmosphere.
Alternatively, light colors can be used to create a fun and carefree wedding.

Research different color trends.,
Choose colors that complement each other.,
Incorporate color with care.",How to Choose Your Wedding Colors3," Read wedding magazines or visiting an art gallery to discover different color combinations. Although you don’t want to select a certain color scheme just because it is trendy, this may be a great place to find out which colors work well together., Most weddings use more than one color in the color scheme. For example, you may decide on two main colors and one accent color. It may be easy to list your three favorite colors, but what if they don’t match or work well together? You can consult a color wheel to help you pair your favorite color with a few accent colors.As a general rule, colors that go well together are opposite each other on a color wheel because this pairs a warm color with a cool color. For example, turquoise and coral pair nicely together.
The easiest way to think about color pairings is by selecting a bright color and a more neutral tone. For instance, blush and gold, or violet and grey.

, It is possible to go overboard with your colors. Perhaps your favorite color is bright pink, but you don’t want your wedding to look like a Barbie party. To avoid this, use the pink sparingly as a splash of color. Keep the rest of your colors neutral and then add a pop of pink in your bouquet, as ribbons around your centerpieces, or as the calligraphy on the menus."

Set a budget.,
Choose the same gift for everyone.,
Pick something different for everyone if you prefer.,
Think of their hobbies.,
Get them something useful for the day of the wedding.,
Give something to the ring bearer and flower girl.,
Give cash gifts or gift certificates.,
Figure out when you will give the gifts.",How to Choose Gifts for Your Wedding Party," Even if you are only planning to spend $20 on each wedding party member, that can still add up. It's easy to go overboard when you are buying gifts for people you love, but you don't want to overspend on wedding party gifts when you are also most likely still paying for your wedding and reception.;
, The easiest way to spend the same amount on every member of your wedding party is to buy them all the same gifts. For example, buy your groomsmen engraved flasks or your bridesmaids a set of jewelry to wear on the wedding day.

, It may be difficult to find something that every member of the wedding party will like; in that case, it might be easier to pick out different gifts for each person. Make sure you keep track of how much you're spending on each person so you spend roughly the same amount on each of the gifts.

, If one of your bridesmaids is interested in wine, sign her up for a wine of the month club. If one of your groomsmen likes to hike, then buy him a book about hiking. Buying different gifts for each member of the wedding party shows that you put a lot of thought into each of the gifts.

,


Consider buying your groomsmen the ties they will need to wear on the day of the wedding. This will save them money, and it's a gift they can wear again.
Give your bridesmaids a bag full of things they might need on the wedding day, like tissues, flip flops, a stain stick, and gum.

, Most likely, your ring bearer and flower girl are very young, so get them something age-appropriate. You can even buy them the outfits you want them to wear on the wedding day.

, This option works well for giving a gift to the wedding officiant and the people you choose to read during the ceremony. Gift certificates are also a good fall-back gift if you simply cannot decide what to get someone in your wedding party.

,


If your gifts are alcohol-related, the perfect time to give them might be at the bachelor and bachelorette parties.
Give the gifts at the rehearsal dinner if you buy your wedding party items they will need on the day of the wedding.
If you choose gifts for your wedding party that they will not need for the wedding, then consider giving them on the day of the wedding. Do it early, though, so the task doesn't get forgotten in the chaos of the day.

Choose an A-line fit for a pear-shape or apple-shape.,
Choose a supportive dress for a busty body type.,
Pick an empire dress for a plus-sized body type.,
Pick a dress that creates verticality for petite body types.,
Choose a sheath or flared dress for long and lean body types.,
Remember that you know yourself best.",How to Choose a Wedding Dress1," One of the most important aspects of the dress is the fit. Before you go shopping, you should figure out what fit you are looking for. If you have a small bust and shapely thighs and hips, think about an A-line fit.A-lines usually have a fitted bodice with a skirt that flares gently from the waist to form an ""A"" shape. They work for most body types and are a particularly good choice for pear shapes, or someone who does not want a tight fit on their lower body.
You can accentuate your waist further by picking a dress with a decorative element like a sash or beading around the waist of the dress.
Avoid a dress that is bunchy or overly embellished on the bottom half. This will make your hips and thighs look larger than they are.;
, If you have a large bust, you will want a fit that is supportive on top. You should consider a dress with boning or with a built-in corset. This kind of fit will give you the shape you want and will prevent any mishaps on your wedding day!Many busty women feel they can’t wear strapless dresses. You can still wear a strapless dress, but to make yourself feel more comfortable on the day, make sure it fits to a tee.
A square-neck dress is a great option for busty women because it shows off your assets without showing too much.

, An empire dress is similar to an A-line dress, except that it cinches under the bust and flows out to make a floor-length A-line. This fit is very flattering on most body types, and is a good option if you don’t want to wear a tight-fitting dress.Though empire dresses are flowy, don’t pick one that is too large or has a lot of excess fabric. You still want to accentuate your figure.

, Avoid any dresses that have any kind of horizontal detailing like beading or striping. Focus instead on finding a dress that has vertical elements like a plunging neckline, vertical paneling or vertical embellishments.An empire fit can also flatter a petite body type by accentuating the bust and creating the appearance of long legs.

, If you are thin and tall, you may either want to highlight your statuesque physique, or you may want to choose a dress that creates curves. Depending on how you feel individually, pick either a sheath dress that follows the long straight form of your body, or a flared dress like a mermaid cut that creates curves and breaks up your body. A sheath dress isn’t necessarily tight, but it won’t conceal the shape of your body. If you feel especially self-conscious about a certain part of your body, consider a different fit.

, There are a lot of conventions about which dress looks best on which body type, and generally they are great places to start from. But you want to be careful that you don’t pick a fit you don’t like or are not comfortable with.


A great way to figure out what fit is best for you individually is to look at the dresses you already own. Although they are much less formal than your wedding dress will be, figure out what fit you generally wear and feel comfortable in.
Another way to find the best cut is to think about your favorite feature and find a way to flaunt it. For example, if you have toned arms, find a sleeveless dress so that you can show them off.
Accentuating a body part doesn’t necessarily mean exposing it. Be careful of showing too much leg or cleavage, as showing too much skin can make your dress look less formal.

Look at bridal magazines.,
Narrow down the characteristics of your ideal dress.,
Use the Internet to individualize your research.,
Make a collage of your favorite styles.,
Consolidate your research.",How to Choose a Wedding Dress2," Bridal magazines are a great way to get a fuller sense of what kinds of dresses are on the market. Even though you may have an idea of what kind of fit you’re looking for, there are still many other factors to choosing the perfect dress., Apart from fit, there are also several other elements that are important to narrow down what style of dress you want. Picking out how you want your ideal dress to look mostly has to do with personal preference and style.


Think about the neckline of your dress. Do you prefer a high neck, a scoop neck, a V-neck, or another kind of neckline?
Consider whether you prefer the look of gauzy, flowy dresses or ones that are more fitted.
Think about the color of your ideal dress. Is it a traditional white dress or another color? If you like white dresses, think about whether you like pure white or a shade of off-white.
Think about what length you would like, and what would suit you.
Also consider what amount of detailing you want for your dress. While some brides like intricate beading and embellishments, some prefer unembellished gowns where the fabric and the cut make the statement.

, The Internet is another great resource to turn to. Not only are there thousands of great sites that have wedding dress picture galleries, but you can also search for your preference in dresses. Now that you have narrowed down the unique characteristics of your dress, do a Google search of these elements for inspiration.You can Google phrases like “glittery wedding gown” or “V neck wedding dress” if you have a sense of what you want your dress to look like beyond its fit.

, Take images that you have collected of your favorite wedding dresses and styles. You can print them out to make a physical collage, or you can make a Pinterest board so you can access the pictures from your computer.Sometimes making a collage or board can make sense of what kind of dresses you like. You may not really know why you like a dress when you look at it individually, but if you put pictures together of different dresses you like, you may start to see similarities in style.

, Before you go shopping for dresses, you want to make sure that you have all your research with you. This can make the whole process of shopping easier, and it will help whoever is fitting you know what you want. Make sure to consolidate your research, whether it be pictures, collages or notes. You can even create a kind of “mission statement” from your research, something like “I am looking for an off-white floor-length empire dress.”

Consider your finances.,
Factor in dress adjustments.,
Factor in accessories.,
Run your dress budget by your fiancée.,
Go to sample sales to save money.,
Consider used dresses.,
Plan your shopping for the right time.,
Consider a simple design.",How to Choose a Wedding Dress3," You have probably have some kind of wedding budget. Many experts advise to factor 8-10 percent of your budget for your attire. This should give you some idea of how much you have to work with. If you are not sure what the state of the wedding finances are, try to figure it out or ask your fiancée before shopping. , Getting a wedding dress isn’t just about buying the dress from the store. You also may have to alter or adjust your dress. Make sure to give yourself enough flexibility to be able to afford this. Factoring in dress tailoring can take some of the pressure off of choosing a dress, because it can be hard to find a dress that fits exactly.Many bridal shops have in-house tailors. If you want to estimate the cost of these adjustments, call a range of in-house tailors to get a rough estimate of how much an adjustment would be.
You can also call other tailors in your city and see how much wedding dress alterations usually cost.
Keep in mind that since you don’t know what kind of alterations you may need, you only will be receiving a general estimate.

, Don’t think of your wedding attire as only your dress. You will probably need to buy accessories like a veil, shoes and jewelry. Do some quick research to find out prices for these items, and take them out of the budget. Don’t forget to budget hair and makeup either. They are factors that sometimes slip between the cracks when establishing a budget for your wedding look. , It may not be romantic, but you should run your wedding dress budget by your fiancée before shopping. It would be a shame to buy a dress you love and have to return it because you and your fiancée aren’t on the same page.


If your fiancé is not involved in the cost of your wedding attire, you don’t have to consult him. However, if your parents or anyone else is involved in paying, you should talk with them before buying the dress.

, Sample sales are sales that sell last season’s gowns at huge discounts. These gowns are not less stylish than current styles, they are only on sale because the retailers need to get rid of their old stock. These sales can save you money and get you a stylish dress for your wedding., There are great used wedding dresses on the market that look like new. Since wedding dresses are often sold after the wedding, you can buy a gown that has only been worn once and looks like new. Used dresses can save you a significant amount of money.Be sure to inspect the dress carefully for any stains or discolorations before purchasing.

, Try shopping for a wedding dress during winter and summer. A lot of major designers and retailers have sales these times of year, which could save you money.If you can’t shop during this time, try to find sales going on that you can go to.

, Choose a classic or simple design for your wedding dress. Decorative elements like beading and embroidering raise the price of a gown. The simpler the dress, the less work-intensive it is to make and the cheaper the dress will be.If you purchase a simple dress, you can use accessories to embellish your look.

Research bridal shops or boutiques in your area.,
Start early.,
Set up appointments.,
Be prepared for the appointment.,
Bring along one or two trusted people.,
Let the salespeople know what you are looking for.,
Be realistic about size.,
Take pictures or videos.,
Go to several shops.,
Shop online for a wedding dress.",How to Choose a Wedding Dress4," Use the Internet or word of mouth to find some places that you want to visit. Before booking an appointment, look on their website to get an idea of their general price range. This can help you to eliminate shops that may be outside your budget. There are some chain bridal shops, such as David’s Bridal, that have a very wide selection of dresses at low prices.
Boutique bridal shops are small, independently owned shops that generally have a smaller range of dresses at higher prices than bridal chains. However, the quality of these dresses are usually better, and they may offer styles that would be hard to find elsewhere.

, You want to give yourself enough time to find the right dress. While there isn’t a set time when you must start looking, it may be wise to start about nine months before your wedding. You search will involve visiting several different stores and boutiques, and also possibly getting your dress altered. This is why starting far in advance can be helpful.Starting early is also a good idea because will cut down your stress level. You will be glad to not have to stress about your dress when you are coordinating all the other factors of your wedding.

, After you have found several shops you want to visit, call them to set up an appointment. Before making the appointment, tell them your budget and a rough idea of what kind of dress you are looking for. If they say that they have dresses that fit your preferences, go ahead and schedule an appointment. , Make sure to wear the same kind of undergarments and shoes that you plan to wear on your wedding day. Also make sure to take a little time on your appearance. This will help you be able to really envision how you will look on your wedding day., You want a couple people to come with you to dress fittings, whether it be friends or family. Sometimes you can get overwhelmed, or fall in love with the style of a dress without realizing that it doesn’t fit you right. This is why having someone at your appointments is so valuable. Try not to invite too many people. Their conflicting opinions could be more confusing than helpful.

, The stores may have already set aside some dresses for you if you told them what you were looking for when you called to make the appointment. Show them any pictures you’ve brought with you, and make sure that they know what your budget is. This can save you a lot of time when you are picking out dresses., Don’t consider dresses that are too small for you with the assumption you can lose weight before the wedding. Make sure that the dress you pick out is your size, and that it will be your size even if you gain a couple pounds before the wedding.


Keep in mind that wedding dress sizing is usually larger than the sizing of regular clothing. Even if you are size 6 in dresses normally, you may be a larger size in wedding dresses., If you find a dress that you love, take photos from several angles, including close-ups. Also consider taking a video of you turning in the dress and walking in it. This will help to jog your memory and to be able to compare the dresses to one another., Even if you find a dress you absolutely love at the first store, make sure to go to several places. Your never know if you will find a better option after you see more dresses. If you are done shopping and you think you have found the dress for you, sleep on it for a couple days just to make absolutely sure it’s the one for you.


Do not go to more than two or three appointments per day. Wedding dress appointments usually last around one and a half hours, so you don't want to make yourself too tired or overwhelmed., If you want to forgo the process of going to multiple stores, think about shopping online for a dress. You may find options that better suit your budget and personal style. Just like with dress fittings at dress stores, make sure to get the input of family or friends."

",How to Choose Flowers for Your Wedding Day," It is your own personal choice, as your own preferences are the most important part, as well as having a basic understanding of what works well for the theme you've chosen and your budget. You can also expect a good florist to provide you with helpful advice, so be prepared to ask plenty of questions and to run ideas past your florist once you reach that stage. Some basics to grasp before getting into the details include:


Remember that less is more. Flowers are the splash of color, the ornamentation on top of many other already beautiful parts of a wedding.
Good positioning and use of inexpensive foliage can create the sense that you have more floral arrangements than you actually do.
Your florist must share your vision, or it's time to find one who does.;
, If you don't already have an idea of the types of flowers you'd like to have, simply looking at beautifully photographed flowers can be a lovely way to start getting an idea of what you like. Even consider taking a tour of a local Botanical Garden or a greenhouse where flowers are on display, to get a real feel for how the flowers appear.


Learn the different meanings of the flowers so that this can play a part in your decision; you might want to express certain sentiments through the ""language of flowers"". Read How to express yourself using the language of flowers to find the meanings of flowers with accompanying images.
There are some classic wedding flowers with which you can't go wrong. They are: roses, peony, lily of the valley, hydrangea, orchid, and calla lily. This doesn't mean you must have any of these flowers but it can help you when deciding to know that these classics are sound choices.

, Before you get too excited, do the sums. Some floral arrangements might not be realistic once you have budgeted for everything else, so it's a good idea to know how much you have to spend on flowers before getting your hopes up. When you visit the florist, you can discuss the extent of your budget and work from there. It's a good idea to keep some flowers on your ""must-have"" list and some on your ""wish-list"", so that if you do have to pare down, the wish-list flowers can go first without depleting the flowers that you must have. See the ""Tips"" below for an indication of essential flowers versus nice-but-not-necessary ones, if the budget can't stretch that far.


Be prepared to be more creative if you're on a budget.
Don't hedge around the cost with your florist. Be honest if you can't afford much; it'll help your florist look for cheaper but just as lovely alternatives early on.
Use expensive flowers sparingly, such as for the bridal bouquet only.
Centerpieces soon add up. Consider finding less elaborate centerpieces to reduce the costs if your budget is tight.
Feel free to mix and match flower types and to raid the garden as well. All flowers are beautiful, whether they're cheap or expensive; the important thing is freshness and a price you can afford.
Use fragrant flowers to give the impression that there are more flowers; stronger smelling flowers will perfume a room with ease (for example, frangipani, lilies, hyacinths, jasmine, and sweet peas).

, Color is an important part of your decision about which flowers to have. The colors chosen should complement the bridal gown, the wedding theme, and the clothing of the rest of the bridal party. Colors chosen according to the seasonal availability will allow you the greatest impact for the smaller price, as seasonal flowers will always cost less. When thinking about color, consider what the flowers have to contend with in the room, marquee, or outdoor area where they're located and be sure to choose colors that will stand out. Some of the more popular flowers by color choice include:



White: rose, sweet pea, camellia, stephanotis, narcissus, gardenia, orchid, lily of the valley, jasmine, and snowdrop.

Pink: rose, ranunculus, peony, sweet pea, carnation, tulip, protea, boronia, and lily.

Lavender: lavender, lilac, anemone, statice, iris, delphinium, and hydrangea.

Yellow: daffodil, sunflower, tulip, gerbera, lily, and freesia.

Red: gerbera, rose, dahlia, poinsettia, and amaryllis.

, The season plays an important role in your choice, especially if you're budget-conscious. While non-seasonal flowers can be flown in, this increases the cost and complexity considerably. And if you're into locally grown produce, it's hardly appropriate to have flowers flown in! Some of the more well-known, popular flowers are indicated alongside their season here (noting that there may be regional and climate variances depending on where you live in the world):



Spring flowers: amaryllis, anemone, daffodil, freesia, gerbera, lily of the valley, orchid, ranunculus, stephanotis, and sweet pea.

Summer flowers: anthurium, carnation, chrysanthemum, gypsophila, lily, magnolia, peony, rose, and sunflower.

Autumn/fall flowers: agapanthus, aster, clematis, daisy, hosta, hydrangea, passion flower, and pinks.

Winter flowers: camellia, euphorbia, iris, nerine, pansy, poinsettia, snowdrop, tulip.

All year round flowers: calla lily, carnation, gypsophila, orchid, protea, rose, and tulip (although this list may vary by region).

, Wedding flowers can be simple or elaborate depending on the type of wedding that is being planned. Either way, they should have a look of individuality and look as if they have all been specially created for the bride. Flowers are suitable for the following places and arrangements:


The bridal bouquet, and bouquets for the wedding party members (see below).
Flowers for the church or other place of marriage); flowers can be placed at the end of pews, on the altar, chancel steps, windowsills, around candelabra etc. Floral displays in most churches need to be large to be effective in the huge space of the church; if you have a tight budget, in some cases, you might even share the cost of the flowers in a church wedding if there is another wedding on the same day; that's totally up to your preferences though). Note that some clergy will oppose decoration of the altar.
A register or registry office building or town hall may be less willing to have your own flowers but it's worth asking if you can bring in one special arrangement of your own.
A decorated bridal arch or arbor.
A carpet of fresh petals for an outside wedding.
Tables at a sit-down dinner.
Flowers around a hall, marquee, dance area for the reception.

, This is the most intimate floral arrangement for the wedding and if you can't afford many flowers, at least don't skimp on the bouquet! The bride's bouquet should be the largest and most spectacular bouquet in the wedding party. White is still traditionally the most popular color for the bride's bouquet, but many different colors are used in weddings today for the bride and bridesmaids from soft pastels such as pale pink through to rich, vibrant colors such as hot pink, burgundy and violets. Ultimately, the choice of flowers for the bouquet depend on what you want, the style of your dress, your height and your wedding theme. It is recommended that you don't finalize the bouquet until you have chosen your dress, because the two must match perfectly, and usually the larger the dress, the larger the bouquet.


There are various styles of bouquets. These include round, trailer, sheaf, crescent, line, and cascade bouquets:

Round bouquets are a popular choice for many brides. This style is usually used for large flowers such as roses or peonies, loosely arranged with foliage and tied with a ribbon.
Large trailing bouquets (a cascade) are particularly suited to romantic style wedding gowns. They will only work well with larger dresses though; they overpower anything slinky or close-fitting. These usually consist of flowers wired to a handle; it is both the most traditional and most formal form of bouquet shapes.
Tied bouquets are hand tied casually or wound together with wire. This style goes best with a modern, simple dress at a contemporary wedding.
A posy is a minimalist approach that is very small and usually hand-tied with ribbon; lily of the valley is an ideal flower for this type of bouquet.
A pomander bouquet is usually made without the addition of foliage and it can be suspended on a ribbon for the bride to wear on her wrist.
An elegant line bouquet of lilies is a good choice for a slim-fitting gown.
A modern style bouquet made of exotic flowers and tropical foliage will suit the contemporary bride.


Consider additional embellishments to a bouquet:


Pearls and crystals can be incorporated into bouquets for a touch of added glamour.
For a delicate touch sheer organza ribbon can be used to create ribbon bows and long streamers.
Wide satin ribbon will give a rich, luxurious look.



, The bridesmaids' flowers can be a smaller version of the brides flowers or a different shape but still maintaining the color theme. If the bride is carrying a trailing bouquet the bridesmaids could carry round bouquets. Each of the bouquets can be the same color as the brides bouquet. If you do select a different color, ensure that it blends well with the bridal bouquet and the overall wedding color theme. Ultimately, aim for good coordination.


To give a different look, the bridesmaids could carry elegant evening bags filled with flowers. The bag would need to be lined with a piece of plastic to prevent staining the inside of the bag. A piece of soaked florist foam can be placed in the bag and the flowers and foliage arranged in the foam to extend gracefully from the top of the bag.

, This daintiest member of the wedding party could carry a small basket of flowers to match the bridesmaids' flowers. The basket can be sprayed white or a pastel shade. Another alternative is to attach a spray of flowers to a piece of ribbon and tie it around the flower girl's wrist, tying the ribbon ends in a bow with long ends. This is particularly suitable for a very young flower girl who may find a basket awkward to carry.


One delightful variation is to just give the flower girl rose or other petals in her basket and to ask her to scatter the flowers down the aisle. Naturally, clear this with the wedding officiant and/or building owner first.
Consider a floral bracelet and/or a floral hair ornament to adorn the flower girl. A floral wreath that sits on the hair like a fairy or nymph is another pretty variation. She'll be super delighted with these special touches.
Consider giving flower girls under 5 a teddy bear or other soft toy with its own corsage. The soft toy can be kept afterward as a thank-you gift.

, Although their need for flowers is less showy, it's just as important, and they will wear a buttonhole/boutonniere. For the groom, provide something that has a slight difference from the buttonholes for the groomsmen – such as a single flower that is the same as one in the bridal bouquet. Flowers that are popular for buttonholes include roses, carnations, orchids, and small varieties of lily. Lily of the valley is popular for buttonholes because it is an expensive flower but goes a long way in a buttonhole.


Consider giving the father of the bride ad groom a special buttonhole of their own.
If you have the budget and the inclination, you could also leave buttonholes in a dish for all guests to take as they enter the church or area where you're getting married.

, Both the mother of the bride and the mother of the groom wear corsages. These should complement their outfits. The standard corsage flowers include roses, orchids, camellias, and gardenias.


Often grandmothers and special aunts will wear corsages too.
It is helpful to know the color of the dresses of those wearing corsages, to ensure that the colors will not clash – white or cream is always a safe, neutral choice.

, If you're making a centerpiece, or putting some bouquets in vases, you will need to choose your vases prior to your wedding. You can figure out your arrangements first and then select vases to match. However, if you have your heart set on a particular type of face, you can choose and arrange flowers based on vase type.Remember size when selecting vases. Where will they be displayed? If you have a centerpiece for a large table, you can select a larger vase. For smaller tables, you may need smaller vases.
Also, think about color. You want to choose vases with colors that will match your wedding color scheme and chosen flowers.

, If you're planning other aspects of your wedding, you may need help from others. It's a tremendous amount of work to select and arrange flowers on your own.Reach out to your wedding party. Groomsmen or bridesmaids may be able to help with flower arraignments.
If necessary, get professional help. It can be costly to have professional arrangements, but it may be worth it if you're pressed for time.

, Centerpieces come in many styles. As you assemble yours, you will have to keep the style you want in mind. This will dictate how you arrange your flowers.A rustic style has an asymmetrical shape with flowers of mixed textures and colors assorted randomly. It can be great for a more casual outdoor wedding.
A classic centerpiece is great if you're using light colored flowers. It's usually arranged very uniformly, with flowers of the same shape and color, and is a smaller arrangement. Classic centerpieces may work for smaller tables at the reception.
You can try a modern style, which is usually smaller and more minimalistic. It only uses one type of flower, and usually uses more colorful, exotic flowers.
If you want a very glamorous centerpiece, you can make one with cascading flowers. That means flowers spill out by their stems. These also tend to use many types of flowers and colors.

, Regardless of the style you choose, you need to prep your flowers before assembling your centerpiece. To do so, remove excess leaves and foliage with your hands or stem trimmers. You should also cut the stems evenly at an angle, about 2 inches from the bottom., All arrangements should start with the same base. This allows you to build the shape you want from a firm foundation. Hold the flowers in place with one hand and insert new flowers in the other.Take four flowers of even height and shape. Arrange them in a square shape.
Create a dome shape around this by adding more flowers circling the square center.

, Keep adding flowers around your base, keeping the shape you want in mind. All the flowers should be inserted near the base to keep the bouquet secure.Remember the design you want. For example, if you want a glamorous, cascading bouquet, only attach the tips of the stem to the base so the flowers hang down.
Your design can also help you select the types of flowers as you assemble. For a more classic design, for example, you would opt for flowers of the same shape and color.

, Once you've completed the centerpiece, hold it up against your container. You want to see how much of the stems you need to trim to fit the centerpiece inside.Once you've determined how to trim the stems, clip them to the desired length.

, A secure base will allow you to build your specific style. Use floral tape to bind the base together at the spot where the stems join naturally. Bind downward until your'e about an two inches from the ends of the stems., There are many different styles when it comes to wedding bouquets. Select a style that matches your dream for your special day.If you want a more uniform bouquet, go for a beidermeier design. This is a bouquet made up of a series of circles. This is great if you're working with flowers of the same colors and shapes.
A cascade design anchors flowers at the tips of the stems, so they spill out in a waterfall-like fashion. This works great for a more bohemian, glamorous feel.
Classic hand-tied bouquets and nosegays work great for traditional weddings. They usually involve a single flower color in a circular, dome-like shape.

, Before you begin making your bouquet, get your flowers ready. Snip off any damaged petals, thorns, or excess leaves. Keep the stems somewhat long., Use one hand to hold your flowers and another to assemble them. Start by placing four flowers in a square shape. This is the foundation of your base. Then, you can begin arranging your flowers., Place the flowers into the bouquet one by one. Make sure to create the shape you want as you go.Keep your shape in mind. If you're doing a beidermeier design, for example, make small circles of flowers of the same size and shape.
Keep arranging your flowers until the bouquet is as big as you desire.

, Tape the bouquet with floral tape at the spot where they naturally join. From there, work the tape down the stem until two inches of stem left. Trim the stems so they're about the same length."

There are many varieties of trains, the most popular being the Chapel, which extends about four feet (1.2 meters) from the waist, and the Cathedral, which extends about seven feet (2.1 meters) from the waist.

, If you decide to get a train for your wedding dress, decide if you want to get a bustle. A bustle holds up your train so that after the ceremony, no one trips or steps on your train.

, After you have purchased your dress and accessories, try on your wedding outfit to make sure that everything is exactly as you want it. If you’re satisfied with how everything looks, store your wedding dress in a garment bag to protect the dress from any light exposure or staining that could happen before the big day.

Traditional or classic wedding photography.,
Contemporary or modern wedding photography.,
Reportage or documentary style photography.,
Consider artistic wedding photography.",How to Choose Between the Different Wedding Photography Styles," This style of photography is characterized by a very formal approach. The images are usually highly posed and will require a good deal of intervention from the photographer (unless the bride and groom are experienced models and know how to pose). Be aware that this style will impact you in the following ways:


The photographer will work to a time line - often with specific shots being organized at a very specific time.
In some cases – the photographer will seem like a film director on a movie set, constantly organizing individuals into posed groups to produce a set of traditional wedding images.
Although considered out of date by many, traditional style images will still appeal to the older generation, so older relatives of the bride & groom are likely to be happier with this type of image.
The downside for many modern brides is that the resulting images can appear very stiff and rigid – and so fail to fully convey the air of happiness and fun that is part of many modern ceremonies.
However, many modern photographers pull in elements of classic wedding photography successfully. The classics were classic for a reason, and being able to modernize a classic pose rather than disregard it altogether can help retain a timeless feel and prevent photos from becoming dated too quickly.;
, This style is characterized by a far greater degree of informality and a more relaxed approach by the photographer. This can result in a greater level of spontaneity and is capable of capturing the spirit of fun, as well as some of the more formal elements – as the photographer will not be posing people to the same degree:


There is less need for the photographer to intervene – much less of the photographer as Director of the movie of your day.
This style is likely to produce a unique record of your day – no two weddings will look exactly the same. As a result, this style has gradually gained in popularity in comparison to the more traditional approach.
The photographer will seek out great backgrounds and settings which can result in a stylish set of images which may resemble to a degree the kind of images you may see in a fashion magazine.
If overdone, the modern wedding style can descend into cheesiness if the style is not refined. Be wary of photographers that chase the latest trends as they can quickly become dated.

, This style is characterized by an extremely hands-off approach by the photographer who will record the events of your big day as they happen in the manner of a fly-on-the-wall documentary television crew. Much of the time – the photographer will essentially be in the background; you may not even be aware of his presence! There will be very little in the way of posing or organizing of individuals and groups. For this reason – this style is increasingly popular with brides today – as it does allow a lot of freedom of movement and the bride and groom are essentially left to enjoy their big day. This style of photography:


Is likely to produce a very candid record of your wedding with a high proportion of unusual shots that you probably would not expect from traditional or contemporary styles.
If you have been posed for all your photographs – then you essentially have already seen the images – and there will be none of the ‘wow’ factor that you may get from a reportage image of you and the groom in an unguarded kiss or embrace.
Reportage photography has a great deal to offer but inevitably – the drawback is that you simply cannot be sure what you may get in the end!
Being able to pull off this style arguably requires greater skill than any other style. Many unskilled photographers refer to themselves as documentary photographers because they don't know how to pose or light. It takes exceptional skill to be able to anticipate moments before they happen and be ready to capture them as quickly as they disappear.

, This, as the name implies, is led by the individualism of the ‘Artist’ or photographer. This style is therefore characterized by its ability to produce a unique set of images from your big day. Depending on the photographer – there may be a great deal of intervention - or there may be none. The only way to assess if this style suits you is by checking out the portfolios of particular photographers to see if their style is going to appeal. This type of photography can produce cutting edge and stunning wedding photographs as a superb and individualized record of your big day. It may well be considered a little risky by some brides.

Select a theme for your cake.,
Match your wedding style to your cake.,
Be realistic.",How to Choose Colors for Your Wedding Cake1," If your wedding has a theme, match your cake to that. This is a cake that you will want your guests to photograph for their Instagram accounts, so choose a memorable and quirky design to match you and your partner's personalities. If your cake will be on display throughout your celebration meal, make sure your color choices don't clash.For instance, a fall-themed cake could have autumn colors, a winter wedding could have a white/silver/blue cake, and a tropical destination wedding could have a vibrantly-colored cake.;
, There are many different styles you can pick for your wedding, and they can range greatly in terms of formality and atmosphere. The cake colors you’d have for a rustic mountain wedding would most likely be different than the cake colors you’d choose for an elegant evening wedding.

If the dress code for your wedding is black tie and the theme is a more traditional and sophisticated wedding, then choose simple and elegant colors, such as black and white.
If you are having a more relaxed, boho wedding, or a nature-inspired wedding, you can choose colors found in nature, such as green or yellow.
If your wedding style is bold and adventurous, then go for a purple ombre frosted cake, or consider red velvet cake with white frosting.

, If an amateur baker has offered to make your wedding cake or if you can't set aside much of your wedding budget on cake, you might want to go with a more simple cake design. Simplicity can be quite elegant, so don't stress about spending all of your wedding money on the cake.

Colors of frosting may stain the cake itself, and it might be difficult to slice if you pick a lot of decorations, so take each detail into consideration.

Consider your wedding colors and pick a cake that reflects them.,
Create a complementary color scheme.,
Choose decorations that are meaningful to you.",How to Choose Colors for Your Wedding Cake2," Cutting your wedding cake will be one of the highlights of your reception, so be sure that your color choices are relevant to your overall color scheme.For instance, if your color scheme is cream and cooler dark colors, you might have a cream wedding cake with forest green and navy details.

, Consider which colors your wedding party will be wearing. It can be fun to have the accents of the cake match the dresses of your bridesmaids. You can also have fun with the cake colors by becoming inspired by the location of your wedding.

If you are getting married on a beach, for instance, consider getting a cake that incorporates a pastel color, such as baby blue., You may want to select a color palette that is particularly symbolic to you and your beau. Wedding cake can be frosted or iced to imitate works of art, photographs of the couple, a favorite location, flowers, and anything else that your heart desires."
"
Take your budget into account.,
Pick your favorite flavor.,
Ask the cake decorator for recommendations.,
Get inspired by cakes from around the world.",How to Choose Colors for Your Wedding Cake3," You can choose a fancier wedding cake with vivid colors if you want to allocate the funds to this. However, a simple cake with only one or two colors can look quite elegant, so don't stress out if you cannot afford one that you see on television or advertised in a magazine., The taste of your cake is just as important as the look, so be sure to take flavor into consideration. Decide if you would like the flavors of your cake to influence the colors you choose.

A rich chocolate cake will be brown in color, but you can still choose any color for the frosting, icing, or decoration.
A delicately-flavored vanilla sponge cake might not suit dark purple frosting with bright orange sugar flowers, for instance, but the choice is yours., They will let you know which colors they have available. Be as specific as you can about your vision of which shade of the colors you would like to choose. If they can't make you a cake in the exact shade you want, you may want to choose another wedding cake maker, or compromise with the closest shade possible.

Ask for a cake consultation in advance of your wedding. The baker will inform you about prices, let you sample various flavors, and discuss color options for your cake. Consultations typically run from 20 minutes to an hour and can cost around $50., Remember that you don't have to be wildly extravagant. There's nothing wrong with a traditional rich fruit cake, decorated with white icing with sugar flowers that match the bride's bouquet, for example. Consider colors that are traditional to your country or culture, or research various types of wedding cakes from around the world."

Take some time to read up on and learn about the different styles and think about which one suits you best. Some of the main wedding photography styles are as follows:


Traditional, or classic: here a photographer will work from a ‘shot list’ to make sure that they capture all the traditional pictures, and those the couple have specifically requested.
Photojournalism: this is more of a documentary-style, where the photographers will follow you and take fewer ‘posed’ pictures, instead trying to tell the story of your wedding in a normal naturalistic style.
Illustrative photography: this style is a combination of the first two. It includes posed pictures, but there is more emphasis put on relaxed and informal poses, albeit still with careful composition.
Fashion: this style tends to be more dramatic than the others, and will make the subjects appear more glamorous and styled.;
, Booking your wedding photographer should be one of the first things you do after you have booked your venue. Wedding photographers are in high demand, especially in the busiest times of year for weddings, and many of the best ones will be booked up a year in advance.


If you are having an out-of-season wedding, or getting married on a Sunday, a top photographer will be easier to find at relatively short notice.
For weddings at the most popular times, look at least a year in advance.
For weddings at less popular times, six months might be enough., The best wedding photographers will tend to develop a reputation, and may be known locally to your friends are family. Start your search by asking people you know and trust if they have any recommendations, either through personal experience, or word of mouth. Talk to people you know who have got married in the last few years and ask about their experience.


If a friend recommends the photographer she used for her wedding, ask to look the album of photos.
Bear in mind that people have different tastes and ideas for what makes good wedding photography.
You can also ask any other professionals you are hiring to work on your wedding. A wedding planner will have excellent contacts., It may be tempting to hire somebody you know to be your wedding photographer. You may be drawn towards hiring someone you trust, who knows you and your partner well, and you think will understand what kind of pictures you want. While this might turn out perfectly well, it is highly likely that this person will not have the technical skills and experience to give you the best photos.Consider if this person has the technical knowledge of light and photography to anticipate and quickly correct any problems that may occur.
Ask yourself if she has a spare camera of high quality.
Does she have experience working with large groups of people?
Would she be able and happy to spend all day, maybe 8-12 hours, behind the camera and not participating in the wedding as a guest?, A great way to search for wedding photographers is to look online. There will be a very large number of people advertising their services, so think about how you can focus your search more closely and narrow down the results. Look for people with plenty of experience and lots of information about themselves and the photography they produce. You should also look to see if they work with an assistant or solo.You can search for people in a specific location, like your city.
Look for photographers according to their particular style.
Think about your budget and pay attention to the rates quoted by the various photographers you find online.

, As with anybody advertising themselves on the internet you will need to think carefully and critically about how they present themselves. Try to find reviews of the people you are interested in by searching for their names. You should be cautious with reviews and be prepared to make up your own mind, but the more information you have the better.


Be cautious of being influenced too heavily by images on the website of a photographer.
Although this is a great way to get a feel of the photographer’s work, there have been instances where people have stolen or bought photos taken by somebody else, and presented them as their own.Try to research the candidates fully to avoid any potential scams or tricks.

, Once you have been through the profiles and seen some of the photography of a number of wedding photographers, you need to narrow this down to a manageable number. Then you can arrange to meet, interview, and inspect the portfolios of your chosen few. Think carefully about who you want to interview, and consider what elements are most important to you.


It can be hard to judge somebody from a website, but you should be trying to get a picture of their personality, as well as their technical skills and personal style.
Think about whether you want contemporary, documentary, or perhaps fashion-style photographs.Consider including somebody on your shortlist who is a little over your budget. It could be useful exercise to evaluate what each photographer provides for the money charged., Once you have drawn up your shortlist and arranged the interviews, you should spend some time preparing together with your partner. You will need to draw up a list of specific questions that you want to ask, as well as thinking about the soft skills that you will want your photographer to possess.


Talk it through carefully with your partner to make sure you both understand each other’s concerns before the interview.
Consider whether to meet the photographer at her studio, or ask her to visit you at home.
Be sure to take plenty of notes during the interview so you can look back and discuss them with your partner.

, The first thing to discuss is the style and ideas of the photographer. You will have seen some pictures, but you will be able to get better and more complete understanding by talking it through in person. Ask the photographer to describe the style they shoot in, and be sure to ask any further questions if anything is unclear to you.Having a good understanding of the different wedding photography styles will help you have a better conversation.
Present your ideas, but try to keep an open mind and listen to what the photographer has to say.

, One of the key things to talk about in the interview is the level of experience each of the photographers have gained. You should ask how many weddings the photographer has shot, and how many similar to yours. Different weddings have can hugely different requirements and expectations, so it’s important that you understand how much experience they have that is especially relevant to you.


Find out if they are a specialist wedding photographer, or if they photograph various different events.
A specialist whose style and experience is closely related to what you want from your wedding photos is the ideal scenario.Be sure to ask for a list of references from the photographer.

, You should always ask the photographer if the deal they are offering includes an assistant to help them with the work on the day. Having an assistant, especially if the wedding has more than around 50 people, is likely to be an important addition.


It won’t be possible for one person to capture everything.
Having an assistant will mean you get pictures of the bride and groom saying the vows, as well as the reaction of the guests., You should ask about how the photographer does the post-production on the photos, or if they do any post-production on the photos at all. You may get the photos straight from the camera, which may not look as good as those which go through post-production.Colour correction is a basic part of post-production, and can make a big difference.
Be sure you are completely clear on the photographer’s practices.
If post-production is not included in the main price, ask if it is an optional extra.

, It’s important to find out detailed information about how the photographer will work on the day of wedding. You need to determine whether they are prepared to stay a little later if it runs on, and how they plan to interact with the guests. Will they be taking lots of candid shots, or will they be corralling people around a lot.


If they are going to very hands-on and active, you should make sure that this won’t be a distraction or annoyance.
Don’t forget to ask how they plan to be dressed, and be sure to make your expectations clear.
If you have specific sartorial requirements you should explain these and be sure the photographer understands them fully., Find out how long you can expect to wait for the pictures, and in what format they will be presented. You need to make sure you know what your photographer will pass on to you at end of the process. The number of photos, the format and resolution of the photos, as well as the way they are presented are all crucial questions.Ask the photographer to go over any details that you are unsure about.
if you don’t have a good understanding of different formats and resolutions of pictures, ask the photographer to show you examples from a portfolio.

, Your potential photographers will bring along a portfolio of their pictures to the interview. It’s important that you spend plenty of time looking through this in detail with your partner. Ask the photographer to give some context for the pictures, including asking about the style used, and the type of wedding it was.


The portfolio is a crucial document that gives you the best idea of what sort of style you photos will be getting.
The pictures will have been carefully chosen to represent what the photographer considers her best work.
Ask yourself if the pictures in the portfolio move you, or you think they capture the magic of the wedding.Be sure to ask if the production values on the pictures in the portfolio are the same as in the deal you are discussing.

, Spend some time looking back through the notes you made during the interview to help you decide. These notes are a record of the interview that can give you a good idea of the impression you got from the photographer. You can compare the scores across the different shortlisted candidates with your partner, and evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses.

, Price will no doubt be a factor in your decision, but try to think carefully about the value of these photos to you. It will be hard to value them quantitatively, as they are a record of the biggest day of your life, which you will always look back on. You will want a photographer that will capture the emotion of the day, as well as all the key moments.


Some people recommend putting aside at least ten per cent of your wedding budget for the photos.Don’t rush the decision, and try to weigh up all of the different factors, including cost.

, You will use the interview in part to determine the technical skills and style of the photographer, but it is also an invaluable opportunity to assess her soft skills. Think about how personable the photographer is. If you take a disliking to her for whatever reason, this could create a negative dynamic or atmosphere on your big day. Keep in mind some basic questions, and discuss your response with your partner after the interview.Ask yourself simply if you liked the photographer.
Do you trust them to handle all the pressures and stresses of a wedding and still deliver great pictures?
Do you feel comfortable around them? Will your friends and family be able to relax and have a good time?"

Pick the perfect color.,
Choose the right size bouquets for your bridesmaids by coordinating them with the size of the people holding them.,
Determine the style of bouquet you want for your bridesmaids by matching it with the style of dress they are wearing.,

A unique idea is to pick a flower from your personal bouquet arrangement and have your bridesmaids carry one or three of that prominent flower, whether it is a rose or a lily.;
, This does not mean that they have to have the same arrangement as you, but it does mean that their bouquets can be a smaller version of yours or that their flowers are the same as yours. For example, your personal arrangement can be a cascading style incorporating red roses and ivy, and their bouquets can be hand held bunches using the same flowers. Don't let them outshine you, whatever you decide. Your bridesmaids' bouquets should be smaller than yours.

, The best way to approach this is to narrow the flower choices to what you want and then ask for their input.

, What is the prominent color of your bouquet? Do you want your bridesmaids' dresses to match that or do you want them to contrast yours by maybe picking up a less prominent color in your bouquet? Do you want their bouquet to match their own dresses, or again, contrast them?

, You want to make sure that the bouquet you choose does not overwhelm the carrier. The bouquet should be just one part of the full ensemble that includes the dress, shoes, and person, but should not make your bridesmaids invisible.

, Again, if the dress is simple, so should be the bouquet. However, if the dress is sleek and only one color, you can afford to have a bouquet that incorporates a few colors. A complex style dress should not have an equally busy bouquet since the ensemble as a whole will look too pretentious. The goal is to coordinate the flowers with the bridesmaids' dresses so that they balance in an aesthetically pleasing fashion.

, In addition, they should complement the dresses and tuxes of your party. Remember that the more attendants you have, the simpler you should keep the bouquets so that the overall picture of your wedding party is not overwhelmed by flowers.

Contact the Music Department at the church where you will be getting married.,
Consider what each piece brings to the ceremony.,
Choose music for the following spots of the Catholic Wedding Mass:


Prelude (3-5 pieces, vocal or instrumental to be played while guests arrive).",How to Choose Catholic Wedding Music," The Music Director usually has a list of music specifically tailored for weddings that you can choose from.


If you are looking at the list and have no idea what these songs sound like, ask to meet with the organist to hear them played.;
, All signs should point to your relationship with God as individuals now becoming a couple. If you have a favorite pop song that you want done, have it done at the reception.

, Your prelude should not be any longer than half an hour, which is usually about 5 or 6 songs.
Piece for the Mothers. This is a piece played right before the processional and, although it does not have to be anything special, it is nice to let Mom know when she walks down the aisle that you appreciate her.
Processional. Sometimes, you will want two processionals: one for the wedding party and one for the Bride. It actually works better for the organist if you can choose a piece that gets louder and more festive as the piece continues so that the big finish is when the bride is walking down the aisle. It builds continuity for your ceremony. Keep in mind that any hymns that you sing should be pointing to the reason that you are there: The love of God for his people.
Responsorial Psalm. Psalms should be sung whenever possible. The cantor for your wedding will want to have plenty of time to prepare the psalm, so don't put off choosing your readings. Choose a Psalm from the wedding planning book you get from the parish when you register to have your wedding. Also, be sure to tell the musicians whether you have chosen to have two readings and a Gospel or just one reading, so they know when to start the Gospel Acclamation.
Gospel Acclamation and Mass Parts. It is usually nice to use Mass parts that the people attending your wedding will be familiar with. If your family is not Catholic, be sure that your cantor knows to sing out. If you family is Catholic, but is from another parish or another city, be sure that the musicians help you choose something that they will know, so they can participate fully in the Mass.
Unity Candle. The Unity Candle is not included in the Rite of Marriage in the Catholic Church. If this is a symbol that you would like to utilize on your special day, consider doing it at the Reception. Have the parents come in and light their candles, and when the Bride and Groom enter, they can kick off the festivities with lighting their Unity Candle on the Head table. If your parish does permit the Unity Candle to be used, be aware that there is never enough time for a whole song to be done. You will want to have the organist pick something short and lovely to play while you light the candle and get back to your places.
Offertory. This should be some sort of song of praise. It can be vocal, instrumental, or even a hymn. Again, consider choosing music that points up God's part in your marriage.
Communion. This is the consummation of the Sacrifice of the Mass and it is the actual high point of your Catholic Wedding. Not only are you two united by the vows you exchanged, but also in the Body and Blood of Christ. As such, your Communion Music should be completely focused on the Eucharist. Choose a song that talks about the Eucharist and why it is important in your life as an individual and as a couple. Depending on how many of your guests are Catholic and will be receiving Communion, you could need a lot of music. Have the organist prepared to play a meditative piece, if you run out of music. Consider your guest list and then decide accordingly.
Meditation. Usually, this is the time when the bride carries her flowers to a statue of Mary and dedicates her newly married life to Mary, the Mother of God. That is why the ""Ave Maria"" is most often done at this point. The ""Ave Maria"" is the prayer ""Hail Mary"" in Latin and set to music. If your parish does not allow the devotional practice of consecrating your marriage to the protection of Our Lady, and you still want this song done, consider it for the prelude.
Recessional. This is the big finish. Usually, the recessional is a big, organ intensive piece played with all the stops out to mirror the joy in your hearts as you first walk down the aisle as Mr. and Mrs. Newlywed.

Try soft greens and browns.,
Pair red and orange.,
Use copper and pink.,
Try muted colors.,
Try rustic.,
Go for a school theme.,
Go spooky with a Halloween theme.,
Think about a fall-leaf theme.,
Look at garden dahlias.,
Opt for cymbidium orchids and calla lilies.,
Add fall touches to a more traditional bouquet.,
Consider dried flowers.,
Try things other than flowers.,
Make use of pumpkins.,
Throw in some leaves.,
Remember the other fall produce.,
Use hay.,
Make a miniature forest.,
Take the temperature into account.",How to Choose Fall Wedding Decorations," While greens are usually associated with spring, they can also do just fine for a fall wedding. Think moss or sage green, paired with a soft chestnut brown. These colors give the wedding a woodsy feel without screaming ""fall.""For instance, you could use natural wood vases with succulents. Then you could use brown chargers with moss green napkins.;
, Red and orange together are a natural for a fall wedding. They give a nod to the changing colors, and bring to mind the warmth of the hearth, as well. You can also add touches of white, so that the other colors don't get too overwhelming.These colors work wonderfully with flowers, such as orange and red roses. You could also use colored glass vases or red table runners.

, If you want to use pink but don't want your colors to feel too springy, try pairing it with copper. A soft pink lends a romantic touch, and the copper accents help to move the color scheme to being more fall-like.For instance, you could use copper chargers and napkin rings, along with vases that have copper accents. Then incorporate the pink in soft pink roses, napkins, or tablecloths.

, No matter what colors you want, choosing more muted tones can help them feel like fall. A bright, turquoise blue screams summer. However, mute that down to a soft grey-blue, and it starts to fit more with fall.For instance, you could pair soft grey-blue napkins with muted orange roses or fall leaves.

, Fall is the perfect time for a more rustic wedding. Rustic weddings lean heavily on country style, including using barns as the location. You can incorporate decorations like burlap table runners, pie bars, and hay bales to create a rustic feel., Fall means back to school, right? You can build a wedding around that theme. Try bouquets of pencils and old books tied up with ribbon as centerpieces. Use apples in your decor, such as poking sticks in them and using the sticks to hold photos. You can also add mini chalkboards to write wedding messages on., If your wedding is before Halloween, think about using that as your theme. You can use some of your favorite spooky characters as decoration or buy up Halloween decorations like skeletons and spider webs. For something a bit classier, you could try fake crows, white candles, and red flowers.Alternatively, have a Thanksgiving-themed wedding. You could go full-out Thanksgiving, with cornucopias and all the traditional Thanksgiving food. Plus, if you have it near Thanksgiving, it gives you a reason to celebrate with your family every year.

, Another option is just embrace the changing colors of fall. You could incorporate fall leaves throughout your decorations, including scattering them around the tables. You could also have vases with bare branches, and other harvest items, such as wheat bundles, apples, pumpkins, and candles.

, For simple elegance, garden dahlias are a good choice. They are understated, yet offer a rich selection of colors. Plus, they don't look like you tried too hard. In fact, you can even pick them from the garden if you have them around.Dahlias make a gorgeous bouquet all on their own. For centerpieces, try adding a few more pieces of greenery in a woodsy vase.

, Another good option for fall flowers is cymbidium orchids and calla lilies. You can find these flowers in peaches, oranges, and scarlet, perfect for a blend of fall colors. Plus, they make for a unique bouquet.You can stick to just the flowers for a bouquet. For a centerpiece, try going simpler. That is, have alternating vases of calla lilies and orchids, with just a few blooms in each vase.

, If roses are more your thing for flowers, you can still have a more autumnal bouquet. Simply add in some pieces that reference fall, such as red fall berries and crab apples.For a centerpiece, think about bringing it together in a pumpkin vase, made by hollowing out a pumpkin. You can use orange or white pumpkins, but the pumpkin will create a striking centerpiece, plus it really hammers home the theme.

, While fresh flowers make a statement in the spring and summer, the muted colors of dried flowers go perfectly with fall. You can even add things like dried eucalyptus, for instance, for a touch of muted green. As an added bonus, this option will usually cost you less than fresh flowers.Because you don't need to add water to these flowers, you can get more creative with the vases for centerpieces. For example, you could use baskets or even burlap bags filled with sand or glass marbles.

, This time of year, you have lots of options for decorative bouquets. For instance, wheat makes a nice addition to a bouquet, and it can even make a whole bouquet if you pair it with a nice ribbon. You can also use small branches with autumn leaves in your bouquet.You can make wheat stalk centerpieces that stand on their own. Just wrap them up in floral tape, then tie them up in a ribbon of your choice. Splay out the bottom so it can stand up. You can also add in some dried grasses for a touch of color., Pumpkins and decorative gourds are abundant in the fall, and if you're having a fall wedding, you'll likely want to make use of them. However, if the bright oranges of pumpkins don't fall into your color scheme, consider spray painting your pumpkins to match your wedding colors.Try using pumpkins in unique ways. For instance, you can hollow out pumpkins to make them into vases for centerpieces.
Another option is using white or dark green gourds to better match your wedding colors.

, Leaves are also a great addition to autumn decor. They can add variety and a wide range of oranges, reds, yellows, and even purples. Plus, they're much cheaper than flowers, so you can buy a lot more to make a big impact.You could also just gather leaves from outside to use in your wedding.

, Apples and pears can also work well in a wedding. You can use them as they are to make centerpieces, or you can spray paint some in metallic colors as a ""neutral"" color. Try piling them on pretty dishes as centerpieces, for instance.If you use pears, make sure to pick ones that are underripe. Harder pears will hold up better.

, For a more down-home flair, try incorporating hay into your wedding. For instance, you can use hay bails as seating at both your wedding and reception. Just be sure to warn your guests, as hay can be scratchy. You can also throw blankets or fabric over them for a slightly classier look., Another way to incorporate a fall theme is to use branches. You can have them along the aisle at the wedding and use them as centerpieces on your table. Try adding colored glass or red feathers to create the effect of leaves., If you're outdoors, your guests may need some help keeping warm, particularly if your wedding day is brisker than you were planning. Consider having shawls and blankets on hand to keep your guests warm. Plus, they can make a cozy decoration, if you roll them up nicely in a pretty container."

Check your body shape.,
Go with a deep neckline.,
Find a cinched waist.,
Select an a-line skirt.,
Avoid high necklines and full skirts.",How to Choose a Wedding Dress for Your Body Type1," If you’re pear-shaped (triangular), your shoulders will be thinner than your hips. Enhance your neckline and hide your hips.;
, Deep necklines and strapless tops work very well for your body shape. The neckline should flatter your shoulders and bust. Sweetheart necklines do double duty by helping to augment your neckline and give you a chance to show off your jewelry., Cinched waists and diagonally draped bodices will draw attention away from your hips. If you go with a cinched waist, you can choose a simple sash or go glam and add in some fancy jewels or beading.

, A-line skirts that flare are a good way to add volume that will decrease the size of your hips. Layers, ruffles, and tulle can make your look pop. Ball gowns are a very good choice to soften your hips.

, Pleating and mermaid silhouettes are also not for you because they will make your hips will look larger.

Opt for a flared skirt.,
Avoid trumpet dress silhouettes.",How to Choose a Wedding Dress for Your Body Type2," You’re apple shaped if you’re full in the waist, but your arms and legs are thin.

, Deep v necklines create a vertical line that will detract attention from the widest part of your waist. Go for bodices that are accented at the neckline with beading or embellishments. Ornamented bodices can visually add weight up top.

, High waistlines, like the type you will find with cinched waists, are your best bet with an apple-shaped body. High waistlines will flow into the skirt, helping to give you an elongated figure., Flared skirts that turn into an A shape will take away from the weight at your waist.

Textures work well, but avoid ornate embellishments.Also avoid drop-waists and calf-length designs as they will make your legs look shorter.
Taller brides may prefer to choose bias cut or sheath dresses. Strapless dresses are also appropriate.Always make sure the sleeves and skirt are long enough to complement your body's proportions.

, These allow the dress to skim your body and give definition to your waist, helping to flatter your curves.Avoid pleating and oversized and/or unfitted gowns, which will visually add weight to your figure.

, A curved neckline will frame your face and collarbone and make your bust area a supporting feature. Avoid strapless gowns with straight horizontal necklines as well as fabrics with sheen and ruching; they will make you appear heavier up top. Going strapless is possible for you. Just pick a built-in corset or boning to help keep your dress from slipping., If you’re curvier, go for a nipped waist with a skirt that falls loosely over your thighs and calves."

Start with the basics: decide what type of cake will match the overall tone of the wedding and the newlyweds' taste.,

Choose the decorative aspect of the wedding cake, which will be defined by the shape, size, and color.,

Visit some wedding bakers to inspect their cakes.,

Arrange the presentation around the formal wedding cake before the reception.",How to Choose a Wedding Cake for a Formal Wedding,"

The formal wedding cakes we know today have their origins in 17th century England, where heavy fruitcakes were served at the wedding to symbolize fertility. But today, many people choose vanilla, lemon, chocolate or carrot cakes.;
,

The main difference between formal wedding cakes and other types of wedding cakes is usually in the style. Formal wedding cakes are elegant and, though they are traditionally eye-catchers, remain within the bounds of traditional wedding colors and decorative styles. Novelty cakes with exceptional forms and colors such as cakes made to look like the newlyweds faces, desert islands, or castles, aren't considered to be formal, though they can be appealing and fun.
If the wedding reception is going to be held in a hall with a high ceiling or a domed ceiling, the cake should be multi-tiered to make it higher and to complement the space.
Traditionally, formal wedding cakes are round, though square is also accepted for formal occasions. They are structured by adding paste, fondant, meringue or sugar decorations such as patterns, beads, flowers, birds, or ribbons.
White or ivory are the most traditional colors used for the icing or frosting on a wedding cake. However, formal colors can include brown, light blue, primrose yellow, and pink as well. Many couples choose the color of the cake to match the bride's gown, or the theme colors of the wedding.
Look at photos of formal wedding cakes to get an idea of the type of decorations that are possible.

, Ask to see some photos of their formal wedding cakes and taste some of their samples. If you like their work, discuss whether they can make a formal wedding cake to your specifications.

Tell your baker how many guests will be attending the wedding. This will define the size of the cake, as well as how many tiers it should have.
Make sure the price of your wedding cake fits your budget. If it's too expensive, get some quotes from other wedding bakers, or ask how you can adjust your current order to make it more affordable.

, Any arrangements, such as floral arrangements, should complement the cake, not draw attention away from it. Be careful with candles, as they can cause the frosting on the cake to melt."

Choose a quote you can build on.,
Quote only what you need.,
Make sure you know the context of the quote.,
Limit the use of quotes.",How to Choose a Quote to Use in a Wedding Toast1," Quotes often appear at the beginning of a toast. If you choose this route, find something that will easily flow into the rest of your toast. Don't quote a famous poem just because the couple likes the poet. Use a quote that introduces the more personal content of your toast.You could open your toast by saying something like:


The playwright Sophocles once said, “One word frees us all from the weight and pain of life. That word is love.” Billy met Jane a few weeks after losing his dad. Almost overnight, the grief that had weighed him down started to vanish.;
, Narrow a poem or a song down to a line or two. If your heart is set on a long quote from a novel or movie, leave out unnecessary words and sentences. Place an ellipsis (three periods) between two words or sentences that don't appear right next to each other in the quote.For example, if you wanted to use a long quote from a TV show, you could say:


In an episode of “Friends,” Phoebe tells Ross that Rachel is his lobster. When he gets confused, she explains, “...lobsters fall in love and mate for life. …You can actually see old lobster couples walking around their tank...holding claws.”

, When you hit the search engine, you'll find tons of quotes standing on their own. If you're drawn to something that's brand new to you, research it more thoroughly to make sure it's not an expression of sarcasm or irony. This way, you won't ruin the moment when you're making your toast., A good quote or two can help drive home the point you're trying to make. However, the toast is really about what you have to say, as opposed to what the original speaker said. Keep your toast original by choosing no more than two quotes."
"
Decide what mood you want to set.,
Find a quote that fits your theme.,
Keep it clean.",How to Choose a Quote to Use in a Wedding Toast2," Figure out if you want your toast to be funny, sentimental, or serious. The tone of your speech can make a big difference in the kind of quote you select. A funny quote might come from a novel or a movie, while a sentimental quote might come from song or poem., Have at least a general idea of the theme you want your toast to convey before you select a quote. This will help you narrow your search by topic rather than sifting through quotes randomly. Choose something that shapes the point you're trying to make., The wedding party is more than just you and your friends. You'll also be addressing the people you've never met, including children. Avoid any quotes that involve swear words or references to sex. Narrow your short list to quotes you'd feel comfortable reciting in front of your grandparents."
"
Include the couple's favorite movie or song.,
Identify a quote by someone important to the couple.,
Pick something that links you to the couple.",How to Choose a Quote to Use in a Wedding Toast3," Maybe you know how their favorite movie relates to “their song.” Choose a quote you know they'll identify with. It makes your toast even more personalized and shows you pay attention.For example, for a couple who likes the movie Notting Hill and the song “Ain't No Mountain High Enough,” you could say:


Like William and Anna, our happy couple drifted in and out of each other's lives before finally making a commitment. It's as if there “ain't no mountain high enough / ...no valley low enough / ...no river wide enough” to keep them apart.

, A quote doesn't have to come from somebody famous. Think of a quip from another friend or relative. Maybe one partner's grandparent has a few popular sayings that fit the theme. Perhaps something the happy couple says to each other might be perfect for your toast.You could try: something like:


Jenny's grandmother always says, “True love is like the universe. It's beautiful, endless, and always has something new to teach us.” I can see those words come alive when I look at Jenny and Susie. After 10 years together, they still keep their relationship vibrant with regular pleasant surprises.

, Think of a moment that you shared with half the couple. Maybe you found a quote in a college literature assignment that made you laugh. If that doesn't work, consider a quote that reminds you of the couple.You could say:


There's a famous scene in Shakespeare's play Much Ado About Nothing when Benedick blurts out to Beatrice, “I love nothing in the world so well as you.” Every time I read that scene, I think of Bob and Johnny.

Consider whether there are any specific dates that are special to you and your significant other.,
Plan around your honeymoon, if you plan to take one.,
Pick the season or the month in which you'd like to get married.,
Consider the day of the week.,
Decide whether you want to be married indoors or outdoors.,
Research the weather.,
Think about how long you'd like to be engaged.,
Consider the budget.,
Ask yourself a few questions before you set the date:


Are you and your fiancee able to take the time off work?,
Compromise with your fiancee.,
Consider your guests.,
Think about how far away guests will be coming from.,
Choose wisely.,
Choose the venue.,
Set the date.,
Make reservations.,
Finalize the guest list.,
Send out the invitations.",How to Choose a Wedding Date," Many wedding dates are related to a special day, like a birthday, the first day that you met, your first date to the movies, or the first time you kissed. If you really want a specific date, begin planning and calling around to venues and vendors you want to hire as early as possible. Wedding dates can be booked at least a year to several years in advance depending on the demand at a particular venue.


For example, perhaps your dating anniversary date falls on a Saturday in June. Consider choosing that date so that your wedding date will always be the same as your dating anniversary.
If you are pregnant, think about whether you want the wedding before or after the baby is born. Bear in mind that a late or early baby could throw a massive wrench into your works—so plan your wedding at least a few weeks (or months) before or after the baby is due.;
, If you know that you want to take your honeymoon in a specific place during a specific season, it may behoove you to pick a wedding date that fits with those plans. For example: if you are set upon a honeymoon in Thailand, you probably don't want to go during the monsoon season, from July to October — so you might plan a spring wedding.

, If you are not too picky about a certain date, then begin to think about your favorite times of the year. Is there any month or season in which you would like to get married? The time of the year can affect your venue, wedding colors, theme, and even the menu, so it is an important first step. Once you've decided on spring, summer, fall, or winter, you can narrow it down to a certain month.There are roughly three months in each season, so after you've decided on a season, pick the month in which you would prefer to get married. Do you want to get married toward the beginning of the season, or the end of the season? Consider the weather, holidays, and commitments you have in each month. Pick the one with the least conflict, and that best fits your specifications.
Look at your schedule for the month. Do you have any prior commitments, important or inescapable conflicts? First and foremost, eliminate any days where the two of you will be busy or unavailable.

, Saturday is the most popular day to get married, and consequently it usually the most expensive time slot. Depending on the venue, you may need to pay a premium to reserve a spot on a Saturday. Many couples are choosing to marry on off-days: Fridays, Sundays, or even midweek. Being flexible about the day of the week can make your wedding much cheaper than it would be otherwise., If you want to get married outdoors, it is especially important to consider the season. Think about the gown. If the bride has a dream gown in mind, it might not be appropriate for certain weather. For example, a velvet gown with fur trimming and long sleeves would make a hot summer wedding uncomfortable, as would a gauzy short-sleeved or sleeveless gown in the coldest part of winter.

, Once you pick a season or a certain month, begin researching what the weather is like in the location you are planning on getting married. Pay close attention to the weather seasons in the location of your wedding, like tornado or hurricane season. Tropical storms can really mess up your dream beach wedding if you haven't considered picking a date outside of the peak storm season.


The Farmer's Almanac is not exact, but it can be a helpful tool and also give you historical data on temperatures, rainfall, etc. for dates throughout history.Most weather-forecast websites also log data regarding average temperature and rainfall for a given area.

, Weigh this against how much time you think you'll need to plan your wedding. If you got engaged during the spring and your ideal wedding season is also the spring, you’ll likely be engaged for about a year. However, if you’re hoping to celebrate your wedding day within six months, you will be planning a fall or winter wedding. Know what’s most important to you and your fiance. You may need to compromise on the time or the season if the length of the engagement is the most important thing., It's generally more expensive to get married in the summer than in any other season. June, August, and September are the most popular marriage months. Some locations—especially touristy destinations—may be busier, and thus pricier, during certain times of year. Consider how you are financing the wedding: are you and your fiancee paying for it all yourselves, or are your parents helping out?You do not necessarily need to compromise by getting married on the cheap on a snowy Wednesday in December. You may just need to plan far in advance and save up your money to make your dream wedding happen.
Renting cars, hotels, and flights are extremely expensive on a holiday weekend. If you have friends or family coming from far away or out of the country, be aware pricey flights may prevent them from being able to come.

,
Have you left enough time to organize everything?
Do your family and friends already have any important commitments?
Is your chosen venue free on a given day? If not: is the date more important, or the venue?

, Talk to your partner, find out which season they like best, and compromise from there. The wedding is about the bride and the groom, not just one or the other. Both parties involved need to enjoy the occasion to ensure happy memories.


If he likes winter and you like summer, you might compromise for either spring or fall. Consider conceding to have the wedding in the winter, but agreeing that you get to choose the location. Perhaps there is a location that is warmer than average in the winter or colder than average in the summer.
If you want an outdoor ceremony and he wants it in a church, opt to have the ceremony in the church, but have the celebration afterwards in the church garden or other outdoor venue that you like.

, Do they have any commitments or conflicts that will rule out certain weekends? Naturally, the date you choose won't be perfect for everyone. At the very least, be sure that all of your immediate family and other important ""VIPs"" will be available to attend. If any important people cannot make it on certain days, consider ruling out those times.If you want to book your wedding near or on a major holiday, take into consideration that people might find it difficult to come to your wedding. For example if you want a wedding near Christmas, lots of people will already have made commitments. If all of your friends are into football, try not to set your wedding on Superbowl Sunday and make them choose.Consider the cultures of your guests. Some religions have certain days during which they are required to fast (Ash Wednesday and Good Friday for Catholics or Ramadan for Muslims, for example). If you know you will be having guests with required fast days, having your wedding on one of these fasting days will make your guests feel alienated.

, Keep work schedules in mind, and make sure to give your far-away family and friends plenty of advance notice to make travel plans and take off work. If guests will be coming from out of town, or if you are having a destination wedding that requires guests to travel, you are effectively the host — so it is important that you consider how everyone will get there. This is especially true for international weddings, as passports can take weeks to arrive.

, Remember is that this is the date on which you will celebrate your anniversary with your significant other for the rest of your lives. It needs to be memorable, but also make sense for the both of you — not only for what you want on the day of your wedding, but for years to come. If you get married on a holiday, for instance, your anniversary may be forever overshadowed by the festivities of that holiday.

, Find a day when it is available. The sooner, the better, so that you know you have the place you really want. Check out the spaces offered, the catering deals, the marriage fees, the ability to decorate a church or synagogue, wedding space, etc. Research into venues for the wedding and reception usually starts around the 12 months-to-go mark, with bookings occurring within the month once you've made up your mind.


Find out whether the prices quoted cover everything or whether you'll be expected to pay for extras. Be aware that even church and synagogue venues may charge fees.
Choose a place that fits the date you've chosen. If you've decided to get married in November, you probably don't want to get married in a place that gets a lot of rain and snow that time of year—unless you and your fiancee are into skiing. If you've decided to get married in July, consider whether you want an outdoor wedding or an indoor wedding.

, After you've narrowed down the available times and made sure that your venue is available, you are able to pick the date! Make the reservations to set everything into stone, then write up some invitations and start inviting the special people in your life.

, Now that you know the date of your wedding, you can use it make reservations and set all of the arrangements into stone. Setting the date usually occurs at the same time you've confirmed the place of the wedding and the place of the reception. Start booking caterers, photographers, and other services. High-demand wedding photographers are often booked months in advance, and you want to make sure that you're prepared ahead of time.

, Try to finalize the guest list by the time there are about seven months to go. Do expect some cancellations and possibly some last-minute additions due to illness, pregnancy, overseas travel, etc. It often can't be helped, so go with the flow.

, Send out ""save the date"" cards to your guests so that they have plenty of time to plan to be there. Once the venue and guest lists are confirmed, let everyone know what's coming up. Send emails if you know people will read them; otherwise, send cards to their postal addresses. Tell friends and family so they don't agree to go somewhere else and then not be able to come.

Choose a topper that represent how you met your fiancé.,
Top your cake with heirlooms.,
Represent your roots with your topper.,
Use a topper that represents where the proposal took place.",How to Choose a Unique Wedding Cake Topper1," On top of being unique, this can also be a romantic way of remembering how you and your significant other met. You can use an item from that day as a reminder of it, or you might want to print a high-quality picture of the place you met, attach this to a skewer, and use that as the topper instead.


When using a high-quality picture, you may want to use Photoshop to add a little message or explain the topper. Something as simple as “Where we met, and now, together forever” can make your choice in topper more obvious to guests.;
, This can be a nice way of remembering a family member who’s passed on or a family tradition. Beyond these reasons, heirlooms are often ornate, which means they won’t look out of place topping your cake.Be sure you clean these thoroughly before using them as a topper. If you plan on using jewelry, you may want to have the piece cleaned by a jeweler first.
Some heirlooms might be able to nest right on top of the cake. However, in some cases you may need to attach the item to skewers to make it more visible.

, If you have a close connection with your home state, or if you and your partner are from different states, this can be a fun way of remembering your roots. Make cut outs of your home states, mark your home town with a star, and complete the topper with your initials written somewhere on each cut out.These toppers can be made easily with high-quality paper and then attached to the cake with skewers or toothpicks.
You may want to use card stock or some kind of rigid paper for this topper idea. Otherwise, the paper might not stay upright.

, If you or your fiancé planned an extravagant proposal, you may remember this event fondly. Use a memento from that day as a topper, print out a picture of the location the proposal happened, or use a picture of the proposal itself.


If a friend or onlooker caught your proposal on film, you can use this image to commemorate the day you were engaged.

Read through the contract.",How to Choose a Wedding Car Hire," Work out the number of bridesmaids, groomsmen, flower girls and pageboys that you will be having. Each person entitled to travel as your wedding party may also want you to arrange their transportation, so be clear about this in advance.


Knowing who needs to go in the wedding party car(s) will help you to decide how many cars need booking. If you require two or more cars, or a larger vehicle to get the whole wedding party to the areas you're going, organized appropriately and on time, then you need to know this now.;
, How many trips will the wedding party make through the day? Is the travel distance short or long? If it's longer than a quarter of an hour, comfort will be a very important factor. At all times, safety is a priority too.


Think about timing and be practical. Choose the journey ahead of schedule. A few ladies like to take a scenic route before the ceremony. In other words, they like to be fashionably late.
Also, after the service the bride and groom may like to get some photos taken at various spots.

, When deciding on your route and additional trips, consider what you need and allow plenty of time for everything.

, This may be a company with a lot of staff or it might be an owner-driver company who is well-known for having a very special car. Whoever you choose, they must have a good reputation and be known for their reliability.


Look for a company that has been established in the wedding car hire business for many years.
Ask for references from people who have used the wedding car/owner-driver business before. Or, check online for feedback.
Choose a firm who knows the area in which the wedding is taking place well. Ask if the drivers have GPS.
Make sure the chauffeurs follow a timetable. Good companies will know to check ahead for any disturbance on the streets or if there any arrangements for roadwork that may cause delays.

Do you like all things vintage? Then maybe a vintage car is a good choice.
Do you like traditional things? Then an exemplary Rolls Royce Silver Cloud, Bentley or Jaguar may be the best choice.
Do you like to live fast and racy? Perhaps a racing car or a car known for speed is your style.
Do you like making a bold statement? Maybe a stretch Hummer or a hotted up streetcar is more to your tastes?
Do you like modern and minimal? Choose a standard, modern and well accessorized car that is reliable and neat.
Do you like quirky? There might be unusual vehicles that are available for you to use. These might not be available through the usual wedding car specialists though, so keep that in mind when choosing a vehicle that is somewhat out of the ordinary.

, Hire companies vary in standards. The cars can differ enormously in their condition. Find out if the cars are garaged; if they are, it is likely that they will be of a higher standard and better kept up.


Good limo companies will have a showroom and will welcome you to view the cars at appointed times.
You may also be able to see the relevant cars at various wedding expos, if you're able to attend such events.

, As with the car's shade and style, you will likewise need to consider the size of the wedding car with respect to your dress. If you intend on having a large dress, or long train, then select a car that is suitable. Squashing into a small car will crease the dress or train and may well spoil the day for you.

Hence, it is important that you book your wedding auto well ahead of time, conceivably 12 months to a year and a half ahead, or when you have set the date for your wedding day.

, A few firms just have one or two autos and will attempt to profit as much as they can during the wedding season. They might likewise need to leave for an alternate wedding at a certain hour, which could upend your plans and prevent last-minute essential changes. Ensure that exclusivity is written into your car hire agreement.

, When booking, ensure that you have a clear contract/ wedding agreement that outlines the journey, hire period, type of car and what is expected on the day. If you don't understand the terms, ask for clarification. Better still, bring along someone who is familiar with contracts and is willing to read through it for you, such as a business person, a legal officer or someone who likes fine print and details."

Board game pieces for avid board gamers.
Model cars for gearheads and car lovers.
Figurines or miniature versions of sports items/players., You and your partner may share a favorite animal, or you both may have different favorite animal.

Think about cowboy accessories.,

Add some rustic jewelry.",How to Choose a Rustic Wedding Dress," Longer dresses tend to give off a country vibe. Look for dresses that are longer cut. You can have a dress that flows down to your feet or a dress that goes past your knees. Choose a long dress without a lot of beads, lace, or other embellishments, as this gives off the simple, rustic feel.If your footwear is important for your big day, choose a dress that shows off your shoes. If you plan on wearing, say, cowboy boots, do not wear a dress that covers your feet.;
, Embroidery can make your dress look more rural. If you want something fancy, but do not want to go overboard with embellishments, an embroidered gown may work for you.Embroidery can be great if you want a splash of color. Some gowns have small embroidered designs in colorful shades like red and blue.

, Ribbons are a great addition to a wedding dress. However, very fancy ribbon patterns may kill the rustic vibe. Instead of opting for perfectly positioned ribbons, look for dresses that have ribbons strung in asymmetrical patterns throughout your dress. This can add some decoration to your gown while keeping the country vibe intact., Long, flowing sleeves can give off a country girl feel that's perfect for a rustic wedding. Look for a gown with longer sleeves that are a little puffier than average.However, there are no hard and fast rules for what constitutes a rustic dress. If you have your heart set on sleeveless, your dress can still be rustic if you keep it on the longer side and minimize embellishments.

, If you want to give off a rustic feel on your wedding day, make sure you wear rustic shoes. Instead of fancy footwear with lace and sparkles, go for played down shoes made from simple materials.If you want a really simple look, go for a simple pair of laced brown shoes made out of a material like suede or leather.
If you want heels, find a way to give heels a rustic vibe. Have bows attached made from burlap fabric or pick a duller color, like dark gold, instead of a sparkly, vibrant shade.
Shoes with a crocheted pattern can also give off a rustic vibe. Consider getting a pair of white flats with a nice crocheted pattern.

, A long, lacy veil helps give your wedding a rustic feel. You should also minimize embellishments. A veil with a lot of beads or ribbons may not exemplify the simple, rustic vibe., Instead of using a flashy headband or hairpiece to hold up your veil, use a floral crown. A floral crown will help give off the nature vibe a rustic wedding needs.Use flowers that are native to your area in your floral crown. This will make it look like you picked the flowers for the crown yourself, contributing to the no frills feel of a rustic wedding.

, The cowboy look is one way to give your outfit a rustic feel. Cowboy boots can help give off a rustic vibe, as well as cowboy hats and jackets.You can go for shorter cowboy boots, that do not reach your knees, or knee-high boots. Take your dress's length into account when choosing boots. Pick boots that will be easy to see while you wear your dress.
Wear a denim jacket over your dress. This can work well for sleeveless dresses, especially if you're having an outdoor wedding on a chilly day.Try wearing a cowboy hat in place of a veil if you want a cowboy look.
If you want to add a little color to your outfit, use your boots, hats, or jacket to do so. You can, for example, wear blue boots to add the ""something blue"" to your wedding day theme.

, A hat can be a great accessory for your wedding day, especially if you're forgoing a veil. To pick a rustic hat, go for small hat with a tiny brim in a neutral color like white. A hat with a small embellishment, like a tiny ribbon, can add some extra decoration without killing the rustic vibe., A shawl can give off a county feel that's perfect for a rustic wedding. If you don't mind throwing something over your wedding dress, consider wearing a knit shawl over your shoulders. If you want something a big more intricate, you can try a crocheted shawl.A shawl can be a good way to add color to your outfit. If you're looking for ""something blue"", for example, wear a blue shawl.

, If you're carrying a bouquet down the aisle, opt for wild flowers. This will give off a rustic vibe as the bouquet will look like it's taken straight out of nature. This is fitting with the simple feel of a rustic wedding.Do not go with elaborate patterns for your bouquet. Simply bundle the flowers together in a casual, somewhat haphazard arrangement to keep things looking rustic.

, Use your jewelry to help showcase your wedding's rustic vibe. Jewelry that's somewhat casual and clunky can help your wedding dress look more rustic.Wear thick bracelets made out of rural materials like wood.
Go for big, clunky earrings made out of casual materials like beads or feathers.
Wear beaded necklaces in bright colors like turquoise.

Try yellow gold for sensitive skin.,
Pick rose gold for durability.,
Choose silver for affordability.,
Mix and match.",How to Choose a Combined Engagement and Wedding Ring1," While rose gold is renowned for its durability, some people have allergic reactions to the copper in the metal. Therefore, if the bride has sensitive skin, it's best to shy away from rose gold and go for yellow gold., Of the traditional wedding and engagement ring metals, rose gold is the most durable. It's durable because of the addition of copper to the gold. Copper is a tough metal, making rose gold more durable overall.Another durable metal is platinum, which is much harder and stronger than any gold. However, because it is so rare, it is more expensive than other metals.Rose gold is also a great choice for a vintage look.

, Silver is one of the more affordable metals when it comes to wedding sets. However, it's not as common as gold or platinum. Like gold, it is fairly soft, so it is mixed with other metals for durability.White gold, while more expensive than silver, gives you the look of platinum at a more affordable price.

, While many combination engagement and wedding rings are in the same metal, they don't have to be. In fact, with the layering trend, mismatched metals on your wedding and engagement bands is trendy."

Decide how it will be worn.,
Balance the set.,
Customize the set.,
Choose smaller bands to let the diamonds shine.",How to Choose a Combined Engagement and Wedding Ring2," Some brides prefer to wear just the wedding band after they're married, while others wear both the engagement band and the wedding band. If the bride wants to wear them together, consider getting bands that lock into one another. They will be easier to wear, and they will coordinate well., Having a big flashy engagement ring and a big flashy wedding band can be a little too much together. Consider showing off one or the other, and letting the other ring be a bit simpler.For instance, you might have an engagement ring set with a series of diamonds and then have a plain wedding band.
In addition, not getting stones on both bands will save you money.

, While some sets come ready-made, you also have the option of customizing some sets. For example, you may get to choose what stone goes in the engagement ring, which is a way of adding a personal touch to the process.For example, you may want a certain cut of diamond, or you may decide that you don't want diamonds at all.

, A small band, particularly on the engagement ring, will make the diamond or other stone look bigger. Similarly, a small wedding band will help keep the attention on the large stone of the engagement ring.In addition, using smaller bands means less metal, making them cheaper.

Pick a solitary setting to make it shine.,
Choose a bezel setting for wear and tear.,
Consider a pave or channel setting for extra sparkle.,
Try a tension ring setting for security.,
Go simple for active lifestyles.,
Pick a stone that fits your style.",How to Choose a Combined Engagement and Wedding Ring3," If you want a simple design, pick a set that only has one stone, the diamond on the engagement ring. Doing so will allow that stone to shine. A prongs setting (small metal pieces holding the stone in place) are a good option for this type of setup, as they let light through the stone., If the bride plans to wear the set regularly (as opposed to just the wedding band), a bezel setting may be best. It protects the stone better than many other settings, make it ideal for everyday wear.In a bezel, the stone sits down in the metal, and it is kept in place by a metal rim around the top.

, If the bride is all about the sparkle, then these settings are ideal. They allow small diamonds or other stones to be set around the ring, creating a very sparkly effect.In a channel setting, the stones float in a small groove, held in place by the top rim. In the pave setting, the stones are set in small holes with prongs, and the stones are set right next to one another.
However, to make it easier to resize later, consider only going halfway around the ring.

, If you are worried about losing the stone, one of the most secure settings is actually the tension setting. As the ring comes around to the front, it splits around the diamond. Each side of the ring holds an edge of the diamond, and the tension of the ring keeps in place. In addition, this setting allows for most of the diamond to be seen., You may want to choose a simple wedding band for everyday wear, particularly if your work demands it. For instance, if you need to wear latex gloves because you're a nurse, doctor, or vet, you may want just a simple band. Similarly, if you have your hands in food all the time (such as a baker), you may also want something simple to wear everyday. Stones can catch on gloves, and if you have your hands in food, it can become embedded in the setting.

, Of course, diamonds are the obvious choice for wedding and engagement rings. However, you don't need to stick with diamonds if that's not your style. You can try any stone you'd like, or even just pick a colorful diamond rather than the standard. It all comes down to what you love.


You can also mix stones. You can have a diamond in the center of the engagement ring, flanked by two other stones of your choice, such as sapphires.Also, you may find that other stones are cheaper than diamonds.

Choose subtle lighting.",How to Choose a Hanging Centerpiece for Your Wedding," Though it may not be the first thing to come mind, your budget is one of the most important aspects of your choosing your centerpiece. Sit down with your significant other and whoever else may be involved in the budgeting of your wedding and agree on a price range for your centerpieces.The size of your wedding is an important consideration. If you are having a large wedding and you are having centerpieces above each table, you will need to purchase more centerpieces, whereas if you are having a smaller, more intimate wedding, you can allot a smaller amount of your wedding budget to the centerpiece.
There are several ways that you can save money on your centerpieces. The more flowers you use, the more expensive your centerpieces will be. To save money, you may decide to have a light or candle-centered centerpiece, or a more sculptural centerpiece.;
, Once you decide on a budget for your centerpiece, look through bridal catalogs and the Internet to start gathering inspiration. Cut or print out pictures of hanging centerpieces that appeal to you and create a mood board of centerpieces that you like.You can create a physical mood board for your centerpiece or use a website like Pinterest to organize your ideas virtually.
At this point, don’t worry about the prices of the individual centerpieces that you see pictures of. This process is more about discovering what colors, textures and types of flowers appeal to you.
It’s ok if you are attracted to very different kinds of centerpieces. Once you take into account details about your wedding such as venue, style and general color scheme, you will be able to pinpoint what kind of centerpieces would or would not work for your individual wedding.
The only thing that you should try to decide as you gather inspiration is if you want a floral centerpiece, a non-floral centerpiece, or a mix of floral and non-floral elements.
Floral centerpieces work well for classic, traditional-style weddings, whereas light-based or sculptural centerpieces are great for outdoor weddings or weddings with a more modern style.

, Begin your search for florists or wedding designers early, ideally about 10-11 months in advance. Begin by doing an Internet search of florists or designers in your town or city. Visit their websites, look at pictures and read reviews of their work.If you want a floral-based centerpiece, look at florists or floral designers who specialize in weddings. If you are more interested in light-based designs or sculptural designs, find a floral designer that works other materials, or a wedding designer who has experience making hanging centerpieces.
Researching florists or designers and looking at their work not only can help you choose what florist you want to use, it can also give you the ideas and inspiration you need to help you know what you want.

, Researching different florists and wedding designers in your city should have helped you get closer to reaching a decision about who you want to go with. Narrow your options down to a few designers, then set up a meeting with each one you are interested in.


When you meet with the florists or designers, tell them about your vision for your wedding as well as your budget. Ask the florists to give you a more focused price estimate, and ask them to show you samples of their work.
Take your own budget and the work of each florist into consideration to make your final decision about which florist you want to use to make your final centerpiece or centerpieces.

, Once you have made your decision, meet with your florist or wedding designer to talk about your ideas and to get input. Bring the mood board you created, along with any items that may give you some kind of inspiration.Give your designer the details of your wedding, including the kind of venue at which is taking place, the size of the wedding, the colors of the bridesmaids dresses along with the other colors that you envision being the most prominent in the space of the reception.
Show your designer your mood board and tell them about any ideas that you may have at this stage. Then pick out a centerpiece with the help of your florist by both matching the arrangement with the rest of your wedding and taking into mind what arrangements are practical in terms of your wedding.

, Hanging floral centerpieces are lavish and beautiful arrangements that help to give your wedding a classic feel. To choose the right centerpiece for your wedding, think about the various aspects of your wedding, including the type of venue, the level of formality, and the style of your dress. A good place to start is to think of adjectives that could describe the aesthetics of your wedding, such as “classic”, “rustic”, “minimalist” or “colorful.” Use these adjectives as jumping off points to find the right hanging centerpiece.A “classic” style floral centerpiece often features white, neutral or pink colored flowers, with classic flowers like roses, baby’s breath or tulips hanging in a symmetrical formation. You may choose this kind of centerpiece if you want the feel of a traditional, church-style wedding and you are going for a feminine and romantic look.
A “rustic” style wedding centerpiece could feature hanging pots or large hanging arrangements of bright wildflowers, mixed textures, and containers like large metals tins or wicker baskets. This type of centerpiece is great if you are having an outdoor wedding or having your reception in a setting like a garden or vineyard.
A “glamorous” wedding centerpiece may have a large group of cascading blooms, and also may contain lavish details like crystal embellishments or feathers. A glamorous wedding centerpiece is best for very fancy weddings and receptions held in historic settings.
A “modern” wedding centerpiece may feature minimalistic arrangements of flowers or greenery, suspended in square or geometric containers, or in wreaths or hoops. This kind of centerpiece gives your wedding a chic and sophisticated feel.

, A good way to narrow down your flower choices is to consider the season of your wedding. If you are having a summer or spring wedding, you may want to use pastel-colored or brightly colored blooms.During fall, you may choose to use deeply colored flowers in crimson or purple along with white or neutral flowers.
Match the season during winter by using evergreens and neutral-colored flowers, and by incorporating candles into your centerpiece.
You may also want to check with your florist about flowers that may or may not be in season during the month of your wedding.
As long as the flowers are available, don’t feel restricted by the season in terms of the flowers you want to use. Though some future brides and grooms like to take cues from the season, it’s not necessary to do so.

, Check with the venue of your wedding reception to see whether you will be able to hang arrangements from the ceiling. If you are hosting your wedding outside or in a place with an extremely high ceiling, make sure that your florist knows the limitations of the space.


If you don’t have a ceiling from which to hang the centerpiece, it doesn’t mean you can’t have a hanging-style centerpiece. You may need to ask your florist or wedding designer about purchasing a standing structure that goes around the each table or in the middle of the room, from the top of which you can suspend a floral arrangement. Keep in mind that this is best for more casual or rustic-style weddings., Consider the overall color scheme of your wedding, including any other flowers you are using, the color of the bridesmaids’ dresses, and the color of the table linens that the centerpieces will be presented over.


You don’t need to exactly match the centerpiece to any of these colors, as long as you use colors that compliment each other. For instance, you may choose to have pastel blooms in your centerpiece if your wedding features other pastel colors. If you have a fall theme for your wedding, you may choose to have a centerpiece that has deep, dark colors along with white or off-white flowers.
Don’t use only one color throughout your wedding. It’s best to use a few colors that harmonize with each other rather than only one color. Using colors that compliment each other helps to bring out each color’s beauty and makes for more interesting visuals.

, If you are hiring a floral designer, you are likely hiring the same florist to do some of the other flowers arrangements at your wedding. Think about how the flowers of your centerpiece may fit in with the other flowers that you will have, and choose flowers for your centerpiece that match or compliment those other flowers in terms color or type of flower., When deciding on what kinds of flowers you want for your centerpiece, remember that the centerpieces will be directly above your guests for several hours. Use lightly scented or unscented flowers to make sure that none of your guests get an allergic reaction from your arrangements!, The last thing you want to worry about on your wedding day is wilting flowers. Stay away from high maintenance flowers like hydrangeas that need constant hydration and don’t last long out of water. Ask your florist for their advice on which types of flowers to use.

, Just as with floral centerpieces, it’s important that the light-based or sculptural centerpiece you use matches the style of your wedding.A “classic” style non-floral centerpiece may feature an ornate silver, gold or crystal chandelier, which enhances your wedding’s elegant feel. You can incorporate a floral element by adding garlands of flowers that twist around the arms of the chandelier.
A “rustic” or “edgy” style centerpiece could feature a canopy of string lights, or a “chandelier” of mismatched lighting including paper lanterns, Edison bulbs and lights in jars. This gives your centerpiece a unique and hand-crafted feel.
An “artsy” style centerpiece could be made of intricately cut paper, ornate pompom style sculptures, or even classy, metallic balloon letters in words like “love” or “forever.”
A “modern” style centerpiece can feature a chandelier of lights in geometric jars or containers, or “curtains” of hanging lights., Check with the venue that you are using for your reception to see what kind of supports you need for your centerpiece. This is especially important for string lights canopies, which will need to be affixed in several places and may need to be hooked up to electricity. You may have the option of hanging pieces from trees if you are having an outdoor wedding or erecting standing supports that will allow you to hang your centerpiece

, If you want a light-based centerpiece, make sure that the light is soft and pleasant, as opposed to overly bright. Choose bulbs that give off a warm glow, and assess the centerpiece together with what you know about the lighting of the venue to make sure that the room isn’t too dim or too bright.


If you are using colored lights for a modern, artsy effect, use colors that flatter skin tones such as pinks and purples."

Decide how bold a statement you want to make with metallics.,
Consider your color palette.,
Soften the metallic decorations with contrasting materials.,
Choose metallic vases.,
Tie off the flower arrangements with metallic ribbon.,
Gild some of the leaves in your arrangements.,
Cover the tables and chairs with sequined cloths.,
Add metal candlesticks to the tables.,
Go gold with the place settings.,
Work a metallic layer into your cake.,
Incorporate metallic lanterns at an outdoor wedding.,
Opt for metallic guest cards.",How to Use Metallics in Your Wedding Decorations," In most cases, metallics work best as small accents in your wedding decor. However, you can use larger splashes of metallics to make a bolder statement. Keep in mind that your decor will have a more dramatic look, though, so a heavy dose of metallics is more suited for a formal or evening wedding.If you want to go heavy with metallics in your decorations, it’s best to pair them with a neutral color palette. A subdued color scheme allows the metallics to pop and keeps the decor from being over the top. Pair a large number of metallic decorations with white, black, gray, navy, beige, taupe, and/or brown shades.;
, When you’re using metallic decorations for your wedding, it’s important to make sure that they coordinate with the color palette that you’ve chosen. Warm shades, such as reds, oranges, and yellows, usually look best with gold metallic decorations, while cool shades, such blues, greens, and purples, typically work best with silver metallic decorations.Bronze, copper, and rose gold metallic decorations can also complement a warm color palette.
Stainless steel or aluminum decorations can also complement a cool color palette.

, If you’re planning to use metallic decorations at your wedding, think about the fabrics and materials that you’ll be pairing with them. To keep the metallics from looking too harsh, choose soft or rich fabrics to help create balance in the decor.For example, you might line the walls of the venue with gauzy curtains or fabrics panels and pair them with metallic accents.
Velvet tablecloths paired with metallic centerpieces can work well for a winter wedding.
Lace and satin decor can also help soften the look of metallic decorations.

, If you want to add a subtle metallic touch to your wedding decor, consider using metallic vases for your floral arrangements. Pair gold, silver, bronze, or copper vases with simple white or pale pink, yellow, or blue flowers to dress up the tables at your wedding.You can purchase or rent metallic vases for the big day. However, if you’re on a budget, you can make them yourself. Use metallic spray paint to paint inexpensive vases, mason jars, wine bottles, or other glass items that would work as vases.

, If you’re adorning the pews or aisle markers at the wedding venue with flowers, you can work metallics into those arrangements as well. Use metallic ribbon to hold the flowers together for another subtle pop of gold, silver, bronze, or copper. For a more dramatic look, tie the ribbon off in large bows so it really stands out amongst the flowers.You can also use metallic ribbon for the bouquets for the bride and bridesmaids. The groom and groomsmen can also incorporate metallic ribbon in their boutonnieres.

, For a subtle but unique metallic touch to your wedding’s floral arrangements, consider gilding some of the leaves. You can do it yourself or ask your florist to do it for you, but be sure to use camellia and/or magnolia leaves. They last for several days, so you can prepare the leaves ahead of time and have them ready for the wedding.To gild the leaves yourself, use a paintbrush to spread sizing glue, which is available at the craft store, on the tips of the leaves. Next, apply gold, silver, or bronze leaf to the leaves to give them a metallic edge.

, If you want to make a bold statement with metallics at your wedding, metallic sequined table cloths or seat covers can instantly brighten up the venue. You can also save the metallic sequins for just the happy couple’s chairs so they really stand out in the room.If all over sequins seem too much, look for table cloths or chair covers that feature a sequined polka dot design. It will still add shine to the venue without seeming over the top.

, Having candles as part of the table decor at your wedding helps create soft, romantic mood lighting. They also allow you to incorporate metallics into the tablescape by using gold, silver, bronze, or copper candlesticks to hold the candles.Create a striking tablescape by using candlesticks of various heights and widths.

, Silverware may be the traditional option for cutlery, but you can really dress up the place settings for your wedding by using gold instead. You can also mix up your place settings by using bronze or rose gold cutlery, which offers a softer look than gold.You’ll likely need to speak to the venue where you’re having the reception to discuss cutlery options. The venue may not have gold or other metallic cutlery available, so you’ll need to rent them from a party rental company.

, The cake is often the centerpiece of wedding decor, so don’t overlook the possibility of giving it a metallic edge. With edible gold or silver leaf, you can add a metallic layer to the cake -- or cover its entire exterior with a metallic finish so it really stands out.You can also use the metallic gold or silver leaf on fruit and other small pastries to dress up the dessert table.

, Lighting is often a concern at outdoor weddings, but it also presents an opportunity to work in some metallic accents to the decor. Use brass, bronze, or stainless steel lanterns to add light and ambiance to your outdoor wedding.You may even want to use some metallic lanterns at an indoor wedding to highlight certain areas. For example, hang one or more over the table where the happy couple is sitting to help draw attention to them.

, The guest or place cards are another opportunity to incorporate a subtle metallic touch to the decor. Use metallic font for your guests’ names an elegant bit of shine to the decor.To keep a theme throughout the wedding, you might use the same metallic font for the invitations.

, This is the next big thing, since planning your wedding reception will bring forth the biggest expense. When you go to rent the reception hall, you'll have to give a rounded figure of approximately how many guests you're likely to have. Therefore, an important part of any planning of the wedding reception involves pruning down your reception list; this will also bring about an estimation of the costs per head, according to the size of the room and your requirements too.

, Obviously, if want an outdoor event, you'll have to consider the possibility of rain ruining your plan, therefore, keep a hidden ace up your sleeve just in case.


The season is crucial, particularly if you're on a tight budget. Planning your wedding reception in winter, at the end of January for instance, will save money or earn you a discount.
In some cases, planning your wedding reception requires you choose between Saturday and Sunday as the most convenient days of the week; sometimes Sunday is less expensive.

, Nowadays the two main types of reception are sit-down meal or cocktail party, but other variants such as picnics, a simple cake-cutting, or a beach reception might also appeal. Here are some things to consider in relation to different reception types:



Sit-down: It's traditional, guests tend to really appreciate it and it works well for speeches. On the downside, it can feel stuffy and over-planned. It can also be the most expensive option.

Cocktail reception: It's hip and modern, and it's also enjoyed a lot by guests. It may cost a lot less than a sit-down, but it can suffer from feeling a bit disorganized and hard to gain the attention of guests for cake cutting and toasts.

Picnic: Great for nature-loving couples, and easy to arrange catering can be done using your local favorite sandwich place. Since it's outdoors, there can be a risk of rain and some people might find this too informal for a wedding.

Simple cake cutting: For those leaving the registry office, a simple affair of cutting a cake in the foyer, or in a local cafe or even at home might be enough to finish up the occasion with friends who have attended it. This tends to be suitable for very small parties and for people who really didn't want to have any reception fuss at all. Have tea, coffee, and few cookies or cupcakes as well.

Beach or yacht reception: Like a picnic, this is outdoors and risks a change of weather but it can be a lot of fun and make for beautiful photos. Again, it may be too informal for some and sand or water may definitely get everywhere!

, On the positive side, this can provide an opportunity to greet all guests and allows everyone to feel they've had the chance to congratulate you. On the downside, it can take a lot of time and it can begin to feel tiring for those on it. Some guests may also detest the formality of this and having to wait in line. Having divorced parents can also make this an awkward decision for some.


If you do have one, this is the order: Bride's mother or parents, groom's mother or parents, bride, groom, maid of honor, then bridesmaids.

, This can be a lot of fun and can be done simply and easily by the DJ or bandleader, saying something like ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome the newlyweds Bob and Billie (or Mr and Mrs)"", and you can then take your places for dinner.

, While these are both traditional and wonderful, they're a pain when they're too long, too maudlin, rude, or just plain dull. Make the toasts during or between dinner courses, with two or three people speaking each time.


Ask all toasters to keep it short and have someone in the wedding party time keep - and be strict about it too.
The bride and groom can speak just before cutting the cake.

, Nowadays most weddings tend to leave the dancing until all courses are finished rather than having dances between courses. Besides your special song, be sure to have songs people will really want to dance to, not strange songs that only suit the taste of a few.


Does the bride wish to dance with her father? You could have a father and daughter dance session included.

, You will want reception photos as much as the ceremony photos. Organize pictures with family and friends, in special groups or at certain tables.


Do you want guests to take photos too? They could each be asked to email digital photos of the evening that they've taken; give them a central wedding photo email set up just for this purpose.

, For example, you might wish to have the garter belt removal tradition in front of the guests. And you might wish to throw the flowers at your reception, as per tradition.

, If you're planning a sit-down dinner, seating can grow to be a bit of headache so it pays to focus on it early enough.


The bride and groom can sit at the dais or raised platform at whatever goes for being the ""front"" of the room. The bridal party sits with them and they all face the rest of the room. This is not as popular as it once was, as placing the table amid the guests is beginning to take on a more acceptable and modern feel.
Parents tend to be seated with other, or they can have respective family and friends at their tables.
Elderly people shouldn't be seated too near anything that makes noise.
Consider using place cards to help people know where they're going to sit. It's not essential but it can be very helpful. In doing this, take great pains to avoid seating people who don't get along next to one another!

, There will always be some people with dietary restrictions, so be prepared to provide vegetarian, gluten-free, and other variants as needed. It's a good idea to have asked guests in advance for advice concerning allergies. A cocktail reception will usually on have nibbles and finger foods but still have both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options available. Decide how many courses you want for a sit-down dinner and be sure to check this against your budget.


Sit-down dinners usually have menus printed up for them.
The method of food service needs to be decided - buffet style (help yourself) or serving at a table? There are also variants such as placing larger servings on the table for guests to help themselves from (family - or Russian service if the waiter holds the food), or plated (arrives at table already done), or French (waiters serve at the table), etc.

, Decide when it will be cut.


Do you want guests to share the cake as part of dessert or to take a piece home instead? Perhaps both?
Ensure that the photographer is organized to take a photo of you cutting the cake.

Decide on the basics with your fiance.,

Decide when the party’s over.,
Designate a wedding emcee or stage manager.,
Consider the venue’s rules or restrictions.",How to Plan Your Wedding Reception Exit1," Talk to your fiance about what kind of traditional and personal elements you'd like the reception to feature. Consult bridal or lifestyle magazines, either in print or online. Talk to your families about unique cultural traditions you might want to incorporate.Ask each other about how to organize cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing. Do you both want to include elements like cutting the cake, a first dance, bouquet and garter tosses, and a last dance? Do you both want a strict schedule of events, or should the reception be more about going with the flow?
Talk to each other about how important the exit is to you. Do both of you want to make a grand exit? Do you simply want a more relaxed, open-ended reception exit?;
, To ensure you have time to sort out all of the details, start planning your wedding and reception several months in advance. When planning your reception’s timeline, overestimate the amount of time it’ll take for the first dance, cake cutting, bouquet and garter tosses, and other portions of the event.Overestimating will ensure you have time for every activity without having to rush through anything.
Plan out the schedule, but be flexible. Don’t be upset if you have to deviate from the plan.

, Set a definite time to make your grand exit. Avoid having an indefinite end to the reception. Wedding receptions often feature lots of alcohol, and whether it’s open bar or not, a party that goes into the wee hours can be costly, put your guests at risk, and threaten your big day with drama.While you should set a time to make your exit, be prepared to make it earlier in the evening. For example, if your reception is on a Sunday night, your guests might start to leave before your scheduled exit. You’ll want to make your exit while you still have enough guests to give you a proper send-off.

, It’s vital to pick a person to keep an eye on the time, notice if people are preparing to leave earlier than planned, and handle all the logistics that you wouldn’t want to worry about on your big day. After all, you wouldn’t want to have to awkwardly announce your own exit to your guests.The emcee or stage manager can be a member of the wedding party, like the maid of honor or best man, or one of the newlywed couple’s parents. You can also choose the DJ, if you’ve hired one, to make any necessary announcements about the send-off.

, You or your wedding planner should check with your venue about all necessary details, from planning out the exit time to deciding what guests throw or wave when you exit. Ask the venue’s person of contact if there’s a time by which all guests must exit the building and if they allow throwing rice or confetti (or whatever material you have planned). If there’s no obvious grand staircase or other appropriate area for an exit, ask your contact if there’s a good spot they suggest.If everyone, from your guests to vendors, must be out at a certain time, be sure to give your vendors at least an hour to clean up and pack their equipment.
Sparklers are an increasingly popular send-off item, but some venues don’t allow them, even in outdoor areas. Double check with your venue’s person of contact if you’re planning on using sparklers.

Change into traveling clothes.,
Have your emcee or stage manager give you a five minute warning.,
Arrange your transportation.,
Announce the last song to guests and tell them what to do.,
Adapt your timeline if necessary.",How to Plan Your Wedding Reception Exit2," If you’re planning on starting your honeymoon immediately after the reception, be sure to change into clothes comfortable enough for traveling. Traditionally, couples changed into clothes for the plane ride before their big exit. In addition to the dramatic appeal of a costume change, newlyweds often change into outfits that are more suited to drinking, eating, and dancing., Your designated helper should quietly let you know when your exit time is approaching. This will give you a few minutes to give out hugs and personal goodbyes before your grand exit.Alternatively, they can let you know that people are getting tired, talking about leaving or having to get up early in the morning, and other reasons that would justify bumping up the exit time.

, Be sure that your limousine, cab, horse and carriage, or whatever means of transportation you’ve chosen is in position to pick you up after your exit. Have your emcee or stage manager give a signal to your driver to bring the car around or call a cab. Make sure this is done just before the five minute warning, or even earlier if necessary., Have the emcee or DJ make an announcement just before the last dance. They should offer instructions both before and after the dance.Have them say, “Good evening everyone! We’re about to have our last dance of the night. Immediately after, we’ll be sending off the newlyweds into married life! Please make your way to the front steps at the end of the song.” Have them tell guests whether they’ll be throwing or waving anything at the send-off.
After the song, have the emcee or DJ once again instruct guests to make their way to the exit area. Have your wedding party or other helpers hand out rice, confetti, white clothes, sparklers, or any other items that are part of your grand exit.

, While you make the most of your party, have your stage manager, wedding party, or other designated helpers keep an eye on the the crowd. Have them keep track of the tone, if guests are talking about leaving soon, and other causes to tweak your schedule. Proceed with any festivities left on the schedule, and have your helpers begin to prepare the send-off.Have them report to you if they hear that important guests or a significant number of people mention getting back to the babysitter, having to get up early for work, or other reasons for leaving soon. Your designated helpers should tell them, ""Don't worry, stick around a bit. The newlyweds will be making their exit soon."" Then, they should report to you and ask if you're ready to start to wind things down.
They should also keep an eye out for rowdy guests. If too many people have taken advantage of the bar, they should ask the bartender about cutting people off, politely handle any issues, and inform you that it might be time for people to move on to the bars if they wish to continue the party. Both you and the venue should help arrange any necessary transportation to prevent your guests from drinking and driving.
Remember that you've most likely rented out your venue for a specific amount of time, so try not to cut festivities too short unless it's necessary. If you still have two hours of rental time left, it might be better to take full advantage of your investment rather than worry about having a maximum number of guests send you off.

Choose a meaningful song for the last dance.,
Include family or cultural traditions.,
Choose a memorable way for guests to send you off.,
Make it your own.",How to Plan Your Wedding Reception Exit3," The easiest way to add a personal touch is through your song choices. Check online for lists of common last dance songs for some inspiration.Consider choosing a song that’s meaningful for both you and your new spouse and for your friends and family.

, Think about your family or cultural traditions, and find ways to incorporate them into your unique exit. Consider doing this as a nice nod to your history, especially if your ceremony isn’t otherwise consistent with your traditions.For example, if you are of Indian descent but are not having a traditional, multi-day ceremony, find ways to incorporate clothing, dance, or other culturally relevant details.
If, for instance, you are from New Orleans or if the city is special to you, having the band or DJ play “When the Saints Go Marching In” as your guests wave white clothes would be a nod to New Orleans tradition.

, Whether you go with a traditional nod or unique, out of this world spectacle, make your exit memorable by having your guests send you off to your married life.


More traditional send-off rituals include throwing rice, wheat, or candy. You can also consider less traditional options like confetti, flower petals, or even paper airplanes. You can also go with ribbon wands or handkerchiefs  if your venue won’t allow throwing items.Bubbles, glow sticks, and balloons have all become trendier recently, and are great quirky choices if you want to make a statement.Whatever you opt for, try to choose a material that bears some special meaning for you, your new spouse, and your guests.   

, Your families, wedding planner, venue, and other sources will most likely have plenty of suggestions, preferences, and expectations. However, remember that it's your big day and your party. Remember that you and your new spouse need to make the decisions that are right for you.


If you want to make your exit by sneaking out the side door, feel free! Do whatever will allow you and your new spouse to put each other first.

As the MC, it's your job to keep the event moving forward in a timely manner, keeping to the schedule and helping as best you can. Because of this, you need to be involved in the planning process, not so much to make decisions, but to make sure that you're aware of the order of events and the time frame in which the events need to occur. The night belongs to the bride and groom, but it's your job to help it happen without any problems.


The bride, groom, and other members of the wedding party will typically have something called a ""run sheet"" which will be a detailed itinerary of the various events. Get your schedule ahead of time and keep it on you during the day. Be the militant one.;
, The MC of the wedding is basically the host and communications person of the event. When is it time for tables to approach the buffet line? In what order should they approach the table? Where should presents be placed? When and where will the garter toss commence? These are things you're going to have to know and announce as the MC of the wedding.


Distinguish between things you'll need to announce into the microphone and things that might be ok to say to everyone as they come in the door, or by going around table-to-table and talking to everyone. If you label the presents table, for instance, you won't need to make a big to-do of announcing it every five minutes when people come in.

, To make sure no one from the bridal party or their immediate family has to spend a bunch of time wrangling the catering staff, that's generally going to be the responsibility of the MC. Introduce yourself to the cooks, the servers, the DJ, and anyone else who's going to be directly involved with the evening. Hear them out and accommodate their needs, as well.

, What happens if the catering group is understaffed? What happens if Uncle Phil's keg of wedding beer runs dry? What if the PA goes on the fritz just as everyone's ready to start dancing? Bus tables! Beer run! iPod dock! The party goes on. Come up with a few contingency plans for last-minute fixes and try to keep a positive outlook to make the event as stress-free as possible for the happy couple.


Be willing to run last-minute errands and do extra housekeeping tasks on the night of the reception. If the groom forgot his groomsmen's presents back at the house, don't make him drive and go get it. Volunteer for the little things and you can make a big difference.
Don't be afraid to delegate tasks. If there's a mess to be cleaned up, enlist some lazy cousins and challenge them to a can-crushing contest. Don't be pushy, but don't try to take it on all yourself either., It can be somewhat stressful coordinating everything, making announcements, and making sure everyone gets from place to place. Still, try to remember: It's a party! Have fun, relax, and let people have a good time. try to let people know what's supposed to happen, but if the groomsmen are boisterously toasting the groom in the corner when its five minutes past cake-cutting time, try to get into the swing of things and let loose a bit.


Make things as simple as possible. A wedding MC can make the night smooth sailing, or can tax everyone's fun by being too in-your-face about the little rules. try to keep an eye on the big picture and focus on making things simpler, rather than more complicated.

, The reception will be work for you. Save some time for fun, but you need to get there early enough to make any last minute preparations with the staff, get everything ready and in place, and prepare yourself for the job to be done. There'll likely be seventy things that need to happen just before the party starts, so you probably can't get there too early.


If the ceremony itself takes place elsewhere, try to sit close to the back so you can jet out as soon as its over and head over to the reception hall.

, Standing in front of everyone and moving your lips so no sound comes out, or jarring everyone with a sudden peal of feedback is kind of a bummer for everyone. Don't make the first time you get up in front of the big crowd the first time you've spoken into the house mic.


Practice holding it at the correct distance so you'll be loud enough for everyone to hear and you won't have to go through an awkward sound-check with all the family and friends present.

, Your biggest job will happen right as the reception starts. Everyone will arrive and need to be directed to their table, place their presents, and any other preliminary things that need to happen. It's customary for the MC to introduce themselves, go over the course of events for the evening, just before the bridal party enters, then introduce the bridal party.


Typically, the biggest announcement you'll have to make is when the bridal party enters. You'll need to introduce them, ""The new Mr. and Mrs. _____!"" When the bride is seated, let everyone know they can sit down and visit for a while., Typically, everyone will eat dinner and you won't have anything to do for a while but eat with them. Most of the time, speeches will happen after dessert, at which time you'll grab the mic again and introduce anyone who's prepared a speech for the evening.


Don't give preliminary speeches for each speech. You don't need to tell long-winded jokes about each person (again, you're not the entertainment). Simple is good: ""Next up, let's all welcome the maid-of-honor!""
try to wait until the dinner phase of the reception has wound down enough to get ready for the speeches. If there's a set time limit, try to stick to it as close as possible, but don't rush people who're still waiting to be served so you can jump to the speeches. Let things move in a calm and orderly fashion.

, Different weddings will plan different events, like garter tosses, bouquet tosses, and other ceremonies particular to the couple's wishes. In general, it's probably better to draw people's attention to these types of things more informally and let the couple themselves handle the microphone if there's any reason to.


Again, simple is good. Walk around to the tables and let everyone know briefly and politely: ""Hey everybody! Hope you're all having a good time! I think they're about to do the garter toss on the dance floor in about five minutes if you want to make your way over there.""

, When you're on the mic, try to remember the most important part of being a wedding MC: You're not the entertainment. It's not your job to be funny, it's not your job to tell stories, it's not your job to do anything but make sure everyone knows what's coming up next in the evening, and what they need to do.You'll have an opportunity to talk for a while, usually at the very beginning of the reception, before the bride and groom enter, which is when you can introduce yourself and set the tone of the evening. The room will probably be buzzing and unsettled, anyway, so don't think about launching into that crude story about your spring break trip to Cancun with the groom.

, Even though you've got a naturally witty, charming, and hilarious personality--that's why the lucky couple picked you to MC, no doubt--don't try to rely upon your talents and skills, hoping you'll be able to improvise your way through the night. After a busy and stressful day of the wedding, it's likely your mind will come up blank.


Write down what you're going to say, and keep your script handy on a mobile device or a notepad. Write it like you'll want to read it, word-for-word, so you won't have to fill in the gaps at the last minute.

, Make sure they know what's coming, both in terms of what will be said, who will say it, and when. The night of the wedding isn't the time to shake things up and decide at the last minute that you're going to launch into the best man's speech while the groom's father is outside talking to grandma. Make sure everyone's ready, everyone's on-point with the plan, and stick to it.


Even if the speech-givers want to surprise the party with their speeches, try to find out what's in them and let the bride and groom know. It can be somewhat embarrassing to have to listen to a crude attempt at jokes from someone at a wedding, so it's good to do a little screening. It's not your job to tell them not to give the speech as written, just let the couple know so they'll be prepared and won't be (overly) embarrassed on their night.

, When you've prepared your remarks, try reading them out loud several times to become more familiar with them and make sure it's brief (certainly no more than a minute or two) and articulate. Ask for feedback and make changes.

Consider getting married at a working ranch.,
Look at more traditional wedding venues.,
Arrange accommodations for your guests.,
Take the weather into consideration.",How to Plan a Desert Ranch Wedding1," If you are planning a rustic desert ranch wedding, the best venue may be a working ranch. Ranches provide the perfect backdrop for a desert wedding because they have plenty of barns, horses and cattle onsite to create authentic photos. Although these venues can be picture perfect, they may have some shortcomings. Before booking your wedding at a working ranch ask the following questions:What time of year do you host weddings?
How many guests can you accommodate?
Do you provide accommodations for guests?
Do you provide wedding packages that include food and drinks?
Will you provide tables, chairs, plates, silverware, and glasses?
Some of these amenities may not be provided and will cost extra to hire outside caterers, servers etc.;
, Try and find an event venue that has been made to look like a ranch, but is actually used primarily for hosting events such as conferences and weddings. These types of venues can be found in Texas and Arizona and will likely offer packages that include all of the wedding essentials.Before booking, visit the venue to make sure that you like the atmosphere, environment, and staff.

, If you have settled on a rural ranch wedding then it may be difficult for your guests to find suitable accommodations. Try and find a venue that can provide lodging for your guests, or look for a place off-site that can accommodate them. If you have to find off-site accommodations, provide your guests with transportation to and from the venue., Having a desert ranch wedding likely means that the venue will be outside in order to take advantage of the natural beauty. Whenever you are planning an outdoor event, you must consider the weather. In the desert the weather will likely be very hot.Provide your guests with lots of shading, air conditioning or fans, and water.
Ask the venue if they have a tent or barn available incase of rain.
Consider providing your guests with bug spray at dusk if the bugs are bad in the area.
Have blankets available for guests to use in the evening when the temperature cools drastically.

Consider a light and flowing bridal gown.,
Opt for slightly more casual suits.,
Accessorize with western flare.,
Pick shorter dresses for the bridesmaids.",How to Plan a Desert Ranch Wedding2," An outdoor desert wedding is likely going to be hot. As a result, you should consider a wedding dress that uses light flowing fabric. This will keep the bride comfortable and cool throughout the day. Lace also looks fantastic in a western setting and will echo back to the 19th century and the days of the wild west.Regardless of the style make sure that the bride is comfortable and feels beautiful in the dress of her dreams.

, The groomsmen may look slightly out of place in full tuxedos on the ranch. Instead, opt for more casual suits and light colours. Try a light grey or navy blue suit. You could also remove the jackets and just have the groomsmen wear dress pants, a dress shirt, and a fun bolo tie and western belt buckle., The wedding party can also amp up the ranch wedding theme by accessorizing with a western style. The possibilities are endless and it is up to the personal taste of the bride and groom to determine how far they want to take the western theme.Consider wearing cowboy boots or cowboy hats.
The bridesmaids could wear a cute horseshoe pendant.
The groomsmen could wear bolo ties and large belt buckles.

, Although long bridesmaids gowns are gorgeous, they may look too formal for a ranch wedding. Instead, pick shorter bridesmaids dresses which are more practical for walking around the dusty barnyard and desert. Shorter dresses will also show off the bridesmaids footwear. Short dresses pair nicely with cowboy boots and provide the perfect look for a ranch wedding."

Have water and refreshments available throughout the day.,
Serve classic ranch fare.,
Consider a taco bar.",How to Plan a Desert Ranch Wedding3," In the heat of the desert, you should always have water and refreshments available for your guests throughout the day. During the reception, you could have cold water bottles and sodas available for your guests before they take their seats. You could also have lemonade, punch, or iced tea served in pitchers during the cocktail hour and reception.You could also create a signature cocktail for the guests to try.

, You can even carry the ranch theme throughout the reception. Try serving classic ranch food, such as steak, fish, or wild game. If you want a more casual dining experience, you could opt for burgers or barbecued meats and veggies.


A fun dessert option would be to serve a variety of homemade pies from a local bakery, instead of the traditional wedding cake., Weddings are increasingly offering additional food and midnight snack tables. Give your appetizers and snacks a southwestern feel by offering a selection of Tex-Mex favourites. For example, nachos, tacos, and quesadillas make excellent snacks. You could even create a taco bar, where guests can order a chicken, beef, or veggie taco and then add their own toppings.

"
"
Use succulents and cacti as centerpieces.,
Seat guests at long rustic tables.,
Decorate with mason jars.",How to Plan a Desert Ranch Wedding4," Succulents and cacti make excellent simple centrepieces that complement the western theme of the wedding. Cacti are local to the region and are relatively easy to care for. You can even use a small plant, such as a succulent, for place cards.For example, buy miniature potted succulents and paint the name of the guest on the pot. This will act as a place card as well as a wedding favour.

, To give your wedding a true barnyard feel, seat your guests at long family-style rustic tables. This seating arrangement works well for a casual barbecue meal. It also looks nice in a big barn reception hall. This allows guests the sit together and get to know each other, rather than separating everyone at smaller tables of six to eight people.

, Mason jars are very trendy and will give your wedding an elegant rustic feel, perfect for a desert ranch wedding. Serve cocktails and refreshments in mason jars. They can also be used to hold bouquets and floral arrangements on each table. Tie a colourful ribbon or piece of twine around the mason jars to complement the colour theme of your wedding.


For example, if rose pink and light green are your wedding colours, you could tie a pink ribbon around each mason jar.

Do your research.,
Don't pick the first dress or suit you see.,
Get the input of your family or friends.,
Store your dress or suit in a zipped garment bag after you purchase it.,
Buy shoes.,
Buy accessories.",How to Look Great on Your Wedding Day1," Look at bridal or wedding-related magazines to get a sense of what you want to wear. These magazines are great for inspiration and for narrowing down your choices if you are feeling overwhelmed! You can even start a physical scrapbook or Pinterest board of designs and styles that you like.;
, Even if it looks great on you, make sure you go to at least a few different shops and try on multiple things. You want to be assured that you made the right choice. To remember all your different options, take pictures of your favorite dresses so you can compare. Get the business card of all the shops that you visited and write notes on the back so you can remember where you saw each dress.

, Sometimes, it's hard to know what design looks best on your body type. It's easy to fall in love with a dress or suit and not be able to see that it might not be the best option for you personally. This is why getting the opinion of someone else is invaluable in picking the perfect outfit. , That thing was expensive! You want to make sure it looks pristine on your wedding day, so storing it in a garment bag is vital to making sure it looks the same way on your wedding day as it did the day you bought it.

, Buy your shoes after you buy your dress or suit so you can match them. While you want to buy great-looking shoes, you also should make sure that they don't hurt your feet! Remember that you will be wearing these shoes all day for your wedding. They should be fashionable but also comfortable. When you find a pair of shoes you like, take a stroll in them. Walk around the store for five minutes and see how they feel. If after five minutes they feel like torture, they aren't the pair for you.
Match your shoes to your dress or suit by making sure they are the same shade. If they aren't the same color, make sure that something about them, whether it be an accent or an embellishment, matches your dress or suit.
Try to pick shoes made of soft leather. Soft leather is more comfortable and are less likely to cause blisters.

, Most brides, and some grooms, choose to accessorize their wedding outfits. A stunning necklace, pair of earrings, or watch can be a great way of making the outfit seem complete. For women, a wedding veil is also a traditional accessory they may choose to wear at their wedding. The key to buying the perfect accessory is to find one that matches your outfit but is special and unique on its own.


Choose an accessory that is made of high-quality materials. You want your accessory to not only match your dress or suit in color, but also in the quality of the material. Wearing a cheap-looking accessory will seem out of place paired with your dress or suit. Don't overdo it. Choose one or two accessories. Less can be more when it comes to accessories because too many can look overdone. "

Consider your skin tone and facial features and research what kind of makeup is most flattering for you individually., Think of your wedding makeup as a couple notches above your everyday makeup. For instance, if you normally don't wear makeup, you don't want to show up to your wedding unrecognizable! Kick it up a couple notches but stay away from looks that radically change your appearance.


If in doubt, stick to a clean, classic look. Your wedding day is probably not the day for a dramatic cat eye or purple lipstick. If you a wearing a traditional wedding dress, stick with a clean and natural look. Wearing a red lipstick is a good way to be bold but classic.

Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables.,
Stop eating after you're full.,
Start a skincare routine.,
Moisturize daily.,

If you can't make it to the gym or a fitness class, there are things you can do on your own as a workout. Take a run or a brisk walk around your neighborhood. You can also buy free-weights at stores like Walmart or Dicks Sporting Goods if you want to lift weights.

If you have acne-prone or oily skin, use a water-based sunscreen.
If you are outside swimming, get a sunscreen meant for water exposure.

If you drop something on your dress or suit, immediately got to the kitchen or bathroom. Get a clean napkin or towel and moisten it with water.

While you do not want to ruin the surprise, you need to at least make sure your boyfriend is interested in marrying. Work marriage into your conversations to get a sense of whether proposing is a good idea.You can bring it up directly. For example, say something like, ""Do you think we'll ever get married?""
When discussing marriage, bring up the topic of a proposal. Say something like, ""Do you like the idea of a formal proposal?"" Some people prefer to get engaged together as a couple.
Try checking with a close friend of your boyfriend's to see if he has ever brought up the idea of getting married.;
, See if he wants a surprise engagement, if he wants you to propose to him, or if he'd rather have a conversation first. You can bring this up casually well in advance of your actual proposal, so that it is something you both know about one another.

You might say, ""When you imagine getting engaged, what do you picture?"" or ""Do you have any friends with really great engagement stories?""
If you don't think your boyfriend would love a traditional surprise engagement, think about ways the two of you could mark the occasion together. For instance, he may want the two of you to pick out engagement rings together.

, Think about what your boyfriend would want in terms of a proposal. Maybe your boyfriend has brought up the subject before. Try to honor his wishes, but provide a small twist. This will help keep the surprise and add something extra to your boyfriend's dream proposal. This can be especially nice if the proposal is not entirely a surprise. If you agreed to get engaged within a certain timeframe, for example, your boyfriend may be expecting the proposal.For example, maybe your boyfriend always dreamed of getting engaged on a romantic vacation. Take him on a trip but do not propose on the trip. Instead, pop the question on the airplane on the way there.
Maybe your boyfriend admitted he would like to be proposed to at the coffee shop where you first met. Instead of simply asking him there, surprise him by having a group of friends meet the two of you there holding a sign that says, ""Will You Marry Me?""

, To start, think about where you want to propose. Think about what your boyfriend would want and find a place that's special and meaningful for both of you. Where is somewhere that was or is special for the two of you?You can also define your boyfriend in a couple of words to get an idea of what would suit him, such as traveler, adventurer, romantic, philosopher, etc. This can help you to narrow down your options to identify something that will be meaningful to him.


Would your boyfriend want a public or private proposal? If he wants something private, think about a special place to propose without onlookers. You can propose at home and decorate your house with things like candles and photographs of the two of you. You can also go some place private together, like a secluded hiking trail where you've gone on hiking dates.
If your boyfriend wouldn't mind a public proposal, think about public places you both enjoy. You could propose at the coffee shop where you had your first date. If your boyfriend dreams of a proposal in front of friends and family members, ask him to marry you at a dinner party with friends.

, Think about important dates. You can choose a date that's significant for the two of you. For example, propose to him on his birthday or your anniversary. You can also choose a date that makes logical sense regarding future plans. For example, if you want to be engaged by his cousin's wedding in March, consider proposing some time in January or February.Try to think of a unique date if you want something memorable. Instead of choosing your anniversary, choose another significant date. For example, propose to him on the anniversary of when you two adopted a kitten together.

, Do you think your boyfriend would prefer an engagement ring? Many modern proposals do not use a ring, but if you think your boyfriend would like one you can find one in his size.If you don't want a ring, many people choose another item to symbolize the proposal. You can get him another piece of jewelry, such as a watch, or just give him a gift to mark the occasion. If you can think of a meaningful gift he would really value, such as a musical instrument he's always wanted, go for that.
You can use the gift to propose. For example, tape a sign that says, ""Will you marry me?"" on a guitar you got him.

, Traditionally, men propose to women with rings. Many people feel men will propose when they're ready and women should wait, and that breaking this tradition is a bad thing.If you're a woman proposing to a man, you're breaking tradition slightly. Think about how much your boyfriend cares about you taking the lead.

Many people worry they will be stealing their boyfriend's thunder, or pressuring him into something prematurely. If your boyfriend is truly ready to get married, and is not big on traditional gestures, it is probably okay to propose.
However, if your boyfriend or his family are more traditional, bring up the issue in conversation. Ask your boyfriend how he feels about women proposing to gauge his potential reactions. You can also think about his attitude about gender roles and consider whether he is more traditional or open-minded about proposing.

, An engagement follows a traditional narrative. The man proposes to the woman, usually with a ring.If you're in a same sex couple, or if you're a woman and proposing, you do not have as many set customs and traditions. Think about how you can alter custom to make things work for you.

There is nothing wrong with getting a man a ring to propose. You can select something cut in his style and opt for the tradition down on one knee proposal with a ring. However, some men do not like jewelry. You can choose another object to present him, or you can simply ask him without an object.
One of the benefits of a non-traditional proposal is there are less expectations. See this as a positive rather than a negative. You are following your own narrative and can propose on your own terms.

, Most people get nervous before proposing. However, when you're breaking custom or tradition, there may be an added layer of anxiety. Go into the proposal expecting you will be a little uneasy. Remind yourself why you've made the decision to keep yourself calm.If your boyfriend's traditional family is causing nerves, remind yourself of how happy you and your boyfriend will be after the proposal. This is about the two of you deciding to spend the rest of your lives together, and when you two are alone enjoying your engagement there will be little judgment or stigma attached.Rehearse what you want to say several times until you know it by heart and then remember to keep breathing when you speak these words.

, In any proposal, there will be a range of reactions. However, with a non-traditional proposal, you may find reactions are even more varied. Some people will be shocked that you proposed to your boyfriend. Others will applaud you for breaking tradition. When you choose to announce your engagement, prepare for a range of comments.People have more opinions on non-traditional proposals than traditional ones. While some opinions will be positive, as many enjoy it when others break tradition, other comments will be confused and judgmental. Try to remember you made the decision that was right for you and your boyfriend.
Some comments may be offensive. For example, if you're in a same sex couple, people may feel the person who proposed is more dominant or masculine. It's okay to correct people if they say something hurtful. For example, ""Me and my boyfriend are equal partners. I just happened to have a great idea for a proposal before he did.""
Prepare ahead of time for what you might say if someone says something hurtful to you. This will help you to feel more confident if someone does say something hurtful to you. Also, keep in mind that you do not need to explain yourself to anyone. You can ignore rude comments or give short answers.

, Remember, you made the decision for the sake of your relationship. Even if there is outside judgment, you did what was right for you and your boyfriend. The two of you are happy and going to spend the rest of your lives together. That is what matters, not any outside judgment you receive., Think about how you want things to look. Talk through your ideas with a friend to help you make sure that you have not overlooked anything. It's also okay to ask your friends for help with executing the proposal. If you have control over the scene, set it as much as you can. Remember, you can't control everything, but you can get things somewhat close to your vision.If you're proposing at home, it's fairly easy to set the scene. You can dim the lights and light candles. You can also put up decorations, like pictures of you and your boyfriend.
If you're proposing publicly, you have less control over the scene. However, there are some things you can do to get the scene you want. If you're proposing on a hiking trip, hike at the right time of day so you'll reach your destination right as the sun is setting. If you're proposing at a restaurant or coffee shop, try to get the right table.

, If you're proposing with a ring or another object, find a way to introduce it. You can hide a ring in your pocket or purse and lift out the box when you're ready. At a restaurant or coffee shop, you can have the ring brought out by the waiter in a drink or item of food. Other items can be introduced creatively, depending on what they are.For example, if you bought your boyfriend a nice watch to propose, think about having him close his eyes and then slip it on his wrist.
If you're presenting a ring, think of a fun way to do it. For example, you can leave clues around your home leading him to the ring.

, You can keep things simple. Look in his eyes and tell him something about how much you love and treasure him. Then, say something like, ""Will you marry me?""Some people prefer proposing in a letter. You can compose a brief love letter and hand it to him. Have the words, ""Will you marry me?"" written at the end.

, Sometimes, things do not go as planned. If your boyfriend declines, do not see this as the end of the relationship. There are many reasons someone may not want to get married, some of which may be rooted in practical concerns. For example, maybe your boyfriend wants to wait until you're more financially stable to marry. If he says no, calmly talk it out and figure out where to proceed from there.Keep in mind that you don't need to talk things through immediately. You can take some time for yourself. Just make sure to come back to the conversation eventually.
Remember, you would rather have your boyfriend marry you when he's truly ready than say ""Yes"" just to make you happy. It's better that he thinks about it first to make sure it's what he wants.

, It can be helpful to have people in on your plans. This is particularly important if you need someone to, say, get your boyfriend to the right location at the right time. However, if you want to keep things a surprise, minimize the amount of people you tell. Stick to telling a small circle of friends who you know can keep a secret., In the weeks leading up to your proposal, keep your boyfriend distracted so he doesn't expect anything. Find ways to keep your boyfriend busy so he doesn't notice you're caught up in planning something.Try to encourage him to try new things. You can even do new things with him, if it doesn't interfere with your plans. For example, take a cooking class together or start a new workout routine.
Have your friends help. Ask that the friends who know about the proposal take your boyfriend out more often in the weeks leading up to the big day.

, Your boyfriend may sense something is up. Be ready to quell his suspicions with stories. Think of ways to excuse unusual behavior. If you're out shopping for rings, for example, have your friends say they're taking you on a spontaneous shopping trip., Try to minimize how long you plan the event. The longer you spend planning the event, the more your boyfriend will suspect something is going on. Try to only plan the event for a week or two before you pop the question. This will keep things from becoming stressful. A proposal should be a fun event to celebrate your relationship."

Think about your comfort level.,
Consider how private you want your tribute to be.,
Decide whether you want to explain the tribute or not.",How to Honor Deceased Loved Ones at Your Wedding1," Of course, you want to honor your loved one in the best way possible. However, you should also realize your limits. If the pain is still fresh and you don't want to break down at your wedding, seriously think about what will make you overly emotional and what won't. For instance, having a moment of silence or prayer for your loved one may make you more emotional than including a photo of your loved one., Your tribute to your loved one doesn't have to be for everyone else. It can be just for you, such as a necklace that person gave you. On the other hand, it can be very public, such as a moment of silence. It all depends on what you want.Similarly, you can also think how the person would feel about a public or private tribute, and honor them by giving them what they would have liked most.

, Even if you have a more private tribute, you can have a note in the program about the tribute. For instance, if you have flowers dedicated to your loved one on the altar, you could write a short note about it in the program.For example, it could say, ""The flowers on the altar are in loving memory of the bride's mother, Rebekah Jones.""

Take a moment of silence.,
Wear a piece of jewelry.,
Include them in your bouquet.,
Leave them a seat.,
Make their favorite flower a part of your decorations.,
Use a visual at the end of the ceremony.",How to Honor Deceased Loved Ones at Your Wedding2," Taking a moment of silence is a direct and sweet way to remember the person at your wedding. Generally, this moment should come near the beginning of the wedding. Just ask the officiant to include it as part of the ceremony.For instance, the officiant could say, ""At this time, we'd like to take a moment of silence to remember the bride's mother, Rebekah Jones, who passed away 2 years ago from a rare form of cancer. Please join me in silence.""
Alternatively, you could light a candle in remembrance.

, A simple, private way to honor a loved one is to wear a piece of jewelry or clothing that they gave you or that reminds you of them. For instance, you could wear a necklace your grandmother gave you, or a flower in your hair made out of your great uncle's tie., You can add tiny pictures of your loved ones to your bouquet, such as hanging off the bottom. You can also use ties or clothing from someone you loved to wrap your bouquets in as a remembrance., Try leaving a seat for the person who died. You can reserve the seat with a picture and a note about why the seat is reserved. Then, during the ceremony, you can place a single flower on the seat as a tribute to the person., You could include the person's favorite flower in your bouquets and centerpieces as a tribute to the person. Alternatively, you could have a special arrangement on the altar just for that person, meaning an arrangement to honor that person in particular, using their favorite flowers. The arrangement doesn't need to match the rest of the wedding flowers., Near the end of the ceremony, you could have a moment where you remember the loved one (or loved ones) by releasing balloons into the air. You can also release butterflies, if that's more your style."

Have a photo station at your reception.,
Incorporate something they gave you.,
Offer a toast.,
Make a donation in their name as a wedding favor.",How to Honor Deceased Loved Ones at Your Wedding3," One way to honor your loved one is to set up a photo station at your wedding reception. You could do a collection of photos, along with a short description of who the person is or a quote that reminds you of them.For instance, you could write, ""In loving memory of Kasey's mother, who we know is with us in spirit today.""

, Another way to include your loved one is to use something they gave you in your reception. For instance, maybe your grandmother gave you a cake serving set that you love. Consider using that to serve at your wedding., Generally, the best man and maid of honor give a toast at the wedding, but that doesn't mean you can't give one to honor the person you've lost. You can take a moment to remember them as a way of including them in your special day.Consider including a personal anecdote about the person to really keep their spirit alive.
For instance, you could say, ""At this time, I'd like to give a toast for my mother, who passed away two years ago. She would have loved to have been here today. She was always up for a celebration, and she would have been overjoyed to see me marry the love of my life. She was a kind and gentle woman, and all she ever wanted was to see her children happy. However, I know she is here in spirit. Please raise your glasses in memory of my mother, Rebekah Jones.""

, Traditionally, the couple gives out a small favor near the end of the wedding for the guests to take home. Instead of doing that, you can make a donation in your loved one's name to a charity they would have liked and hand out small cards explaining the favor.The cards could read, ""Instead of providing a wedding favor, we have made a donation to in memory of the bride's mother, Rebekah Jones. Mrs. Jones passed away in 2010.""

"
Be clear on why you do not want to get married.,
Do not play along with the hints.,
Head him or her off before the proposal.,
Deflect pressure from other people.,
Consider the future.",How to Reject a Marriage Proposal1," It is perfectly OK to have a ""gut feeling"" that the marriage would not be successful and simply go on that. However, it is even better to be clear to yourself what your concerns are. If you're simply nervous about making such a big commitment (which is not uncommon) try reading the advice in How to overcome the fear of marriage. If you're concerned that you and your mate are not compatible in some way, it's important to address your worries as soon as possible, long before your partner gets down on their knee. Think about these aspects of the relationship in advance so you're prepared to have a serious conversation:


Does the relationship feel serious and permanent to you, or more lighthearted or temporary? If the other person takes it much more seriously than you do, it could be difficult to find a path together.
Is this a time in life where marriage would derail the path that you've set in mind for yourself? Could you see yourself marrying your partner at a later date?
Do you have strong opinions about marriage in general? Would you rather live together unmarried, or live separately even in a committed, loving relationship?
Do you have concerns about your partner's approach to having children, running a household, financial habits, career goals, or other ""big picture"" items that would make marriage or cohabitation difficult?
Do you have other concerns about your partner or your relationship that are relevant whether or not your get married? These should be discussed as soon as possible, even if marriage is off the table.;
, In an ideal world, the topic of marriage would come up without mind games. However, since this is an emotional issue many people will test the waters before they propose. This may come in jokes, veiled comments, or other subtle ""hints"". If your significant other raises the issue of marriage, even casually, make your position clear but polite. Or call him or her out to clarify.


For example, if your partner comments while house-hunting: ""This house would be perfect for a married couple,"" hint back with another option: ""Or for an unmarried couple too.""
Or, be more direct: ""Honey, you keep making comments about married couples and such. Are you trying to tell me something? I'd rather you be direct with me instead of making confusing comments.""

, Asking a person to have his or her hand in marriage comes with a lot of emotional weight. This may happen in public, such as a restaurant, an athletic stadium, your family's Christmas dinner, or some cleverly elaborate choreographed manner. And to have to turn a person down after all that dramatic build up can be humiliating for the person proposing. If the hints start coming thick and strong, or you discover a ring hidden somewhere, try have a discussion before the proposal happens.


Remember that the purpose of this discussion is information. You should each find out what the other person thinks, not try to persuade them into changing their mind.If your partner cannot set the topic aside, or you cannot agree on a short-term path forward, visit a relationship counselor for advice. Or you may have to part ways.

, Sometimes it can feel like parents, friends, or even complete strangers are eager to whip out a marriage license and hand you a bouquet of flowers. In the end, your decision is not their business, and you do not owe them anything more than basic politeness when deflecting these questions or suggestions:


A polite ""We don't have any plans right now"" is a good first step, or ""I'll let you know whenever something changes"".
Humor can help relieve tension among family members and close friends who are constantly pressuring you: ""I hear they're inventing a new color wedding dress, I'm going to wait a few years for it to hit the market.""
Try acting stiff if strangers or acquaintances do not take the hint: ""Our relationship is fine, thanks for your concern.""

, If you and your partner have both gotten through the conversation (perhaps with help from a counselor), you've bought yourself some time. This is often exactly what you need, but use this time wisely. If it's just a question of reevaluating after finishing your education, you may be content just to see what happens. If you have doubts about the relationship itself, think carefully about whether to stay together, continue to discuss issues with your partner, and seek advice from a relationship counselor if necessary, or from non-judgmental friends who are in healthy relationships and who won't spread gossip.If there are life events that would seriously pressure you to get married, spend time planning for this in advance. Some events you can do your best to avoid, such as pregnancy, while others you cannot control, such as a terminal illness in the family. Seeking advice and support is especially important in these situations, when you feel pressured to make a decision under stress.

Do not make decisions because of another family member. Yes, Grandma would love to see you get married before she dies. But she does not have to live with the consequences of marrying the wrong person, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. And imagine how bad she would feel, knowing the reason for your (likely) divorce, was because she pressured you into the marriage.
An out-of-wedlock and/or accidental pregnancy can be problematic. But getting married for the sake of the baby often ends poorly, too."
"
Don't mislead with your body language.,
Handle a public proposal.,
Stay positive but honest.,
Respond to their unhappiness and confusion.,
Explain your feelings.,
Consider the way forward.,
Avoid making conditional agreements.",How to Reject a Marriage Proposal2," Try not to smile when proposed to, or at least not to beam and look excited. If your mate has gone as far as to pop the question, they are assuming you will say yes, and your smiling will only confirm their hopefulness, which will make the shock of your rejection greater. Look in your partner's eyes tenderly, put your hand over theirs, and give your response in a gentle voice.

, If you are in public when proposed to, ask your suitor to stand up (if necessary), and give them a gentle hug. This is a way to acknowledge that you're touched by your partner's gesture, without saying yes. Hopefully, it is enough to make anyone who's watching lose interest and go back to doing whatever they were doing, which will help ease any embarrassment for your mate.


If people are still watching, take your partner by the hand and quietly ask to go somewhere more private.
Never say yes just to get out of the situation so you can give your real response later. This will just make the later rejection more painful.

, This guide assumes you like the person proposing; if your ex from three years ago leaps out of the bushes holding a ring, ""say no and get out of there"" is all the advice you need. But if the suitor has reason to be hopeful, it's best to break the news gently, without being misleading. Say something appreciative, but keep it short so you can get to your response:


""That's such a moving request. I need time to think about it; it's not something I'd feel right saying yes to straight away. It's a bit of a surprise for me - would you mind if I take some time to think it over?""
""Thanks, that's incredibly wonderful of you but I have so many questions that I've yet to ask you that I'm not sure of our future compatibility yet. Maybe this is a good time for us to sit down and talk about what spending a life together would look like.""
""I love you for asking that, but I don't plan on getting married (for a while / ever). We could move in together instead?""
""I'm honored that you've proposed to me. You're a kind, caring (man / woman). I wish I could say otherwise, but I can't see our marriage working out, and I have to say no.""

, It's likely that the person proposing has put in a lot of effort to asking, thinking through the depths of why they want to spend the rest of their life with you. Letting down their unhappiness gently isn't going to be easy, but there are ways you can help the process:



Give each other space if either of you feels angry or too upset to talk. Let your partner know you'll be contacting them soon (preferably the same day or next morning), but give them time to think until then.
Suggest the two of you do something you both love doing. If your partner wants affection from you, spend the rest of the day together doing something that keeps your occupied. This will serve as a distraction and it will help the other person realize that you still care.

, In private, and once neither of you are actively upset at each other, explain at length what the situation is. Emphasize that your relationship still matters a great deal to you. Describe exactly why you're not prepared to accept. Don't let the other person think it's because they're not good enough.


If you have doubts about the relationship itself, not just marriage, be honest about this. It may not be the best time to air your grievances, but let your partner know that there are problems to discuss once you've both calmed down.

, Things can get really awkward from this point, or they can pick up as usual with good, caring approaches to continuing to nurture your love and relationship. If the proposer is able to accept your position (whether that's an alternative to marriage or delaying the decision for now), then the relationship will likely remain strong and forge on. On the other hand, if this rejection opens a rift in your relationship and causes suspicion, anger, resentment, or discomfort, it may be time to reassess the purpose of staying together. Unless it's clear that the relationship has ended, take a few weeks to sort through the post-proposal emotions before making a drastic decision.

, Telling your partner that you'll say ""yes, if..."" is not about love or reasonable compromise. You may end up in the same situation a year from now, full of resentment that you backed yourself in a corner. Instead, ask for more time to work out what it is that makes you want to reply conditionally. Most likely your real answer is ""no,"" and you should only alter this answer if you have a genuine change of heart.

Propose.",How to Propose to a Woman," You've probably already been thinking this over for some time. The important thing is to know that you love her and consider her to be ""the one"". Write down or think through a list of all the reasons that make you want to marry her. This will be important for expressing your love to her at the proposal, as well as confirming to yourself that you're making the right decision. When you see your girlfriend, you should feel that you absolutely want to share the rest of your life with her, and that the time is right for you to tell her that.


Though they say, ""When you know, you know,"" this can be a little confusing. The important thing is that you propose because you genuinely want to, not because she's dropped so many hints about getting married that you don't want to disappoint her, not because you feel like you've been together long enough and that it's just about time for you to do something, not because everyone around you is getting engaged, and definitely not because your friends, pastor, and family members keep putting the pressure on for you to propose.
Many people believe that you should move in with your girlfriend for at least a few months before you know she's the one. You may like her at a distance, but once you have to share a bed, groceries, and some mutual expenses, you may see an entirely different side of each other that isn't as compatible as you believed. Of course, you don't have to do this, but it's one way of ""double checking"" that you can really see yourself spending the rest of your life with her.
It can help to talk this through with a close friend or family member, as long as you're sure that person won't spill your secret. Avoid discussing your plans too widely with others, as it can soon filter back to her through the grapevine.





;
, Though it's impossible to be able to predict with 100% accuracy that she'll say yes to you, you should have a pretty strong sense that your girlfriend loves you and wants to spend the rest of her life with you. See if she's dropped hints that she wants to get married (to you), that she wants to move in to a house with you, to have kids, to make you a part of her family, and so on. If she's never mentioned these things, then you can try out some feeler conversations to get a sense of her feelings; if she acts uncomfortable or deflects your questions, then she may not be ready to get married.


If you've only been together for a few months, make sure you know that she's in it for the long haul. Though many happily married couples got engaged after being together for only a few months, spending more time with your girlfriend to make sure that you're both the right people for each other can help you make sure she'll say yes.
Though you may be nervous about figuring out her feelings if you're not sure, this can save you from embarrassing yourself during a proposal, when you should have figured out she wasn't ready.

, Although asking a father's permission is considered by many to be old-fashioned, it hasn't died out precisely because it's a gesture that suggests that you respect her and her family and that you're always going to be considerate of her family. It's also a sign of politeness, and what family can resist that? But again, it really depends on the girl and her family situation, so try to feel it out.


Put her first – is this something that would be important to her and her family? Or is it something that might make her cringe? Or maybe she is estranged from her family. Take your cues from your knowledge of her existing situation and preferences. You should know her well enough by now.
Another modern twist on asking for permission is to do so after you've proposed. This can be a way of ensuring that your wife-to-be is the first to be asked but she's aware that you still intend to bring her family right into the fold by asking; this can also be a good excuse to turn up together to share the news. Some people consider that this is the ""wrong way around"" but it's still a sign of respect, and frankly, it's your choice.
If it isn't possible to ask her father, ask her mother.

, It's important to get the timing right, and timing is really only something that you can work out. It's not possible to say that there are perfect times to propose, but it is important that you propose at a time when you're not rushed and when you feel calm, sorted, and ready. Once you've planned the proposal in as much detail as possible, then the time will be right. Here are some things to keep in mind:


Is there a meaningful day to the both of you? Such as an anniversary of your relationship or first date, or some other commemoration?
Sometimes the time chooses itself by sheer practicality, especially if the two of you are living in different cities and come together for a special holiday event and this is your only chance to ask her.
Consider the time of year she wants to get married. It's helpful to ask her or indirectly through her friends or family if there is a certain season, month, or length of time she wants to be engaged in order to plan the wedding without feeling overwhelmed or rushed. If she's mentioned that she wants a fall wedding, try proposing around that time the year before -- if you propose just a few months before the fall and she wants a bigger fall wedding, she may not like the idea of waiting well over a year to get married.
Proposing on special holidays or birthdays has advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand, these days can make the occasion more meaningful, especially if family is gathered around or it's a time of great joy. On the other hand, you will always share your proposal date with the holiday date; if you want to celebrate your engagement date, this can make it feel less impersonal for some, while for others, it's a great way to remember!
Whenever you do it, make sure you have some alone time right after the proposal. If you plan on proposing to her on Thanksgiving with your families nearby, for example, make sure you take her out on a long walk or somewhere private when you do it, before you get overwhelmed by family and don't have a minute to yourselves to process what just happened.

, The place and atmosphere of the proposal will be remembered forever and the most important thing to remember is that you are the principal creator of the atmosphere! Naturally, you can propose absolutely anywhere, but it helps to choose a place that will be meaningful for both of you and where you can feel comfortable, calm, and natural.


Where are her favorite places? Does she love the beach, sunsets, tall buildings, bridges, cityscapes, nature, etc.? Or maybe she'd prefer a private screening at the local cinema?






What is practical? The harder you try to create a special occasion, the more things can go wrong. Sometimes it's just easier to focus on what you know will work and will be appreciated by both of you.
Consider romantic places such as the beach, a botanical garden, a famous restaurant with an amazing view, a covered bridge, a picnic, etc.
Consider the safety of the location. A man once proposed to his girlfriend on a cliff; she said yes, but became so excited that she slipped and fell to her death. This is why you should always take safety into account when proposing to your lover.
Consider the things the two of you love doing together. Perhaps this can serve as a source of inspiration, such as proposing when you're out camping, fishing, sailing, hiking, cycling, attending a sports event, traveling somewhere, etc. The benefit of proposing during something you love doing together is that she won't suspect that you'll be proposing, since it'll be part of your usual routine.






Make reservations if you need to. If you're proposing somewhere like a restaurant where you need to be able to get the best table, etc., be sure to reserve it well in advance.







, Once you've decided the when and the where, the intimate details of the how need consideration. Naturally, there is the ring to produce, but what other elements do you want to add into the mix to make this an especially memorable and romantic occasion for her? Bear in mind that the manner in which you propose will be retold by her many times over, so make sure it's good! There are many possibilities and it's entirely up to you what you do but for some inspiration, here are some suggestions:

Try the traditional pose. Bend down on one knee, take her hand in yours and ask her to marry you. The beauty of this gesture is that it's universally recognized thanks to the movies, and it can be performed anywhere. Just note that if there are other people around, they'll be eavesdropping (kindly!), so expect their interest and support.






Get a sense of whether she'd like something public or a bit more private. Though many women are proposed to in public in the movies, in real life, most engagements are private. You may think it's a great idea to propose to hear at half-time during a sporting event or at an intimate party with several of your friends around, but she may be mortified by all of the attention. Plus, if it doesn't go well, you'll feel even worse in front of a bunch of people.
Think about things that might accompany the occasion, such as a quartet playing a tune or a serenade, or a tiny fireworks display, etc. These sorts of extras are not necessary and they will bloat the budget unless you've got willing friends to help out, but if it's your kind of thing, they can add to the atmosphere.
Hide the ring. This is another popular method for proposing that requires her to find the ring, and then you do the proposing. Places to hide a ring include inside flowers, chocolates, or a special gift. Be sure to ask her to open the gift at the time, or you might be waiting ages! And take great care not to hide it somewhere that she can accidentally swallow it; that'll put a big dent in the occasion.
Be creative. If you're not so traditional or you're not that keen to say the proposal yourself, there can be a number of other ideas for proposing that involve some more planning but can be really entertaining as well as confirming for her that you're the kooky guy she wants to spend the rest of her life with. You could prepare her very own word puzzle or crossword in which the final answer spells ""Will you marry me?"".
You can do something small and cute involving children in your families, or even a pet that you own together.
If you have the means and think she'll like it, you could have a plane write the question across the sky as the two of you are walking along.
Proposing on a vacation is another popular move. If you do this, just make sure that she'll say yes! Nothing will make your vacation worse than a rejection on the first night.
Perhaps use publicity, such as taking out an advertisement in the paper that you know she'll read, or getting her favorite radio DJ to announce the proposal, or place a big banner with the question on it over a bridge she drives under every day.







, If you know what kind of ring your girlfriend wants, then great. But if you don't know or don't want to ask, get a temporary ring, and then get another after you propose; for many women, choosing their own ring is the preferred option. But if you know exactly what kind of ring she wants, then you should try to sneak out a ring she usually wears to get it sized and to find out her ring size. She'll be touched that you remembered exactly what she wanted -- and that you got it in the correct size! But if you have no idea what kind of ring she wants, asking her about it ""casually"" will pretty much let her know what's on your mind.


You don't have to blow a fortune on an engagement ring, especially if you really can't afford it. It's better to get something small and classy and to save for your future together instead of spending all your savings on a piece of jewelry.
If budget is a concern, consider all types of natural diamonds. The diamond industry now offers many types that fit within everyone's price range including clarity enhanced, laser drilled, and natural GIA certified HPHT diamonds.

, Dress well to be sure that you're as handsome and attractive as can be. This is a very special occasion and it deserves to be ""picture perfect"". She'll appreciate the effort you've gone to. Naturally, this only applies where you're planning to propose somewhere elegant and you have time to change beforehand. If you're proposing on the beach, during a hike, skiing, or as you're skydiving, use your common sense about what to wear!

, If you're going to propose, it pays to practice. Practice asking, and practice explaining the reasons as to why you love her so much that you want to spend the rest of your life with her. This will help you avoid being tongue-tied when the important moment comes up. This doesn't mean you should put a lot of pressure on yourself. Though it helps to make your girlfriend feel extra special, in the end, she may only remember the words, ""Will you marry me?""


Keep the proposal simple, to the point, and from the heart. For example: ""Mel, I love you more than words can ever express. You're the most thoughtful, generous, kind, and beautiful woman I've ever had the fortune to know and I'd be honored to have the chance to spend my life with you. Will you marry me?""

, There is no time like the present to move on with your carefully thought through plan. Bring her along to ""the place"" and start unfolding your plans. Be sure that you don't give things away by touching the ring in your pocket constantly, or saying daft things. If you're bringing her to a place she's never been before, or somewhere extra romantic, and you have a feeling that if you're there for more than thirty seconds, she'll know exactly what you're up to, then try to propose as soon as you can, so you don't lose any of the surprise factor.

There may be tears, screaming, or shock. Don't be fazed; these are fairly standard reactions, even if she has every clue of what you're about to do. It's not real to her until it's done!
If she says yes, end the proposal with a kiss or a hug. And don't forget to put a ring on her finger!






If she says no, react with understanding and don't be petulant. She may need time to think and a memory of your sour face and grumpy attitude will leave a bad impression in her mind. Be a gentleman and don't be down on yourself -- you tried your best.

Proposing with extreme sporting.",How to Propose to a Man," Marriage is a big step and you want to be sure that you're taking that step for the right reasons, because you've found someone that you honestly want to spend the rest of your life with, not because all your friends are getting married and you think you need to, as well.If you're looking to get married because you're trying to 'save' the relationship or because you're scared of being alone, those are not reasons to get married. In fact, it's probably a good idea to let the relationship go.
However, if you know for certain that marriage to this guy is what you want, then it's time to go for it and put your energy into making it happen.;
, Popping the question should not be the first time the two of you discuss commitment and marriage. You don't necessarily have to talk about it in terms of the two of you (although, you probably should) but it is important to suss out his feelings about this very important thing, especially if you're going to be proposing to him.Pay attention to how he talks about the future and what he says. If he talks about ""we"" and ""us"" (referring to the two of you) in future endeavors, if the two of you live together, own a pet together, have moved somewhere together, he is pretty committed to you.
This does not necessarily mean that he is ready for marriage, or even wants marriage, so that is something the two of you should discuss.
You can even find a way to talk about relationships in general, or bring up your concerns up in a potential, distant future type of way. For example: ""Becky just proposed to Henry in front of his entire family. I think I'd want to do a quieter proposal, don't you think?""

, When you're planning to propose to a guy you want to make sure that the proposal is about him and what he loves. If you wanted a big proposal in a fancy restaurant in front of everyone, that doesn't mean he would want that. You know your guy best, so make sure you use that knowledge.For example, if he's really in to fishing, plan a fishing excursion with him and put a note in the tackle box that says ""will you marry me?""
Another example: if he's a big fan of a certain band, plan a proposal around a show the band is doing in your area (or go wherever the band is performing, even if it's a distance away).
This doesn't mean that you should ignore yourself and your desires completely. The proposal should be something that is important and memorable to you, as well. You just have to find some sort of middle ground. For instance, you could follow the fishing date with a three-course candle-lit dinner at a lovely restaurant.

, Spontaneity is a great thing, but for something like a marriage proposal, you want to have enough of it planned that you can follow the plan even when you're nervous (because you will be nervous, but that's expected!). especially if you're making it a big deal, you want to have all the components figured out.


You'll need to pick a specific place to pop the question, preferably somewhere that has meaning to both of you. It could be where you went on your first date, or it could be the first place you kissed. Picking a place that has meaning to you both works two ways, one, it's already special to you both and two, it provides a great segue into your proposal!
Timing is everything. It's better to pick a time when he's relaxed and receptive to making or thinking about making a big change. It's less good to do it when he's stressed about work or school, or distracted by something else (like if you're both at a football game and he's paying more attention to the game than you and what you're trying to ask).
You'll want to make sure that the mood is right for what you're about to do. It could be something as simple as lighting a few candles, or pouring out some nice champagne, or you could have a whole lavish dinner set-up. You'll need to consider what is important to the two of you.
If you're including other people in your proposal (children, family members, friends, animals) you'll need to make sure that they know what they're supposed to be doing and when and especially that they need to keep quiet about it so they don't spoil the surprise.

, Again, when you're plotting how to ask him, think about his hobbies and interests and use those as a way to make the proposal special. Not only does this show that he's important to you (since you are, after all, asking him to marry you), you're also showing that you pay attention to his interests and that you support them.For example: if he's interested in archaeology, volunteer for an archaeological dig with him and propose on the dig (you can enlist your fellow volunteers to help). Or you could even make a treasure hunt type proposal and have him dig up the proposal in the backyard.

, In every rom-com ever it seems, there's a scene where one person proposes to another and it's always in front of a bunch of people, but, especially for a guy, it's best to do this part in private (unless he's specifically said that he wants to be proposed to in front of a bunch of people).


This way it gives him a chance to think about the proposal without the weight of a bunch of people waiting for his decision. Once he's said yes, feel free to go announce it from the rooftops.

, Even if you're planning an elaborate proposal (a sky diving extravaganza, or a scavenger hunt), try to keep the actual proposal itself simple and to the point. What you really need to do with it is tell him why you want to spend the rest of your life with him and would he want to do the same with you. You'll be nervous (because, who wouldn't?) so keeping it simple makes it easy for you to remember what you're going to say.


Have a few lines to lead up. You could say something like, ""We have so many awesome memories... From now on, I want ALL my memories to have you in them."" and propose. Or, before your day, ""I have this wonderful day planned for us, but I just can’t wait... I want us to spend it together as more than just boyfriend and girlfriend"" and then propose.

, You'll want to give him some sort of symbolic gift, like an engagement ring, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a ring, especially if he isn't the type to wear a ring. You know your guy best, so you'll have to decide what the gift should be, but there are lots of options.You could get him a wrist watch or pocket watch, because these are sometimes considered the male form of jewelry anyway. You could even have it engraved with both of your names to make it more special.
You could make something handmade for him, like a box containing all your favorite memories together, or a ceramic plate that asks him to marry you.
If he's the type who wears necklaces, you could get him an engagement necklace, perhaps even with a ring on it.
Engraved lighters are also, often, used as engagement gifts for men (or women) and can be very cool and attractive.

, As you can't control the outcome, proposing to someone can be very nerve-wracking and make you feel vulnerable. That's no reason not to do it, but you have to be prepared for every eventuality.


If he says yes, great! It's time for a party. You can set the wedding date, or leave that until sometime in the future (you don't have to get married right away, just because you got engaged).
If he needs time to think, that doesn't necessarily mean he's going to say no. The proposal may simply have caught him by surprise and he really does need to think about what it will mean. Let him do that. If he doesn't get back to you, talk to him about the proposal and what his concerns are.
If he says no, you are going to feel upset and you have every reason to ask him what his reasons are and if will ever change his mind. It could simply be that there is too much going on at the time (school, a big move, his parents are ill) and he can't think that far ahead, or it could mean that he doesn't want to get married. Whatever the reason is, you're going to have to make some choices about your future, as well. It could be that the two of you aren't compatible and don't have the same life goals.

, You could have it be a treasure hunt of all the places around your city that are important to you, or a treasure hunt that plays on some of his hobbies. There's no wrong way to do a treasure hunt (unless it's too hard and he can't complete it). He'll be having a great time and be in fun mood for the last clue (the proposal).

, Lots of people like a good proposal that has to do with food (as long as he doesn't end up eating the proposal by accident!). There are lots of ways to use food to make a fun marriage proposal.


There are ways to have personalized fortune cookies made. You could have one made that says 'Will you marry me?' and make sure it gets mixed in when you get take-out (or if you make some lovely Chinese food).
Hide a note and symbolic engagement gift (not necessarily a ring) amid a box of delicacies and give them to him. Again, make sure he doesn't eat the note or the gift by mistake.

, Around Halloween go to the pumpkin patch and challenge your guy to a pumpkin carving contest. While he's diverted, carve 'will you marry me?' on your pumpkin and present it to him when you're both finished carving. You'll probably win the contest then.

, Obviously, this one isn't for everyone, but if you and your guy are super into extreme sports, it's a great way to pop the question. You'll probably need the assistance of your friends or instructors, so make sure they don't give away the game beforehand!


Go sky diving with your guy and have your friends spread out a sign below the two of you that asks him to marry you.
Go scuba diving and have a waterproof sign already planted down on the ocean floor for your guy to find with you as you're swimming around down there together.

Serenade her proposal to her.",How to Propose to a Woman Creatively1," Especially if she’s fond of her family (or yours!) you can make your proposal a group affair with her favorite people. You could have her aunts and uncles wear shirts that spell out “Will you” and younger cousins in shirts that spell out “marry me?” You might even have the family hold up a “Will you marry me?” sign, while you kneel before it, extending her your ring.


Another way you could involve her family is by proposing at a family party or event, like a family Christmas party. Hide your ring inside a present, and be sure to be by her side when she opens it. When she realizes what it is, you can ask her the question you’ve been waiting for.
Family games, like a scavenger hunt, can also turn into memorable proposal opportunities. Bring the game planner in on your scheme, and have a special set of proposal clues made for your girlfriend. Await her arrival at the end of the hunt with your engagement ring in hand and someone nearby to snap a couple candid photos.
You might turn a family game of charades, sometimes called gestures, into your proposal. Orchestrate it so that you and your partner are on the same team. Then, when it’s your turn to go, get her to ask the question, “Will you marry me?” in gestures. When she finally gets the answer, drop to your knee and hold out the ring.;
, This will require some time, effort, and potentially some dancing skills on your part. But a marriage proposal through the coordinated song and dance of a group of people will make yours impossible to forget. You’ll have to get together a large group of your friends or hire performers, design your flash mob routine, practice, and then pull it off in public. For more particulars, you should check out how to organize a flash mob.


There are many locations you can spring your flash mob proposal on your bride-to-be. You might choose a mundane, everyday location where it’s sure to surprise, like a supermarket, train station, or a downtown area. You could even waylay her with your flash mob proposal on your way to a special dinner date!
If you’re not as confident in your ability to perform in public, you might want to put together a digital flash mob proposal. This has the added benefit of limiting outside interruptions and other potential mistakes that could occur during a live flash mob performance. Have a friend or a professional record your flash mob at a private location, add music, and then use it to propose.
The budget for your flash mob can be expensive. To keep things affordable, you may want to forego hiring a photographer and instead hire a videographer. This way, all your hard work, your cool choreographed moves, and the lovely message of matrimony at the end can be watched over and over again., While it might be impossible to get her favorite actor to show up and help you seal the deal, you might be able to get a written message from a celebrity that you can use with your proposal. You should check and see if there are any signings or meet-and-greet opportunities you can take advantage of. At these events, you’ll likely get a chance to explain your proposal plans and get a handwritten message from her favorite star.


Authors are well known for signing special messages to fans in their books. If your beloved possible bride has an author she’s particularly keen on, you could look up book signing dates or tour dates for that author. Come prepared with a book for the author to sign, and then at the signing, request the author to modify the message for your purposes. You might ask them to write, “To <Bride’s Name>, soon to be married to a lucky guy!” or something to that effect.
Depending on the message written, you might frame it in glass along with a picture of the two of you together. This would be a perfect surprise gift to lead into your proposal. Then, when she sees the message from her idol, have the engagement ring ready so you can pop the big question., Unless you’re a one-man-band, you might want some backup when it comes to your wedding proposal serenade. You can choose a romantic song that will sweep her off her feet, or you can write a song of your own. There are many ways you can approach this. You could take center stage yourself and sing karaoke style, or you could allow a performer to sing for you while you prepare to bend knee and propose.


Many couples have a romantic song that is special to both. If you have a romantic song, or if you know your girlfriend's favorite romantic song, you can use this in your serenade. Whether you blast it from a sound system of a restaurant or sing along to it while it plays on your phone speakers at an intimate locale, she’ll surely appreciate your thoughtfulness when you finish the song by asking for her hand in marriage.
Many popular songs have arrangements for various musical instruments. If you play an instrument, you might accompany the serenade as part of your proposal. Music arranged for your instrument can likely be found at your local music store, or online through a music retailer."

Then you can use video and photo editing software on your computer to make a photo montage. You can even include a few video clips of you together, but when you’re done you should burn your wedding proposal presentation onto a blank DVD or USB memory stick. You don’t want your future bride stumbling across your hard work and ruining the surprise!


You can use captions or text boxes at the bottom of your presentation to show just how much she means to you. At the end of the presentation, you could show the question “Will you marry me?” along the bottom of the screen with a video clip or image of you holding out the ring to the camera. Then you can mimic the gesture in real life, so when she turns from the video, there you are, on bended knee holding out her ring.
To add some extra surprise to your proposal, you might use some help from others and have your marriage proposal played somewhere she won't expect. This might be at an awards banquet, before a movie at a theater, or even at a family party.
Use some kind of excuse, like a DVD marathon, to set the trap for your proposal. Make sure it's realistic, otherwise she might know you’re up to something! Prepare popcorn, order her favorite meal, or maybe make her a favorite snack. When you’ve both settled in, play the DVD, and get ready to fish her engagement ring out of your pocket., An aerial banner is a long streamer attached to the back of an airplane. These are often used as advertising gimmicks, and can be seen at beaches, athletic events, and parks. An aerial advertising company near you can be found through an online search, or perhaps even through contacting the customer services of your local airport.


Before contacting an aerial advertising company, you’ll need to think of the message you want on the banner. Something short and sweet, like “Will you marry me?” will save you money, but you may want to use your own words. Remember, messages that are too long might be difficult to read up in the sky!
You’ll also need to think of a suitable, wide-open space where you and your partner will be able to see the message. A public park, a local pier that juts out from a waterfront, or a similar location might work well for viewing your banner. If you notice her look up, get ready to bend your knee and pop the question, but you might have to direct her gaze by saying, “What’s that up there?” While she’s looking up and reading the message, get on one knee and extend her ring toward her.
A common variation on the banner proposal is skywriting. This is where an airplane uses special smoke that hangs in the air for a period of time to spell out a message. For more information, you should look into how to arrange a marriage proposal in skywriting., Especially if your beloved is a fan of scrapbooks and mementos, a physical compilation of your good times and the love you have shared can also be used to propose. Gather photos, items that remind you of time spent together, and other supplies to create a proposal scrapbook.


At the end of your scrapbook, you might write the message “Will you marry me” along with an arrow pointing toward the side of her which you plan on sitting. When she reaches this page, kneel and hold up your ring so that when her eyes follow the arrow, she sees that it’s pointing to her ring.
A digital scrapbook might be a good alternative for the more technologically adept. You can upload your pictures from social media or other places, or scan your physical pictures to use in your digital scrapbook.
You might even include the ring as part of the scrapbook. You can use the clear plastic of your scrapbook to form a pouch for your ring on the last page along with your proposal message. This way, when she turns the last page, all you need to do is bend your knee and wait for her eyes to meet yours. Then you can ask, “Will you?” to hear her reply., A ring can be the perfect ornament to top an elegant desert, to hide in the bottom of a celebratory drink, like champagne, or to hide as a prize in a favorite snack. You might hide your ring in a plastic egg to keep it clean, then place the egg as a prize in a box of her favorite treats.


If you are planning on proposing during a fancy dinner, you might want to bring the restaurant in on your plans. This way the wait-staff can help you make your proposal go as smoothly as possible. The chef could place the ring artfully on a desert platter, or your server might distract your partner so you can secretly slip the ring into her glass.
Be careful when hiding your ring as a “prize” in a box containing a favorite snack or candy. There’s always a chance that the prize could be missed! Be sure you are on the scene to prevent any mishaps or accidental ring disposals., Your partner may be especially fond of a TV, movie, or book series that you can employ in your wedding proposal. You could recreate a scene and use your ring and proposal as its climax, you could use a prop from the series to present your ring, or you could propose in a way the characters of the series might.


If your girlfriend is a fan of the Dr. Who series, you could hide your ring in a Tardis cookie jar. Since a running joke about the Tardis is “It’s bigger on the inside,” you might attach a note to the ring you’ve placed inside the Tardis that says, “And so is my heart when you’re with me. Will you marry me?”If your girlfriend is and avid reader and you know she is planning on rereading her favorite series, you could buy an extra copy of the book and hollow out the pages and then store the ring inside with a message. This way, when she opens it up to read, she’ll see your proposal. You can earn bonus points by using her old copy for the hollowed out proposal and buying a signed copy to replace the one you destroyed.
For a fan of Lord of the Rings, you could arrange a massive theme party in the style of Bilbo’s final birthday celebration. Then, much as Bilbo passed the ring onto Frodo, you can present your beloved with her engagement ring at the end of the party. You might even say something like, “Just as there was only ever one ring, you will always be the only one for me.”, Flowers are a common romantic gift exchanged between partners, but you can use these creatively to convey the depths of your love. You might send a rose each day for 11 days, and save your proposal for the 12th. She’ll most likely be expecting a final rose to finish of the dozen, but you could present her with a full dozen on the 12th day, along with a ring and your proposal.


You might communicate your feelings by spelling out a message with flowers or petals. Be careful when doing so, as some petals and flowers can stain fabric. Light some candles to add a romantic ambiance and make your proposal extra special.
Make a mix-and-match message proposal with flowers. Buy 14 of her favorite blooms and attach a piece of paper to the stem of each. On each paper, write a single letter of the 14 letter phrase “Will you marry me” and send them to her one at a time or hide them around the house.
Time your deliveries so that she receives a flower every hour on the hour throughout the day. Then, when the 12th hour arises, you can make an appearance with the final flower of the bouquet, your ring, and your proposal to her."

Propose at the place you first met.,
Propose in a luxurious hotel.,
Propose at a religious ceremony.,
Propose using a scavenger hunt game.,
Propose during half-time game.,
Propose on live television.,
Propose during breakfast in bed.,
Propose while announcing a holiday you have paid for as a surprise.",How to Propose to a Woman Creatively3," This one won’t need as much preparation simply because this place will be special already to both of you. You can make her think it’s a casual date by pretending you don’t remember the significance of the spot. But when you’ve finally arrived, you may want to start talking about the time you first met as a lead in to your proposal.


Some topics you might want to use to set the tone for your proposal include: what you thought about her the first time you saw her, what makes her special to you, and how she still makes you feel. You might also bring up particular moments that you shared where you overcame an obstacle or you spent your time together enjoyably.
Set out candles or other romantic touches. If you first met at a park, you might have a blanket laid out close to the exact location you met. Scatter your blanket with some sweet smelling blossoms to up the romantic appeal. She’ll think you’re just being charming, but when you ask her to marry you, she’ll likely think you’re her one and only., A special occasion will make the extravagance of a hotel stay a little less suspicious to her. You might tell her it’s for her birthday or your own. You could plot to spring this proposal around the time of your anniversary or some other special date that you celebrate together. Call or text her and let her know you’ve arranged a hotel reservation for the two of you.


To make it an even bigger surprise, don’t tell her any more than she needs to know. Inform her of the date, time, and room number. Then you can leave the door unlocked so she can walk in. But Before she does, you should arrange the room for maximum romance. This might mean playing soft, sweet music in the background, or even leaving a trail of scattered flower petals to a balcony with a table set for two. Then, when the moment is right, all you have to do is ask.
Some hotels might have services in place for wedding proposals. While you are booking your hotel, you should let the person handling your reservation know that you plan to propose to your soon-to-be spouse on this day. The booking agent might be able to suggest a more suitable room, or a special room service course that you and your partner can enjoy., Many religions look at the commitment of marriage as a commitment before the divine. If you and your girlfriend, or either of your parents, are religious, or if you want your proposal to have a sacred, reverential tone, you might propose before, during, or after a religious service. She might be even more pleasantly surprised if, following your proposal, her friends revealed they had been watching all along as part of the congregation.


You’ll want to coordinate your plans with the clergy presiding over the service to prevent any disturbances. Marriage is a joyous occasion, and sharing the start of that journey with fellow believers will likely be warmly regarded. You might even be able to play music on the sound system, or have the church band plan a special song leading up to or following your marriage proposal.
You might want to involve the presiding minister and ask him or her to offer a blessing for your engagement. This is an easy way of leading into your proposal. First the minister can say some words of encouragement or offer a special message, and then turn the stage over to you for your special question.Be certain this kind of proposal won't embarrass your hopeful bride to be! Public proposals can put pressure on her to say yes, even if she's not entirely certain.

, A scavenger game is sort of a treasure hunting game with map, clues, and other features. You can pretend this game is nothing more than a special date you’ve planned for her or something you read about online that you thought might be fun. This way, she doesn’t suspect that you’re about to propose.


You can also include your friends and tell them about your plan. Friends can help you think of clever clues for the hunt, set up those clues so they are ready for your girlfriend to find, and can even help you keep an eye on your partner’s progress through text messages.
Avoid making the questions for your scavenger hunt too difficult. You don’t want to be waiting too long at the other end, but you also don’t want your girlfriend getting frustrated along the way! While she’s out finding and solving the clues you’ve left, you can prepare the ending location to be extra romantic.
Be careful where you arrange the scavenger hunt, the path should not contain anything hazardous. For example, you arrange for your girlfriend to walk across some rocks on the beach to find the next clue, but she ends up slipping and injuring her foot. Not very romantic!
You might end your scavenger hunt at the beach, in a restaurant, a hotel room, at the place you first met, or anywhere you think she’ll appreciate. When she’s finally found you using the map, clues, and the hints you gave her, give her a reward she’ll never forget – a small box with a ring inside.
You can put a spin on the normal scavenger hunt by going geocaching instead! Geocaching is where an item is hidden somewhere no one will find without precise location information, like longitude and latitude. Or you might start off with a point and have this turn into a series of clues. Learn how to create and hide a geocache for more details., Even if your wife-to-be isn’t a big sports fan, she’ll know how serious you are about your engagement when you do it in front of a stadium full of people! You’ll have to contact stadium officials to see what the policy is for wedding proposals and how you might organize your proposal to be broadcast on TVs and screens across the entire stadium.


You could arrange for a quick, heartfelt proposal before, during, or after the half-time break. After making the arrangements, all you need to do is prepare a short speech, gather a lot of courage, and pop the question, “Will you marry me?”
Have your friends sit together on the other side of the stadium, and then when the moment is right, send them a signal, like a text message. Then your friends can lift up signs that spell out “Will you marry me?” When she notices the sign and wonders who is proposing, you take a knee and hopefully her hand in marriage, too.Consider this kind of proposal carefully before putting it into action. Proposals in front of large crowds can be overwhelming. She might prefer a more intimate proposal

, There are a number of TV shows out there that will use any excuse to add drama to the show. The most accessible kind of TV show for average people to join is most likely a game show. Game shows frequently use ordinary people to compete in challenges to win money and prizes. Of course, you won’t really be joining the show for the prize money. You’ve got a bigger prize in mind – her hand in marriage!


You might want to discuss your proposal plans with the staff of the show beforehand. These people can help ensure you get you get the perfect chance to pop the question even if things go differently than planned. Win or lose the game, you’ll still hopefully get the girl!
Certain game shows choose candidates at random from the audience. Even if you can’t get the gameshow staff to help you out with your proposal, they’ll be hard-pressed to stop you if you’re already in the audience. Simply plan your moment, and show her and the rest of the world you’re ready to love her forever.Live TV doesn't always go as planned. Be sure that this is the right way of proposing to your bride-to-be before you decide to pop the question on a live broadcast. Your girlfriend might say no, and then you both may go down in infamy.

, Some gals like a more laid back and intimate approach. You can spring your question on her following her favorite breakfast while staying at an opulent bed-and-breakfast. If a bed-and-breakfast isn’t your style, do the same while in the comfort of your own home. Wake up early and leave bed as quietly as possible, add a few romantic touches, like rose petals on her breakfast tray, and when the moment is right, bend your knee and ask for her hand in marriage.


Time your breakfast preparations to coincide with the time she normally wakes up. You don’t want all your delicious food to get cold, or to awake her too soon and spoil her rest.
You could also commemorate a day that’s already special by adding your proposal to it. This way, she’ll think that you’re celebrating something else, like your anniversary, when you arrive with her tray and food. When you spring the question, she’ll be extra surprised.
Take some time to tell her how special she is and why you love her more than anyone else. Keep eye contact with her as you slowly kneel down on the floor beside the bed, open that small special box and ask her your question: “Will you marry me?”, Take her somewhere that has sentimental value, or plan your trip for a romantic place she’s always wanted to visit. When you surprise her with her holiday, present her with her ticket, but not the real one. Have a fake ticket with the words ""Will you marry me"" typed on it, or use your best handwriting and write out your message on an old ticket from a trip you went on together before.


Buy refundable tickets. Even if you’ve taken every precaution, there’s always a small chance you could be rejected. As much as you might not want to think about this, it would be even more bitter to lose your lover and have to foot the bill for a non-refundable trip for two.
Come up with an excuse for your trip, like celebrating a recent accomplishment such as graduation or a promotion, and then surprise her with the engagement ring at an opportune moment. You might have a stewardess bring your girlfriend a glass of champagne with the ring inside, or you might arrange to have the captain announce your engagement to passengers on board."
"
Tell your mom that you really love this person and that nothing she says or thinks will ever change these feelings.,
Tell your mom that you love her.,
Keep calm.,
Tell your mom that you're an adult now and that she raised you well to think for yourself and that that is what you're doing now.

,
Realize that your mom probably has the best of intentions at heart.,
Consider getting together for a three-way chat.,
Realize that it is going to take time for your mom to come around.,
Find a supporter or two from within the rest of your family.,
Stand by your final decision.,
Stay positive and keep your partner informed at all times.",How to Get Married to Someone Your Mother Doesn't Like," This lets her know that you have made a decision, no matter what she thinks. Remind her that this is about the person you intend spending the rest of your life with.;
, She needs reassurance that your choice of life-mate is not a personal rejection of her. She has stated her case, and you disagree. But you haven't stopped loving your mom for herself. Sure, her ideas about your love life are jarring but that doesn't lessen the love you hold for her.

, Don't make a scene for any reason; this just gives your mom a reason to come back at you and turn it into something ugly. Often, your mom may make a case for the idea that you're immature, and not thinking things through enough. Blowing up at her will only prove her point. Instead, stay calmly resolved and just keep telling your mom that this is how things are going to be, and when she is ready to accept it, you will be fully happy. Making it an issue of your personal happiness will help her to stop and think about what is really at stake here - your life, not hers.

,, It's possible that there is something she sees in your betrothed that has set off alarm bells for her from her own personal past experiences. While her experiences are not yours, it might pay to at least consider whether any of her points are valid and address them with your partner before proceeding.


For example, if your mom thinks that your betrothed is after your money, have an open discussion with your partner as to how you will counter such an allegation when it is raised by anyone in general. In fact, see your mom as a societal mirror in this case, and answer the questions she has posed to your satisfaction and then think of polite and convincing ways to respond to anyone who raises the same curious or unsettling issues.

, It may be useful to have a meeting between you, mom and your betrothed. Let your mother pose her questions. Let your fiancé(e) answer. Weigh carefully. Once again, this is your life and future at stake, and you would be wise to consider your mom's opinion, even if you end up with unchanged feelings and plans. At least this way, your mom will feel she got a fair hearing.

, More than that, an issue of pride and/or disappointment has to be overcome - her son or daughter is doing something that she thinks is breaking her heart, so you'll need to stand in her shoes for a time to understand the extent of her pain. Patience is the virtue that will get you through this time of her stubbornness or determination.

, However, don't create divisions. Let people know that you'd appreciate their support for your wedding and for your intended partner. It's their choice to react as they see fit, but seeing their support for you and your future spouse will help your mother to think through her concerns more objectively.


In some cases, it may be helpful to have someone your mom trusts implicitly have a discussion about the marriage with her. This person could point out the opposite side to her objections in a way that is less fraught with emotions than between you and your mom.

, Let your mother (and the entire family) know that you've decided to go ahead and get married. And don't wait - when your mind is entirely made up, make the announcement, and keep it positive. Tell your mother privately that you now intend to declare your intentions to all. If there is any further resistance, at this point, you must take a firm, hard stand. Try to be as minimally harsh as possible, but let your mom know, in no uncertain terms, that the time for voicing her disagreeing opinions is now at an end.


For example: Tell your mom, calmly and kindly, ""Mom, I understand your concerns, you've made them crystal clear. I've heard you out and I haven't changed my opinion. We're getting married. I am not asking for your permission, but I would like your blessing. I hope you can give it.""
At the appointed time, announce clearly, amazingly and happily that you are engaged. Hopefully, Mom will have taken your warning to your heart. As long as mom keeps her mouth shut, be nice. It's all about simply getting along.

, Your partner hasn't caused this - it is your mother's choice to respond in this way. Your partner deserves to know how you are dealing with it and what it means for the day of the wedding, for future life together. Ultimately, your future spouse needs to know that he or she comes first and that you don't agree with her point of view.


Do let your partner know that you still care for your mom and that ultimately, you hope it'll all turn out for the best. That gives both of you an understanding that there is an intention to keep working on your relationship with your mom for the sake of everyone.

Place the promise ring on any finger.",How to Give a Promise Ring," If you are giving a promise ring as a sign of friendship, or to someone you've only recently been dating, pick something simple and inexpensive. If your partner is hoping for a marriage proposal, either use a less culturally significant piece of jewelry or make the decision to exchange promise rings in advance so you don't disappoint them with a misinterpreted surprise.;
, If they don't wear rings, place the ring on a necklace chain or use a different ""promise gift"". Try to find out their ring size by temporarily ""stealing"" a ring and having a jeweler measure it.


If the recipient has a job or hobby that could wear down or scratch the ring (such as construction or rock climbing), select a hard material such as titanium.
If the ring is a promise to become engaged in the future, or a ""wedding ring"" for a couple that doesn't plan on getting married, select a ring that fits on the ring finger of the left hand, or wherever your partner plans to wear a wedding ring.
For most other promise rings, select a ring that fits on any other finger. (Often the ring finger of the right hand, which can be a different size than its left counterpart.)

, Also known as poésy rings, these are metal bands with a love poem, promise, or other inscription engraved on the inside surface, next to the wearer's skin. These are an excellent choice, since they are usually distinguishable from wedding bands and can literally display a promise.


A jeweler can help you make your own posy ring by engraving a personal message from you to the recipient.
Many posy rings quote Bible verses or other Christian inscriptions, but the tradition has expanded to secular society or other religious couples.

, These rings originate in Ireland and depict two clasped hands holding a heart. This visual sign of love or friendship serves as a warm reminder of commitment.

, Most jewelers are willing to design or customize a ring for you by adding special elements, such as engraved messages or unique, significant decorations. Consider engraving the same promise you will make verbally.

, A promise ring shouldn't be so expensive or elaborate that it is mistaken for a wedding ring, but a ring with special significance adds extra weight to the promise. Consider a ring with the recipient's birthstone, or a custom engraving.


If you can't afford to buy jewelry, or if the recipient enjoys less fancy gifts, make your own jewelry or other gift. Use a material or object with special significance in your relationship if possible.
A necklace, earring, or other piece of jewelry is just as good a symbol. This option is especially wise when giving the promise to a partner who is eager for a marriage proposal; you don't want to mislead them.
If you're having trouble deciding, or simply like this idea, ask the recipient if they would like to exchange promise rings, then talk together about selecting a matching pair.

, If it's going to be a surprise, it shouldn't be too obvious you're trying to find out. Consider measuring other rings that already fit, or ask friends and family for help. If you're still unsure, get a ring that can be resized.
, A promise ring might be appropriate as a gift on Christmas, Valentine's Day, or the recipient's birthday. If you're in a relationship, your annual anniversary of dating could be an excellent choice.

, Go to the restaurant you had your first date, the concert hall where you first met your friend, or any place the two of you made a happy memory together. Keep in mind the kind of person the recipient is: some people are comfortable receiving the ring in a crowded place while others prefer somewhere more private.

, This is not a wedding proposal. You don't need to hire a skywriter or organize a flash mob.

, Leave a written clue somewhere the recipient will find it, and have it hint at the location of the next one. Think of clues that only you two can understand. At the end of the chain, you'll be there to present the promise ring.


This kind of elaborate setup can be fun or romantic, but be sure the recipient will react well when they find out it is a promise ring. It may be too early in the relationship for a sign of serious commitment, or conversely your partner may be expecting a proposal.
Keep the clues simple and obvious; the point isn't to confuse them! If the target enjoys puzzles, you can make the clues harder, but have you or a friend follow them sneakily to run in and give them another hint if they get stuck!

, A fun day spending time together is a great way to lead up to a special moment. Consider a hike ending in a picnic, or make a home cooked meal. Organize it in advance to avoid unexpected guests at home or an empty fuel tank on your way back from hiking.


If something unexpected ruins your day together, plan to present the ring a different day.

, Hide the ring somewhere the future wearer will eventually find it, such as under their pillow or inside their lunchbox. This can be part of another setup or stand on its own, depending on how much you want to build up the moment.


If you won't necessarily be there when they find it, include your promise in writing and follow it up with a personal declaration.

, Present the ring or other ""promise gift"" simply by opening a gift box and showing it to her; you don't want it mistaken for a marriage proposal. If you left it somewhere secret for the recipient to find, give them a moment to take it in.

, If there is a specific commitment you're making (such as sobriety or fidelity), announce this clearly as you give the ring. Prepare a few words in advance if you don't want to come up with them spontaneously.



Don't over-promise. Don't say you plan to marry the recipient someday unless you are prepared to follow through. Make your intentions clear, even if they are as simple as a desire to show your love or support.
A quote from a favorite poem or song can lend your declaration extra emotion, but make sure some of the words are your own.

, If you play music, sing, or write poetry, composing a piece that says how you feel can be a touching way to communicate the promise.

, Tell the person how much they mean to you in your own words. Reference specific qualities you admire and specific happy memories to avoid falling into cliché.

, You know your relationship with the recipient better than wikiHow does. If the two of you would find meaning in something goofier than described here, or you know the recipient would love a ten minute sonnet recitation, go with it.

, Most people wear it on the left hand on the middle finger or on the ring finger of the right hand. Most recipients won't want it to be confused with an engagement ring, so stay away from the ring finger on the left hand.


Of course, if you are using a different piece of jewelry or or other gift, place it in the appropriate spot or hand it to them formally.

Peek through her current jewelry to determine her general preferences.,
Use hints, family, and friends to tease out ideas for potential engagement rings.,
Talk to her about alternative stones if you don't think she is interested in diamonds.,
Consider shopping for the ""real ring"" together, getting engaged first.",How to Choose an Engagement Ring1," Choosing a ring is a tricky proposition -- you want to get something she loves, but also keep it a surprise. The best way to do this is to see what other rings and jewelry she loves to wear. You don't have to be an expert in jewelry. Instead, keep your eye out for the following trends:



Style: Does he prefer colorful, vibrant pieces or understated, austere, and traditional styles?

Color: What color stones does she seem to gravitate towards? Does she lean towards color, or does she generally keep things simple in whites, silvers, and golds?

Bands: The band is the metal holding stones in place. Does she aim for silver, gold, or white? Or is she interested in funkier, more out-there designs and materials?

Size: How big are the stones or pieces on most of her jewelry? Does she like smaller, more inconspicuous jewels or big and flashy rings?;
, Even if you take good notes on her current jewelry, many women have particular ideas about their perfect engagement rings. As you get closer to the big question, consider:


Making a comment about a friend's engagement ring and to ask her preferences at the same time. You can say something like, ""I think Mary's engagement ring was a bit flashy. What do you think?""
Asking her family and friends for ideas. Has she talked to them about rings or jewels that she likes?
Determining her stance on diamonds. Is she an impassioned supporter of Fair Trade and human rights? Be sure to look for recycled gold and conflict-free diamonds as part of your choosing process., Diamonds account for almost 90% of all engagement rings sold, but they aren't your only option. Many people, put off by illegal ""blood diamonds,"" the low intrinsic value of diamonds, (which companies artificially inflate), and the relative commonness of a diamond ring have decided on alternative stones. You could consider:



Sapphire: The bright blue stone is the second most common for engagement rings.

Emeralds: Bright green, you want to probably make sure she's into the color before buying.

Colored Diamonds: Yes, it is still a diamond, but yellow, black, and rose-tinted diamonds give a unique flair to the ring while still staying somewhat traditional., When you're spending so much money on a ring, you want to make sure she'll like it. More and more frequently, men are proposing without a ring, or with a simple engagement band, and then shopping for the actual ring as a couple. This ensures that she gets the ring she wants without all the pressure of picking something so expensive by yourself. Guys don't normally buy jewelry and are generally less equipped to tell a woman's taste. So work together!

Use the Gray Method for unborn children and children up to age four.,
Measure the heights of the father and mother.,
For a female child, reduce the father's height by one-thirteenth (12/13 of actual height).,
Add the adjusted height of one parent to the non-adjusted height of the other.,
Divide the sum by two to estimate the child's final height.,
Put it all together.,
Use simpler variations, if preferred.",How to Predict Height1," It involves combining the parents’ heights, adjusting for child gender (the Mid-Parent Rule), and dividing by two.


This method derives from a 1948 article by Horace Gray in the journal Child Development,and is still in widespread use today.
The margin of error is +/- 4 inches, which may seem like a large amount (consider the difference of ending up either 5'2"" or 5'10""), but is indicative of the difficulty of accurately predicting height in the face of so many variables.;
, The method works in either inches or centimeters.

, For a male child, increase the mother's height by one-thirteenth (13/12 of actual height).For instance, if the father of a female child is 69 inches, multiply by 12, then divide by 13, for an adjusted result of 63.7 inches.
Likewise, if the mother of a male child is 63 inches, multiply by 13, then divide by 12, for an adjusted result of 68.3 inches.

, In the instance of a female child, with a father at 69 inches (adjusted to 63.7) and a mother at 63 inches, the sum is 126.7 inches. For a male child, the sum is 69 in. (father) + 68.3 in. (adjusted mother) = 137.3 inches.

, Using the examples in the last step, example 1 (female child) is 126.7 / 2 = 63.4 inches, and example 2 (male child) is 137.3 / 2 = 68.7 inches.

, Thus, a female child whose father is 69 inches tall and mother is 63 inches tall is predicted to reach 63.4 inches (5'3""). Likewise, a male child with parents the same height is predicted to reach 68.7 inches (5'9"").


The formulas: ((69 x 12 / 13) + 63) / 2 = 63.3 ; (69 + (63 x 13 / 12)) / 2 = 68.7 .
There are also websites that will do the calculations for you if you enter the required heights.Remember that with the range of accuracy in this method, the female child in the example above could reasonably expect to reach between 59.3 and 67.3 inches, based on assorted genetic and environmental factors.

, There are variations to the Gray Method that skip the 12/13 adjustment and simply add then divide by 2 the parents' heights, then add 3 or 5 inches for a male child or subtract 3 or 5 inches for a female child.The results end up roughly similar to the original method.


Thus, for a female child, ((69 + 63) / 2) - 3 = 63 inches, or ((69 +63) / 2) -5 = 61 inches.
Or, for a male child, ((69 + 63) / 2) + 3 = 69 inches, or ((69 + 63) / 2) + 5 = 71 inches.

Choose the right metal for the band.,
Choose the right style band for your partner, from fresh and funky to simple and traditional.,
Consider the ""setting,"" or how the stone will be set in the band.,
Choose the right size.",How to Choose an Engagement Ring2," The band is the circular part of the ring that sits around the finger. It's usually made from gold, silver, or platinum, although it can be made from some other combination of metals. Note that, since metals rub and wear on one another, you should only wear rings of the same metal next to each other. Look at her existing jewelry collection to get an idea of what she prefers, differentiating from the three most common metals:



Gold is yellow-orange in its natural state and is normally alloyed with another metal for durability. Some prefer the lighter yellow color of less pure gold such as 14K or 10K, as the yellow reflection will slightly tint the diamond.

White gold is gold alloyed with metals purposely to give the mixture an off-white color, it and must be plated with another metal--rhodium is common--for a bright silvery appearance. This plating wears off -- but some jewelers will replace their rings from time to time for free if you ask in advance.

Platinum is hard, strong and naturally silvery, but will dull slightly over time with wear, which is not necessarily a problem. Since a gold setting will make a diamond look very slightly yellowish, it is a waste of money to buy a very high color grade diamond to put in it.

Silver is less common, but also less expensive. It is usually alloyed with something else to hold strength and shine., Once you know the right metal, you still have some options with the band. You often have a bewildering number of choices -- from classic, plain bands to twisted, wrapped, or other unique band designs.


Do you want other stones inset into the band or just metal?
Do you want a thick band showing off more stones/metal, or a thin band?

, The setting refers to the piece that holds the gemstone in place on the band. The setting can be ""pronged"" or ""invisible"".A setting with a bezel, or at least six prongs for some redundancy, is safer for a ring that is worn during significant activity, though some women may prefer less metal in the way of their stone.

, Choosing the ring size of the band is an important part of choosing the right engagement ring. One way you can figure out her ring size is by sneaking out one of the rings she wears a lot to have a jeweler figure out the size -- as long as she doesn't have time to miss it. If you can't get a ring out, try:


Tracing the inside of the ring on a piece of paper, then using that for sizing.
Placing the ring on your finger, then marking with pen or sharpie how far up it slides."
"
Know your diamonds.,
Choose the right cut, or shape, of the diamond.,
Use ""karats"" to determine the weight or general size.,
Consider if you want a clear or colored diamond.,
Keep an eye on the diamond's clarity.,
Don't forget about the practicality of the ring.",How to Choose an Engagement Ring3," Diamonds tend to be the traditional engagement ring choice because they are enduring and match everything. Only deviate from a diamond if you know that your girlfriend loves another stone much, much more, or has voiced her intense dislike of diamonds. When choosing a diamond, be aware of the following 4 C's of diamonds.


Cut
Carats
Color
Clarity

, There are different ways to cut a diamond and the type of cut impacts a diamond's sparkle. The cut that produces the most sparkle is the ""round"" (or ""brilliant"") cut, while ""radiant"" and ""princess"" cuts are good at hiding flaws. Other cuts include ""square,"" ""emerald,"" ""pear,"" ""marquise,"" ""cushion,"" ""Asscher,"" and heart-shaped.The oval shape looks best with larger stones, and as it looks bigger than the round cut.A high-quality cut is more important than weight or an extremely high clarity or color grade: a diamond, like a road reflector, shines light back out the direction it came in and breaks it up a bit in the process.


It is also important to base your selection of diamonds based on objective data such as ASET or Idealscope images that you can acquire from your jeweler.This is particularly important if you are buying a diamond engagement ring online

, Karats refer to the unit measurement of the diamond, and refers to weight, rather than size. Karats are broken down into 100 ‘points’, which are essentially a measurement of the percentage of a karat that a diamond is. For example, if a diamond is 75pt then it is 75%, or 0.75 of a karat. Higher karat ratings generally mean larger diamonds and are more expensive., The color of diamonds varies considerably and most people prefer a white colored diamond for an engagement ring. Colors are graded from D (colorless and rare) and most good quality diamonds will be around F and H. However, all grades from D to I are almost identical when mounted.In general, stay away from any diamonds that are below an H grade in color, as they are noticeably yellow.

, Because diamonds are formed naturally, there are imperfections in nearly all diamonds. These are known as ‘inclusions’ and come from tiny impurities being present when the diamond was formed, millions of years ago. The fewer imperfections, the greater the clarity and the more light is reflected from the diamond, causing it to ""sparkle"". Naturally, more clarity increases its value. Perfectly flawless diamonds with no internal flaws or surface blemishes are very hard to find as they are extremely rare.


The scale used to grade clarity goes from F1 for a flawless diamond, to VVS1 and VVS2 for very slight inclusions, to VS1 and VS2 for very slight inclusions, SI1 and SI2 for slight inclusions and I1, I2 and I3 for imperfect diamonds.
Diamonds are magnified by 10 times to judge their clarity so very slight imperfections are difficult to see with the naked eye. This means that there is a range of diamonds available even for more modest budgets. If you can see a mark without magnification, however, think carefully before you buy.

, If your girlfriend is a real outdoorsy type, consider a ring that is able to cope with the wear and tear of constant activities. The higher the positioning of the gemstone on the ring, the easier it is for it to get caught on clothes, gear, hair, etc. and the greater likelihood that it'll get knocked about. Look for a lower gemstone setting for an active girl, and a higher setting for a fashionista or glamor girl.

"
"
Fix your budget in advance.,
Choose a good jeweler, considering online sources as well.,
Ask for a certificate of authenticity and a warranty to accompany the ring.,
Get the ring insured.",How to Choose an Engagement Ring4," There is a tradition that holds that a man should spend two months of his salary on the engagement ring, but this is a foolish, baseless rule. You should by the best ring you can afford without going into debt, setting a budget early on and working from there. Some ways to save money without sacrificing quality include:


Stay just shy of common karat sizes, like 1 or 2 karats. A 1.9 karat stone is not noticeably different, but can save you as much as 20%.
Aim for a wider cut, which can make a smaller stone look bigger.
Check out antique stones and rings instead of buying a brand new piece -- it has flavor, uniqueness, and can be much cheaper., Look for a store that makes you feel comfortable and where the staff is pleasant and helpful. If you can, check that the jeweler is registered with a society, association, or organization that regulates, certifies, etc., jewelers, such as the National Association of Goldsmiths in the UK. Furthermore, don't be afraid of online jewelers -- you can save as much as 100% compared to a chain like Kay's:


Ask around your married friends or your family for recommendations on a good, trusted jeweler.
An online jeweler such as James Allen, Harry George or Blue Nile can be a good option if you're willing to accept a little less ""hand-holding"" for a better price. Be sure to check that the jeweler has a strong online reputation before purchasing by searching ""(Name of online jeweler) + Reviews"" on Google.

, Certificates are very useful to collect with a diamond to find out exactly where they originated from. They are usually only available with the purchase of diamonds larger or at 1 karat. For smaller diamonds, a certificate adds a considerable amount to the cost of the stone, as you may end up paying an extra several hundred dollars or pounds to obtain one.


For more expensive rings, a certificate is a near necessity to ensure your valuable new stone retains it's worth.

, The ring is likely to be the most expensive piece of jewelry you have ever bought, and the most expensive piece of jewelry your fiancé has ever worn. To prevent her from losing it to appraisal and insurance when she's just getting used to wearing it, get it all done before you pop the question. Be sure to check that your insurance covers its loss, or ask for insurance from the jeweler's store if available.

Double the height of a female child at 18 months or a male at 2 years.,
Employ the Khamis-Roche Method.,
Have the child’s “bone age” determined by x-ray.",How to Predict Height2," This is probably the simplest method possible, based strictly on the child’s height at an early age.For instance, a female child who is 32 inches at 18 months would be predicted to reach 64 inches (5’4”), while a male child who is 36 inches at 2 years would be predicted to reach 72 inches (6').
The +/- 4 inch margin of error stands for this method as well.

, This method derives from a 1994 journal article,and relies on a more complex scaling of equations based on six factors: sex of the child; mother’s height; father’s height; child’s height; child’s weight; and child’s age.


This method is recommended for children ages 4 and above.
Unless you really want to test your math skills, rely on a website calculator to make this determination.For example, a 40-inch, 45-pound, 4-year old female child, with a mother at 63 inches and father at 69 inches, is predicted to reach 63 inches (5’3”).
The 90% margin of error for this method is approximately 2 inches, meaning 90% of children with the above criteria would reach between 61 and 65 inches.

, This method originated in 1959,and has been updated several times.It involves taking an x-ray of the child’s left hand, fingers, and wrist, and using a comparison of bone age to chronological age.


This one is obviously not a do-at-home prediction method. Discuss your interest in this method with your child’s physician.
This method is considered somewhat (but not substantially) more accurate than the Khamis-Roche Method.

"
"
Use what is sometimes called the “Lauren Method” for females age 8-16 and males age 9-18.Khamis-Roche and bone age methods can also be used for children in this age range.,
Temper your expectations, even for older children.",How to Predict Height3,"


Released in 2005,this method utilizes the child’s sex, date of birth, date of test, height, sitting height, and weight.
There are online calculators for this method as well.
For example, a female child born May 5, 2003; tested May 5, 2015; height 63 inches; sitting height 49 inches; weight 120 pounds; can expect to reach 64.7 inches (5’5”).

, Even these methods used on teenagers who are nearing their final heights retain a margin of error. There are so many factors in final height that no prediction method can be entirely accurate. Growth spurts vary in occurrence and duration, environmental factors can change, and so on. The only way to know for sure is to wait and see.

Offer your congratulations.,
Send a card.,
Obtain an engagement present.,
Get to know your friend's partner.,
Accept the wedding invitation.,
Help organize the stag and hen nights or bachelor/bachelorette parties.,
Decide what to wear.,
If for any reason you can't attend, then send a card with a message of best wishes.

",How to Be Supportive when Your Friend Gets Engaged," When your friend first announces her or his engagement, she or he is likely to be very excited. It's a big moment in anyone's life, and it is normally important to the newly-betrothed that their friends and family share in their joy. When your friend first tells you her or his plans, be happy for her or him and offer your congratulations. Hugs, kisses, tears and laughter are all appropriate. Hopefully this will come naturally!;
, If you can't be with your friend in person, send her or him a card to let them know you are thinking of her or him. Address it to both your friend and her or his partner, and write a short personal message inside.


Personalise the card by adding a picture of the couple when they first met, before they got together or even a picture of your friend as a child, perhaps dressing up as a bride or groom or at a moment of success, like winning a medal.

, You might like to give your friend a present to help celebrate her or his engagement. Champagne is sometimes a good option. Alternatively you could club together with some friends to treat the couple to an experience they can share together, like a weekend at a fancy hotel.


Respect any beliefs that your friend or their partner may have about proper boundaries before the marriage.

, Now that your friend has decided to marry, it will be more important than ever that her or his friends and her or his partner get to know each other. If you haven't already done so, make the effort to get to know your friend's new spouse-to-be. Treat them as a unit by inviting them to things together.


If for some reason you really can't stand the new partner, then you need to put in a bit of extra work. Try organizing group events to invite them to; that way you can get to know the partner without having to speak to him or her all the time. Remember that meeting the friends can be a nerve-wracking experience, so the partner could be acting out of character due to nerves. Give it time. You friend obviously sees something in this person, so he or she can't be all bad!

, At some point during the engagement you will (hopefully) receive an official invitation to the wedding. The wedding day is traditionally hosted by the parents of the bride, and so the invitation will often be sent on their behalf. They will often request an RSVP by a certain date. The invitation may instruct you on how to do this, but if not you should reply by writing a short letter to the address on the invitation.

, If you are best man or maid of honor, it is traditionally your responsibility to organize the ""last night of the freedom bang"" before marriage. Apart from the logistics, you also have the responsibility of looking after the bride or groom on the big night. You need to walk a fine line between making sure they have a party they will never forget, and stitching them up completely. You should bear in mind though that their partner will hold you responsible for their loved one's safety and well being, and will appreciate any lasting damage or permanent tattoos.

, You've been invited to share the most important day in your friend's life, so you should make an effort to look your best. Start planning early so you can dress smartly.


Men should wear a suit and tie.
Women should take the opportunity to wear a dress. Alternatively they could wear a nice top and skirt or trousers. Avoid wearing white or the colour of the bridal party.
Make an effort with your outfit. Weddings can vary from very formal to very casual. As a general rule of thumb, jeans are a no no. If you would wear it clubbing or to work, it's not appropriate for the wedding.

, Simply engaging in conversation with a young child can reveal multitudes about his or her personality. You can discover whether she likes to play soccer, read, play with Barbie dolls, or jump rope by just asking her what her hobbies are.

, Begin doing something you suspect may be interesting to a child (like Play-doh). Most children are very curious and will eventually gravitate toward you if they see you doing something interesting. If the child is under age of four, most activities will appear fun as long as you are smiling!

, The great outdoors is a fabulous place for children to play. Suggest a day at the park or community swimming pool. It is safe to say that the majority of children are thrilled to go swimming. Just be sure to provide the proper supervision levels, depending on the child's age (a two-year-old requires constant supervision, while a 12-year-old can fend for himself with intermediate supervision).

, Children seem to find nothing more amusing than adults clambering over themselves or running into sliding glass doors. My younger sister gets a kick out of fall-down videos, and many children agree!

, Disney movies never fail, and it is a sure thing that a child will have a favorite picked out.

, Most of us love the experience of going to the movie theater, enjoying popcorn and candy, and watching a movie. Children are no exception. Treat them to a film you know they would enjoy,but make sure it is appropriate for children.

, When walking, there is nothing more heartfelt or affectionate than when a child unexpectedly reaches for your hand while strolling down the street. Don't pull away if a young child does this. It means he/she likes you!

, As mentioned above, most children love anything Disney, and are very particular about which movies they prefer. Drive to the mall and let them get lost amongst the endless piles of limited edition Disney Beanie Babies!

, Dr. Seuss works every time! Whimsical yet highly educational, don't worry if you stumble over words when you read aloud. Dr. Seuss provides a fun way to bond with a child while simultaneously improving your pronunciation skills. Try the Lorax!

, Children can be very bashful, but they can also be extraordinarily outspoken. Don't be afraid to approach a child simply because he is shy. He will open up to you, but you might have to wait a little bit.

, Coloring books are fun for kids and adults alike. Teach your young friend how to color inside the lines, and she will teach you the importance of staying outside the lines!

, Children love animals. If your dog is child-friendly, it is certain that your young companion will love him. Just make sure to clear it with the parents before you bring your dog over for a visit.

, Nothing evokes more awe and excitement in a child than being surrounded by an underwater environment. She will frolic among the fish for hours while you breathlessly try to keep up with her.

, Young children are just as fragile, if not more so, than adults when it comes to emotions. Maintain an honest relationship with a child, even when they upset you, but keep in mind that a child's mind is tender as well as malleable. Refrain from cussing or engaging in behavior you wouldn't want the child to emulate.

, Children don't do well with rigid structure. Learn to go with the flow, and you will have fulfilling and exciting interactions with young children!

Check your bank account.,

Ask your partner.,
Ask your partner about their concerns.,

Seek couple’s counseling.",How to Decide Whether or Not to Have a Baby," Many biological and cultural factors may contribute to the desire to have a child. However, rather than bending to immediate pressure, take time to decide whether you have the capacity to care for a child in your home for the next 18 years, as well as helping to support it throughout your life.


Understand that having a baby is not simply a time commitment. Raising a child is currently estimated to cost a quarter of a million dollars before college.Know that a child is a mental investment, as well. Studies report that new parents experience a loss of happiness that is on par with divorce and unemployment. While happiness does eventually pick up again, consider your own mental health and whether you are presently in a place to handle that level of extended mental hardship.;
, Some people may become motivated to have children after major life events or even during crises. Look at what else has happened or is currently happening in your life to see if it may be giving you temporary motivation.


Some couples are led to believe that having a child may save a hurting relationship. While there is no guarantee either way, the pressure of raising children often hurts damaged relationships more than it helps.Some couples feel that having children is simply the next step after marriage. There is no inherently right time to start having children, so check in with yourself and your spouse to see if it is what you both want or whether you should take time and revisit the conversation later in your relationship.
Sometimes a major life event such as recovering from a serious illness or injury might fuel someone to start making the most of their life immediately. It is not bad to have a baby after a life event, but take time to think over the long term implications along with the short term rush.

, If you grew up believing that parenthood was the only option once you grew up, take a moment and consider what it would mean for your life if you did not have children. This is simply an exercise, not a final decision, but picture what type of work, relationships, hobbies, and personal interests you might pursue if you did not have a child.Ask yourself, “Does any of this feel better to me than the option of bringing up a family?” Take note of your instinctual reaction.
If there is something in your mind that does seem as appealing as parenthood, check with yourself to see if that option and raising a child truly are exclusive. How might you be able to work that career, hobby, or relationship into your life as a parent?

, Remember that you have no obligation to have children if you don’t want them. Likewise, as long as you are legally an adult in your homeland, you have no obligation to abstain from having children if you do want them. Look around you and see if anyone is pressuring you to make this decision.If you and your partner are not on the same page about children, stop momentarily and ask yourself, “Am I considering this new stance because I am seeing things differently, or am I trying to make my partner happy?”
Look at your friends and family. Have any of them been pressuring you one way or the other? If so, you may opt to keep your distance from them until you make your decision.

, Before you decide whether you want a child, take a look to see if you’re healthy enough to have a child. If you have a chronic condition, be it physical or mental, ask yourself, “How might this impact my child as I get older?”


Meet with your doctor. Let them know, “I am considering having a child, and I want to know if my health might have any long term impacts on my ability to parent.”
Women must also be aware that certain biological factors may impact how likely they are to get pregnant, as well as how likely they are to carry the pregnancy to term. Ask your doctor for a preconception visit to evaluate any potential complications that may come up during your pregnancy.If you have a history of anxiety, depression, or other mental health complications, meet with a mental health professional and let them know, “I want to have a child. What impact could my mental health struggles have on me as a parent?”

, You don’t need the whole quarter of a million in the bank before you have your kid, but you should make sure that you are able to meet your child’s foreseeable financial needs.First, make sure you can afford the time off work. If paid parental leave is not a part of your benefits program, make sure you can afford reduced income for the amount of time you or your partner will take off after the child is born.
Look at health care costs. Once you decide to have a baby, you and your partner are going to have to start paying for the expectant mother’s medical care, which may range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending upon insurance programs and care received.You are also going to have to take care of any medical complications the child may experience after birth, and add the child on as a new insurance dependent.
Consider how much it will cost to supply a new baby. Cribs, baby clothes, car seats, and other objects all come with a price, and items like diapers and baby food represent a recurrent expense that may add tens to hundreds a month in expense.Look into the cost of daycare as well. This may be necessary if you cannot afford to let one partner stay home with the baby while the other partner is at work.

, If you plan on being a working parent, now is the time to think about where your career is going.Meet with your boss to discuss current and near future plans for your company and your position, and ask yourself:


Does your job require long hours or a lot of travel?
Are you working on a major project that might require excess time or attention?
Would having a child result in excess childcare costs due to career obligations?
Does your company offer paid parental leave or other benefits for new parents?

, The bulk of raising a child falls on the parents or guardians, but a good support system will benefit both the parents and the child in the long run. Look at your friends, family, and colleagues and ask yourself if you see them having a positive impact on your child’s life.Look for people who are not only willing to offer emotional understanding, but who will actually help with matters such as babysitting and housekeeping in order to ease the transition into parenthood.
If you do not have an integrated support system already established, ask yourself if you have the financial means to hire support staff such as nannies or housekeepers.

, If you haven’t already, now is the time to sit down with your partner and discuss whether or not they want kids. Let them know, “I have been considering whether I want to have a child recently and I want to talk to you about whether you see yourself as a parent.”


Find a good time to talk. Don’t spring the question on them randomly or when they are dealing with other matters. Instead, ask them to set aside a certain time so that you can have a serious conversation.
Explain your reasons for considering having children. Let them know what reasons you have for wanting children, as well as what reason you have for not wanting them.
Ask your partner for their opinion, and respectfully consider what they have to say.

, Once you and your partner have discussed if both of you want children, allow them to go through the same mental process of evaluation. Allow them to voice their concerns as well as their hopes.


Actively ask questions such as, “How do you see financially preparing for a child?” and “Do you think we have a good enough support network to care for a child?”
Avoid disagreements. Allow your partner to voice their own thoughts. If you see something differently, politely offer your opinion by saying, “I’ve been thinking about it this way.” Don’t, however, make your partner feel invalidated during this conversation.

, Decide how the two of you would work together to parent your child. Would you both be involved, or would one of you simply be donating your genes? Would you raise the child together in a single household, or would the child split its time between the two of you individually?Ask your partner, “How do you see us raising this child?” Understand that answers different from your personal preference are not necessarily wrong, and discuss any difference of opinion with an open mind.
Talk to your partner about behavioral expectations.Since you have not been a parent before, you might not know how you will handle every situation. However, you might have some ideas. Try starting a conversation with your partner about your expectations, such as by saying something like, “""I see us splitting nightly feeding duties evenly.""

, Work with a counselor to help you and your partner communicate clearly and effectively regarding your hopes and concerns for becoming parents. Use this time to not only decide if you both want a baby, but to bolster your relationship prior to bringing a child into it.Let your counselor know, “We are thinking about having a child and we want to make sure our relationship is healthy ready for the challenges of parenting.”
Consider talking with a family counselor, as well as a couple’s counselor.

If your child is under three, keep all choking hazards out of reach and possibly locked away.",How to Child Proof Your Home," To prevent your child from sticking their finger or any other objects in an outlet, use protective coverings.;
, Make sure all of your household chemicals are out of reach and hidden from plain sight. If necessary, you can purchase shelve and cabinet locks or child-proof caps for the chemicals.

, Even children's medication should be kept out of reach, as they can overdose on this just as easily as adult medication. The only exception would be if the child has a medical condition which requires them to carry certain medications on them in case of emergencies. Other than that, keep all medications out of children's reach and make sure the bottles have child-proof caps.

, Install safety gates that are up-to-date with current safety standards. Use safety gates at doorways that lead to stairs, basements, attics, and other places in your home that could be unsafe for your children.

, Any tables, desks, dressers, and any other large furniture should be anchored down with an anchor strap to avoid the furniture tipping or falling over if the child climbs on it.

, If you have a swimming pool, buy a cover that you can strap down to prevent your child from falling into the pool.

, Make sure your yard is fenced so your child doesn't run off anywhere. If you have any ponds outside, use a fence or gate to prevent your child from accessing it.

, Make sure any house-hold devices are properly stored in an area inaccessible to your child.

, Keep all breakable items away and out of reach of your children's hands, especially any glass objects.

, Protect your child by covering corners and edges of furniture with foam to prevent any injuries.

, To prevent any drowning, close all toilet lids(You can can also purchase toilet-lid locks to restrict your child from opening the toilet lid) and don't leave water in bathtubs or buckets.

, A child could turn on the water and burn themselves in hot water. If you live in an apartment and can't completely change the water setting, just turn the faucet onto the cold setting., Remember, if the toy or item can fit through a toilet paper tube, it is a choking hazard. Some common choking hazards to keep out of reach and locked away are: marbles, buttons, pins, crayons, paper clips, beads, rubber bands, and tiny doll shoes."

Cordless window coverings, such as “honeycomb”-style blinds, are not only safer for children, but provide great insulation for your home as well.If you have cords on your window blinds, shades or curtains, cut them off or use cord shorteners, safety tassels, or wind-ups to keep them out of reach.
Since November, 2000, all window blinds sold in the United States are required to come with attachments on the pull cords to prevent a loop from forming between the slats if a child pulls on them. If you purchased window blinds were bought before this date, you should call (800) 506-4636 to order a free retrofit kit.;
, Window guards have bars that are about 4 inches (10 cm) apart, and will keep children from falling from an open window. They screw into the sides of the window frame itself. Safety netting will prevent falls from balconies or decks.Check regularly to make sure that the guards and netting are still secure.
You can find both window guards and safety netting at most retail hardware stores.

, If a window opens from the top, then it will be out of reach for a child to push his way through the screen. If it opens from the bottom, you should put a window guard on it to make sure it only goes up 3 inches, or the distance of an adult fist.If you have a window seat, or a window that reaches low to the ground, it’s particularly important that you install a window guard to prevent accidents.
For casement windows, you should remove the crank and put it somewhere you can find it, but your child can’t.

, Using outlet plates are recommended over outlet covers, which a curious toddler will notice you removing whenever you need to access the outlet. In an outlet plate, sliding covers allow an adult to access the outlet when needed, while protecting a child against accidental injury.If you have a lot of wires in your child’s room, it’s a good idea to conceal them in a wire guard when you’re childproofing the room.
Reserve the plastic outlet covers for rarely used outlets, or outlets that are typically out-of-reach.

, Round and levered doorknobs can easily be fitted with door knob covers and locks that will prevent a child from opening a door and accessing the rest of the house.A “door monkey” will allow a door to open a few inches, but will prevent a child from leaving.
Make sure your cabinets won’t slam on tiny fingers by installing pinch guards. These are U-shaped pieces of foam that prevent a door from closing.

, If you’re hosting a child in your home, you may not have access to commercial door guards. You can always use a simple washcloth or similar material to keep a door closed.As you close the door, hold the washcloth between the door and the door frame on the same side as the door handle.
You’ll be able to close the door, and the washcloth will stay in place. The extra pressure against the door will prevent a child from opening the door.
When you need to get in or out, pull the washcloth tight with one hand, and turn the knob with the other. You should be able to open the door without too much effort.

, Cut a piece of cardboard about 3 inches wide and long enough to wrap around your doorknob. Press it around your round doorknob, and tape the two ends of the cardboard together. Duct tape or another strong tape will be most effective.When the child tries to turn the doorknob, the only thing she’ll be able to grasp will be the cardboard. The cardboard will spin around the knob without turning the knob.
This strategy won’t work on levered knobs.

, Best safety practice is to post a smoke alarm in every bedroom in your home, including a child’s room. If you have multiple stories in your home, you should also make sure that at least one smoke alarm can be found on each floor.It’s a good idea to check the batteries monthly, and replace your smoke detectors once a year.

, Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that is extremely toxic. Every home should have at least one CO alarm to alert you for its presence, so that you can leave the house safely.Carbon monoxide alarms can be purchased at most hardware stores.
Change the batteries in your CO alarm at the same time you change the ones in your smoke detector. Some smoke detectors come equipped to alert you to both smoke and CO.

, Make sure your space heaters are never placed close to a bed, window coverings, newspapers, or other household furnishings. Heaters should always be kept at least 3 feet (1 meter) away from anything potentially flammable.Avoid putting a space heater where your child or a pet could accidentally knock it over.
Carefully read the product manual that comes with your space heater before using it. Unsafe use of any heater can cause hazardous conditions.

, Toddlers can easily mistake bedroom furniture for jungle gyms. As a result, a child can tip over a heavy chest-of-drawers, resulting in injury. To keep this from happening, anchor the heavy bedroom furniture (such as bureaus, changing tables, etc.) to the wall or to the floor.You can find strong nylon straps (such as Mommy's Helper Tip-Resistant Furniture Safety Brackets) that anchor furniture to the walls. These are screwed into your wall studs, and attached to your furniture
Brackets and braces can also be used to secure furniture in place to prevent it from falling.

, Coins present choking hazards to children, who may not know not to put coins in their mouths. If you’ve got a ceramic piggy bank in your child’s room, realize that it could easily break open, resulting in spilled coins as well as broken ceramic shards.Plastic coins also present choking hazards. Watch out for coin-sized game tokens that older siblings might accidentally leave in a younger child’s room.
Children can choke on smaller pieces of crayon, whether crushed underfoot or broken in two. To prevent children from accidentally getting crayons stuck in their throats, use only larger sized, chubby round crayons.

, Balloons (either uninflated or popped) can become choking hazards for children younger than age 8, and so it’s recommended to keep them out of children’s bedrooms. A child who puts a popped balloon into his mouth can easily suffocate.Anything that fits through the core of a toilet paper roll can be considered a choking hazard.
Any plastic bag, including dry cleaning bags, ziplock bags, and grocery bags should be kept out of reach of a child.

, Toy boxes lure children to open them, but heavy lids will easily fall on an unwary child’s head, arm or fingers. Keeping children’s toys in a toy box without a lid will prevent these accidents from happening.If you need to cover the toys to keep them out of your child’s visual attention, use a piece of cloth or a lightweight covering.
Plastic lids are ideal for toys boxes, because they can be snapped into place. If a child accidentally gets access to the box, the lid won’t be heavy enough to cause injury.

, Safe design on a crib means that the slats are no more than 2 3/8 inches apart. A good rule of thumb to see if the slats are safe is whether or not you can fit a soda can in between them. If a soda can can fit between the slats, so can a child’s head.Look for the Safety Certification Seal of the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (JPMA). This certification label should appear on your baby’s crib.
Its mattress should fit snugly, with no more than 2 adult fingers of space between the edge of the mattress and the slats of the crib.
Make sure the crib doesn’t have any decorative cutouts in the headboard or footboard that a baby could get caught in.

, Check all surfaces to make sure they’re smooth, sanded (if wooden) and free from sharp or jagged, and splinters. The sides should latch securely. All screws should be close fitted to the surface, and there shouldn’t be any missing that might be found by your child.Make sure the crib doesn’t have an missing or broken slats.
Check to see that the sides can’t be released by a child inside the crib.
If the child is tall enough to stand, make sure the crib’s mattress is kept at its lowest position to minimize risk of falling out of the crib.

, Blankets, soft toys, comforters, and pillows (adult pillows, throw pillows, or infant donut pillows) shouldn’t be kept in the crib, as they may result in accidental suffocation for very young children. The mattress should be firm and flat.If your baby needs certain items to fall asleep, take them away once she’s soundly asleep.
Avoid using crib bumpers. A child can climb up on top of crib bumpers and fall out of his crib once he’s old enough.
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies sleep in warm sleepwear with feet instead of a blanket, to prevent risk of suffocation.

, A mobile is entertaining and helps develop vision in young babies, but you need to make sure it’s positioned at a safe distance from the baby’s grasping fingers.When a baby begins to push up on his hands and knees, or by 5 months, you should remove the mobile altogether.
Once a baby can reach the mobile with his fingers, it becomes a strangulation risk.

, You’ll want to make sure that the area immediately around a child’s crib is free of anything that the child could accidentally grab ahold of, such as lamps, wall decorations (including stick-on decals that could fall off the wall and into the crib), cords, and furniture your baby might climb on.Make sure the crib isn’t located near a heating source, such as a vent or radiator.
A child spends a lot of unsupervised time in his crib, so extra attention to safety ahead of time is needed.

Ask your child to stand against a wall.,
Place a flat object against the top of your child’s head.,
Mark your child’s height.,
Use a tape measure to determine how tall your child is.,
Record the measurement.",How to Know if Your Child's Height Is Normal1," Have your child stand up straight against a wall. The ground should be flat and uncarpeted to get the most accurate reading. Make sure that your child’s heels are together and touching the wall.


If you have not done so already, remove your child’s shoes so that they do not affect your child’s height. You should also remove any hair ornaments or braids that could get in the way of the measurement.;
, You can use a hardcover book or a stiff ruler to do this. Position yourself so that your eyes are about level with the top of your child’s head. Gently press the flat object against the top of your child’s head, being sure that the object makes a right angle with the wall.

, Use a pencil to make a small mark on the wall where the underside of the flat object touches. Remove the book and then repeat the measurement. The marks should be no more than ¼ of an inch apart.


If you don’t want to mark up your walls, you can also tape a piece of paper to the wall and make a mark on that instead.

, Have you child hold the end of a tape measure on the floor level and measure up to the marks you made.


Make sure to hold the tape measure straight so that you are not measuring at an angle.

, Keep track of the measurement so that you can use it for comparison the next time you measure your child. Try to record the measurement to the closest 1/8 inch or 0.1 centimeter.


Take the average of the two marks that you made.

You will put one marshmallow on the table where the child is sitting.,
Leave the room once the child understands that he/she either gets to eat one marshmallow now or two later.

,
Wait.,
Return and reward the child with an extra marshmallow if deserved.,
Enjoy watching the video recording of the test with your whole family, and with the child when he or she gets older.",How to Give the Marshmallow Test," In the academic experiment, researchers hid behind a two way mirror. You can accomplish the same thing with a video camera or a webcam in your computer.;
, Explain that you are going to leave the room and that he/she is welcome to eat the marshmallow while you are gone. However, if you return and he/she hasn't eaten the marshmallow, you will reward him/her with an additional marshmallow.

,, In the actual experiment, the psychologists waited up to 20 minutes to see if the children could resist the temptation. However, in this fun version of the test, most parents will prefer to only wait 2-5 minutes.

, Allow him/her to now eat both marshmallows. Explain that you are proud of him/her for being patient. If the child ate the marshmallow while you were gone, try to use the moment for teaching about delayed gratification.

, The kids will enjoy seeing their reaction regardless of how the test goes.

Figure out what shows are appropriate for your child.,
Be sure that your child has an interest in the television show.,
Note that there are short ""segments"" between shows.",How to Enjoy Disney Junior with Your Child," Almost all of the Disney Junior shows have songs or their characters singing. ""The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" always ends episodes with the ""Hot-Dog Song"" where the characters dance on their platforms. ""Little Einsteins"" has sing-along ditties set to the tune of classical music.;
, Characters look at the screen and ask questions pertaining to a situation or if they can do something with the character, for example, count things or sing along with them. At these times, ask and encourage the child to interact back. Try to teach them along with the characters.

, While ""Guess How Much I Love You"", ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"", and ""Goldie and Bear"" can be amusing to a toddler who is 18 to 36 months old, ""Little Einsteins"", ""Doc McStuffins"", and ""Sofia the First"" may be more enjoyable to a three to five year old.

, Don't watch a show because you think it'll be good and enjoyable for them. If something else distracts them, try to find something that they'll have fun with.

, These segments include short and peppy music videos or educational messages. ""Lou and Lou: Safety Patrol"" teaches kids a wide variety of information, ranging from strangers to accidents.

Get a height chart that lists the average height of children that are your child’s age.,
Mark down your child’s height and age on the chart.,
Compare your child’s height to the curves of the chart.,
Keep in mind that your child’s growth may not follow the usual pattern.,
Measure your child every two to four months.,
Know when to contact a doctor about your child’s growth.",How to Know if Your Child's Height Is Normal2," There are charts that graph the average height of children at certain ages. These charts can tell you how your child’s height compares to the average population. Select a chart that covers your child’s age and gender.You can find these charts online, or you can ask your child’s doctor if they have a chart that they can give you.

, You should see a graph on the page that you have selected. The left hand side of the graph should be labeled ‘Stature (height)’ in both inches and centimeters. The bottom of the chart should be marked ‘Age’ (in years).To make your mark:


Place a mark next to your child’s height and draw a line across the chart. Find your child’s age, make a mark and draw a line upwards (vertical) until it crosses your first line. This is your child’s height percentile.

, Notice that the percentile curves are labeled on the upper right. You will have to estimate if the mark that represents your child is between the curves.


If your child’s measurement is less than the 5th percentile, or greater than the 95th percentile, contact your doctor with this information.

, Some children remain shorter than their friends for a couple of years until they experience their pre-pubertal growth spurt.


Many times, older siblings or parents will have had a similar experience. If you experienced a late growth spurt, your child will most likely also have a late growth spurt.

, Keeping track of your child’s growth can help you to monitor any underlying condition that may affect your child’s growth.


In particular, you should continue to check your child if his or her rate of growth slows down and he or she drops down two major percentile sections on the chart (for instance if your child moves from the 75th percentile to the 25th percentile).
This change may a problem with nutrition, underlying chronic illness (such as heart disease or kidney failure), or abnormal hormone production (such as thyroxine and growth hormone). It may also be caused by medications like corticosteroids., There are certain things that you can look out for to know if you should become concerned about your child’s height. These include:


If your child’s height percentiles increase or decrease quickly, especially if two major percentile curves on the chart are crossed.
If your child’s height percentiles are normal, and then begin increasing or decreasing so extremely that they cross the 95th or 5th percentiles.
If your child continues to gain weight but his or her height remains the same.

Accept the infant's individuality.,
Reduce or eliminate the infant's developmental lag.,
Do not be anxious.,
If this is your first-born child, try your best to cope with the ""new-parent blues"".,
Set up positive attitudes and act as the model.,
Take note of the attitudes of other significant people in the child's life.,
Do not deprive your child of independence.,
Let the child socialize and enhance their self-esteem.,
Be a good person.",How to Establish Good Social and Emotional Development in Babies Within the First Two Years," Some adults may interpret being different as being inferior. Avoid setting up norms of behavior based on how you witnessed the growth of earlier-born children and judge a newborn infant in those terms. If the earlier-born children cried very little at night or was easier to nurse and keep down their nourishment, do not be upset or panic if your new infant behaves the opposite. If you express your concerns through your treatment of the infant, this in turn may affect to the infant's adjustments to postnatal life and can have a tendency to increase the severity of the problems.;
, Whether the child was prematurely born, injured at birth, or was a healthy, full-term infant that continued to lose weight or stay stuck at a plateau with no improvement, such lags can be tackled. Regardless of the cause, as a concern to you, it can affect the way you handle the infant's needs. To keep things in perspective, try the following:


Make sure the mother's milk is adequate and if formula is substituted, that it suits the nutritional needs of the infant.
Stimulate the infant by talking to it, picking it up and rocking it. Exercise the arms and legs regularly at different times of the day. There is a growing evidence that having moving objects to look at, singing and talking helps to overcome some of the developmental lag in vision and hearing., Anxious parents will transmit their anxiety by the way they treat the infant.Feeling that the infant is too delicate to be handled any more than is absolutely essential, this reduced handling will result in a failure to stimulate the infant; this intensifies developmental lag and, in turn, can reinforce the unfavorable parental attitude.

, Parental blues often play havoc with the infant's adjustments to postnatal life. The newborn can sense the tension of the parents, especially that of the mother, and it makes the infant nervous and prone to crying.Look at the other parents. Some people started to build families in spite of very complicated situations. Not every person in the world has a good job. No one is perfect. Everyone has their own capabilities and inabilities. Keep in mind that most families overcome hardships to keep their families stable, despite the hardships.
Remember that fears and worries will never help you. Just do what your instinct tells you and believe that you can take care of your child well. Everything is just a matter of mind-setting and confidence.
Focus on your child. Consider that the infant feels whatever you feel. Every parent wants their child to feel happy and free from negative experiences and the best way to do it is to foster happiness and positivity in yourself first.

, Providing a rich social life is the best thing you can do to guarantee a good mind, especially for twelve- to fifteen-month-old children.It is very important that you show children what they should follow, for the following reasons:


Children may fail to follow all the things that the older ones say, but they will never fail to imitate their actions. The best way to teach children how to be a good person is to always show them what a good person looks and acts like. People who interact daily with children should take full responsibility for their actions.
Contrary to tradition, children do not outgrow undesirable traits as they grow older. Instead, patterns established early in life often persist, regardless of whether they are good or bad, harmful or beneficial.If an undesirable pattern of behavior or unfavorable beliefs and attitudes have started to develop, the sooner they can be corrected, the easier it will be for the child.
Since early foundations quickly develop into habits through repetition, good habits will have a lifelong influence on a child's personal and social adjustments.Because learning and experience play dominant roles in development, they can be directed and controlled so that the development will be along lines that will make good personal and social adjustments possible.

, Attitudes of the parents, siblings, grandparents and other relatives are important not so much for their immediate effects but rather because they are likely to persist beyond the period of infancy when their contacts with the children will increase. Those attitudes, in turn will influence the attitude of your child.

, Rapid development of body control enables the child to sit, stand, walk and manipulate objects, and with this decreased dependency, comes a rebellion against being ""babied"". If they are not permitted to try to be independent when they want to be, they protest. These protests may take the form of angry outbursts and crying, which can soon develop into negativism., Egocentrism is a common characteristic of babies, which gives way to a desire to become a part of a social group. They may tend to protest when left alone for any length of time and often try to win someone's attention in any way they can. Failing to respond to this cry for attention may cause them to lose confidence and may later on become shy or a loner., Always follow your values and trust your own instincts and conscience as to how to best treat your child. Everything that you do has its effects on your child. By being good, thinking clearly and doing good things, your child will eventually grow good and be a good person too."

Find the Right Spot.,
Determine the Command Center Essentials.,
Gather Supplies.,
Determine the Design.,
Set up the Center.,
Train Your Family.",How to Organize a Family Command Center," Finding the right spot to set up your family command center is key. The location should be a zone every family member passes through daily. For example, do not place the family command center by the front door no one uses, in a binder on the counter, in the laundry room no one uses except you, or where stinky pets or trash are located. The family command center should be out in plain sight, where it takes more effort to avert your eyes from the center than to just look at it as you pass by.;
, There is such a thing as too much information, so it is imperative that you create your family command center like a federal agent, only disclosing information on a need-to-know basis. For example, do not crowd the family command center with cute greeting cards from grandma or use the spot as a catch all dumping ground. Use this prime location for:


A family calendar
Inboxes and outboxes for each family member (for mail, papers to be signed and returned, and homework)
Weekly chore/task list
Weekly dinner menu
Items-needed shopping list
Non-school-age kid's daily routine or schedule
Daily notes to each other (depending on the age and maturity level of the kids/adults in the house, you may need to edit this board for content)
Home for keys, phones and wallets
Lunchbox and backpack intake

, Once you know what needs to be in the family command center, search your own house first to see if you have any organizational items that can be used to create this space. Look for:


Baskets and crates
File boxes of all sizes
Wall pockets
Clipboards
Wall hooks (command hooks)
Picture frames
Cork board, whiteboard, chalkboard or magnetic board and accompanying accessories including push pins, dry erase marker, chalk, eraser, and magnets
Mirror (for last minute hair and makeup checks before dashing out the door)
Clock
Charging station for electronics (try having the whole family dock their phones at the family command center to increase quality family time and restful sleep)
Organizational furniture including a bench, cubbies, shelving, and a dresser, table or cabinet.

, There are endless possibilities for how to set up a family command center. It is important to set up the space so that it looks clean, uncluttered, and organized. Think about how the family needs to use the space and place the separate components accordingly.


For example, if you are the one who will be updating the family calendar with everyone's activities, place it higher up on the wall where it will be visible to all, but not accidentally erased. If younger children need a place to unpack their lunch boxes, backpacks and papers, place hooks and inboxes lower to the ground for easy access.
For some great crafty tips and pics on how to set up your own family command center check out Pinterest, Remodelaholic, Domestically Speaking, Getsnazzy, or even just search google images Google for ""Family Command Center.""

, Make sure to secure all hooks, folders, baskets and shelving to the wall using the correct equipment so that it stands up to the abuse your family will inflict throughout the year.

, Once your family command center is installed, looking beautiful and functional, train your family on the new organizational system. Your new system will not stand a chance unless the whole family is on board.


The first week or two, you will have to act as ""the enforcer"" and gently remind your family on how to use the system. Keep calm and carry on reminding them, and pretty soon the family command center will become an integral part of how your family functions. It will almost magically bring family members closer together, increase communication, and keep stress at an all-time low by establishing reassuring family routines.

Think about everyone's perspective.,
Reflect on how the conflict affects other family members.,
Ask other family members about how they're feeling.,
Look for the underlying issue.,
Establish ground rules for the discussion.,
Encourage everyone to control their emotions.,
Paraphrase people's thoughts.,
Make sure everyone has a chance to express themselves.,
Work on healing the relationships.,
Strive for forgiveness.,
Keep your expectations realistic.",How to Mediate Family Arguments," Before attempting to mediate disagreements, make sure you look at all sides of the argument. While you shouldn't take sides when attempting to mediate, you don't want anyone to think you're overlooking their point of view. Take some time to think about why everyone feels wronged or hurt in the situation.You will have to resist the urge to judge here. It can be difficult to look at family situations objectively, especially if you're emotionally involved in the conflict. Try to think about how you would react hearing about the conflict as an outsider.
Examine why both parties feel wronged and hurt. Consider your family's history and what role, if any, this plays in the drama. Also, look within yourself. Have you done or said anything that could have escalated the situation? How do you think other family member's felt about some of your actions? Try acknowledging this out loud, such as by saying, “I shouldn’t have raised my voice. I am sure it was upsetting for you to hear that.” Acknowledging this out loud and leading by example can set the tone for other people to follow suit! You want to behave admirably and have people want to replicate that.;
, Mediating drama can be difficult. However, it's important to have the strength and resolve to work towards a solution despite the stress of it. One way to keep yourself strong is to remind yourself who is getting hurt. Oftentimes, a conflict between two family members affects everyone in the family.Think about who's caught in the middle. For example, if your two uncles are fighting, maybe their kids are in the middle. While all the cousins like to get together once in a while, it's become awkward due to the rift between their fathers.
The fact other family members are affected is something you can use to encourage resolution. If the two opposing sides do not want to meet, remind them of how their drama adversely affects those around them. This may be the push they need to mend fences.

, As a mediator, you want to have as nuanced an understanding of the situation as possible. The best way to understand someone's point of view is to ask. Before getting everyone together for a talk, ask a variety of family members how they feel about the situation.You don't want to engage in bad mouthing. However, try to encourage everyone to explain why they're feeling the way they do. Use active listening techniques to emphasize to them that they've been heard and understood.
For example, ""Uncle Dave, you seem really tense about seeing Uncle Clark for Thanksgiving. Is there something going on there?""

, With families especially, an argument is rarely about the surface level issue. If a family member reacts very negatively to a seemingly trivial thing, chances are there's some kind of old feud or resentment at play. Reflecting on your family's history can help you trace the roots of feuds and address the situation more effectively.For example, if your uncles are fighting because one of them made a passing joke about the other's job, chances are there is more going on. Maybe one uncle always out-shined the other growing up. Maybe they have always been very competitive with one another.
In this case, the issue isn't just about personal tact when it comes to humor. The issue is about insecurity. Knowing this will make it easier to address everyone's feelings when mediating the issue.

, When you get your family together to talk, you need to establish some rules. Be sure to encourage the various parties to help in this process of creating rules. That way you won't seem like you're lecturing or being condescending. This will also help to assure the conversation runs smoothly and everyone can express themselves.A good general ground rule is that only one person can talk at a time. You can discourage others from interrupting. You can start off by saying something like, ""Even if you disagree with what someone is saying, it's important to let that person talk for the sake of this mediation. You can respond when they're done.""
You can also have general rules about managing emotion. Let everyone know that, no matter how angry they get, no one should raise their voice or use foul language.

, It's not uncommon for tensions to run high when discussing family conflict. There may be times when people get emotional and angry. Try to rein in the emotional outbursts as much as you can. While everyone has a right to their personal feelings, make it clear these feelings must be expressed in an appropriate, productive fashion.Let someone know if they're getting out of control. Say something like, ""Uncle Clark, you're starting to raise your voice"" or ""Uncle Dave, you shouldn't use words like that. It's not productive.""
Remember not to try to shout over them when they raise their voice. Keep your tone gentle and your voice soft. Use brief prompts such as ""lets keep it down"" to keep them on track when they start to stray. You can also ask if they'd like to take a moment to breathe or compose themselves.

, It's important that everyone feels truly heard during a mediation. After someone speaks, briefly paraphrase their words. Give them a chance to clarify if you're misinterpreting something. This way, everyone will feel heard during a mediation.For example, ""Uncle Dave, I'm hearing you feel like Clark was being condescending about your job. You worked really hard for the promotion, and while you don't mind joking around, you felt like Clark should have congratulated you first.""

, Do not end the conversation until everyone has expressed themselves. Go around the room and give everyone the chance to talk. Then, go around the room again and let everyone respond. Before ending the conversation, say something like, ""Does that cover it? Does anyone else have something they would like to share?"" You never want to end a negotiation before all parties have vented their feelings and frustrations about a situation., The solution you reach during a mediation is rarely cut and dry. You may not have an exact, specific game plan. However, everyone should leave with some idea of how to heal broken relationships.It's not your job to offer exact courses of action. However, you can offer suggestions how family members could better treat one another in the future. Think about what has been said during mediation. Look for areas where change is needed.
Remember to seek the input of others. Ask them specifically what they are willing to do to help improve the situation. Start with your own areas of change if appropriate.
Suggest something that needs to be different in the future. For example, ""As a person's career is so vital to their sense of self, maybe we should all use more sensitivity when joking about someone's job.""
You should also agree to work actively on letting go of the feud. For example, ""For the next couple of months, let's agree not to bring this up. We don't have to talk about it over Thanksgiving. I think this will give everyone a chance to let some of this go and move forward.""

, You can start by forgiving the family members in question yourself. Even if you were not directly involved in the feud, you were probably affected by the drama in some way. Choose forgiveness. Remember, you can't control someone else's actions but you can control your own response.You can also encourage other family members to forgive. However, remember you cannot force someone to feel a particular way.

, If a family argument or conflict has been going on for awhile, you're not going to fix it overnight. Moving forward, expect that things will continue to be strained. If the family members in question are difficult and melodramatic by nature, they may be unwilling to completely mend fences. At the next holiday or get together, accept there may still be tension despite your best efforts.Keep in mind that it might take several conversations before a situation is better. Give everyone involved a break, but don't be afraid to revisit the issue down the line to see where areas of progress exist. Express pleasure about this and encourage everyone to keep trying.

Understand you have the same rights as teens who do not have CPS involved.,
If you live in Mississippi Alabama, or Nebraska you can move out at 18 - yes, you heard correctly, you can move out at 18 and I repeat, you can move out at 18.,
Establish legal residence where you don't actually live.,
Monitor CPS visits.,
Know they can access your records under FERPA.,
Tell everyone (i.e.,
If they come to your school (or anyone) to interview, decline.

",How to Move out at 18 when CPS Is Involved," You have the right to move out at your 18th birthday, drop out of school (don't do that), to not attend school (don't do that), to enter into contracts, vote, to have control over the disclosure of the records (except specified in FERPA) http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html and any other rights granted in your state.;
, You have the same rights as those in other states except you can't get married in Mississippi until 21 and in Nebraska 19. In Alabama, although the age of majority is 19, you can get married at 18. in ALL 50 STATES, you can move out at 18.

, Stay at a hotel but your mail goes to your friend's house. That way CPS will be less likely to contact you.

, Park a car next to your parent's home and put a camera in the car. A nanny cam is a hidden camera that is installed within an object such as camera in a tissue box. http://www.knowyournanny.com/ has good cameras. Use the CPS tracking sheet or create your own. http://www.slideshare.net/Lawlaloopsy/cps-tracking-record It should contain the row number, the date of the visit, the place of the visit, (if they might visit a friend, your school, your mental health agency or anywhere pertaining to you) the time they came and the time they left, and a comments column where you can write observations you made about CPS such as them bringing a school staff member along to your parent's home or CPS holding your inappropriate drawing. Write the comments small so you have room to write more comments but big enough for you to read. Attach extra pages or post-its if necessary and put the date or the row number so you know what visit that belongs to.

, This is one exception to FERPA. If you have or had truancy problems and CPS calls your school to make sure you are there, they will likely call your school and make sure you are in school at 18. However, they cannot do anything if you're not in school. For example, if you go to juvenile detention or court for not going to school, that won't happen anymore once you turn 18. CPS also might ask about your behavior and/or progress in school. Because you are not living with your parents, your parents will not know about your behavior and therefore cannot talk to CPS about it. Therefore, CPS might ask your school or your friend's parents if you were staying with your them about your behavior/progress or whether you are going to school or not.

, friends, people you are staying with, your doctor) not to answer CPS's questions. Describe what the CPS workers look like so they will be less likely to answer their question. Professionals (i.e. your doctor, school or mental health agency) will be more likely to answer CPS questions.

Plan your wedding proposal to her involving your friends.,
Obtain the necessary materials.,
Keep yourself out of the hunt.,
Start with the end in mind.,
Assign your friends to groups.,
Give each group a list of the things they should accomplish for the scavenger hunt.,
Tell the other groups to forfeit the game somewhere around item 6 or 7 on their list, but tell them to change into their formal attire.,
When she’s finally at the venue, walk to her slowly before telling her what you really feel and how much she means to you.",How to Propose to Her Using a Scavenger Hunt Game," Make sure that the way that they know about this is discreet, so that the only person who doesn’t know is your beloved. This will ensure that you can can flawlessly execute your plan.;
, For the scavenger hunt, everybody is required to bring a digital camera, mode of transportation and a formal dress, the last of which is required to pull off the proposal at the end of the hunt.

, In order for this to work, you will not be part of the team performing tasks from the list. Instead, you will be included as part of the final task that should lead your wife-to-be to your location. Once you arrive, you can catch her off-guard and ask for her hand in marriage.

, Think of the best place where your final task will take place. Places to consider include the beach, a hotel room (it’s going to cost you a bit though, but what the heck, right?), a restaurant where you guys often eat together or right in front of a cathedral. Just make sure that the place you choose is somewhere meaningful to both of you or her.

, The idea here is that everybody involved in the scavenger hunt, with the exception of the woman you love, knows that you will propose. A team composed of at least three of your friends and assigning each team tasks will help you carry out your plan. Appoint some of your friends to accompany your soon-to-be-fiancé and ask them to regularly inform you of their whereabouts while the scavenger hunt is ongoing. It doesn’t matter how many teams you have assigned, but the more participants, the merrier the hunt should be, right?

, Extend your hunting grounds by making them go to unfamiliar territory. This should buy you more time to decorate the place, set up a table of champagne and strawberries, change into your best clothes or other things you need to do before she gets to her final task. Tell each group they can’t move on to the next task without finishing the task before it; of course, the only group who’ll be doing this strictly is the group she belongs to. Instruct them to take pictures or videos of them doing the task so they have proof. Here is an example of a scavenger hunt list:


Go to the park and make a stranger tell you you’re beautiful or handsome without telling them you’re playing a game. At least two persons from the group should do this (2/3) to proceed to the next task.
From the park, buy two hot dogs and then proceed to the nearest mall with three floors. On the ground level of the mall, find a couple and have them eat the hot dogs. Wait for them to finish eating the hot dogs before proceeding to the second floor of the mall.
On the second level of the mall, find a clothing store and have a male member of the group try on a woman’s clothing or a female member try on men’s clothing – it should be whole attire. Ask a saleslady if it looks good on you, if she says “no,” the group may proceed to the next task. If she says yes, change into something else then ask a different saleslady until you get a “no” for an answer.
Go to the third level of the mall, look for a girl or a boy wearing pink and have two members in their team take a picture with him or her. Don’t forget to get the photos printed.
Go down to the second level of the mall and look for the saleslady whom you got to say “no” and ask her to sign the photos.
Go down the ground level and find someone who would be willing to accept the photos and keep them.
Outside the mall, all three members of the group should ask a stranger for a quarter. Keep the quarters afterwards as you will need them.
At the nearest museum, each of the members needs to ask three strangers for their names and mobile phone numbers.
Outside the museum, look for the nearest payphone and use the quarters to call the numbers you gathered. Ask the person on the other end if he/she’s the guy/girl you met in the museum, do 10 push ups in front of the payphone for every fake number you called.
Go to the nearest public toilet and change into formal attire. Have your photo taken in front of the public toilet’s entrance, then proceed to the next area.

, Make everything appear realistic as if they are really playing the game. However, everybody except the group with your soon-to-be-wife should be at the venue before she gets there. While she’s playing the game, you can ask your friends to help you set up everything you need.

, Tell her that compliments like being handsome, smart or funny mean nothing to you if it did not come from her; that hot dogs taste so much better than gourmet meals if you’re eating them together; and that you’d be willing to look like a complete idiot in a woman’s clothing if she asks you to. Most importantly, tell her how much you love her, pull out the ring in your pocket then pop the question “May I have the honor of spending the rest of my life with you?”

For example, start doing more chores around the house, help people out, answer everybody's questions, show your talent (e.g. singing, piano, etc.). People will more than likely start to talk about you and how you have changed. This will make your cousin get jealous.

, Do well in school, make more friends, be outgoing, act smart, positive, bright, and act confident. But most importantly, do your best.

, When your cousin shows off, brags, tries to impress you or other people, or tries to be cool in front of everyone, say, ""Oh, I got an A+ on my math test on Friday! I had 100%!"". Be sure to get good grades in school. Try getting all A's because most of the people that are popular in school have good grades. Not only that, but everyone should have good grades regardless, not just to get / be popular!

, If your cousin pretends to be so cool -- say, ""Hey,I just got a new boyfriend / girlfriend a few days / weeks ago!"" or ""I made so many new friends from school and they never stop calling and texting me""!

, They will have some sort of reaction, and they may seem immature when they face you and have seen you have matured, but they haven't. And when people see you have changed in life they will think better of you, while your cousin hasn't changed and acted more mature in life since they've been ""showing off"" or acting ""cool"" or ""bragging about themselves"" instead of being his/her real actual self this whole time!

, Always look on the bright side whether if it is a problem, or someone hurt, or someone sad and your cousin will notice you are mature because you are always happy and want to think about good things, not bad things.

, Take Charge. If he / she tells you to do something and you don't want to do it, don't do it. Show her that he / she cannot boss you around.

, You will show her how much you have matured, and while he / she is still complaining, the adult will see that you are way more mature than him / her.

, If your cousin teases you, makes fun of you, mocks you, or embarrasses you, or even makes a low comment about you, just ignore it, and act as if you did not even hear what he / she said. Also, act like you do not care about what they said negative about you.

Don't make large purchases without discussing them first.,

Use software to monitor your finances.",How to Manage Family Finances," While this is important all the way through life, it is especially important to establish financial honestly before you get married. If one partner has a poor credit history or large debts that are not brought up before marriage, it can lead to resentment and problems down the road. Before getting married, you should meet with your loved one and discuss his current financial situation, including how much he makes, where that money goes, his credit history, and any large debts he is carrying. This sets the tone for financial openness in the rest of your lives together., Decide on a time of the month to get together specifically to discuss your finances. Perhaps this meeting can coincide with the arrival of the monthly bank statement or the due date of monthly bills. In any case, use your time at this meeting to assess the previous month's expenditures, mark your progress towards long-term goals, and to propose any changes or major purchases that you want to make. Only by talking about money regularly can you make doing so a comfortable and productive experience., Many families choose to allow one person to take charge of all the family's finances; however, this places an unnecessary burden on that person and leads to others' being unaware of the family's current financial situation. In addition, if that person leaves through death or divorce, it leaves the others completely unaware of how to manage or even access the family's finances. Solve this problem by splitting up tasks between you or by managing finances in alternating months.


Both you and your spouse should attend any meetings with financial professionals, such as those with a loan officer or investment advisor., Families have options when it comes to setting up joint accounts. Some choose to keep everything together while others keep their finances mostly separate. At minimum, you should have a joint account to pay for household expenses and your mortgage payment. At the end of the month, you can split these expenses in half and each transfer in an equal amount of money into this account to pay these expenses. Having separate account can prevent arguments that might arise from one person's spending habits.


Just make sure to set limits to how much money each of you can spend each month so that one person doesn't end up spending all of the family's money., Even though your finances will be combined, it is still important for each of you to have a strong credit score. Doing so will ensure not only that your credit will be good when you apply for credit jointly, but also that your credit history will remain intact if you split up. A simple way to manage this is by having separate credit cards, each established only in the name of the spouse who uses it., Before you create a budget, you'll have to decide how to keep that budget. While many people can get away with just using a notepad and pen, others find it easier to track their spending through a spreadsheet or financial software. There are a number of a free software platforms available online that you can use to establish and track a budget. For example, programs like Mint.com and Manilla offer free budgeting services. If you want full service financial software, try Quicken or Microsoft Money., For a month, write down a note every time you spend money, even for very small amounts. Record the amount spent and what it was you paid for. At the end of the month, sit down with your spouse and total up both your spending. Add in major expenditures to get a clear picture of where the family's money went that month. Split up expenses by category (home, car, food, etc.) if you can. Then, compare that amount to your combined, after-tax income. This is your starting point for determining a budget.


It may also be helpful to work with your bank statement to make sure you didn't miss any recurring payments or online purchases when totaling your expenses., Look at your compiled spending habits. Do you have a surplus? Or are you spending more than you make? Work from here to identify areas where you can cut back, if needed. If at all possible, try to free up money that can be put into savings or into the retirement fund. Create spending limits on certain categories, like food and entertainment, and try to stick to them over time.


Remember to always leave room in your monthly budget for unexpected expenses, like small medical bills or car repairs., Return to your budget regularly to eliminate unnecessary spending or to adjust your budgeted amounts as needed. For example, having a child may cause you to have to completely restructure your budget. In any case, constantly seek out areas where you can cut back and save more. You'll find that you can be just as happy while spending much less than you do now., Have an open conversation about your savings goals, including saving for a house, for retirement, and for other large purchases like a car or boat. Make sure that you both agree that the purchase or expense in question is worth saving for and that you agree on the amount needed. This will help coordinate your savings and investment efforts., Every family should strive to keep an emergency savings fund for when things go south. Who knows when one of you might lose a job or experience unexpected medical problems? An emergency fund can help you avoid future debt and provide some financial security and flexibility.The traditional wisdom is to keep three to six month's salary in a savings account; however, this would be more than enough for some families and not nearly enough for others. Luckily, there are several financial calculators online that you can use to calculate roughly how much you need to save to cover your expenses.


Try searching for emergency fund calculators using a search engine.
There is also an app, HelloWallet, that offers this type of calculator., Your first goal should be to pay off your existing debt. Only by paying down student loans, car loans, and other debt can you qualify for more credit as a couple and move forward with saving for other goals. To eliminate debt, work together to pay more than the minimum payment on each loan (as long as there are no prepayment penalties for doing so). Work with your spouse to create a plan and schedule for paying off your outstanding debt. If necessary, have one of you in charge of making sure that debt payments have been made each month., Couples should start planning for retirement as early as possible. This is because, due to the effects of compound interest, money placed in a retirement fund at a young age will earn much more interest over its life than the same amount of money put in at a later age. Make sure to make every effort to increase your retirement savings, including seeking to max out your employer's 401(k) match (if they have one), maxing out IRS-limits for 401(k) savings, and regularly increasing your retirement savings amounts if you can fit it into the budget.


You should save for retirement before putting money into education funds for your children. This is because there will always be scholarships and grants available for education, but not for your retirement.
If you don't have a combined retirement portfolio, be sure to coordinate your risk profiles and asset allocations., If you're planning to fund part or all your child's higher education, it's best to start saving early on. Start by investigating options like 529 savings plans, which have special tax benefits for students. Speak with a financial advisor to learn more and get started saving today. If you don't have much time before your child leaves for school, look into government loans and grants, as well as your option in earning federal student aid., Establish a monetary limit for what constitutes a ""major"" purchase. Obviously, this will differ between families, but the important thing is that you have a set limit. For any purchases above this limit, decide that the spouse making the purchase must have the approval of the other before going through with it. If either of you ever breaks this rule, be sure to tell the other immediately. Keeping large expenditures private is just asking for trouble., Keep each other on track by avoiding taking on debt for medium-sized purchases like furniture or jewelry. Plan these purchases out beforehand with your spouse so that you can combine your resources and afford the full amount of the purchase. This will save you money on interest payments in the long term. In addition, always check in with each other about credit card debt. It may be in your best interest to help a spouse with her credit card payment if she can't make it; missing a monthly payment will hurt your combined credit, which you will need if you apply for a large loan like a mortgage., With all of the budgeting and financial planning software available today, you'd be a fool not to take advantage of these useful tools. For starters, try tracking your monthly budget in a shared spreadsheet like those available in Google Drive. This type of document allows both of you to access and change the sheet as needed. For budgeting, there is are apps available like HomeBudget or Mint, which summarize the family budget and assets into a simple user interface.


There are also apps for keeping track of financial paperwork, like FileThis.
Try a few of these apps out and decide which ones work for you. Most of them are free or inexpensive to use, or at least offer a trial period."

, Doing this will make them do it even more and not feel sorry for you because they will think it annoys you and makes you mad, but not enough to make you dislike them and not/never talk to them anymore.

, If they are one of those cousins who you always talk to a lot, start making your conversations shorter and shorter each time you see them, and make sure people notice so when you don't talk at all, people won't notice or think anything of it and they won't know that you are trying to make this person guilty. Having people notice you talking to someone less and less is better than having them notice seeing you ignore your cousin, right?

, If they stare at you, do not take any notice of them. If they try talking to you, act like you didn't hear them, keep saying ""What? What? What? What did you say""? each time they repeat what they say to you, or you can simply act as if you forgot about them,or you can act as if you don't even know who they are when they talk to you.

, Never talk to them, look at them, text and/or call them. If anyone takes notice of this just say you forgot about them, and if the person that noticed acts mad, just act like you don't care at all or you can act confused, or you can act both ways and they will probably simply get over it seeing you not caring and acting as if it's nothing and not a big deal at all.

Consider the patient.,
Put your own needs aside.,
Talk to the physician, hopefully more than one.,
Make a decision based on what you believe your loved one's wishes would be.,
Never regret your decision, it was the best decision you could make at the time.

,
Learn about DNR, DNI and comfort care directives.,
Know that these decisions are yours to make - nurses and doctors can not make them for you.,
Don't wait until the last minute to discuss this.",How to Make Life and Death Decisions for a Family Member/Loved One," The most important person to consider is the patient/loved one for whom the decision needs to be made. What are their wishes, what would they want? What have they said in the past about life support, death and dying?;
, The hardest thing is putting your own wants, and the need to hold on to that person, aside, and deciding in the best interest of the patient/loved one. No one wants to lose a loved one, but is holding on to a person in a vegetative state, or putting someone through pain and suffering to keep them alive, what they would want?

, Ask questions about quality of life, potential outcomes, and alternatives. Don't expect your physician or the nurse to say how long a person has to live, since no one knows that but a higher power.

, There is no right or wrong choice. Some people are kept alive until their body won't function any more. Some people are taken off life support and life-sustaining treatments like ventilators, dialysis, and tube feeding and allowed to go peacefully in their own time.

,,


DNR (do not resuscitate) means nothing will be done to bring this person back if their heart stops or they quit breathing. They will be allowed to die without any measures to keep them alive. They will not have a tube put down to help them breath, they will not have someone compressing their chest to make their blood flow, and they will not be given medications to sustain life. They will still be kept comfortable, and any pain medications and treatments they are already receiving to keep them comfortable can be continued.
DNI (do not intubate) means everything will be done to keep them alive except placing a tube down into their lungs and being placed on a ventilator to breathe. Chest compressions will still be done, and medicine will still be given.
Consider comfort care only. You can specify that you only want measures taken to keep your loved one comfortable. No lab work, finger sticks, x-rays, or other procedures will be done. Only pain medicine and medicine to assist with comfort will be given.
If you have a loved one in a nursing home or assisted living and they have a DNR or DNI status, obtain an armband, necklace, bracelet, or some kind of identification that states this. Many times when a resident collapses or goes into distress, the staff will not immediately remember the code status of the patient. If the patient has this identification on them and emergency personnel are called to the scene, it may prevent a person from having life sustaining measures done to them when they do not wish them done.

, Discuss these issues with other family members and try to come to an agreement on what you want, keeping the loved one's wishes in mind. Feel free to ask doctors and nurses any questions you may have.

, If you have a loved one with cancer or a disease that may be life ending, find a time when you can discuss what their wishes are. Even if your loved one is perfectly healthy, having this discussion is important. No one likes to talk about death and dying, and surely not their own death, but it makes it so much better for the families when they know they are doing what their loved one wanted.

Prioritize your time.,
Organize your things.,
Take advantage of all your resources.,
Adopt family-time goals.,
Unplug when you’re at home.,
Don’t compare yourself to others.",How to Maximize Family Time1," Organize your obligations into “Do,” “Don’t Do,” and “Delegate.” Instead of trying to do it all, figure out which household tasks need to be done (your “Do” list), and which can wait (your “Don’t Do” list). If there are things you could get your partner, your kids, or a hired hand to do – washing the dishes, walking the dog, and so on – separate them into your “Delegate” list.This will rebalance your family’s time in such a way that you all have the ability to spend more time together, instead of you and/or your partner taking on a disproportionate amount of housework.
Be realistic and honest when evaluating your time. Don’t add something to your “Do” list just because you feel guilty.
Organize your work tasks, too, so that you can identify which things need doing and which you can delegate to a coworker.;
, You can lose a lot of time that can be spent with your family (or on yourself) by searching for misplaced keys, remote controls, and other essential belongings. Choose a convenient location for your wallet or purse, your keys, and your glasses. Get in the habit of placing these essentials – especially the things you seem to lose frequently – in the same place every day.For instance, you might choose to always put your glasses by the bedside, and your keys by the door.

, Look for ways to save time and use them whenever possible. For instance, if your dry cleaner offers free pickup, or you can get your pizza delivered instead of picking it up, spring for these convenience services. This will help you maximize your family time.If you’re enrolled in university, use the campus gym instead of trekking from school to the gym and then home., If you’re the type of person who rises to a challenge, you might benefit from trying to make and meet unique family-related goals. Set a minimum amount of time to spend with your family each week – for instance, 15 hours. Or you could try a qualitative goal like making your child smile at dinner.Change your family-time goals regularly to keep the contest fresh.

, Instead of checking email, working on projects, and texting friends or coworkers when you’re home, turn your phone off and shut down your computer. This way, your family will get your undivided attention. After your kids and partner are asleep, you can log back on.This is especially important during family outings and meals.
You can also use your computer and phone early in the morning, when your kids and partner are asleep., Some people get discouraged because they think, “I could never maximize my family time in the way that my neighbor did.” This is defeatist thinking and will not help you maximize your family time. Instead, organize your time as well a possible without passing judgment on yourself.Remember, nobody can spend all their time with their family.

"
"
Get your family on board.,
Schedule family time.,
Limit the amount of screen time for your kids.,
Make new traditions.",How to Maximize Family Time2," Maximizing family time only works if everyone is trying to increase the amount of time you spend together. Encourage your kids to limit their extracurriculars to one or two activities per semester. Ask your partner to improve their time-management and adopt the same measures that you do in order to maximize family time.Say to your kids, “Please keep your afterschool activities to one or two per school semester so that we have more family time.”
Say to your partner, “I’m reducing my screen time, organizing my things, and finding other ways to maximize my family time. I’d like to help you do the same. Let’s do it together.”

, Calendars or personal planners are great for organizing time in a structured way. Many people assume that because spending time with the family is not a formal obligation, it doesn’t need a spot on the calendar. However, if you don’t assign a specific time for hanging out with your family, you might let it slip through the cracks. To maximize your family time, set aside a few hours each day for them.Schedule specific family events as well as general “family time” when filling out your planner or calendar. Schedule date nights at specific venues and restaurants, and plan on going to specific baseball games or fairs with your kids.Use automatic reminders in your phone or email to stay on top of your scheduled family time.
Use vacation time to extend your holidays with your family., If you allow them to, kids will stay glued to their TV or computer. Set rules that limit the amount of recreational use your child makes of the TV and computer. One hour of TV and an hour of web surfing each day should be enough.Explain to your kids that limiting TV and computer screen time not only provides more time for moving and playing outside, but also helps maximize the amount of time that you spend together as a family.
Simply say to your kids, “Please spend no more than one hour each day on your phone, computer, or in front of the television. That way, you’ll have more time to spend with your family.”

, Everyone gets together on holidays, but you should aim to spend at least one night each week with your family. For instance, set aside Friday nights for pizza and card games with your kids. Ensure everyone in the family is participating by forbidding phones and tablets during the designated family time. Other traditions your family might enjoy include:Dining out at a new restaurant together
Seeing a new movie together
Going for a family bike ride
Having a Sunday brunch together

Look into ways to streamline your daily commute.,
Look for ways to streamline your time at work.,
Shop online.,
Make meals ahead of time.,
Get it to go.",How to Maximize Family Time3," Riding public transit is great because it gives you time to answer emails, read work-related materials, or work on your laptop during your commute. This means that you’ll have more time to spend with your family when you’re at home.You could also check for alternate routes and short cuts. Lay a map out on your table of your municipality. Trace your route to work on the map. Look for alternate routes and give them a try. If they save you time, use them instead of the route you’ve been taking.

, There are several ways to streamline your time at work so as to maximize family time. You could change when you work, how you work, or where you work.Working from home will increase the amount of time you’re able to spend with your family. Use your breaks to spend time with your family.
Work from home. Many productive and enjoyable occupations can be done at home. If you are a writer, graphic designer, or artist, you might be able to convince your employer to let you work from home – or go into business for yourself.
Before asking your boss if you can work from home, talk to someone in your Human Resources department to determine if such a request could be accommodated.
Cut back on work-related travel. Ask your boss if you could conduct conferences that you’d normally have to travel to via an online webcam program like Skype. Volunteer for shorter trips that don’t keep you away from home for so long instead of the longer trips that take you further from your family.
Encourage your boss to assign some of the work-related travel to other employees.
Take care of emails and projects early in the morning before your family rises, or late at night after they are asleep.

, Shopping can take a lot of time. In order to cut back on time wasted on shopping, buy things online. There’s no traveling to and from the store, no standing in line, and no wasting time browsing the shelves to find what you’re looking for. Online shopping is fast and convenient, and can help you maximize family time.


To shop online, just buy through the website of your favorite retailer. For instance, if you enjoy shopping at E-Mart, just visit the store’s website, pay for the items you want, and wait for the delivery.
In some cases, the extra costs associated with shipping might make online shopping impractical. Compare prices carefully before deciding to shop online.

, Making twice as much food usually doesn’t take twice as long. Instead of making dinner every night, double up on certain recipes that you can eat as leftovers the next night, or even the one after next. For instance, if you make a big pan of lasagna or a big pot of stew, you should be set for the next few nights.You can refrigerate any meal for at least two or three days.
If you make a really big batch of chicken, turkey, or most veggies, you can easily freeze them for even longer.

, Carryout meals are not generally recommended because they tend to have higher calorie counts and are less healthy than home-cooked meals. However, if you’re located near a quality diner and can get some salads, wraps, and other meals to go when you’re busy, do it. Just don’t make take-out a habit.Avoid getting fast food, even when you’re busy. Fast food is loaded with salt, sugar, and fat, and does not contribute to overall good health.

Encourage spontaneity.,
Find out what your family likes to do.,
Offer suggestions to your family.,
Try outdoor activities.,
Enjoy lazy mornings together.",How to Maximize Family Time4," Don’t be afraid to try something different during your family time. In addition to encouraging suggestions from your kids and partner, you should be flexible and willing to do something totally different if your family wants to switch things up a bit. The more fun everyone has, the more likely they will be to make family time a centerpiece in their own lives., You probably already have an idea of what your family enjoys. But hobbies and tastes change over time, and your kids or partner might have a new hobby that you could all enjoy as a family. Maybe there are even some things your kids or partner would like to do but haven’t had the opportunity to try yet.You could ask your family, “What would you like to do during our scheduled family time?”

, Your family is interested in what you have to say. You should feel that you can offer suggestions for family time activities, too. But don’t foist your choices on others. Ensure that you and your family have a pleasant conversation about possible options, and arrive at a consensus afterwards. You might suggest:Going to the park (For instance, you could ask your family, “How about going to the park?”)
Taking a walk (For instance, you could ask your family, “Would you like to take a walk?”)
Playing a game (For instance, you could ask your family, “Does anyone want to play a game?”)
Canoeing (For instance, you could ask your family, “How about taking the canoe up the river?”)
Hiking (For instance, you could ask your family, “How about hiking in the woods?”)
Visiting a local museum (For instance, you could say, “There’s a new exhibit at the museum. Let’s see it together.”)

, Don’t get stuck inside. Spending family time inside watching movies and playing games has its place. But, weather permitting, you should head outside and enjoy a walk, bike ride, or other outdoor activity with your family. For instance, you and your family might enjoy:Swimming at the lake
Mountain climbing
Parasailing
Hang-gliding
Spelunking

, Stay in bed for a bit longer instead of waking up in the morning as soon as possible. You might also enjoy a sit-down pancake breakfast with your family. Take a meandering stroll together after brunch. Those extra few minutes you spend with your family will add up in the long term, giving you and your family a stronger bond."

",How to Honor Fallen Soldiers on Memorial Day with a Video," While many families across the country will be planning back yard barbecues and outdoor social gatherings to enjoy a three-day weekend, it is important to remember the true meaning of Memorial Day, which is to honor and remember soldiers who served this country.

Recognize the day’s emphasis on independence.,
Acknowledge the utility of the canes’ color.,
Celebrate how independence continues to be achieved today.",How to Celebrate National White Cane Safety Day1," Much of the significance that white canes have earned is tied to their user’s ability to move on their own and desire to be treated as self-reliant. In fact, White Cane Day was first established to celebrate and recognize the success that blind people have had in traveling autonomously and in organizing for legal rights through the National Federation of the Blind.Accordingly, the white cane itself is considered a symbol of a blind person’s ability to move on their own.;
, While it’s important to recognize the cane’s symbolic significance to many users’ identities, the cane also serves a more literal purpose. A white cane in particular legally identifies someone as blind or visually impaired. This is most important as an indicator to motorists that a pedestrian may not be able to see them.The white cane also informs others of someone’s visual impairment, which can inform conversation between a blind person and other people.
Note that white canes are sometimes tipped or striped with red, yellow, or blue. The only important aspect of these cane's color is that they are mostly white - as this indicates to others that the user is blind or visually impaired.

, Since White Cane Day was established, blind and visually impaired people have continued to increase their mobility and independence. Blind people are not only increasingly traveling on their own, they also work in all sorts of professional positions. In the words of a prominent blind person’s advocacy group, “The blind are able to go, to move, to be, and to compete with all others in society.”The white cane continues to be instrumental in blind people’s ability to move on their own, but it is also increasingly used a symbol of blind people’s determination and success in continuing to be independent.
Indeed, even as new technologies emerge to assist those with visual impairments - including new types of white canes - the cane itself will likely persist as a symbol of increasing independence.

"
"
Read your state’s white cane laws.,
Compare your area’s law to the Model White Cane Bill.,
Become a mobility and orientation specialist.",How to Celebrate National White Cane Safety Day2," The model White Cane Law has been codified into law in some form in every U.S. state. However, not every state requires drivers to stop or yield for pedestrians carrying a white cane, which was the initial goal of the law, and reflects the most tangible utility of carrying a white cane. For instance, some states do not grant any special protection to pedestrians carrying white canes. .


Check the American Council of the Blind’s website to read the language that describes driver and pedestrian rights and responsibilities in your area., If your state is lacking in lacking in significant measures to ensure the safety and equality of the blind and visually impaired, you may wish to lend support for the appropriate legislative changes.For instance, you could write a letter to your legislator outlining the parameters of the Model White Cane Bill, and your desire to see the law in your area better reflect that model.
The National Federation of the Blind has drafted a White Cane Safety Day Proclamation you could use as a guide to guide your letter or conversation with your representative. Your legislator may even wish to use this guide for their own proclamation. , Aside from legal and political advocacy, consider getting trained to help people learn to use a white cane. More specifically, you can be trained to help people learn to travel on their own and keep their orientation within different environments. In order to do so, of course, you must experience what it’s like to walk without vision.Training to become an M&O specialist requires 120 hours of walking while blindfolded. The two-year certification process ensures that you are familiar with the experience of walking without relying on sight.
To begin the training process, contact a school for the blind in your state. They will be able to provide you with a list of institutions that offer the training.

"

Contact a local organization.,
Go to a White Cane Day celebration.,
Participate in a white cane walk.",How to Celebrate National White Cane Safety Day3," Your city or state may have an organization that focuses on advocacy or services for the blind. If they are not hosting a celebration for the upcoming White Cane Day, they can likely let you know of any celebrations in your area.


If you are interested in helping organizing an event, it's important to have the guidance of those who have established themselves as allies and advocates of blind people's rights and culture.
If you are unable to find a local organization in your area, search online for a nearby school for the blind. They will be the best source of knowledge about local organizations that may be organizing or hosting an event for White Cane Day.

, Many communities host annual celebrations of White Cane Day. These often include remarks by legislators, local advocates, and other community members. Further, there are often planned activities for everyone, regardless of one’s ability to see.These celebrations may include some unexpected activities. For instance, last year's celebration in one U.S. city included a climbing wall.
Government websites are the best places to find out about planned events. You can also call your town hall directly and ask what official events are planned in your area.

, Many White Cane Day celebrations include walks or marches. Often, canes and blindfolds will be provided to those who can see, but who want to participate alongside blind people and experience what it is like to be a blind pedestrian. Specific routes will be planned in advance, and may even stop at politically or culturally relevant locations.Note that not all communities will have White Can Day celebrations. The larger cities in your area, especially the state capital, are more likely locations for white cane walks and marches.

You could also just do something nice for her. Make her breakfast or do her chores to show how much you care.

, National Sister’s Day is a perfect time to be a little goofy with your sister. Wear matching outfits, or purchase silly hats for the both of you to wear when you go out in public. This is a great way to have a memorable Sister’s Day and to show off your unique relationship with your sister., If you and your sister have already decided on an activity, go out and enjoy yourself.

, Since you and your sister can’t share the day together, buying or making a gift is a great way to bridge the gap between the two of you.

Be sure that eloping is what you want to do.,
Set the date.",How to Elope1," If you feel pressured by your spouse-to-be or any other person, then the decision you make may not be the one you want. If budgetary concerns are causing problems, it is important to sit down and revise what is affordable for a wedding rather than simply running away from it. However, there are many good reasons for eloping, such as not wanting a big fuss, not wanting to handle difficult family get-togethers or simply not much liking the whole idea of weddings. What really matters is that you are both honest with yourselves and each other and that you agree that this is what both of you truly wants.


In some cases, certain family members may claim to be insulted by your decision to elope rather than include them in what they feel is an important family bonding occasion (you'll probably know which ones are likely to this way but you may also be surprised). Don't let their preferences decide yours––it's you who is getting married, not that family member.;
, Keep it quiet from family and friends where necessary. Alternatively, clue them in to the news if it isn’t meant as a secret and you know they're fine about missing the ""big event"".

"
"
Gather legal documents required by your state, province or country for obtaining your marriage license.,
Obtain the marriage license far enough in advance of the elopement date to account for any required waiting period.",How to Elope2," Depending on your location, this will include birth certificates, blood test results (if applicable) and previous divorce decree papers.

, In some cases, this part won't be necessary if you're eloping to a place already well set up for giving quick marriages, such as Las Vegas (see How to elope in Las Vegas).

"
"
Set your budget.,
Decide on the location of the elopement ceremony.",How to Elope3," Assess your available funds for items like flowers, special clothing, plane tickets and a photographer.

, If can be local or a distant honeymoon destination.


Gather two witnesses (or as many as required) and a justice of the peace or minister for a brief ceremony in the office of a judge or justice of the peace , at city hall, the courthouse or a small chapel. You can be back at work the next day if having a ceremony that is quiet and unobtrusive to your lives best fits your lifestyle.
Choose a location that holds sentimental meaning to both of you, such as the playground where you both played as kids, the produce section of the neighborhood grocery where you met, or on the courtyard of your college campus where you walked to class. Inexpensive, easy-in-easy-out locations provide for a quick but special elopement.
The iconic Las Vegas offers many wedding chapels and just about any costume and vehicle to rent for your special day or night.
Elope in a grand way, whisking your family and friends away to a secret destination where you allow a planner to handle the details. While official weddings are also done this way, the spontaneity of it all classifies it more as an elopement where you involve many witnesses for an impromptu celebration.

"
"
Celebrate afterwards with family and friends.,
Delay the celebration if it suits your situation.",How to Elope4," Still with low-key or no fuss and small budget expenditure in mind, find a suitable way to draw in the people who really matter for a small celebration after the fact. Some examples of what you might do include:


Host a backyard barbecue to celebrate the nuptials with those in your lives, surprising them with the announcement on napkins, signs or during a special toast.
Plan an intimate dinner party or cocktail gathering to announce your marriage.
Have a trusted friend plan a housewarming or money tree “come-and-go” that family and friends can attend to celebrate your new marriage.
Go for a game of golf or bowls with your family and friends, and have a picnic or easy lunch included.

, If you are inviting people who felt very let down by your elopement, there is a benefit in waiting before celebrating. A few possibilities include:


Consider waiting until it's time for a baby. You can celebrate both your baby's arrival and your wedding, by which time a lot of hurt will have mellowed and people will be more receptive (they can always make the excuse they're there for the baby).
If you don't plan on having children, waiting for an anniversary might be another option––time does heal, especially when the two of you are still clearly very much together.

Order your favorite cake flavor for the layer that you are going to cut.,
Choose a keepsake knife and spatula to cut your wedding cake so you can use them on your anniversaries.,
Discuss with your future spouse prior to the wedding how much pomp and circumstance you want the wedding cake cutting to involve.,
Cut the cake at whatever point during the reception that you are ready to serve dessert.,
Announce to your guests that you are getting ready to cut the wedding cake.,
Place the bride's hand around the knife and then the groom's right hand over hers and cut the cake together.,
Serve your parents their pieces of cake before the rest of the guests.,
Have the staff of your reception site serve the remainder of the cake to the rest of your guests.

",How to Cut Your Wedding Cake," Traditionally this is the bottom layer of the cake. Be aware that the little bite you feed to each other when you cut your wedding cake may be the only bite you get all night. You'll be sure to get a taste of your favorite flavor if the cutting layer is your top choice.;
, Ask your family if there are any heirloom utensils you can use to uphold a tradition.


You can have the knife and spatula engraved with your new initials or your wedding date.

, Some couples want to go the whole nine yards and shove cake in each other's faces, while other couples want to take a more tame approach and carefully feed their mate a tiny, neat bite. It is important to have this discussion before the wedding so there are no surprises during the big moment.


There is no set rule that you and your partner have to feed each other a bite of the cake. Maybe you'd like to cut the first whole piece of cake together and share it with a fork.
Some couples take turns to feed each other, while others do it simultaneously. The choice is yours.
Shoving the cake into your spouse's face is messy. It spoils the bride's makeup and risks staining the wedding gown. Many wedding etiquette books recommend against it.

, Cutting the cake usually occurs straight after the main meal, and there is no need to provide dessert unless you want to, as the cake fulfills this purpose. However, when you decide to cut the cake could vary depending on the structure of your reception, and some wedding venues encourage cake cutting just after the introductions to allow wait staff the time to plate the slices for serving.

, The cake cutting is a traditional moment at weddings and as such, it is one that your guests will want to witness and capture on video. Even if you don't intend on making it a big to-do, it's still important to let your guests be a part of the moment if they so wish.

, The actual cutting of the cake is more than just slicing off a piece of beautiful, delicious cake. The moment is also symbolic of your new life together, so it is important to do it together. If your cake has decorative ribbon, remove the ribbon in this area before cutting. Cut a ""V"" shape where the bottom point of the ""V"" is at the center of the cake. You only need to make 2 cuts and it is easier to remove.

, Personally serving your parents their pieces of cake gives you another moment to share with them on your big day. This would be a good time to include grandparents or other relatives and friends that you would like to single out by serving them a special piece of cake.

Return the question with a question.,
Divert the conversation.,
Turn the matter into a joke.,
Be dismissive in a polite enough way.,
Be honest.,
Discuss the topic with your partner ahead of being asked so that you can provide a united front.,
Keep your delivery light.",How to Deal With Questions About When You're Getting Married," Avoid trying to come off as being too obnoxious but one way of dealing with this intrusive question is to return their question with your own inquiry.


Ask the inquiring person when he or she is getting married (if the question comes from another single person). This may shed some light on how inappropriate the question may be, especially if the other person is in a similar situation. For example, say ""Aw, I don't know. How about you? Do you know when you are?""
Ask them forthrightly: When do you think we should get married? Put the questioner in the hot seat and ask when he or she thinks your marriage plans should be enacted. If they come back with the answer, “next year”, tell him or her you’ll take it under advisement, chuckle, and move on with the conversation.
Ask them when they got married, and make it all about them. For example: ""I don't know yet. But when did you get married? What sorts of things made you feel that the time was right? Did you have any regrets?"" And so forth. Thank them for their story afterward and tell them that you found it interesting. You might even mention that it has given you ideas, but only if you don't mind them coming back to you at a later date to ask how it's all going.
Answer with challenging questions so that they wished they never asked you. For example, say something like: ""Oh, we'd love to get married but we have such specific ideas for the perfect marriage, yet neither of us has anywhere near enough money saved. Did you know the average wedding costs at least twenty five thousand dollars and we're far from average and we need to at least double that to accommodate all the guests who'd like to celebrate the event and to make sure it's a day to remember? Mom and Dad have got to keep their retirement savings intact; we can't (or don't want to) eat into that. It's so hard just thinking about it but maybe you can help us work out how to save the fifty thousand dollars needed to have even a halfway decent wedding; I don't know, maybe you even have fifty thousand dollars to spare?"" After a spiel like that, they'll be itching to change the subject.
""Why should we?"" Bring that question up. Most people don't even think about why people get married. There are points for and against, many people prefer to keep renewing their commitment rather than deal with tax and legal entanglements.
""Why do you ask?"" This one can stop the entire topic, most people who ask are giving a scripted response and you'll get some amusing replies as they try to figure out why the pace of your personal life matters to them. It's especially good with people other than parents, who do have some vested interest in grandchildren.;
, There's nothing as evasively polite as somehow managing to miss the question and to return the conversation to something on more neutral ground. To do this, simply quickly turn the conversation to another topic. Be brief and friendly with your delivery, but then quickly ask the other person a question about him or herself, such as how his or her child is doing in school or if they finally finished the big home remodeling project.


One way to approach this is to extremely briefly acknowledge their question but then to quickly launch into the alternative topic. For example: ""Oh, no answer on that yet! But do tell me about how your sweet little children are. I heard they won prizes for their egg and spoon race last week!"" By dismissing the question briefly at the beginning and replacing it with an immediate question of interest to the questioner, then the conversation starts to naturally weave right away from your not-so-impending nuptials.
Try the someone's getting married approach. This is a neat distraction if you know of someone who is getting married known mutually to you and the questioner. For example, you could answer: ""Not yet, but did you hear? George and Simpson are getting married next August. Isn't that amazing?! I was so stoked to learn of their engagement!"" And then take the conversation somewhere else.
Ask about sports or something else that's completely off topic. Asking them something completely at odds with the question, such as ""Well now, how about that win of the Tigers (or any other sports team)?"" Doing this should send the message that you don’t want to talk about it. Diving immediately into a discussion about sports can quickly defuse talk of marriage, letting the other person know you aren’t in the mood.

, If you really want to dodge the question and have some fun with your question-asking victims, try a few quips or funny comebacks that will let them know you aren’t thinking marriage or anything in the neighborhood. Here are some possible answers:


""When it's legal for everyone to marry."" That turns the conversation political and makes both of you look moral for putting human rights ahead of your personal lives.
""When my divorce is final."" Whether this is true or not, bringing divorce into the situation may not be an appropriate response. However, depending on who is asking (such as your old college buddy or an annoying coworker), consider using this comeback to shut them down.
""Following the apocalypse."" Generally this will mean that you probably don't plan on getting married, but will be a humorous way to let people know.
""Hopefully before I start to show."" Not the ideal comeback for mom or grandma but could be funny if it’s a close friend or even an acquaintance asking the question.
""No comment."" Delivered right, this can be amusing.
""We'll get married when people stop asking us about it."" It makes the point.

, When you really want to ask someone to just stop prying so much into your personal life, simply say something like: ""Not yet, but be assured that when there's news, you'll be one of the first to know."" Use a tone of voice that is polite but says also ""End of story, no more conversation on this topic to be entered into."" Should the person comment further, trying to elicit something more from you, simply repeat the phrase: ""As I've already said, you'll be the first to know of any news.""

, If both of you have decided that you won't be getting married and that you're perfectly happy living together, living apart but dating, or whatever, then your best option may be to just say so. Answers suggested to the question include:


""We're not."" No more said.
""We're happy with things as they stand now. Neither of us feels the need to proceed down any other path at this point in time.""
""Oh, but we are in the eyes of the common law. That's sufficient for us!""
""We're trialing a long engagement. We hate surprises.""
""We handfasted. Renewing it annually is a truer commitment.""

, The easiest way to be caught off guard is to not have a plan. Even if you are simply not ready or don’t know, act as though you are the press secretary at the White House and prepare a canned statement that will politely stop the questions.


Be honest about how you feel. If you want to get married, let your sweetheart know. However, be open to how he or she is feeling, too. Perhaps your partner wants to finish school or save more money before taking this step; regardless of the reason, take his or her stand on the topic into consideration when formulating your response.
Be sure to cover the topic before attending a family function such as a wedding. The “go to” question at a wedding will inevitably be about your own impending nuptials! Accept that there will be questions so you will both need to deliver a united response.
Talk out how you plan to respond together and arrive at a mutually agreed-upon rebuttal. Whether you plan to be direct or coy, make sure you both are on board with the response and feel comfortable delivering the comments to nearly anyone.

, Don’t get offended or act defensive, even if it’s the fourth person that evening asking. Be friendly but make sure the questioner understands that you don’t plan on going into the matter beyond your (prepared) statement.

Plan well in advance.,
Start looking for ideas.,
Know the traditional and alternative wedding cake choices.,
Decide on your budget.,
Visit the bakers and caterers who specialize in weddings and that seem like good choices to you.,
Draw up your own plans for a cake.,
Choose your baker.",How to Choose a Wedding Cake," Unless you already have a firm idea of the kind of cake you'd like, there will need to be time to look around at options, as well as booking the cake creator, allocating the funds, and finding any special decorative elements. So be sure to give yourself plenty of planning time. Be aware that cake makers who are in high demand can be booked out during the high summer season, so don't leave your booking too late if marrying at this time., While your wedding theme might automatically suggest the type of wedding cake, this won't always be self-evident or in line with your other preferences. When choosing a cake style, consider looking at the following research resources:


Read wedding magazines that feature cakes
Look online at wedding cake ideas
Look in baker's displays, particularly those who specialize in cakes and fine pastry making
Look in old family photos for cake ideas (especially nice if you want to carry on a tradition).

, The following cakes are among those considered appropriate for the wedding context. While a big, complicated single cake perfectly covered in frilly frosting or smooth fondant may be beyond a typical home baker's skill, several cheery alternatives aren't!


Tiered fruitcake with marzipan (traditional): This is the standard type of wedding cake that has a long history behind it, and is said to be modeled on London's Bride's Church (England)This cake is rich and not everyone likes the taste or the formality of this kind of cake.

Cupcake wedding cake (alternative): This kind of cake has gained a lot of followers in recent years. It's a tower of cupcakes that are usually in different flavors. The frosting can include many different types of symbols, initials, flowers, fruits, etc. as preferred. While many bakers are happy to make this kind of cupcake, this style is also great for a wedding reception planned for home as the cupcakes can be made easily in advance and frosted by generous family members just prior to the wedding. Or, buy them in bulk pre-frosted, and add a few finishing touches!

The tiered stand is widely sold as a ""cupcake tree"".



Croquembouche (French traditional): This high cone of profiteroles with a cascade of toffee (to which can be added sugared/candied almonds, chocolate, flowers, ribbons, etc.). This cake can usually serve around 30–40, so if you have more guests, consider several croquembouche. As a form of dessert, Croquembouche takes care of the dessert menu, which can be an excellent solution for a tight budget. As a delicate cake, you need to be assured of careful delivery.

Chocolate cake (French): Chocolate cake has had an avid following at weddings for quite a while now and the French wedding cake is lavishly decorated with a lace style.The relevant baker would be a French patisserie.
Cheesecake: For the bride and groom who don't much like cake, a Cheesecake is an option. This isn't a cheesecake, it's a layer of cheeses!One large cheese disk is on the base, with smaller cheese layers working their way to the top. Flowers and other decorations are added to the cheese layers. This can work out to be much cheaper than a traditional wedding cake but still lets you have the ""layers"".
Theme cake: There is a definite tradition of theme cakes for geek weddings. Cakes from Star Wars, Star Trek, and other sci-fi flicks are not unusual, as are cakes from beloved themes such as manga, anime, Hello Kitty, and anything that takes the fancy of the bride and groom. This sort of cake will come naturally to you if both of you are huge fans of something!

Cookies. A lavish ""cookie table"" assortment, often carefully arranged, is a Pittsburgh-area tradition.. It could accompany a simpler cake, and many people can contribute without needing to coordinate efforts much in advance.

, Once you've got some idea of the type of cake you'd like, you'll need to work out how much money you have to spend on the cake. Be realistic and compare the prices of various cake vendors. When it gets down to the time of choosing the baker, you can ask for quotes and then compare these and ask for discounts where appropriate.

, Ask to see their portfolios of cake ideas. Ask them to show you photographs of previous cakes. Don't rush this step–take time to compare and contrast the different styles and specialties provided by each baker.


Ask for demonstrations of decorative elements such as writing in chocolate if you're not sure.
Always ask to taste their cake. You need to know if the bakery's cakes have the texture and flavor you like. Even if it's a place you already purchase from, ask for a taste of their more recent cakes, in case anything has changed such as ingredients or methods. Good bakeries will offer a small selection to taste from.

, Once you have decided which bakers' creations you like the most, take your ideas along to them and discuss these. Ask about the difficulty, the possibilities, the costs. At this point, you should be able to start getting a good idea of what type of cake you can realistically have, and which of the bakers is most likely to achieve this for you.


Tell the baker how many people the cake has to serve. The more guests, the larger the cake needed.
Be very clear on your budget with the baker. If you cannot afford all the options you'd like, your baker will be able to advise you on what can be done within your budget.

, Keep working with the baker regularly to improve and adjust your cake ideas. Ask for sample mock-ups to help you through the process. Be sure to let your baker know about decoration and design wishes, and if you intend on providing any of the cake decorations, get these to the baker on time.

Step out into the fresh air.,
Do something you have never done before.,
Go on an adventure with a friend.,
Do something sporty.",How to Spend One's Holidays Without Getting Bored1," Simple outdoor pleasures are highly underrated. Not only is a quick trip out of the house invigorating and mood-lifting, but also a great opportunity for exercise. If you have been thinking of reducing those bulges, then go out and jog, walk or do any outdoor physical activity you enjoy.


If the weather is bad or you do not want to go out, then go to the gym or do sit-ups inside the house as a form of exercise.;
, If you have been thinking of doing something and never have the time to do it, then do it. Do not waste your time sitting in front of the TV and watching reruns over and over when you could be broadening your horizons with a brand-new experience. Below are just a few ideas:


Trying a new kind of food
Checking out a new club or hang-out spot
Playing a new sport
Exploring a new area of wilderness.

, Grab a companion and try to find cool new places to explore. Visit a town you have never been to, or go for a walk in the woods. Remember to practice good safety habits when exploring a new area and take a charged mobile phone with you.

, You can ride your bike, walk, play your favorite sport or even try a new one. Any of these sorts of activities are a good way to get healthy.

Throw a party.",How to Spend One's Holidays Without Getting Bored3," If you can't think of things to do, one of your friends probably can. When all else fails, simply try going for picnics or hanging out at a shopping mall with your friends. A sleepover is another great idea.

, If you have nothing you need to do for yourself, you may want to volunteer to help someone else. Ask friends and relatives if they have any projects they need help on, and, if so, offer your services!

, The holidays are a great opportunity to have rare, cherished conversations with family members you haven't seen for a long time. For instance, you might want to visit your grandparents and have a quality talk with them. You might be surprised how funny and insightful some of your very own relatives have become without your noticing.

, Time with a cherished animal friend is underrated, especially if it's with one you haven't seen for a while. Your pet (or pets) probably miss you if you've been gone, so spend a little time walking them, playing with them, etc. A pet's unconditional love can be a great mood-booster if you've become oppressively bored over the holidays.

, If there's no one around that you'd like to spend time with, don't forget that you always have the option of making new friends. You might choose to do this at a social hang-out spot like a club, or, alternatively, at an event like a concert. Don't be afraid to approach and talk to people you meet - new friendships have to start somewhere!


You'll never make new friends from inside your home, so get out there! Getting out of the house is the most crucial, pivotal step in turning a boring holiday into a fun, productive one.

, Having a party is a great way to have fun. You can invite your friends and have a fiesta themed on the weather. If it's sunny, have it beach themed. If it's cold, you and your friends can stay inside and have a nice cup of cocoa.

Get chores and tasks out of the way.",How to Spend One's Holidays Without Getting Bored6," The holidays are one of the few times each year when most people have lots of free time. If you have no pressing commitments with family or friends, consider using your time to finish duties that you've been putting off for a long time.

Be clued in as to who gets invited from the start.,
If you're on the fence about whether your own family members will behave during the wedding, it's a little touchy to assume the worst and fairly inflammatory to make direct comments about your worries about how they might behave at your wedding.,
Discuss the possibility of the unruly guest with your wedding planner or event coordinator.,
Consider a cash bar and/or a limited alcohol service.,
Be smart about seating arrangements.,
Allot a very trusted friend or group of friends to act as wedding and reception guardians.",How to Deal With Unruly Guests at Your Wedding1," Invite friends, family members and essential acquaintances whom you can be sure you can trust. In some cases, you mightn't have a clue but try to use what you do know about the guests to help you make sound decisions. If possible, make an initial list of everyone you want to invite. Then, go back through the list and identify any potential problems that could crop up between guests. Possible troublemakers include:


Friends and family with a terrible sense of a humor but a conviction that their humor is fantastic. Never, ever give such people speech duties. Keep them in a dark corner somewhere, well plied with groupies to soak up their jokes.
Troubled friends/family members. What you define by ""troubled"" is up to you––it could include someone who has recently divorced, someone who is feeling depressed about being single, or someone who just hates a party, no matter the reason. But whatever is causing their troubles, if a wedding is going to set them off in tears, maudlin recriminations, nostalgically tragic flashbacks to better times, etc., then you'll need to consider whether it's even kind to invite them. If you do invite them, you might like to tee up a sporting friend or family member to give them a good pep talk beforehand, or to hold their hand during the occasion.
Tipsy to downright alcohol-guzzling family or friends. If you know that a friend or family member tends to drink too much and becomes just a bit too crazy at social events, you're walking on thin ice. Damned if you invite them, damned if you don't because over-enthusiastic social drinkers rarely see the problem and will likely be offended. While you could consider the possibility of leaving them off the list, it might just be easier to give them a stern talk about staying away from more than the champagne toast and give them a buddy to watch over the sly extras.
Exes. Not inviting your or your fiancé’s ex may be the brightest idea if you want to avoid controversy and/or trouble. But if for some reason you feel you need to, then check out How to invite your ex to the wedding for the lowdown on fording off potential issues.
Acquaintances or work friends. In some cases, inviting work colleagues or the boss is considered to be the right thing to do. However, ponder or find out what the acquaintance or work friend’s party personality is like in a social context––if they have a track record of getting too wild, speaking out of turn or being a party pooper, you might want to find a polite excuse for not inviting them, such as that you're limiting the party to very close friends and family (that way, no one at work will have their feelings hurt).;
, You do need to be tactful and yet, you don't want them throwing a tantrum mid-vows or getting soused and falling on the reception marquee and bringing it down on everyone's heads. Think laterally and stay compassionate; the diplomatic approach might be to resort to sideways tactics, such as making things easier for this person, like personalized transportation, an early-home taxi, or a special seat at an ""important persons"" table to give them a sense of responsibility. Or, you could try buttering up someone you trust implicitly whom you know can control the potentially difficult person or who at least can get them out of the way should anything untoward arise. (See below for forming a force of ""wedding guardians"".)

, If you're anticipating the possibility that someone could become disruptive, discuss this notion while you are planning your wedding. Wedding coordinators and event planners have plenty of experience handling the occasional unruly guest so if they're aware that this is a possibility, they can plan accordingly by adding extra staff or even incognito bodyguards if necessary. It may be worth the additional cost to keep things running without a very personal hiccup.

, One way to avoid letting people get too nutty is to cut back or reduce the amount of alcohol being served, at least at your expense. While some folks will feel a little down about not having an “all you can drink” open bar, limiting guest’s alcohol intake will lend itself to keeping people in line and not letting their inhibitions or guard down.


Be aware that if you decide to have a no-alcohol wedding (whether this is due to religious beliefs, your budget, or suspected rampant alcoholism, is totally your business), you will hear some complaints. However, stick to your decision––whose wedding is it, after all? The detractors won't die from a lack of alcohol in the short time that is your wedding and they can always drop into the pub or a bar on the way back home if they're so parched. You could even be magnanimous and let them know where the local pubs and bars are located, should they wish to toast to your good health post-wedding.

, This is one area over which you have complete control. And it never does to sit exes with exes or friends who have had a falling out together. Use your knowledge of your guests to make the best choices for seating people together (you can even do a bit of match-making) and keep apart any guests likely to start a heated argument between each other. If you're not sure, ask other friends or family members for their knowledge about who gets along with whom and who doesn't.

, In the movies, this is always a solid group of friends of either the bride or groom who picks up the sobbing or drunk number of the group and ferries him or her away unnoticed in a flurry of compassion for both the wedding party and the troublemaker. However, don't leave things to chance. While your friends may know to respond quickly, they may also not know what to do. Talk to your trusted few about how you would appreciate them handling anything that gets out of hand to ensure that it is dealt with tactfully, carefully and swiftly, before it blows into something that everyone notices.


Think twice about asking family members to be on the look out for other less well-behaved family members. If this would calm the offender, then by all means, do so. But if you're concerned that family intervention could actually escalate the problem behavior, rely on more neutral friends or carers to help out instead.
One good thing to suggest to your wedding guardians is to identify exactly what the guest(s) is doing to be disruptive and be specific about what action you’d like taken given a range of possible situations. In most cases, removing the guest may be the best solution, however if guests are simply being a little too loud or boisterous, simply asking them to “tone it down” may be sufficient.

Realize this––as bride and groom, you will be too busy to be wrapped up in dealing with missing guests, angry guests, crazy guests, or guests with attitude problems.,
Forget no-shows on the day.,
Don’t panic if someone gets too crazy at your wedding or your reception.,
Take into account the hour when the guest(s) have become unruly.",How to Deal With Unruly Guests at Your Wedding2," You absolutely must let go personally and let other kind people take the flak and fix the problems for you. Hence, this is why it is important to have some of your trusted party alerted to taking on this role. Some of this role should also be devolved to bridesmaids and groomsmen. Things not to do as bride and groom:


Avoid running around wondering where cousins Fred and Sierra have managed to get lost on the way to the wedding. That's entirely your cousins' problem, not yours.
Making comments about lateness or rude behavior as part of your speech is a complete no-no. This is a day for happiness, enjoyment of the moment and glazing over at any mishap.
Personal mercy dashes to anyone who loses it because they wished they'd married you/hate weddings/wish you'd never sat them next to an ex or a particular relative, and so on and so forth. At the time of the wedding, they are no longer your problem; let someone else deal with it.

, Whether or not you could term this type of guest as ""unruly"" is debatable but if their absence leaves a gaping hole and causes others to whisper loudly, then it's possibly disruptive and if it causes you personal distress, then it is disruptive. It's probable that someone besides you is worried, annoyed or bothered about this absence. Let that person do the worrying and chasing up for you. In terms of your own response, save that for after the wedding, when the missing guests had better hope their excuse is a good one.



After the wedding or honeymoon, and before losing your temper with a no-show, be aware that their absence may have been as the result of an accident, a family death or a natural disaster. All other reasons probably smack of shirking responsibility, especially if they forgot or couldn't handle the thought of meeting an ex, and you're justified in being just a bit peeved.

, You've done your best to vet possible issues, you've shored up some trusted people to handle anything haywire and yet, someone still slips through the net and declares that the wedding can't go ahead because they're still deeply in love with you or they're claiming the groom's a clone from outer space. Breathe deeply, stay calm and keep smiling. In other words, carry on.


Alert venue staff and attendants that there is a ""big problem"" that they need to deal with immediately. Briefly explain what is happening, who the person is and ask them to kindly deal with it, as fast as they can.
Wink or whatever else it is you've agreed upon, at your trusted group. Set them in action to ""fix things"".
Avoid letting family members who already have issues with the unruly guest get involved. This will only cause to escalate the situation and turn a small disturbance into a possible farce. Either go back to the trusted friends or to staff; the more neutral the people dealing with the unruly guest, the better. If you have someone from outside the party handling the manner, the unruly guest may be more likely to either calm down or simply leave.

, If the party is almost over, everything is winding down and you're about to skip off to Patagonia for the honeymoon, then the harm is probably well and truly passed. If the behavior is more celebratory, you may want to try to ignore it and let them have their fun; it might even be an amusing or (nicely) memorable end to the evening. On the other hand, if the behavior means that the party is getting too revved up and there's a risk of harm to the venue or other people, get help fast to put a stop to it.

Cushioning is key.,
Wrap each individual item separately when packing more than one item in the same box.,
Fragile Gift?,
Remove batteries from electronic devices and wrap separately.,
Pack In the Address.,
Shake the box to see if there is enough cushioning.,
Seal It Tight.,
Remember to make the shape of the letter “H” when securing corners, flaps and edges together.

,
Keep the gift wrap Inside the Box.,
Mark packages ""Fragile"" in large print or using a ""FRAGILE"" shipping label on the outside of the package when sending items that could be damaged or broken.

,
Label It Right.,
Think about using a different destination.,
Don’t Miss a Christmas Moment.,
Request ""A Signature Upon Delivery"".",How to Send Packages for Christmas," Examine your gift – is it sturdy, fragile, box-like or have small moving pieces? Use bubble wrap to cushion any odd angles to make them less fragile during transit. Is your item shallow or hollow inside, like a vase or bowl, fill that space to make it more dense – packing peanuts, bubble wrap or firmly crumpled unprinted newsprint all work!;
, Use a new, sturdy cardboard box that’s a few inches larger than your gift on all sides to allow for plenty of cushioning. If reusing a box, make sure it’s still strong enough to stand up to shipping (no torn flaps, no holes or corner dents, no water-damage, etc.). And be sure to remove all old shipping labels.

, Protect your gifts by using at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) layers (preferably 2 inches) of cushioning around the item – top, bottom and all four sides.

, Consider sending more than one package if one item might compromise the integrity of something more fragile.

, Got a super-breakable item to ship? Use two boxes. Cushion your item with at least three inches of packing peanuts or other cushioning material, and seal it in a box. Place that box within a second, slightly larger box, with another layer of cushioning. All that added padding is added protection for your fragile item.

, Secure them so that they are not ""floating"" around. You may even consider taping them to the inside panel of the box and leaving a note on the gift so that the batteries don't accidentally get tossed into the garbage.

, Sometimes winter weather can strike and remove shipping labels. Paperwork can get lost from pouches. Just in case, always put an extra shipping label, business card, or letterhead with the shipper and recipient’s address information inside your box before sealing things up.

, Start with a gentle shake and continuing to increase the intensity to the point that you think it would be handled by someone who doesn't know what's inside and is under pressure to get as many packages moving along as possible. If items move, add more cushioning.

, Keeping winter elements out of your box is easy. Just seal all the flaps and seams using proper packing tape. No duct tape or masking tape!

,, Don’t ""wrap"" your shipping box. We admire that you wrap your gifts with care and thought, but ribbon, bows and wrapping paper can get caught in sorting machines! If you want your gift to be wrapped, wrap it first, then place it in the shipping box.

,, One of the best ways to ensure your package gets to its destination on time is with proper labeling. When using a shipping label, airbill, or airway bill, fill it out completely and accurately. When using a shipping label, press it firmly to make sure it adheres to the shipping box. When using a packing list envelope, make sure the peel-off strip has been removed and the flap is firmly sealed. Place the shipping labels or packing slip envelope on the largest flat continuous surface of the box, avoiding any area that has a bend or place where the box is not complete like a seam or flap.

, When ordering something online, consider sending the gift to where you work, or to a relative, friend or trusted neighbor. Obviously make sure they are going to be at home and not out of town.

, When in doubt, contact the pros. Your gifts need to be ready, as much as possible, prior to shipping to ensure on-time delivery to their destination. certain gifts are just too precious to trust to just anyone. Your gift might be a really odd shape or have unusual dimensions.

, Most packages are sent without needing a signature. If you’re shipping something of high value – or you just want to be sure items aren’t left on a door step or out front of a residence or building – make sure that a signature is mandatory for packages to be released. The shipper or the recipient can make this request

Remove the filter and drain from your dishwasher. Clean the drain. Do a clean cycle while it is empty with some white vinegar to remove minerals.
Take your knives to be sharpened or sharpen them yourself. Your knives will be in high demand, so do this a few weeks before holiday season officially starts to ensure they are sharp enough for all your holiday cooking and carving.
Check your smoke alarms and the expiration date on your fire extinguisher. Most accidents occur in the home, so make sure you always have an extinguisher on hand. Replace smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector batteries at regular intervals, such as right before the busy holiday season.
Deep clean your microwave and refrigerator. Throw away anything that is past its expiration to make room for holiday food. Save the oven cleaning until after the holidays, because a self-cleaning feature can be tough on the oven and you'll have to do it in January anyway.

Remind yourself of your priorities for the holidays.,
Determine why you’re setting boundaries.,
Decide where to draw the line.,
Be mindful of your actions and feelings.,
Take your time making decisions.",How to Set Boundaries During the Holidays1," It can be easy to feel that everything is important, exciting, and necessary during the buzz of the holidays. From attending the office holiday party, to making sure every gift has a hand-tied bow, it can seem like everything is a priority. However, having a clear idea of what’s important to you will help you determine what boundaries you need to set during this time.Make a list of the most important things in your life. For example, you might write, “family, career, and health” on your list.
You may want to include those things that make the holidays meaningful for you like giving to others, spending time with loved ones, or reflecting on life.;
, It can be tempting to say, “I’m going to spend less” or “I’m not going to eat too much” without having a clear goal in mind that explains why you’re setting this limit. Knowing why you’re setting a certain limit can help you set the boundary and stick to it.Think about your priorities and what you need to do to maintain them. For example, you might think, “I’m setting boundaries with my eating because being a healthy weight is important to me.”
Or, for example, you might say to yourself, “I’m setting limits on how much I work because I want to spend time with my loved ones.”
If it helps, write your reasons for setting boundaries down so that you can refer to them when you need a quick reminder of why you set limits during the holidays.

, Before you can set boundaries during the holidays (or any other time) you have to decide what the boundary will be.Think about your reasons for setting boundaries and what a reasonable limit will be.


For example, you might think, “Spending $10 on each gift will mean I spend $100 on gifts. I really don’t have that much to spare. Maybe I can spend $5 per gift. That’s more reasonable.”
Or, you might decide, for instance, that you can cut back your work hours from 45 a week to 35 during the holidays without risking your career or financial security.
You might also decide that you want to attend one holiday event per weekend, and no more. You may find it easier to say ""no"" to someone when you have already booked something for that weekend.
Or, you might decide that spending time with friends is more important to you, and try to shop ahead of the holidays to free up your time.

, This means being aware of what you’re thinking, how you feel, and what you are doing at all times. It means paying attention to your body, as well as keeping in mind the goals and commitments you made. Being mindful can help you become aware of when you need to set boundaries and what limits you may need to set during the holidays. Being mindful can help you be aware of signals your body is giving you that you may need to set a boundary or reconsider a decision. For example, if your stomach clenches when your co-worker invites you to a holiday party, you may need to think before saying “yes.” If you refer to your list, then you can say, ""I'd love to, but I already have an engagement that weekend. Thanks so much for including me.""
Or, for example, being mindful of your holiday spending limits can help prevent you from spending too much on decorations and presents.

, During the hustle and bustle of the holiday season it can be easy to give into impulse and spur-of-the-moment decisions that you may regret later. Instead, slow down and take your time when you’re making decisions. Doing this will give you time to think about what you’re doing and whether it’s something you want to do.


For example, instead of automatically saying, “Sure” when someone asks if you’ll do them a favor, take the time to find out what the favor is first. You can say, ""I will check my calendar when I get home. I have a lot of things planned during the holidays and can't keep track of them all.""
Or, for instance, wait 10 minutes before having a second helping of holiday dinner to make sure that you’re really still hungry.

Hang a wreath.,
Put down a nice rug.,
Make sure there is adequate light.,
Add some holiday décor.",How to Prepare Your Front Entry Space for Holiday Guests1," Before guests even enter your home, you can set the scene for a fun and festive holiday gathering by hanging a tasteful wreath. You can purchase a wreath from home decoration stores (such as Target, L.L.Bean, or Michael’s). Or you can make one yourself. Use colors that compliment the color of your door, and opt for simple elegance, not busy opulence.Look for a wreath in a solid color (such as classic green, silver, or red) with simple embellishments (such as berries, bells, or a single bow).
Too many colors or too much flare can make your wreath seem over the top.;
, Consider the look of your entryway floor. Putting down a rug can be both a nice-looking and practical choice. It gives your guests someplace to remove snow-covered boots, but it can also add color and style to your entryway.Choose bold colors and patterns that are less likely to show dirt.
Look for rugs at stores such as Target, Kohl’s, or Bed Bath and Beyond.

, Think about the lighting in your entryway. You want to create a warm, flattering glow while providing enough light to enter safely. Consider using two light sources to create this balance. Place a medium-wattage bulb in an available overhead light fixture, then add a standing lamp with softer bulb., Adding a few holiday decorations to your entryway can set a warm and festive tone. A great choice is a holiday plant (such as a poinsettia, a small tree, or any plant spruced up with holiday lights). Another good option is to trim the space with garland. Finally, if you have a shelf in your entryway, consider placing a small holiday accessory there (such as a a candle or ceramic snowman). Depending on the size of your entryway, you should probably choose just 2 out of these 3 options so it doesn't seem overwhelming."
"
Change your perspective.,
Write it down.,
Make it hard to cross the boundary.,
Encourage and reward yourself.",How to Set Boundaries During the Holidays2," The word ‘boundaries’ can sometimes seem negative. Instead of thinking of it as a boundary you are setting for yourself during the holidays, think of it as a holiday goal you are setting.Changing your perspective and taking a positive attitude about it can make it easier for you to stick to your limits.


For example, instead of thinking, “I’m going to limit myself to one dessert a week,” you might think, “My goal is to have less than two desserts each week.”
Or, for instance, rather than saying, “I can only spend $10 on each gift,” you could say, “I’m going to see how many meaningful gifts I can buy for $10 or less.”

, Some studies suggest that writing down your goals can help you achieve them.Similarly, writing down your holiday boundaries for yourself can help remind you of them and encourage you to stick to them.


Make a list of the specific areas that you want to set boundaries and limits for this holiday season. For instance, you might write, “spending, working, sleeping enough, and partying.”
Write a specific goal for each area. For example, “Complete all reports without working overtime the week of Christmas.”
Keep your list with you or post it somewhere you can see frequently to remind yourself of what your boundaries are.

, Sometimes you may have trouble sticking to limits that you set for yourself because it’s simply too easy not to stick to them. Putting some creative obstacles in place is a good way to make it hard not to cross the boundaries that you set for yourself.


For example, if you keep your credit cards in the front of your wallet, it’s easy for you to whip them out for a quick, unplanned purchase. Try storing them in your spare wallet, in your coat, in your closet. Or, you can try using cash for all of your in-store purchases. Then you will spend what you actually have instead of charging it onto your credit cards.
Or, for instance, you might place the fruitcake your aunt sent you behind the carrots, celery, and lime water in the refrigerator. This way you have several healthy choices before the cake.

, One way to stick to the limits you set for yourself is to regularly give yourself a pat on the back.Encouraging yourself can help you maintain a positive attitude about your boundaries and goals, while rewarding yourself can help give you an incentive for doing so.


For instance, before going into a holiday party you might think to yourself, “I can eat less than six pastries tonight and if I do, I can have an eggnog latte tomorrow morning.”
Or, for example, if you turn down a holiday get together because you need to work on a project you might reward yourself with a relaxing bath.

Practice saying ‘no.’ It can be hard to say ‘no’ during the holidays for a number of reasons.,
Be calm.,
Be clear.",How to Set Boundaries During the Holidays3," Perhaps, it’s that the holidays are seen as time of giving and goodwill. Maybe it’s because it’s also a time of excitement and excess. But, you can set limits with others and say ‘no’ if you practice doing so.Ask someone close to you to help you role play some situations in which you might need to set limits and say ‘no.’ For example, you might ask your sister to help you role play saying no to party invitations.
Make a list of different ways you can politely, but firmly say ‘no’ and set limits with others. For instance, you might write, “I can tell Sandy I have too much to do to visit for two weeks.”

, When you are setting boundaries with other people during the holidays, or any other time, you want to do it as peacefully and stress-free as possible for everyone. Remaining calm can make it easier for you to express your reasons for setting limits. It can also make it easier for the person to understand and respect them.For example, instead of yelling, “Are you serious?” when your partner asks for an extravagant gift, you might calmly say, “That’s not in my budget this year. Can you think of something that costs a bit less?”
Or, for instance, you might say, “No, I’m sorry I don’t have time” when your co-worker invites you to another holiday party instead of saying, “Don’t you see all the work I have to do?”

, When you are setting boundaries with others you need to make sure that they understand what the limits are. You can do this by being clear and direct with them rather than trying to soften things.For instance, instead of saying, “I’m not sure if I’ll be able to go to the holiday lunch,” you could say, “I won’t be attending the lunch this year. I simply don’t have time.”
Or, for example, if your boss asks you to work overtime you might say, “I can’t because of other obligations I have right now,” instead of saying, “Let me check my calendar.” It's human nature to want to put off difficult things, but it is actually easier to just be direct and honest up front, such as the first time someone asks you if you are sure of your position.

Take a cold shower.",How to Reduce the Temptation of Food During Ramadan," Although watching television isn't prohibited during Ramadan, you may stumble upon food advertisements, example: McDonald's. If you must watch television, make sure that the program you're watching won't feature any food related advertisements and also make sure that what you're watching doesn't contain any prohibited imagery. Example: porn, sexual stimuli, etc. You can watch programs such as cartoons or news.
, The one place in your house where food is just a refrigerator door away is the kitchen. That means no entry and no opening the fridge to indulge in that luscious dairy treat you've been melting for! *hint hint*. The second you enter the kitchen, your intention to fast will be lost faster than your good deeds., What better way to pass the duration of your fast than to pray your five-time a day prayer and read the book of god? This way, you'll be staying away from the temptation of food/bad behavior and at the same time get reward., Doing anything that is objectionable according to the Qur'an is something that displeases Allah S.W.T. Attempt to seek forgiveness for the things you've previously done by making du'aa., Sleeping is possibly the BEST thing for you to do while you're fasting for numerous reasons. Examples: sleeping while fasting means you don't gain sin AND reserve your body energy., Cool off during the hottest time of year by taking a cold shower. You'll feel cool, refreshed and for the most part, being clean is one of the duties of being a good Muslim. You'll also pass more time, avoiding food in the process."

Just before midnight, the Russian President addresses the nation with a short speech in which he reflects on the past year and thanks the people for their support. Right after the speech, the chiming clock on the Kremlin’s Spasskaya Tower is shown counting down the last few seconds of the year.

,


Local Russians bid farewell to the old year by counting the chimes of the Kremlin Spasskaya Clock Tower. This is broadcast in the moments before the commencement of the New Year. If you are not in Moscow for New Years, get to a public place to watch this broadcast or on television, and in any case after the chimes end sing the National Anthem of Russia. For those outside Russia the Presidential address and the playing of the chimes and the anthem can be watched on cable channel RT.

Grandfather Frost – instead of Santa, Russian children believe in the no less mythical Grandfather Frost who wears a long blue or red fur coat, a matching hat and felt boots and carries gifts in a large sack on his back. In addition to the sack with gifts, Grandfather Frost carries a magical staff that has the power to freeze everything around him. Unlike Santa, Grandfather Frost doesn’t rely on reindeer to fly him around, but instead walks and skies a lot (no potbelly!) or drives his magical team of three horses.
It is traditional to place two figurines of Grandfather Frost's and his granddaughter, the Snow Maiden, under all Christmas trees.

Buy the required sacrificial animal 1-2 months in advance.,
Look after the sacrificial animal.,
Prepare invitations for your loved family and friends to your Eid party.,
Call a local meat butcher.,
Clear enough space for the sacrifice (if it is being done at your house).

,
Decide (or order) your Eid clothes!,
Prepare dishes for the occasion!,
Set a proper schedule for Eid day.,
Make final checks before Eid day.,As Eid day commences, review your schedule and remember to spend the day with remembrance of its religious importance.",How to Prepare for EID Ul Azha," Doing things in advance saves you so much time. Buy the animal from a verified bazaar or shop or seller. Check for the necessities in the animal as per the Islamic Shariah. Ask an Islamic scholar for help if you are unsure of the type of animal to buy for sacrifice, or read the Quran for further information. Alternately, check online for quick information , Once the animal(s) has been bought, make sure you feed it properly, and allow it to have regular walks to keep it in good shape, especially if you have bought it early on before the Eid date. Don't forget to feed and water it mainly. Also, nurture it. The main essence of Eid is to sacrifice what you love towards God's (Allah's) way. Hence the more attached you become to the animal, the more reward God will grant you. Spend time with your animal. But do not let it hinder with your basic daily activities.

, Make beautiful cards, or just get pre-prepared ones from the shop. There are lovely Eid invitation cards present in numerous markets across the globe. Make an invitation list, consulting your spouse and children on the matter, and set cards for each guest. Then send them at least 1-2 weeks BEFORE Eid day so that your guests have ample time to prepare and decide themselves too! This way you won't overwhelm anyone else nor yourself, as a week before you'll know exactly who's coming and how many people you'll need to arrange for.

, This can either be a private butcher or a butchery shop that runs special sacrificial butchery for the occasion. Be quick to book any butcher, as the longer you take, the more hectic it will be to find a good butcher! Also, let your guests know whether the butchery will be done at your own house so they can bring their animals too. If not, they should know to come AFTER they've sacrificed their own animals.

,, You need to be cleanly and properly dressed for this blessed occasion, and so need to either decide on a beautiful dress or buy it. You could also get it stitched privately and in that case will need to do it with plenty of time for the tailor to sew it. Many tailors and shops close in for Eid early on, so be prepared before-hand (at least 2 weeks).

, Obviously, you will not be able to prepare meat dishes as the meat will not be available until after the sacrifice is done (which is on Eid day). However, you can prepare the sweet dishes according to your own national culture (for e.g--Pakistan: Kheer). You have to be careful to only do the preparation, but not the actual cooking so to not let any dish go bad the day you have to serve it! There are some dishes that can be prepared though. Keep track of the menu, and make necessary arrangements. Rent a cook for a few days for the preparation and the actual cooking on Eid day, just for the special occasion (if you do not already have one capable enough). Food is an important part of the event, so make sure you are prepared to feed those hungry guests!

, A few days before Eid, make a timetable with your spouse and run it through with the family. This will avoid any confusions on the big day!

, Make sure your clothes are ironed, the butcher has been informed, the cook knows the menu (or if you're cooking yourself, you have prepared the menu), the animals are tied safely and everyone has been informed.,"

In the United States the wedding industry is a huge economic force: every year people spend $165 billion on 2.4 million weddings. ;
, Although there is a huge market for wedding planners to capture, it’s good to acquaint yourself with what it will require of you to be a good wedding planner.


It offers a lot of flexibility and control over your time.You’ll work non-conventional hours. Your clients will likely work 9-to-5 jobs, meaning you'll be meeting with them in the evening and on weekends. Since most weddings take place on Saturdays, you’ll work lots of weekends. , Planning weddings is a highly competitive business and comes with many demands in addition to benefits.


It requires a wide array of knowledge. You’ll need to know how to manage a successful business, pick good suppliers, navigate through one ""crisis"" after another, and work with inevitable interpersonal dynamics. In spite of everything, it can be extremely rewarding. Taking part in someone’s special day is very satisfying, but it's every bit as demanding as it is rewarding.
Weddings are always very emotional. You’ll deal with easy-going family members and vendors, but you'll also encounter the occasional bridezilla and micro-managing mothers and friends. It’s physically demanding. You’ll be on your feet for 10-to-15 hours during the wedding. You may have to lift and move furniture and boxes. You may have to help a drunk guest to a chair. , It takes 2-to-4 years to reach profitability. It will take some time to build your client base and accumulate experience and references, all required to be profitable. , After you have learned some of the basic facts of the wedding industry and being a wedding planner, think about whether pursuing this career path is right for you and your lifestyle.


Are you able to handle the physical demands? Do you like your weekends free? Can you be available for your clients at all times, in some cases even when you’re on vacation?

, Client and vendor management is a significant part of the job.


Can you handle the emotional demands? Are you able to deal positively with all sorts of people? Are you shy or extroverted? You’ll need to be able to interact constructively with almost anyone. , The range in income for wedding planners is anywhere from $15,000 a year to more than $100,000 a year, depending your reputation, how you advertise, where your business is located, and the types of services you offer. , Once you’ve weighed the pros and cons of the very rewarding and demanding landscape of being a wedding planner, you can make a decision about continuing on this career path.

, As you slowly start to establish your business, consider the professional and personal experiences you can apply to your new career path.


Do you have experience in event planning? Maybe you excel at throwing birthday and dinner parties. This is experience you can apply to being a wedding planner. If you don’t have any real experience in planning events, you’ll likely want to get some education and experience under your belt before you start planning weddings full-time.

, Although there is no formal certification required to be a wedding planner, having some practical knowledge of the business can improve your chances of success. There are many options for education as a wedding planner. You can take online courses or classes at a local college. Wedding conferences and expos may also offer some form of training that could provide you with certification.

, Having a certificate showing that you’ve completed a course in wedding planning or joined an association of professional wedding planners will help legitimize you and your business in the eyes of potential clients.


Both the American Association of Certified Wedding Planners and The Association of Bridal Consultants offer certifications. , Reading wedding industry publications like Brides magazine as well as popular books and magazines such as Martha Stewart Weddings will give you good pointers on wedding trends, successful wedding plans, and etiquette conventions.


It’s a good idea to read business publications, too. These will help you think about your own business structure and how to make it successful.

, These events will further your knowledge of wedding trends as well as successful business models.


They’ll also give you the chance to network with other wedding planners.

, Observing the weddings of family members and friends will give you ideas on what -- and what not -- to do in planning a successful wedding.


Use such occasions to network casually with potential clients and vendors. Just don't let networking diminish the occasion: you're there mainly to celebrate the newly married couple.

, Having hands-on experience with wedding planning will give you practical knowledge that you can use for your business. You’re likely to get references from colleagues and suggestions for clients as well.

, This will supplement any formal knowledge you have and give you practical experience working in the field.


Your boss can also act as a reference for you with potential clients.
Internships are often unpaid. The experience you gain will be more valuable than a paycheck.
Your boss could wind up a long-term mentor as you rise through the profession.
It might be useful to take a job with a smaller company at first. This will give you the chance to work in all aspects of wedding planning and greatly increase your knowledge.

, This will give you the valuable hands-on experience you need -- to say nothing of the chance to prospect for clients at the same time. Use these friends and family members as references.


Be sure to take photos of any event you work on for your portfolio and future marketing efforts. Use these images on your website or in brochures. , Having a list of people whom you can ask questions, draw upon for services, or who are interested in hiring you will put your business on the path to success even in its infancy.


You can meet appropriate people almost anywhere, especially at industry conferences, wedding expos, vendor shops, and, of course, at weddings.
Never stop practicing interpersonal skills as you develop your network.

, You’ll need to be a legal entity to legitimize your business. Formalizing a business structure, developing a marketing strategy, and establishing a billing structure will show potential clients that you are a serious businessperson.


If you have any questions, consult the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), which was set up to help smaller companies. , The SBA and local authorities can help you if you have any questions. Setting up your business with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is also important. , This is an important step as you develop your business. Make these plans flexible to accommodate any contingency (such as illness or a lawsuit).

, Having an experienced mentor who knows the ins and outs of the wedding and wedding-planning industries will help you grow your business.


This person can offer invaluable advice on pricing, dealing with difficult clients or vendors, and how to hire staff.

, Wedding planners often offer services beyond overseeing the details of weddings. Perhaps you would like to help plan the bride’s shower or the newly married couple’s honeymoon.


If you decide to offer additional services, you’ll need to make sure you’re aware of the latest trends in those areas. You can find this kind of information in the same trade publications mentioned above.

, Think about how much you want to charge for your services. Knowing this information in advance will make you appear more professional when you meet with potential clients.


Asking other wedding planners or inquiring what other companies charge will give you a point of reference.
Make sure your prices are commensurate with your experience and your location. Weddings in Buffalo don’t cost as much as they do in New York City.

, Once you know your price structure, you can think about how to invoice your customers and the types of payment you will accept.


Have a separate bank account for your business from the one you use for personal finances.
Have separate credit lines, too.

, Maintaining fair business practices is vital to your success.

, This will be one of many calling cards you can show potential and actual clients. It will also help vendors better meet your needs.


Having something that distinguishes you from other planners will attract clients to your business.
Take pictures of any wedding-planning activities you do, and consistently update them.
Offer different styles of weddings for the wide array of tastes and budgets people will have.

, Successful advertising will help you attract clients and build your professional network.Using print media -- brochures, a website, or ads in publications -- is one way to market yourself.
Appearing at wedding conventions is another way to market your services.
Getting involved in community activities is a type of free marketing. Donating a service or making a contribution to charity sends a message to the public you want to serve.

, In the early stages you may be the only person on staff. You simply may not be able to afford to hire anyone.


If you decide to hire help, you’ll look for someone who's professional, experienced with weddings, and can help you grow your business.

, They will grow as you gather experience. It’s important to continue making new contacts. Your success depends on it.


Consider partnering with other businesses to benefit each other.
Use several different vendors for a given service. If you run into an emergency or have a bad experience with one company, you can turn to others.

, Weddings are a very trendy business. Being aware of current trends and continuously accumulating all types of pertinent knowledge is important to your continued success.


The best ways to continue your education are the same as when you first started out: read trade publications, attend weddings, and network with other wedding planners.

, You’ve taken the steps to be a wedding planner. Remember to enjoy the chance to be part of a couple's special day.

Think of a concise, effective way to introduce yourself.,
Set specific and appropriate networking goals.,
Ask mutual acquaintances for introductions.",How to Network at Holiday Parties1," Before actually meeting strangers or people in other departments at the gathering, consider how you’ll introduce yourself and describe your profession. Choose a brief, compelling description, but try not to rattle it off and make it sound rehearsed.For example, if you are launching a startup company, avoid saying something like, “I work from home and I’m trying to get this company off the ground, but seem to have constant trouble.” The people you meet will likely interpret this as a lack of success.
Say something like, “I’m an entrepreneur and have just designed this exciting new product. It’s been a real adventure!”;
, Think of realistic goals that you can check off, like meeting three new people or introducing yourself to at least one senior officer you didn’t already know. Try not to set unreachable goals, like securing a definite promotion or getting new investors for your product or service., Think about who will be attending the party, and if you don’t already know, find out the guest list if possible. Ask a mutual acquaintance who’s either hosting the party or will be there to introduce you to someone.Say something like, “Hey, I know you invited Jim, the senior V.P. of product development, to your party tomorrow evening. Any chance you could introduce us if you have a chance? I’d love to have a chat with him about a design I’ve been working on.”

"
"
Ask others about their careers and passions.,
Try not to monopolize anyone’s time.,
Bring business cards, but don’t just thoughtlessly dispense them.",How to Network at Holiday Parties2," While you want to prepare how you describe yourself in advance, your focus should be on others. Start conversations by asking about others’ professions, what they like about their jobs, what their career ambitions are, and more.You should also ask others about their hobbies and interests. Try not to focus on shop talk alone, but do your best to cultivate a sincere interest in what makes the people you meet tick.
Try asking, ""So, tell me about what you do - what are your favorite parts of your job?"" Ask about goals, such as, ""Where do you see yourself at this time next year?"" Ask them questions on topics that aren't work-related, too: ""What do you do when you're off the clock? Any favorite hobbies? Read any good books or see any good movies lately?""

, Do your best to get a feel for when the conversation starts to run stale, or when it’s it time to mingle elsewhere. You don’t want to monopolize anyone’s time, and you certainly don’t want to waste your potential networking time.Try to notice if you both start to run out of things to say, if you or the other person starts looking around (as if looking for an excuse to leave), or if either you or the other person starts doing all the talking.
To excuse yourself, say something like, “Pardon, I just saw someone I’ve got to say hi to - we’ll touch base later, I’m sure!” Avoid excusing yourself by saying “I’m going to get another drink or plate of food.” It’s bad manners to get something for yourself without offering the same to the other person.

, You certainly want to be prepared with an ample supply of business cards. However, you should offer one just in case you actually need it. Don’t just decide on a number and hand them out trying to meet a quota.Give someone a card only after having a conversation with them. A card is useful if you've talked about reasons to touch base afterward, like they want to look over something you wrote or designed, the fact that you both have been meaning to keep in touch with people from other departments, or you have a mutual interest, like tennis or golf, that you might do together in the future.

"
"
Limit your alcohol consumption.,
Participate in the party’s theme.,
Be a hospitable guest.,
Keep a positive attitude.,
Follow up with people you meet.",How to Network at Holiday Parties3," Most holiday gatherings will serve alcohol, but you should treat any networking opportunity as work. If you choose to imbibe, limit yourself to a maximum of two drinks. Know your limits, and don’t drink if any alcohol at all will compromise your speech or judgment., Many holiday parties have themes, like ugly sweater parties or toy or canned food collections. Whatever the theme, make sure you take part, or you’ll risk looking uninformed or lazy.If there is no dress theme, make sure you’re wearing your best business casual attire, or otherwise dressed appropriately. Don’t dress festively for the sake of it: remember you should be treating this as a casual work affair.

, If it’s appropriate, bring a bottle of wine, dessert, cheese, or some other item that your host might appreciate. If the party isn’t at someone’s home, the host would be considered the most senior officer in attendance.Be sure to compliment the host on the choice of venue, decor, selection of food, or some other detail. When you leave, you should of course thank the host for their hospitality and thoughtfulness.
You should also send a handwritten thank you note to the host the next day, in addition to your verbal thank you.

, Try to go in with a positive attitude, whether you have a career goal in mind or just want to show some team spirit. Even if you’re naturally shy or hesitant, you should try to get out of your comfort zone and have fun.Even if you think you don’t need any new contacts, you should still make an effort to attend holiday parties. You truly never know what opportunities may arise.

, ""Ignore the follow up at your own peril"" is considered the number one networking commandment. If you’ve had a good conversation with someone, exchange cards and let them know you’ll be in touch. Send them a follow up email letting them know what a pleasure it was to meet them.If you met or interacted with a senior employee at your company, write them a short email so that you stand out from other people they spoke to or met.
Mention specifics from your conversations to indicate that you were indeed paying attention to them. Say something like, ""I really enjoyed our chat at the party. Your point about how social media has affected our marketing strategies more this year than in the past really stuck with me. Perhaps we could meet after the holidays to discuss the company's goals for the coming year?""

Find out where the couple is registered.,
Choose a store to visit if there is a physical location near you, and seek out the registry.,
Head to a store's website and look up the couple's registry if it is an online-only company or there isn't a physical store near you.

,
Read over either the printed-out wedding registry or the online version to see what the couple has requested.

Browse around the store until you find the gift you'd like to purchase.,
Click on the item you'd like to buy from the registry online.,
Buy the items you'd like from the wedding wish list at the store or online.,
Send the gift to the couple's home address instead of shipping it to your house and presenting it to them on the day of the wedding.

",How to Buy from a Wedding Registry," You may need to ask the bride's or groom's parents or a member of the wedding party. Some couples include this information in the wedding invitation, but it is generally considered impolite to do so. If the couple has a wedding website, they may include the registry information on the site.


Typically, a couple will register at more than 1 store. Some couples may choose to register at physical retailers or at online stores. Usually, 1 store is more expensive while the other is more moderately priced. If the couple registers at a third location, it may be something more unusual, such as a charity or honeymoon savings registry.;
,


Some retailers have kiosks that allow you to type in the name of the bride or groom to find the wedding wish list and print it out from the kiosk.
You may need to inquire at a customer service counter about the wedding registry.

,,, For example, you may want to spend no more than $50 on a gift.


Look for items on the list that match your budget. Also look on the wedding registry to make sure no one else has purchased those items. Usually, the wish list will note how many of an item the couple wants and how many they've received from other guests so far.

,


If you are having difficulty finding the gift on the shelves, ask a store employee to help you. The store may be out of the item, and you may need to order it.

, The website should direct you to the information page for that item, where you can place it in your cart.

,


When you buy items at a physical store, be sure to present the printed registry to the cashier so that he or she can scan it and your purchase will be noted on the registry. This can prevent duplicate gifts.
If you're ordering the item online, it should automatically note that it is from the registry. Be sure to click on the item through the registry and not search for it separately.
Some registries allow you to reserve an item so that no one else will purchase it, even if you are buying it from another location or plan to come back and order it later.

Focus on being thankful.,
Allow yourself time to feel sad.,
Remember your strengths in times of grief.,
Pamper yourself around the holidays.,
Avoid relying on alcohol, drugs, or other medications to cope.",How to Navigate the Holidays After Losing Loved Ones," When you're feeling sad, stressed, or lonely, it's important to have friends and family to help you feel better. While not all people you interact with at home, work, or in your daily life may be a good source of support, make sure to spend more time with those who have been loving, supportive, and reassuring for you.Consider reaching out to others who have lost loved ones. Ask them to hang out, go to lunch, or have dinner together.
Don't feel obligated to go to large social or family gatherings that may feel upsetting or unsupportive of your needs. Focus more on time with those who make you feel loved. However, keep in mind that it is important to avoid isolating yourself. While it is okay to decline an invitation to a party if you are really not feeling up to it, try to engage with other people as much as possible. Grief can make you more susceptible to isolative behaviors, which may have a negative effect on your mental health.
Consider calling a friend or relative who you haven't seen in a while, or who lives out of town. Reconnect with them, and strengthen your support system.;
, Talk with others about what you're feeling. Open up to others about your concerns, your worries, and your sadness. While you may not want to open up to everyone, find some trusted friends or family who make you feel loved and safe.Have a willingness to be emotionally vulnerable with those you feel closest to. It can be cathartic to open up to others. Try sharing photos of you with your loved one and tell the stories about what was happening when the photos were taken.
Find those who make you feel safe and supported when you talk about grief and loss.
For example, consider saying something like, ""It's been a tough time for me this holiday. I keep remembering that I won't be sharing it with my sister anymore.""

, Feeling connected to the people in your community may help you feel less sad, lonely, or isolated during the holidays. Reach out to people that you may not normally see or talk with, and connect with them. Consider finding places that are particularly attuned to supporting people through grief and loss. Consider these people and places:


An older neighbor, possibly one who is isolated or has limited family support. They may have experienced similar losses in their life.
A place of worship such as a church. Many churches support those who are going through difficult times. They may even have support groups for grief and loss available. Check with your local Hospice organization to find out if they have grief and bereavement support groups.
Community centers and non-profits. They may need volunteers. They may also have special holiday programs that help those feeling stressed. You might consider volunteering or donating to one of these programs. If you are donating, then you could put the gift in your loved one’s name.

, Be open to letting others know what you need. Don't feel obligated to take on every task yourself. Be willing to delegate chores and activities that need to be done around the holidays.Don't be shy about asking for what you need from others. Never feel like a burden. Many people want to help but often feel like they don't know how.
For example, consider saying, ""Could you bring or make a dish for the Christmas dinner this year? That would really help.""
Delegate chores that are appropriate for different age groups and personalities. For example, see if your younger, stronger relatives can help with yard work, while your friends that love to cook can make an extra few dishes for a small dinner gathering.

, Honoring your loved ones around the holidays can be important for you to find peace. Consider ways to make the loss feel less internal. Use these ways to externalize the loss and remember your loved ones:Create a small shrine to your loved one around the holidays. Include a picture of them, a candle, and perhaps some of their favorite flowers or candies. This can help to keep them in your mind and serve as a place where you can pray or just talk to them when you feel like it.
Share stories with relatives and friends about them. Focus on funny and uplifting stories that help you remember them in a positive way.

, If past traditions are simply a heartbreaking reminder of loved ones that have passed, know that you can create new traditions. Consider tweaking or starting new traditions that help you focus on the present. You can still find ways to integrate your loved ones into the gathering, but in a different way.For example, let's say that it's been a tradition to have your father carve a turkey at Thanksgiving or Christmas. You may feel like no one can do as good a job as he could. Consider possibly having another relative take the place, but offer a prayer or remembrance in your father's honor before the carving.
See traditions as constantly evolving rather than static. Get the younger generations of your family involved so that they can help keep traditions alive, even if they are altered over time.
Try spending some of your time around the holidays creating a family scrapbook with pictures of your loved ones as well as other members of your family who are still living.
Prepare one or more of your loved one’s favorite holiday dishes and serve it to some friends and/or family.
Visit your loved one’s burial site and leave a special holiday wreath. You could also write a special letter to them and read it at the burial site.

, Remember that there is always something to be thankful for, even if it's the smallest of things. Being thankful can be about remembering your loved ones, past and present. But it can also be about knowing that there can be positive things even in most difficult of times.Share memories of caring and giving that your loved ones have done. Think about the your current loved ones who are devoting themselves to being kind, generous, and loving.
Think about the small moments of gratitude. For example, let's say a loved one sends a holiday card to you during the holidays with a thoughtful note or pictures. Cherish this gesture.

, Be gentle and kind to yourself. If you feel like you need to cry, take time to go ahead and cry. Avoid bottling up your feelings and pretending they don't exist. You will breathe easier and sleep better when you acknowledge your sadness.Don't overwork yourself if you're feeling sad. Focus your energy on finding peace rather than more stress related to your loss.
Know it's okay to have a bad day or even a few bad days. But when it's lingering for more than two weeks, and you continue to feel very depressed, seek professional advice. A healthcare provider or counselor may be able to help you feel less depressed or grief-stricken.

, Think about ways that you have overcome past grief, loss, or challenges in life. Maybe there are strategies that have worked well, and others not so much. Focus on the ones that have been healthy and helpful for you.Write down three strengths in yourself. Write a little about each one and an example of how you used this strength in the past.
Consider saying words of self-affirmation that help to remind you of the good things in you. For example, say to yourself, ""I am blessed for all the things I have and all the things I am able to do"" or ""I am hopeful. I am strong. I am resilient."", While you may feel overwhelmed around the holidays, it's important to take time to treat yourself with love and care. Make sure to set aside time that's just for you, and helps to make you feel special. While some activities could involve your friends or family, most of the ones listed below are just about taking care of you.Get a massage. Or a manicure and pedicure.
Take a hot bath or shower.
Go shopping for some new clothes or items that make you feel special.
Try some new things and explore new places. Go to a local bakery and try some new, delicious treats. Visit a local museum or art gallery that you've never been to before.

, These substances may seem helpful at first, but can often make you feel down or possibly more depressed. Avoid mixing medications and alcohol together. If you feel like you rely on alcohol or other substances to cope with your feelings, seek help and professional advice.If you would like assistance with substance abuse treatment options or programs in your area, contact SAMHSA's National Helpline: 1-800-662-HELP (4357) or http://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline

Have a game plan for eating each day.,
Don't skip meals before a holiday party.,
Focus on mindful eating.,
Don't deprive yourself completely.,
Focus on your successes.",How to Manage the Holidays when Recovering from Binge Eating Disorder1," Continue with your usual routine for meals throughout the day. If you have been coordinating with a doctor or nutritionist about meal planning, review your meal schedule and plan each day around the holidays. Remind yourself of your recovery goals.Have a clear picture of what your day is going to look like food-wise. If there is a family gathering or holiday party coming up, consider changing the timing of when you eat, but don't deprive yourself.
Know your trigger foods. If you think you may have more difficulty around friends and family during the holidays, talk with them about your dietary plan. Most people wish to be accommodating.
Review a journal or meal plan routinely to help keep you accountable towards your recovery goals.
Try not to focus on restricting yourself because this can start a cycle of guilt and bingeing. Instead, focus on adding in healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.;
, While you may feel the desire to restrict your food intake before heading off to holiday feast, think twice about this. You are more likely to feel hungry when you have an empty stomach. And thus you're more tempted to overindulge when presented with lots of enticing food.Eat your regular meals such as breakfast or lunch, rather than skipping one or both of them before a holiday dinner.
Have a small snack that helps to reduce your cravings or hunger before heading out for a holiday party. Choose protein-rich, healthy snacks such as a bag of almonds, low fat cheese, or yogurt. Choosing fruit and veggie slices can also be a healthy way to snack.

, When you are mindful in your eating, you slow down and savor your food. This allows you to really appreciate and think about each food that enters your body. This can be particularly helpful for those with disordered eating and around the holidays when overindulgence is more common.Consider practicing mindful eating exercises at home, so that you can feel more in the rhythm of practicing this when at parties or social dinners.
One example of this exercise is to slowly eat an orange. Once you have peeled the orange, break up the orange into slices. Remove yourself from other distractions such as people, electronic devices, and other things that cause you to lose focus. Put one orange slice at a time in your mouth. With each slice, close your eyes, focus on the taste and texture of the orange. Through this slow process of eating, you can feel more connected to your food.

, While you may feel the desire to restrict yourself from sweet treats and holiday goodies completely, understand that this deprivation may make you more likely to binge. Consider allowing yourself to eat a few foods that are presented at holiday parties and large gatherings. Talk with your doctor or nutritionist about how to have a few treats while still staying on track.
While certain trigger foods may not be the best option, have some goodies that can still provide you with some satisfaction.
Forgive yourself right away if you eat something you feel you should not have eaten. Try to relax and focus on enjoying the holidays.

, Even the smallest success is a cause for celebration. For example, if you successfully get through a holiday meal without bingeing, then be proud of yourself and celebrate this success. Take a moment to give yourself a hug or a pat on the back.


Be sure to avoid measuring your success by a number on the scale or a clothing size. Remember that you are much more than a number, so try not to focus on these things.

Make having a great time your top priority.,
Step away from temptations.,
Avoid watching what others eat.,
Navigate a big holiday meal with grace.,
Consider hosting your own party.",How to Manage the Holidays when Recovering from Binge Eating Disorder2," While it is important to do what you can to prevent a binge, make sure that you do not allow these measures to ruin holiday celebrations for you. Make sure that having fun at holiday parties is your top priority since this is a once per year activity.


Try to focus on all of the non-food aspects of the party that you can enjoy, such as conversations with friends, listening to holiday music, and looking at all of the beautiful decorations.

, When you're at a party or holiday gathering, distance yourself from the food tables. While you may not be able to completely avoid such temptations, there are ways to minimize them. Choose areas of the home, office, or party location where the food is less in eyesight.Sit or stand far away from the food area.
Surround yourself with friends or family to help distract you both physically and mentally from the food.
Be willing to say ""no"" when offered something that you'd like to avoid. It's important to communicate your needs in a honest and polite way.

, Don't focus on comparing what you eat to what others are eating. This may be a trigger for you. While social gatherings may make you anxious about how you may come off to others, remember to focus on your goals for recovery. You are the best judge of what's right for you in this process of recovery.Focus your attention on other things that may catch your eye, such as the holiday decorations, pictures on the wall, or other mementos.
Remember that we are often our own biggest critics. Focus on getting to know the other people at the party, rather than feeling judged and isolating yourself.

, Holidays are often centered around food and eating. When you're at a large family meal, you may feel judged or excluded due to your condition. Be willing to handle questions about why you're eating -- or not eating -- certain things. Most people are not judgmental but just want to understand.


Consider talking with the host before the meal is served, so that there is an understanding of what you may or may not eat. Be clear that it is not due to their cooking, but rather due to your health.
Have a response ready for those who may be curious about your behavior at the event. For example, ""I am currently on a plan to help me have a better diet and healthier eating habits. It's very beneficial for me to stay happy and healthy."" However, keep in mind that you don’t have to respond in detail, especially if the person is not someone who you know well. You can simply say something like, ""It's a food item I like to eat and that is why I chose it.""

, When you're hosting your own party, you're more in control of what is served, and the food options available. You can create a party with healthy and festive treats that appeal to your meal and dietary planning. And when you're heading to other people's parties, consider bringing a healthy dish you know you can enjoy.Keep portion sizes for your party goodies smaller. You'll be less tempted to overeat when are smaller portions.
Choose healthy options such as fresh fruit, vegetables, whole grain crackers, cheese slices, and lean meats. By decorating your plates in a more festive and appealing way, even the simplest of snacks can be more appetizing.

Have a ""safe"" friend when you're feeling anxious.,
Remember the positive, non-food aspects of the holidays.,
Connect with support groups and counseling.,
Find ways to de-stress and relax.",How to Manage the Holidays when Recovering from Binge Eating Disorder3," Even if some of your family or friends may not get what you're going through, it's important to have someone that you can trust who is fully supportive of your recovery. Safe friends, whether a relative or friend, won't make you feel judged. Identify someone you can call or talk with when you're feeling anxious and wanting to binge.Consider checking in with your safe friend before and after anxiety-provoking events where food is plentiful.
Discuss with them your concerns and your triggers. With their help, you can find strength and reassurance.
As an alternative, you can also reach out to the National Eating Disorders Association's Live Helpline, which is available Monday through Friday: 800-931-2237 or http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/information-referral-helpline


, The holidays may be filled with food, but they are also filled with activities that remind us to love and cherish our friends and loved ones. Focus on doing activities that help you enjoy the holiday spirit without feeling bogged down by food. Consider doing activities like these with friends or family:


Decorate a Christmas tree. Make ornaments and other crafts that are holiday-themed.
Go holiday shopping.
Do some winter sports and activities. Go ice skating, sledding, or skiing.
If you're a sports fan, watch some football or basketball games with the family.
If you're a movie lover, gather friends and family together for a holiday-themed movie night.

, While the holidays may feel overwhelming with social obligations and holiday expectations, it's important to stay focused on your wellness and recovery. Make sure to keep the appointments you have with your treatment team such as a counselor. If you aren't already connected to counseling or support groups, consider starting around the holidays.Counselors are trained to help with stressful events and triggers. Consider identifying providers available through your health insurance network that are therapists trained in treating eating disorders.
Find treatment providers for binge eating through the Binge Eating Disorder Association website: http://bedaonline.com/binge-eating-disorder-treatment/

Identify support groups for disordered eating in your community by getting referrals through counseling centers or by reaching out to Overeaters Anonymous: https://oa.org/ or Eating Disorders Anonymous (EDA): http://www.eatingdisordersanonymous.org/

If you are already in treatment, make sure to schedule and keep your appointments over the holidays. This can help you to cope with the stress you may be experiencing.

, Focus on relieving stress in ways that don't involve food. Give a little extra time just to treat and pamper yourself. Do things that make you feel better in mind, body, and spirit. This is particularly important when people are highly stressed over the holidays.Do yoga. Stretch your body and clear your mind.
Try meditation. This helps to clear your thoughts.
Deep breathing or visualization exercises. This can help to reduce anxiety in the moment, and help you cope when triggers occur.
Take a hot shower or bath. The warm water can release muscle tension.
Get a massage. This can help relieve stress and relax your muscles.

Give yourself plenty of time.,
Set your budget.,
Focus on styles you know work for you.,
Explore additional styles.,
Research your local shops.,
Buy your dress online.,
Look at consignment stores.,
Consider vintage and other nontraditional dresses.,
Have a dress custom made.,
Look at rental options.,

Choose who will go with you.,

Be open to new ideas.,
Don't let minor details on the dress hold you back.",How to Buy a Wedding Dress," To avoid feeling rushed, start the shopping process as early as possible. Most experts recommend starting about eight months before the wedding day. Dresses usually take three to six months to arrive after they're ordered. You will then need additional time to have the dress fitted and adjusted.;
, The cost of wedding dresses can vary immensely. Get an idea of your budget and set two price levels: one for your desired price and one for your absolute maximum. This gives you a goal to shoot for, while providing some leeway if you fall in love with a more expensive dress.Keep the cost of alterations in mind. The assistants in the bridal boutique can usually help you estimate how much your desired adjustments will cost.
Accessories and shoes should also be factored into your budget. You can often borrow jewelry and hair accessories, but it’s a good idea to cushion your budget just in case you need to buy these items yourself.

, Use this knowledge to narrow your search for the perfect dress. The best style wedding dress will often be the type of dress you know flatters your figure., There are thousands of wedding dress styles, so try to narrow your search before you head out to the store. Buy some bridal magazines, explore Pinterest and wedding blogs, try searching for images you like online. Consider making a scrapbook or Pinterest board of everything that appeals to you.

, Find out where all your local dress shops are, and research their styles, price range and quality. Read reviews and compare them, taking in what others say about their dresses and service.


Bridal salons are usually the most expensive option, but they provide personal bridal consultants who can help you find the right dress. In addition, you can try on dresses to see how they look on you, not just in a picture. Salons usually have seamstresses on site to do any alterations you need.

, There are several good wedding dress outlets online, such as Best Bridal Prices, PreOwned Wedding Dresses and Once Wed, as well as resale options, such as eBay and Craigslist. These sources allow you to purchase a new or almost-new dress at a steep discount to a full-service local shop.Make sure you have accurate measurements. Because wedding gown sizing can vary significantly, you'll want to compare your actual measurements to those listed for the dress.
It can take just as long to receive a dress from an online site as it does from a brick-and-mortar boutique, so don't wait for the last minute.
Check return policies before purchasing. All sales are final at many online wedding outlets, but some might allow you to return unworn and unaltered dresses within a certain number of days. Those being sold on eBay or Craigslist are rarely returnable.Use secure payment options. Unfortunately, the internet is full of scam sites. You need to be careful.

, A good compromise between a full-service shop and an online outlet is a local consignment shop. Inventory changes often, so ask the shop owner to let you know when new dresses come in.

, A wedding dress doesn’t need to come from a wedding shop, and it doesn’t need to look like a traditional wedding dress. Many vintage shops, boutiques and even department stores carry dresses that can easily be used for a wedding, yet are as unique as you are and don’t carry a wedding shop price tag., The price of a custom-made dress can be surprisingly reasonable. Check online to find seamstresses who specialize in wedding dresses, then check out their reviews. They will have patterns you can choose from, or you can bring a picture of a dress for them to replicate.Be sure to get a firm price quote. You don’t want to be surprised by the cost when it comes time to pay the bill. You can often keep the cost down by supplying your own material from a fabric outlet store.

, Rental wedding apparel isn’t just for the groom any more. You can find several rental options online. Rent the Runway and Borrowing Magnolia are two of the more popular sites. These services don’t allow alterations, so this option works best if off-the-rack dresses usually fit you well.Some traditional wedding dress shops are beginning to take advantage of the rental trend. Ask around at your local stores to see if any are offering this service.

, Do you have a friend who got married in a dress you love? Ask if you can borrow it. You’d be surprised how often friends are happy to loan their dress and see it get some additional wear.


If you and your best friend are the same size and have the same taste, consider sharing the costs of the perfect wedding dress. You can both end up wearing a better dress than you could afford on your own.

, Be sure to make an appointment. Arrive on time and respect the appointment time., Ask the bridal salon if there is a limit to how many helpers you can bring. At a minimum, brides usually bring their mom or their maid of honor.


Choose who you take with you wisely. You want to make sure you value their opinion and know they are looking out for you. Try not to bring too many friends. You don’t want so many opinions that it is impossible to make a decision., Shopping online doesn’t mean you have to give up the traditional “dress shopping party.” Have your bridesmaids come over for the afternoon to look at the choices you’ve bookmarked online. Provide champagne and snacks.


If you are ordering from an online outlet that allows returns, you can order several dresses and have your mom and bridesmaids help you choose which one to keep.
Take your friends to custom dress fittings. If you have decided to have your dress custom made, you can include your friends by bringing them to the fittings.
Don’t get hung up on sizes. Wedding dresses often run differently than your everyday dress. Buy a dress that fits you now, even if you think you will lose weight. You can always alter a dress to fit if you go down a size or two by your wedding day., Talk to store assistants about what you want in the dress and your budget, and let them make suggestions. You might end up pleasantly surprised by what they bring out!


Don't commit too early; shop around. A lot of stores offer a discount if you buy that day. Unless you really love the dress and do not want to look at anything else, don't fall for the pressure.

, There is a lot of room to play with designs once you've ordered your dress. Most seamstresses are able to make adjustments, such as adding straps, removing straps, shortening the dress and making other alterations to make the dress perfect.


As you try on each dress, ask the assistant's input on what can and can't be done with the dress design. Many of them have the experience to tell you what can be adjusted and what can't.
If the sample dress — the dress you try on when looking for “the one” — fits you well, ask if you can buy that specific dress at a discount. Bridal salons will sell their sample dresses at significant discounts at the end of each season, but are often willing to sell one on the spot if you ask. Be sure to check for wear and tear, such as loose buttons or frayed hems."

Determine your budget.,
Determine the average age of your guests.,
Determine the size.,
See if there are any local bands that fit your criteria.,
Think about how long do you want the band to perform.,
Decide if you would like a live first dance.,
Determine if your venue accept the band.,
Using your answers, shortlist 3 or so bands based on the criteria and most importantly, the demos and videos.,
Once you have confidence in a band, contact them stating your requirements as mentioned in our checklist above.,
As the prices come back, compare them with your set budget (if you have one) and if they are close but over, ask the band if they can better their offer.,
Once you have found your perfect band, book them as quickly as possible.,
Always work to a contract, and if you don’t receive one, request one.",How to Book a Wedding Band," If you have a strict budget, make a note of your absolute maximum. The price will vary depending on the number of musicians, travel costs, accommodation, and quality/schedule of your chosen bands.;
, Unless you are either very young, or very old, it is quite likely that your guests will have a pretty broad age-range. Buy all means target bands that play your preferred style, but be sure that they have some older tracks in their play-list to keep granny happy. If you are keen to avoid the typical wedding cheese (as so many are these days), then be aware of this through the bands play-list. Are you looking for a cool modern band, or a cheesy sing-along band? Female or Male vocals? Or both?

, How many musicians do you want? With so many variations in line-up (anything from solo performers to big bands with brass sections and all), it is important to know how many musicians you want. Usually, a 6-8 piece band can recreate all of your favorites to a standard that isn’t too far from the original. If you are more leaned towards pop then it might be worth considering a 6-piece to include at least one male and one female lead vocalists, then 4 piece rhythm section which is standard as guitar, bass, keyboards,and drums.

, As mentioned before, local bands means less travel expenses, plus local bands like to play close to their homes, so you may end up with a better quote to start with. Google search the term wedding band ""your local area"" and see what you find. You might get lucky!

, The standard is a 4 hour block - so 4 sets and 3 breaks. Most bands will fill the gaps with mp3 music through the PA system. If you require a band to play longer, be sure to check that their set-list has enough songs that you like to cover the extra time. As a guide, 1 hour of live music is usually roughly 14 or 15 songs.

, If so, you may have to factor in an extra 50 dollars for the band to learn it. Most bands will do it for free if it is just the one song, so are you willing to pay or are you looking for a free first dance request. Lots of bands have very good choices of 1st dance songs on their repertoires, ready to play at your request.

, Many venues are licensed for 4 or less musicians. Be sure to check license limits and sound/noise limits with the venue in advance of contacting any bands. Also, check that parking is available and there are no loading or unloading issues or time limits (e.g. Gates lock at 1am). Ask if your venue needs the band's PLI (public liability certificate) or PAT (portable appliance test certificates) and if so, make them a compulsory check point on your criteria list.

, Be sure to have roughly 50% as a deposit available. The absolute best way to hear the quality of a band (aside of going to see them) is to watch a live video clip of a show. Preferably shot by a fan (shaky hands an’ all). Remember, it's not the video quality you're looking out for, it’s the versions of the songs. Listen for likeness to the originals and watch for audience reaction. Anyone can sit in a studio for 5 days re-doing a part until it sounds ok. The live videos are pure honesty.

, You should start by checking their availability. Good bands get booked quite far in advance. You should start looking roughly 12-18 months before your event if you want the best bands.

, Depending on the season, they may just bring it down for you.

, The band booking game is ruthless, and a band can only be in one place at one time. Ask them to secure the date and send you a contract asap. Once you have read and checked the contract, scan it off and pay the deposit. That way, you can be sure that you have booked your perfect band.

, All good bands work off of contracts. Double check the contract for food riders (it is normal to feed the band) and performance times. Read through the cancellation terms and be sure you are happy with them.

Talk to retailers and other photographers to see what they recommend.You’ll need a tripod and a monopod, camera bags, lenses, 4 GB memory cards, a flash, and a camera.
Rent your gear before you purchase. This will give you a trial period to see if it works for you.;
, You need to know your photography equipment in and out. That way, you’ll be able to focus on getting the perfect shot when the wedding day arrives. Go through your camera’s owner’s manual, take photos in tons of different conditions, and consider taking a photography class or workshop.Make sure you know how to handle your equipment in different lighting conditions and when the subject is moving quickly., While taking classes isn’t necessary to becoming a wedding photographer, it can definitely help. Consider taking classes at your university, local community college, or online.Photography classes can help you get a feel for technique and equipment fundamentals. If you are in college, consider majoring or minoring in photography.

, Every photographer has their own style. This style isn’t fixed. Rather, it’s constantly evolving as the photographer grows. To develop your own style, look to your favorite photographers for inspiration. See what elements you like, and try to bring them to life in your own work.

There are two kinds of wedding photography: traditional, which involves classic, posed photos, and photojournalistic, which involves more candid photos. Your own style might lean towards one, or blend the two., In order to grow creatively and develop your own photography style, you’ll need to take risks. Try different angles and color schemes, and test different techniques. Just remember that the wedding is not the place for radical experimentation.While you can--and should--experiment with some shots at the wedding, avoid turning the entire shoot into a creative experiment.

, Wedding photographers often spend more time editing their photos than they do actually taking them. It’s a good idea to become proficient in photo editing softwares like Photoshop and Lightroom by watching online tutorials or attending workshops, and practicing on your own, of course.Consider your personal photography style when editing your photos. Your finished photos should reflect your style.

, One of the best ways to learn is to watch others who have mastered the craft. Ask local wedding photographers you admire if you can shadow them during a photoshoot or work as an assistant. Pay close attention and take notes if you need to.Working as an assistant to an established wedding photographer is a great way to get into the industry.

, Having a portfolio of your work is key for any aspiring wedding photographer. A website is a great place to house your portfolio. On your website, clients can learn more about your business while browsing through your work.Your online portfolio is a digital representation of your business, so make sure it looks professional. Your website should have a consistent style and easy-to-navigate format.
One way to build your portfolio is to offer to work for free. You can help out a professional wedding photographer, or offer to shoot a friend's wedding free of charge. You’ll gain valuable experience while getting shots for your portfolio., Joining a photography organization is a great way to connect with other wedding photographers and learn more about your art. These organizations also offer great networking opportunities. Your new photographer friends can give you referrals!Organizations like Wedding and Portrait Photographers International (WPPI) offer strategies, tips, and equipment reviews for professional wedding photographers.
Try to find a photography group in your area. If you can’t find one, consider starting your own.

, Talk to you clients via phone or video chat before they hire you to make sure both parties know what to expect stylistically. Tell them about your style principles, and encourage them to look through your portfolio again.Maybe your clients want a more formal style, and yours is more candid. You can either refer the clients to a different photographer, or adjust your own style a bit for the shoot. However, don’t compromise too much--it’s important that you have a coherent style as a wedding photographer.

, The wedding day is brimming with photo opportunities, and you can’t seize them all. To ensure you don’t miss any must-have photos, sit down with the couple before the shoot to discuss the photos they want the most.Maybe the bride really wants a photo with her best friend, or one of her mother adjusting her veil. Talk about these essential photos beforehand so you can plan ahead.

, You should definitely give the clients access to the digital files of the photos, but you may want to include some prints as well. Discuss what is expected in your initial meeting with your clients.You should also establish a time frame for delivery. Should the couple expect the photos in 2 weeks, or 2 months?

, Visiting the venue prior to the wedding will allow you to get your bearings. Take some test shots to see how the lighting looks, and look for any especially picturesque spots.You should also attend the rehearsal dinner, if possible. This will help prepare you for the big day, and gives you another opportunity to get some great shots.

, Sometimes, you’ll need to move things along to make sure the wedding stays on schedule. If the family wants to take endless photos before the reception, but there simply isn’t enough time, it’s alright to kindly tell them so.Say something like, “We’ve already taken a lot of photos, and I think they turned out well, but now it’s time for the couple to head to the reception.”

, Known as “Uncle Bobs” in the industry, these are guests who threaten to ruin wedding photos by standing in the way, often holding Ipads or cameras of their own. If such a guest is in the way of one of your shots, politely ask them to move.Try saying something like, “Can you please move a bit to the side? I can’t see the bride, and I want these photos to turn out well for the couple. Thank you!”

, You’ll get the best photos when people feel relaxed around you. Be friendly and warm. Strike up conversations with the wedding guests. You’ll be rewarded with more natural-looking photos., While your photos should focus on the people at the wedding, don’t forget to photograph the little details, like a champagne glass on a table, or the wedding cake. While they may be small, these details can make a huge difference., Always back up your photos on another disc drive. This will ensure you don’t lose all of your hard work, and will give you peace of mind., Bring extra cameras and lenses on your trip. If anything goes wrong with your primary camera on the wedding day, you’ll need to be prepared., The job of a wedding photographer can be pretty physically demanding. You might be carrying up to twelve pounds of photography gear for eight to ten hours on the wedding day. Wear comfortable shoes on the job, and see a doctor for any aches and pains.You might need to hire a helper to carry some of your gear.

, As a wedding photographer, you’ll essentially be running your own business, so an understanding of business is key. Business classes, or even a business degree, can give you a better feel for the business side of the industry.Try taking business classes at your university, online, or at your community college. If you can’t take classes, try to read some books about business.

, If you are a novice or wedding photography is a hobby, you probably shouldn’t charge very much. However, once you have established yourself professionally, you should price your work according to the market. Avoid severely under-pricing in an effort to beat out competition, or as a favor to friends. Your business won’t be sustainable if you do.Calculate your profits by subtracting your expenses from your revenue to see how much you’re really earning. An accountant can help you keep your finances in order.

, Getting a business license can enhance the credibility of your wedding photography business, and depending on where you live, it may be required., A contract is a legally binding document that will protect you and your clients in case something goes wrong. If you are photographing weddings professionally, it’s important that you never take a job without a contract., Once you have established your professional wedding photography business, it’s a good idea to get insurance. Liability insurance protects you if, for some reason, you are unable to complete your normal duties, while malpractice insurance protects you in case of accidental injury or damage to your gear.Some professional photography organizations cover insurance.

Make a list of possible choices.,
Avoid the obligation trap.,
Break with gender stereotypes.,
Ask friends you can trust.,
Ask people who support your marriage.,
Refrain from being upset if someone says no.",How to Ask Someone to Be Your Bridesmaid1," Before you go and ask the first people who pop into your head, take your time to think about who you want to ask. Talk to your fiance about your choices. Think about where the wedding will be held and if everyone can attend, especially if it’s a destination wedding. Then, make a list of people you would like to ask. Figure out if each person will fit well into your wedding.Talk to your fiance about how many people will be in their wedding party. Then decide if you want the number to match.;
, Some people feel obligated to ask certain people for many reasons when they get married. This can cause stress for the bride, groom, and wedding party. Don’t feel like you have to ask anyone. It is your wedding, after all.For example, you don’t have to ask someone whose wedding you were in years ago. You don’t have to ask people’s siblings or old college roommates. Ask people you truly want to be your bridesmaid.

, Just because you are a bride doesn’t mean your bridal party has to be all women. If you are closer to the men in your life, have bridesmen instead of bridesmaids. This is your wedding, so you want to make your bridal party how you want it.For example, if you want your brother in your bridal party, or your best friend is a man, ask them.
Don’t worry about matching the same number of men and women in the bridal and groom parties. Have the people you truly care about with you at the alter regardless of whether anything follows traditional rules.

, Being a bridesmaid is a big responsibility, and they will need to be there for you when things get stressful. Choose friends who have stuck by you for a long time, who have always been loyal, or who you know you can trust.Be wary with newer friends, especially if you haven’t been friends for very long. You may not know if you can trust them yet.

, Though you may be close with someone, if they don’t like your fiance or support your marriage, don’t ask them to be in your bridal party. Instead, ask friends who will support you and be happy for you on your big day., Some people may not have the time or money to be a bridesmaid, or they may not want that much attention. Whatever the reason, don’t get upset if someone declines to be in your wedding.If someone declines, you can say, ""I completely understand. Thank you for letting me know! I hope you will still come to the wedding!""

Create a crafty way to ask.,
Send them a beautiful card.,
Create a scrapbook.,
Make them picture frames.,
Buy them jewelry.",How to Ask Someone to Be Your Bridesmaid2," There are many ways to ask someone to be your bridesmaid. If you are good at making crafts, or just want to create a special, unique way to ask your bridesmaids, try creating an artistic proposal.For example, you can place your question or phrase in a fortune cookie. Decorate the fortune cookie with white chocolate and metallic sprinkles.
Take bottles of wine, champagne, or sparkling cider and attach labels asking if they would be your bridesmaid. You may also place labels on candles in the colors of your wedding or in scents that remind you of the bridesmaid.

, You may want to surprise your future bridesmaids with a card in their mailbox or sent to their work. The outside of the card can ask the question, while the inside can contain a personalized note from you.You can choose to make your own cards from cardstock. You can print designs from a computer program, or you can decorate the card by hand with ribbon, glitter, flower petals, or other decorations.
Some companies sell cards specifically geared towards asking someone to be your bridesmaid.

, Put together a scrapbook of photos featuring fun times you have had with your potential bridesmaids during your friendship. If you don’t want to do a whole scrapbook, just do a photo album. On the last page, you can ask the question.If you have mementos, you can add copies to each scrapbook. This might include movie or concert tickets, receipts, or notes.

, Go to a craft store and buy frames for each bridesmaid. Decorate the frame with their name. You can also draw something on the frame if you are artistic, paint something using a stencil, or add decorative accents. Along the top, write “BRIDESMAID.”Don’t forget to add the picture on the inside.

, Jewelry is never a bad way to ask someone to be your bridesmaid. You can buy them rings, bracelets, or necklaces that feature bows since you are tying the knot. If you already know the theme for your wedding, you can choose jewelry in the design of your wedding theme.Many online sellers sell bridesmaid-themed jewelry on sites like Etsy.

Organize a special day.,
Treat everyone to a meal.,
Have a coffee, tea, or ice cream party.,
Decorate cookies or cupcakes.,
Ask them individually.",How to Ask Someone to Be Your Bridesmaid3," Instead of giving your potential bridesmaids a material gift, take them some place nice and ask them there. You can plan a special themed surprise or gift, or just use the opportunity of having everyone together to ask.For example, you could go for a spa day and treat everyone to a special gift, like a pedicure, and ask them then. You might give them all matching robes that say “bridesmaid” on them.

, Invite all your bridesmaids to get together for brunch, lunch, or dinner, your treat. While everyone is together, you can ask them to be your bridesmaid.Consider place cards that say “bridesmaid” on them that you can sit at each person’s seat before you arrive.

, Invite everyone to your home for a fun party. Depending on your tastes, you can have a coffee bar, a tea party, or an ice cream sundae bar. Let everyone make their own tasty treats and eat specially made desserts before you ask them., If you like to cook, you may want to ask your potential bridesmaids with food. Throw an engagement party or just invite them over, and prepare a cookie or cupcake for each woman.You can decorate the cookies with the word “BRIDESMAID” or the question.
Consider putting flags in the cupcakes that say “BRIDESMAID” or asking the question.

, If you want to keep it simple, consider asking the lucky lady in person. You can invite them to your home, visit them, or meet for dinner or coffee. Catch up and enjoy spending time with each other before you ask.

Keep it simple by saying something like, “I have something very important to ask you. Would you like to be my bridesmaid?”

Avoid stress.,
Stay healthy.,
Stay hydrated.,
Prepare.,
Relax.,
Be ready for if you faint.",How to Avoid Fainting at Your Wedding," One of the worst things you can do to your body and mind is stress out. Get things prepared for your wedding ahead of time. Don't cross things off your list, such as making the invitations pretty, because you run out of time and you think it's not as important. Spend quality time on them, but do them enough in advance that as your walking down the aisle, all the stress you had doesn't boil over onto you and you pass out. Remember some of the basic necessities you need to get done for your wedding (plan to get them done at least a month before your wedding).


Look at some of these articles that might help you plan your wedding.

How to Plan a Wedding Rehearsal

;
, Fainting can happen even when you have the slightest cold. Be extremely careful so you don't get sick. Don't go out and get food poisoning the day before your wedding. Don't eat anything not bad for you, and stock up on vitamins so you stay bubbly and happy, and feel good. Be as safe as you can before your wedding. If you begin to feel sick or run-down, take some medicine, or nap.


Be physically healthy. To relieve stress or feel a little better, exercise, but don't exercise too much. You don't want to be feeling run down, but you do want to be in good shape and not a wreck on your wedding day.

Remember to eat healthily so you feel fresh and spirited, not slow or hungry.


Be mentally healthy. Stay very calm and do a puzzle or two to keep your mind in shape, so you don't feel as disorganized on your wedding day.

, Fainting happens the most when you are suffering of dehydration. Make sure that you drink lots of water on your wedding day to make sure that you won't faint. On the day of your wedding, keep some water with you at all times and drink it as much as you can (but make sure you go to the bathroom before you walk down the aisle!).

, On the day of your wedding, you don't want to freak out and lose consciousness. Prepare your dress, money, shoes, and everything that you will need to do in order to walk down the aisle. Get everything ready, and ask someone to help you so you don't have so much pressure on yourself. Also prepare yourself for everything you'll be going through on your wedding, including the stress, tiredness, painful smiles, hand-aching thank-you notes, etc., and take a minute to relax and take it in.

, It's easier said than done, of course, but beforehand, take a nap, drink some water, do something to take your mind off the wedding for only a moment. Just be happy and don't think about anything else but your fiancé and your happily-ever-after life together.


Spend some time with your fiancé before the wedding. He might be just as stressed out as you are.

, Be prepared, and know why you fainted. Be prepared for everything to be put off for a little while, and tell someone beforehand what to do if you faint (see tips).

Start a wedding binder.,
Do your research.,
Deal with conflict with the groom up front.,
Budget like crazy.,
Be aware that helpers are trying hard, not trying to harm.,
Practice assertive responses.,
Set aside wedding planning time and stick to it.,
Allot chill-out time for you alone and for you and the groom together.",How to Be an Assertive Bride Without Being a Bridezilla," Choose a large binder that can contain everything you'll want to refer to, including pamphlets, print-offs, notes and images. Get a bunch of plastic file holders and stick them inside for ease of keeping materials in place. Write something like ""My Wedding Planner"" on the front and keep this binder in an easily accessible place for referring to when discussing the wedding with anyone from the caterer to your cousins.


A mini spin-off of this binder can be kept on your cell phone or iPad for taking with you wherever you are. Get into the habit of scanning in the information or photographing it, then uploading the scans or images to your electronic devices. If you have time, regularly turn the binder into an electronic PDF for a complete reference source wherever you go!;
, Plan big to begin with, then trim it back to reality once you discover the costs, the challenges and the availability of the things you want. One part of turning into bridezilla is having unrealistic expectations that can't ever be met for one reason or another. As with anything in life, being realistic will ensure a smoother path and you're less likely to lose the plot when something you really wanted won't materialize.


Read wedding books and websites - visit the library or check out bookstores for wedding information and check online for wedding websites. Doing your research as to what is and isn't possible will help you to keep a realistic attitude toward the planning.

, Do you and your husband-to-be agree on everything about the wedding? If he is invested in both you and the wedding, he'll have his own ideas too. And it may just be that they don't dovetail neatly with yours. This isn't a reason to throw a fit. In fact, it's a healthy start to your long life together because you're already in a position to learn negotiation and compromise with your future spouse, as well as recognizing that his different ideas means he cares enough to engage in the wedding preparations.


Sit down together and share ideas about the wedding. What does he want? Ask him!
Look for wedding checklists in books and online. Print one off and write down what you want. Give copies for the groom to fill out, because it's his wedding, too. When both of you are finished, compare notes. If conflicts occur, find a healthy compromise. It's a good lesson for the rest of your life.

, A wedding is one day in your life, not the be all and end all. The day after it, you will face the reality of living together and if you've already decimated the savings, it will feel deflating. The wedding industry wants you to spend a lot of money––it raises expectations of what a wedding should be with every new year. Be a conscious consumer when it comes to deciding what you will spend on your wedding and don't feel that you have to have things just because the Jones had them for their wedding. Yes, this is even if you have the money on tap––save that money for the rainy days ahead.


Go for quality rather than quantity. Less is definitely more, and the few quality pieces will shine all the more for it.
A camera on every table is so yesterday. Ask guests to feel free to take their own photographs on their own digital cameras and give them a central online repository to leave photos for you after the wedding.
Gifts for each guest? Don't go overboard. Stick to simple things like bags of sugarcoated almonds or a piece of the wedding cake in a pretty bag.
Try a brunch or afternoon tea instead of a three course dinner meal.

, It can be all too easy to confuse help for harm when you feel overwhelmed by suggestions from family and friends. People genuinely want to help and they want to share what worked for them. While their ideas may be off-the-planet as far as you're concerned, realize that they are being helpful and learn to steer their enthusiasm rather than squelch it.


When your mother tries to tell you how to do things, listen politely. Try to pick up on one thing she has said that you'd be willing to do or compromise on. Then explain that you appreciate her ideas and that you'll do your best to do that one thing. It can also be ideal to assign her to a specific task (perhaps even the one she suggested); if it's involved, she might keep out of your hair for everything else!
Let every person know you appreciate their ideas and offerings. However, at the end of the day, it is your wedding and you are entitled to say politely how you will be doing things.

, Assertiveness is a learned skill and if you haven't already grasped it, now is a great time to learn on-the-go. You'll need to use this skill from family to every business you involve in your wedding, to avoid being sold things you don't want, doing things you don't want to and inviting people you don't like.


Borrow a book from the library on being assertive. Ask the librarian for a recommendation. Or buy one when you grab the wedding magazines. It's a sensible addition to your wedding research!
Be wise to wedding marketing. Assert yourself by not succumbing to all the ""must-have"" trimmings of a wedding. The possibilities are endless but your wallet––and your temper––are not. Learn to say no when the salespersons suggest an extra cake tier, an extra frill on the dress or extra space for the wedding when you have already decided the opposite.
Know the difference between sound advice and salesmanship gab. Many people can be trusted to tell you what you should know to avoid cost blowouts, poor choices of clothing/food/venue/transport, etc. Listen to your inner smarts when getting advice to be able to sort the good advice from the sales pitch.
Most of all, learn to say no to well-meaning but interfering family and friends when their suggestions are going against what you want. A positive no is one that respects the person, praises their kindness but doesn't give in to the pushiness.

, Don't let the wedding planning take over your life. If the planning grows so large that it needs to invade your breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as all the other spare time you have, then it's likely to be out of control. Get your diary and write down set times for attending to the wedding planning, allowing the rest of your life to fit in where it should. Of course, a little flexibility is required for emergencies and changes of plan, but try hard to keep the wedding planning as a part of your life, rather than all of it.


If you can afford a wedding planner, delegate as much as possible to this person. And slot meetings with this person into your diary too, rather than feeling inclined to phone the poor person at all hours with your latest surprise.

, It's important to find time to relax and chill. This is even more important the closer you get to the wedding date. As with allotting planning time, allot relaxation time in your diary too. And make room for time spent together, just relaxing and not discussing wedding plans!

Enroll at a professional photography institute or take classes as your local community college.


Don't assume that you have to attend a top photography school. Learn the basics, regardless of where you go, and practice constantly to improve your skills.;
, If you think you'd love to become a professional destination wedding photographer, travel and photograph as much as you can. This will give you valuable practice with photographing in new places. It will also help you become comfortable with traveling with your expensive photography equipment.


While you probably won't need different photography equipment to shoot destination weddings, you will need to practice traveling and storing it. Consider using durable cameras, tripods, and flashes. Travel with plenty of backup equipment.
Putting your photos on a blog will show clients that you genuinely love to travel and can work in a variety of settings.

, Work locally for a while and build up a client base. Be available to photograph any kind of event (graduations, senior photos, engagement shoots, etc). Not only will you get technical photography experience, you'll also create a network of potential clients.Avoid jumping right into destination wedding photography. You'll need lots of experience to become just a wedding photographer without the added pressure of travel as well.

, Offer to photograph weddings for friends and relatives. Tell them you'll do this at a free or reduced rate. Photographing local weddings for friends and relatives will give you a chance to practice your craft and gain experience. You'll be able to use some of the images in your professional portfolio.If you don't know anyone needing a wedding photographer, find out if any friend or relatives still have their wedding dresses and would be willing to put on a mock wedding for you to photograph.

, A second shooter is essentially another photographer hired by a professional photographer to work the same event. You might talk with other wedding photographers and ask if any of them are looking to hire a second shooter for an event. This will give you valuable experience about what goes into shooting a wedding. You may even be asked to travel for the event.If no photographers are hiring second shooters, ask if you could apprentice under any of them.

, Once you've been taken photographs for a while, you'll probably begin to develop your own style. This is important to work on since it will help you attract and connect to clients. It will also help your potential clients decide if you'd be a good fit for photographing their destination wedding.For example, you might find that you enjoy shooting artistic or creative photographs. Or you might try to tell a story using a photojournalist style. You'd be considered traditional if you take very formal, posed photographs.

, You'll need to create a portfolio of wedding photos, just like any other wedding photographer. But, you should highlight the destination wedding photos you've taken. If you've worked in many places, try to showcase your range by including pictures from all over the world or photos taken in different styles.


If you don't have many destination wedding photos, keep the portfolio minimal, but include your absolute best work.Show your portfolio to potential clients. This helps them judge if they like your style and want to work with you.

, Your website is one of the most valuable ways to attract and connect with clients. Most potential clients will do internet searches for wedding photographers who specialize in traveling to cover weddings. You should also include information about yourself so clients feel like they know you. This will develop a comfortable rapport which will make it easier to photograph their events. Your website should include:


Information about you (your experience, training, hobbies)
Packages you offer
Locations you'll travel to
Prices
A gallery of your work
Your style
Contact information (including social media accounts)

, Every time you travel somewhere to photograph a wedding, develop a local network there. Talk with wedding planners, bridal boutiques, and other wedding vendors (like resorts, wedding cake bakers, and tux providers). Have plenty of business cards to distribute and offer fliers that showcase your work.Talk with management at the location you're photographing to see if you can be listed in their brochures as a recommended or featured wedding photographer. Many couples rely on photographer recommendations when getting married away from home.

, You'll often need to travel far to cover a single wedding. Even though you may only be hired to spend one day just shooting the wedding, you'll have to schedule time to travel to and from the event. For a single day's work, you'll have to schedule several days to travel and prepare.


It may be difficult to schedule destination weddings as well as local events throughout the week. For this reason, many destination photographers only work as destination photographers.

, Try to offer a few options to clients, but try not to overwhelm them with details. Give simple options that you know clients are looking for. For example, try to offer 3 or 4 packages in a variety of price ranges. You should also only offer what you feel comfortable providing. For example, don't offer videographer service if you don't want to be filming throughout part of the ceremony.Each package option should list a price and what it includes (like a certain number of hours coverage, prints, online galleries, videographer services, or second shooters).

, Along with each package you offer, you need to decide how much to charge. Will you charge an hourly rate or per package? Since you'll be traveling, you should also decide if you'll be charging travel expenses or if you'll include that as part of your overall package fee.


You might want to consider a minimum hourly rate or package. For example, if you'll be flying to a wedding, specify that the couple must purchase 6 hours or your travel package. This ensures that you'll be covered for your time and effort.

, Talk closely with your clients to find out if there are any images that they must get. For example, many clients will want a group wedding photo. Talk with the couple to decide if they want a formal, posed shot or if they want a casual photo of the group acting natural.


It may be helpful to come up with a list of the ""must-have"" photographs. This way, your clients will get exactly what they want.

, If you'll be traveling overseas, check with the country you're flying to to learn about any work permits or visas you'll need. Ensure your passport is in order and you're prepared to fly at short notice.If you're flying, check to see if your photography equipment should be checked or stowed in the cabin. Prepare accordingly so you don't have to leave equipment or have sensitive equipment or film damaged during the flight.

, While there's a lot of flexibility with traveling to take destination wedding photos, you can do some preparation. Research the location before you travel there so you can get ideas for settings or backgrounds. Once you're there, try to take some time checking out the venues for photo opportunities.


Specifically, pay attention to angles you could shoot from, lighting, and the mood of the space. Keep these in mind when fulfilling your couple's style expectations.

Use full formal names.,

Write the street address in a straight line under the name.,
Write house and apartment numbers in numeric form.,
Write out the street names in full.,
Spell out the full city and state name.,
Place the zip code under or after the state.,
Print the return address on the back flap of the envelope.",How to Address Bridal Shower Envelopes," A shower is a personal and intimate event, and the invitations should reflect that. So write out the names and addresses on the envelopes rather than printing them from the computer.Use black or dark blue ink since other colors may be difficult for postal workers to read.;
, Discuss and compare writing among the hostesses (if there are others besides you) to determine who has the nicest handwriting. Pick someone who can write in even, neat print or cursive.


If you don’t trust your own handwriting, or that of the other hostesses, hire a calligrapher. You can provide them with the names and addresses of your guests, and they will inscribe them on the envelopes. Cost will depend on your area, and how many invitations you are mailing.

, Anyone over the age of 13 should receive their own invitation.Address a separate invitation in a separate envelope to each person you are inviting, even if two or more of them live in the same household.

, Mistakes happen, whether you misspell a name, or smudge the ink as you’re writing. Rather than crossing something out, you should start over with a fresh envelope, so make sure to have a few extras on hand.

, The last thing you want is to get a stain on the envelopes you spent so long addressing. Wipe down your desk or table with a damp cloth and then wipe it again with a dry cloth. Be sure there’s no remaining moisture on the surface before you set down your envelopes.

, For example, write “Mrs. Jane Smith” or “Dr. Jane Smith.” Use “Mrs.” for married or widowed women and “Miss” for ladies under 18 years of age. “Ms.” can be used for single and divorced women as well as women who are married but kept their maiden names.Traditionally, only women are invited to bridal showers. However, if you invite a man, write ""Mr."" before his name.
Some examples of other professional titles are “Lieutenant,” “Reverend,” or “The Honorable” (for judges).

, It used to be common to address a married woman using her husband’s name (“Mrs. John Smith”). However, it has become more common now to simply address a married woman using her given first name and married last name (“Mrs. Jane Smith”). If you prefer the traditional method, you may still use this, but your guests may view this as too old-fashioned., Write both the first and last name of the addressee, but omit the middle name. Don’t put any nicknames or shortened versions of names on the envelope. For example, even if everyone calls the bride’s aunt “Pat,” the invitation should still be addressed to “Mrs. Patricia Jones.”

, If you’re inviting any couples, this is the only exception to the “one person per invitation” rule. Both people may receive the same invitation. Nowadays, it doesn’t matter which name comes first - the man’s or the woman’s.Address married couples as “Mr. John Smith and Mrs. Jane Smith” or “Ms. Jane Smith and Mr. John Smith” if you know she prefers to go by “Ms.” You can also use “Mr. and Mrs. John Smith” if you prefer to be more traditional.
The only time when name order matters is when one person “outranks” the other, such as if one is a doctor.For example, “Doctor Jane Smith and Mr. John Smith.”

, It doesn’t have to align perfectly with the guest’s name above it. You can play around with the design and have the name and address align to the same left indent, align to the same right indent, or have each line be centered on the envelope. Just plan ahead for this since different addresses will be different lengths and require different amounts of space.

, For ease of delivery, avoid spelling out the numbers in the address. For example, write ""5 Oak Lane"" rather than ""Five Oak Lane""

, Do not abbreviate any words in the street name, including directions like “North” and “South” and words such as Street, Avenue, Boulevard, Road, etc., Do not abbreviate the state. For example, you would write ""15 East Main Street, Buffalo, New York.""

, Use the numeric form for the zip code (i.e. 40001) and determine where you’d like to put it. In the U.S. it can be placed immediately after the state or just below it., It should be centered and written in the same ink that is used on the front of the envelope. The return address should be the same on every envelope so that you can more easily keep track of all the responses.

Take the bull by the horns and explain to any offended would-be guests that you love them and you appreciate their support but not all their requests can be accommodated.Express sympathies to your offended family. Always be compassionate and apologetic. Explain that it wasn’t your intentions to offend and let anyone who feels offended know you value them not only as a person, but you also value their desire to be supportive on your special day.From the get go, you can diffuse any hopes for an invite by making comments like, “we picked such a small venue.” This will help manage expectations before any potentially uncomfortable confrontations.;
, Your mom’s dream wedding might include triple your guest list and an expensive menu. Keep your guest list down by allowing compromises loaded in your favor. For example, let your mom know you can accommodate your Great Aunt’s sister in law, but in exchange you can’t send invitations to your dentist’s entire family.Take the blame for mom. If she feels your wedding will be the talk of the century with it’s short guest list, allow her to blame it on you. For example, she can tell her friends that you’re a force to be reckoned with, and your obscene wedding plans are completely out of her control. If she’s embarrassed by your lack of guests, this will help temper it down.Keep mom feeling busy and important. If you don’t care for wedding favors, allow her to take the project on as her own. Give her near full control of the project but still express the value of the responsibility she has taken. No one wants to be given busy work.

, When it comes to weddings, friends and family may act as if their opinion is more important than yours. Always remember that this is not the case. You and your future husband are the sole decision makers for your upcoming wedding. Planning tantrums can be avoided by carefully discussing intentions at the beginning of planning.Consider using a wedding planner. A wedding planner may seem like an expensive and unnecessary addition to the budget, but they will have insider connections to venues, caterers and florists. More importantly, they can be your wedding anchor and help deal with difficult in-laws and parents. Wedding planners are professionals are diffusing tense situations in stressful times.
Give the vendors a heads up if you think your family may go behind your back. This will prevent anyone from being able to make any changes to the menu, music playlists or photo scheme., Start with what extra money you have and plan out how much you can save to help you decide what kind of wedding you want to have. Your budget is key in deciding how many guests will be at your wedding. If your budget and desired wedding don’t correspond, you can have extra saving time by setting a later date. After you make your initial budget, don’t be afraid to re-work the numbers. Budgets should be flexible between both partners.


Use a wedding worksheet to consider all things you might miss, such as transportation to and from venues, and bridal party gifts.Ask around for help. Your parents or family may want to contribute cash to help fund the wedding, so communicate your expectations before accepting. Be cautious, however, as accepting the money may be conditional for allowing them to make wedding-related decisions, such as lengthening the guest list. It’s important to discuss your wedding-wants before accepting the cash to ensure everyone is on the same page.Keep a prioritized list of what’s a must-have to you. The list will help you stay on track and build an appropriate budget. If wedding budgets are stressing you out, take a moment to remember they are in place to help keep on you on point and not regret any decisions later., Use a tier system to determine your numbers. Start by making a first tier list of must have people. The first tier should include close family members. Next, build a second tier of people you would like to invite. The second tier would include friends and close co-workers. The third and final tier is the list of individuals you should invite, but perhaps don’t need to. For example, this would include your distant cousins and family acquaintances. Use the first tier as a jumping point for your guest list and add to your list accordingly. Be cautious in keeping these lists private to avoid hurting anyone's feelings.


Pick your wedding party. They will be vital to your special date and must fit within the guest list. Don’t feel obligated to pick only from your first tier list but rather choose based on both friendship and also function. If your best friend is soft-spoken and timid, she may be better placed as a bridesmaid while your well-liked, headstrong cousin is a more functional maid of honor.If your guest list is spiraling out of control, consider not inviting to children under 12. This can be especially helpful if you want to have a stylish, black-tie event not suited for children. Not inviting children will discourage many out-of-town relatives from coming to the wedding and if you feel strongly about having the parents there, offer childcare providers to take care of all the children together.

, When choosing a ceremony and a reception location, account for travel time and inconvenience between the two.Don’t be shy about visiting locations. If you are unsure if you would like a garden, church, or hall wedding, visit all three. Visitations are free and may give you new perspective on what's possible.


Before signing the paperwork for your venues, determine if it can hold your guest list. A venue for several hundred people may not be the best location for an intimate wedding. Also, check for rules surrounding bar services, decorating and catering, to avoid any miscommunications and conflicts closer to your wedding.

, In order to avoid potential awkwardness, ensure to title the invites only to the intended guests. For example, if you’re not inviting children, title the invite “Mr & Mrs Smith.” This gives a clear indication of who is invited.


Include clear instructions on how-to RSVP. This includes what date to respond by and how. Consider sending postage-paid envelopes or setting up an e-RSVP to save time for yourself and your guests.
Stay on top of your RSVP list. Whether you ask your betrothed or a member of the bridal party to maintain the list, it’s important to know how the number of guests is looking. If you’re somehow ending up with more guests than intended, it’s better to approach the self-invited guests sooner rather than later.

, Having a stress-free wedding is all about delegating, delegating, delegating, and the wedding party is there to help, not to just look pretty. When your bridal party comes to mind, assign tasks related to interest.If you’ve got a friend that can cook up a storm, invite her to the food tasting. Perhaps you have a gal pal that can turn a streamer into a work of art, ask her to help decorate.


Up the ante by asking your fiance and the groomsmen to help. Rather than assuming they don’t want to intrude on your domain, ask them to ensure your day remains exactly that. Suggest they plan transportation for the day, assist in decorating venues, or run small errands like dry cleaning and flower pickup.Menial tasks such as closing envelopes or cutting up invitations can be easily turned into a fun party. Invite your wedding party over for some low-stress pizza, and tackle a hefty list as a group. You’ll find that with a team of helpers you’re able to whittle down an overwhelming list in no time.

, When it comes to picking food and alcohol for a wedding, you won’t regret choosing the option you like best. After you have finality on your guest list, determine what kind of food you’d like to have. Be cautious on choosing foods guests may be sensitive towards. For example, you may love raw oysters, however the rest of your family may not. Recruit a team of people for sampling foods to ensure there’s something for everyone.


Don’t forget about the budget. Catering can be one of the most expensive lines of the wedding budget. It can easily be blown out of proportion so it’s best to keep a tight lid on it.Know the rules of your municipality and venue. Many places require special permits for alcohol and you don’t want to be stuck trying to sort out a permit at the last minute. Venue’s can also have tight rules, such as requiring in-house bartenders and servers. Manage your expectations but inquiring about every activity that you're planning.

, Don’t let your wedding planning add stress to your relationship. Take time to de-stress together. This can be as simple as walking the dogs together or going to the spa.Either way, your fiancé is only your fiancé for a short period, so enjoy them while it lasts.


Allow time to indulge. With a full plate of wedding planning, work, and the rest of your life, it can be easy to let time get away from you. If you’re finding you’re too busy to fit fun into your schedule, schedule it in. Pick a day in advance and take time to do something fun together while forgetting about the wedding for the time being.

, A wedding speech is a way for you to sit back and relax while having a fun laugh, meaningful cry and hopefully memorable surprises. Don’t hesitate to ask for speeches from your guests. It’s a sure way to make the guest feel valuable.It doesn’t need to be limited to speeches, either. Before the big date, ask someone close to you to do a special dance, since a song or make a picture slideshow.


Be cautious not to put pressure on the guests. While some guests may feel comfortable with public speaking, some may not. A forced speech is a failed speech and will surely end up with uncomfortable moments for you, your bride/groom and your guests.

, When the day is here, breathe and release. This is what you’ve been planning for months, so you’d better drink that expensive wine and eat that expensive food. Mingle with your guests and eat a second piece of cake. Don’t worry about any stress, as it will be over the next day.


Don’t sweat the small stuff. Maybe it rained in your pictures or the food was late. Try not to get worked up over things that were out of your control. This can put you in a bad mindset and you don’t want to be cranky the night of your wedding.
Change those heels for more comfortable shoes. Having an intimate wedding means that you’ve got a small amount of guests to interact with. Get out there, talk to them and watch them enjoy your hard work.Select a male and female host to deal with any social faux-pas. If you think you might have a creepy cousin or a wine-happy aunt, delegate an affable friend or family member to help deal with any awkwardness. Having picked someone in advance to de-escalate any conflicts means you can relax and enjoy yourself, rather than worrying about playing therapist to your guests.

Designate a table for kids at the wedding.,
Set up a fort.,
Have a crafts area.,
Create a games table.",How to Entertain Kids at Your Wedding1," If you are planning on having more than one or two kids at your wedding, create a table just for kids. This is an ideal option if the kids are all over the age of 5, as they can usually be on their own around other children without too much adult supervision. Consider if the kids you are inviting to the wedding will be okay on their own without their parents at the same table. If so, a kids table may be the best option for keeping the kids in one place. It will also encourage them to play together.Place the kids table close to the table with their parents or some of their parents. This can make it easier for parents to keep an eye on their kids but still give the kids some freedom.;
, Another option is to create a fort or a tent for kids to play in at your wedding. This may be a good option if you have very young children coming to the wedding and want to create a space where they can nap, relax, and play. Put pillows and stuffed animals in the tent to encourage kids to relax in it during the wedding or reception.You can also put books and games in the fort to make it more kid-friendly.

, To keep kids entertained, set up a crafts area at the wedding. Spread butcher paper on the long table for the kids to use. Include finger paint, washable markers, colored pencils, colored paper, glitter, and stickers at the table. Put out items to decorate masks or coloring books that the kids can color on their own.You may have a directed craft, such as the decorating of a mask or a blank wedding bell. Or you may let the kids do their own craft.

, You can also keep kids entertained by setting up a games table for them at the reception. Have board games appropriate for all ages on the table as well as simple games for younger children. Include games where the kids can play against each other or together as a team.For example, you may include games like Connect 4 or Guess Who for younger children. You could then include board games like Monopoly or Pictionary for older kids.
You could also set up video games for the kids to play, especially if you know a few of them are avid gamers.

Have a backup plan for inclement weather.,
Select reliable vendors.,
Get signed contracts and receipts from the venue and vendors.,
Ask vendors to show up 45 minutes before you actually need them.,
Make sure you don't run out of food.,
Consider buying wedding insurance.",How to Avoid Common Wedding Day Disasters1," Outdoor weddings can be beautiful, but there’s always the risk of bad weather disrupting the ceremony. One common solution is to put up a large tented covering, or have one on hand just in case.You could also have large golf umbrellas on hand for guests in rainy weather or, if you know a cold front is coming, buy some heavy fleece blankets to pass out to guests.Ask your venue if they have a backup generator on site. If a storm knocks the power out, there should be a plan in place to restore it immediately.Even indoor weddings can be affected by bad weather if parking isn’t located near the venue’s entrance. Have several large umbrellas on hand and task two people in the wedding party with possible valet duties.;
, Ask friends and family for vendor recommendations rather than blindly seeking out unknown companies on your own. Whenever you can’t get a recommendation for a needed vendor, research each company you are considering carefully before making a final decision. Look over their website and get a solid idea of what the company provides. Check their social media pages and search online for customer reviews, as well.Choosing local vendors is a good idea for several reasons – you can go talk to them in person before you hire them and, in the event they forgot something at their facility, making a quick run back won’t take them very long.

, Make sure a contract is drawn up and signed for each vendor you book. The contract should specify exactly who is providing the service and what that service is. Try to add a clause to contracts that allows you to terminate services before the wedding if the vendor proves unreliable. Keep receipts for down payments and any other expenses., If a vendor arrives late, it could throw off your entire wedding schedule, especially when it comes to crucial entities like the officiant, the caterer or the DJ/musicians. Figure out when vendors need to begin setting up and then ask them to arrive 30 to 45 minutes before that time. That will allow plenty of time for set up and give you a small cushion of time to deal with any last minute issues.Make sure the DJ or live band tests the sound system before the reception begins., Speak with your caterer to prepare for the amount of food needed for the reception. The most important information to relay to your cater is the number of guests you're expecting and the length of the event. The number and size of food item selections also factors in. When making a final decision, always round up to avoid the embarrassing situation of running out of food.Include options for guests with special dietary needs, like vegetarian or gluten-free food.

, There are insurance companies, such as WedSafe, that specialize in wedding insurance policies. These policies are fairly affordable and will reimburse your expenses in the event a vendor or venue breaks a contract or no-shows. For about $300 dollars you can purchase a policy that will insure a $35,000 wedding."

Have a disposable camera scavenger hunt.,
Set up outdoor games.,
Hold a craft contest.,
Have a kids-only dance off.,
Hire professional entertainment for the kids.",How to Entertain Kids at Your Wedding2," To keep kids entertained during the wedding, set up a scavenger hunt involving disposable cameras. Write out a list of several items the kids have to locate and snap on their cameras during the wedding. The first kid to get all the items on the list will then win a prize.For example, you may write, “Find a white flower” or “Get a picture with the groom.”

, If your wedding is going to be outdoors, set up a sports center for the kids to play in during the reception. You could set up sports games like lawn bowling or mini golf. Or you could put out soccer balls, basketballs, and softballs for the kids to play with.You could also arrange old fashioned races at the reception to wear out the kids and keep them busy. For example, you may set up three legged races, a sock hop, or a relay race.

, You can also encourage the kids to get into the craft area at the wedding by holding a contest where the winner’s craft is displayed at the bride and groom table. This can help to motivate the kids to work hard on their crafts and reward them for being diligent in the craft corner during the wedding.


For example, say to the kids, “We’re holding a craft contest. Whoever makes the most detailed craft will win a chance to display it at the bride and groom table.”
Alternatively, you could reward all of the kids by displaying all of their crafts at the bride and groom table. This may be a better way to be inclusive and encouraging to all the kids at the wedding.

, Another fun way to keep kids entertained is to have a dance off just for them. Maybe you have the wedding DJ invite all the kids to the dance floor and encourage them to dance to kid-friendly songs in a big circle. This could be a fun way to get the kids to feel special and included. It will also help them to burn off energy and keep them occupied while the adults are interacting.Hiring a good DJ will make having the dance off much easier. Look for a DJ who can cater to adults and kids. Make sure the DJ has kid-friendly songs on their playlist.

, If you do not want to stress about creating activities for the kids yourself, hire professional kid entertainment for the wedding. You may hire a magician or a clown for the kids. Or you may look for a professional balloon animal maker or a professional all around kid entertainer.Ask your wedding planner for recommendations for a professional entertainer. You can also search for kid-friendly entertainers in your area online or through bridal magazines.

Encourage parents to remove kids who are fussy during the ceremony.,
Give kids confetti to toss at the wedding.,
Arrange for kid-friendly food and drinks at the reception.,
Have the kids eat separate from the adults.",How to Entertain Kids at Your Wedding3," Having kids in attendance at the wedding ceremony can be a nice way to include adults and their families. But of course, kids will be kids and may have a hard time sitting still during the ceremony. You may let parents know that they can take kids to a different area or outside of the wedding venue if their kids start to fuss or get bored. Do this in a friendly, open way so parents know this is an option.For example, you may have the master of ceremonies announce, “Parents, feel free to take your children outside if they start to get fussy during the ceremony.”

, You can keep children entertained on your big day by giving them a job or role at your wedding. Hand out confetti to the kids at the beginning of the ceremony and tell them to throw the confetti on the bride and groom at the end of the ceremony. They will enjoy having a job and feel part of the wedding.For example, you may tell the kids, “Here is some confetti. When the bride and groom walk down the aisle at the end of the ceremony, throw the confetti on them to celebrate.”

, To make sure the kids at your wedding feel included, have kid-friendly food and drinks ready for them at the reception. This may be mini burgers, fish fingers, and french fries as appetizers before dinner. You may also make sure the bar has juice and soda for the kids so they have something to drink.You should also make sure there are kid-friendly meals available for dinner, if you are hosting dinner as part of your wedding. The portions for the kids should be smaller and contain food that is familiar and appetizing to kids.

, You may try dividing the dinner into two, one dinner time for kids and one for adults. Most children will want to eat quickly and then go back to playing. To accommodate this, allow the kids to be served first so they can eat and move on to another activity. This will then free up the adults to linger over their meals and socialize.For example, if you have a buffet style dinner, let the kids go first through the buffet. Then, have the adults go after them. If you have a multi-course meal planned, you may simplify it for kids and give them one course so they can eat and move on to another activity.

Practice your vows ahead of time.,
Hold a wedding rehearsal of some kind.,
Bring a master copy of vows, readings and toasts to the ceremony.,
Put someone in charge of the certificate and rings.,
Have a plan for children and unexpected guests.",How to Avoid Common Wedding Day Disasters2," If you’ve been planning your wedding for months, chances are all of the attire (bridal gown, tuxes, wedding party attire) was chosen well in advance. A few months ago, those garments may have fit everyone perfectly. However, everyone should try on their wedding attire a couple of weeks before the ceremony takes place to confirm a good fit. This will allow for any last-minute tailoring to take place, if necessary., Bring emergency items like a mini-sewing kit, double-sided tape and safety pins with you to prevent wardrobe mishaps. Some other essential items to consider including in your kit are tweezers, breath mints, aspirin, stain remover, dental floss, hair spray and band-aids., On the day of the ceremony, bouquets and arrangements will be moved around and jostled quite a bit. This could cause flower petals to wilt before the ceremony even begins. To avoid this, select blooms that hold up against heat and touch.

Some sturdy options are garden roses, cymbidium orchids, dahlias, peonies, mini calla lilies, and chocolate sunflowers.Keep the bouquets nestled in vases of water until right before the ceremony to keep the blooms in peak condition.

, Whether you’re writing your own vows or going with something more traditional, practicing ahead of time will help you feel more confident. Write out your vows and practice them out loud many times. If it helps, practice in front of a mirror. You could also use a voice recording app on your phone to record yourself, play it back, and tweak your delivery to perfection.Don’t wait until the last minute to write your own vows! Plan them out well ahead of time so that you have plenty of time to practice them.
Consider providing a copy of your vows to the officiant. If you find yourself too emotional to speak or your mind goes blank, the officiant can quietly prompt you.

, Many couples these days prefer to skip the expense of an elaborate rehearsal the night before the wedding. At the very least, you should have some sort of informal run-through of the ceremony with the entire wedding party present. Ideally you should rehearse most of the ceremony, but if that isn’t possible, even a basic run-through of the most important parts of the ceremony can be invaluable.Make sure no one in the wedding party is allergic to the flowers used for bouquets and boutonnières., Task the maid of honor or best man to carry a master copy of these important elements to the ceremony. If someone needs to reference a document at the last minute, it can be done quickly and easily.

To avoid having extra stuff for them to carry, you could even scan these documents into a cell phone to be digitally referenced.

, Some of the more obvious things, like the marriage certificate and wedding rings, are often forgotten in the flurry of activity leading up to the ceremony. Put someone in charge of these to ensure all goes smoothly., Decide upfront whether you want children in attendance at your wedding. Make sure your guests know your decision by including a line on your save-the-dates and/or your wedding website: ""The reception is adults-only."" Be very clear about plus-ones on your invitations, but be prepared with extra chairs and extra food just in case.If children do show up, you can discreetly ask the family to move to the back of the venue (especially if the children get fussy).

Start as early as possible.,
Choose a venue 12 to 14 months out.,
Make a budget and stick to it.",How to Avoid Common Wedding Day Disasters3," Even if you’re planning a long engagement, the sooner you start planning the wedding, the less stressful the process will be. Immediately after the engagement you should set an approximate budget and estimate the number of guests you plan to invite. These items are crucial when it comes to booking a venue, which is the first major wedding decision that needs to be made, and one of the most costly., Finding the perfect venue takes time and research. When you finally do find the venue you want, it could be booked as far as a year in advance. Before you set the date for your wedding, find the venue of your dreams. Once you’ve nailed down the venue and booked it, you then have a time frame to work within for the rest of the planning., Get a clear idea of how much money you have to work with. Create a list of expenses and set to work getting price quotes and researching your options.You may want to consider opening up a bank account where wedding monies can be deposited. This will help you keep track of how much you’re spending more easily."

The honored couple should then begin to dance with a significant family member such as a parent or sibling inside the circle as the guests continue to loosely dance around them in the outside circle.
After the significant couples have all danced in the middle, the outer circle of guests take their turns in the center dancing, clapping, or sometimes acting out different aspects of married life, such as holding a baby, or building a house. Some guests may choose to shout out short versus or cheers when they enter the circle, in honor of the married couple, while the rest of the group clap in time.

Identify the most important family member in your life.,
Go traditional and ask your father.,
Consider asking a stepparent.,
Go for a close family member if your parents have passed.,
Ask your son or daughter if you are getting remarried.",How to Choose Who Walks You Down the Aisle1," It may help to start by thinking about who is the most important family member in your life and then consider asking that person to walk you down the aisle. Perhaps you consider your brother your most important person in your life. Or maybe the first person that pops into your head is your single mother who raised you on her own.You may write down a few people who are important to you in your family on a piece of paper and then choose one from the list. Or you may discuss the most important family members in your life with your partner or another family member and come up with the right person together.
Keep in mind you can be walked down the aisle by more than one person. For example, you may realize that your mother and your father are both important to you, and decide to ask them both to walk you down the aisle. This is your wedding after all, so you can make it your own.;
, Traditionally, the bride is escorted down the aisle by her father. If you want to go traditional, you may decide to ask your father to accompany you down the aisle. This can be an option in heterosexual marriage and same-sex marriage for a dash of tradition in the ceremony.You may opt for asking a father figure in your life if you are not close to your biological father, such as a mentor, a coach, or a close family friend.

, Perhaps your biological parent has passed or is still alive, but you were raised by a stepparent. You may decide to ask your stepparent to walk you down the aisle to honor their contribution to your life. Or you may ask both stepparents to walk you down the aisle to honor them both.If your biological parent or parents are still alive, you may feel a bit awkward asking a stepparent to walk you down the aisle. One option is to have one biological parent and one stepparent walk you down the aisle together.

, If your parents are no longer alive, you may consider reaching out to a family member you are close to. This could be an uncle, an aunt, or a cousin. You may also ask a grandparent, if they are still alive, or a sibling you are close to.Walking down the aisle with a sibling or another family member may be a good way to honor the memory of your parents as a family and acknowledge their contribution to your lives.

, If you are getting remarried to a new partner, you may find you are closer to your son or daughter than to other family. You may decide to ask your child or two of your children to walk you down the aisle.This is a good option for individuals who are older in age and getting married, as they may not be as close to their parents as they are to their children.

Decide the scope of your wedding memory book.,
Look through the proofs of your wedding photos and mark the ones that stand out to you.,
Out of your top choices, pick the must-have photos.,
Think of meaningful moments you may have missed with the initial scouring of your photos that are integral to telling the story of your relationship with your spouse.,
Leave at least 30% of your photo album for photos with top-notch aestheticism.,
Decide on a theme for your book.,
Decide on a color scheme for your book.,
Design the front and back covers.,
Physically organize your proofs in order to tell a story with your wedding album.,
Put it all together!",How to Create a Wedding Memory Book," Do you want to just document the wedding-related events (the proposal, dress selection, bridal shower, wedding day, etc.) or would you like to include memorable events throughout your relationship and engagement? This determines the length and photo selection of your book.;
, Go with your gut feeling and err on the side of inclusion -- you can sort out the bad ones later. Don't spend too much time over thinking each photo.

, First, throw out the photos that are unflattering or contain mistakes. Next, pick out 15-20 of your favorites that will definitely be included in the album. The remaining photos are available if space permits.

, Find photos to represent those significant times. Consider captioning those moments in the book -- or if you think that would clash with your album theme, just know that you can always tell the story verbally whenever you share your album with others.

, All of your photos should be well-composed, but these stand out in the way that they look. Even if these photos are less meaningful, they tie the whole book together into a work of art.


These can include people or just feature beautiful details like flower arrangements, wedding cakes, food, the venue, etc.Consider professional photos taken on your bridal shower or wedding day. In fact, you may want to get professional advice on photo composition to help you pick out the best photos.

, Pick a look-and-feel that represents your and your spouse's relationship. This should be something you both agree on and both visually enjoy. Some examples you can consider are:


Elegant: Leather-bound covers (perhaps trimmed with lace or finished with a chiffon bow), fancy script font, thick glossy pages and nude colors. You may make your album entirely or partially with black-and-white photos to heighten the sophistication. Your photos may mostly include ""candids"" and scenery shots.
Modern: A plastic hardcover album with matte pages and minimal color (probably black and white), though you may decide you want one color (e.g., red) to run through and highlight important things in the book. There will be an emphasis on shapes and typography, and how all of these elements fit together in the book. You may want to align your photos in artistic placements instead of what photo albums usually look like.
Classic: Black glossy cover and black pages, with one photo in the center of each page. Black is a great backdrop for emphasizing photos of any color, so make sure that the ones you pick are of exceptional quality in color and resolution. No captions, because the photos speak for themselves. Typography should be simple and kept consistent.

, You may have already done this when thinking about the theme, but nevertheless, it's important to have a specified palette of colors to choose from for various aspects of the album.


Think about questions like: what color do you want the pages to be? What colors do you want the text and the emphasized text to be? How do these colors mesh with the color of the pages/covers and the colors of the photos?

, Do you want to include a photo of you and your spouse, or would you rather feature a photo of a symbolic object? Alternatively, you may choose to keep it simple with a single-color cover and aesthetically-pleasing typography.

, You'll probably want it to be displayed chronologically, but feel free to organize in a way that appeals to you. At this point, you may notice that you have forgotten some parts of your story with the photos that you chose -- it's not too late to go back through your proofs to substitute photos in.


As you lay out the pictures, think of what size you want to use for each photo. This can vary from page to page, but you probably want photos on two pages that face each other to be congruent. You may want to blow up extremely important photos -- e.g., the exchange of wedding vows -- to take up the whole page, but keep photos of the food and decorations to 5""x7"".

, Even if you have designed everything yourself up to this point, you may want to consult professionals to complete the actual book. They will be sure to make the binding straight, mount the photos exactly, etc., and you can dictate the look and feel of the entire project.

Choose a color palette that enhances the natural beauty of the beach.",How to Decorate for a Beach Wedding Reception1," While any colors that the bride and groom like are appropriate, most beach wedding receptions feature light colors that mimic the beach, water, sun and seashells.

, There may be a close friend of the family who has been in your life since childhood or during a pivotal time in your life, such as a good friend of your father’s or your mother’s.

You may enlist a pet you and your family own or a pet you and your partner own together. Having a pet accompany you can be a unique and interesting addition to your wedding.If you do end up enlisting a pet to walk you down the aisle, you should make sure you practice the walk with them several times so they are prepared on the day of the wedding.

, For a non-conventional approach, you may decide to walk down the aisle alone. This approach can be a way for you to express your independence and try a non-traditional way to run your wedding. You may also feel more comfortable walking down the aisle alone than with family or a friend.You and your partner may also decide to forgo the walk down the aisle tradition to family or a friend and walk down the aisle together. This can be a way for you to feel connected and part of a pair at your wedding from the very start of the ceremony.

, Let the person know you want to ask them an important question and that you hope they say yes. You might explain to them that they have been an important person in your life. You may then phrase the question by asking, ""Will you do me the honor of walking me down the aisle at my wedding?"" Or you may ask, ""Would you be willing to be a part of my wedding and walk me down the aisle?""

, Once the person accepts your request, you may worry about others in your life who will be upset that you did not ask them. You may also have people in your life who expected they would be asked and may be disappointed by your choice. You should reassure them that you choose the person for specific reasons and because you have the ability to decide who is part of your wedding. You may also tell others that you made your decision by going with your heart or your gut, and not to slight or offend anyone close to you.For example, you may say, ""I'm sorry if you're upset about my decision but I went with the person I felt was right for the role. I hope you will still support me on my special day.""

Select a theme for the wedding reception.",How to Decorate for a Beach Wedding Reception2," Tropical, nautical, Hawaiian and nature motifs are popular for beach wedding receptions. Because the options for beach wedding decorations are seemingly endless and quite diverse in style, it is easier to plan decorations around a theme. For example, you could have guests wear leis and decorate tables with hibiscus flowers for a Hawaiian theme. Or use oars, anchors and ships flags to decorate for a nautical theme. A nature theme might include only natural materials found on the beach, such as driftwood and shells.

Determine the table centerpieces for your beach wedding reception.",How to Decorate for a Beach Wedding Reception3," The table centerpieces should carry out the theme, color palette and overall decor of the wedding. Because they are highly visible, centerpieces are an easy way to make a decorative impact. Make sure the centerpieces are not too large that guests can't speak over or around them, but not so small that they don't get noticed.


Consider a beach bucket centerpiece. Paint galvanized buckets in colors that match the color palette for the reception. Glue embellishments to the outside of the bucket that complement the wedding reception theme, such as seashells or starfish. Fill the buckets with fresh flowers, tropical fruit or seashells.
Select an aquarium centerpiece. Pour sand and seashells into a fish bowl. For a fun and unexpected centerpiece, add water and some goldfish. If you decide to add live goldfish, be sure to have a few extra on hand in case one goes belly up during the reception.
Decorate with rustic beach lanterns. Situate a lantern in the middle of the table. Add sand, flower petals and/or shells on the table around the lantern. The beach lanterns also can provide light for an evening wedding reception.
Create flower arrangements with tropical flowers. Exotic flowers like orchids, heliconias, hibiscus, protias, gingers and bird of paradise can be used to create centerpieces that not only look beautiful, but smell great, too. Most tropical flowers can withstand the heat, sun and sand of a beach wedding reception, but check with your florist before selecting blooms.
Use native beach grasses as a centerpiece. Wrap natural beach grasses in ribbon or jute string, and place them inside tall glass containers filled with pebbles or shells.
Decorate with sand castles or sand sculptures. To enhance the theme of a beach wedding reception, use sand castles as table centerpieces. In addition to traditional sand castles, you may consider sand sculptures in the shape of hearts or created to look like the bride and groom. Be sure the sand sculptures are covered with clear glass containers so sand does not blow on reception guests.
Decorate with candles. Put candles in a glass container filled with sand, shells or sea glass. If wind is an issue, consider using electric candles in the place of traditional candles.

"
"
Use beach-themed favors to decorate for the wedding reception.",How to Decorate for a Beach Wedding Reception4," Favors are a way to thank your guests for attending your wedding. They also can add to the décor of your reception when placed on the guest tables.


Consider miniature beach pails filled with candy. Fill small galvanized pails with your favorite candy or beach-theme candies, such as salt water taffy or candy pebbles.
Provide miniature beach items. Give your guests small versions of popular beach items, such as flip flop key chains, sailboat note pads or sun-shaped bag tags.
Give your guests customized water bottles, beach towels or flip flops. Create water bottle labels with the names of the bride and groom and wedding date. Provide inexpensive flip flops in a variety of sizes customized with the wedding date or location. Offer beach towels embroidered with the bride and groom's monogram. Depending on the formality of the event, guests can use these items at the wedding and/or reception, and then take them home as favors.

"
"
Select appropriate lighting for an outdoor beach reception.",How to Decorate for a Beach Wedding Reception5," If the wedding reception is at night, you will need to add outdoor lighting to the event space. Depending on the location of the reception, you may not have access to electricity. If electricity is not available on site, consider renting a generator to plug in electric lights, or rely on candles and battery-operated lighting sources.


Provide lighting through flaming tiki torches. Situate tiki torches around the perimeter of your event space. Be sure the tiki torches are not near anything flammable.
Utilize twinkle lights to illuminate your space. String twinkle lights overhead, along the perimeters of the reception space or on the tables to add a warm glow to your reception.
Place candles inside tall hurricane glasses throughout the reception. You can use the candles on guest tables, buffets, cake table, bar and other sturdy surfaces.

"
"
Make arrangements for inclement weather.",How to Decorate for a Beach Wedding Reception6," If your beach wedding reception is outdoors, it is important to prepare for unpredictable weather. As you plan your decorations, keep unpredictable weather in mind.


Rent a tent for your wedding reception. Most event tents come with sides that roll up, so if the weather is nice, you can roll up the sides of the tent and let guests enjoy the beautiful beach views. In the event of rain, intense wind or cold temperatures, you can unroll the sides of the tent to protect your guests from the weather.
Rent space heaters. Even in the summer, ocean-side temperatures can cool significantly in the evening. Keep guests warm by placing space heaters throughout the reception area.
Use sturdy decorations. Because beaches typically are more windy than protected inland locations, decorations need to be sturdy enough not to blow away in wind gusts. Anchor decorations with rocks or heavy shells, or look for centerpieces with wide bases.

Keep things moving.",How to Direct a Wedding," Some wedding directors plan the entire wedding, from start to finish, while others come in on the day of the wedding and run the show. Let the couple take on whatever responsibilities they'd like to be a part of, and take responsibility for the rest of the planning yourself.


It's important to offer your guidance and to freely share your opinions, but remember that the decisions are ultimately up to the couple. If you think it's a terrible idea to try to combine a hog roast with a winter wedding, you may explain what you think will be challenging about it, but accept the couple's decision.;
, If you're going to be planning a wedding from start to finish with a couple, it's important to learn as much as you can about the couple getting married. You'll need to spend a bit of time with the couple to make sure that your decisions and plans for the service and the reception will please the couple.


At the very least, you'll meet privately three times with the couple, and stay in touch throughout the process. You should meet once to get to know the couple, another to update them and present them with options, and a few weeks before the reception to go over the schedule and plans.
Meet informally at first, going out for coffee or dinner to learn as much about the couple as possible. Find out how they met, what ambitions they have for their marriage, and other personal details. This can help you make decisions., A good wedding planner should be knowledgeable about good reception halls, churches, caterers, and other services associated with getting a wedding together. If the couple asks if you have a good vegan caterer in mind, you should be able to come up with a list of five options very quickly. This is part of your job.


This should be the bulk of your job: doing the research. It's very important to get your name out there as a wedding planner and make contacts in the catering and the wedding business.
As you try out different places, take lots of pictures and secure samples if possible, so the couple will be able to make an informed decision. Leave your card at each business.

, Once you've got some idea of what might work for the couple's wedding, present them with a variety of options before you move forward. For food, decoration, possible venues, music, and other options, you want to provide the couple with a list of about 3-5 options to choose from.


In some cases, couples will have lots of opinions, while other couples will be happier to let you do the load of the work and make the decisions for them. Not everyone will be the same.
Come up with a few ""complete packages."" Maybe a particular caterer, a particular color scheme and flower arrangement, and a particular band you think might go well together for this couple. Go ahead and group the different options into packages the couple can choose from, to make it easier.

, Your job will be defined in part by the couple whose wedding you're directing. If you need to schedule and organize a pre-rehearsal cocktail party, or a post-dinner reception somewhere, you need to find out and schedule these things for the couple, or decide together what additional events, other than the ceremony, will be scheduled. All of the following are common wedding events:


Rehearsal and rehearsal dinner
Pre or post-rehearsal cocktails
Photography session
Pre-wedding brunch
Tour of wedding facility

, Couples can start to get antsy as the day approaches, and you might be inundated with phone calls, or you might never hear from the couple until a few days for the wedding. Every couple will be different. Either way, it's a good idea to stay in touch with the couple and let them know how things are progressing.Eventually, you'll get to the point of no return, at which you won't be able to make changes anymore. At this point, make sure the couple knows that it's too late to have a change of heart about the type of food that will be prepared, or whatever the case may be.

, Wedding ceremonies generally take place either outdoors, in pastoral settings, or indoors in a church of the bride and groom's choosing. Couples may have very specific locations in mind, or may only have a very general idea of a type of location, making your input critical.



Indoor weddings need to be matched to the religion and specific denomination of the couple. You wouldn't want to book a protestant couple to be wed at a Catholic church, or the service would be somewhat surprising. In some cases, couples may want to be wed at other types of indoor venues, like a historical-register home, a local dining hall, or other aesthetically beautiful historical property.

Outdoor weddings can take place at a variety of locations, including beaches, on private wooded properties, apple orchards, wineries, or even in State or National Parks. Talk to the couple about their ideal outdoor setting and come up with a variety of local options. Ideally, the property will also offer an indoor venue for the reception.

, Couples may have an idea of who they would like to perform the wedding, or they may not. Depending on where the wedding will be booked, you might have easy access to an officiant for the wedding in the minister at the specific church, or you may need to find one.


Generally, the officiant will be chosen by the couple. If they have no leads, you might inquire about their religious background and call local churches, a magistrate or justice of the peace (which being civil is more legally binding than a religious ceremony) one to request a consultation with the couple, to select potential officiants.

, Most wedding services involve some kind of music, and song selection and variety of performance can be an important way of adding pageantry and whimsy to the proceedings. It can be hard to know where to start for first-time couples, so it's important to have a good list of suggestions in terms of song and performance selection.


String quartets and solo instrumentalists are probably the most common live-performance options for weddings, and many performers advertise their wedding performance services commercially. Recorded music is also a good and cheap option.
Generally, a service will consist of prelude music, which is played during the procession, and then music played during the bride's arrival, which is generally ""Bridal Chorus"" by Wagner (commonly known as ""Here comes the bride"").Other common wedding music includes instrumental versions of the following songs:

Arlen & Harburg's ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow""
Handel's ""Arrival of the Queen of Sheba""
Mendelssohn's ""Wedding March""
Pachelbel's ""Canon in D""



, Most weddings will have seasonal flowers that are professionally arranged by a local florist. It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the florists in the area, as well as scout their wedding packages and pricing options to provide to the couple for selection.


Discuss color schemes for the bridal party's attire with the couple, to help them decide on complementary color schemes for the floral arrangements.

, Wedding photographers aren't difficult to find, but it's a good idea to research all the available options and be able to provide a pricing guide for the couple to choose between. The quality of the photographers, the reliability of the photographer, and the professionalism are all important.


Spend some time with representatives of each studio on the phone to get a sense of who does the best business, and recommend that photographer to the couple.

, It's important for the director to be familiar with the set-up of the location or locations that will be involved the day of the wedding. You need to make sure the caterers know where to be and when to be there, when the building opens up for business, and how much seating to prepare for.

, The rehearsal is when the bridal party does a quick run-through of the ceremony, mostly focusing on the processional. This can be a nerve-calmer for the couple, but it's most important for you in nailing the timing of everything and making sure that the wedding will get off without a hitch. It's your job to organize everyone with the officiant, coordinating the music and other scheduling concerns of the ceremony, if necessary.


Practice the timing of sending party members down the aisle and ensure that each member knows exactly where to stand.
Provide everyone with your cell phone number the day of the wedding to answer any last-minute problems that come up. Be available.

, Wedding receptions often take place in adjacent properties to the ceremony, sometimes within the same building, or they may take place at a residence, or other type of larger venue, depending on the size of the wedding that you're directing.Generally speaking, receptions will be held indoors, in large-sized banquet halls, and will feature catering and dancing, so you'll need to find ideal locations for holding such an event. Research local:


Banquet halls
Union halls
Churches with large fellowship halls
Historical properties on the registry
Wineries

, Most receptions will consist of a meal, some informal comments, desert, and dancing. Once the dancing starts, your job is mostly done, so the meal is the last big thing you've really got to make sure gets off without a hitch. Talk to the couple about their ideal wedding meal and discuss the possible options for presenting it.


Research local caterers and provide meal plans and pricing options for the couple. try to provide a variety of upscale and more affordable selections. Simple chicken dishes might be fine for some couples, while others will want more elaborate fare.
Many receptions are organized buffett style, allowing guests to serve themselves, while others prefer a more formal dining option, with waiters. This will mean more coordination for you, but a more formal experience for the reception.
You'll also likely need to research local bakeries and wedding cake makers for the cake, if necessary. It's a good idea to go over sizing, flavor, and design options for the wedding cake.

, If the reception is to be outdoors, it's usually common to use circus-style tents from a local vendor, which can be set up about 24-hours ahead of time on the property where the reception will take place. It will be your job to find covering and seating sufficient enough for the entire party and guest list.

, Generally, receptions are presided over by live bands or DJs who specialize in playing music for after-dinner partying. Not every couple will have a strong opinion about the entertainment, so it's a good idea to research local wedding DJs with a tasteful repertoire of tunes who are experienced at entertaining an all-ages crowd of wedding guests.

, Once you've got the couple's go-ahead, start scheduling everything. Call the caterer, the florist, and the other wedding hires and make sure everything's in order for the event.


It's usually a good idea to keep the notes for each wedding that you plan in a separate three-ring binder so you can keep everything straight. You don't want the florist from one wedding showing up to the chapel of another.

, Find out how many bridal party members are attending, and how many members of the groom's party will be attending. Create a master guest list, or ask for one to be provided. Discuss seating arrangements with the bride and groom, and consider your options for additional seating, if required.


If you're not planing the wedding itself, but will be directing the day-of-wedding operations, you need to learn as much as possible about what's already been planned, as well as the bride and groom's desires for their special day.

, Discuss the timeline with the bride and groom once it is complete and adjust the timeline during rehearsal, if necessary. When does everyone need to line up? When will the wedding start? Approximately how long will it take? These are questions you will need to be in charge of the day of the wedding.Set times for the bridal party to arrive at the wedding and coordinate the schedule for photo sessions with the photographer.
To keep things as stress free as possible, you usually don't want to be mixing caterers, florists, photographers, and guests all at the same time. Try to space out the time you'll need to organize each thing separately.

, It's your job to make sure everyone knows where they'll need to be and when they'll need to be there, not just the bride or the groom's. You should be the face of the operation, the person who everyone will come to with questions, so be proactive at the rehearsal and the day of the wedding.

, It's your job to oversee everything on the day of the wedding, from the arrival of the caterers and the band, to the setting out of chairs, to the floral arrangements, to the wedding processional.


Delegate tasks as needed. You can't do everything yourself and it's likely that you'll need some help getting everyone on the same page.
One often-forgotten but critical aspect of wedding direction is coordinating parking. If the wedding takes place in two different locations, you'll need to make sure there's enough parking at both, and that everyone knows where and where not to park their car.

, It will be your job to contact and schedule the caterers and other service workers for the wedding about a week before the wedding, and to help them out with anything they need the day of. Be available to handle practical concerns as they arise with the catering crew.

, Different weddings will have a variety of different events happening during the reception, and it can be difficult to fit it all in. You want to be gentle, but firm, in getting the bridal party to move forward with the scheduled plans, to make sure everyone can get out of the rented space on time.


Try to schedule things with a 30 minute swing window, because you don't want to have to rule over the party with an iron fist. It's supposed to be a party, and people will want to chat and celebrate with the couple.
If something can't fit into the schedule, leave it up to the couple whether or not they want to abandon it.

Add some shimmer to the neutrals.,
Opt for white flowers.,

Neutrals are often paired with bolder colors in warm or cool tones as a way to balance the palette. However, using a mostly neutral palette can give you a chic, understated look.If you want to incorporate bold, bright colors in your wedding decor, such as red, turquoise, or yellow, you’ll definitely want to mix in some neutrals, such as beige, white, gray, or black, to soften the look of the decorations.
By using mostly neutral colors, it’s much easier to mix and match decorations.;
, When you’re trying to decide on what neutrals to use for your decoration, it’s important to take your wedding venue into account. In a small space, you’ll want to use lighter neutrals to help brighten the venue and make it appear larger. In a large space with high ceilings, using darker neutrals can help make the venue feel more intimate.Light neutrals that you may want to consider for your wedding decorations include white, cream, beige, tan, taupe, and light gray.
Dark neutrals that you may want to consider for your wedding decorations include black, navy, charcoal, and chocolate brown.

, Another factor that can help you decide which neutrals to use for your wedding decor is the season. In spring and summer, lighter neutrals are typically the best option. For fall and winter weddings, darker neutrals usually work better.While the seasonal color theory can help provide guidance, you don’t have to adhere to it. If you want to use light neutrals and pastels for the decorations at a winter wedding, go for it. Choose the colors that feel right to you no matter what season it is.

, If you don’t want to go all neutral for your wedding’s decor, you’ll need to choose accent shade(s) to pop against the neutrals that you use. Neutrals are particularly helpful if you want to use bold, bright accent colors because they’ll help soften the more dramatic shades.As a general rule, you don’t want to use more than four or five colors for your wedding’s decorating scheme.
You can pair multiple neutral shades with just a single accent color to help it really stand out. For example, white, gray, and canary yellow can make a striking decorating scheme.
You can pair just a single neutral shade with multiple accent shades to help create a balanced look. For example, you might pair white with chartreuse, cornflower blue, and powder blue.
The accent colors that you pair with the neutrals don’t necessarily have to be bright or vivid. You can create a pretty color palette for your wedding decorations by pairing the neutrals with soft shades, such as mint, sky blue, peach, sage, blush pink, lilac, and/or butter yellow.

, If you’re worried about the neutral decorations at your wedding looking flat or boring, it can help to incorporate some shimmer. For example, simple taupe chair covers may seem drab, but sequined taupe covers can add some serious glam to the decor.While shimmery neutrals can add sophistication to your wedding, don’t go overboard. Having too many sequined or metallic decorations can often make the decor look busy.

, One of the easiest ways to incorporate neutrals in your wedding decor is through the flowers in your centerpieces. Instead of choosing arrangements in bright, bold colors, create elegant centerpieces with white flowers. They will coordinate with virtually any other decorations that you plan for the tables and add a brightness to the display at the same time.Some white flowers to consider for your centerpieces include carnations, calla lilies, chrysanthemums, daisies, dahlias, magnolias, irises, tulips, and roses.
You can also use white flowers for the bridal party’s bouquets. Make the bride’s bouquet stand out by mixing a few brighter colored flowers among the white blooms.

, When it comes to the vases for your floral arrangements, you don’t necessarily have to use white or cream containers that might blend in too easily with the flowers. Instead, opt for clear glass vases that will essentially serve as a neutral in the display and allow the flowers to really stand out.Mercury glass is a striking option for vases at your wedding. The subtle silvering gives them a bit more interest, but it won’t ruin the neutral effect of the glass.

, Adding some candles to the centerpieces or table displays at your wedding is another easy way to work some neutral shades into the decor. Many candles come in neutral shades such as white, cream, or beige, so they’ll easily coordinate with the other centerpiece decorations.Candles also provide soft mood lighting that can give your wedding a more romantic feel.

, The wedding cake is often the centerpiece of the event’s decor. Continue the neutral theme by choosing a simple cake. A pure white cake can seem a little stark, but a soft neutral such as cream, beige, or nude can make an elegant statement for your cake.If an entirely neutral cake seems too plain, you can add decorations in muted shades to liven up its look. For example, blush, mint, and peach accents can dress up a simple cream colored wedding cake.

, You can easily incorporate more neutrals in your wedding decor through the table cloths and chair covers. White table cloths are an obvious choice, but you can opt for cream or ivory for a softer look. Light gray and taupe are also lovely options.Linens in darker neutrals such as black or navy are ideal for evening weddings.

, Wood may not technically be a “color,” but it functions as a neutral in decor. Consider using wooden signage throughout the venue, wooden trays for holding the guest cards, or wooden blocks as part of the centerpieces.Lighter woods, such as maple, oak, pine, and ash, typically work best as neutrals for decor.
If your wedding has a rustic theme, you can leave the wood unfinished.
You can also use paint in neutral shades that match your color palette to create a wash for the wooden items.

Play wedding guest bingo.,
Play the shoe game.,
Host a couples quiz.,
Encourage love song karaoke.,
Provide mad lib forms for you guests to fill out.,
Ask guests to develop skits about you and your partner.,
Host a poetry reading.,
Create a word search napkin.",How to Choose Wedding Reception Activities1," Wedding guest bingo is a variety of bingo designed to get your wedding guests – especially those who might not know each other – talking and having a good time. If you want to create a wedding guest bingo sheet, you must have everyone reply to their wedding invitation with a fun fact about themselves. Place these facts onto a bingo card, with each fun fact consolidated into a few words contained within one square of a series (for instance, a bingo card with 16 squares, four squares arranged in four rows).Your guests can play the game by asking each other questions inspired by the criteria described in the bingo squares. For example, if one guest’s fun personal fact was that they were afraid of spiders, your guests might ask each other, “Are you afraid of spiders?”
When they find someone who matched the criteria they were looking for, they could place an “X” over that square. Whoever gets a full row or column of bingo squares filled with X’s first would win.
You can create more than one layout if you wish.;
, To play the shoe game, you and your new spouse sit back to back and each of you takes off your shoes. You’ll each trade one shoe to each other and hold your other shoe in your other hand. One guest will play the role of the emcee, and ask questions which compare the two of you. You and your partner answer by holding up the shoe of person who is the answer to the question, either you or your spouse.For instance, the emcee might ask, “Who is the better driver?” If you believe it’s you, you’d hold up your shoe. If you believe it’s your spouse, you’d hold up their shoe. Your spouse will do the same.
The game provides much comedy for your guests because you cannot see how your spouse answers but your guests can. If you and your spouse disagree on some things, it will be funny for your guests.
If you wanted, you could help your emcee craft a list of questions before playing the game, or encourage them to solicit questions from the other guests.

, You and your spouse – or a friend who makes a good emcee – can choose six guests to form two panels of three people. Each panel will be asked various questions about you and your spouse. If one team doesn’t know the answer to a question, it goes to the other team. The first panel to get 10 questions correct wins. Questions you might want to ask include:Where did my partner and I first meet?
Which of us said “I love you first”?
Where was our first vacation together?

, This wedding reception activity involves getting you and your spouse-to-be to kiss when you hear your guests sing a song containing the word love. Inform your guests after or during dinner that they can request a song of the DJ and if it contains the word “love,” you and your partner will kiss., Mad libs are short stories with certain words missing that the mad lib maker can select, usually for comedic effect. If you’re the creative type, you could print several of these mad lib sheets with content relating to your wedding or future married life and leave them on the table for your guests to fill out. Encourage your guests to read their mad libs after dinner.The wackier the mad lib content, the more laughs it will garner when read aloud.
For instance, one mad lib sentence might read, “and are really looking forward to when they visit .”
A wedding guest might use this mad lib example to write a zany sentence like “Jen and Edwin are really looking forward to skiing in Jamaica.”

, Your wedding guests know you and/or your partner intimately. If any among them are dramatic or creative types, you might be able to convince them to draft a short skit about you and your partner. Their lighthearted skit would provide plenty of laughs and smiles.A good skit should take some habit or style of interaction you and your partner engage in and exaggerate it for comedic effect.
Guests should prepare these skits ahead of time and then perform them during the reception.

, A poetry reading involves guests reading poetry – either their own or someone else’s – for the enjoyment of the assembled guests. Direct your guests to love poems and other wedding-appropriate poetry.For instance, you might suggest to interested guests to read something from John Donne, Shakespeare’s Sonnet 18, or “Love Explained” by Jennifer Michael Hecht.

, Instead of giving your guests plain old white napkins, order some customized napkins for the occasion. The napkins should have a series of letters arranged neatly in rows and columns. Some of these letters connect – going either up and down, left to right, or in a diagonal fashion – to make words. Your wedding guests should study the napkin carefully to identify what words are on the napkin.Choose words that are wedding-related. For instance, you might hide words like “love,” “wedding,” and “bride” amongst the jumble of other letters on the napkin.

Play a game of cornhole.,
Play horseshoes.,
Provide a croquet set.",How to Choose Wedding Reception Activities2," Cornhole is a great game in which you and a few wedding guests toss a series of beanbags toward a wooden board, the furthest edge of which is raised slightly and has a hole in it large enough to allow a beanbag to pass through it. Whoever gets the most beanbags through the hole at the end of five minutes wins.


If you or one of your friends is particularly creative, you could customize your cornhole board with wedding-related imagery like hearts, marriage rings, or some similar motif., Horseshoes is similar to cornhole. The game involves tossing horseshoes – usually three, four, or five – from one stake toward another. The stakes are usually about 5 yards apart. Your goal when playing against another person is to get more horseshoes than the other person around the stake. Once you and the other person toss your horseshoes toward one stake, walk over to it and toss them back towards the other stake you started from., Croquet is a game in which you and another player (or several other players) use a mallet to hit a ball through a series of wickets (small arches that stick up from the ground). Whoever can get their ball through all the wickets in the fewest number of strikes is the winner. It’s kind of like golf, but without the great distances involved between holes. If you’re hosting an outdoors wedding reception, croquet can be great fun for the whole gang."

Choose the right location.,
Make a list of wedding reception activities you enjoy.,
Draw up a budget.,
Develop a varied menu.,
Offer dancing opportunities.,
Offer kid-friendly activities.",How to Choose Wedding Reception Activities3," The right location will be one that can comfortably accommodate all your guests and pleases you and your spouse. Talk to your partner and exchange ideas about themes you might enjoy at your reception based on what the location is.For instance, if you want to have a wedding reception outside, you might want to find a public park or a local country club that rents space outdoors.
If you want a wedding reception in a rustic space, you could think about locating the wedding reception at the local nature center or mountain lodge.
Get to know the venue. The place you have your wedding reception might look great, but does it accommodate all the guests you’ll be hosting? Does the space have adequate acoustics? Visit a few times with your partner to figure out what the setup will look like the day of the wedding.
If possible, host your rehearsal dinner and bridal shower in the same place your wedding reception will be. This will give you an in-depth sense of what to expect from your wedding reception.

, If you’ve been to wedding receptions before, think back and identify fun activities that you might want to incorporate into your own wedding. If there were activities that you wished you’d been able to do at the prior wedding, write them on the list, too.Have your partner draft a similar list. Compare your lists to come up with some activities that you and your guests will enjoy.

, Hosting a wedding reception can be expensive. Be sure to add up the costs of not only the wedding reception activities, but also of the food and drinks, the DJ, and rental costs for the space. Be sure to tally up everything you want at your wedding reception and compare the total against the amount of cash you’re willing to spend on your wedding.If you find that you’re over budget, look for a more affordable alternative. For instance, if you think catering from the Tex-Mex restaurant is too much, get an order from the Italian place instead.

, You should have a mix of dishes so that everyone can enjoy the wedding reception meal. On your wedding invitations, you should provide options of space for guests to include dietary restrictions, allergies, or other special considerations. Take these requests and special needs into consideration when searching for caterers and venues.Try to include several vegan and vegetarian dishes.
Provide dishes that people with allergies – including nut, soy, and shellfish allergies – can enjoy.
Wedding guests will want to enjoy a full meal, not just one or two items from the menu. Be sure you accommodate your guests. For instance, if you know some guests have dairy allergies, include several dishes (including appetizers, main courses, and desserts) that are dairy-free, not just one or two items from the main course.

, Dancing is a fun way of moving the body to the rhythm of music. Your wedding reception could have ballroom dancing, tango dancing, disco dancing, or all of the above! Talk with your spouse and decide what sort of dancing you’d like to have at your wedding reception.If you have dancing, you’ll need music. Hire a DJ or a live band. A DJ is probably more affordable since you’ll be paying for the services of only one guy (versus the price of three or four guys in a band), but the personal touch of having a live band might be worth it to you.
Compare prices and think about what kind of reception you want.

, If your wedding guests are bringing children, you should provide a few activities for them, too. For instance, you might provide a coloring station with sheets of paper – either blank or with designs – and boxes of crayons. These activities will keep them from becoming bored and crabby, which might make them cause mischief.


Children also love playing videogames. Set up a videogame station where kids can play age-appropriate games together.
Children can also participate in some of the regular activities like cornhole and horseshoes.
If you’re worried about the kids becoming crabby, or if there are many children in attendance, you might have a separate room reserved for the kids. Set up all the kid-related activities in the separate room and hire a babysitter to watch them for the duration of the reception.

Give a gift to your boss for altruistic reasons only.,
Enlist the help of your co-workers.,
Be thoughtful.,
Don’t spend too much.,
Don’t get personal.,
Avoid giving gag gifts.,
Finished.

",How to Celebrate National Boss Day," It’s not wise to give your boss a gift only because you are expecting something in return, such as a raise or a promotion. The reason National Boss Day was created was in order for employees to show appreciation to their bosses.;
, Many employees band together and pitch in for a gift for boss’s day. It is an ideal way for everyone to show their appreciation without anyone feeling an economic crunch.

, The best gift to get is one that you want or like. Your boss will appreciate a gift that has obviously been chosen with some care. Think about what interests your boss. For example, a box of golf tees is a thoughtful gift for an avid golfer. Giving a gift that has no relevance at all to your boss will probably be viewed as insincere.

, Even if your salary is substantial, an expensive gift could be perceived the wrong way. Find a way to give something that is reasonably priced, no matter what your income.

, No matter how well you know your boss, or how long you have been with your company, there are boundaries. Avoid giving perfume, jewelry, clothing or personal items of any kind. Here are some suggestions:


Fountain pen
Flowers
Chocolates
Coffee or tea mug
Home baked cookies or canned preserves

, Gag gifts, which are often tasteless, are never a good idea. What you find hysterical may be offensive to your boss. Better to not take a chance.

Find a blank mask to decorate.,
Paint the mask, if desired.,
Decorate the mask.,
Decorate the dowel.,
Let the mask and dowel dry.,
Glue the dowel to the mask.",How to Make Mardi Gras Masks for Kids1," Half masks that cover just the eyes work the best, but you can use a full face mask if you can't find anything else. If you can't find any blank masks, find a mask template online, print it onto cardstock, then cut it out, including the eye holes., Most blank masks come in either black or white. If you want to make your mask look more interesting, paint it using purple, green, or yellow/gold paint. Acrylic or tempera paint will work just fine on paper or cardboard masks, but spray paint would be the better option for plastic masks.

If you like paper mache, consider covering the mask with glue and purple, green, and yellow tissue paper cut into 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) squares., The possibilities are endless here. Grab some glitter glue, rhinestones, feathers, sequins, and beads, and let your imagination run wild. Typical Mardi Gras colors are purple, green, and yellow/gold, but you can include other colors here as well. To cut back on drying times, use hot glue. Here are some decorating ideas to get you started:

Outline the eyes using glitter glue, sequins, tiny rhinestones, or Mardi Gras beads.
Add some colorful feathers to the top edge of the mask. Secure them by the stems to the back of the mask.
Decorate the mask with rhinestones and glitter glue.
Paint a harlequin design using purple, green, or yellow/gold paint.

, You don't have to do this, but it will give your mask a nice touch! Place a drop of hot glue at the bottom of you dowel, and press the end of a thin ribbon into it. Wrap the ribbon around the dowel in a spiral, then secure the other end to the top of the dowel with more hot glue. Glue a small, round rhinestone to each end of the dowel.

If you can't find a dowel, a chop stick may also work.
Stick-on rhinestones are the perfect size for this. You will still want to glue them on, however.
If you can't find rhinestones, that's okay! You can leave them out, or use glitter glue instead!

, How long the mask takes to dry depends on what you used to decorate it. Hot glue sets in seconds, and acrylic paint dries in less than an hour. Regular craft glue and glitter glue can take several hours! Be patient., Flip the mask over so that the back is facing you. Place the dowel along one of the edges. Make sure that the rhinestone tip is just peeking out over the top edge of the mask. Secure the dowel with some hot glue."

Decorate the mask.,
Attach the mask to a straw or short dowel.",How to Make Mardi Gras Masks for Kids2," Great choices include poster paper and cardstock. They can be both the same color or different colors, such as purple and green. In a pinch, you could also use construction paper as well., Use a large paint brush or foam brush to paint the paper a solid color. You don't really need to do this, since you will be decorating the mask later on, but it's a great additional step to keep young crafters entertained!

You can paint the mask any color you want, but purple, green, and yellow/gold are traditional Mardi Gras colors.

, You will need to trace both your left hand and you right hand. Be sure to spread your hands and fingers apart, like showing someone the number 5., Be sure to cut neatly between the fingers. If a young crafter is doing this project, it would be best if an adult or older child helped them with this step!, Place the hands side-by-side so that the bases of the palms are touching and the fingers are pointing to the sides. Overlap the palms by 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters), then secure them with a strip of clear tape. You can also use glue instead.A staple is not recommended because of how close it is to the eyes.

, Place the mask over your face with the thumbs pointing down. Gently feel where the eyes are, and make a mark with a pencil. Use the pencil marks as a guide to draw almond shapes, then cut the shapes out.Young crafters will need adult help on this step.

, Let your imagination run wild. You can paint the mask or draw on it with glitter glue. You can add rhinestones, beads, or feathers. Be sure to decorate the area around the eyeholes to make them stand out!Be sure to let the mask dry once you decorate it. How long it takes depends on what you used to decorate it.
Don't get too carried away. If the mask is too heavy, it will flop down!

, Flip the mask over so that the back is facing you and the thumbs are pointing down. Place your stick on the side of the mask so that it is parallel to the base of the fingers. Secure the stick with some tape or hot glue.You can also use a chopstick instead.
Decorate the stick with ribbon and/or rhinestones first for an extra-fancy mask.

, Find the middle of the mask. Next, cut a U-shaped groove into the bottom straight edge. How big you cut the groove depends on how big your nose bridge is. You want the mask to be able to rest on your nose.If you want a cat eye mask instead, cut a U-shaped groove into the top, curved edge instead

, Place the mask over your face, like a pair of sunglasses. Gently feel where your eyes are, then make marks using a pencil. Sketch out a pair of almond-shaped eye holes with a pencil right over the marks. Cut the eye holes out.If a young crafter is making this mask, he or she will need and adult to help them with this step.
For a more precise cut, use a craft blade.

, You can apply the paint using a large paintbrush or a foam brush. Make sure that you coat the entire mask with paint. You can make your mask any color you want, but purple, green, and yellow/gold are traditional Mardi Gras colors. Let the paint dry before moving on.This step can get a little messy. It would be a good idea to work on top of some newspaper.

, Let your imagination go wild here. The fancier your mask is, the better. Try some glitter glue, sequins, rhinestones, and feathers.

If the wreath is very large, several strips may be needed but one strip should suffice for a small wreath.
, If you need to make joins, overlap the fabric neatly and glue in place. Glue the end piece in place. When gluing, keep the fabric as flat as possible, to avoid making lumps., Again, glue any joins neatly in place and glue the end piece off neatly. Any joins and the end piece should be at the back of the wreath, so as to not show when on display., Leave gaps of about 5cm/2 inches between each following wrap; there should be plenty of the underlying organza and lamé fabrics showing through, as the ribbon is simply a decorative addition. As you wrap, glue the ribbon in place., Make a 4 to 6 loop bow, so that it appears voluminous. Tie in the middle with some of the small ribbon.

Learn how to forgive and forget.",How to Make the Most out of Ramadhan," Keep a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and exercise regularly. Start each day with a complex carbohydrate breakfast that breaks down slowly, allowing you to stay energized through the day. Have a light meal at the end of each day: focus on fruit, vegetables, live-culture yogurt, and salad.


Drink plenty of water, and avoid dehydrating substances. Try to stay away from diuretics like coffee and tea.
Rid yourself of distraction, and stifle the urge to eat when you're bored. Try to be mindful and methodical about what you eat.;
, Prepare yourself spiritually by fasting on Mondays, Thursdays, and the 13th, 14th, and 15th of the lunar calendar in Shaa'baan.Wake up earlier than usual to pray – even half an hour before Fajr will do. Read the Qur'an after Fajr, even if you only do so for 10-15 minutes.Stock up on interesting lectures related to spirituality, discipline, and Islam. Listen to these lectures during the day or on your way to work. The more time you spend thinking about your faith, the more likely your thoughts will be to return to this theme when you have an idle moment.
Consider performing the Dhikr prayer or other devotional acts when you're cooking, waiting in line, or have some free time. This is predominantly a Sufi tradition, but this sort of repetition can help you focus your thoughts on Allah regardless of your background., Minimize distractions, and try to foster mental clarity. Focus your thoughts on helping others and improving yourself. Spend your free time studying, creating, or quietly reflecting. Wean yourself off of television and other distracting media, and consider reading a spiritual book instead to connect with your faith., Organize your life, and prepare yourself to make the most out of a thoughtful and disciplined month. Do what you need to do to stay on top of everything during Ramadhan. You may find it easier to keep to a rigorous schedule of prayer, meals, and religious ceremonies if you've cultivated a disciplined lifestyle beforehand.


Put your affairs in order. Take care of anything serious that you need to do before Ramadhan begins. You may be able to focus more intently on spiritual growth if you don't need to worry about practical difficulties.
Shop for groceries in advance. It might be a chore to shop when you're hungry. Prepare large batches of food and freeze them; chop vegetables and store them in airtight containers.

, Think about what you'd like to change in your life: perhaps you need to cut out poor habits, or improve your discipline, or align your actions with your ideals. Consider what you can do to become a happier and more effective human being. Ramadhan is a prime opportunity to your reflect on your life and reset your routines – so plan ahead to make the best use of your time., Each day, wake up during Fajr (the dawn prayer) to eat the pre-dawn meal (Sahur). If you prefer, you can stay up late and eat Sahur before you go to sleep. Stay up to read a portion of the Qur'an before and after Fajr.Make sure to keep up a disciplined prayer schedule, and try to structure your day-to-day thoughts around holy things. Abstain from eating, drinking, smoking, and sex from dawn until dusk until the end of Ramadhan. Once the sun goes down, take iftar (the fast-breaking evening meal) with friends and family, and talk about what you have learned today.


Look up daily prayer times for your area at: https://www.islamicfinder.org/world/. The prayer times are dictated by the rising and the setting of the sun. If you live in a predominantly Muslim area, you may be reminded by prayer bells to take each prayer of the day.
Make arrangements to give Zakaat al-Fitr on time. This can be done anytime before the 'Eid prayer.

, Fasting can throw off your normal eating and sleeping schedule, and you may need to get more sleep than usual in order to stay strong. Many people stay up late at night, then nap in the afternoon to stave off the hunger. Try to take naps midway through the day – even a half-hour power nap will leave you feeling refreshed.

, Generosity is a central theme to the ethos of Ramadhan, and you can practice this community spirit in every single interaction with another person. You don't need to donate money: you can brighten someone's day with a smile or a few kind words. You can even give back to others simply by being patient and kind. Take this month as an opportunity to be the best sort of person that you can be.


Give your money. Try tipping service workers as an act of good faith; consider giving money or food to a homeless person.
Volunteer your time. Serve food to the homeless, or restore a damaged ecosystem, or pick up trash in your neighborhood. Be generous with your time, and you may find it rewarding.
Be a positive force. Be patient and kind, as much as possible, and try to brighten the days of the people you meet. Try to keep an optimistic, upbeat attitude about everything that you do.

, Certain groups of people are exempted from fasting during Ramadhan: travelers, and sick people whose illness can be made worse by fasting; menstruating women and women with post-partum bleeding; pregnant and nursing women; and people who are not physically capable of fasting, either due to old age or incurable diseases. If you fall into one of these categories, you can still practice physical and spiritual discipline. Find a practice that nourishes your soul.


For people who cannot fast long-term (e.g. incurable disease or old age), you must provide Fidyah, which is payment that makes up for your inability to fast.Try volunteering or doing something selfless for others. As long as your intentions are pure, you should be able to find a solid alternative.

, You aren't allowed to drink anything from dawn until dusk – so make sure that you drink plenty of water between iftar and Sahoor. Try having at least two glasses of water at each meal. Avoid drinks that dehydrate you such as coffee and soda. Instead, opt for herbal teas or unsweetened juices.

, Throughout the month of Ramadhan, make an effort to attend and organize community iftars and taraweeh.Be inclusive, and try to invite people who often get overlooked. Focus on connecting deeply and finding common ground with others in the community; don't think of it as ""networking"". Share the Ramadhan experience with your community in order to make all of your generosity and reflection more valuable.


Greet Arab-speaking Muslims with a traditional Ramadhan greeting. ""Ramadhan Kareem,"" ""Ramadhan Mubarak,"" or ""Kul 'am wa enta bi-khair!"" Respectively, these phrases mean, ""Generous Ramadhan,"" ""Blessed Ramadhan,"" and ""May every year find you in good health!"", It can be tempting to eat a lot of food at sundown when you haven't eaten all day – but it is best to break a fast slowly. Start with dates and a hydrating drink: water, juice, milk, a soup, or a smoothie. Go at it slowly, and eat sparingly of the spread. Save your main meal for later in the night. If you're cooking iftar, bake and broil instead of frying for a healthier meal.

, It's easy to get overwhelmed by life and forget that this month is essentially about renewing one's personal connection with God. The Qur'an says (translated): ""When you are free from your affairs, then turn to your Lord."" Wake up in the night and pray as much as you can. Consider staying in seclusion (i'tikaf) for a part of the month, even if you only take a weekend away., This is said to be the holiest day of the holiest month. In the Qur'an, it is written that the Night of Power is better than a thousand months, by virtue of the blessings that descend in it. Seek this night, and spend it religiously: perform voluntary prayers, read the Qur'an, and supplicate. This night can be a turning point of your Ramadhan experience., Ramadhan presents a great opportunity to fill your life with discipline and meaning. The best way to make the most out of Ramadhan is to carry the lessons learned you've learn—e.g. moderation and discipline—into the year that follows. Maintain the healthy habits that you have built. Try not to slip into your old ways., You've been fasting for an entire month, and your body may not be used to heavy portions. Start moderately – this goes for fatty or fried foods, salt, and sugar. Your stomach may have shrunk with reduced consumption, and you don't want to bloat yourself. If you eat too much, take it as a lesson to slow down next time.


Consider whether it's worth resuming a habit of heavy consumption. If you've been able to cultivate a healthier lifestyle during Ramadhan, try to keep it that way.
To avoid heartburn, line your stomach with a bland, alkaline foodstuff before starting into spicy, fried foods.

, You may have made positive changes in your life during Ramadhan, but this does not mean that they're permanent. Nothing is permanent unless you continually, mindfully make it so. Find a way to hold yourself accountable: try keeping a journal of your personal and spiritual development, and consider finding a person to whom you can talk about your progress., Let go of the negative feelings that hold you back. Don`t hold grudges against people who have wronged you in the past. Do this for your own sake. If you keep those bad feelings inside, they might hurt you in the future – not only psychologically, but physically.

Discuss the meaning of the holiday.,
Talk about holiday memories.,
Read holiday books.,
Watch holiday movies.",How to Make the Holidays Meaningful for Your Kids1," Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa, you and your family can learn the meaning of the holiday. Read the origin story about the holiday or research where certain traditions come from.As you learn about the holiday, talk about it with your kids. Ask them questions and make sure they understand what they are learning.;
, Another way to make the holidays meaningful is to share holiday memories with each other. Ask your children what their favorite memories are and why. Share with them stories about past holidays. Make sure to include stories about family members they may not have met so they will know about their ancestors.If family members are no longer with you, spend time sharing memories about those you love. That keeps them with you and your family.
You may tell the same stories each year, but that’s okay. Sharing holiday stories each year is a great tradition.

, As the holidays get closer, you can get together with your kids or as a family and read holiday books. You can choose a new book or story each night, or read one every few nights.If you want to read a longer novel, get together and read a few chapters each night.

, There are lots of great kid-friendly holiday movies that you can enjoy with your kids. Try sitting down as a family to watch a movie once per week in the weeks leading up to the holidays.

Try introducing your kids to some of you favorite holiday movies, or watch holiday classics with them, such as Charlie Brown Christmas, Frosty the Snowman, and Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas."
"
Say, “no.” If you feel overwhelmed by events, errands, and requests, practice saying “no.” If your child wants to spend a whole weekend doing an activity yet your family does not have time, find an alternative activity.,
Attend only some events.,
Limit your travel.,
Ask for help.,
Simplify your decor.,
Skip the Christmas cards.,
Get ahead when you can.,
Involve your children.,
Make time for meaningful activities.,
Make time for self-care.,
Spend what you can afford.,
Avoid stressful shopping.,
Keep things in perspective.",How to Make the Holidays Less Stressful As a Parent," If your extended family is coming from out of town and wants to stay at your house, suggest a local hotel or bed and breakfast. Think about your limits and what you and your family can realistically handle. If you feel like a request is too much for you to handle, say no.Saying no doesn’t mean you’re being rude, it means you’re observing your boundaries and limits. Try saying, “I can’t come through for you on that, I’m sorry.”
Remember that “no” is a complete response and you don't have to explain further or defend yourself. Practice saying no kindly, but without too much explanation. Some examples might be, ""No, I can't do that;"" ""Thank you for asking, but I can't;"" ""No, I have to pass on that;"" ""I appreciate the invitation but I'm already committed."";
, Between Christmas programs and holiday recitals and office parties mixed in with birthdays and other gatherings, you may feel stretched thin in your time. Set some limits on what events you can and cannot attend. You may decide to accept some invitations and not others. When invited to a party, take some time to decide on whether you can go or whether you should pass. Don't forget to thank the person who invited you.Prioritize your children’s recitals and programs and go from there.
Before the holiday season begins, think about how many social arrangements you can handle. You may decide to attend four parties, accept the first four invitations, then decline any others.
You may decide to take turns attending an event. You may attend one friend's annual New Year's party this year, and commit to a different friend's party the next year.
If you can't make an event, you may want to send a note saying thank you for the invitation, or even a small gift.

, Especially if you have a newborn or are tight on money, you may need to reconsider that 10-hour van ride across the country to see your family. Even if your extended family is disappointed, let them know that it’s not a possibility this year and you need to spend the holidays at home. You may wish to say that it’s not personal, only practical.For example, say, “Our family is feeling really frazzled this year and won’t make it to the family holiday gathering this year. We’re sad and the kids are disappointed but it looks like financially and time-wise it’s not an option this year. I’m sorry.”
Consider hosting a family holiday party at your house if it’s difficult for your family to travel. Then, when your children are older and better able to travel, you can let someone else host.

, To lower stress and increase cooperation, ask for help. Kids can feel included and useful when you ask for their help in the kitchen or in tidying the house. Reach out to family members to help set up meals or activities for the kids. Trade babysitting with another family so that you can enjoy some kid-free time. If you have a need, ask someone to help you.For example, say to other parents, “I know both of our families are really busy, why don’t we take turns watching each other’s kids?”
If you’re asking your own children for help, say, “We need help with the family meal tonight. Ana, would you set the table? Chris, could you help me finish up the meal?”
You might also consider outsourcing some of the work or hiring a housekeeper or cleaning company temporarily. You might do your grocery shopping online and pick them up at the store or have them delivered to your house to save you a trip.

, Many people love the holidays and decorate their homes to reflect the holiday spirit. If this feels overwhelming to you, skip the decorations this year. If you must decorate, use simple, easy-to-reuse decorations such as an artificial tree with pre-strung lights or a wreath that you can reuse year after year. Instead of going all-out on outdoor decorations, focus your attention inside or keep your outdoor decorations simple and stress-free.For example, instead of stringing lights around your house, put up a wreath or a tasteful lawn decoration.
Get the kids to help out and do what they can, then come to finish the job.

, If sending out a yearly newsletter or card adds to your stress, consider skipping it this year. Getting the family together for a photo, writing about each family member, then printing and mailing each card out may take too much time and effort that you don’t have this year. Remove yourself from feeling guilty and take a pass.Consider an e-card or a very simple, postcard-like card that requires little effort.
If you must send cards, get your kids involved in addressing and stamping the envelopes.

, When you find yourself with some time, you may be able to do a little extra work to save yourself time when you are feeling swamped later. For instance, you could make some meals in advance and freeze them for easy preparation. You may even be able to pay your bills a month ahead of time so you don't even have to think about them when things get crazy.


If you usually wait to wrap presents all at once, you might try committing to wrapping one present a day in the weeks leading up to the holiday.

, Get kids involved in the spirit of the holidays by asking them to participate. Whether they help to put up the ornaments on the tree or make cookies for the cookie exchange, they can have fun and be involved. Give each child a task to complete such as putting up the wreath, setting the table, or lighting the candles.Ask your children what ways they can think of to give back to others and ask them to take the initiative.

, Don’t get lost in details and obligations. Find time to spend with your family, enjoying one another and having fun. Make time for fun events and things that put the family in a good mood. Do silly things like playing games or seeing who can fall the most while ice skating. Find moments when your family connects through good times and happy experiences.See if your family members (adults included) are willing to put their phones and other electronics aside for awhile (unless it's to take pictures!).
Add a dash of silliness when your kids are starting to look bored. Create a game or a contest for your kids like who can wish the most people a “Merry Christmas” or “Happy Holidays.”

, Set aside some time each day for yourself or for activities that make you feel relaxed. Instead of vegging out with television, invite the family to take a walk together. Get up a few minutes early each day for silent meditation or yoga. Do activities that help you cope with stress and feel good.Finding time in the morning or after the kids go to bed can be an ideal time for self-care. Using this time can minimize distractions and help you focus on giving back to yourself.
Make self-care a priority. You may be tempted to let your self-care lapse so you can fit in more activities and events, but remember that it's okay to say ""no"" to a party so you can stay home and take a long bath and unwind.
You may have to sacrifice some of your usual self-care rituals during the busy holidays, but make sure you don't forget them completely. Put one or two things on your schedule and stick to it.

, Prior to buying gifts, decide on a budget. Figure out how much you will spend on each family member and stick to it. You may want to try to pick out gifts early and buy them well in advance so that expenses don't pile up all at once. Remember that kids don’t need expensive gifts to enjoy the holidays. Having lots and lots of toys won’t make your child any happier, so give yourself a break if you can’t afford to give them everything they want. Your child will likely be happy to receive gifts, even if their pile is small.Your child’s experience of the holiday season does not depend on how many gifts they receive. Make the holiday season special by the experiences you have as a family, not by the amount of gifts received.

, Don’t wait until the last minute to buy gifts. Utilize tools such as online shopping to avoid lines at the stores, parking and general hassles and hold-ups. If you’re buying for many people (especially adults or many children), don’t be afraid to buy multiples of things.A little planning ahead with gifts can save you some stress the nearer you come to the holidays.


Take advantage of gift wrapping options. Many stores offer free gift wrapping. If the line is short and it’s not a hassle, do it and get one more thing off your list.

, If you start to feel frazzled and overwhelmed around the holidays, keep it in perspective. The holiday season is relatively short. Even if you dread the long car ride with your kids to go to their grandparents or the financial strain that comes with the holidays, know that there will be time to recover from the trip afterward. Once the holidays are over there will be plenty of time for tasks you overlooked or things that need to get done or do some personal recuperation.If you start to feel overwhelmed, take a deep breath. Try stepping outside or going for a walk or a short drive. Know that you will get through the holidays in one piece.

Create traditions.,
Decorate together.,
Create an activity advent calendar.,
Have a present wrapping party.,
Plan a holiday outing.,
Organize a family holiday night at home.",How to Make the Holidays Meaningful for Your Kids2," Holidays are centered around traditions, and your family may have some special cultural traditions as well. Ask your children what their favorite traditions are and continue to do that. Continue traditions from your childhood with your children. Explain to them what it was like when you were a kid at the holidays and why your family did those traditions. If your family has no traditions, make new ones.Think about the traditions that your family has and ask a grandparent or other older relative about the origins of those traditions. You can also ask grandparents and great grandparents about what their traditions were growing up and what traditions are special to them.
You can create traditions around anything. You may always get together and make the same baked goods, listen to the same holiday album while decorating, or go to the same place together.

, Make decorating an experience for your entire family. Go together to a tree farm to get a Christmas tree then go home and decorate it. Have everyone go outside and put up lights in the yard. Get your kids to help place decorations around your home.If you family does not celebrate Christmas, then decorate for the holidays you do celebrate, whether it is Hanukah, Kwanzaa, or Yule.
Encourage your kids to suggest themes for decorations. Give each of them a surface or a room to decorate in their theme.

, Advent calendars are countdowns to Christmas (or to the holiday that your family celebrates) that are usually filled with a piece of candy for each day. Instead of candy, make the countdown meaningful with an activity for each day leading up to it.For example, if you celebrate Christian Christmas, you can read a scripture some of the days leading to Christmas. Other ideas are doing something kind in the spirit of the holidays, baking something together, or creating a holiday craft together.
Come up with a set number of activities for the days leading up to the holiday. You can do seven, 10, or even 24.

, Even the smallest thing can be a meaningful experience for kids. Turn on music or a holiday movie, get some cookies and hot chocolate, and pile in the floor to wrap gifts.Let your kids wrap presents, put the tape on the paper, or place bows.

, The holidays can be a busy time, so taking the time to plan a special outing with your family can be a great way to make the holidays meaningful. Take your kids to see Santa, go look at a local lights display, or go see a holiday play or ballet. Make it a joint effort and let everyone have a say in what you do.You can make it a tradition where you do one special thing each year. You can rotate and let different family members choose the outing each year.

, Going out is fun during the holidays, but staying home can be just as fun. Buy your family holiday pajamas, socks, shirts, or hats, turn on Christmas music or movies, and do something festive. It may be baking, writing holiday cards, making gingerbread houses, or playing games.You can have multiple days like this at home with your kids. If you have multiple kids, let them each have a night where they choose what to do.

Consider changing the way you give presents.,
Volunteer.,
Give back in some way together.",How to Make the Holidays Meaningful for Your Kids3," If you think your kids are too focused on gifts and the materialistic side of the holidays, then you may want to give gifts in a different way. You can set a limit on how many gifts your kids get each. You can outline these expectations at the beginning of the holiday season so they are aware of the limited gifts.Focus more on doing things together and making memories than on gifts. Don’t make shopping part of the family traditions. Instead, focus on being together.
Make homemade gifts with your family. This could be picture frames, art projects, or other crafts.
If your kids are old enough, talk to them about marketing and the capitalistic way companies use the holidays. Discuss the idea of getting too many presents or things we don’t need.

, Another way to help make the holidays meaningful is to help your kids volunteer in some way. Giving back to the community can help your children spread the spirit of the holidays.You and your kids can volunteer at soup kitchens to serve dinner for those less fortunate.
Get creative and make cards for local nursing homes or homeless shelters. You can also make cards to send overseas to those in the military.
Organize a visit to a nursing home or senior center. Your children can sing Christmas carols, give out cards, or help decorate.
Get your kids to go through their toys and fill a box of things they don’t want anymore to give to a local organization that helps those less fortunate.

, The holidays are a great time to help others. Ask your child to choose an organization or cause to donate to. This might be donating toys, clothes, or food to local donation drives. You might adopt a family to provide a Christmas for the children. As you do this together, make sure to talk about why you are doing it and the importance of giving back to the community.Some organizations allow you to donate money or gifts for families in other countries. If your child loves animals, you can donate to animal shelters or animal organizations.
You can encourage your child to drop money in donation buckets outside stores that you pass.

Light colored cotton shirts tend to ""breathe"" better than other fabric, such as polyester, and thus creates a better blood flow.;
, Even if you are on a walk around the neighborhood, the sun rays always impact your skin. Be sure to apply SPF 15 sunscreen prior to going outside. Waterproof sunscreen helps when going in the pool or ocean.

, Knowing how low or high the UV rays for the day before going out is important. The higher the level, the higher the risk of health problems and skin cancer.

, People do get sunburned on their scalp, foreheads, and the back of the neck. Keep yourself covered and safe with them.

, Every type of footwear is acceptable in different places and activities. For the great outdoors, it's always good to have a flexible, closed-toe pair of sneakers or hiking boots.

, Make sure you have a water bottle or a sports drink with electrolytes handy. Avoid drinking when you're thirsty, but use it as a motivation to consume non-caffeinated drinks.

Beaches
Short hikes with minimum ascending
Fishing or boating trips

, Allow yourself to become familiarized with any maps of the trails, how high a trail goes on a hill or mountain, what are the best times of the day, etc.

, Before the temperatures rise even more in July, take this chance to settle yourself outside for a few days. Camping is one of the best ways to interact with nature and spend quality time in the great outdoors.

, Take advantage of any free-waiver or free admission days in June to see the natural beauty of your state.

, This is a great way for not only family, but friends as well, to get together outdoors. Always be sure to use disposable plates and utensils, even for a backyard barbecue, so that cleanups are easy to handle.

, Many vegetables are well suited to be planted in the Spring, depending on the climate. Make this a family activity, so that kids can enjoy eating what they have grown over the summer.

, Bring an extra plastic or trash bag for a trash disposal. Never litter or toss trash on the side of the road. Keep the bag with you as you leave and dispose it properly.

, If you are at a campsite and used a burner or concrete grill, make sure it's clean for the next person to enjoy. Cover up any tent nail indentations in the dirt when packing things up.

, While you are hiking, it may be enjoyable to collect nature along the way. Take pictures of everything instead and enjoy the memories.

, Never use shortcuts, as you may hurt the wildlife and area by breaking branches or stepping on grass or flowers that may have an imprint for quite some time.

, If you're wanting to make a campfire, never break branches from trees, but try to find dead branches from the ground.

A small table is probably best, so that you don't have too much area to cover. A little tea table or a stand would be a good choice.;
, To do this:


Use the template shown in this article.
Cut out the pieces and the slit and attach together by inserting at the slit line.
Make more as needed until you have enough. Set aside until the other major pieces have been placed.

, Use ice-blue paper. Cut a lake shape from the paper, then tape down onto the green paper on the table.

, Place the houses and trees at the edges of the lake. Introduce other elements to bring the scene to life, such as model people, toy cars, model animals, etc.

, Apply silver or white glitter to the houses and trees and around the scene. You may wish to put some on the lake too.

, If the table is under something you can use for hanging thread from, have Santa in his sleigh hanging above the scene. Or, have him already in the scene––perhaps he's just landed.

Delegate or drop tasks you don’t want.,
Alternate childcare with a friend.",How to Make Time for Yourself During the Holidays1," Maybe you’re one of those people who drags out of bed after hitting the snooze button four times. Setting an intention to take 30 minutes to an hour for yourself when you rise can be just the motivation you need to roll out of bed at the first sound of the alarm.


To ensure that you actually get out of bed, choose an activity that you find rewarding or rejuvenating. Make it anything you want. Consider doing yoga, meditating, making a nice wholesome breakfast, or turning on your DVR to watch the episode you missed of your favorite TV show. Using morning time for something like exercise, practicing gratitude, or affirmation journaling can also set the tone for a positive day.
If waking up early is a chore, aim to get up 15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your goal time. Increase your chances of being successful by getting in bed 15 minutes earlier, too. Doing this not only gives you time to yourself, but you will also feel nourished and in a better mood to go about your daily activities.;
, If you are bogged down running errands or attending events, opt to drive solo. While this doesn’t change your schedule, it does give you several minutes to catch your breath before reentering a demanding social situation.


Turn on the radio full blast. Refresh your lipstick or hairstyle. Pray. Take deep breaths. Do whatever you need to do to revive and recollect yourself as you move between stressful holiday activities.

, Do you find yourself complaining each week because you never seem to have any time to do things you want to do? Plan them. During the busy holiday season, you can’t expect a window of free-time to magically open up. You have to make it.Pencil a candlelight dinner with your partner, a movie night, or a massage into your calendar at the start of the week. Don’t get into the habit of pushing these back because then you will never end up doing them. Make these activities priorities in your schedule.

, Giving in to other's demands can lead to you having no room in your schedule for yourself. Start carefully evaluating what you say ""yes"" to in order to make more time for you.


If other people’s demands start to encroach on your me-time, say “I’m so sorry, but my calendar is all booked up for the week. Next time, can you give me advanced notice?”
If saying no makes you uncomfortable, have a friend practice with you so that you can become more comfortable with saying no in various ways, even when pushed.

, Getting more time for yourself during the holidays could be a matter of simplifying. Is your daily and weekly calendar filled to capacity with various obligations that bring little joy or meaning to your life? It may be time to reevaluate.


Look at your planner or calendar and jot down all the obligations you have in a week beyond the necessities like work or school. Go through each activity and consider if it’s something you truly enjoy doing. If not, see if you can pass it off to a friend, family member, or coworker—or, completely get rid of it altogether.Keep in mind that sometimes you have to let go of certain activities if the stress of doing them outweighs the benefit.

, If you have children, then you might consider doing a childcare swap with a friend. Arrange to watch her children one day or afternoon and then let her do the same for you. This will provide each of you with some additional time for self-care."
"
Pursue a hobby.,
Create a self-care box.,
Take a nap.,
Practice gratitude.",How to Make Time for Yourself During the Holidays2," Once you have cleared time in your schedule for me-time, you need to decide how to spend it. One fulfilling way to make the most of any free time you get is to engage in your interests. Even if you only have 30 minutes to dedicate to it, having a hobby helps you manage stress, offers an opportunity to make new friends, and adds a layer of intrigue and meaning to your life.Start back doing something you stopped like sewing, playing soccer, baking, or bird-watching. Your hobby can be virtually any activity that brings you joy.
If time for yourself doesn’t necessarily translate to time alone for you, invite a friend or partner to join you. The two of you can strengthen your bond and relax during this stressful time of year.
You might also consider finding an accountability partner to encourage you. You will be more likely to engage in an activity if you have someone counting on you.

, Being prepared for leisure time means you won’t spend your precious moments searching around for what you need to relax. Depending on your preferences, fill a box or bag with all the essentials you need to unwind. Keep the box in the same place, and the items fully stocked, to save time.


If loved ones are asking for gift ideas for you, think of things they might be able to add to your self-care box.
Think of your self-care box as a first aid kit for your mental wellness.Include various items for rest and relaxation such as bath salts or bombs, tea, chocolate, headphones, a journal, a coloring book, or a spine-tingling novel.

, Another way to spend your special time is by taking a quick power nap. The holiday season can lead to nights up catching up on work before the break or early mornings making Christmas crafts with the kids. If you’re experiencing an afternoon slump, consider getting some shut-eye to reenergize.


Naps are actually good for you. Taking a 20-minute nap can boost alertness, lift your mood, and reduce tension., Spending a few minutes recognizing all that you’re grateful for in your life is a wonderful practice to cultivate during the holidays. Expressing gratitude improves your own well-being and that of the people you express it to.


Spend your me-time writing special notes on holiday cards to thank all the people who make you life full such as friends, coworkers, neighbors, and relatives.
You might also spend a few minutes each day writing in a gratitude journal. Jot down 3 to 5 things that you are thankful for."

Do this regularly to ward off anxiety. You can even practice deep breathing when you don't feel anxious.


Breathing deeply kicks on the body’s natural stress response, helping you slow your heart rate and ease tension. Try breathing in through your nose for about 4 counts. Hold the breath. Then, release the breath from your mouth slowly for 8 counts. Repeat as needed.

, If worries are making the holidays less than merry for you, take a meditation break. People are often intimidated by meditation, but it’s a very simple technique with amazing benefits. Fight illness, eliminate negative thoughts and emotions, improve self-awareness, and reduce stress—all while taking a moment to sit in silence.One practical method is mantra meditation. Sit comfortably in a quiet place. Close your eyes. Select a phrase, such as “I am the picture of calm” and repeat it over and over in your mind. Take deep, cleansing breaths. When distracting thoughts enter your mind, don’t judge yourself. Simply let them come and go as you repeat your mantra and breathe gently. Try this exercise for about 10 minutes and add more time as you get accustomed to the practice.
You can also look into local meditation classes to help you destress.

, The holiday season is colder, which can make it less likely that you want to lace up those running shoes. However, getting exercise should be a priority during this time of year, and always. Do something good for yourself by stealing away just 30 minutes on most days of the week for physical activity.


Exercise can be done alone or in a group. And, it doesn’t have to be limited to gym activities. Go for a hike. Take the kids sledding. Go window shopping with your best pal., Your holiday schedule may be filled to the brim, but a quick and easy way to take time for yourself is by ensuring that you eat a solid breakfast each day. When you’re busy or stressed, you’re more likely to reach for convenience foods that aren’t good for the body. Or, you might skip breakfast altogether.


Prep your meals the night before as you are getting ready for bed. Set aside filling and healthy options such as toast and peanut butter, fruit and yogurt, or oatmeal. Try to eat at home, so you know you’re making healthy choices., Be sure not to overindulge on alcohol over the holidays. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant and it can make you feel depressed if you drink too much of it for long periods of time. Opt for non-alcoholic drinks most days and if you do drink, keep it to one or two drinks maximum."

, Don't fall into the habit of limiting your wardrobe to white, black, grey, and navy blue for the winter! Colour and the colours we wear have a big effect on our moods. It may be dark and dreary outside, but that doesn't mean your wardrobe and mood have to match!

, Take a bath, apply lotion, shave. Guys, this goes for you too! Your winter will be much better if you treat your body the way you would in the summer, when you're showing off more skin.

Find a suitable container.,
Find suitable foods for each compartment, according to their symbolism.,
Add a piece of tissue or rice paper over the top of the compartments if giving a gift box.,
Serve.",How to Make a Tray of Togetherness," The container should be shaped as a circle or an octagon. A flower variation of the octagon is acceptable. Any containers with slightly raised sides that can be divided into eight equal portions is ideal, such as a large shallow bowl or a round tray or platter. Platters that are already divided in this manner can be purchased from Asian gift or grocery stores and are usually made from ceramic, rosewood, glass or plastic.


If giving as a gift, the best container is one with a lid so that the goodies don't tip out. This container must have separate compartments inside, preferably eight because this represents the Eight Immortals. A good place to look for such a container is in an Asian grocery store.
A container with a lid is also useful for keeping the treats fresh overnight and for keeping away insects.;
, For example:


Lychee nuts: for close family relationships
Red melon seeds: for happiness, truth and joy
Peanuts: for a long and happy life
Candied melon: for growth and health
Coconut, fresh or dried: for unity and friendship
Lotus seeds: for fertility
Longan: for many good sons
Kumquat: for prosperity
Other suitable sweets with appropriate meanings that bode well for the future.

, Then close the lid.

, If preparing for your own home, place the tray of togetherness out for guests to enjoy at will.


Keep refilling the tray during the period of Chinese New Year celebrations.

, You can do an Internet search for Day of the Dead masks, calavera template or calaca template.

,, Print it out to use as your pattern.

, You can simply cut around the perimeter or your can cut out the eye, nose and other decorations, so that you can trace them directly onto the paper plate.

, Flip it over, so that the back side of the plate is the front side of the mask.

,, If you are using a thin paper plate, you can cut out the mask and eye holes with scissors, and if you are using a thick paper plate, you may want to use an Exacto knife. Your skeleton mask should begin to take shape.

, You can use differently colored paints, permanent markers, colored pencils or crayons. You can choose to have a black and white palette, to further imitate a skeleton, or you can choose to decorate it with bright colors.

Pick a four hour time window.,
Send out invitations.,
Create the holiday mood.,
Include kid-friendly activities.,
Make lists for everything.",How to Host a Healthy Holiday Open House1," The beauty of an open house is that it’s a great way to entertain without having to stress about all the details that come with a cocktail party or formal dinner. Just pick a block of time on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon or evening, like from 2 to 6 p.m. or from 4 to 8. When you invite your guests, you’ll note that it’s an open house, so they can come and go as they please with no expectation to stay the entire time.Open houses are a great choice if you’re not thrilled at the prospect of having dozens of people crammed into your home all at once!
The casual schedule is also perfect for families with kids. They don’t require parents to book a sitter, they’re typically a kid-friendly form of entertainment, and families can get back home before it gets too late.;
, When you’ve chosen a date and time, send out paper invitations or use social media to invite your guests. Make sure to note on the invitation what the party is by including something like “Join us for a holiday open house.”If you’re not sure that your guests will know right away what you mean by “open house,” you can include a line such as “Pop in as you please!” to let them know the plan.

, No need to go overboard on the holiday decor, but put a little effort into whatever decorations and music are appropriate for your tastes.If you have a fireplace, light a fire.
Decorate a tree and make sure it's lit during your party if you celebrate Christmas. Think about hanging garlands or lights around staircase railings, door archways, the fireplace mantle, and other areas.
Go with seasonal candles, like apples and cinnamon, to set the holiday mood. Simmering potpourri or a warm apple cider will also add a festive fragrance.
Choose seasonal music, or play holiday movies on the TV. Set movies on low volume or mute for a little background ambience.
Consider getting a few poinsettias to put around the house. Or, get a couple bouquets of any flowers to place in vases around the house. Flowers are a quick and effective way to dress your home up for any occasion.

, You could hire a neighborhood teen to come to the party and play with the kids so the adults can mingle. Since holiday open houses are typically understood as kid-friendly, consider setting up a kid’s activity area in a side corner. Offer toys, games, or some quick and easy activity to keep them busy.Try to set up the kid zone away from the buffet, ornaments, little porcelain villages, candles, vases, and other holiday breakables.
Think about including a simple, low-mess holiday craft, like coloring books or origami ornaments. Stay away anything messy or that might require close supervision, like glue.
If you don’t want kids at your open house, be sure to make a note in the invitation to avoid confusion. Consider including a line like, ""A holiday gathering for grown-ups"" or simply, ""No children, please."" You could also mention a specific age like, ""Please, no guests under age 16,"" or if you know good babysitters then write, ""We'd be happy to recommend sitters!""

, Write down ingredients you’ll need for food and beverages, flowers, kids’ activity items, decorations, candles, and anything else you’ll need to buy. Make lists of all the tasks you’ll need to accomplish, from ironing linens to cleaning the bathrooms. Decide where you’ll put coats, where the buffet will be, and where drinks will be served."

Only use sites that are easy to access.,
Find the lowest prices.,
Don’t forget to factor in shipping.",How to Last Minute Holiday Shop1," Shopping online is a great way to holiday shop, but if the site you’re using is disorganized and poorly designed, you should look elsewhere. An easy-to-access shopping site ideal for the last-minute holiday shopper should be accessible on mobile devices and desktop computers alike.Additionally, the site you’re shopping on should quickly provide relevant information about the product you’re looking for. For instance, if you’re shopping for computer monitors at the last minute, you should be able to enter a search in the site’s search bar and quickly get information about the monitors available. You should be able to customize and organize the results by brand, size, and price.;
, When last-minute holiday shopping, you’ll get better deals the closer you get to the holiday. However, if you get a great deal too close to the holiday, you might have to pay extra for rush delivery, which could negate any savings you might have had.Buy online on Green Monday. Green Monday is December 12, and many online retailers offer deep discounts on this day.
December 16 is free shipping day for hundreds of stores. Look for free shipping deals on this day from one or more of the stores with an online presence at http://www.freeshippingday.com/.

, Shipping has two important components that the last-minute holiday shopper should be concerned with. First, you must check the shipping costs.Second, you must ensure that you’re ordering something that will actually arrive by the holiday you’re celebrating.Shipping a small toy or game might not have much – if any – added shipping cost. But a larger item – a piano, guitar, or computer – will probably have a significant added shipping cost.
If you order something on Christmas Eve, it likely will not arrive on Christmas. Check the expected shipping and delivery date during your last-minute online holiday shopping.
Alternately, if delivery will take too long, you might be able to accelerate the process of getting the gifts you want in your hands by selecting in-store pickup when you order online. Just choose the “pickup in-store” option when checking out."

Start planning your menu early.,
Choose a few low maintenance buffet items.,
Make a big, gorgeous salad.,
Serve a healthy homemade hummus.,
Make mini meatballs.,
Serve an easy tomato basil bruschetta.",How to Host a Healthy Holiday Open House2," Since the whole point of a holiday open house is to stay stress-free, you’ll want to give yourself some time to organize your food and beverage menus. That way, you won’t make things hectic by waiting until the last minute. Since a healthy menu is a priority, you’ll want to be able to spend some time putting together healthier options instead of going with quicker items, like chips and dip.In addition to healthier options, plan on including small plates with grab-and-go food items. This will decrease the amount of food and lower calorie counts.

, Four or five food choices is plenty for a holiday open house. Plan on each of your guests having at least a couple of each item you’re serving so you don’t run low. The general rule for parties is that each guest will eat between a half pound and a pound of food, but at an open house, you’ll find some people will dig in while others will just pick.Including a good bulk option with visual appeal, like a salad, is an excellent option.
It’s a “grazing party,” so try to include buffet items that can be enjoyed at room temperature and that will stay pretty over the course of a few hours. Think salad, bruschetta, fruit and veggie plates, mini meatballs, and cocktail shrimp.
You can always swap out or reheat warm or hot items, but do remember you’ll want to spend lots of time with your guests. Try to keep the buffet low maintenance.

, A salad can be a beautiful, healthy way to anchor your buffet. Keep it simple, elegant, and be sure to include salad dressing on the side so it doesn’t get soggy.


Try a winter seasonal salad by tossing together kale, shredded red cabbage, and shredded carrots. Top it with toasted pumpkin seeds and pair it with a zesty vinegar-based dressing.You could also do a simple arugula salad tossed with sliced red onion and a bit of grated parmesan. Top with prosciutto if you’d like, and pair with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

, Soak 3 cups of dried chickpeas at room temperature for at least 12 hours. Drain well and rinse, then transfer to a large pot filled with water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook at a boil for 5 minutes, then reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes.Remove from heat, ladle out a couple cups of the cooking water and set aside. Drain and rinse the cooked chickpeas with cool water.
Transfer to a food processor or blender and add the reserved cooking water, 1 1/2 cups tahini, 3/4 cup olive oil, 3 cloves garlic, the juice of 3 lemons, 1 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, and 1 teaspoon salt. Puree until smooth, about 5 minutes.
Serve with pita bread, or with sliced carrot or celery chips for gluten-free option. If you don’t feel like making your own hummus, just buy an appropriate amount for the number of your people you invited!

, Use 2 pounds of lean ground beef, or substitute lean ground turkey for a healthier option. Combine well with 2 cups breadcrumbs, 1 cup skim milk, 1/2 cup finely chopped parsley, 4 medium eggs (lightly beaten), 2 cloves minced garlic, and 1 medium chopped onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste.Shape into 1 tablespoon-sized meatballs, using a scoop to help control portion size. Place on a shallow baking pan or sheet, put in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, and bake for 25 minutes. Insert a toothpick into each meatball for easier serving.
Increase or decrease recipe proportions based on the number of your guests.

, Slice a baguette or long loaf of bread. Place the slices in a broiler pan, and broil on high for a few minutes each side, keeping an eye on them through the oven window as they char. Rub the toasts with smashed garlic cloves and drizzle them with a bit of olive oil.Cut 3 or 4 plum tomatoes in half. Squeeze out the seeds and juicy, then dice. Place diced tomatoes in a small serving bowl.
Take a couple dozen basil leaves, stack them, and roll them then chop finely to chiffonade them. Combine with the diced tomatoes, then add a drizzle of olive oil and a dash of kosher or sea salt. Provide a serving spoon with the topping, and arrange the toasts on a platter around or near the bowl.

Serve a variety of basic, low calorie non-alcoholic drinks.,
Prepare an easy, fresh signature cocktail.,
Serve white wine or sangria.,
Make mulled cider.",How to Host a Healthy Holiday Open House3," In addition to more festive beverages, be sure to include an assortment of easy, basic beverages. Have a pitcher of unsweetened tea handy, along with flat and sparkling water pitchers with sliced fruit or citrus twists on the side.Hot coffee, tea, and hot cocoa are also great non-alcoholic holiday beverage options.
Try to keep it easy for guests to serve themselves beverages so you and your spouse don’t get stuck in the kitchen mixing drinks.

, If you choose to serve alcohol, encourage the use of jiggers to prevent guests from overindulging, and to keep calorie counts low. You can also premix a delicious, fresh signature drink, like a cucumber vodka spritzer.


Slice a cucumber and add to a pitcher filled with a bottle of vodka for at least a day to infuse. Pour into a punch bowl, and 4 cups diet tonic or soda water, 2 cups of cucumber juice, 1 cup of lime juice, and, if you want to splurge a bit,1 cup of simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water, boiled together then cooled). Omit the simple syrup to keep it healthier.
Mix ingredients well then serve in rocks glasses over ice. Garnish with a sprig of mint.

, White wine is generally preferred over red to serve for an afternoon get together. As a bonus, avoiding red wine will help keep rugs, carpeting, and upholstered furniture free from difficult stains. You can also prepare a batch of white wine sangria:For everyone bottle of wine you use in the sangria, add 1/2 cup of brandy, 1/4 cup of orange liqueur, 4 tablespoons simple syrup, 1/2 cup of orange juice, 1 sliced orange, and 1 sliced lemon. Omit the simple syrup and brandy to keep it healthier, and add extra sliced citrus fruit as substitutions.
Mix ingredients well in a punch bowl and serve over ice.

, Bring 2 quarts apple cider, 2 cinnamon sticks, 2 whole allspice berries, 2 whole cloves, and 1 sliced orange to a simmer on the stovetop. Alternatively, combine these ingredients in a slow cooker set to low.Look for diet or low sugar apple cider options at the store to lower the calorie count.
Ladle into mugs and serve with a cinnamon stick.
Increase the recipe’s ratios to make enough for however many guests you invite.

Adopt a flexible school schedule.,
Give your children a few days off.,
Plan on taking field trips.",How to Find Time to Homeschool During the Holidays1," Depending on how you normally schedule your children’s homeschooling, you may need to think more flexibly during the holidays. It’s fine to interrupt the school day for a holiday activity—for example, decorating the Christmas tree or cooking Thanksgiving dinner—and then ask kids to complete their homework later in the day.


For example, you can also ask children to complete reading-based homework in the car while you’re driving to visit friends or relatives. If you are planning to host a holiday party one afternoon, let the kids know that they need to complete all of their school work in the morning, or let them stay up late to finish their work after the party.;
, It’s unrealistic to expect your children to complete their schoolwork every day during the holidays. Give your children a few days off from schooling; this will take off some of the pressure that you and your children feel surrounding homeschooling during the holidays, and will give children some fun, school-free days to look forward to.


Make it known to the kids that they will have a few days off over the holidays: at least Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day.

, It’s perfectly acceptable to include field trips in your homeschool curriculum, especially over the holidays. This will help you and your kids get out of the house, and add elements of fun to education during the holidays. Take children to local art, history, and natural history museums, or to seasonally appropriate outdoor locations.Be aware that, if you take field trips when public schools are not in session, locations may be crowded with other children and families.
You can also plan educational field trips around your regular holiday travels plans and activities. For example, children can learn about botany and tree identification when cutting a Christmas tree.

Check the hours of stores before you visit.,
Inquire about free gift-wrapping.,
Don’t give up on Christmas Eve.,
Check out grocery and convenience stores.,
Think local.",How to Last Minute Holiday Shop2," Depending on how last-minute your holiday shopping is, the stores you’re interested in visiting might be operating on different hours. In the weeks before the holidays, many stores extend their hours to allow additional shoppers to shop later and/or earlier. But if you cut it too close to December 25, you might find that shops are closed early – or altogether.It might be best to shop during the extended or early hours. You’ll beat the rush of other shoppers who – unlike you – haven’t been careful enough to check whether the store’s hours have been adjusted for the holidays.
Early hours shopping will also give you the best chance to find full, well-stocked shelves before the great mass of shoppers have descended upon the store., If you’re shopping for the holidays at the last minute, you’ll have even less time to get all your gifts wrapped. Ask about complimentary gift-wrapping services at the stores where you do your shopping. Toy and book stores, especially, tend to be quite good about providing wrapping, gratis., Whether you celebrate Christmas or not, Christmas Eve and Christmas are the days that many stores choose to close. But even if you’re still not done with your holiday shopping on Christmas Eve, you might still be able to find stores that are open. Keep looking for what you want to get right up until the holidays arrive.In a way, shopping at the very last moment (even on Christmas Eve) can make your shopping experience better because you’ll be less likely to encounter large crowds of people.

, Grocery stores and convenience stores are usually not the first place holiday shoppers go to find gifts for the loved ones on their shopping list. But these smaller stores can be perfect for stocking stuffers like candy, small toys, and other holiday knickknacks.Pharmacies are also great for small gifts, candy, and knickknacks., When you’re shopping last minute, you might not have time to make a big trip out to a large shopping center where stores of greater variety are. Instead, look for holiday shopping opportunities in your immediate area. For instance, set a travel limit – say, 20 miles in any direction – and stick to it."

Purchase gift cards.,
Give an experience.,
Choose a consumable.,
Pick up some items for the home.,
Buy toys and games.,
Make something instead of buying.,
Spend more time planning.Just because you’re holiday shopping at the last moment doesn’t mean you’ve been doing nothing up through the period just before the holidays.,
Identify deals.",How to Last Minute Holiday Shop3," Gift cards are an easy way to make a gift to someone without worrying about choosing the right color, size, or brand of whatever it is you intended to purchase for the people on your shopping list. You can get digital gift cards through the websites of most major retailers, and the recipient can use it online. Alternately, you could visit the store in person and get an actual card that the recipient can then use in person.Many grocery stores also sell gift cards to a variety of restaurants, digital retailers, and other big-box retailers.

, According to research, people who spend on experiences rather than objects often experience greater satisfaction. Instead of giving an object to the loved ones on your holiday shopping list, consider giving plane tickets to a favored vacation destination, or (if you’re of more modest means) tickets to an upcoming theater performance.Shopping at the last minute doesn’t mean you’ll have fewer opportunities to make a holiday gift of a great experience.For instance, you can obtain gift certificates or passes for rafting trips, amusement park visits, concert tickets, or movie tickets.
Even dinner at a nice restaurant with your partner can be a great last-minute holiday gift.If you can’t find such an “experience gift” in your immediate area, check online for more options. Alternately, you could create your own gift certificate by using an online gift certificate template and printing out the specific experience you want to give the recipient. Later, the recipient can “cash it in” with you by asking to have the experience in question.
A simple gift certificate, set of tickets, or passes for a unique experience will save you time that you’d otherwise spend wrapping.

, Holiday-themed cookies, tea, and candies could be a good choice for last minute gifts. For instance, pick up some chocolate gelt, blue-and-white cookies, or a relevant tea set for Hanukkah.Consumables are readily available during the holidays, so picking some up at the last minute can help you devote more time to hunting down harder-to-find holiday gifts.

, A tea kettle and/or tea cup set, a cutlery set, or a new blender might be just right for the culinarily-inclined person in your life. Alternately, some quality furniture might be in order. A new bookshelf or nightstand, for instance, could be great gifts for someone who needs or wants them. Identify functional items that someone might enjoy and provide it for them in the form of a holiday gift.Home items are perfect when shopping for a couple. Instead of buying two people two gifts, give the couple a gift they can enjoy together.

, Last-minute holiday shoppers love buying toys and games.If you have a young person in your life, or an adult who has the heart of a child, they might enjoy a new toy or game.Video games, puzzles, chess sets, action figures, and other playthings are great because they don’t need to be matched to a specific holiday.
No matter their family traditions, every kid loves getting new toys and games.
Because of their popularity as holiday gifts, shopping for toys and games (even at the last minute) will give you a wide variety of options to choose from.

, If you’ve waited until the last minute to do your holiday shopping, you might be better off giving a gift that you made yourself like holiday-themed cookies, a homemade holiday card, or a knitted winter scarf instead of trying to find something to buy. Homemade gifts are often prized because they have a personal touch that mass-produced gifts do not.Put holiday cookies you baked in an appropriate tin. For instance, if you’re giving Christmas cookies, put them in a Christmas-themed tin.
If you’re making a card, use heavy-duty cardstock available from an arts and crafts store.

, Use the time you’ve not been shopping to find out what people want, and develop a solid shopping list for all the special people in your life.The best way to find out what someone special in your life wants for the holidays is to ask them. Just ask, “So, what would you like for Christmas?”

, As the holidays approach, retailers that haven’t sold adequate amounts of their wares might decide to boost sales by offering even deeper sales.You might find great deals online and through apps like SlickDeals, too.Holiday sales and deals are especially common when it comes to holiday-themed goods like cards that are aimed at people who celebrate a particular holiday. For instance:If you celebrate Christmas, you might be able to find discounted stockings and tree ornaments
If you celebrate Kwanzaa, you may be able to find discounted candelabras or African-themed décor
If you celebrate Hanukkah, you might be able to find discounted menorahs or dreidels

Let go of your typical rigorous schedule.,
Blend education and fun.,
Take advantage of educational videos.",How to Find Time to Homeschool During the Holidays2," The holidays are a busy time, and many families find their time consumed with travel, cooking, purchasing gifts, decorating the house, church obligations, and visits to and from family and friends. It’s unlikely that you’ll be able to keep up your typical homeschool schedule and still have fun over the holidays.


Try picking two or three mandatory subjects that your kids will continue to study—for example, math, science, and literature—and let the others go until January.If you focus on the necessary subjects and relax your schedule, you and your children will be able to enjoy family time without worrying about meeting school deadlines.

, The holidays are a great time to introduce more fun, relaxing educational elements into your homeschool curriculum. Let your children help with holiday decorating and crafts. These activities can be made educational, as kids can help with family budgeting, and making decorative crafts can be counted as your children’s art class.For music or media studies, encourage children to listen to Christmas recordings—including classic carols, but also Christmas themed jazz, rock, and other genres—and watch Christmas films. If your children play instruments, give them holiday-themed music to learn and perform.

, If you won’t have time over the holidays to plan detailed lessons for your children, or to grade their assignments, opt for less intensive educational methods, including videos.Your children can tailor their video selection to their own interests, and will probably be able to find a few holiday-themed educational films online as well.


Online providers like Netflix and Amazon Prime offer many educational videos, including historical dramas and nature shows. Depending on your children’s age and maturity level, they could watch films and shows including Race, Free State of Jones, and Planet Earth.

Incorporate educational holidays activities into your schooling.,
Teach math with cooking.,
Adapt your literature and writing assignments to the season.",How to Find Time to Homeschool During the Holidays3," During the holidays, it’s okay to depart from book-based education and conventional subjects—after all, most children in public school have this time off from school. Look for the educational aspects of the activities you’re already doing for the holidays, and view these as learning opportunities for your children.This will work better with younger children, who will have more to learn from daily activities. Older children—e.g. ones in high school—will likely need to stick to their textbooks.

, Since you and your children will likely be cooking plenty of holiday meals and dishes, take this opportunity to teach math without a textbook.For example, baking uses many mathematical elements. If you have young children, ask them to double or halve the amounts of flour, sugar, salt, and other ingredients.


If you don’t want to actually make double or halve of a recipe, ask kids to simply work out the solutions on a sheet of paper.

, We have a wealth of literature set during the holidays, and many well-known stories, poems, and novels deal with Christmas directly. Since you and your family will likely already be reading these Christmas classics, “assigning” them to your children will seem more like holiday fun than an educational chore.


Well-known examples of Christmas literature include Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol,” Clement Moore’s “Twas the Night Before Christmas,” and Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Fir Tree,” and Truman Capote’s “A Christmas Memory.”You can also use the holidays as a time to give your children seasonal writing prompts. Ask young children to write poems detailing things they are thankful for, and have older children write more mature, reflective essays or short stories.

Select the stationery.,
Understand what makes up a wedding invitation.,
Decide whether you'll use handwriting or pre-printing.",How to Address Wedding Invitations1," Visit a quality stationery store to browse through the wedding invitation selections. Keep in mind the price you are willing to pay for your cards, as well as the wedding color theme, time of year, and particular details important to you.


If you are having the invitations created by a printer, browse their paper selection. Stationery printers will have sample books you can browse through to get ideas;
, There is the outer envelope, invitation card, reply card, and reception card.The outer envelope: This is where the stamp, guest address, and return address go for posting.

The invitation card: The invitation is the centerpiece of the invitation set--it includes all of the most important information about your wedding, including location, time, and date. The invitation will also generally list whether or not attire is formal or casual and gives your guests an idea of the theme and color choices of the wedding.You can choose to place the invitation in its own envelope. While this is not necessary, it is a nice touch.

The reply card: This is a pre-prepared RSVP card that will let you know how many of your invited guests are coming, and if they are bringing dates or plus-ones. The reply card can either be its on separate card with a self-addressed return envelope or it can be printed like a postcard. Generally the couple sending out the invitations will put postage on the return envelope or postcard so that their guests are more likely to quickly send it back.A reception card: A reception card is useful for when the reception will be at a different location than the wedding. Put the address, time, and any other details specific to your reception on this card. Generally the reception card is smaller than the invitation card but printed on the same stationary and written in the same style..This can also be printed on the invitation if you would prefer to save paper.

, Generally the items within the invitation (the invitation itself, reply card, and reception card) are pre-printed, while the outer envelope and names on the invitations are handwritten. Handwriting the addresses and names adds a personal touch. However, there are some factors to keep in mind.


If your handwriting is elegant and legible, you should address the envelopes yourself. Choose a blue or black ink and stick with the same pen for the inner and outer envelopes. Handwriting the names and addresses allows for a more personal effect.
To save on time, particularly if you are planning on having a very large ceremony, you should probably choose to pre-print your envelope addresses. Select a fancy font and have a printer address the labels for you. Make sure that the print is legible for the mail carrier and recipient.
You also have the option to have a printer print address labels, which you will have to attach to the envelopes yourself. You will have the option to choose from clear, colorful, or white labels. You might consider making up some return address labels so that you do not have to write your own address on each envelope.

Set a budget.,
Set the timeline for planning.,
Choose a workable method for your record-keeping.",How to Plan Your Wedding1," It's important to stick to a budget and to keep your wishes realistic. While this is a very special day your life, it's not an excuse to be wildly extravagant with money you don't have. Remind yourself when you feel like fretting that you still have many wonderful days ahead and you don't want these marred by paying back an unplanned overspend.


Aim to never exceed the amount specified as the total of your budget. If you overspend on one item, another item has to take a cut to meet the budget. Be prepared to be flexible and to prioritize the big spends that really matter. You can always make do or DIY on the things that are less important or even the frivolous but desired aspects.
If your parents or future in-laws are partially or wholly funding the wedding, you have an added help. However, remain conscious to not burden them either. Ask them for their budget ceiling and stick to it.;
, Of all things about your planning, this is the most important aspect. Develop a sensible, reasonable timeline depending on how much time you've given yourselves. Begin with a calendar before you and try following a suggested timeline from a wedding guide. You will find such timelines in wedding guide books, magazines, online and even at the base of this article. In general, you're likely to find that most guides assume you have around 12 months to plan your wedding; if you've less time, simply adjust the timeline accordingly (the last three months matter the most anyway). (Timeline suggestions will be provided throughout this article.)


Don't panic if you don't have 12 months. Generally what planning guides suggest happens in the first few months are things that can be done fairly quickly, such as announcing your engagement, sending the announcement to local papers, purchasing planning books and software, planning the budget, selecting the bridal party and settling on a wedding date.
One of the principal reasons for a long lead-in time is the wedding and reception venues––the most popular ones are often booked out a year or more in advance and many people have taken to planning the wedding around venue availability. If this irks you or you just don't have a year, look around for great alternatives, from public garden spaces, to lesser known churches and mosques or town halls. Avoid the trap of thinking you have to use the venue every other bride is using this year!

, You'll need to keep tabs of everything you've already decided and what's planned ahead. Also, invoices, quotes, receipts, seating plans, photos of desired decorations/clothing, patterns, instructions, etc. will need to be kept in one place, so have at least one large plastic pocket to keep these in one place. If you're more organized, use a few pockets to separate by categories.


Wedding software or planning apps can work well for digital planning. If you have tech-savvy friends helping plan the wedding, you might even consider making a wedding wiki open only to those of you helping with the planning. This can help enormously with shared planning and strategizing. On the downside, software and wikis need to be maintained through the inputting of information and scanning in documents, while a notebook can be taken anywhere and you can jot down things quickly and you can simply add the growing mound of papers to a binder. For many people, both digital and paper planning tools combined are the best of both worlds.

Congratulations!",How to Plan a Wedding in Six Months," Get into the right frame of mind. Be prepared to compromise. Enter into the planning of your wedding with an open mind and flexibility. You may have it all planned out in your mind but not keeping your ideas flexible will leave you frustrated and disappointed. Be ready to alter your ideas of what your dream wedding is. Not only will you need to be flexible with your planning but you need to be willing to make compromises financially. Don't try to over plan or be too controlling. Take everything with a grain of salt and a sense of humor.;
, This is the first step in planning any wedding but even more important when planning on a short time line. Because of the short time frame the money you spend won't be spread out over a year or two. You need to look at what funds you have to spend and be able to live and pay your bills. You may need to scale down the vision of your wedding. It's very easy to rely on credit but you need to seriously consider if entering into a marriage with enormous bills is a healthy start just to have an over the top wedding. No one wants to start a marriage in bankruptcy court. The number one reason for young marriages failing is financial stress. Keep your eye on the ball.

, Determine how many people you can entertain with the budget and space you have available. As you proceed through the planning process, your guest list size may influence your destination choice, and likewise your destination choice may affect how many people you can invite. If you start getting an idea of guests together early, it will help you throughout the whole planning process. Start getting their addresses together, but don't worry about invitations until you're sure you want to invite (and can accommodate).

, Make sure it has a calendar and pockets to store brochures and clippings. This helps you organize your ideas and helps you store contact information all in one place. Write down vendors you have talked to along with contact information and appointment dates and times. You can also add swatches of fabric and photos of flowers to show to your florist.


Start planning as soon as you decide on a date! If you take care of everything in the beginning, you have more time to enjoy your engagement and more time to focus on the small, minor details (e.g. the font color of your invitations).

, The time line will differ depending on where you live and the bridal market. The time line could change drastically if you were planning your wedding for January or June. Most of the following steps need to be completed in the first month to month and a half to get the vendors (florist, photographers, dresses, etc.) booked or picked in time if you're in an average sized city. When planning something fast the bulk of the decisions are made in month one. You just spend the other months fine tuning and hoping the wheels don't come off the wagon.

, These are usually the easiest to do on short notice. All you need to do is show up, get married and have a great time. This may end up costing you less money in the long run. Weigh your options. Most resorts have everything in place and can schedule multiple events with no problem on short notice.


The travel will help filter your guest list and you may find only your best friends and closest family will attend.
This often combines the wedding, reception and honeymoon all into one for more savings.
Flowers and a cake are often included in the cost.
Some hotels in Las Vegas (US) are able to do lovely and tasteful weddings. Don't assume every officiant in Las Vegas is an Elvis impersonator.
Give everyone a heads up if traveling outside the country. It takes time to get passports. Don't wait for the invitation to go out. Remind everyone that it takes longer to get their passports and they shouldn't delay. Don't assume everyone knows that passports aren't quick to turn around.

, Have a great party instead of a formal affair. Be creative and try to plan something fun. Remember at the end of the day you're still married, so try not to be as stuffy with your wedding when you're short on time. Think out of the box and you'll save your sanity and have a more memorable wedding than your friends who planned twice as long and spent ten times as much.


Get married at the zoo and ride on an elephant. Have caged animals around the reception hall with their caretakers to answer questions. Have the bride wear a white cotton casual dress and the groom in khaki. You can also do a lovely suit and a white dress with an exotic flower in your hair.
Get married on Halloween weekend and have everyone come in costume. Rent some great Victorian costumes (well in advance), Romeo and Juliet or any other couple. Decorate with cauldrons and dry ice. No one will forget it!
Get married on the beach in the morning and have a reception at a local restaurant for a great brunch in a private room.
Go to the mountains and get married on the slopes. Instead of the dresses and tuxedos you use white snow gear and dark snow gear. Pin lovely flowers to you ski jacket. The party can be inside the lodge.
Find a sailboat and ask about having a modest party aboard for the ceremony, they can sail everyone back to dock for a great clambake or try a nearby restaurant.

, Call your ceremony location options to find out what is available and how the cost fits into your overall plan. If you wait, you risk the date being unavailable. If you find a place you like that is available and in your price range you should book it and not wait.


If the site is out of your price range or booked, you can inquire about having it on an alternate day. Friday and Sunday weddings have become more and more common especially in large cities where there is incredible demand and cost associated with Saturdays. They may offer Fridays or Sundays at a reduced rate.
Also ask of the possibility of having a morning wedding if there is another event later in the day.
Be realistic, A Valentine's Day wedding will be extremely hard to book on short notice unless you can be really creative. The prices also skyrocket on that day with supply and demand.
Ask what the refund or cancellation policy is for booking on short notice. They may have contracts that state you must cancel at least 6 months before to get a deposit back. Since you are already within this window you should be very careful what you book and offer deposits. Also ask if the contracts can be changed since you are booking late. They may give you an extra month in the cancellation/reschedule window of time.

, Consider the usual reception halls but also look into historic buildings, museums, vineyards, art galleries, botanical gardens, historic hotels with parlors. Zoos can also be a unique place for a reception that may be more affordable, available on a short time line and really make a fast turn around wedding memorable.


Determine if a reception location is available where you are having the ceremony. This will make things much easier to plan and more affordable. You won't have to arrange transportation for the wedding party and this will be one less thing to book and put a deposit on.
If you are having trouble finding an available reception location, call your local caterer and ask them for a list of local reception sites. They are usually more than willing to help, especially if you are a potential customer.
Consider having a wedding around a major holiday where churches and reception halls may already be decorated.
You can easily have a wedding with 30 people attending in a parlor of an old home, historic site or building, lovely private garden or exterior site with a view. With so few people attending you can easily move the event to a great spot out of town so don't feel like you must plan within the city limits. Consider the beach, neighboring town, parks, outdoor site with a great view or lovely historic site in your state.

, Certain religions or churches require couples to attend pre-wedding counseling. If you want a religious officiant, your officiant will likely want to meet with you and your partner before the wedding to discuss the vows, how they usually conduct ceremonies and other details. Don't wait until the last minute. Ministers book well in advance but they can usually do several ceremonies in one day. You may need to be flexible with your time if you must have your preferred officiant. If they aren't available you can ask if an associate pastor is available or if they can recommend someone else.

, Compromise. Have a small wedding with immediate family and friends. Plan a big party/reception with all your friends and a big spread a few months after the wedding or on your first anniversary. You'll have time to really plan. This is a common practice following intimate weddings. The benefits include:


You can plan it on a Friday night and aren't restricted to having a later afternoon or evening wedding.
You won't be stressed and can enjoy it
You won't have to leave mid-party for your honeymoon
You have an excuse to wear your wedding dress or buy a great white cocktail dress.
You get to celebrate twice.
You can have a destination wedding or elope and still have a reception or party afterwards for all your friends to attend.

, Wedding dress shopping can be fun but most places take up to 4-6 months to have your dress shipped to you. This is the last thing you want to worry about. Remember, there are alterations that may need to happen as well. Instead of going to a shop that special orders go to the bridal stores that carry multiple dresses in stock. Try to find a dress off the rack that doesn't need to be ordered. You don't have time for constant fittings. Remember that when trying things on. Sometimes that awesome dress seems a lot less awesome when you are dress-less on your wedding day or bald from pulling your hair out.


Dresses that lace up the back are easier to fit and will require fewer trips to the seamstress.
You may need to drive to a larger city to find a store with multiple sizes in multiple dresses. Take friends or family who are easy to shop with and won't make the process more difficult. Take your bra and a pair of heels to check the length. Take a pair of Spanx (stretch undergarment to reduce your dress size). If you find a dress that is too tight, try it again with the under-support. Take a camera and get a picture of you in the dress if it is allowed.
Keep the venue in mind. A Princess Diana cathedral train won't work in every venue. The smaller the venue, the smaller the train. If you don't know the venue yet, go with a shorter train and modest dress.
Don't be afraid of consignment shops. If the dress isn't perfect you can always have them remove some of the bulk fairly easily but don't go for the complete reconstruction unless you're comfortable with your seamstress.
Cherish your heritage and ask your mother, grandmother, aunts, etc. if anyone has their dress. Vintage gowns make the event much more special. Chances are good they'd be honored to have you wear their dress and won't mind you having it altered. Just ask.

,


Consider nixing the traditional bridal party. Ask one close family member to stand with the bride and one with the groom. The maid of honor can wear one of her dresses or cocktail dresses and the best man can wear a suit. Even if you have four sisters, just explain and let them know you can only have one. Ask you mother to stand with you. You really don't need all the maids, junior brides maids, flower girls, ring bearers, etc. Keep it super simple.
Remember, the more people you ask, the more money and time it will cost in the long run.
Don't assume every one of your friends must be in the ceremony. Chances are they'll be secretly thankful since being in a wedding takes much time and money for everyone. If they love you they'll still help out and probably be more motivated.
There is a time crunch involved so be considerate of people who may be traveling long distances to be involved.
Surround yourself with people who are positive and helpful. You don't have time for drama queens or emotional vampires.

, Like wedding dresses, these can take several months to come in if you order them and may require your bridesmaids have them altered. Bridesmaids may not be as ""attentive"" to your time line so try to pick out dresses that are figure forgiving or have laces instead of zippers. They'll save alteration expenses and the minor details won't be a major problem if they don't use a good tailor/seamstress.


Check out the major department stores and bridal shops for the chance to buy off the hanger. Take your bridesmaids with you so they can try on.
Don't be afraid of different style dresses. So long as the color is the same you can use different styles. This could be a great way of finding dresses that fit a variety of body shapes without requiring major alterations.
Consider going to a department store formal gown department (and not in their bridal department) for your bridesmaids dresses rather than a bridal shop. They will get the dresses faster and can possibly save money as well. Layaway and alterations are sometimes included.

, Tuxedo measurements require multiple measurements and they are required to get the best fit. If they live out of town they can be measured by their nearest tuxedo rental shop and the measurements can be sent to your local tuxedo shop.


Never let a groomsmen guess his measurements or allow someone other than a tuxedo shop to take his measurements.
Have your groomsmen pick up their tuxedos several days before the wedding. Thursday morning is usually the earliest for a Saturday wedding. They should try the tuxedos, shoes, etc. on immediately. If there was a problem with size or a measurement, the store can still use a day or two to sort it out and possibly have another size shipped in.

, Most photographers are busy and have limited schedules. But if you start early, your date is more likely to be available. Consider asking a friend whom you know takes great pictures. You may have to sacrifice the posed photos since those take practice to set up.


Remember that an experienced professional wedding photographer would produce quality images, whatever the weather or regardless of any unforeseen circumstances.
Ask around at your local camera store if they know of any budding photographers or anyone starting off in bridal work. They may know of someone who is not in the telephone directory who does great work.
Ask to see all their pictures from a complete wedding, not just the 'best of' from several weddings
The perception is that digital costs less so the overhead will be minimal. Photographers will tell you the capital investment in professional equipment is far higher, and the time spent editing the photographs is far more intensive than the days of film. Weigh the cost with the quality, ask questions and use someone you can communicate with easily.
You might want to save money by making an arrangement with the photographer and getting a CD of your pictures, and then having the actual photos printed yourself at a local photo shop.
Remember that the photographer owns the copyright (by law, whoever clicks the shutter owns it), so ensure that any reproduction of images is permitted in writing by the photographer.
Add disposable cameras to reception tables. Leave a note telling guests to take photos and leave the cameras. Remind them the cameras are not toys for their kids.

, Most national department stores and discount stores have a bridal gift registry available. The national chains also make it easier for people out of town.


If you're having a small and simple wedding you should keep your gift list requests modest and focus on the essentials (towels, casual china, cookware, serving items, etc.).
If you have a larger budget and can go all out for the wedding and reception despite the short time frame you can go for more lavish gift requests like expensive fine china, crystal and silver.
Etiquette suggest that everyone invited to showers should also be invited to the wedding and/or reception. The exception is a destination wedding with reception or showers/luncheons thrown by co-workers.
Guys can have showers too. If the couple needs many items to start off, have a male relative or friend throw a yard or tool party for the groom. Make sure he registers for the items.
Register at one or two stores. Try to think of stores convenient to friends and family.
Remember to buy thank you notes and stamps. Send them out as quickly as possible after you receive a gift or if someone helps you with your wedding in some way. You don't have much time and if you get sidetracked you may not get the card out in the appropriate time frame.

, If you find one that is reputable and available you should book them. Hopefully, you've looked through bridal books and floral design sites to get ideas on how you'd like your flowers to look. Ideally, you printed pictures and stored them in your bridal book.


Not all flowers are available year round. You may discover you are paying almost double for a flower that is out of season and difficult to come by but could be replaced with a similar flower with more availability.
Ask your florist what ideas they may have to make the cost more affordable.
Consider simple designs of one flower or a few simple flowers tied with a lovely ribbon. It keeps cost down! Don't forget that flowers are usually dead by the next day.
Can't find a florist? Don't panic! You'll just need to rethink and compromise.

Call all of the florists back and ask about renting the potted plants, having them do the corsages and boutonnieres for you to pick up everything the day before. Have them use hardy flowers!
Have them prepare simple but hardy flowers wrapped in ribbon for the bouquets (again, picked up by you the day before and stored in water).
The florist still does a lot of the work but you'll need to pick it up the day before, put everything out and maybe even take the rental plants back to the florist.
They may see this as a way to add on additional business without actually having to visit a wedding site to decorate.



, Try to pick ones that won't require a lot of assembly once they come in. Those invitations with the ribbons are cute but do you really have time to put them together, stuff the envelopes, address the envelopes and mail?


Most bridal stores have invitation books for ordering. Ask ahead what the turn around time is.
You may be better off getting a simple invitation from a local printer. With the technology available, most local printers can do just as good of a job. They may also feel more compelled to do better work because you're local and reputation is everything.

, Discuss various menus and costs. Also discuss whether you will offer alcohol and how it will be served.


Are you going to offer a full sit down meal? It may be less expensive to offer heavy hors d'oeuvres or a buffet. That may free up more money for alcohol.
Consider only offering beer, wine and champagne to save additional cost.
Don't offer alcohol. Save even more by offering coffee, tea or punch following an early afternoon wedding.
So long as the reception isn't during a mealtime you can avoid providing lots of food. Plan your wedding after lunch but before dinner to cut catering cost. Guests will have eaten.
Offer a coffee and cake reception with finger sandwiches, cheese platters and punch and other finger foods. Use a deli to prepare the sandwiches and have a volunteer set out the food. Skip a caterer all together.
Establish what happens to the left over food and beverage. It's yours if you pay for it. Save the leftovers and freeze them, pack a picnic basket for your honeymoon trip. Bring storage containers and ask someone to pack it up once the reception is over.
Determine when you must give them a final head count or last date to change the menu. If your budget gets out of control it's nice to be able to shave back on the catering.
Determine if you need to get a one day license to serve alcohol or if it is provided by the reception venue or caterer.

, Tell them how many people will be attending. Let them know if your wedding will be inside or out so they can advise you of what ingredients will stand up under the weather. No one wants to see a melted cake.

, If you are booking a band or a DJ you should start checking around and see who is good for the venue. On a short time schedule, a DJ may be more affordable and more flexible. Ask around and see who is recommended. As always, if the best is booked ask who they recommend. Meet and discuss the play list.


If you're planning something small, don't worry about entertaining everyone with a dance reception.
Call the local music college for deals on a small string section for the wedding.
For super small weddings you can forgo the music all together. If it is that intimate, everyone will know everyone and be talking anyway.

, Booking flights and hotels early can help save money, and it may take several months to get a passport and/or visas, if they're needed.

, Find out what is required by your state to apply for a marriage license. Do you or your partner need a copy of your birth certificates? Do you have an approved copy? Find out specifically what they require so you can order an appropriate copy or a signed original if needed. Do you need a copy of a divorce decree? You may have to contact the county where your divorce was finalized to acquire one.

, Continue to follow up and check the status of things with your party, vendors, etc. With a tight time line you can't let anyone lose focus.

, It is fine for them to be responsible for the cost themselves. Don't feel obligated to pay for it but don't give them specific style demands unless you are footing the bill.

, Keep this list in your planner. Add to it as you think of things. Discuss this with your bridesmaids or maid of honor. See if they can help you remember or take control of your bags.

, Here are some things you may need that are commonly needed and sometimes forgotten:


Duct tape. Seriously, this is the best at fixing hems, tears, holding bras in place, you name it. Super models use it and wedding planners swear by it.
Lighted make up mirror
Oscillating fan (Wedding dresses aren't comfortable to hang out in, she'll get quite warm while waiting.)
Advil, Tylenol, Pepto-Bismol
Extra makeup, powder, lipstick
Slippers or comfortable shoes for before the wedding or after if your feet get too sore
Baby powder--used to cover spots on the dress
Hair supplies: bobby pins, super hold hairspray, curling iron
Body supplies: deodorant, perfume, bra, foundation garments, etc.
Sewing kit with spools of thread in the color of the bride's dress, the brides maid's dresses and the tuxedos.

, You should be well on your way to a great and memorable wedding that will be a pleasure for you, your future spouse and your guests. Keep in mind that small, sweet and intimate is always better than big, impersonal and lavish.

Use the wedding guest list.,
Determine the relationship of the guests that you are sending each invitation to.,
Write the name(s) of the guest(s) in the middle of the envelope.,
Write the address below the names on the outer envelope.,
Ensure that your return address is on the outer envelope.",How to Address Wedding Invitations2," Reading names off of the wedding guest list will allow you to make sure you are spelling names correctly, and will help you to give each person his or her proper title.

, Is the invitation being sent to a family, a married couple, an unmarried couple, or a single guest? This information is important to know when you are addressing the envelope.

, Keep in mind their titles and marital status.Addressing a married couple with the same last name: Write Mr. Firstname and Mrs. Firstname Lastname. Example: Mr. John and Mrs. Jane Smith.

Addressing a married couple with different last names: Write the name of the person you are closer to first. If you are equally acquainted with both, list them in alphabetical order. Write Mr. Firstname Lastname and Mrs. Firstname Lastname (or switch the order). Example: Ms. Jane Doe and Mr. John Smith.

Addressing an unmarried couple: You can choose to format the names however you like, but generally the names are either separated by a comma or given their own lines. Write Mr. Firstname Lastname, Ms. Firstname Lastname. Example: Mr. John Smith, Ms. Jane Doe.

Addressing a family: Write the word ‘The’ followed by the family’s last name. Example: The Smiths. You could also write The Family Lastname. Example: The Family Smith.

Addressing a single individual: Write the title and first and last name of the individual. Example Ms. Emily Emerson or Mr. Jack Jones.

Addressing a doctor or doctors: If you are addressing a couple where one of the people is a doctor, list his or her name first preceded by ‘Dr.’. If both people are doctors, write Doctors Firstname and Firstname Lastname. Follow the same principles for anyone with a distinguished title, such as Rev. or Captain. Example of one doctor: Dr. Amanda and Mr. Nolan James. Example of both doctors: Doctors Amanda and Nolan James.

, This should be the address of the family or the person you are most familiar with in a couple (if the couple is not living together).


Do not abbreviate or use initials in the street address of the recipient.
Add post office box numbers if needed.

, The return address is important for knowing which guests did not receive their invitations.


If an invitation is returned to you unopened, it means that you probably have the wrong address. Call up your guest and confirm the correct address.

"
"
Write individual names on the inner envelope or invitation.,
Do not use initials as a substitute for names.,
Address the return envelopes.",How to Address Wedding Invitations3," If you are not going to put your invitation in its own envelope, leave a space at the top of the invitation so that you can write each individual guests name.Invitations to married couples who are elders or you are not on first name terms with: If the couple consists of your elders, or you want to show respect, always remember to put titles such as Mr., Mrs., or Dr. You do not necessarily need to put their first names. Example: Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

Invitations to friends and people with whom you are on a first name basis: If it s a married couple, write both of their first names. If it is an individual person, write his or her first name. Example: John and Jane.

Invitations to families: List out all the names of the family members who are invited to the wedding so long as they live under the same roof. You can choose whether or not to add their last name.Example: John, Jane, Bobby, Betsy, and Billy Smith.

, Suffixes such as Jr. & Sr. are an exception.

, These are the envelopes that your guests will send their responses in. You should put your names, house number and street, town, state, and zip code in the center of the address.


To save a whole lot of time, get pre-printed envelopes. Doing this will save time because you won’t have to write your address over and over again on all of the envelopes.

Decide on the size of your wedding.,
Choose the venue.,
Set the date.",How to Plan Your Wedding2," Remember to talk this over with the person you are engaged to. A dream wedding for one may not be right for the other. You'll need to know how many people are going to attend for the purposes of venues, catering and invitations.


As part of this decision, choose your bridal party. How many bridesmaids and groomsmen do you want? From none to a dozen, the choice depends on what you have always dreamed of and what space you'll have available for everyone to stand in at the ceremony. Remember that your total number of guests includes your bridal party.
This decision is usually done at around the ten-months-to-go mark.

, The sooner this is done, the better, so that you know you have the place you really want. Check out the spaces offered, the catering deals, the marriage fees, the ability to decorate a church or synagogue, wedding space, etc. Find out whether the prices quoted cover everything or whether you'll be expected to pay for extras.


Be aware that even church and synagogue venues may charge fees.
Research into venues for the wedding and reception usually starts around the 12 months-to-go mark, with bookings occurring within the month once you've made up your mind.

, The factors in choosing a date include the availability of your venue, friends and family. Think about who you must have at your wedding, and try to set the date with their availability in mind. Most people will do their best to accommodate a wedding, so unless you know this person has major surgery or a competing wedding in their calendar, you should be fairly right with directing their calendar.


Send out ""save the date"" cards to your guests. Once the venue and guest lists are confirmed, let everyone know what's coming up. Send emails if you know people will read them, otherwise, send cards to their postal addresses.
Setting the date usually occurs at the same time you've confirmed the place of the wedding and the place of the reception. Finalization of the guest list should be done when there are about seven months to go. Do expect some cancellations and possibly some last-minute additions due to illness, pregnancy, overseas travel, etc. It often can't be helped, so go with the flow.

"
"
Choose a theme.,
Send out the wedding invitations.",How to Plan Your Wedding3," It doesn't have to be anything really specific, but a successful event tends to have a consistent feeling throughout. Choose a theme that is easy to plan and decorate. Everything should be consistent with the theme.


You can usually hire someone that will decorate your wedding, but it can be expensive to do so.
Visit the venue and take pictures of how the area looks. You may want to measure the dimensions of the room or area, to allow you to plan where you want everything go and to know if you have enough space.
As part of the theme, research the flowers you want at the wedding. Find out if they're available during the time of your wedding or if they're out of season (the costs of flying them in can be very high). Finalize flowers around four months ahead of the wedding date.
Match decorations to the color theme for best overall appearance.

, Research into the design of your wedding invitations when you still have around 10 months to go, and work on purchasing or ordering their printing when there are about six months to go. Leave plenty of time if you're making your own and always have lots of spares, as making a mistake now and then in writing or making them is inevitable.


Be creative; you can make your own and add a personal touch or go to a professional.
Send out invitations around two months prior to the wedding; this should be sufficient time if you've already sounded out your guests and sent them ""save the date"" cards. (If Jewish, make sure to get kippots made.)
Make wedding programs. As with the invitations, you can you have your programs professionally printed or make your own. It’s not recommended that you print your programs much more than a week in advance in case there are any unexpected changes, such as changes in ushers or candle lighters. If possible, have your officiant proofread the ceremony portion of the program.

"
"
Choose your officiant.",How to Plan Your Wedding4," For a faith-based wedding, you'll be looking for a pastor, priest, minister or rabbi. If they don't charge a fee outright to perform the ceremony, be courteous enough to pay a generous gratuity for their time. For a secular based wedding, choose a wedding officiant, judge or person with authority to marry people who is both available on the date and amenable to any particular special requests you have by way of vows and ceremony.


Attend premarital counseling. This may take a large time commitment, but it is often worth it in the long-run. Be honest about your desires and expectations for marriage. Both faith-based and secular-based counseling is available.
If on a 12 month timeline, this is usually begun when there are about eight months to go.

"
"
Research, design and order your wedding dress.,
Select the wedding rings.",How to Plan Your Wedding5," Around the mark of nine months to go, start researching your wedding dress ideas. Are you having one custom made, altering an heirloom dress or purchasing off-the-rack? Whichever way, you'll possibly need several fittings and adjustments to perfect it. Alternatively, make your own or steer clear of traditional wedding dresses and buy a dress that you simply love and know you can wear again after the wedding. You don't have to stick with tradition or spend a fortune on something you'll never use again.


Select a wedding veil if you're having one. And don't forget the shoes––from flip flops to diamond encrusted satin slippers, what's your preference and do they need special effort or will you buy them ready-made?
Decide on bridesmaid's dresses at the same time. Are you paying for them or will they pay? You have less say over their choices if they pay but they're more likely to be happy with choosing their own style within your color choice.
In some religions, it is traditional that the mother of both the groom, and bride comes to find the dress, as well as the maid of honor. This varies widely depending on where you live and what your faith is.
Get tuxes and groomsmen clothing sorted and ordered about four months prior to the wedding. Send tux measurement forms to groomsmen a month before fittings.

, This is a fun task to do together, and symbolizes your devotion to each other. Most couples get matching rings to show that they complete one another's soul. If you're having rings specially made up, leave plenty of time and be prepared to get to learn more than you ever cared to know about gold and the origins of it (as in, whether or not it has been sourced equitably and so forth). Make the right decisions by doing your research.


Wedding ring selection should take place around five months before the wedding, with collection of the rings occurring about one month in advance of the date.

"
"
Find a photographer and/or a videographer.,
Hire your entertainment.",How to Plan Your Wedding6," Consider using a professional for this special occasion, and make sure that this person is reliable so that you don't have to worry about him or her forgetting your wedding or stuffing up the photos or filming. There are just too many stories of relying on friends or family to photograph or film a wedding followed by years of regret about the fuzzy, out-of-focus shots or no footage at all because the photographer got carried away doing something else...


Ask for recommendations from friends who have married recently who they'd recommend.
Ask to see portfolios at the business premises. This will give you a good idea of their abilities and style.

, Decide on whether you're going to have a quartet, orchestra, band or a DJ. Professional musicians will keep the flow of the event, make announcements, and plan all your special events with you. Each has its advantages and limitations depending on what you're seeking.


Music students at college/university level are definitely worth considering as they will be at the peak of their abilities and a lot cheaper than professional musicians, and many of them crave chances for a public performance.
This aspect should not be booked last, because all the good bands and wedding DJs get booked first! The entertainment is crucial and is what makes a wedding one to remember! It's recommended that you sort out this aspect of your wedding at least 10 months before the day.

"
"
Decide what type of food and refreshments you will offer at the reception dinner.,
Pick a cake.,
Register for gifts when there are about 9 months to go until your wedding.",How to Plan Your Wedding7," Try to find a happy medium between what would please your guests and what you can afford. Weigh the pros and cons of hiring a professional caterer, as it's not cheap, but it's one less thing you'll have to handle personally. Some couples choose to base the menu on the culture of the family, or go for something that most people like, such as Italian or Asian fusion.


Some people favor having a candy buffet as part of a wedding; this allows those with a sweet tooth to consume delicious sweets whenever they feel like.
At the same time as deciding on catering, make reservations for any additional rental/hire equipment needed, such as marquees, chairs, tables, dinnerware and flatware, linens, arches, etc.
Focus on this when there are at least 6 months left to go.

, Before settling on a cake it's best to have a tasting first. Also look into a cake that will match your theme, and please both the bride and groom. Sample cakes around eight months before the wedding and select the design at this time.


Check in on the baker again a few months prior to the wedding to be reassured that your order is still on the books and ready to go as planned.
It's best to have the cake delivered directly to the reception venue. Relying on a family member to do this places too much pressure on them and should it be dropped by anyone other than the responsible bakery, you have no recourse to a quick solution!

, This gives guests plenty of time to check your list and get the gifts.


Be realistic about gift pricing. Acknowledge the breadth of wealth by including very affordable through to more expensive items as part of the gift list. And also allow for non-gift list choices; some people really do not appreciate being forced to use one.

"
"
Make a budget and stick to it.,
Prioritize your ""must-haves"".,
Determine sources of funding.,
Make a comparison chart.",How to Plan an Inexpensive Wedding1," Set a total dollar amount that you and your partner are willing to spend. Be firm about sticking to that total amount (or go under it). You will inevitably find more fees and costs that you did not anticipate, so be sure to think through what you need to spend money on.


Aim to spend about half your budget on the venue, food and beverages.
Periodically review your budget as you plan. Of course you want to stay firm to your budget. But planning a wedding will mean you will have to adjust as you find out more information as you go along. Some expenses may be more expensive, or some things less so, or maybe you get help from friends and parents. ;
, There may be certain parts of your wedding that you feel you absolutely must have. You may be committed to a church wedding, for instance. Or you want your reception meal to be catered by your cousin. Talk with your partner to determine where you are both willing to compromise and where you are not going to bend., Are you financing the wedding yourselves, or will any family members be contributing to the overall budget? Many parents or other family members want to contribute money to a wedding. Determine who wants to give money and establish how much money it will be. Have a conversation about whether there are strings attached to accepting this money.


Some family members may want to chip in to pay for something specific, such as the photographer or the cake. This can be wonderful, but you can run into problems when everyone wants to dictate what you spend on certain aspects while often ignoring mundane expenses such as portable toilets for your wedding.
Be sure to give your benefactors reasonable and realistic estimates for their contribution, and respects any limits. Your grandmother may not realize how expensive a high-quality wedding cake is, for instance.

, Use a spreadsheet on your computer to make lists of different aspects of your wedding planning. This will make it easier to compare them for price and amenities, so you can see what the best deals are.This will also help you keep track of what to plan and when to complete tasks.

Determine the number of guests.,
Plan the cupcake decoration.,
Choose a tiered stand or an equivalent arrangement.,
Set your schedule.,
Bake your cupcakes.,
Choose the frosting (icing) flavor and texture to decorate the cupcakes.,
Arrange transportation for the cupcakes and stand.,
Assemble the cupcake wedding cake at the venue.,
Provide the opportunity for guests to take their cupcake(s) home.",How to Make a Cupcake Wedding Cake," It is very important not to underestimate this part; while not everyone will want a piece of traditional wedding cake, almost everyone will want a cupcake!


Do you want enough for guests to have one (or more) cupcakes at the wedding and one to take home?
Do you want a mini cake at the very top of the cupcake wedding cake? Some people like this as an added design feature for the bride and groom to keep after the wedding.;
, From a simple buttercream frosting to edible petals to inexpensive cupcake caps, you have lots of options. Do you want intricate designs on some of the cupcakes only, or on all? Do you want to mix and match designs? Think about the various possibilities. Some decorative designs to consider include:


Unique toppers that are just for the bride and groom.
A beloved symbol representing the bride and groom, such as doves, swans, or flowers.
Hearts and initials.
Floral designs.
Real flowers atop the frosting. (Be sure to use non-toxic flowers.)
Garden wedding designs.
Butterflies.
A fondant bow.
A fun photo of the bride and groom attached with a toothpick.

, There are lots of stands currently available, or you can simply choose to arrange the cupcake display as works best for you.


If using a stand, decide whether you want to buy or rent. If the cost is reasonable, consider purchasing it as you can use the stand again and again for tea parties, etc. Stands come in ceramic, plastic, acrylic, metal, etc.
Consider a round tier.
Consider a square tier.
Consider an ""in the round"" - a combination of using both stands and a round covered table for a larger wedding party.

, It is important to work out who will be responsible for preparing the cupcakes. Even if you are doing this yourself, only the cupcake itself can be frozen ahead; the decorations must be done very close to the wedding time -- is that something you are prepared to do at the last minute?


Consider whether it might be less stressful to have a family member(s) or friend(s) do it for you. You can sit down with the people responsible for preparing the cupcake wedding cake and talk them through the decorating, even show them what you want and provide photos of a test run. (Make a little photo instruction book that they can keep and follow.)
If you are going to do the baking, cupcakes freeze well (before decoration) and can be made a month out.

, Choose a cupcake recipe that you love and prepare it in advance of the wedding. Freeze if necessary. Some ideas for suitable wedding cupcakes include:


Plain cupcakes
Chocolate cupcakes
Lavender cupcakes
Smore cupcakes
Vegan cupcakes
Green tea cupcakes
Red velvet cupcakes
Apricot cupcakes
Ginger cupcakes
Black forest cupcakes
Pink lemonade cupcakes
Mixture of flavors.

, Cupcake frosting can be made in almost any flavor imaginable: vanilla, chocolate, banana, etc. Match the flavor with the cupcake.


Keeping in mind temperature and suitability for holding shape and decorative elements, decide on the type of frosting you would like to use:

Buttercream
Royal icing
Simple frosting
Fudge frosting
Whipped cream


Choose a color that matches with the theme of your wedding.

, More good news - cupcakes are much easier to transport than a wedding cake.


New, clean plastic sweater boxes/tubs are great for transporting, and they can usually hold about 40 cupcakes. These cost about US$5.
Decide whether or not you want the cupcakes wrapped in paper, as shown in this image. This can protect the cupcakes while still appearing pretty but it does change the appearance considerably.

, Once the cupcakes arrive, have someone arrange them in the correct order if you are not doing this yourself.


Provide clear instructions. This is where your precise instructions are very important, down to the last ribbon and floral piece! Use a photo book taken when you rehearsed the design to help those doing the decorating to get it right.
Consider well in advance whether you want flowers, lace, ribbon, figurines, signs, photos, etc., to form part of the overall wedding cake set up.
Don't forget to include some silver slides or tongs to help people take the cupcakes without touching the stand or bumping their hands against other cupcakes.

, If you have made enough cupcakes to allow guests to take one home, provide a carry container.


3"" x 3"" x 3"" (7.5 cm x 7.5 cm x 7.5 cm) gift boxes make your beautiful wedding cupcakes into a take home treat.

Plan a beach trip.,
Research hiking trails and outdoor island activities.,
Look into island tours.,
Plan time for water sports.,
Check vacation deal sites.",How to Plan Your Honeymoon in Bora Bora1," If you're honeymooning in Bora Bora, you'll want to pencil in lots of time at the beach. The most popular beach in Bora Bora is Matira Beach, where the water is crystal blue and the boardwalk is full of eateries, resorts, and souvenir shops.Look into lesser-known beaches if you want to avoid traffic.


If you or your partner love aquatic life, plan a trip to Bora Bora's Lagoonarium, a natural outdoor aquarium.;
, Bora Bora has plenty of hiking trails if you and your partner want an up-close look at the flora and fauna. The best-known hike in Bora Bora is climbing Mount Otemanu, one of the two extinct volcanoes in the center of the island.Hiking and climbing must be during Bora Bora's dry season, which begins in April and ends in October.Plan your honeymoon during these times if you want to hike.

, Bora Bora offers many different tours for those interested in the history and culture of the Tahitian island.Tours can be completed on foot or by vehicle depending on your needs. You can also participate in hiking tours if you want a guide while climbing on local trails.

, When you arrive at Bora Bora, you'll want to spend as much time as possible in the beautiful clear water. Depending on your interests, schedule one or two aquatic activities to do with your partner. Popular underwater excursions include snorkeling, jet skiing, and paddle boarding.If you or your partner are unable to do water sports, you can also go fishing or go on a boat tour. Popular game catches include blue marlin, mahi-mahi, and yellowfin tuna., Look for vacation packages and honeymoon deals months before you plan to go so you can spend less money. Before you begin scheduling and finalizing your honeymoon, look around at different websites so you can approximate how much your vacation will cost.


Groupon is a popular deal site that offers coupons on activities and hotels in Bora Bora. Look for Bora Bora vacation packages that offer many activities at a lower price.

"
Choose suitable transportation.",How to Plan Your Wedding8," If you have multiple venues, plan how you will travel from the ceremony location to the reception location. Some couples may choose to rent a limousine or ride in a classic car. Others like horse-drawn carriages. If it's popular with other people, book early. If it's your own cars, book them in for cleaning and detail a week before the wedding.


If there will be alcohol at the reception, do you have a safe way for you and your bridal party to get home? You may want to ask a friend or relative to be a designated driver for the night.
In some families it is traditional to decorate the couple’s vehicle, so if you have a nice car, you may want to keep it at home in the garage!

"
"
Decide on whether to have a special wedding night room or to leave on honeymoon quickly.,
Ensure out-of-town guests have accommodation.,
Research the honeymoon when there are about 6 months to go.",How to Plan Your Wedding9," Many couples book a honeymoon suite the night of their wedding to begin the feeling of a honeymoon before leaving the town or city of the wedding, while others simply get going straight after the wedding. The choice is entirely your own.

, You may need to reserve a block of rooms for guests that will be attending your wedding from interstate or overseas. Booking as a group will usually ensure they all get the best rate but this should be done well in advance of the wedding, at least four months in advance.


Make it clear whether you're footing the bill for guests or not. You can clarify that you've booked rooms at a special rate but expect them to cover the costs if need be. Be careful about expecting too much from far-traveled guests; they already have to fund their journey, so if you can reduce their accommodation costs, that's all the better.

, This will let you take advantage of any special deals and good prices. Book as soon as possible but always build flexibility into the bookings in case of the need for cancellation; it is better to pay a little more and get most of your money back if something prevents the travel (such as illness, postponing the wedding, etc.) than to get back nothing.

"
"
Plan the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner.",How to Plan Your Wedding10," This should be planned about five months before the wedding date, including booking the site for the rehearsal dinner. In addition, let those attending know early on that they're expected to be a part of rehearsals. These events are held within the week leading up to the wedding.


You may want to create a schedule for the bridal party for the day of the wedding, so that they know what time they need to be places for things such as hair appointments, photos, ceremony, etc.
Rehearsal dinners are a North American tradition that has begun to occur in other Anglo-speaking countries too. If you don't want to hold one, it's not essential.

Plan in advance.,
Plan for the off-season.,
Plan for a shorter wedding.,
Plan the wedding for yourself, not for everyone else.",How to Plan an Inexpensive Wedding2," Giving yourself several months to plan this event will give you more time to shop around for good deals, do your research, and create things like wedding invitations or sew your wedding dress. Booking things or shopping at the last minute may raise the cost of the total event.

, Plan a wedding that takes place before April or after October. Plan a wedding that does not take place on a Saturday.Venues and potentially caterers will be more expensive on Saturdays and in the summertime. If you plan your wedding to occur when weddings are few and far between – such as in the winter – you might find more reasonable rates.


Stay away from holiday weekends, as these are usually more expensive as well, no matter the time of year.
Mid-week weddings will likely be less expensive, but many friends and family members may not be able to participate in a wedding ceremony on a Wednesday. Or a winter storm may possibly mess up your February wedding in Quebec.

, Go for three hours instead of four or five hours. This saves on costs for labor, drinks, food, and so on. It is tempting to draw out the event, but avoiding long drawn-out ceremonies and receptions, you will also save on the overall cost. , Attempting to meet every expectation can quickly add to your overall costs. You may be blessed with a family that is nothing but helpful and supportive. More typically, friends and family will be a combination of support and unhelpful and even selfish. Be careful about ""bending over backwards"" to try to accommodate every guest to the extent that you blow your budget.


For example, in America many people have Memorial Day in May off and makes it easier to get to a wedding. However, because it is in spring and a major holiday, this is a prime booking time for weddings and usually more expensive. You may have to trade off a more affordable site fee for having more guests be able to come.
More food options often increase catering prices dramatically. For instance, a simple ""chicken or vegetarian"" menu option will be less expensive than a ""chicken, beef, vegetarian, fish, or lamb"" array. Also, more choices do not actually make guests happier.

"
"
Look into public spaces or parks.,
Hold the wedding at a private home.,
Hold the ceremony and reception at the same place.,
Hold the wedding in another town.,
Choose a beautiful venue.",How to Plan an Inexpensive Wedding3," Many parks, beaches, public gardens, and other public spaces may be free or inexpensively priced. Check with your city’s parks department to scope out suitable locations, fees and requirements.

, Maybe you like the idea of holding the wedding at your home. If someone close to you has a scenic home, a lovely garden, or is on the beach, consider asking if you can hold your wedding at their house. Of course, this can be asking a lot.


Be considerate of their home and yard, and any parking limitations, and how the number of guests you’re inviting will fit into the space.
Also, be aware of bathroom usage. Be aware of any water usage, septic, or just plain not enough bathrooms in the house.
Keep in mind things like parking, bathrooms and handicap accessibility. Make sure people are able to get to your wedding. Renting a portable toilet is an option if there are not enough bathrooms for the number of guests.

, If you rent one space instead of two, you will usually save money. Many venues, especially if they hold weddings frequently, are fully equipped to handle the ceremony and reception, and are able to make the switch easily between the two. , If you live in a city, venues may generally be more expensive. Move the celebration to a smaller town adjacent to your city and you might find that your costs decrease., By selecting a location that looks beautiful or interesting, such as an art museum, aquarium or manicured garden, you may not need much in the way of decorations. There may already be beautiful decorations or floral arrangements in the venue, which means you may not need to do as much for decorating.

Keep the bridal party small.,
Cut down the guest list.,
Anticipate who will likely decline an invitation.,
Choose a justice of the peace to conduct the ceremony.",How to Plan an Inexpensive Wedding4," All that is required is the happy couple and the person officiating the ceremony. You do not actually need twelve bridesmaids and groomsmen, a flower girl and a ring bearer. Perhaps you can choose just one attendant each for the bride and groom will cut down on costs--and really, these are still optional.

, Fewer guests means that you can book a smaller place and provide food for fewer people. Think about who you’d most like to share this occasion with.

, It can be a nice gesture to invite family or friends who live far away, even if it is unlikely they will attend. Think about who you should invite and who might decline the invitation. This will help with planning numbers. But keep in mind these faraway friends relatives may decide to come for the wedding. Many use it as a reason to take a holiday. So do not entirely count out ""courtesy invites""!

, Justices of the peace are judges of lower courts who are ordained to perform civil marriages..


Experienced or high-profile ministers, priests, rabbis and the like generally will cost more, charging $200-$400 or more to perform the service. Sometimes these fees are waived if you are part of the congregation, and your cleric knows you are struggling financially.
Justices of the peace charge often $50 to $100 for a simple ceremony. You may need to pay travel costs for the justice for them to get to your ceremony location.Some justices of the peace may only perform ceremonies at the city hall or county courthouse. Others may attend ceremonies at your preferred location. Some may be comfortable with unusual or non-traditional wedding ceremonies, and other may not be.

"
"
Wear a hand-me-down gown.,
Rent your wedding attire.,
Wear non-traditional wedding clothes.,
Get a dress that is not specifically sold as a wedding dress.",How to Plan an Inexpensive Wedding5," Increasingly, women are choosing to sell their used wedding gowns rather than save them forever. It may make more sense to buy and pass on. By doing so, you can save thousands of dollars. A talented seamstress can usually do alterations to fit your properly and styling options.


You may have dreams of having your daughter wear your gown, especially if it was expensive and you want to justify the cost. But you likely do not know if you will have a girl, that she will get married, will be a similar size, and would want to wear your dress simply because what is in fashion today may be tacky or hideous in twenty years.
Check out websites such as Craigslist.org to find used wedding dresses.
Some stores have pre-owned wedding dresses too, which are gently used dresses and which can cost as low as $100. When you consider that the average wedding dress is only worn once for a few hours, it can make a lot of sense to get one that is used.
There are some stores which accept wedding dress donations and then sell those dresses at a steep discount, donating the money made to a charity or cause.

, Check with a formal clothing rental store in your area. They may have wedding gowns and men’s suits for rent. Rented wedding dresses can range in price from $200 to $2,000, plus a damage deposit, and will be available for a few days before the wedding. Keep in mind, however, that you will likely not be able to alter this dress., If you are going for a less formal event, (such as a beach wedding) you might wear more casual or non-traditional clothing. Men might wear khaki pants and a button-down shirt and women might wear a white sundress with a simple veil.


Consider your footwear too. If you are getting married in the summer, for example, you might be able to get away with simple white flats, sandals or even flip-flops, if they match the aesthetic of your event.

, Wedding dresses in particular can be very expensive, but if you choose a dress that is not sold as a wedding dress, it can mean huge savings. An elegant white formal dress can be absolutely perfect.

Speak to your caterer.,
Find out the ingredients of the dishes served at the reception.,
Serve dishes using fruit and vegetables.,
Offer a gluten-free drink option.,
Place small signs indicating which dishes are gluten free.",How to Accommodate Wedding Guests with Dietary Restrictions1," If you’re having your wedding reception catered, contact your caterer and inform them that there will be gluten-free guests in attendance.Ask them to prepare at least one or two gluten-free dishes (e.g. one main and one side). Since going gluten-free is currently a popular dietary trend, the catering company will most likely be used to providing a gluten-free option.


If you do not have a caterer, but family members or friends are preparing the food for your wedding reception, you’ll need to have a similar conversation with them.;
, Ask your caterer (or the friends and family preparing the reception food) to provide a list of all ingredients used in preparation. This way, if wedding guests are unsure whether or not they can eat a certain dish, you’ll be able to inform them about the specific ingredients.Cooks and caterers who are not familiar with serving gluten-free food may accidentally include gluten in a dish. If you find out the list of ingredients ahead of time, you can warn the cooks and caterers and request that they remove the gluten.

, Since many popular wedding foods contain grains such as barley, wheat, and rye, it’s a smart idea to provide fruit and vegetables for your reception. Gluten-free guests will be able to eat these if nothing else.You could serve a seasonal fruit salad, or a vegetable-based salad, in addition to a more traditional Caesar salad.

, If you’ll be serving alcohol at the wedding reception, keep in mind that beer also contains gluten.If your gluten-free wedding guests are over 21 and plan to drink, either find a gluten-free beer to serve, or offer a wine option.


Ask your catering company what they usually do when bringing alcohol to a wedding that has some gluten-free guests attending.

, At the reception itself, you’ll need to signal to guests which dishes are gluten free and which contain meat or other animal byproducts. Do this by placing a small sign reading “Gluten Free” in front of the respective dishes.As is common practice, note “Chicken,” “Beef,” etc. in front of other dishes as well.


The catering company will likely provide these signs if they’re used to serving events with gluten-free guests.

Plan your honeymoon during Bora Bora's winter season.,
Talk to a French Polynesia travel consultant.,
Purchase flight tickets in advance.,
Consider renting an overwater bungalow for an authentic accommodation.,
Make reservations at a hotel for a more standard stay.,
Look into camping if you want to experience the wilderness.,
Think about renting a condo or apartment.",How to Plan Your Honeymoon in Bora Bora2," The best time to travel is during Bora Bora's winter, from April to October. In the winter, it rains less than in the summer and the air temperature is slightly cooler at around 80F (27C).The water temperature in Bora Bora remains constant year-round at 80F (26.6C). Even if you visit in Bora Bora's winter, the weather will likely be warm enough to visit the beach and engage in water activities.
If you're on a budget, consider scheduling your honeymoon during the off-season. From December to March, vacationer traffic in Bora Bora will be lower, and you may get cheaper deals on flights., You only have one honeymoon: talking with a travel agent can help you make sure you remember everything. Travel consultants familiar with Bora Bora will have insider knowledge and help you find the best accommodations for your money. If you're interested in taking the vacation road less traveled, consultants can also help you find little-known beauties to visit.


Honeymooners on a budget may feel hesitant about using a travel consultant, but travel agents often have contacts who can give you a better deal on flights and hotels. The price can end up being similar, but you'll get more for your value.

, To save money, research and buy flight tickets months in advance. The earlier you buy your tickets, the more you'll save. If you hired a travel consultant, ask them to help you locate flight tickets. They might know some cheap options.


Buy your tickets at least 2-3 months in advance. If you're planning to go during Bora Bora's busy season, buy your tickets during the off-season to avoid the rush.
To fly to Bora Bora, you must first purchase a ticket to Papeete, Tahiti. You can then fly from there to Bora Bora's only airport: Moto Mute airport.Plan in advance to buy both tickets so you're not left with sudden expenses when you reach Tahiti.

, Bora Bora is best known for its overwater bungalows, thatched huts on stilts that offer a clear view of the ocean and the perfect setting for a romantic getaway. Many couples plan their honeymoon in Bora Bora specifically for the overwater bungalows: to get the full Bora Bora experience, you and your partner may want to stay in one.


Overwater bungalows vary in price and quality. Talk with your travel agent or research different overwater bungalow resorts online to make your decision., Bora Bora also has plenty of hotels, if you are not interested in overwater bungalows.Most hotels offer complimentary breakfast and other amenities (such as bike rentals) for their guests. You and your partner might appreciate the extra support when staying in a foreign country.


Talk to your travel agent before making hotel reservations. They often have local contacts and can help you get a better deal.

, Bora Bora also offers campsites at a reduced price. If you and your partner love natural beauty, camping could be an inexpensive and enjoyable option for you. Bora Bora only has one campsite, so make reservations one or two months in advance to secure your spot., For couples on a budget, look for vacation rentals on websites like Airbnb or Couchsurfing. You may be able to find a house, condo, or other property rental to stay at for a fraction of the price. If you want the local experience, you can ask your host for recommendations on restaurants, sites, and nearby beaches.

Research transportation.,
Plan your meals.,
Learn basic French and Tahitian, the two languages spoken on Bora Bora.,
Pack lightly.,
Pack and finish preparations two to three weeks in advance.",How to Plan Your Honeymoon in Bora Bora3," Determine how you will get around in Bora Bora. Look into public transportation options near the airport or car rental rates before you leave. Bike rentals are especially popular in Bora Bora because the island is small enough to circumnavigate in an afternoon.


Many resorts or hotels offer deals on bike rentals or even offer complimentary ones for the duration of their stay.
Bora Bora's local bus system, Le Truck, is known for being unreliable. It is, however, very economical if you don't want to rent a car., Cuisine in Bora Bora can be expensive, so planning now can save your pocketbook from spontaneous expenses. Hotels often offer continental breakfasts: call ahead to know for sure.


To save money, eat only one meal a day from a restaurant, if possible. For the other two, shop at a convenience store or market for quick, easy meals. If you spend less on food, you can afford to see more while you're out.

, Many people, especially those who interact often with tourists, will have a good grasp of the English language. If you take the initiative to learn basic French and Tahitian, you will be able to interact more with locals and cultivate an authentic experience.


Don't worry about becoming fluent in either within a few months. Just set aside a little time each day to learn key phrases and conversation words in both of the languages. Locals will appreciate you taking initiative to learn their language.

, Take lightweight clothing made of breathable fabric so you don't feel hot or sweaty outside. Bright clothes will absorb the least amount of sun, so avoid darker fabrics. Although temperatures are generally warm, bring a light jacket and long pants for the nights (which can reach colder temperatures).


Bring at least two swimsuits. Much of Bora Bora's activities involve swimming or getting wet. You'll want two swimsuits so one can dry off while you wear the other.
Take comfortable walking shoes or sandals with you. If possible, bring shoes with non-slip or gripping soles. Your feet will thank you for your preparation after you've spent so much time in Bora Bora outdoors.
For sun protection, bring SPF 50+ sunscreen and a wide-brimmed hat.If you're going during Bora Bora's rainy season, take a raincoat and umbrella as well.

, You'll want to have time for last-minute wedding planning and devote your attention to your guests once the reception and open house begin. Plan to finish packing and planning at least two weeks in advance so you can set it aside and leave for your vacation after your wedding is over.

Pack your basics.",How to Prepare For Your Honeymoon," Maybe you’re both into hiking or you’re both into amusement parks, or maybe one of you likes the beach and the other prefers the mountains. Find someplace that has something for both of you, especially if your tastes differ. It can be a sweet gesture to choose the destination that your new spouse loves, but if there’s nothing there to interest you, it will be far less fun for both of you.;
, No matter how blissful you might be feeling, it’s hard to enjoy a vacation if the weather has you miserable, the lack of things to do is boring you out of your mind, or the tourist crowds are unbearable.


Assess the weather. If you’re getting married in a month of extreme heat or cold, you may want to find someplace more temperate to party. Check climate data websites to see what the average temperature is for the time of year you plan to visit.Travel during Shoulder Season—the period of time between peak and non-peak tourism dates. You might save quite a few pennies by coming in just after the high demand has gone, and not only will the pace be more laid back and enjoyable for you, you might find the locals friendlier and more welcoming when you’re not part of a mob of tourists.Delay your trip. Consider putting off your honeymoon for a few months if you’re getting married during your dream destination’s off season. This could have the side benefit of giving you more time to save.

, If you’re traveling in low season, or even Shoulder Season, some tourist destinations may have limited hours, or be closed altogether. The last thing you want to do is show up to a shut-down town. Consult the websites of the attractions you wish to visit to find a listing of their hours during your travel dates.

, While predicting the price of airfare can be difficult, most experts agree that purchasing your tickets around 60 days in advance will offer you the cheapest deals. Experts also suggest that ticket prices are now lowest on the weekends, so you should strive to purchase on a Saturday or Sunday.Start comparing airfare several months ahead of when you plan to purchase, so you can get a feel for fluctuations in cost for the flights you want to take. The more you pay attention to the average cost of your preferred flight, the more likely you are to recognize and snag a great deal.
Play around with flight options. Perhaps flights into or out of your destination city are cheaper on a different day, or a flight with one or more layovers is significantly cheaper than the nonstop version. Many airline websites allow you to look at price calendars to see which days are cheapest in the month you plan to travel.
Use a flight aggregator website or app to scour flight prices and options in one easy search. These sites look beyond what the larger airline travel sites offer, and often don’t charge a convenience fee, resulting in a more complete listing of less expensive choices. Beware, however, that some airlines don’t list on flight aggregators, and might offer a cheaper option to those who purchase through them directly., Avoid getting shut out in a booked-up city by reserving your room ahead of time. There is nothing fun or romantic about driving around, becoming more and more frustrated as you’re turned away from full hotels.


Weigh what is important to you when choosing a hotel. A nice room is a must, but it is also important to research location, transportation, safety, and accommodations outside of guest rooms. Hotel parking, internet, airport shuttle, proximity to attractions, and breakfasts are among things you should take into consideration when choosing your hotel.
Look for hotels that are centrally located to where you plan to spend most of your time. Shorter commutes can mean more time for fun!
Investigate big crowd events. Even a small convention, a sports game, or a parade can book up a city. If you want a quiet, romantic experience, make sure that your hotel isn’t hosting a prom or the venue for an army of rowdy convention-goers.

, Getting there is most important, but you must also consider how you’re going to get around while you’re there. You don’t want to waste time trying to figure out how a city’s subway works, or waiting for taxis in an off-the-beaten-path hotel.


Reserve a rental car. If your budget allows a little extra cash, rental cars are more comfortable and provide you with much more freedom and flexibility than public transportation. As with hotels, you want to research and make advance reservations for a rental car to get the cheapest and most convenient option.If you’re choosing public transportation, spend a little time before you leave studying subway maps and bus schedules so you’ll have an idea where you’re going before you get there. You can even calculate your anticipated fare costs and purchase subway and bus fare cards online before you go. Look up current taxi fare rates in your destination city to help budget for your trip., Reserve tour admissions and attraction tickets ahead of time whenever possible to avoid waiting in long ticket lines and to save a few dollars with online purchase-only discounts.

, Choose some nicer local restaurants you’d like to visit, then call or go online to see if they accept reservations. If they don't, ask if they have call-ahead seating.

, When in doubt, call the concierge at your hotel to see what dining and entertainment reservations they can secure for you. If they're unable to help you ahead of time, stop by their desk on your first day at the hotel.

, While a lavish, luxury vacation might sound enticing, remember that you have to come back to the real world when it’s over. You don’t want to start your new lives together with unnecessary debt. It can be easy to overspend with a charge card, and you could find yourself paying interest on that vacation long after the fun is over.Set up a vacation savings account that automatically deducts a few bucks from your paycheck is a practical way to save for your honeymoon. Disable online banking for that account—it can be easier to resist dipping into the funds for impulse spending when you have to physically go to the bank to withdraw money., Some experts recommend you spend no more than one week’s pay on any given vacation. Researching, making early reservations, and planning ahead will help you stay on budget.


Remember to include unexpected expenses, such as cold medicine, a visit to an urgent care, or replacement items due to lost luggage.
If you’re renting a car, remember to budget for parking, meter fares, and gasoline. If your hotel charges a parking fee, budget for that as well.
If you’re planning to use public transportation, budget for cab fare, bus fare, or subway fare. Don’t forget to budget for tips!

, They might be able to offer some cheaper travel packages than what you can find on your own. Be upfront with them about your spending limits, so you don’t get talked into something you can’t afford.

, If your dream hotel doesn’t appear to have any bookings available online, or if the rack rates are too high, call the hotel and ask if they can help you out. Front desk employees often know of discounts they can offer that aren't listed online.

, There are many cheaper ways to stay. Research all the available options in your destination’s area, including hostels, vacation rentals, B&Bs or even house swaps. You might just find a charming spot that is perfect for your romantic trip., Airports charge insanely high fees and taxes. The same rental car company in a nearby suburb might cost you much less.

, See if your destination city has a combination pass that includes discounted admission to local attractions, and search online for coupons or promo codes. Buy tickets online for discounted prices.

, Some couples choose to leave directly from their reception, while others wait a few days, a few weeks, or even a few months to work around employment demands, money shortage, or seasonal considerations.


If you have a lot of out-of-town family or friends attending your wedding, you may not want to leave in the middle of the reception, just when the party is getting good. This is especially true if those guests are bunking at your place.
Going home after your wedding to several days or weeks of routine life might feel like a letdown. Also, you might spend your first few days as a married couple stressing out about last minute travel details.

, Scientists at a Finnish university conducted a study and found that vacation happiness peaks at 8 days. Be sure to accommodate work needs, extended family needs, and holidays when making your length of stay decision., If you'll be leaving behind an empty house or apartment, find someone to take care of your things while you’re gone. Enlist a trusted friend or family member (perhaps your best man or maid of honor) to pick up your mail, turn your lights on and off, water your plants, and feed your pets. You don’t want to be worrying about what’s going on at home while you’re away.

, Pay special attention to TSA requirements if you’re flying, as well as customs requirements to get into and out of foreign countries you might be visiting.


If you’re traveling internationally, refer to the Consular Information Program, which will keep you up to date on any travel warnings, public health concerns, and provide you with information about passports, tourist visas, vaccinations and other details you need to know about your destination before you travel., Recent natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, or wildfires could render your destination a poor tourist choice, as could predicted weather events, such as hurricanes, blizzards, or sudden drops in temperature. Additionally, a recent terror event near your destination or at an airport or tourist attraction on your schedule could change your travel plans considerably.

, Have your plans in place several weeks before your big day. You don’t want to be handling the headache of travel arrangements on the day of—or even the week of—your wedding.

, Find a few moments to pack the basics several days before the wedding. This is especially easy if you’re planning to travel to somewhere that’s in a season opposite of where you live. After the stress and exhaustion of pulling off a wedding, it’s nice to be able to toss in a toothbrush and go.

Make your own invitations.,
Reduce the amount of inserts in the invitation.,
Send online invitations.",How to Plan an Inexpensive Wedding6," If you are crafty in any way, or you have a friend who is, designing your own invitations can be cost effective and reflect your personality. Design the invitations either by hand or on a computer using a desktop publishing program.


Consider photo ""Save the Date"" invitations and wedding invitations. Although these are not traditional wedding invitations, they can be perfect for an informal or creative wedding. Typically, they are far less expensive than traditional engraved invitations.
Purchase paper and envelopes at a paper supply store or art supply store. These stores typically have a large selection of paper colors, weights, and finishes., Instead of including printed out maps, lists of hotels or other pertinent information for guests, put this information on a blog. Then include a link to a website in your invitation. You can cut down on some of your invitation costs this way.


You can also request people to RSVP by sending you an email, rather than returning a card. This will eliminate the need to include stamped return envelopes with the invitations you send out.
Remember that not everyone has e-mail or access to the internet. Great-Grandpa may need someone to help keep him in communication about the wedding.

, For less formal weddings, you might choose to move everything online and send invitations online. Design an invitation and send it from your own email address, or use an invitation site like Evite.


Using an invitation website like Evite can help you keep track of RSVPs, since guests will RSVP through the website.
Not everyone has e-mail! Elderly relatives, especially, may not have e-mail or use it infrequently.

Ask family or friends to prepare food.,
It's not just about the food.,

Forgo the alcohol.,
Ask a friend to make your wedding cake.,
Buy wedding cakes at a grocery store.,
Plan a sit-down dinner where guests are served.,
Host an informal rehearsal dinner.",How to Plan an Inexpensive Wedding7," You do not need a gourmet chef in the family to produce good wedding food. If your have a capable family member or friend, see if you can enlist their help. Prepare a menu that is realistic with the skill, equipment, and budget they have access to.

, Remember plates, cutlery, cups, and napkins when doing it yourself. You will also need serving dishes and heating trays.


Check with your venue to make sure you can bring your own food at all. Some venues require that you use their catering services.

, Not all weddings have full sit-down dinners, and you should not feel obligated to serve a meal to your guests. Serving hors d’oeuvres and drinks is another way to cut down on costs. Or a dessert bar.

, Alcohol is probably the top expense in the food category, and your beverages budget can quickly run over once the wedding starts. Many guests often expect that alcohol will be served at a wedding, however. You will need to serve some kind of beverage at the wedding, but nonalcoholic drinks are much cheaper.


Alternately, supply your own alcohol. Buy it in bulk at a store such as Costco, for example. Check with your venue to make sure you are allowed to bring your own alcohol.
Some benefits of alcohol free weddings: you may be able to access more venues for the reception, and avoid any problems due to over-imbibing.
Do any of your friends or relatives home brew, or are an amateur vintner? Ask him or her if that could be a creative wedding gift to you.

, If you have a friend who is a skilled baker, ask them to bake your wedding cake. It does not need to be a multi-tiered cake; in fact, the fancy wedding cake is usually only eaten by the wedding party. In reality, guests are usually served from a sheet cake in the kitchen. Ask if a friend can bake several large cakes and decorate one cake with a fancy look.

, Grocery store bakeries often have excellent cakes that can be decorated to order. Work with the head baker at the grocery store to get the look you want for your cakes.


Pick up the cakes yourself. Instead of having them delivered to your venue, save some money by picking them up yourself. If it is a multi-tiered cake, make sure your vehicle will be tall enough!

, Sit-down dinners with each guest served a plate, rather than buffet style, is less expensive.This way, you can ensure that guests will not eat more than one portion, thus saving you money overall.

, Plan the rehearsal dinner in the afternoon as a barbecue or picnic or even ""pot-luck"" with informal food.

Skip the live music.,
Hire a local or amateur band.,
Make a compilation of reception music yourself.",How to Plan an Inexpensive Wedding8," There are many beautiful compositions of recorded wedding music available that can be played at the ceremony. Download some songs or play a CD at key moments during the ceremony.


Ask a friend or family member who is not in the wedding party to be in charge of the music for this part.

, Save money by hiring a local band that wants exposure and practice, rather than a more professional band that will cost more money. Meet with the band to go over your preferred types of music and listen to them play.

, If you’d like to play music during the reception, or have dancing at the reception, make a playlist of the music yourself. Make a list of must-have songs that you and your partner want to hear. Ask a friend or family member to keep tabs on the music to make sure it plays smoothly throughout the reception.


Back up the playlist by burning them onto a CD or putting them on a backup drive.

Ask a talented friend to take photos.,
Give your photographer a list of specific shots.,
Ask your photographer for a “shoot only” package.,
Put your guests to work.",How to Plan an Inexpensive Wedding9," If you have a friend who is skilled at taking portraits, ask if they would be willing to be your photographer. It’s a good idea to pay them some money for their work and their time, but you might be able to negotiate a lower fee.

, Give a shot list to the photographer to make sure they get all the photos you want in a short amount of time.You don’t have to hire a photographer for the entire wedding. Hire one for the ceremony and part of the reception to capture the essence of the event.

, Don’t ask for prints of your photos from the photographer. This is a “shoot only” package, where the photographer will just take pictures and give you either proofs or a CD of the images.

, Give disposable cameras to the guests and have them take pictures during the reception. This strategy often gives you a really unique perspective on your wedding, as you will get a nice array of photos that feature all of your guests, not just a handful that a photographer might focus on.

Let the venue be the decoration.,
Get crafty!,
Shop around for flowers.,
Use candles instead of flowers.,
Dollar stores can be a great source of wedding decorating supplies.,
Hang holiday lights.",How to Plan an Inexpensive Wedding10," Holding your wedding at a beautiful location may enable you to replace decorations with scenery. An art gallery, aquarium or even an outdoor setting can be the perfect backdrop to the wedding, reducing the need for elaborate decorations.

, If you happen to have a talent for making crafts, weddings are a great opportunity to save money by crafting yourself. For example:


Large satin bows are easy to make, and make great simple decorations.
Are you a gardener? Consider growing flowers for your tabletop decorations.
Can Nana sew? If she is a skilled seamstress, maybe she could sew your dress. If she is capable but not at expert, things like chair covers can be easy projects.
Many websites offer great wedding craft ideas, as well as sites like Pinterest.com.

, Visit multiple florists to shop around for flower arrangements. Request flowers that are in season and native to your area instead of exotic arrangements that are expensive or out of season. There are also flowers that are just normally less expensive, such as carnations and daisies.


Alternately, buy flowers in bulk; Costco, for example, has flowers for purchase. Arrange the flowers yourself.
Also consider live plants. Pretty pots of daisies on the reception hall tables can be just as attractive as cut flowers.

, Candle arrangements, even in combination with some flowers, can greatly reduce your costs.Be sure to carefully enclose the candles or arrange them so that they don’t catch anything on fire.

, Talk to the manager if you are buying a large lot of goods; he or she may be able to give you a further discount. For wedding basics, dollar stores can be a great resource of party, crafts, and paper goods, including:


Candles, both regular and battery operated.
Glass vases (great for table arrangements)
Craft stones, such as ""river rock"" and glass pebbles.
Balloons
Ribbon, tulle, and bows.
Gift bags, tissue, and other items for gift-giving.
Picture frames
Poster board, glue, tape, markers, and other supplies for signs, decorations, and more.
Creative decorations. Dollar stores are full of surprises!

, If you are having an evening wedding, achieve a romantic, soft look by hanging holiday lights around the venue. Stock up on extra lights when they go on sale after holidays such as Christmas.Be sure to tuck away any extension cords or run them underneath rugs so that guests don’t trip on cords.
Do not overload circuits and extension cords!

Plan to serve a vegan entrée.,
Tell caterers that guests have dairy or egg allergies.,
Indicate to guests which dishes are vegan.",How to Accommodate Wedding Guests with Dietary Restrictions2," If you have one or more vegan guests attending the wedding reception, you can accommodate them by serving a fully vegan entree—or at least a few vegan hors d’oeuvres. Coordinate this with your caterer or the individuals preparing the food for the wedding. Pasta and vegetable dishes are common vegan options at wedding receptions.When eating large, catered meals, vegans often get stuck having to eat salad or a bland plate of vegetables in place of a full meal. If you serve a vegan entrée, vegans will be able to have a more interesting meal.

, If you’re concerned that caterers won’t take seriously the request to have vegan food served, you can tell them that guests have dairy or egg allergies. Catering companies will take these statements more seriously.You could suggest that, in order to accommodate these alleged allergies, caterers make an entrée using ingredients tofu and almond milk.
If you’re serving coffee, plan to serve either soy, rice, or almond milk in addition to regular dairy milk for guests to add to their coffee.

, As when accommodating other dietary restrictions, if you’re serving food buffet-style, you’ll need a way to inform your vegan guests which dishes they can consume. Do this by printing out small cards that read “Vegetarian” or “Vegan,” respectively. This will save guests from confusion, and save you from having to answer many redundant questions concerning which dishes are or are not vegan.If members of the catering staff will be manning the buffet table, make sure that they also know which dishes are gluten free.
If the catering wait staff are bringing the plates directly to seated guests, the staff should have a full list of which guests require a vegan meal.

"

Inform your caterer about any guests with nut allergies.,
Provide a kosher meal option.,
Accommodate lactose intolerant guests.",How to Accommodate Wedding Guests with Dietary Restrictions3," To accommodate nut allergies, you’ll need to ask the caterer to serve an entrée that does not contain nuts. While this is relatively simple, the entrees for guests with nut allergies will need to be prepared and plated separately. Stress to the wait staff the importance of keeping these dishes completely separate from any meals or food supplies that have contacted or contain nuts.Nut allergies can be very serious; individuals allergic to nuts can have severe allergic reactions, and nut allergies are occasionally fatal. Unlike some other dietary preferences, there can be serious consequences for not accommodating a nut allergy.

, If you have kosher guests coming to the wedding, you’ll need to provide at least one kosher side or main dish. Coordinate this with the reception caterer, or the family members preparing the food. If a large number of your wedding guests are kosher, you may need to contact a separate catering service that specializes in serving kosher dishes.Kosher food laws are complex, but commonly eaten non-kosher foods include pork (or any pig meat) and many types of fowl. Kosher laws also require that food be prepared in specific ways., This is a relatively simple dietary restriction to avoid, although milk and its byproducts are present in a surprising number of foods. Check with your caterers or other individuals preparing the food, and make sure that there are at least one or two food options that do not include any dairy.


Non-dairy dishes will need to include no cream, cheese, or milk, and should be handled and plated away from dishes which contain dairy.

",How to Save Money on Honeymoon Travel," Many tropical locations have ideal weather year-round, but rates soar upwards when cold climate residents are looking to escape the winter blues. If you want to hop on a flight immediately following your wedding, consider booking your honeymoon travel arrangements at an off-season location; if you have your mind set on a particular destination, be flexible with your either your wedding date or your departure date to reap big savings.;
, Travel agents provide all sorts of money-saving expertise and can often access on-going sales or last-minute deals on honeymoon travel. They'll work with you to find the best vacation packages to suit your preferences and budget.

, Start thinking about your vacation once you have established a wedding date, and keep your eyes peeled for deals posted online or in the paper. Give yourself plenty of time to comparison shop.

, Start charging your wedding-day expenses, and cash in on the bonuses for airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, and other upgrades. Be careful here though; you should be able to pay off all expenditures at the end of every month to avoid finance charges and racked up debt. Also be sure to check black-out dates before making your travel arrangements.

, While all-inclusive resorts once carried a negative connotation with ""mandatory fun"" activities, their inclusive honeymoon packages afford you the luxury of a flat-rate and a carefree experience. Bed and breakfasts, on the other hand, offer romantic retreats at typically affordable prices, but can lack exclusive privacy. The point here is that you should do your research, discuss the types of honeymoon vacations available with your fiancé, and decide which priorities take precedence. Our guide to honeymoon accommodations can help you weight the options.

, Research conducted by Caxton FX, found customers would be €60* worse off if they bought euros at an airport rather than getting a prepaid currency card.

Stay domestic.,
Pick a lesser-known destination.,
Opt for a staycation.,
Go camping.",How to Plan a Honeymoon on a Budget1," Domestic travel is often more affordable since you do not have to worry about international taxes and fees. Look at destinations within your home nation to save on international flight prices and taxes.If you are in the US, for example, you could consider destinations like Hawaii or the Florida Keys for a tropical escape, or cities like New York or Chicago for an urban adventure.
Look at territories, as well. Flights from major US cities to Puerto Rico, for example, are often affordable because no international taxes are involved.
If you have airlines rewards miles, cash them in to see where they can get you. Don't sign up for a rewards card, though, just to get miles for your honeymoon, as this can promote debt elsewhere.;
, Popular destinations such as Jamaica, Costa Rica, and Western Europe are routinely more expensive because of the constant influx of tourist traffic. Research alternative destinations with the features or climate you want to find lower prices.Check travel guides online and in print to review activities, climate, and costs of different destinations.
If you want a honeymoon in a city like Paris with old world charm, for example, look at Canada’s Quebec city, which has a wealth of charming French food, architecture, language, and customs for a fraction of the cost.
If you want a tropical island vacation, instead of planning a trip to sovereign island nations in the Caribbean, look at coastal islands in Brazil and Colombia, which are often much more affordable., Instead of traveling a great distance for your honeymoon, stay nearby and save substantially on the cost of travel. You may choose to get a hotel in the city for a few days, or a cabin out in the country. Just pick a nearby place to unwind and relax after your wedding.By eliminating the cost of travel, you can put more of your budget toward accommodations and activities.
Think about your favorite places and activities in the areas near you. Are there beaches, hiking trails, museums, restaurants, or other activities that you want to share with your new spouse?
Alternatively, you can opt to find nice, well-appointed accommodations such as a hotel and spa or mountain lodge and spend your time relaxing and unwinding on property.

, Camping is an affordable way to connect with your new spouse and take on an adventure together. Look at national parks, nature preserves, and areas like forests, lakes, and beaches to find campgrounds that are affordable and easily accessible for you.Camping offers you and your spouse the chance to spend some time alone talking and bonding, as well as exploring nature and taking on adventurous activities such as hiking and kayaking together.
If tents and communal showers aren’t your idea of a honeymoon, you can also look at “glamping” properties. These often cost a bit more, but offer more luxury accommodations such as beds, electricity, and private hot-water showers.

To start being socially conscious on your honeymoon, begin when planning your wedding. Have a honeymoon registry in place instead. You can request donations for your trip or items you will actually use.You can use websites, such as Honeyfund and Buy Our Honeymoon, to take donations. Let guests know you would prefer this over physical gifts.
If you have a gift registration, try requesting gifts you will actually use on your honeymoon. For example, ask for things like cameras and hiking boots. This way, items you receive will not go to waste.;
, While travel agencies are somewhat dated, eco-tourist travel agencies are a version of travel agencies that are still around. An eco-tourist travel agent can help you and your partner plan a trip that minimizes your carbon footprint.If you can't find an agent in your area, use one online. With things like video chatting, it's easy to plan a trip using an agent through the internet.
Let the agent know the specific ways you want to be socially conscious. In addition to minimizing harm to the environment, talk about how to respect local cultures and support local businesses as well.

, Giving back to your own community is very socially conscious. Also, if you don't travel very far, you will not use up as much fossil fuel. As an added bonus, a local honeymoon can save you money.Think about what you enjoy around your town, but often do not have time for. Maybe you never take advantage of local hiking trails, for example. Honeymooning at home can give you this opportunity.
You do not have to stay in your home for a honeymoon, however. If you want to feel like you're truly vacationing, stay at a local hotel. This will support local businesses in your community as you give yourself a treat.

, If you're the outdoors type, camping can be a great way to have a socially conscious honeymoon. You will not have to spend money and resources on a hotel and can enjoy the great outdoors.See if you live near any national parks and check camping regulations. You and your partner could go on a camping trip through a park and enjoy long hikes each day.
When choosing camping supplies, always read the materials list. Make sure you're not buying supplies made with heavy use of plastic or chemicals.

, Where you choose to stay matters when it comes to being socially conscious. Make sure you pick hotels and other places to stay that are committed to social awareness.Support local businesses whenever possible. Instead of staying in a chain hotel, for example, look for a local bed and breakfast.
If you do end up going the hotel route, check to make sure the hotel is environmentally friendly. Websites like treehugger.com and greenhotels.com provide guidance on choosing green hotels in a variety of locations.

, Airplanes have a huge impact on the environment. If you want to travel in a way that minimizes your carbon footprint, opt for transportation such as trains and busses. A long train ride with your partner can feel romantic and cozy, as opposed to the stress of an airport and flight., When you're at your destination, look into local public transportation options. This will help you reduce your carbon footprint while you're traveling.Check out things like bus routes and subway routes.
If an area is pedestrian friendly, walk whenever you can. You may enjoy getting a few miles of walking in each day, and this can help keep you fit while on vacation.

, If you end up flying somewhere, ask yourself whether you really need a car. Many big cities are easy to navigate biking. If you, say, spend your honeymoon in Paris, try renting a couple of bikes to tour the city. This is cheaper than renting a car or taking taxis.Make sure you practice basic safety with bikes. Read up on the rules for biking in the street in your destination and always wear a helmet.

, Always be on the lookout for routes that do not require a lot of carbon energy. For example, see if you can take a shuttle or train from your airport instead of getting a cab. If a destination is reasonable walking distance, walk instead of getting on the bus. A few small tweaks here and there can minimize your reliance on fossil fuels during your trip., You should always make sure the products you use are eco-friendly. Look for sustainable, organic materials whenever possible.Bring environmentally friendly products with you. For example, bring eco-friendly sunscreen, soap, clothing, and so on.
If you need to purchase something on your trip, watch where you shop. Look for free trade stores that sell locally made organic products.

, Avoid activities that contribute to carbon emissions. Stick to things that are powered by wind or people. You can try things like sailing, snorkeling, or paddle boarding.You can also enjoy the outdoors by doing things like hiking and stargazing.
Instead of taking a cab for public transportation, try taking a bike taxi around the city.
Opt for walking tours over bus tours.

, Be conscious of your culture when you're traveling. You do not want to offend those who live in the areas you're visiting. Read up on local customs and laws before embarking on your trip.Read about local culture ahead of time. Google the area you're visiting as well as words like ""customs and culture.""
This is especially important if you're traveling to another country. It may be considered rude or odd to hug people in some places and certain items of clothing may be offensive.

, Whenever possible, support the community you're visiting. Stop by local farmer's markets and independent grocery stores. Eat at locally owned restaurants instead of chains. Not only will this support the local culture, you'll be able to try a variety of new cuisines."

Tip the staff.",How to Get Free Honeymoon Upgrades," If you have a preferred airline, sign up for its frequent flier miles program as soon as you can, especially if you take a lot of business trips. Frequent flier miles can add up quickly and lead to free tickets and upgrades.

Some airlines even allow your friends and family to gift you their miles, so encourage them to sign up, too.;
, Many credit card companies offer reward programs that give you frequent flier miles based on how much you spend. Some credit card programs even offer other travel-friendly perks like free, full-coverage car rental insurance.Talk with credit card companies before you start planning your wedding and sign-up for incentives as soon as possible. That way, you can use all of your charged wedding expenses to help provide upgrades for your honeymoon!

, Resorts, cruise lines, and hotels value loyalty, so by signing up for hotel club or membership cards, you’re likely to automatically qualify for free nights or better rooms with a certain length of stay. Perks may also include free services, like airport shuttles, along with free or discounted activities.

, There are many online travel companies and direct businesses that offer general coupons during booking. Complete a general search based on the destinations you are interested in and be sure to look up specific activities.


Be sure to check expiration dates and any fine print on the coupons.
Try searches with and without the terms “honeymoon” in them. Some places offer discounts or special incentives for honeymooners, while others increase the price because of high demand.

, You’re more likely to get better rates and free upgrades when you book flights and hotels in destinations where it’s considered the “off-season.” Although the timing may not be as popular, visiting Iceland in early spring, Paris in winter, or Hawaii in summer will likely get you some great deals because demand is low.Another perk to off-season travel is that you can enjoy destinations in peace and quiet, which makes for especially nice, crowd-free pictures!

, Although booking a honeymoon yourself is usually the most economical, inquire with a travel agent about honeymoon packages and deals. The travel agency may offer special booking promotions with prices you can’t beat yourself, or the agent may know the best places to honeymoon with the most perks and incentives simply based on prior booking experience., When you make reservations in person over the phone, you have the chance to mention your honeymoon and ask about upgrades. Be friendly with the people that answer and make small talk.For example, ask how the person's day is going, talk about how excited you are for your honeymoon, and share a bit about your plans.
Next, tell the person that you want to make your trip special for your spouse and ask if there are any upgrades offered to honeymooners.
Sound as kind, excited, and friendly as you can. If you assume you’re eligible or if you sound entitled, you’re likely to be refused.

, When you decide on the restaurants you’d like to try during your honeymoon, call ahead to make a reservation, even if the restaurant doesn’t take reservations! It’s a good way to introduce your circumstances, ask about perks (like free or customized dessert), or simply request the best table and ask the hostess if she could make a note of it before you arrive.When you request a reservation, add some detail like, ""This dinner will be for the first night of your honeymoon! Is there any chance we could get some candlelight at our table and maybe a celebratory dessert? It would make the evening so special.""

, If you need a rental car for your honeymoon, book a compact car and book it early. If you call by phone, you can mention your honeymoon status right away to ask for perks. Compact cars are usually in high demand, so when you arrive at the rental booth for pick up, chances are the company may have to offer you a bigger and better car because all the compacts are taken.When you call for a rental car, try saying something like, ""I'd like to reserve a compact car for our honeymoon. I am trying to make every aspect of our honeymoon extra special - do you offer any sort of perks or incentives for special occasions, like honeymoons?""

, Although you’re officially on vacation, it’s important to dress appropriately and to look presentable. What you wear should be dependent on what upgrades you are hoping for.For example, don’t show up in pajamas if you want to qualify for first class seats on the airplane or get ushered into the honeymoon suite at a fancy hotel.

, People love to see other people happy and in love. If you’re squabbling at dinner, arguing about luggage tags in the airport check-in line, or looking generally unimpressed with each other, you’re less likely to catch anyone’s favor for upgrades.

Show off your wedded bliss by showing lots of affection to one another, smiling lots, holding hands, and laughing.

, Although it’s not standard for companies to ask for proof of marriage for honeymoon upgrades, it can’t hurt to bring along a copy of your marriage license or certificate, just in case., If you have flexible honeymoon plans, pay attention to “over-sold” announcements at the airport. Airlines will often reward you with free flights and travel vouchers if you’re willing to give up your scheduled seats and wait for the next plane., Some of the best upgrades are available at the last minute. As you start your honeymoon, be sure to mention it whenever you encounter staff and ask what upgrades might be available.When you arrive at the airport, mention your honeymoon at the ticket counter, the check-in counter, and to the on-board stewardess, once you’re seated. If you time your boarding with the pilot crew, you may even be able let them know, too.
If you or your partner feel shy about mentioning it all the time, try dressing up in “bride and groom” or honeymoon shirts so that it’s easy for others to notice and hopefully take initiative., It’s okay to ask for or suggest upgrades for your honeymoon, but don’t insist, pester, or expect them. Sometimes, it’s just not possible for staff to accommodate upgrade requests, and it’s important to trust that they are doing everything they can to make your experience memorable.

Even if you are denied the upgrades you want, be sure to say thank you.

, Gather small items or leftover wedding favors that you can give to flight attendants, hotel staff, cab drivers, and other staff as celebration favors for your honeymoon. The gifts will make them feel included in your celebration and potentially entice them to provide perks and upgrades.

Gift ideas include small boxes of chocolates, small scented candles, luxury soaps, or unique spice packs.
These small gifts should not be given in lieu of cash tips for restaurant servers, tour guides, taxi cabs, and other ways monetary tips are standard for service.

, Everyone loves free upgrades, and a honeymoon is a good excuse for them. Most companies are immune from extra costs that accompany upgrades and incentives, but the staff that help facilitate them still have to put forth the extra effort. It’s important to tip the staff that go out of their way to help make your honeymoon special.

Flight staff can lose their jobs if they accept tips, so instead of money, bring chocolates or small gifts as a token of your appreciation.

Find an all-inclusive resort.,
Check deal sites.",How to Plan a Honeymoon on a Budget2," Instead of staying at a resort or hotel, look on sites like Airbnb and FlipKey.These let you find houses, apartments, and other unique property rentals, often for less money than a hotel.You can opt to rent anything from a private room to the entire property, and generally get access to amenities such as a kitchen and laundry as well as a bedroom and bathroom.
These sites also occasionally feature unique rental properties such as tree houses, trailers, remodeled planes, and ships, if you are looking for something to make your trip more memorable.
When you choose a vacation rental, you can often get recommendations for places to eat and drink as well as things to do from your host. You may even be able to arrange a tour of the area with them.

, In certain destinations, particularly in Caribbean islands and South Pacific, all-inclusive resorts allow you the chance to pay a single price for everything including your meals, drinks, and certain selected activities. Deals on all-inclusive packages can often be found online.Before you book, check online or call the hotel to see what is included with your price. While some properties include only the rooms, meals, and access to the property, others may include activities such as snorkeling and diving as well as spa services.
All-inclusive resorts generally do not include activities off of the property, so if you are looking to explore around the area, budget that as an additional cost.

, Online deal sites such as Groupon often feature deals on hotels and vacation packages. Shop around online to find deals on both your accommodations and activities for your honeymoon.Some deal sites offer bargains on full vacation packages that include hotel, flight, and certain tours or planned activities, as well as hotel deals.
You can also contact hotels directly with prices quoted from deal sites for their hotel or for nearby hotels, and see if you can get them to bargain down from there.

, While it’s advisable to avoid monsoon and hurricane seasons, many places simply have a high and a low season based on tourist traffic patterns. Look into the low season for your destination and book then to save on flights and hotels.Many Caribbean islands, for example, have a high season from December through April due to cold North Americans wanting to escape the winter. Book in the late spring or early fall for better prices.
Europe, on the other hand, generally experiences the greatest number of tourists in the summer and immediately around Christmas. Book a winter or early spring trip for major savings.

, The sooner you start planning, the better prepared you will be when it comes time to book. Start planning one to two years in advance, if possible, to track flight and hotel prices and find the best time to book.Do not wait to book until the last minute. The closer to departure you get, the more the price of flights, trains, hotels, and activities will go up.

, Look at budget airlines, trains, and busses to get the most affordable ticket to your destination. If you have to fly, look at airports further out from your destination. These often are home to budget carriers which offer cheaper service.You may also want to consider driving to your destination. This could offer an affordable alternative to flying or taking a train, and give you and your partner a chance to take a roadtrip together.

, Meals are often a large and overlooked expense during a honeymoon. Plan where you are going to eat in advance so that you can set a reasonable budget for going out.


Treat yourself to one or two truly nice meals, such as a sunset dinner or gourmet breakfast, and opt to dine at more casual restaurants such as cafes and diners the rest of the time.
You can also cook for yourself if you have an apartment rental, or prepare no-cooking needed meals like salads and sandwiches from your hotel. Pack a romantic picnic for the beach to save money and still make a memory.

, Save money on your honeymoon by saving money for your honeymoon. Instead of taking it immediately after your wedding, which likely had its own heavy costs associated with it, plan to take your honeymoon at a later time, such as your one year anniversary.Create a savings plan such as putting ten percent of each paycheck or $100 a month toward your honeymoon during that period of time.
Review destinations and costs and start planning in advance during this period to get the best deals.

Put heavy items at the bottom of the bag.,
Roll clothes to maximize space.,
Place toiletries in a separate lined bag or pocket of the suitcase.,
Pack a carry-on bag.",How to Pack For Your Honeymoon2," Give yourself plenty of time to pack and don’t try to do it all at the last minute.

This will allow you to make sure that you have all of the clothes you want to pack and that they are clean.


This will also give you time to purchase any items you may need prior to the trip.

You can choose a soft suitcase with straps, extendable handles, and wheels to make make transportation easier.Soft suitcases come in a variety of sizes, so choose one that can fit everything you will be packing.

, Hard shell suitcases are extremely light and easy to transport. They come in a variety of sizes and styles. Also, their hard sides work well to protect breakable items from being crushed during travel and they are easier to clean than fabric suitcases.


Research possible restrictions, such as baggage weight and size, as well as the number of bags allowed to help you determine the type of suitcase to pack., Items like shoes or books should go at the bottom to avoid squishing other items. If it is a stand up suitcase try to also put them on the side that will be at the bottom when the bag is vertical., Lay clothing on a flat surface and smooth out any wrinkles. Then roll clothes from one end to the other, creating a tube like shape. When clothes are rolled like this they take up less space in your luggage and it reduces wrinkles in some fabrics.


Larger clothing, like dresses or pants can be laid out flat, to keep them from wrinkling.
Socks and underwear can be placed in a separate bag to keep them all together, or they can be tucked inside other items, like shoes, to conserve space.

, This will protect your clothes from any potential leaks and keep these items organized in a central location., When travelling by airplane you will want to pack a bag to take on the plane with you.

Discuss your honeymoon plans.,
mid- April, higher Spring Break pricing will prevail.,
Discuss where you would like to go, and talk about how long you are willing to travel to get there.,

,
Consider an inclusive resort to really get the most for your money, but remember, not all All Inclusive Resorts are created equal.",How to Plan Your Honeymoon," Take the time to discuss with your future spouse what the two of you would like. Plan something that fits your budget and that you both can agree on. Compromise, because this is a trip about both of you.


Fall is the least expensive time of year to travel. Travel deals are easiest to find in the Fall because just about every destination is ""On Sale"" in the Fall. Once Labor Day hits, the tourist season winds down and stays slow until Christmas.
Travel when it's least expensive. To avoid paying the most for your trip, avoid the week between Christmas and New Year's. Starting about December 16th and until January 3rd, the rates are highest for ""Fun in the Sun"" places, and ski destinations. The next time to avoid: The week leading up to Easter Sunday - almost as bad as Christmas for getting ""gouged"" on the price. Spring Break happens at different times throughout the world, from about the mid-March to;
, Also, avoid Thanksgiving week like the plague. If planning a short getaway, avoid all government holidays, such as Columbus Day and President's Day. Due to the number of federal employees that get this time off, demand is higher and prices rise.


Pick ""hidden holidays"" for traveling, especially since you might want to be away from the touristy crowds on your honeymoon! Not all holidays drive up the price of travel. There are even some that are ideal to travel since pricing is lower than normal. When you think a bit about people's habits, it starts to make sense. The week of Memorial Day is a good one. It's the first BBQ holiday of the year and most people want to stay home and gather with friends and family. Mother's Day and Father's Day are slow travel weekends, because being away keeps lots of people home forcing hotels and airlines to reduce prices to induce people to leave loved ones behind. Labor Day weekend is THE best holiday weekend for finding a bargain in travel, since the focus is on ""back to school.""

, If you dream about going ""somewhere different, that not every one else has gone to for their honeymoon,"" there is a reason why. Such places are always harder to reach from where you live and require a commitment to spend additional time traveling to get there. Are you committed enough to your dream destination to take a connecting flight? Are you committed enough to spend 12 or 14 hours getting to this place? With all the cutbacks in flights, the number of nonstop schedules have dwindled making it much harder to get to ""some place different.""

, You can get off the well-worn path and delve into nearby areas that offer the unique and unusual setting you crave, and all for a lot less than you'd pay for places that take an entire day to reach. For example, one of the easiest beach destinations to reach is Cancun, Mexico, but for many, it's not unusual enough. Consider flying into Cancun and taking the ferry to the island of Isla Mujeres to stay at a resort that can only be reached by boat.

, Some good ideas are bike tours around the city, so you can even go to the less-explored or reachable areas, pottery or sculpting classes and even home-run cooking classes or dining with locals., You only want to plan one honeymoon, so make sure you do it right. A good travel consultant will seldom cost more than if you ""do-it-yourself,"" but can often save you money. They have an insider's knowledge about the fares and deals that are circulating around. They know how to get you ""wholesale"" prices for your honeymoon. They have contacts for problem resolutions that you are not likely to have. They know the places to avoid and the places that are the best in their category. A good Travel Consultant wears many hats on your behalf. They act as a personal shopper, your accountant, and sometimes even a therapist when you need a shoulder to cry on!

,, You will find they range from the most basic (3 squares and a hot shower)to limited gourmet dining and then to unlimited luxury where every possible option is yours to enjoy. Note: Some of the most heavily advertised All Inclusive Resorts are not the best deal or the best resorts. They just spend a lot to make themselves seem like they are. There are many hidden fees that your travel consultant knows about and can recommend to save you money and give you the best honeymoon possible!

Decide what activities you would like to do, including sightseeing, hiking, train travel, bike travel, local farm visits, snorkeling, swimming and more.


Most eco-friendly honeymoons embrace the natural environment. Ecolodges and resorts are often near wildlife preserves or in places where you do not need to travel by car, boat or plane to see the sights. Consider whether a trip to a beautiful, but wild place is something that you and your fiancé would like.;
, The most eco-friendly travel decision is to avoid getting on a plane. Choose a resort or spa with a commitment to green practices within a day's drive from your house or wedding.

, There are currently ecotourism lodges and resorts in many countries. However, the following are some popular choices for green honeymoon travel:


Consider registering for a service project at the Maya Biosphere Reserve in the Petén Region in Guatemala, in the Upper Guinean Forest in Ghana Madidi, at a rain forest research project in Costa Rica or Belize or in a National Park in Bolivia.
Visit an ecoresort in the Caribbean. Good choices include the Maho Bay Camp, St. John, Virgin Islands or the Jungle Bay Resort in Dominica.
Travel to an eco-lodge in South America. The Yacutinga Lodge in Argentina and Jicaro Island Ecolodge in Granada Isletas, Nicaragua are popular choices.
Choose a Six Senses Spa location in Southeast Asia or Europe. There are 35 choices of locations that are committed to sustainable lodging.
Choose a hiking or camping adventure in a national park in the United States or Central America. Backpacking or camping allow you to spend plenty of time secluded with your new spouse, but most activities are based on hiking, biking and camp cooking. Visit Glacier, Yellowstone, Yosemite or another National Park.

, Planes burn as much carbon per person per flight as it takes 1 full grown tree to process in a year.

, Go to artemisair.com/emptylegs to see if a charter flight company is planning on flying home from a destination without passengers. Perhaps you can catch a private, relatively cheap charter to a honeymoon worthy destination.

, Consider booking with responsibletravel.com, gogreentravelgreen.com or realexperiencethailand.com. Read the company's mission statement and commit a little extra money to a company that researches and books only environmentally conscious services.

, These sites provide an aggregate of hotels, lodges and resorts that provide green services.

, Book these cars ahead of time, because they can be harder to find. If your honeymoon is within driving distance, then book a rental car that is more fuel efficient than the 1 you own.

, Either book a room with a kitchenette and shop at local markets or choose restaurants that serve local food. Eating local fare supports local farmers and it uses less carbon to transport.

, Many marketplace souvenirs are made in faraway countries and shipped to tourist destinations. Travel a short distance to pick up art personally.

In remote parts of Montana and Wyoming, there are resorts that cater specifically to winter crowds with snowmobiling, ice fishing, and hot tubs made for romantic unwinding. The West Coast also provides an array of sightseeing and exploring, at an off-season reduced cost.


If you prefer a romantic and secluded winter getaway, look to the East Coast, where traditional beach tourism will be minimal, but cozy accommodations will be many. Check into the North Carolina Outer Banks, where shelling and wildlife will be excellent, and crowds nonexistent. Visiting an Eastern beach is an excellent choice for having a local honeymoon, as many touristy venues will be closed. You will get to experience life in the off season, with days strolling the beach and nights with home cooked meals by the fire.
Let's not forget the appeal of a wintery European adventure. Ski the Alps in Switzerland or gaze upon Buckingham Palace in the lightly falling snow. The climate varies widely in Europe – coastal areas will be warmer, while inland, more mountainous areas will provide the winter you're looking for (just make sure everything is still open!).;
, Elsewhere around the world, your options are many. In equatorial locations like the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, or elsewhere in the Caribbean, the season extends throughout most of the year, and is not impacted by our traditional concept of a 4-season year. In the Southern Hemisphere, summer will be in full swing, and you will have many of the same options as a summer honeymoon in the Northern Hemisphere to choose from.


And for some of these places, even though the weather is the same, it's still the off-season for tourists. You could have the great weather and not have to deal with the crowds. A true win-win.
Make sure it's not the rainy season instead. You don't want to trade the snowbanks of home for riverbanks encroaching upon your hotel.

, Mid-continental locations like Calgary, Alberta, or small Midwestern towns like Hermann, Missouri can give you a wide range of wonderful options as well. Calgary, for instance, combines excellent big city thrills with nearby wonderlands such as Banff and Lake Louise. Hermann, known for being a quaint German town that still clings to Alpine culture, will give you a European trip without leaving the US.


Picture your winter honeymoon, nestled away in a warm log cabin, where only the birds can bear witness of your love. You'll be cuddled up in each others' arms, amid a crackling fire, sipping on hot cider, where love can grow and bloom to its fullest potential. Where passion can ignite without boundaries or borders. Where intensity knows no bounds. Life's depth, begins in this moment.

, Planning a winter honeymoon doesn't have to be boring! In fact, winter is one of the best times to plan a honeymoon in the Northern Hemisphere because it is the off season for tourism, which means that you will pay less money for many of the same attractions, and will face less difficulty in booking. There will be fewer crowds, cheaper prices, and still plenty of things to do.


Regardless of what appeals most to you, ultimately the most important part of any good honeymoon is your companion on the journey. Whatever you plan, it will take a backseat to the memories you'll be making with your new spouse.

, Before you get attached to anywhere, check out the weather first for your ideal dates. If it's monsoon season or the middle of a blizzard, you may want to go with your plan B. Either that or change the dates you were considering – a honeymoon doesn't have to be at any specific time.


If you plan to travel a distance, plan for the possibility of inclement weather. Allow yourself some leeway should anything happen. If you find yourself with a very tight itinerary, you increase your risk of losing money if your flight is delayed.

Determine your budget.,
Do research and then book your lodging.,
Shop around for cheap transportation.,
Plan activities.",How to Plan a Winter Honeymoon2," Look for ways to save money on the wedding and aim for a honeymoon that you can afford. This will not be your only vacation with your new spouse and you should never go into debt to pay for it – if you do, it'll just wind up being stressful. There are many options for cheaper honeymoons that will have just as many positive memories as expensive honeymoons without damaging your finances.


Always plan on spending more money than you think you will need. Little costs add up, especially if you are in a tourist destination. If you think you will spend a thousand dollars, be open to the fact that it could be closer to twice that, depending on your location and how frugal your plans are.

, Do you want to stay in a hotel? A log cabin? A bed and breakfast? A cabin or a small bed and breakfast can be a quiet retreat with few other guests that give your trip a more intimate feel. However, a fancy hotel can make you feel like a red-carpet star. What are you and your partner's preferences?


Once you know what you and your partner would like, make sure to research your options well. Do the places you're considering have good reviews? Do they fit your budget? Are they available for the dates needed? Are there restaurants and things to do nearby? Location is very important, too.
Honeymoon suites are often the most expensive, but don't often offer amenities very different from standard or deluxe rooms (unless you can manage a free upgrade, then they're definitely worth it). While it's understandable to want to broadcast your new marriage, go in with the understanding that you will be spending a lot of time outside of the room and do not need to bust your budget on lodging. Ask about the honeymoon suite, but if it's outlandish, know that your trip will still be amazing – after all, it's about you two, not where you stay.

, Do you want to fly to your destination? Take the train? Drive? A train ride to your destination might give you a change of mood that is also cheaper and often more reliable than flying. However, distance generally determines everything. What's feasible for your situation?


If you do need to fly, do plenty of comparison shopping and book your flights about 2 months in advance, early in the week, and not during prime business hours. Research shows this time will generally secure you the cheapest flight., Once all of the excitement from the wedding quiets down, your first couple of nights will likely be spent sleeping (or doing other things in the bedroom). But beyond that, you'll want an itinerary prepared with a few memories. Don't overpack it, but do find a nice restaurant, a museum to check out, an artsy side of town, or something up your alley to make the most of your time there.


See what free events will be happening while you are there and plan around them. Many times these community events, especially if you're somewhere foreign, will be the most memorable. Also, you'll experience things off the beaten path and it's free, so there's nothing to lose.

If you are traveling out of the country, make legal preparations.,
Get vaccinated, if necessary.,
Pack for the weather.,
Leave room for a few souvenirs.,
Buy your honey a honeymoon-themed gift for the trip.",How to Plan a Winter Honeymoon3," It can take as long as 6 months to get your passport. If you don't already have one, apply now. You can buy a passport photo at most photo stores and apply for a passport at your local post office or courthouse.


For certain countries, you'll need a tourist visa, too. Do your research online about whether citizens of your country need visas to go to your destination. It depends on where you're coming from, too.

, Getting sick overseas can be costly and very stressful. Lower your risk of spending your time sick in bed by getting your travel vaccinations. There are essentially zero health risks to being vaccinated and it's a very cheap way to protect yourself.


You should get vaccinated at least 2-3 months before you leave for your trip. Last minute vaccines will not be very effective for preparing you for your stay. If you're not sure whether you need vaccinations are not, the CDC's website has recommendations based on the type of traveler you are and where you plan to travel., If you're going somewhere chilly and your body isn't used to colder climes, be sure to bring plenty of layers. You'll want socks, gloves, a thick coat, a sweater, the whole nine yards. You researched the weather, right? What's it like?


You may want to bring a few ""just in case"" pieces. If there's a legitimate chance it could rain, bring an umbrella or a raincoat. A couple pairs of shoes, tennis shoes included, is good, too. You never know – you may wind up going on a spontaneous romantic hike.

, In general, it's good to not load up on cheap souvenirs. As cute as many of the ""Just Married"" trinkets can be wherever you go, keep in mind that you will put out very few or none of these things in the future. That money is better put to having a nice dinner or doing an activity you won't have the opportunity to try for some time. That being said, you'll probably want a couple of things to remember your trip by, so leave a bit of room in your pack just in case.


Postcards are a good, small trinket to take back (useful, too). You may also want some food items or other, more practical things to take back with you. And don't forget gifts for mom and dad!

, In order to build the excitement for the trip even more, have a gift with you to make the vacation extra special. It could be something warm for them to wear on the mountainside or something teeny-tiny for them to wear in the bedroom. Whatever it is, you'll remember it from your honeymoon and it will have that special place in your heart for years to come.


Surprising them on the train or plane is great, but you may also want to hold off until you get to the hotel. Another good idea is to plan a ""secret activity"" they don't know about. Then when they say, ""I didn't bring my suit!"" or ""I have nothing to wear,"" surprise. You came prepared. Let the memories commence!

Pay any honeymoon registry fees, as necessary.

,
Add items from your honeymoon wish list to your registry.,
Include the URL for your honeymoon registry in your bridal shower, bachelor/bachelorette party, wedding reception and wedding invitations.

",How to Create a Honeymoon Registry," Before you can ask your wedding guests for contributions, you must first be able to explain what they are contributing to. Research locations, flights, accommodations and tourist attractions in order to create a detailed description of your honeymoon vacation, from start to finish.;
, Whichever site you choose, you will be guided through the process of registering, then setting up your registry account, and then will be given a unique URL for your registry's webpage.

,, You will do this from the web page your site of choice assigns to you.

Talk with your partner about the mishap.,
Call friends or family members to vent.,
Make an agreement with your partner to move forward and stay positive.",How to Cope with Honeymoon Mishaps1," Maybe the most effective way to cope with a mishap during your honeymoon is to sit down with your partner and discuss it together. Share your feelings about the mishap with your partner and listen to what they have to say about the issue. Sometimes, simply talking about the mishap can help you both move on and laugh about the mishap together.Though the mishap may be stressful for both of you, you can both also try to see it as a way to bond with each other in a time of stress. No union is ever perfect after all, and having a bumpy honeymoon will only help you both create lasting memories together.
For example, maybe your five star resort on a tropical island suddenly gets hit by bad weather. You may say to your partner, “I can’t believe this is happening, and on our honeymoon!” Your partner may also agree with you and as you discuss the issue, you may both be able to laugh at the situation together.;
, You can also turn to family and friends back home for support. Take some time to yourself to call a close friend or a family member and vent. Let out all your anxiety about the mishap when you talk a friend or family member so you can then be more collected and calm around your partner.When you call a friend or family member, you may also ask them for advice on how to best handle the situation. It may be helpful to ask a family member, such as your mother or father, if they experienced issues during their honeymoon. You may then be able to relate to their experience and feel better about your situation.

, Once you address the issue with your partner, you should both agree to move forward with your honeymoon and try to have a good time despite the mishap. Remind each other to stay positive and try to embrace any challenges as a couple and as a team. Work together to make your honeymoon great, even with mishaps.


For example, you may tell your partner, “Let’s agree to try to still enjoy ourselves and stay positive. We can’t let one set up or mishap ruin our honeymoon.”

Ask others for suggestions or advice on what to do instead.,
Make your time together meaningful and special.",How to Cope with Honeymoon Mishaps2," You and your partner can cope with a honeymoon mishap by planning a fun alternative to your old plans.

Come up with fun alternative plans with your partner so you can still enjoy yourselves.You and your partner may sit down and make a list of alternative activities you can do together for fun on your honeymoon. Get creative and brainstorm fun ideas so you can still spend quality time together.

, If you are staying at a hotel or a resort, you may ask a representative at the front desk for advice on what you can do as a guest if you are limited to staying in the hotel. Or if you are staying at a B&B, you may call down to reception and ask them if there are any indoor activities you and your partner can do. Reach out to others and see if there are other activities you can still do on your honeymoon despite a mishap.For example, you may discover there is an indoor bar with a lounge singer in the hotel that you can go to with your partner rather than venture outside in bad weather. Or maybe there is a games room in the resort that you and your partner can spend time in while you wait for a storm to blow over.

, Whatever you and your partner decide to do as you try to stay positive, you should both strive to have a time together that is meaningful and special. Be present and aware of your partner’s needs, especially if the mishap is stressing them out. Suggest fun things you can do as a couple instead and try to find activities that are specific to you as a couple.


For example, if you and your partner love Mexican food but are unable to go out to a Mexican restaurant in the area where you had reservations due to a mishap, you may get the restaurant to deliver your meal or have the hotel chef make the meal in the hotel for you both.

Limit your alcohol intake.,
Do some exercise.,
Schedule in some alone time.",How to Cope with Honeymoon Mishaps3," One way to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety on your honeymoon is to try to limit how much alcohol you drink on the trip.

You may end up feeling more anxious and on edge if you drink a lot of alcohol throughout the day on your honeymoon.You may also consider having less caffeine when you are on your honeymoon, such as coffee, soda, or caffeinated tea. Caffeine can end up making you feel anxious and stressed, especially in high amounts.

, Exercising can help you release any anxiety and allow you to feel energized. You may try squeezing in a morning run when you are on your honeymoon or take an exercise class at your hotel or resort. You and your partner may try working out together on your honeymoon as part of your plans so you can both feel energized on your trip.You may also pack light workout gear like a tension band in your luggage for the trip. This way, you can use the tension band in your hotel room as part of a morning exercise routine, leaving you feeling relaxed and calm for the rest of the day.

, Though you and your partner should want to spend lots of quality time together, you should both also try to have alone time on your honeymoon. This may be as simple as taking time to read alone by the pool while your partner goes for a swim. Or you may end up taking a nap in the hotel room while your partner goes for a run. Try to give each other some space so you can also have alone time as part of the trip.You may talk to your partner about the importance of having alone time before you embark on your honeymoon so you are both on the same page. Having time on your own is an important element of a healthy relationship and you and your partner should try to integrate it in your honeymoon.

Secure in-demand necessities immediately.,
Secure the reception site for the day before the wedding, too.,
Hunt for savings on readily available items.,
Make a plan for afterwards, too.",How to Cater Your Own Wedding," There's no such thing as too early, so begin researching and planning your menu right away (ideally no later than when you settle on a date). Whichever direction you decide to go, expect the unexpected. Give yourself plenty of time to address any unforeseen problems or overlooked details that might pop up along the way. Remember that, in addition to cooking up some food for everyone, you will also have to deal with issues like:Supplies
Servers
Storage
Transportation
Kitchen space and equipment;
, Remember that catering is just one facet of your wedding, which means plenty of other details will demand your attention between now and then. Don’t trust things to memory. Make organization a priority. As you start your research and planning, keep records for easy reference later on. Create separate binders, computer files, and/or journals for things like:Recipes
Contacts
Calendars
Contracts
Coupons

, Talk to any friends, family, or other associates who have experience catering large events on their own. Whether it was for a wedding or some other large gathering, ask for their advice on what worked and what they learned from any mistakes. If possible, specifically seek out those whose wedding (or other gathering) mirrors your own plans for your reception, since their advice may apply more directly.For instance, an outdoor reception may face unique issues that do not occur with indoor receptions, and vice versa.

, If you’ve already booked a space to hold your reception, take a look at the kitchen and serving facilities. Determine what resources are available. Plan your menu around what can be done in that space, rather than try something too ambitious that the space isn’t equipped for. If you haven’t decided on a space, use the same considerations as a deciding factor. Pay attention to things like:The number and size of ovens, freezers, and refrigerators.
Which cookware is provided and which you will need to provide yourself.
The number and location of power sources for electrical equipment.

, Most importantly, decide how much you are willing to spend on your wedding in general. Expect the reception and catering to take up roughly half of this figure. Devote half of your budget to these costs for now.Catering the wedding yourself can lower your expenses significantly. However, it’s still better to assume that it will cost just as much as hiring professionals. This way you’re more likely to have money in reserve to cover or lower any unexpected costs., Keep in mind that you can be held liable for any unforeseen disasters that might occur due to what you serve and how. Don’t expect to be exempt from this just because you aren’t a professional caterer. If you don’t have already have a policy that will cover this event, factor in the cost of a single-event policy that includes:Accidents
Injuries
Food poisoning

, Find out how many people you plan on serving. However, don’t send out invitations just yet. Keep this list to yourself for now so you can adjust it as needs be without hurting anyone’s feelings. Create categories for people you definitely want to be there and others you would like to have, but who could be scratched to keep your budget in check.Aim for a total guest list that’s less than 125 people. Expect preparing and serving food for any more than that to be unfeasible without the use of commercial equipment, storage space, and staff.

, When you first start pondering what to serve, don’t worry about coming up with a master plan right off the bat. Brainstorm as many different options as possible. You may have a pretty firm idea of what you want at first, but you may find that you need to revise or scrap plans entirely as you go along, so have plenty of back-up ideas in reserve. Variables that might affect your final decision include your:Budget
Culinary skills
Storage space available
Available cookware and/or kitchen facilities at home
Reception site’s kitchen facilities.

, If the timing of your ceremony and reception is already set in stone, refer to your schedule to decide what sort of menu to plan. If not, plan your wedding day around your food to make things easier on yourself. Expect your guests to expect a full meal if your reception occurs during meal times. Otherwise, simply prepare the appropriate food items for the service specified on your invitations, like “Dessert reception to follow.” Traditional hours and popular menu ideas include:Breakfast (9 a.m. to 11 a.m): waffles, pancakes, eggs. crepes, cinnamon buns, muffins, danishes.Brunch (11 a.m. to 2 p.m): frittatas, grilled vegetables, smoked meats, open-face sandwiches, omelets, French toast.Lunch (12 p.m. to 3:30 p.m): salads, frittatas, tacos, focaccia, paella, mole chicken, shredded meat with rice and vegetables.Afternoon tea with snacks (2 p.m. to 4 p.m): tea sandwiches, chicken salad, egg salad, scones, meat on toast.
Dinner or full cocktail buffet (5 p.m. to 8 p.m.): salad, canapes, dumplings, fajitas, antipasti, pasta, salmon, chicken, lamb, steak, turkey.Hors d’oeuvres (8 p.m. to ?): toast bar, fish and chips, fruit, oysters, salad, shrimp, kebabs.Dessert (9 p.m. to ?): cake, cupcakes, ice cream, macaroons, cookies, pie, brownies., Maybe the sheer number of dishes that you could possibly pick from makes you feel too daunted to start choosing. Or, maybe too many ideas are coming too fast. Either way, if you feel overwhelmed, come up with a theme for you menu. Narrow your choices down instantly by scratching off any that don't fit that theme. For instance, you could:Highlight the location of your wedding, like having BBQ if it's in Texas or lobster in Maine.
Streamline by sticking to just one style of cuisine, like French, Italian, or Japanese.
Celebrate your relationship with meaningful foods, like the first meal you shared together.

, As you brainstorm menu items, keep your wedding date in mind. Earmark dishes that feature meats and produce that are in season at that time of year. Impress your guests with freshness. At the same time, make life easier on yourself by going with ingredients that are sure to be readily available.To find out which meats and produce are in season during your wedding, search online for charts like this one: http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/seasonal-calendar/all


, Go over your guest list. Identify anyone who may have special dietary needs or concerns. Figure out how many may require an alternative menu to the one you end up serving everyone else. Needs and concerns may include:Vegan or vegetarian options
Lactose intolerance
Food allergies
Religious restrictions

, If you’re catering your own wedding, keep in mind that your attention is going be pretty divided on the big day. Don’t plan on plating each individual guest’s meal yourself. Instead, go with a less labor-intensive method, like:Buffet style
Cafeteria style
Family style

, Whether you’re planning snacks for an afternoon tea service or a full meal for dinner, remember that you’re cooking in bulk. Avoid complex recipes. Save your master-chef skills for smaller affairs and focus instead on foods that can be easily made, stored, and served. Scratch off any recipes that require lots of:Prep
Steps
Cookware
Constant supervision

, As you narrow your different ideas down to just a handful, start focusing on the nuts and bolts for each one. Figure out what labor, supplies, and other logistics are required to execute each plan. This includes (but isn’t limited to):Cooking supplies, like ingredients, cookware, and at-home kitchen facilities.
Storage supplies, such as refrigerators, freezers, food containers, and transportation.
Serving/warming/cooling supplies, like utensils, dishware, sternos, extension cords, ice, and on-site kitchen facilities.
Manpower needed to cook, set up, serve, and clean up.

, Remember: you’re going to have plenty else to do in the days leading immediately up to your wedding. Plan your menu accordingly so you can prepare the bulk of it (if not all of it) well beforehand. As long as you can safely store it in the meantime, go with dishes that you can prepare weeks in advance (like soups, pasta dishes, or casseroles), which help you avoid or resolve such mishaps as:Conflicting demands on your time
Longer-than-expected cooking or prep times
Running out of supplies
Ruined batches

, Avoid the temptation to cook everything. Focus your cooking efforts on doing a couple of dishes really well instead of trying to take on too much at once. Balance out your menu (or even load it) with foods that can be served as is, at room temperature, without any real need of a kitchen, like sandwich meats, salads, and cold soups.This is an especially good idea if the reception site's kitchen facilities are limited, and/or you have few hands to help you out on the day of.

, Now that you have a firmer grasp on what each of your menu plans will entail, go over them again to decide which is most feasible. Additionally, reconsider any other decisions about other wedding plans that you’re willing to change (like the site of your reception or the time of day) if doing so will make life easier. Always opt for simplicity to help ensure easy execution and fewer headaches down the road. For instance:Change the reception from mealtime to another service to accommodate more guests with less food (like canapes or finger sandwiches).
Narrow your guest list down to a select few if you will be serving full meals (such as meat dishes that definitely need to be cooked).
Opt for alternative (or even main) items that satisfy multiple needs and concerns (like a meat- and dairy-free pasta entree for vegan, vegetarian, kosher, and lactose intolerant diets.

, Once you have settled on a master plan, add up all the expenses needed to execute it. Compare this with the budget that you’ve set aside for reception and catering. Decide whether you’re saving enough to warrant moving forward on your own, or if it may be less of a headache to hire a professional company instead.


Again, self-catering your wedding can help save as much as a quarter of your total wedding budget. However, if you have little to no experience in serving food on this scale, keep in mind that you may have overlooked some expenses. If self-catering is already taking up half of your total budget, it may be advisable to go with a pro., Don’t take the “self” in “self-catering” too literally. Ask volunteers to assist in the making, storing, and transporting of your foods, as well as the set-up, serving, and clean-up at the reception itself. Don’t overburden yourself by taking things on singlehandedly. Seek help from:Your partner
Friends
Family

, Arrange a meal with your team. Make your catering plans the agenda to be discussed. At the same time, make this meal sort of a trial run to identify strengths and weaknesses in your team. Assign each person the same sort of tasks that you’re thinking about assigning them for your wedding. This way you can:Reassign tasks if someone else turns out to be better suited for particular jobs.
Seek out new members for your team if it seems like you'll need more (or better) hands on deck.
Create teams within teams if two or more members work better when paired together.

, When you sit down with your team, create a detailed list of what needs to be done. Just as importantly, specify when each task needs to be completed by. Then determine who is responsible for doing it. Make sure everyone is clear on the details, especially if the success of one task depends upon the completion of another. This may require some reorganizing. For instance:Let’s say you are the only person with a house and a big kitchen, while everyone on your team lives in apartments with limited kitchen space. Because of this, anyone assigned with actual cooking will use your kitchen while you take care of other things.
However, as big as your kitchen is, it isn’t a commercial kitchen. So you still need to schedule assignments in an orderly manner. Therefore, food will have to be made according to how long it can be safely stored.
Now let’s say the food that will last the longest is your Aunt Janine’s amazing pasta dish, which can be frozen. But unfortunately Aunt Janine won’t be available in the time allotted for making it.
This means you may have to ask her to give the recipe to someone else and take care of another item when she’s finally available later on.

, Don’t feel like self-catering is an all-or-nothing proposition. Depending on your plans and what you can reasonably expect from your team, decide whether you should divvy tasks up between yourselves and outside professional help. For instance, you can still take care of the bulk of tasks while hiring others to do things like:Preparing your wedding cake
Tending bar
Serving food
Cleaning up

, Go over what needs to be bought and/or rented. Determine which items are readily available at all times and which should be acquired immediately. The latter will vary according to your plans, needs, and available resources, but could include things like:The reception site
Rented storage space
Cooking equipment
Serving ware and utensils
Tables, chairs, and linens

, Remember: you might be doing the catering yourself, but that doesn’t mean catering is the only thing you’ll be doing on your wedding day. Make sure you have access to your reception site the day before so you can set everything up with minimal fuss. Reduce the amount of work that needs to be done on the big day itself so you’re not overwhelmed.If you’ve already booked your reception site and the day before your wedding is no longer available, expand your team so more people are available to help with the set up.

, If your budget is limitless, this might be less of a concern than the peace of mind of having everything you need right from the get-go. If not, though, refer to your plan’s calendar. Identify when you will need to secure the more easy-to-get items for each task. Spend the time in between hunting for deals by:


Comparing prices between stores.
Finding items available in bulk for less money.Taking advantage of coupons, sales, and discounts.
Determining whether it will be cheaper to rent or buy equipment.

, Remember: prepping and serving your food are only part of what needs to be done. Keep in mind that there will be plenty of work left to do once the reception ends. Since you yourself may be off and away to your honeymoon by this time, make sure you select trustworthy people to take care of these in your absence. Tasks to be done could include:Clean-up and removal of all personal equipment and belongings.
Disposal, storage, or donation of leftover food.
Return of all rental equipment.

Give the role to a friend who volunteers.,
Think about the pre-teens and teenagers in your family.,
Make your dog your ""flower girl."",
Use a boy ""announcer.""",How to Choose an Alternative to a Flower Girl1," Instead of having young flower girls, consider using older women in your family, such as your grandma or great aunt. They'll love to be included in a special way, and the sight of your grandma throwing flower petals into the air is to sure to bring a smile to everyone's face., One of your adult friends may find the idea of being a flower girl enchanting. It may not be a good idea to assign a friend the role, as it's normally reserved for a young girl. However, if someone you know expresses interest in being the flower girl, consider letting that person do it.The exception to not asking a friend to do it is if you're having an adults-only wedding. In that case, it may be appropriate to ask a friend to be your flower girl (or woman, as the case may be). Alternatively, you could name the person a bridesmaid, but still have them throw flowers.

, While pre-teens and teenagers are usually made junior bridesmaids, they can also be flower girls if that's your preference. However, it's important to talk to them and make sure they won't feel slighted by the role. Emphasize how important the role is to you to help them feel valued.

, If you want to include your dog in the ceremony, you could dress it up in a garland of flowers. Then another flower girl could lead it down the aisle, or you could have someone stand at the altar and call the dog to them., If you don't have a girl to be in your wedding, try using a younger boy as an ""announcer."" He can carry a sign or wear a small chalkboard that announces the bride is coming down the aisle. Alternatively, you could have the boy throw petals."

Decide on prayers and music.,
Go to confession before your wedding.",How to Be Married in a Catholic Church," The Catholic church prefers a wedding be celebrated at one of the engaged person's own church. Your local priest or deacon will have to give the initial green light for your readiness for marriage; so you will want to make a good impression.If you don’t live near the church you were baptized or confirmed in, start attending regular mass and sign up to be a member at a Catholic church you’d like to be married in.
Get approval from the pastor of the church you want to get married in, if it's different from your local church.
If you plan on being married in a region different from your local church, find which diocese that region is a part of.
The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has a zip code search tool to find your diocese.;
, Getting married in a Catholic church takes time and it requires the right assessments and paperwork. After you decide to be married, contact the right people at your home church ASAP. At some parishes this is the priest, and at others this can be a designated layperson. During this initial appointment, you will go over the rules and procedures for your diocese.


Each party must be able to give full consent to marriage.
Each engaged person should not show signs of coercion.Mental illness can prevent full consent.
The sacrament of marriage will be explained and should be understood.

, You will have to show your priest a copy of your baptismal certificate that is less than six months old. Call the church you were baptized in to find out how to do this. You will need to give them your full name, date of birth and the names of your parents. Only one spouse has to be Catholic to be married in a Catholic church. However, your fiance should be a baptized Christian. If one of you is not baptized, you can still be married in a Catholic church, but it won't be sacramental.If you are widowed, you will need to show evidence of death paperwork.
If you received an annulment of a previous marriage, you will need to show your priest this paperwork.
You can apply for a Declaration of Nullity, if you do not have an annulment from a previous marriage. This will be decided by a tribunal at your home parish.

, This is an assessment given by your priest that helps determine the strengths and weaknesses of your relationship. FOCCUS is a popular test, but each parish picks which inventory they use.It will give the priest an indication of the right counseling program for you and your spouse, because it will test in areas like communication, finances, interfaith marriages and sexuality., If you are a confirmed Catholic, but marrying a baptized person from another Christian religion, you will have to file a dispensation form. Other dispensation forms are for when a Catholic is marrying a non-baptized person.You will have to get a “Permission to Enter into a Mixed Marriage Form” from your priest, if you’re marrying a baptized non-Catholic.
If you’re marrying someone not baptized, like an Atheist, Muslim or Jewish person, you will need your priest to approve a “Dispensation From Disparity of Cult Form.”
A wedding between a Catholic and someone not baptized can still be held in a Catholic church, but it won't be considered a sacrament until both parties are baptized.

, You and your spouse will be tested in front of your priest. He will base the individual assessment on written or verbal responses from both of you. Since marriage in the Catholic church is a sacrament, the priest must determine you have presence of faith in order to marry you.

, Remember that many churches do not hold weddings on Sundays, since it conflicts with regular mass. Many do not hold wedding ceremonies during Lent either, since it is a time for penance and not celebration. Consult your priest before you set a definite date in order to prevent conflicts.

, The Catholic Church requires couples go through preparation classes to confirm their commitment to each other and the church. Programs vary from parish to parish and different dioceses, but many include group interaction with other engaged couples. Some courses are weekend getaways, while some are held on scheduled evenings.Specific programs are offered for things like remarriage, bringing children into a marriage and interfaith marriages.
Some of the issues covered are prayer, the meaning of marriage and sacramental roles.
Most classes are taught by an experienced married couple.
You will receive a certificate of completion to present to the marrying priest upon finishing the course.

, The Catholic church stresses that financial issues should never be a hindrance, when a couple is ready for marriage. Wedding offerings are determined by each parish and can cover things like an organist or vocalist. Marriage preparation classes often include only material costs.

If you and your future spouse are experiencing financial hardship, you can come to an agreement with your local priest.
Ornate clothes and fresh flowers are considered extras by the Catholic Church and are not things they help with.

, They like couples to learn the method several months before marriage. The class will go over biology and how to use ovulation cycles to plan for children., The Catholic church has different handbooks you can choose prayers and music from. ""Together for Life"" and the ""Rite of Marriage"" have bible verses and music appropriate for a Catholic wedding.You can make a couple of different choices on how you respond to the priest during the ceremony.
You can choose from several different prayers the priest will use throughout the ceremony.
Music must be similar to what you hear during regular mass., Some parishes require the sacrament of reconciliation before marriage, if both parties are Catholic. Others may not require confession, but they still strongly recommend it."

Give them a wagon to pull.,
Use a garland instead of petals.,
Have the flower girl carry a bouquet or basket.",How to Choose an Alternative to a Flower Girl2," The wagon could have flowers in it, making it similar to the petal idea. However, the kids could also pull a wagon carrying a favorite pet with the outside covered in ribbons and bows. It could also be a way to honor a deceased loved one, by having a portrait in the wagon.Alternatively, the ring bearer and flower girl could ride in the wagon, particularly if they are small., If you still want to keep flowers a part of the walk down the aisle, consider using a garland instead of petals. Basically, you'd need two flower kids to hold each end of the flower garland. This option is also good for younger kids who might not be able to understand what they need to do with the petals., If the venue doesn't allow flower petals to be thrown, you can simply have the flower girl carry a bouquet. You could also make a small basket of single stems and have the flower girl hand out flowers to random wedding guests."
"
Use pinwheels instead of flowers.,
Consider balloons.,
Have kids carry a banner.,
Use a kid to carry your train.,
Try ribbon wands.,
Skip having them carry anything at all.",How to Choose an Alternative to a Flower Girl3," Flower petals can get expensive. Plus, if the flower girl is young, she may have a hard time grasping the concept of throwing petals. Instead, have the flower girl or girls carry a pinwheel down the aisle that matches your wedding colors. It's fun, colorful, and festive., Another option, particularly for an outdoor wedding, is balloons. You go for standard helium balloons that the flower girl releases when they make it to the altar, or you can go for slightly fancier versions, such as helium balloons covered in light fabric that can be set behind the altar with a weight at the bottom., One way to include kids in your wedding without having a flower girl is to have them carry a small banner. The banner can announce that the bride is coming, or it can say something like ""Time to Celebrate!"" Either way, the banner would come down the aisle at the same time the flower girls normally would., If you or your bride has a long dress with a train, having a little helper can be sweet. Basically, the kid would walk behind the bride, lifting the train off the ground a bit. As an added bonus, it makes it a little easier for the bride or brides to walk., Ribbon wands are simply a pretty stick with a ribbon or ribbons attached to one end. The bonus to these items it that kids love them. They can wave them around, twirling the ribbons, as they walk down the aisle ahead of the bride., It can be sweet just to have girls in simple dresses wearing flower crowns as flower girls. They don't need to carry anything at all. In fact, this option is good for younger girls who don't yet have the coordination to carry a bouquet or toss petals."

Give the MC a written list of names.,
Choose a good song.,
Plan the timeline.,
Communicate the plan to the wedding party.,
Line everyone up.",How to Announce the Bridal Party at a Reception1," Your wedding party is a big part of your special day. When you introduce them, you want to make sure that they get the recognition that they deserve. Make sure the DJ or MC has a written list of the names of the entire bridal party. If necessary, include a pronunciation guide for the announcer. You don’t want them stumbling over an uncommon name.
Make sure the names are written in the order in which the members of the party will enter.;
, Music is a traditional component of the bridal party entrance. You can use it simply as soft background noise, or as a prominent feature of the announcement. If you are planning a traditional entrance, you might want to pick a popular song for the moment. Some typical choices include:”Walking on Sunshine” by Katrina and the Waves
”The Way You Make Me Feel” by Michael Jackson
”Bittersweet Symphony” by The Verve
”Viva La Vida” by Coldplay
""Waiting for Tonight” by Jennifer Lopez

, Decide what you are going to do between the ceremony and the reception. Many people choose to take formal pictures during this time. Others plan a cocktail hour so that they can mingle with guests. Whatever you do, make sure that you figure out how much time you want to have between the ceremony and the bridal party entrance.Communicate this timeline to the MC. You could say, “The ceremony will end at 5:30, and the cocktail hour will begin. At 6:30, we want the guests to be escorted into the dining room. At 6:40, we would like the bridal party to be announced.”

, Make sure that each member of the bridal party understands where they need to be and when. You don’t want to be missing any members of the party when it’s time for the big announcement. Plan the timeline in advance, and give them clear instructions.You could send an e-mail the week before to everyone in your wedding party. It should give a detailed timeline of the entire wedding day.
You can also remind everyone on the big day. During pictures you could say, “Remember, everyone, we’ll line up to enter the reception right at 6:35.”

, Gather your wedding party near the door where they will enter the reception. Traditionally, they will line up in the order that they entered the ceremony. That means the bridesmaid and groomsmen pairs will enter first, followed by the maid of honor and best man. The newly married couple will be the last to be announced.

If you have a wedding coordinator, you can have them organize the line-up.

Ask in person whenever possible.,
Write them a letter.,
Send a reminder card.",How to Ask Someone to Be Your Groomsman1," Receiving an invitation to be a groomsman is exciting. It also sends a meaningful message that you value your relationship with someone enough to ask that they stand beside you while you make one of the most significant commitments in your life. Accordingly, make your request personal by asking in person if you can.

There doesn’t need to be any pomp and circumstance. Simply get together and say something like, “Hey man, our friendship has meant a lot to me over the years. I wanted to ask you if you’d we willing to join Carrie and I on our wedding day as a groomsman?”
Keep in mind you can still send along a funny card or a thoughtful gift in the mail.;
, If you’re not able to speak in person with all of your groomsmen, consider writing a letter to those you will ask by mail. Since a letter can be more personal than a phone call, this is preferable, especially for a close friend that lives further away.Be specific with something like, “I’m writing to invite you to join us on our wedding day as a groomsman.”
Include a more personal message as well. For instance, say something about what your relationship with the recipient has meant, and why you want them to be at your wedding.

, Even if you’re able to have the conversation in person, it’s worth sending a card with the details. Since you already spoke about it in person, the card will simply function as a tangible reminder, with important information like dates, location, and dress code.Choose or make a card that reflects your personality, an interest you share with your groomsman, or a design that fits with your wedding theme.
Look at greeting card websites and wedding websites for examples of card designs. Many will allow you to order cards in a design you like and customize lettering and color schemes.
If you haven’t finalized a date but want to nail down your wedding party, let them know what time of year you’re thinking. Get back to them about a specific day as soon as you determine one.

Mix, mingle and move around.,
Reach out to relatives.,
Table talk.,
Give thanks.,
Imbibe and feast in moderation.,
Have fun.",How to Be a Good Wedding Guest," The best way to meet people and interact at weddings is to explore the different areas of the party to see where other like-minded people might be gathering. If you are rolling solo, see if there are any other singles mixing around the bar or mingling by the buffet, and strike up a conversation. Giving someone a compliment is always a great way to initiate a dialogue. Try, “I love your dress, that color looks great on you! I’m Stacey and I used to work with the bride. What’s your name?” And try to seal it with a handshake (if your hands aren’t full with food or drinks) to make it more personal. If you know several people at the wedding and spot some singles, make the grand gesture of going up to them and introducing yourself and possibly some others you know there.;
, Often, one of the most uncomfortable things about attending a family member’s wedding is seeing all the relatives you haven’t seen in years. Although it may be somewhat awkward, it’s important to make a point of interacting with your relatives. Sure, your great Aunt Helen won’t be able to stop talking about “how much you’ve grown,” but connecting with family members, especially ones from out of town is part of the wedding celebration. Be prepared to tell relatives what you’ve been up to in your personal and professional life and direct similar questions to them. Before your know it, you’ll feel like family again!

, When seated at an assigned table, you should introduce yourself to everyone else at the table. The bride and groom put you at that table for a reason, so utilize the seating arrangement to get to know some of the other guests. Engage in conversation by finding out how the others know the bride and groom, where they are from and even their occupation. You could discover a love interest, new friend, or potential business contact.

, As a guest at a wedding, you should make a point to introduce yourself to the bride and grooms’ families and express your thanks. If you can site a specific element of the wedding that stands out in your mind as memorable, include that in your conversation. Try: “Hi Mr. and Mrs. Thompson. I’m Harry and I work with your daughter. She’s a beautiful bride. Thank you for a spectacular evening. The photo booth was a fun touch. Congratulations to you both.”

, Free food and drink at a wedding is always tempting, but limit yourself to a small amount. If appetizers are available, help yourself to a small plate.  After all guests have been served you can help yourself to seconds if there is still food available.  

, The point of a wedding party is to have fun and celebrate with the newlyweds. So, eat, dance, partake in group activities and enjoy talking to familiar and unfamiliar people.

Give the speech as best as you can.",How to Make a Wedding Toast," This is your chance to honor the couple, so don't wait until the night before the wedding to think of what you're going to say. Even if you want to be spontaneous in part, it's good to have a toast written out in note form in case your mind goes blank.


Start by brainstorming different anecdotes, stories, or themes that your speech might take on. What do you think of immediately when you think of your friend or relative who is getting married?
What do you want to say about your friend? What do you want to emphasize? Start thinking of the major ideas that you'd like to include in your speech. What's important about this union of two people?
Alternatively, don't worry about themes or abstract concepts and just start writing. Put pen to paper and free-write about the person who you're toasting. Aim to write for 10 minutes without stopping. Just keep your pencil moving. See what comes up.;
, The best wedding toasts are sincere stories that come straight from the heart. While some may be funny and others may be sad, all wedding toasts should have one thing in common: paying tribute to the couple, or one member of the couple, and celebrating their union in a personal way.


You don’t have to be a stand-up comedian. A humorous quote or story can add a nice touch, just keep it tasteful. Anecdotes that involve nakedness, drunkenness, or ex-significant others could make the moment awkward if the story falls flat. Err on the side of sincerity.

, Giving a toast isn’t an opportunity to show off. It isn’t your day and the toast shouldn’t be about you, even if you're a central character in one of those stories you're telling. Whether you’re telling an anecdote or reciting a poem, the toast should connect with the couple, pay tribute to them, and come from the heart.


To do a double-check, count up all the uses of ""I"" in your speech and all the uses of the newlyweds' names. If you show up more than them, you might need to revise the speech.
Speeches that dwell on how difficult marriage is, however realistic, can make it sound like the couple is doomed to fail. It's usually best to avoid cold or intellectual speeches. Just go for sincere emotion.
Treat the bride and groom as a single unit, even if you've known only one of them for a long time. Also, remember, you're not toasting to the ""good old days,"" you're toasting to their future.

, That’s your “in.” Typical wedding toasts will revolve around the first time you heard about your friend’s new partner, or the first time you realized the couple was an important part of your life, and those are perfect ways to open up the toast and make it personal. It’ll be unique because it’s your story. You can also think of creative ways to find your in:


Start your toast with a story about a challenge the couple faced together, or how one member of the couple used the other for support in a time of need.
Start your toast with observations about the way a member of the couple has changed since they started seeing each other.
When you’re old and gray, what will you remember most about the couple? What one thing will you think of?
Start your toast by celebrating an unheralded character trait in one or both members of the couple. If the groom is an astrophysicist, but you’ve seen him do something no one else has, consider starting there. Keep it clean.

, Once you've found some themes, stories, or ideas that you want to cover in your speech, you can go one of two ways: writing out the speech word-for-word, or outlining the major points. Both are equally effective methods of writing a speech for a wedding.


If you want to be more spontaneous and conversational, jot down the major talking points to jog your memory and keep your speech moving forward in a casual manner. Include short quotes or key phrases like ""Talk about meeting the bride for the first time, mention how comfortable they were with each other."" The idea is for the note to jog your memory, but the actual wording should be off the top of your head, provided you follow the next step.
If the idea of going freestyle freaks you out, write it out word for word and take special care to bring yourself back to the audience. Script out everything, down to the gestures, pauses, and glances up. Don’t give yourself any chance to mess up. Practice to make sure your speech isn't robotic., You might get flashbacks of making presentations in school, but that's a good thing. You want this to be good. Putting notes on index cards is a good way of keeping yourself organized and concise, especially if you're not confident in your public speaking abilities.If you're writing out your speech word-for-word, keep the speech big enough so that you'll be able to read it easily. Don't cram everything onto one card. Still, it's important to keep your cards manageable, so aim to have no more than three or four cards. Number your cards to make sure they're in order.
If you're writing out your major speech points only, write them clearly and concisely. You should know your own shorthand: make sure that you don't write ""Talk about that party"" on a card and go blank in the moment.

, Include a formal indication to inform them of the ending of the toast and what to say next. For example: ""Let us now toast the happiness of Jill and Jack. To Jill and Jack!"" As you say this, wave your glass to all, then tip it towards the person you are toasting to, or clink their glass if you're close enough., You should aim to trim your speech into about two minutes of solid-gold stuff that comes straight from the heart. There will likely be lots of toasts and lots of talking at most weddings, and people will be ready to eat and dance at some point, so you don't want to be the one who rambles on and stumbles over their words. Whatever the tone, the style, or the content of your wedding speech, practice it until you've smoothed out all the edges and made it short and sweet.


Do not write a long speech. A whole wedding ceremony is sometimes as short as 15 or 20 minutes. There's no reason you should give a toast that goes for more than five.
Modify your index cards as needed. If you find yourself rushing during one part of the speech, write ""slow down"" somewhere on the card where you'll see it. If you repeatedly stumble over one part, just skip it. If something isn't working, go with something else.
If you're very nervous about the speech, try to imagine where the audience is sitting, for example, and pretend to make gestures and eye contact in that direction. If you practice, it'll be automatic in the moment.

, If you’re toasting the happy couple, chances are you're not the only one. In formal weddings, the toast is usually given after the meal, between cake-cutting and desert, or after the first dances.Always check with the toastmaster or the emcee of the event to find out the schedule and order of the toasts. One traditional order for toasts is as follows:


The father of the bride or an old friend of the family will toast the couple.
The groom will toast the bridesmaids.
The best man will toast the parents of the couple.

, Before zero-hour, you’ve got a last chance to read the room and determine whether or not your written speech is appropriate. It’s never too late for an audible. If you were expecting college friends and young people and got a room full of over-60, will your toast still be acceptable? Might you cut it short before the Las Vegas story?


If you find yourself in an emergency situation, in which you feel you must throw out your speech, make sure you have something to back it up with. It wouldn't be inappropriate to go super-short but sincere, saying something like, ""There's nothing to me more thrilling than seeing these two people commit to each other for the rest of their life. Before I get choked up, I'm going to leave it at that.""

, Common wedding mistake: calming nerves with a few too many. Don’t risk making your thoughtful toast an awkward scene by slurring your words and stumbling to the microphone. Avoid drinks before you have to give your toast and celebrate with one afterwards. It’ll taste better.

, Some toasts are signaled by everyone clinking glasses, while in others the room will be totally silent and the emcee will introduce each toaster with a microphone. Whatever the protocol, follow it.


In some cultures, it’s important to make sure that all glasses are filled before giving the toast. Look around and check that all glasses (including yours) are full before making the toast. There should be wine, champagne, or something that looks like wine or champagne in your glass, as toasting with water is offensive in some cultures.

, Some people at the wedding might not know who you are, so making this clear at the beginning will avoid any confusion. Bring your glass down as you start to speak, but continue holding it in one hand.

, Look at the person you're toasting to, but also shift eye contact towards the guests occasionally. Make a conscious effort to look up and engage with everyone. Watching someone read coldly and robotically from a note card is hard to get involved with.


If you find yourself talking quickly, which happens to some people due to nerves, make a conscious effort to slow down. Pause between your sentences and take a breath. Look up, take a sip of your drink, and slow down. Speak clearly and get through it. Then, cheers.

Choose the people who will be part of the entrance.,
Give them specific instructions.,
Double-check the details.",How to Announce the Bridal Party at a Reception2," Traditionally, the bridesmaids and groomsmen are introduced to the guests during the entrance. In addition to their names, the MC should also state their relationship to the couple and their role in the wedding. For example, “Please welcome Anne Webster, Maid of Honor and sister of the bride.”If you have a flower girl and ring bearer, it is traditional to include them in the entrance. You might want to have an adult escort them, as they could be nervous.

, If your wedding is somewhat formal, you might be going for a more sedate entrance. Make sure to communicate your wishes directly to the bridal party. You don’t want to start your reception off on a bad foot by having an entrance that you don’t like.

You might send an email describing the entrance you want. You could say, “I know lots of entrances include fun dances, but my wedding is going to be more formal. I’d appreciate it if you could just walk sedately and smile.”

, The key to your big day going smoothly is careful planning. This doesn’t mean you have to run yourself ragged checking every little thing, but it’s a good idea to make sure you have the entrance planned exactly the way you want it. A few days before the wedding, make sure to:

Give your MC the list of names and pronunciation guide.
Ensure you are comfortable with your choice of music.
Follow up with the bridal party members to make sure everyone knows the plan.
If you are using a wedding coordinator, check to make sure they know your specifications.

"

Choose your style.,
Mix up the order of the party members’ entrance.,
Plan choreography.,
Have individualized entrances.",How to Announce the Bridal Party at a Reception3," Are you looking for a more unique entrance? Consider having a theme instead of just the traditional entrance. If your wedding has a theme, you could go with that. Or, you could create a separate theme for the entrance.Maybe you are huge sports fans. Many fans of the University of Nebraska football team choose to enter to the team’s “Tunnel Walk.”
If you are really into Hollywood glamour, you could make the entrance a red carpet style announcement and encourage people to snap lots of photos.

, Don’t feel like you have to be tied to the traditional wedding party entrance. This is your wedding reception, and you should feel free to do it however you like. Maybe you would like to enter first with your new spouse. Then you can join the guests in cheering on the wedding party.You could also choose to have the bridesmaids enter as a group, and then the groomsmen, instead of in pairs.

, Some fun dance moves can help your bridal party’s entrance really stand out. Traditionally, members of the group walk in. Ask your party to learn a few easy steps to get the party going.For example, if you choose a song by Michael Jackson, ask the groomsmen to try to moonwalk.
A song by Donna Summer might inspire you to teach the crew a few disco moves.
Respect your wedding party. If your friends don’t feel comfortable learning complicated steps, don’t force the issue. You don’t want them (and the rest of your guests) to feel uncomfortable., Generally, each pair in the wedding party walks or dances in to the same song. Mix things up by changing the music for each pair or person. For example, let your Irish cousins lead the way by dancing an Irish jig.You could also consider letting each person or pair choose their own music. This is a great way to allow your friends to express their individuality.

Host an event and surprise your groomsmen.,
Go the romantic route.,
Make a prank out of it.",How to Ask Someone to Be Your Groomsman2," If possible, gather all the gentlemen you’re hoping will be your groomsmen and break the news in a celebratory manner. For instance, invite them over for a pot of your world-famous chili and a couple of hands of poker.Before they arrive, relabel a few bottles of beer with customized “Groomsman” labels and set them in each spot at the table with a koozie covering the label.
Once everyone sits down, propose a toast and have everyone remove the koozies simultaneously.
Verbalize your excitement by saying something like, ""It'd really mean a lot to have you guys as my groomsmen.""

, It's not everyday you get to buy your friends roses. If they'll appreciate the humor or are just into flowers, consider sending a bouquet with a card saying something like, ""Alexander.... be my groomsman?"" Even better, send the bouquet to their home or, if you know they'd be okay with it, to their place of work., If your potential groomsmen are all over the country and you’ll be sending out snail mail requests, consider going the April Fool’s route. For instance, write, “Notice of Mandatory Attendance” on a formal looking envelope. This may get them scratching their heads as they nervously open your request, only to be relieved by the exciting content.Another idea: Send a plain envelope that reads “Important Instructions” on the exterior. Inside, include directions on how to tie a tie, as well as your folded request.
Whatever you do, make sure the letter doesn’t look like spam. Hand-write their address. You don’t want them accidentally throwing it away!

Make custom booze-themed labels.,
Give your groomsmen something to wear on your big day.,
Include a long-lasting customized gift.,
Acknowledge financial costs if necessary.",How to Ask Someone to Be Your Groomsman3," There are various websites that will help you design and order custom beer or liquor bottle labels. You can also design, print, and cut your own. Affix these directly to individual beer bottles with sticker paper, or hang more traditional cards around the necks of your groomsmen’ favorite liquor bottles.Either present these gifts in person or send them in the mail. They can be even be used to break the news, or as a follow-up to an in-person conversation.
For instance, you might customize labels that look like name tags with text like ""Groomsman Tucker.""

, Part of accepting the gig as your groomsman is agreeing to wear whatever outfit you want them to wear at your wedding. If you so happen to have style-minded friends, they may appreciate a customized something-or-other that will fit with the suits you’ve chosen.For instance, get your buddies bow ties that reflect each of their individual styles. Get that wannabe lumberjack buddy a plaid bow tie and your alma mater’s biggest fan a bow tie with the team mascot on it.

, While booze and a cigar are the traditional groomsman gifts, consider getting something a bit longer-lasting to include with your groomsman requests. For instance, a simple but classy tie clip or a lighter monogrammed a buddy’s initials is something they’ll likely keep for the rest of their lives.Cufflinks are a classic example, and can be tailored to each groomsman.
For instance, have custom-made cuff links with your favorite picture of your buddy inset, or an inscription of an inside joke between the two of you.

, Getting down to brass tacks: it costs money to be a groomsman. Tux rental alone can be expensive, not to mention peripheral costs like a wedding gift, travel costs, and a potential bachelor party. In situations where you know cost may be a factor regarding someone’s ability to be your groomsman, don’t ignore the issue.If you have a friend that may not be able to afford being your groomsman but you’d like them to be, considering covering the cost yourself.

Learn the difference between patriotism and nationalism.,
Understand how patriotism is used.,
Learn about where you live.,
Learn about your cultural and natural history as well.,
Understand the history of other countries as well.,
Stay informed.,
Keep your government honest as far as is possible.,
Participate in local government.,
Look at issues from both sides.,
Display your pride, if you want to.,
Love your country with open eyes.",How to Be Patriotic," Nationalism refers to a blind belief that one's nation or cultural heritage is superior to others, while patriotism refers to a feeling of admiration for a particular belief or way of life. The two terms are often used interchangeably, and it's important to distinguish patriotism for what it is.


Nationalism is often marked by ""us vs. them"" rhetoric and behavior. Nationalists believe that people who don't believe in the superiority of a nation or culture are somehow lesser.
A patriotic attitude is marked by an understanding of a nation's history, accomplishments, and positive contributions to culture. Patriotism also recognizes a nation's failures and negative influence.;
, Patriotism is one of the most common beliefs manipulated in propaganda. Patriotic values and rhetoric is commonly subverted by those who try to manipulate certain beliefs or behaviors. The word ""patriot"" and ""patriotism"" is often used as a bludgeon to question someone's commitment and love for their country in a way that's actually more akin to nationalism.


A patriotic person may be moved by an appeal to their love of their country. However, alert citizens should be aware of the intentions of the messages they hear and the potential impact of the actions they seek to accomplish.
How patriotic you are is not determined by how well you conform to what messages propaganda circulates as truth. Patriots can love their country without blindly following the popular majority.

, Discover the history of your nation and how it grew to be what it is today. Find facts that surprise you, challenge you, make you laugh or make you proud. Try finding more about your country's past leaders, flag, national animal, famous landmarks, gastronomy, traditions, films, literature. Learn everything and anything unique to your nation.


Read books and articles by authors writing today. Stay as up to date as possible about what it means to be a member of the country where you live.

, The land that you stand on existed long before a government was there to name it. Greece, for example, became its own country by declaring independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821, although Greek culture is ancient. A patriotic Greek person may have a fairly complicated interpretation of what it means to be Greek, and nuanced opinions about culture and government, entirely separately.


What people were native to the lands that are now your country? What grows there? What animals call it home? Learn everything you can about the place you call home.

, Just as it's important to get a good sense of the land you call home, it's important to get a good sense of the land your neighbors call home as well. Learn your country's place in the world.


Learn about the beliefs others have about their own countries. What does it mean to be patriotic in European countries? In the Americas? In Africa? National identities and attitudes are as varied as the countries they're found in.

, Learning the history of your country is helpful, but it's also important to stay up to date on what your country is doing in the here and now. Your nation may be quite old, with a rich history, as in the case of Japan or France, or relatively new, with a fresh sense of self, as in the case of the United States.


Find causes you believe in. What issues affect your country today? What are the most important problems facing your nation?
Learn about your country's foreign policy. How does your country relate to the world? What role does your country play in its region?

, Who is making the decisions in your country? Do you agree or disagree with the direction in which your country is headed? If you feel patriotic about your country, make it your goal to get involved and understand what's going on.


No nation is free of faults. The United States, for examples, has a history of prejudice and racism, which still influences its culture today. Knowing this, researching this, and understanding this doesn't make you less patriotic. Know your country's past and be watchful of your government today to prevent future atrocities and abuses of power.

, If you care about the place you live, get involved on the local level. Vote locally if you participate in a direct or representative democracy system, or otherwise find a way to let your voice be heard. Talk to your town leaders or elders, and find out who makes the decisions around you.


This doesn't have to be a big deal. If you feel patriotic, just talking to your neighbors and looking out for people can be a sign of this. Influence the way things go down in your neighborhood. Make it a safe place you're proud to call home. That's patriotism.

, Increasingly, it can be difficult to find ""objective"" information. Everything seems to have a bias to it, and it can be hard to know what perspective you're actually reading. Do your best to examine issues from multiple angles, taking into consideration the people doing the reporting. Who stands to gain from a particular perspective? Who stands to lose?

, If you feel like showing your patriotism with dress, bumper stickers, flags, and other displays, then go for it. National holidays and other important dates in your nation's history are great times to let everyone know where you come from and how proud you are of it.


In some countries, flags are commonly flown outside of homes in support of the nation. In others, this would be a strange sight. It doesn't make the residents of the latter home any less patriotic.
Displays are the cheapest form of patriotism. It takes more than a symbol to be really patriotic. It's fine to show it, but never question anyone else's patriotism for not showing it.

, Every country has positive qualities and negative qualities, and no one national identity is superior to another. Loving a nation doesnt mean you should ignore or stay silent about its failures. It is important to be informed. It's also perfectly acceptable to love your country for its cultural heritage, its successes, and its unique character, in spite of its shortcomings by emphasizing the positive and working towards a better future for all who call your nation home.

These are all great points but i must add that giving memorable best man speeches makes one a great best man no matter how unpleasant that responsibility might be.Here are tested tips to help you do just that


,Change your views about public speaking because they influence your choice of words

",How to Be a Great Best Man," Thankfully, you can pretty much stay out of the wedding planning, but you should offer to help the groom with anything he might need, particularly if you live nearby. You will most likely need to get measured for your tuxedo well in advance.;
, If yes, great. (If not, see step 3.) The party is the first of your responsibilities. It's generally held a few days or a week before the wedding, but coordinate with the groom to figure out the best time. The best man is usually in charge of all planning, though some tasks can be delegated to the groomsmen who should also help you pay. The party could range from a barbecue to Vegas debauchery. The plans are usually hidden (at least somewhat) from the groom, so consider what he would like, as a guide. But, start arranging and inviting ASAP.

, Make sure everyone has their tuxedos and that they have all tried them on. Brief them on how to usher guests at the wedding and on where and how they are to stand during the ceremony.

, On the big day, you should be ready to provide the groom with all the moral support he needs. You should also make sure he looks sharp, by straightening his bow tie or making sure his cuff links are on right, for example. Most importantly, a best man must make sure the groom gets to the wedding on time. In addition, there are some other small, but very important, duties you'll usually need to take care of:


Get a check, usually from the groom, to give to the officiant after the ceremony. You may also need to give checks (again, not your own) to the DJ or photographer.
Make sure the groom brings the marriage license to the ceremony. In most jurisdictions, the officiant will need to sign the marriage license or certificate after the ceremony in order to legally marry the bride and groom. You will probably be in charge of holding onto this document, and you should also offer to sign it as a witness after the ceremony.
Make sure you have the ring(s). On wedding day, you are the caretaker of the bride's ring and often the groom's ring, as well. Make sure you have the rings with you at the ceremony. Take every precaution not to lose them.
Make sure everything is in order. Perform any last minute tasks necessary to get the wedding location, the families, or the guests ready for the ceremony. Offer to help in whatever way you can. Keep an eye out for potential disasters, and act quickly to remedy them. The bride's mother will also usually be able to think of a few things for you to do.

, Typically you'll escort the maid of honor up the aisle and then await the groom and, finally, the bride. Depending on the ceremony, you may have to stand up there for awhile. Look sharp and dignified, stand up straight, don't make faces, and don't shuffle about.

, If you're holding only the groom's ring, you will generally give it to him directly. If you're holding both rings, you'll probably give them to the officiant or to the bride and groom individually. Don't worry about the timing, as this will be covered in the rehearsal. Do worry about making sure you have the ring(s), and avoid fumbling to find it/them.

, If any last-minute arrangements are required, you should take care of them. Greet the guests as they arrive and make sure they are ready for the bride and groom's grand entrance.

, For most people, this is the most frightening part of being a best man. It will go a lot smoother if you prepare your toast in advance. It's also a good idea to carry some notes with you, even if you've memorized your toast. You don't want to read the toast word-for-word, but you also don't want to forget anything important. Look good and speak loud enough for everyone to hear you.

, Perhaps at previous weddings you've been deliriously drunk an hour into the reception. Not this time. When the dancing starts, you should usually try to dance with the bride's mother, the bride, the maid of honor, and the bride's other attendants if possible. Be attentive to the needs of the bride and groom, and assist them in any way possible to ensure they can thoroughly enjoy the reception.

, At some point during the reception, sneak out to the car or limo in which the bride and groom will leave and decorate it, usually with the groomsmen. You can tie some cans on the bumper and write just married on the back window, or you can be more creative. This is a good time to finally unwind and play a harmless practical joke on the new couple.

, If the tuxedos are rented, you absolutely need to make sure they're back on time. If the groom owns his tuxedo, you should take it to be dry cleaned.

, Make travel arrangements to get the newlyweds to the airport for their honeymoon, or drive them yourself.

Pick candy for the buffet.,
Order enough candy so the buffet is full and each guest gets a share.,
Be considerate of those with dietary concerns.,
Choose glassware, crystal ware, and other suitably beautiful containers to hold the candies.,
Purchase containers for the guests to take home candy from the buffet.,
Decorate the buffet table.",How to Prepare a Candy Buffet for Your Wedding," Sit down with a notebook and your partner to decide together what sorts of candies you'd like to have at the wedding reception. You'll both have favorites, so take each other's preferences into account when planning. Choices can be based on the wedding couple’s favorites, the color scheme of the wedding, or the way the candies complement the dessert or wedding cake being served. Given the breadth of possibilities, be sure to do the planning of the candy buffet in conjunction with the food planning, reception layout and color choices.


Bear in mind that coordinated candy colors look more effective than a random mismatch of different types of candy.
Consider a centerpiece, such as a chocolate fountain. While it isn't necessary, it's a lot of fun and it might be something of which you've always dreamed!;
, About 7 to 10 different types of candy is a good variety and around 15-20 pounds (7-9 kilograms) of each variety should be enough to cater for a medium-size wedding.Too many candies is not a problem but too few will be! Extra candy can be taken home by the guests as a fun and memorable take-home sweet memento. A good rule of thumb is to order between .2 and .25 pounds of candy per guest. For an event with 100 guest you should plan to have round 20-25 pounds of candy.


Buying candy locally is often less expensive than ordering candy through the mail or online but check the prices, as some discount retailers online might send free of charge or at a very cheap rate. Alternatively, you might like to browse online but then collect the candies direct from the source to save on delivery costs.

, Some dietary considerations should be taken into account when preparing the candy buffet as this might be bad for some people. For those candies that are provided specifically for certain dietary needs, be sure to label them so that all of the guests are aware. Things you might like to consider include:



Gluten-free candies for those with gluten intolerance.

Vegan/vegetarian candies (no gelatin, no animal derivatives, no dairy, etc.)
Sugar-free candies. Not everyone is a fan of sugar but most people still like sweetness. Look for a few sugar-free treats.
Health food crowd and diabetics: Provide a few dried fruits and nuts for those who think candies are only for kids or who cannot eat sugary treats.

, Select containers of varied heights and shapes that match well with the theme and quality of items being used for the reception.


Add tongs and scoops for the guests to use. Many of these items can be hired from catering specialists if your reception venue doesn't already have them. A florist might also be able to assist.
Some couples match the containers with the flower vases., Have paper lunch bags, half-pint takeout containers, cellophane or glassine bags available at the buffet.

, Accentuate the buffet with balloons, ribbons, flowers, and small figurines or other objects that fit in with your wedding theme. Candles are another good choice, and consider adding a few photos from your engagement or from your times as children along the table.


To help guests know what they're choosing, put labels on the containers of candy.
Wrap the containers with ribbon, curling ribbon, and bows.

Use recycled or non-tree based paper for invitations.,
Book a calligrapher to write on your recycled paper.,
Eliminate paper where you can.,
Rent all your linens, glassware, and utensils.,
Wear vintage dresses, suits, and jewelry.,
Rent your outfits.,
Encourage your wedding party to follow your lead.,
Purchase antique wedding rings.",How to Have a Green Wedding1," Whether you make you own invitations or use a service, be sure that the paper is eco-friendly. Many providers will give you the option of choosing alternative paper materials, such as bamboo, soy, or hemp.If you’re feeling especially ambitious, try making your own paper from your old newspapers and scrap paper. You can even press petals into the paper.;
, Hand-scripted invitations will be lovely and unique. This method also eliminates the energy used in the normal printing process. In addition, if you’re able to use a local calligrapher, you can support your town’s economy with your business., Send out evites and create a personalized wedding website If you’re willing to completely forgo paper invitations and save-the-dates. Your wedding website can include all the necessary instructions that would normally be sent in an invitation, as well as extra information about local hotels and activities.


You can also skip paper name placards and table signs by writing the necessary words on stones or reusable objects, such as small flower pots.

, Rather than using disposable materials, rent your party items from a rental service. Many of these companies expressly commit to using green cleaning practices. Even if you can’t find a “green” rental company, it’s much better to reuse than dispose of these items., The more you’re able to limit your purchases of new items, the smaller your environmental impact will be. If you have access to a family gown and tuxedo, see if they can be altered to fit your needs. There’s also nothing better than getting to wear family heirlooms on your big day. Reach out to family members, and see what people are willing to lend you!If your family’s collection isn’t cutting it, you might also be able to find the perfect outfits by looking in thrift stores. This may require some patience and browsing, but the result could be lovely - and eco-friendly!

, If you’re set on a newer style, you can rent your gown and suit for the day. Because others will be able to wear these outfits after you, this practice also adheres to your principle of reusing everything you can on the big day. Not only does renting limit the overall production of new clothing, it’ll also keep you from dedicating a corner of your closet to a something you’ll almost certainly never wear again.There are several companies dedicated to fulfilling your rental needs while also providing you with beautiful designer gowns. Check out Rent the Runway, and ask local bridal shops if they have rental options for their dresses.

, Ask your bridesmaids and groomsmen to either wear items they already own, or to employ a rental service. If you let them pick from their own closets, they’ll probably never stop thanking you for letting them save their money.If you’re worried about having coordinated pictures of your wedding party, you can still suggest a general color palette and style. If you can, however, try embracing everyone’s unique colors and styles. It’ll make your wedding more memorable and fun.

, The mining of gold, diamonds, and other precious metals leaves environmental devastation in its wake. Either look in thrift shops for antiques you can have resized, or ask your family about your options for heirloom wedding rings. See if there is unused gold jewelry that could be melted down for new rings."

Limit your guests.,
Choose a spot that’s close to as many guests as possible.,
Pick one venue for the reception and the ceremony.,

Honeymoon locally.",How to Have a Green Wedding2," More guests equals more impact from travel, in addition to the extra environmental costs of food and other materials. Go for a more intimate affair. You’ll be able to spend extra time with all of your family and friends, and you’ll have more freedom to focus on each other.You might consider starting with just family members. If this leaves you with some extra space, give each other 5-10 “spots” for a select group of very close friends. Explain to those who might feel left out why you’re keeping it small, and promise them that you’ll celebrate the next time you’re able to get together.

, While it’s likely impossible to have a wedding that’s close to all of your guests, try to identify the area where the majority or highest number of your guests live. If you’re able to have your wedding in that spot, you’ll significantly reduce the amount of travel your wedding causes.

, You’ll want to ensure that you and your guests don’t add to your travel on the wedding day itself. There are many venues that can provide ceremonies and receptions on the same grounds, even if you’d like a religious service.

, Help your guests get connected online by creating a special Facebook group or message board. Encourage your friends and family to participate in carpools, and provide information and links to local public transportation options., If you order food and flowers that are out of season or can’t be produced in your area, it also needs to travel. Visit local butchers, florists, bakers, and other providers to see if they can help you gather food and flowers that are all produced within a reasonable distance of the venue.Not all local food and flowers will be organic. Ask farmers and growers if they have organic produce that hasn’t been treated with pesticides or herbicides.

, If you’re able to honeymoon without taking a plane to your destination, you’ll significantly cut down on your impact. There are likely many options for a lovely and relaxing honeymoon within driving distance. You’ll also be able to use the money you would have spent on a plane ticket pampering yourselves!If you want to travel longer distances, keep it eco-friendly and make it part of the fun. You can travel by train or even sailboat rather than by plane.
You might also consider traveling to a “green” honeymoon destination. There are a variety of websites you can use to pick a spot, including GreenGlobe.travel and GreenPearls.com.

Pick a venue that benefits from natural lighting.,
Plan a low-meat or meat-free menu.,
Purchase fair trade and ethically harvested food, drink, and flowers.,
Set out potted plants as centerpieces.,
Use alternative materials for your bouquets and centerpieces.,
Pick caterers and bakers with environmentally friendly plans.,
Donate or freeze excess food.,
Go digital for your photographs.",How to Have a Green Wedding3," If you’re able to plan an outdoor wedding during the day or early evening, you can enjoy a completely naturally lit wedding. If you want an indoor affair, try to book a spot with large windows and encourage the organizers to limit their use of the electrical lighting.


For both indoor and outdoor weddings, you may need to supplement the natural light. To do this in a particularly lovely way, light different sized candles and spread them throughout the space.

, Meat production, especially of red meat, has a high environmental cost. There are many vegetarian options that can delight your guests while also satisfying your desire to help the planet. Consider pasta dishes, salads, and elegant but meat-free finger foods.You can make your menu meat-free from start to finish. Start with deep-fried goat cheese, mozzarella risotto balls, and an elaborate crudité platter filled with cut vegetables. Move on to a caprese salad and some marinated portabella mushrooms for the main course. You can supplement the meal with side options such as eggplant fritters or baked polenta., The harvesting of many vegetables, flowers, and other items worldwide is often conducted by workers experiencing exploitative conditions. Do research to find out if the providers you’re using adhere to fair and equitable work standards.Check the labels of the food you buy and see if it’s certified as “Fair Trade.” The non-profit Fair Trade USA is a reliable certifier of suppliers both in and outside of the United States. Even when purchasing at farmer’s markets, be sure to ask your suppliers questions not just about the organic and local quality of the food, but also the working conditions of their laborers., Rather than decorating the tables with flower arrangements that will die in a few days or weeks, choose potted plants and flowers that you and your guests can take home and plant. Your wedding decorations could become part of gardens that attendees can enjoy for years to come., Instead of flowers, consider materials that could be either reused or disposed of safely. Try a bouquet of unique and colorful vegetables that could be eaten after the ceremony, and place stones and pebbles on the tables., Be sure your caterer and baker plan to use only edible decorations on their food. Work with them to ensure that there will be a minimal amount of leftover food. You’ll also want to hire providers who compost all of their biodegradable waste., The most important goal of your wedding day should be to ensure that nothing is thrown away that could be reused. Food is often disposed of when it could be given to those in need. You and your guests may also want to take home leftovers, as this could save you a few nights of cooking weeks or even months later.

, Book a photographer who uses a digital camera and will commit to giving you digital, rather than paper, prints. You can also ask your photographer if they’re willing to use a printing lab that adheres to environmental printing practices and is certified by the Forestry Stewardship Council.Don’t give your guests disposable cameras. While this is a sweet and cute idea, it’s unnecessary in the age of smartphones, and it’s not eco-friendly.

Use a green bridal registry.,
Request charitable donations in lieu of gifts.,
Offset the environmental costs of the wedding.,
Raise awareness about the need to go green at the wedding.",How to Have a Green Wedding4," There are many online services available for setting up a green registry, including Viva Terra, Branch, and Gaiam. This will help your guests purchase a variety of eco-friendly items as gifts. Try to limit your registry to only what you need, however, as even eco-friendly production has an impact.If there is a store you like that sells eco-friendly products but doesn't have a bridal registry, ask if they can set one up for you. It might just be the impetus the store needs to do it regularly.

, Consider choosing charitable causes and organizations that your guests can make donations to instead of buying you gifts. You can pick a variety of options that will allow your guests to support environmental, educational, or social causes.

, Use a carbon calculator to figure out the exact impact of the wedding. You can factor in how many guests you’re inviting and their travel needs. Add the cost of purchasing this carbon offset to the overall budget of the wedding.There are a variety of online services you can use to calculate and purchase your carbon offset. , Your wedding itself will raise awareness of the importance of committing to eco-friendly practices. You can do more by adding information about your motivations and intent to your invitations, or on explanatory cards placed on the tables.Be sure to print this information on recycled paper or send it out digitally.

Make sure your parents are on board, even if you're paying for the nuptials.,
Select a ghoulish location.,
Secure a team of professionals to transform your wedding from ho hum to zombie couture.,
Choose appropriate flowers.,
Find a caterer to create fun, zombie-like fare.,
Stage some drama.,
Warn your guests that they will be part of a “zombie invasion.” In order to make sure everyone has a great time, clue your guests in on what will happen at your wedding.",How to Have a Zombie Wedding Ceremony," Keep in mind that weddings are also made for the parents, no matter who is paying. They want to celebrate your marriage almost as much as (and sometimes even more than) you.


Approach the subject with care. Let them know that you want to have fun with your wedding and desire something out of the ordinary. Remind them of your love of zombie culture/flicks and your desire to inject a little shock value into your big day.
Ask them to be part of the planning. Mom may have some hidden talent like making fake blood or finding a creative caterer. If you invite them to be part of it, they may be more accepting (and realize how much fun your wedding will be).;
, Part of having the ideal zombie wedding is to secure a ghastly location. You want your guests to feel as if the end of the world occurred or is near––so why not party down?


Cemetery. Not the most ideal place for a regular wedding, a cemetery is actually the quintessential location for a zombie wedding. Contact the cemetery caretaker to inquire about parties and locations that would be ripe for your “I do’s.” However, be respectful if your party takes place anywhere near a burial––or talk to the caretaker to ensure that doesn’t occur. Realize that it might upset some of your guests and anyone attending the cemetery to witness a wedding in a cemetery. Consider who you're inviting before choosing this location.

An alternative to a cemetery is to find a field that looks a little creepy or overgrown and to put in fake grave markers.


Abandoned motel, house or shopping center. For the ultimate in post-apocalyptic horror, choose a location that appears to have been ravaged by zombies. As with any location, you’ll need to obtain permission from the property owners and possibly (and most likely) pay a fee. If the property is abandoned you may want to hire an independent contractor to conduct a structural inspection to identify any actual hazards––you only want implied danger and not a situation where you or a guest could become injured. Another alternative is to make a set that mimics an abandoned building and have it as part of the wedding decorations.
A creepy club. Some warehouses and indie clubs offer an uber-creepy locale. In fact, many locations are prepped and ready for dancing and dining, so inquire about all services and amenities.
Another approach is to have the wedding ceremony free of zombies but to bring them on for the reception, from building and decorations to cake and zombie-fied music. In this case, you might like to factor in a change of clothing in between the ceremony and the reception.

, You may need to go that extra mile to make your zombie wedding realistic. Instead of having traditional flowers and make-up, you’ll need to make sure you're working with a team of professionals who have experience with monster transformations and are on board with your vision.


Clothing. Consider going to a secondhand store for the bride’s dress, bridesmaid’s dresses, grooms’ and groomsmen tuxes. Find an outfit you like and then trash it––you're a zombie so you're annoyed with your outfit anyway. One stylish consideration is to go retro and get electric blue ruffled tux shirts and big taffeta, mauve dresses. Slash the clothing and cover outfits with fake blood. All clothing should be hacked, including the bride’s dress.
Hair. In post-apocalyptic times, hair may not be a priority. In fact it may even look electrifying. Study zombie movies to get the right look; typically, zombies look like they're wearing a rat’s nest on top of their head, so go for the ultimate in zombie hair. To add an extra element of creepy, find a crazy tiara for the bride to wear, dripping with blood and/or fake brains.
Make-up. Since you and your bridal party are basically dead and seeking brains for sustenance, you’ll have more of a green pallor to your face. A trained make-up artist can do the job, however some make-up artists at local salons may be totally into your idea. Consider visiting the local art school for students willing to help or do it yourself by referring to your favorite zombie film and using white pancake make up and black charcoal to hollow out your eyes.
Photography. Reconsider spending thousands of dollars on a traditional wedding photographer––you're going for more artsy, rad photos. Consider hiring a photographer who specializes in photographing bands or even a photo journalist. As with the make-up the local art school may produce willing and talented photographers.
Music. Strike a balance between playing “Here Comes the Bride” and the funeral march and include a variety of music and themes during the ceremony and reception. Consider hiring a band or DJ willing to go along with your theme and dress in full zombie garb.

, Of course dead flowers would be appropriate for a zombie affair, but since you don’t want to include the stench of death as part of your nuptials, select a florist that can pull off that dead flower, end-of-the-world flower arrangement and still allow you to come out smelling like a rose.

, The food is where you can have a lot of fun during a zombie wedding. However, you want your guests to actually eat what you're serving so while you may want to serve food that look like brains and guts, ask your caterer to create fare that is also distinctly appetizing.


Brain topped wedding cake. Top a traditional white wedding cake with a large oozing brain made from marzipan or royal icing. Drip blood down the sides of the pristine white wedding cake to give the appearance that someone has just lopped a brain on top of the cake. See also How to Make an Anatomically Correct Brain Cake.
Food that looks like body parts. From “lady fingers” to Sloppy Joes, select food that represents the zombie theme. Other ideas include deep green guacamole and blood red chips, green or red gazpacho and goat cheese balls. Your caterer may have a few creative suggestions to make your zombie party a hit.
For guest gifts, have candies made that look like zombie parts.

, Take your wedding beyond just the “I do’s” and add a bit of drama to the event. Find ways to surprise, thrill and excite your guests so they’ll be talking about your wedding for years to come. Some ideas include:


Funeral. Lay to rest your life as a single person and host a funeral for your “lost youth” or “single days.” You could even enter in coffins and have funeral wreaths placed around the altar as your family and friends give you a zombie inspired send-off.
Attack your guests. You may not want to completely freak your guests out, so make sure if you stage a zombie attack that it's done with a little humor. For example, have the attack performed by a bunch of zombie drag queens who want new shoes instead of brains.
Stage a rendition of “Thriller.” The classic Michael Jackson video “Thriller” was a zombie paradise of dancing and grooving. Purchase a copy of the video and encourage your wedding party to learn the dance moves. During mid-reception, bust out on the dance floor and give your guests your version of “Thriller” that they won’t soon forget.

,


Send “blood-soaked” invitations. Have fun with the invitations and drip fake blood over the invite and rip or burn them for effect. Include information about the nuptials and elude to a theme.
Suggest that guests get in on the fun. Your pictures will look authentic if your guests come dressed as zombies. Let guests know that they're invited to take part in the fun and even offer to set up hair and make-up artists outside the venue a few hours beforehand to deck out the guests.
Consider leaving the children at home. Unless you plan to keep the wedding rated “G”, you may want to let guests know that children should be kept away. You don’t want to responsible for your cousin’s child having post traumatic stress disorder after the event.

Stay flexible about where you're going to go.,
Try Canada or Mexico.,
Check the airline sites and your usual travel booking sites for last-minute deals.,
Be aware of the increases in costs while traveling over the Memorial Day weekend.,
Be patient.,
Be prepared to enjoy your weekend, whatever happens.",How to Plan a Last Minute Memorial Day Weekend Getaway," If you don't have a specific place or destination in mind, this will free up more options about where you can enjoy your weekend. While your usual favorite vacation spot might be booked to the hilt, treat this as an opportunity to discover somewhere new. As such, when searching for places to visit and stay, be prepared to say yes to destinations that are showing up as ""available"".;
, If your desired destination in the USA is booked out, as well as your second and third choice destinations, move farther afield and visit over the border. Destinations in Canada and Mexico are not as likely to be as booked out for this weekend.


Although Canada is celebrating Victoria Day on the same day, Canada's peak tourist season doesn't get underway for another two weeks (mid-June).

, Again, be flexible as to where you might end up but if you can grab yourself a flight at a great price that goes somewhere interesting, your mystery weekend can be a lot of fun! Just be sure to check that accommodations are also available at the other end (or perhaps you have family or friends who need some housesitting done).

, The price of fuel, dining, hotel charges, and events might be more over the weekend. You will need to budget for these possible increases or find ways to work around them:


If you've managed to score a hotel room at a premium destination, be aware that there may be additional hidden charges added in, such as internet access costs, etc.
Be on the lookout for discount gas stations or use your fuel coupons as you drive; fuel prices tend to go up a lot over the Memorial Day weekend.
Realize that dining will be both packed and possibly price-hiked. Many of the most popular restaurants will probably be booked out, so you need to strategize. Call ahead to see if there are any vacancies, and consider changing from dinner to lunch for your main meal, or turning up much later for a meal than you would normally. In terms of price increases, you'll either need to be ready to wear them, or you could mix up one or two expensive meals with lots of supermarket picnics or fast food take-outs.

, In some places you will experience a lot of waiting, from queues for ice cream and rides, to long traffic tails as everyone leaves for the destination and returns from it at the same time. This might be another reason for foregoing your usual destination and finding somewhere less frequented.

, It can be very disappointing and frustrating to realize that you've left long weekend vacation planning to the last minute. Fuming over it won't change it though, and it's best to just expect to get the most out of the weekend and to enjoy the choices you are able to make. Whether it's a flight to Acapulco, a trip to an unknown US destination, or simply a leisurely daily amble down to your local festive park, make the most of it and remember the purpose behind the weekend.


Consider holding a brunch for your neighbors or friends who also didn't plan to go away on time. Make the most of the lovely weather and the people around you to spend time lazing about!

Enjoy some crafts at home.,
Hold your own cookout.",How to Celebrate Independence Day3," While a bonfire or campfire may not seem like a traditional celebration of Independence Day, it was actually one of the ways the day was celebrated on the first anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. They also rang bells and shot off fireworks.Before lighting a bonfire or campfire, clear the area of anything that could catch on fire. Dig an depression in a circle to help contain the fire, and place stones around the outside. Also, have a fire extinguisher or water on hand to put out any sparks.
Of course, make sure to check the fire codes in your area. A campfire is definitely more practical in a backyard.

, Many Americans also buy their own fireworks to shoot off, though most cities have regulations against big displays and some ban fireworks altogether. Nonetheless, if you're outside the city limits, creating your own fireworks display and lighting sparklers is a well-known 4th of July pastime.Be safe. Before shooting fireworks, clear out a fire-safe area by removing any flammable materials, such as dead leaves or grass. You can also water down the area to help prevent it from catching fire.
Make sure to have a fire extinguisher on hand, and use longer lighting devices (such as a grill lighter or fireplace matches). Read the directions, and only light one thing at a time (always on the ground). Never lean over anything you're lighting.
Check your local regulations for popping your own fireworks. Most states have laws against fireworks for personal use depending on the type or size. Some states also have laws about when you're allowed to pop fireworks; for example, most states require you to stop fireworks by midnight or 1 am.
Many of the national firework displays are shown on television, so if you don't want to shoot off your own fireworks, turn the television on.

Show punctuation some love.,
Review your use of punctuation.,
Find out some quirky facts about punctuation.,
Make wearable punctuation.,
Spot punctuation in unusual places during the day.,
Bake a cake or some cookies that feature punctuation.,
Throw a punctuation party.",How to Celebrate National Punctuation Day," If you're someone who likes to throw a comma here and a colon there without too much thought and end your sentences with a spattering of exclamation marks, it's possible you're already enamored of punctuation, albeit in a way that probably needs some revision. However, many people dread using punctuation, finding it about as useful as a locked door in front of the candy store. The reality is somewhere in between––too much punctuation can be stifling, while too little can result in all sorts of misunderstandings and not all of them amusing anecdotes of the ""eats shoots and leaves"" variety. It might help to grasp that punctuation serves as the road signs for writing that our sighs, pauses, pitch, stresses and shrieks provide in speech. Punctuation is basically a way of alerting the reader to breaks and the need for emphasis that might otherwise be missed. Punctuation deserves love because it helps your reading turn effortless and enjoyable; it ensures that fewer mistakes are made and more sense is created. The sooner you stop thinking only mystics and grammar experts have a real handle on punctuation, the sooner you can embrace its utility!


Before feeling scared, be aware that there is a lot more flexibility allowed in punctuation than you may have been taught to think. Indeed, a good way to approach punctuation is to remind yourself that it is only wrong if it distorts or hides the message you intend to put across. Put that way, it's not so scary, right?
More than anything, focus on the relationships of the parts of your sentence to the whole and how a reader can (or can't) separate the essential information from the non-essential. If you can get away without much punctuation and still retain the full sense, that's just fine.;
, Maybe you're using it with absolute perfection or maybe you're not using it at all but today is a great day to review how you're using it. It's not asking a lot of you––most grammar books deal with punctuation in the space of 10 to 20 pages, usually filled with plenty of juicy examples. But to save you even having to go to the library to find such a book, you can start your quick revision by reading How to use English punctuation properly. If you feel confident after reading this article, perhaps that's enough reviewing for now. But if you feel enthused to learn more, it's worth borrowing a grammar book that gives a little background history as well as explanatory rules––this understanding helps the rules to stick a lot better. Oh, and be sure to look for a grammar author with a sense of humor––they tend to be the norm these days, so avoid those ancient tomes that do little more than scold the uninitiated (see list in next step below).


Don't be afraid to explore how punctuation usage varies according to different style manuals and across different English speaking nations. You will have your eyes opened wide to realize that the way you use punctuation may not necessarily be the ""correct"" way somewhere else! For example, British English and American/Canadian English have exactly opposite rules on when to use full or single quotation marks.
If you really want to push your understanding, spend time looking for differences in punctuation usage between English and a second language that you speak, such as Spanish or French. What new punctuation marks does the other language have that are not used in English at all? Does it express a meaning not found in English?

, More things in English grammar are driven by what technology can and cannot do than you might realize. For example, newspaper editors were long unable to transmit brackets over newswires. Hence, what was technologically impossible started to inform the actual writing approach and they just stopped using them. Whether or not brackets are something you even want to use in your daily writing is beside the point––the stories behind punctuation can be a whole lot more fun and using the punctuation. Good places to find the lowdown on punctuation history include grammar books, decent dictionaries and online sites dedicated to all things grammatical. Here are some book suggestions to get you started (they've informed much of this article):

, Stencil a t-shirt or craft a badge that features a punctuation mark. Choose whichever mark you like the most––perhaps you're a question mark-o-phile or perhaps you prefer exclamation marks. Whatever it is, wear it boldly and be ready to engage in conversation with some fascinating facts about the wonders of the punctuation mark you're parading. Help people to discover something about punctuation that they didn't know before!


If you haven't time to whip up a t-shirt or badge, consider printing out some larger-than-usual punctuation marks and sticking them somewhere that people will take notice and stop and ask questions, like your office cubicle or door, or your bag, etc.

, Punctuation can be turned into a feature on roads, storefronts, on transportation, etc. It can also be found in more unusual places, unintended, such as in a pattern in nature or the way your cat curls her tail. Take photos of your favorites and share them with friends online.

, Learning isn't all drudgery––you can munch your way through punctuation too. Here are some tasty punctuation baked goods ideas:


Bake a cake in the shape of a question mark, comma or an exclamation mark. If you can't be bothered to fiddle with the shapes, bake two round cakes and put them together in the formation of a colon, on the same platter. Be sure to point out what it is though!
Bake cookies in the shape of question marks (as shown in the image), exclamation marks or commas. These shapes are fairly easy to shape in cookie dough––exclamation and questions marks are a little harder as you need to final dot below to complete the cookie and it can easily be lost from its partner when displaying, so use the clever line method shown in the image.
Frost cookies or cakes with punctuation marks. This is probably the easiest way to make the full range of punctuation marks without having to test your culinary skills too much.

Cut a pie topping in the shape of a punctuation mark.

, Here is where the phone gets going big time. You get to share your love of punctuation with others over all things punctuation. For this party, here are some punctuated suggestions:


Bake punctuation food as in the previous step and display on the food table. Get even more creative and cut food such as vegetables and fruit into punctuation marks. It's recommended that you get some friends to help out here or you could be at it all day.
Decorate the party room with punctuation marks. These can be printed, stitched, papier mâchéd, hand drawn, painted, whatever. Hang in strategic places. It doesn't hurt to scatter around a few grammar books as well, so that people can delve deeper into the mysteries of punctuation.
Have games focused on punctuation. You'll need to put a little effort into making the games, such as printing out etc. One example for a game is a series of sentences missing their punctuation, increasing in difficulty. Find sources of such sentences online, then print them out. Participants are timed and the person who has the most correct at the end wins a prize. Charades could be another game, only people have to act out punctuation marks and get people to guess which one they're portraying. Spot-the-incorrect punctuation mark could be the basis of another game. And if you want to make things really hard, grab different style manuals and hold a competition to see who can match the punctuation to the correct style manual. The depth of your games really depends on just how geeky your guests are when it comes to all things punctuation!
Send guests home with a little bag of cookies decorated with punctuation marks and a small grammar book (you could even make a quick booklet focused solely on punctuation).

Erect a maypole or ""May tree"".,
Try looking up some different maypole dances such as barbers pole, spiders web or Jacob's ladder.",How to Celebrate May Day1," This is usually either a young tree or a very high pole with a wreath of greens hung from the top, encircling it. Typically, long pieces of colored ribbon are attached to the top. A group of people will each grasp a piece of ribbon and dance in a circle around it, interweaving the ribbons to form a pattern around the pole. In the case of a May tree, the branches are decorated with colored ribbon.


Find a long pole or piece of wood/branch, around 10 feet or 3 meters tall.
Attach ribbons at the top using a staple gun, hammer and nails or similar. One ribbon per dancer is adequate although a spare few can be helpful if you expect extra people to turn up. The ribbons should be about three quarters the length of the pole, long enough for the dancers to grab hold of but not so long they're tripping over them (and keep the height of any children in mind). You can decorate the top of the pole if you like (to cover up the nails or staples) but it's not essential.
Fresh flowers can be woven around the ribbons at the top for a spring feel.
Dig a hole deep enough in the ground to hold the pole without swaying. Secure it in place with dirt infill. Get some help with this part, as it's hard work digging a hole and holding the pole in place while infilling with dirt.
Invite your friends over. Teach them how to dance around the maypole. There's no need to seek perfection, it takes quite a while to get it right––just have a lot of fun trying.
If you're really into the May Day celebrations, crown a May Queen as well. Traditionally, the lucky lady gets to sit in a chair (throne) decorated with fresh flowers and doesn't have to participate in the dancing or games. Prepare a fresh floral crown for her head if you're crowning a May Queen.;
, Feel free to contact The Heage Windmillers on Facebook or Twitter with any maypole dancing queries.

Make a bonfire.",How to Celebrate May Day2," In the Germanic cultures, bonfires were made for May Day and herds of cattle driven between them to rid them from evil spirits and protect them from harm. Fires are still burned on May eve, the night between April 30 and May 1, today.


Naturally, don't start bonfires without first knowing that it's okay according to local regulations. And be sure to properly account for the weather conditions, to avoid the potential for out-of-control burning.

""Dance into the May"".,
Go out dancing.,
Look for a group giving a display of Morris dancing.,
Morris dancing largely consists of six different varieties.",How to Celebrate May Day3," In Germany, for example, it is common to hold a dance on the night of April 30 that lasts past midnight. This is known as ""Tanz in den Mai"".

, Choose wherever you most like going out to dance and treat this as an excuse for a special ""May 1st"" dance celebration.

, This is a traditional English dance often seen for May Day celebrations. If you're lucky, they might even give lessons for the day!

,


Cotswold Morris uses either stick or handkerchiefs accompanying hand movements.
North West Morris has a military style shown by the precise movements.
Border morris is a more vigorous (and occasionally more dangerous) style of morris using sticks. Dancer often have blackened faces and rag coats for this style of dance.
Longsword dancing uses long rigid lengths of wood. It is often performed by older men at a slow pace though groups such as The Demon Barbers have challenged this stereotype.
Rapper sword dancing originated in the pubs surrounding the English mines after the working day ended. The swords (used to scrape soot from mine ponies backs) would be held by each handle joining five men in a circle. The idea was to jump or somersault over, move under and twist between the swords whilst being extremely drunk. The tradition continues in the form of DERT, the national competition which travels around the country.
Molly dancing was performed when work was scarce in an effort to receive payment for the spectacle.

Make ""May punch"".,
Make a May Day picnic.",How to Celebrate May Day4," A traditional drink to consume on May eve is May punch, a punch made using fresh strawberries (which are in season), white wine, soda water or lemonade (to taste) and woodruff (since real woodruff is said to have carcinogenic qualities, many people prefer to use artificial aroma for this part). Pour the wine over the herb. It is not added to the punch bowl.


Of course you can make the punch without alcohol, if you prefer. In that case, white grape juice can be substituted for the wine.

, For a May Day picnic, rely on the seasonally available fruits and vegetables to make the most of their fresh taste. In the northern hemisphere, strawberries, blueberries, plums, broccoli and snow peas are just some of the delightful produce you can turn into salads, dishes and desserts.

"
"
Use May Day as a prompt to brighten up your garden.,
Bring flowers into the house.,
Make beautiful floral arrangements or floral crowns.,
Hang baskets of fresh flowers on the doorknobs of your neighbors' houses.",How to Celebrate May Day5," Visit your local garden center and buy a few punnets or containers of your favorite flowers, already in bloom. This will cheer up the garden immediately and give you a sense that spring is full of promise.


If you're a green green thumb, check out How to plant flowers.

, Pick your favorite flowers from the garden or purchase some locally grown ones from the florist. Arrange them in vases inside your house and perhaps also at your workplace, to share the spring cheer.


If you're in the southern hemisphere, bring in autumnal flowers and color-changing leaves.

, If you love crafting things, turn your cut flowers into elaborate floral arrangements or weave them into floral leis or crowns for wearing on May Day.

, Baskets of flowers were often given out in older May Day celebrations and could also include a small gift.However, this must be done without being seen––if caught, your neighbor can apparently claim a kiss!

"
"
Attempt divination.,
Make a wreath of daisies.",How to Celebrate May Day6," May eve is said to be a time when the spirit world and the physical world are close together. Folk divination methods can be done for fun in the evening, for example peeling an apple with a knife, so that the peel stays in one piece. Then cut the apple in half and eat half of it with your back to a mirror. Throw the other half over your left shoulder and quickly turn to face the mirror. It is said to then reveal your future partners face looking over your shoulder.


Alternatively, you can go out at dusk and gather nine flowers (each of a different type). Tie them up with a string and place them under your pillow. It is believed to reveal your future mate in your dreams.

, Wearing the wreath on your head past midnight on May eve can attract good luck and keep away mischievous fairies.

Study the origins of the word.,
Learn about umbrella superstition.,
Consider the many styles and sizes of umbrellas.,
Count how many umbrellas you own.,
Learn how to care for umbrellas.,
See what other uses can be made of an umbrella.,
Transform your umbrella.,
Take your umbrella out with you today.",How to Celebrate National Umbrella Day," Evolving from the Latin word, umbra, meaning ""shadow"" or ""shaded"" and the term umbrella, which is a flat-topped rounded flower, the resulting term ""umbrella"" is a combination of both the object's shape and function.
, Aside from the common courtesy of avoiding poking anyone in the eye, it is a well-known superstition that if you opens an umbrella indoors, you will be subject to bad luck. The legend goes back to how indoor opening of an umbrella affects and offends the sun god (because umbrellas were used to shield the sun).What other superstitions can you find with respect to umbrellas?

, There are broad umbrellas designed to keep off a heavy run, there are cloth umbrellas designed to shade people from the sun's searing rays and there are umbrellas that fold up neatly to fit inside a purse. Cafes use large outdoor umbrellas to allow customers to sit under shade or keep out the rain when dining outside. Large beach umbrellas keep swimmers and beach visitors out of the sun and just a little cooler for the shade.


Be aware that umbrella fabrics are chosen dependent on their end use. For example, an umbrella meant to ward off rain won't last long if it's used to keep off the sun's rays, as the fabric isn't made for that second purpose. Be sure to choose the right umbrella for the purpose.

, Do you use them for keeping dry only, or do you also use them as a form of shading your face and body on a sunny day? Perhaps today is a good time to revisit your impression of the utility of the umbrella––perhaps add one to your garden for shade or buy a new one for shading you in the summer heat.


If you live in a windy area, look for a very strong umbrella. However, be aware that umbrellas are not intended for use in strong winds or torrential rain––they tend to snap or blow inside out!

, Do you know what to do after using an umbrella? Rather than simply folding it up wet, there are simple procedures to keep your umbrella in tip top shape:


Upon reaching your destination, find a spot to keep your umbrella opened out. Ideal spots include the bathtub, a mudroom, a basement, sitting on industrial carpet in the office that can handle a little moisture, a sink, and so forth.
When dry, fold the umbrella according to the manufacturer's instructions and place it back into its pouch or do up the fastener. When folding, take care with the spokes to avoid bending them out of shape. Have any broken spokes mended by a shoe repairer as quickly as possible, or the umbrella will not last. Also, roll the umbrella back into its case, rather than stuffing or squashing it in. Creases that result from squashing the umbrella fabric are hard to remove and decrease the umbrella's life.
Obviously, you can't always leave an umbrella open to dry out. If you cannot find somewhere to dry out the umbrella immediately, give it a quick shake to remove the worst of the water, then fold. Do not leave it too long––as soon as you're able to open it up for drying, do so. If left stored wet, it may grow mildew.
If stains or marks appear on the umbrella, use a toweling cloth with warm water to dab at the marks. If you need something stronger, try gentle dish washing soap but nothing harsher, as this may discolor or even destroy the umbrella fabric.

, While most umbrellas are used to keep us dry or shaded, there are other uses for umbrellas (or their shape):


Unopened, a non-folding umbrella with a strong stem can transform into a temporary walking cane substitute.
Umbrellas can be used to provide temporary shade or protection for new growing plants in the garden. Be sure to weight down the hook end or the umbrella might fly off in a gust.
Umbrellas can be used in photo shoots to give the impression of rain or heat. They're a handy prop for models to work with.
The common plastic or wooden umbrella garnish, inspired by the real umbrella, is used as a decoration in drinks such as cocktails and children's party drinks. It will often have pieces of fruit skewered on the stem too.

, Do you have some unwanted umbrellas around the house? They can have a new lease of life rather than being tossed out. Here are some ways to change your umbrella into something else:







Show off your creativity and try to make an umbrella skirt.
Turn your old umbrella into a pouch for rainy days.






Make a paper umbrella for drinks, toys, or as decorations.







Make baby shower umbrellas for the next baby shower you attend.
Turn it into an indoor, portable drying rack. Remove all the fabric and use the spokes. Simply hang the umbrella upside down over the shower, use clothes pins to attach lingerie and other light items, and wait for them to dry!, Lay out a beach towel and umbrella in the sand at the beach or open one up while walking somewhere.

Have fun with the kids. If you have a hose, create ""rain"" with it by holding your thumb on the nozzle and sprinkle water above them, while they use an umbrella. Or, if it's too cold outside for water fun, try making an umbrella tent and crawling under it together!
Indoor fun with umbrellas is possible––just draw one!

Try different serving methods.,
Experiment with different ingredient ratios.,
Give your margaritas color.,
Change a fruit.,
Use a margarita in a dessert.,
Make non-alcoholic things.",How to Celebrate National Margarita Day," Margaritas are either usually ""on the rocks"" (ingredients straight over ice cubes), shaken (with ice in another container and served), or blended (with ice in a blender).;
, Try these common measurements:

2:1:1 = 50% tequila, 25% triple sec, 25% lime/lemon juice
3:2:1 = 50% tequila, 33% triple sec, 17% lime/lemon juice
3:1:1 = 60% tequila, 20% triple sec, 20% lime/lemon juice
6:3:1 = 60% tequila, 30% triple sec, 10% lime/lemon juice
1:1:1 = 33% tequila, 33% triple sec, 33% lime/lemon juice
7:4:3 = 50% tequila, 29% triple sec, 21% lime/lemon juice

, Use different flavored liqueurs to enrich the beauty of the drink. Blue curacao is most commonly used to create the ""blue margarita"".

, While the standard margarita calls for fresh lime or lemon juice, other fruits are acceptable to substitute in the drink. Try mango, banana, apple, strawberry, or raspberry.
, Enjoy recipes such as strawberry margarita cakes and layered margarita bites.

, You don't need an actual margarita to enjoy this holiday. Create mocktail margaritas or ones using non-alcoholic ingredients."

Begin by doing a short history lesson on President's Day and the US Presidents, so that the students understand the importance of the crafts they are doing.,
Review all of the presidents of the United States, if you are working with an older class.,
Give a short quiz on United States' money.",How to Find President's Day Crafts1," For example, review the contributions made by President George Washington. You may ask your class to do research at home and raise their hands to list all of his accomplishments, or you can teach them using a textbook.;
, Do a review of all 44 presidents and give a prize to anyone who can name all 44 presidents in order after the President's Day holiday.

, Ask your students to list who is on all the major coins and bills. For a bonus question, ask if there are any figures on United States' money that were not presidents.

Buy paper painter's hats with bills on them.,
Place a picture of George Washington or the first congressional delegation before the class.,
Give each student a painter's hat, some cotton balls and some glue.,
Ask them to make a thick line of glue going from the front to the back of the hat and push cotton balls down onto the glue.,
Create a bow out of black ribbon or felt.,
Allow the cap to dry for 2 to 3 hours.",How to Find President's Day Crafts2," They should be available from hardware stores in bulk. You will also need a large bag of cotton ball, craft glue, black felt and scissors.

, Explain to them the tradition of wearing powdered wigs as a status symbol. Although only the first 5 US presidents wore wigs, barristers and judges in England still wear wigs as part of proper court dress.

, Ask the students to stuff some paper towels inside the hat to give it some shape. This will make it easier for them to press the cotton ball against the glue.

, Ask them to repeat each line of glue and cotton balls working from the front of the hat toward the back until the entire cap is covered.

, If the children are too young to handle scissors, you should make the bows on your own and hand them out. If they are older, they can tie their own ribbon with a long strip of ribbon or felt. Ask them to glue it down on the bill of their cap.

, Ask the children to put the cap on backwards, so that the ribbon is at the base of their skull. Take pictures of your little group of presidents and allow them to take the caps home.

Get a piece of red, white and brown construction paper, craft glue, scissors, popsicle sticks and pennies for every child.,
Tell the story of Abraham Lincoln's humble beginnings to your children.,
Begin to craft Lincoln's 1-room log cabin.,
Ask them to create a roof for the log cabin.,
Ask them to cut a door and a window to glue them on top of the popsicle sticks.,
Allow the glue to dry for 2 to 3 hours, and then allow them to take the craft home at the end of the day.",How to Find President's Day Crafts3," The finished product will be quite heavy, so use a piece of craft board or cardstock for the backing of the log cabin if you have the budget for it.

, He was known to have been born in a log cabin and to have worked hard to become president. Ask the children to share any other details they have researched or heard of President Lincoln.

, Ask each child to glue 8 popsicle sticks horizontally on their white craft board or construction paper backing. Show them an example of how it is done.

, They should cut a triangle roof from red or brown construction paper and glue it above the popsicle sticks.

, Ask them to glue their penny with Abraham Lincoln's face forward onto the window, as if he is looking out.

,


For more advanced ages, you can actually make a 3D Lincoln log cabin. Ask the lunch room to save all their small milk cartons for the day. Wash them out thoroughly. Cut the bottom out and tape the top edge of the milk cartons down so that you have a nice square shape.
Ask the children to cut out newspaper strips and roll them around pencils. Remove the pencil and have them tape the roll down. Have them make 30 of these rolls. Paint them brown with tempera paint and allow them to dry. Once dry, cut them and glue them onto the milk carton until you have a log cabin.

Provide a 7 inch (17.8 cm) paper plate, 2 sheets of black construction paper, glue, scissors and paint for each child.,
Paint your paper plate black.,
Align the 2 sheets of black construction paper.,
Roll the dried construction paper into a tube.,
Draw a line on your paper plate where your black construction paper tube sits on your plate.,
Place the construction paper stovepipe on top of the desk.,
Cut a circle of black construction paper or black felt and place it on top of the stovepipe.",How to Find President's Day Crafts4," After going through the history of President Lincoln, you can construct his famous stovepipe hat. Place a picture at the front of the classroom of Lincoln wearing his hat.

, Allow it to dry. Once it is dry, turn it over and paint the other side.

, Place a 2 inch (5.1 cm) strip of glue on the front of 1 sheet and press the edge of the other sheet onto it so that they are perfectly aligned. Allow the glue to dry before continuing.

, Before gluing, check that the tube is small enough when rolled so that there remains a brim on your paper plate. Put a strip of glue onto the other side of construction paper to secure the tube of black construction paper.

, Use your scissors to poke a hole in the center of the paper plate. Cut triangles into the center of the plate and fold them back.


The triangles will be formed when you cut the diameter of the circle you have just drawn both ways. Cut the triangles in half again to better secure them onto the tube (stovepipe).

, Place craft glue onto the inside triangles on the paper plate and place them on top of the paper plate. Press the glued triangles onto the inside of the stovepipe.


Working upside down on this step will make it easier to affix the paper plate to the stovepipe. Once you are finished pressing the glue onto the inside of the construction paper, you can turn it around and allow it to dry.

, Place a bead of glue around the top of the construction paper and set the circle on top. Allow the hat plenty of time to dry before using it a hat or a centerpiece.

"
Encourage participation.,
Know their triggers.,
Let them know you are there for them.,
Be discreet.,
Plan breaks in activity.,
Create an exit plan.",How to Enjoy the Holidays with Mentally Ill Loved Ones1," Some mental disorders can cause people to withdraw and isolate themselves. This is even truer during the holidays. You can help your loved ones with mental illness enjoy the holidays by inviting them to participate in events and activities.You could say, “I’d really enjoy your company at the school holiday play next weekend. I think you’ll have a good time.”
Or, you might try, “Would you come to my holiday party? I’d like you to help me teach my friends how to play bridge.”;
, Triggers are events, situations, people, or places that may cause a person with mental illness to experience a relapse or episode. If you are close to the person, ask them ahead of time about things that might be a trigger for them. Knowing what their triggers are may help you to make the person feel more comfortable. However, keep in mind that it might not be possible to completely control the situation. Just do the best that you can to be sensitive to their needs.


For example, you can ask the person if there’s anything specific about the event that might trigger an emotional crisis. For example, you might ask a friend you’re inviting to a holiday concert, “Will the noise or the crowd be a problem for you?”
You may need to ask someone else about any triggers the mentally ill person might have. For instance, you might ask, “Do you know of any situations that might cause him distress or trigger his anxiety?”

, Checking in with the person constantly may be stressful for them. Instead, let them know ahead of time that you are there for them if they need anything. You might also help the person to identify a safe space they can retreat to if they start to feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed, such as at a party or event.


If you can, ask someone close to you and the person to help you monitor how the person with mental illness is coping. You might say, “Could you help me check on him throughout the program?”

, When you invite mentally loved ones to a holiday event, it’s a good idea to check on them periodically to make sure they’re doing okay. But you don’t have to overdo it. Do what you can to respect and maintain the person’s privacy to make sure everyone is able to enjoy the event.


For instance, if you’re at a holiday dinner, never identify the person with a label like, “This is my aunt, Mamie. She has schizophrenia.” Just introduce them as you would anyone else.
Try observing the person discreetly to see how they’re coping rather than asking them. For example, you might notice whether your dad seems calm and relaxed, or is looking nervous or confused.

, Although you may want your mentally ill loved one to participate in every holiday activity on your calendar, remember to give them a break. A bit of time away from the activity can help assess how they’re doing and cope with any negative feelings they may be having.For example, you might take a quick five minute walk to the corner and back during a holiday get-together.
Or, you might plan to go to a winter brunch and then rest for a while before catching the blockbuster holiday movie.

, Even though you may not want it to happen and may try to prevent it, your mentally ill loved one may need to leave the event because they can’t cope with the situation. It will be much easier for you to quickly and quietly leave if you have an exit plan already created.


Talk to your loved one in advance about how you will know if they need or want to leave. For example, you might say, “When you say ‘I’m tired,’ I’ll know that we need to leave.”
If you need to, discreetly let the host or hostess know that you may need to leave abruptly. You might say, “I think we’ll be fine, but this might be a bit much for my guest and we may have to leave early.”

"
"
Recognize signs there’s a problem.,
Plan medication management.,
Create a support team.,
Develop a crisis plan.,
Follow-up after the visit.",How to Enjoy the Holidays with Mentally Ill Loved Ones2," Often people with mental disorders show signs that they are beginning to have a relapse or episode.They may have subtle changes in behavior and attitude that increase or intensify. Recognizing these signs early on will help you determine if something is wrong and help you get your loved one the help they need as soon as possible.


If you know what their mental illness, research signs and symptoms on a website like NIMH https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/index.shtml or SAMHSA http://www.samhsa.gov/disorders/mental.
If you don’t know exactly what their mental disorder is, look for any significant changes in behavior or attitude such as irritability, withdrawing, being overly energetic, changes in eating, or changes in sleeping. If you notice a rapid decline or the person seems to be in crisis, then you can call the SAMHSA Treatment Referral Helpline at 1 877 SAMHSA7 (1 877 726 4727) or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1 800 273 TALK (8255).

, During the holidays or any other change in routine, it may be easy for people taking medication to manage their mental illness to lapse in taking them as prescribed.Take a few minutes to find out what medications they’re taking, how often, and how much. This way you can remind them to take their medication and plan for any changes you’ll need to make to accommodate their medication schedule.


For example, if your cousin takes his anxiety medication in the evening because it makes him drowsy, you may not want to plan for a late night movie with him.
If possible, write down the medication information in case of an emergency. You can shred it after they leave, but this will be much easier than trying to locate and gather prescription bottles.

, Your loved one probably has a support team in place to help them manage their mental illness. However, they may not have access to this team if they’re away from home during the holidays. Do what you can to ensure that there are different people and forms of support for your loved one while they are visiting.


Talk to your loved one about ways to contact their regular mental health provider. You could say, “How do you contact your therapist for help outside of the office?”
Ask if their provider can recommend a temporary provider in your area. For example, you might say, “Ask Dr. Patrisik if there’s a therapist you can see in this area while you are visiting with me.”
Ask someone close to you and your loved one to help you support the person during their visit. For example, you might ask your sister, “Could you help me support mom with her dementia during her visit?”
Look into support groups in your area for your loved one. Consider online resources like online support groups and forums, also.

, In the event that your loved one has a mental illness relapse or episode while visiting you, it will be useful to have a plan in place to get them help as quickly as possible. Knowing what to look for, who to contact, and what to do will make the situation a lot less stressful for everyone involved.Talk with your loved one about who you will contact in case they have a mental health emergency. For instance, you might say, “We’ll call your therapist and then the local mental health organization.”
Keep needed information such as insurance cards, prescription information, and other treatment information in a place that is easy for you to access.
Do not wait for a special event to help someone develop a crisis plan. Sit down with them and identify a plan he/she feels comfortable with. If they are not comfortable with the plan, they may not use it. Have them write out the plan or help them to do so and make copies. The person should keep one copy with them at all times, such as in their wallet/purse or back pocket, one at home that is easily located (i.e., on fridge), and one with you and several other close family/friends.

, Although the holidays can be challenging for people with mental disorders, the time after the holidays can be equally challenging.Some people may feel distressed as life returns to normal after the excitement of the holidays. Check-in with your loved ones with mental illness after the holidays to make sure that they are coping okay.


For example, you might call a week or so after the holiday season has ended to see how they are doing and if they need any support.
Or, for instance, you might plan to spend some time with them during this time to help ease the transition.

Check with staff first.,
Be understanding.,
Be positive.,
Participate in activities.",How to Enjoy the Holidays with Mentally Ill Loved Ones3," Many mental health facilities have guidelines regarding visitation during the holidays as well as policies regarding what items can and cannot be brought in for your loved one.In addition, you can find out whether your loved one is able to or wants to have visitors. Checking with them first can help make the visit enjoyable for both you and your loved one. Many psychiatric facilities have nice family meeting areas and encourage frequent visits. Try going to see your loved one regularly, and not just on holidays.


You might call ahead and say, “I’d like to come visit my grandmother during the holidays. When is a good time to come?”
Or, you might contact the facility and say, “I’d like to bring her some presents. Is there anything I shouldn’t bring?”

, It can be challenging for someone with a mental illness having to stay in a residential treatment center, especially during the holidays. One of the ways that you can make your visit enjoyable, show that you care, and support them is to let them know you understand that this may be a difficult time for them. Don’t dismiss their negative feelings or concerns. For example, if your uncle says he hates it there, don’t say, “You’re exaggerating. It’s not that bad.” This will invalidate their feelings and probably upset them. Try to think about how you would feel in their situation and respond accordingly.
Tell them that you can understand how they are feeling, even if you know they are in the best place to get better. You might say, “I can imagine this hard, but in the end, it will be worth it.”

, One easy way to enjoy a holiday visit to a loved one in an inpatient treatment center is to stay upbeat and keep a positive attitude during the visit.Your positivity can encourage them, boost their mood, and help improve their self-confidence.


Talk to them as if they are recovering and will be going home. For example, instead of saying, “if you get out of here,” you might say, “when you’re well enough to go home.”
Avoid blaming them for being there and instead focus on encouraging them to get better.

, Many treatment centers have special programs and events for the residents and their guests during the holidays. Attending one of these activities could do a lot to help your loved one improve and show them that you care.


Ask facility staff about upcoming events. You might say, “Are you all planning any holiday events that I might attend?”
Or you can ask your loved one if they know of any holiday events coming up at the facility that you could participate in.

Be realistic.,
Take a break.,
Practice stress-reduction strategies.,
Make healthy food choices.,
Get enough sleep.,
Stay active.",How to Enjoy the Holidays with Mentally Ill Loved Ones4," We often imagine the holidays as a time when everything is perfect; everyone is smiling, happy, laughing, and loving. But, in reality, things don’t always go perfectly. You can enjoy the holidays with mentally ill loved ones if you’re realistic about what to expect.This will also help you accept the challenges and changes that are bound to occur. For example, if your dad’s in a depressive episode and wants to leave dinner early, being realistic will help you understand how he’s feeling.
For instance, it may not be realistic to ask your sister with ADHD to sit through a two-hour holiday poetry reading if she’s taking a holiday break on her medications.

, It can be easy to get so caught up in taking care of everyone else, that you neglect taking care of yourself. Take a few minutes away from holiday activities to help you relax, release tension, and re-energize.Doing this will help you enjoy the holidays with your loved ones with mental illness.


Go to a quiet room for just a few minutes. For example, if everyone is in the dining room, go into the living room for a moment or two.
Go for a walk. This is a great way to relieve tension and improve your physical health. It’s also something you can do on a regular basis during the holidays.

, The holidays can be a stressful time for anyone. It might be even more stressful as you plan to enjoy them with people you care about that have mental illness. But you can avoid becoming overly stressed by practicing techniques and strategies to manage your stress.


Deep-breathing can lower signs of stress and anxiety.Inhale slowly through your nose. Hold it for a few seconds. Then exhale slowly through your mouth.
Practicing meditation is also a good way to relax and reduce your stress. Lie or sit somewhere comfortable. Try to clear your mind and focus only on your breathing for a while.

, During the holidays it’s easy to develop bad eating habits. You may feel extra stress during this time and reach for comfort food like sweets or foods high in fats. But you will enjoy the holidays better in general (as well as the months to follow) if you make sure you are taking care of your health.Eat healthy meals and snacks so you can have the energy, focus, and calm to enjoy the holidays with your loved ones with mental disorders.
It’s okay to enjoy them in moderation, but you should also limit your intake of holiday ‘specials’ like gingerbread cookies, egg nog, and other treats.

, It’s easy to lose sleep during the holidays with all of the activities and excitement.You may also lose some sleep because of the extra effort of trying to make sure your loved ones with mental illness are also enjoying the holidays. But being tired, unfocused, and grumpy will make it difficult for you to enjoy the holidays and harder for your loved ones to enjoy being around you.


Try to go to bed and wake up at about the same time each morning.
Limit the times that you stay up or sleep in extra late. For example, try to avoid having several late nights in a row.

, The holidays seem such a busy time that it can be tempting skip physical activity. You may also feel you could be spending this time with mentally ill loved ones. But taking care of your health is a priority, also, and staying active is a great way to keep yourself fit during the holidays.Make sure you do something active like taking a five minute walk each day or stretching before you go to sleep.
Do something active with your mentally ill loved ones. For example, play basketball together, go for a swim, or go horseback riding.

Ask your hotel concierge.",How to Find Festivals and Special Events in New York,"


Web sites are typically the most up-to-date way to find out what festivals and special events are going on in New York. Use a web browser to find New York-specific web sites that list local calendars, festival schedules and details about special seasonal events in the area. Include the type of event you are looking for if you want to refine your Internet search.;
,


TKTS ticket booths are a great resource for a variety of surplus performance arts tickets. They have great last-minute deals on tickets that are between 20 and 50 percent off. These booths are located in midtown, one in lower Manhattan and in downtown Brooklyn. In order to utilize this deal, though, you'll have to be flexible and not mind waiting in line. Since this is such a popular option for tickets, the line is often several hours long.

,


Ask other residents or tourists what their favorite events are to go to in New York. Discuss the options with the server at the restaurant where you have dinner or the cab driver that takes you to the hotel from the airport. The best way to learn about festivals and special events that are well-received is to talk to people who have actually attended them.

,


Festivals and other special events will often be advertised in the local newspaper or in other city-centered publications. Pick up the most current copy to get an idea of what is going on while you are in town. Many local newspapers even offer a special entertainment edition toward the end of the week that contains an insert that outlines the activities that are going on around town.

,


It is your hotel concierge's job to help you find festivals and special events for you to go to while you are in New York. They are paid to stay informed of all of the city happenings and to give you their insider tips. Many times you can purchase admission tickets from the concierge or, if not, he or she will be able to point you in the right direction to do so.
The hotel concierge has the best of two different perspectives on which festivals and special events are the most worth it. They know from being a resident of the city that has likely been to many of these events, but they also know as someone who has a great deal of contact with tourists visiting the city and can get a good idea what the most popular events are to attend.

If you're dead set on consuming absolutely zero animal products, talk to your host.,

Know your audience.,
Offer suggestions to your host.,
Make your own dishes.,
Buy prepared dishes.,
Pounce on those veg dishes.,
Don't just eat rolls!,
Don't stress.",How to Survive Thanksgiving As a Vegetarian," You'll need to know exactly what's going into the dishes. Is there chicken broth in the stuffing? How about the gravy? And how do they feel about catering to your wishes? You know them best -- what would they respond to?


Offer to make a compromise. You can either offer to host (taking the weight off their shoulders and the pressure to stay healthy off you), offer to help cook (that way you can influence what goes in the recipes or have portions set aside pre-meat stage), or offer to bring some side dishes. You'll definitely need to plan the menu together!;
, Many vegetarians find that if they don't make a big deal of it, no one else will either. So if you're fine just using logic, reason, and a bit of coy prying (""Mmm, grandma, this looks so good! What's all in it?""), you may get through Thanksgiving without Uncle Bob waving bacon in your face. Consuming a bit of chicken stock once a year will not make the vegetarian gods take your gold star away.

, You know what your family will respond to. If Aunt Flo won't accommodate you when you say, ""I have a disturbing documentary for you to watch on the terrors of the agricultural industry, Flo,"" don't waste your time. Instead, consider saying, ""I'm trying to be as healthy as possible. Vegetarians live longer, have lower rates of heart disease and cancer, and you know about our history of high blood pressure."" In other words, speak their language. If they see your reasoning, they may be more open to compromise.


Know your pesky uncle is trying to make you smile. When you're subject to a surprising amount of Tofurkey jokes, don't be alarmed. Your awkward relatives are just trying to relate to you in any way they know how. That and, well, they may honestly just not get it. And that's fine. Smile anyway.

, Going into Thanksgiving and demanding your 94 year-old meat-and-potatoes grandma change up the Thanksgiving she's been cooking for over half a century and leaving her to the wolves is just cruel. Give her some tips! If she doesn't want you in the kitchen with her (or you bringing your own dishes), she may need some pointers.


You know the drill. Mushroom gravy. Using olive oil instead of butter. Almond milk instead of dairy. Coconut oil in the sweet potatoes. Vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. Yadda, yadda, yadda ad infinitum.
Ask for a portion to be put aside before meat or animal products get put in. That way everyone can be happy! And you're perfectly willing to join in the dividing and adding the mushroom gravy and veggie stock yourself, of course.

, If the host doesn't mind, of course. If anything, they should be grateful that you're taking some of the heat off them. And, really, veggie dishes are delicious -- other people will be eating them too!


Wonders can be had with pumpkin, potatoes, beans, and pasta dishes. Vegetarianism is really the diet of the future (preaching to the choir, eh?); you could spend days online looking at recipes before you hit your second lap.
Start your own tradition. Acorn squash, anyone? Do you have a veggie recipe you love? It could become part of your family's Thanksgiving. More and more people are becoming health concerned -- or at least trying to avoid gaining weight over the holidays!

, Many health-conscious stores (like Whole Foods) do Thanksgiving dishes (and entire meals) that are catered to vegetarians and vegans. So if you don't feel like whiling away the hours on dem Internets looking up kale and lentil recipes, know that someone else can totally do the work for you.


Whole Foods even offer Thanksgiving vegetarian cooking classes.Do you know how to massage kale? Make cashew cream? Useful stuff!

, Since you're only able to eat a portion of what's at the table, you have every right to jump on those vegetarian dishes. If you're sitting at a table of 10 and the mashed potatoes are rotating to the left, you may be subject to slim pickings by the time it makes its way over to you. It's not rude -- you need to eat!

, Just because you're vegetarian does not make you healthy. Eating a dozen rolls on turkey day and calling it good isn't the idea here. Make sure you load up on a variety of dishes (if at all possible) and get in your vitamins and nutrients. Think veggies, not rolls and dessert!

, The fact of the matter is that this is one meal. If a little meat gets in, that's 1 meal out of the thousand that you ate this year. That's .1%. The industry won't reap the benefits, the animals won't spurn you, and your vegan friends won't condemn you. While you should stick to your principles, don't let your dietary constrictions ruin your holiday! You're supposed to be giving thanks, remember?

Map out a range of activities that motivate you to get up and make the most of each day, whether it's reading, painting, art and craft, catching up on missed TV shows, visiting friends or whatever.


Do something intellectually challenging, like learning a new language or teaching yourself a field you know you're never going to study at school.
Learn a new sport. Either learn it by reading about it and practicing or find a club, group of players or a coach to help you discover a new sporting talent.;
, Visit friends and do fun things together, like roaming, chatting, visiting places such as the beach, museum. etc.


Have sleepovers and backyard camping together.
Write a book, blog or website together.
Plan and even run a small business together, to earn some money. A lemonade stand, car boot sale or craft items online are all achievable and fun options for raising a bit of cash together.

, A nap here and there will keep your mind fresh and keeps you out of the sun at the hottest time of day. You might even be able to find enough energy to party all night!

, Focus on chillaxing when you're not having fun doing things.

, For example, a favorite coffee shop, the local public swimming pool, a mall or have a picnic in the park.

, Have fun while you're keeping your cool. Take your friends with you. Be really kind and take your younger siblings too.

, Go to places where it's safe to meet people of your own age, such as during sports, at a coffee shop or at special activities, such as computer games conventions. Say hi to new people and see if you can make new friends. Take your existing friends with you and all of you can make new friends together!


There are many places where you can meet new people, such as book signings, concerts, or even public events (for example, funfairs, festivals, etc.).

, Travel is an ideal way to pass some of the summer holidays. You can travel locally, for just a day trip, or farther afield, perhaps for a few days, a week or even a few weeks. Depending on your family's budget, consider camping, staying in motels or visiting a resort.


Pack plenty of snacks and water for travel. You'll need to drink more during the hotter weather.

, If you're old enough to go away with friends and a responsible older sibling to take care of you all, this can be a fun way to enjoy time with your friends away from home. Have at least one responsible person 16 or up per every two to three of you going. It's recommended that you visit somewhere close so that you can come home quickly if needed. Or, go and visit a family farm, lakeside retreat or cottage somewhere; it can belong to any one of your friend's families.

, Summer clothing should be loose, comfortable, cool and carefree. Don't constrict yourself with tight and uncomfortable gear; this is the time for being as comfortable as possible. Cotton and wick-away garments are good for keeping your cool.


Wear a hat and sunscreen when you're out in the searing sun.

, Or a fan, or a swimming pool dip.

Identify what you can and absolutely cannot consume.,
Consider what would happen if you consumed food that could cause a reaction.,
Explore your taste buds.",How to Survive Thanksgiving with Food Allergies1," While you may be tempted to “tempt” fate getting sick or, worse heading to the ER on Thanksgiving (or any holiday) may not be the way your friends and family hoped to spend the occasion.


Scrutinize every recipe. Especially if you are cooking, segment which parts of each recipe could cause you harm and consider how you can substitute.
Ask the chef about particular foods. For example, if you have a peanut allergy give the cook a heads up about your concern so he/she can address your allergy and ensure that nothing you consume includes a damaging ingredient.
Offer to bring your own food. Why compromise everyone else’s taste buds if you can just cook at home and bring your own? You can devise recipes that are so delicious, some of the guests who don’t have a food allergy may opt for trying your fare instead.;
, While some people go into full blown anaphylactic shock others may only experience a mild irritation that could be treated with medication.


Avoid any foods that could cause you to make a trip to the ER. Anything more severe than mild skin irritation is never worth it. Avoid at all cost any food that will cause serious danger or harm.
Carry allergy medication with you to combat possible food allergies. If you experience mild skin or gastrointestinal issues and you can combat these problems with medicine, consider taking your medication beforehand and indulging.
Have an EpiPen or emergency plan on hand at all times. This includes off-holiday events as well.

, If you have a dairy allergy, for example, what other foods can be just as delicious but do not include dairy. Long before the holidays experiment in your own kitchen with different recipes and foods to uncover what may be a tasty substitute.

Go for the gluten free turkey.,
Watch for heavy cream and butter in the mashed potatoes.,
Use wheat-free bread when creating the stuffing.,
Opt for a “natural” dessert.",How to Survive Thanksgiving with Food Allergies2,"


Raw vegetables and dip are always a hit. In addition to being healthy and typically allergy free, providing raw veggies as a snack will satiate the palate without filling the stomach.
If you have a dairy allergy and don’t want to have a ranch or milk-based dip, try hummus. You can create a sesame-free recipe (if that’s an issue) by simply omitting tahini.

, This is also a “free” starter as many green salads are safe for those with food allergies. Be sure that you select a dressing that does not contain any allergens. If you can have lemon, simply squeeze an entire lemon and 1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil into a dish. Whisk together, add sea salt and pepper for a refreshing, delicious dressing.

, Many turkeys offer broth/dressing that contain wheat, which may be dangerous to some.


If you have purchased a regular turkey from your grocer, omit the gravy packet (which typically includes wheat) and make your own gravy from scratch using “safe” ingredients.

, Part of what makes this dish especially delicious, heavy cream and butter will wreak havoc on someone with a dairy allergy.


Substitute dairy ingredients with chicken broth, rice milk, olive oil and salt and pepper. You can also add butter flavored grapeseed oil to give the potatoes that traditional butter flavor.

, In many cases, the pre-seasoned stuffing is often created from white bread cubes, but read the back of the package to ensure none of the seasonings will pose a danger to you.

, While it may be tempting to reach for the store-made cupcakes with unnatural flavoring and coloring, consider serving fresh fruit or a pie that contains no wheat, eggs, dairy or nuts.

Choose quicker alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving foods.,
Purchase pre-made Thanksgiving meals.,
Remove things from your traditional Thanksgiving day menu.,
Schedule Thanksgiving dinner later in the day.,
Move Thanksgiving to a more convenient date.,
Go out to eat or get take-out.",How to Simplify Your Thanksgiving Gathering1," To simplify the work you'll have to do on Thanksgiving, consider buying alternatives to time-consuming homemade food. Purchase instant mashed potatoes instead of making them from scratch, or use packaged stuffing to save time.If you still want to cook, go minimalistic and find recipes that have only a couple ingredients per dish or aren't overly complicated to construct.


Gingery Cranberry Relish only uses three ingredients and takes around five minutes to prepare.Instead of cooking a full turkey, you could cook chicken as a faster and easier alternative.;
, Food chain stores like Whole Foods and Kroger provide freshly cooked Thanksgiving meals at their locations.Other stores like Food Lion have ready to heat up meals that you can make quickly during the holiday. You can also purchase cooked meals from chains like Boston Market who often specialize in cooking traditional Thanksgiving fare.


Other options include buying pre-prepared meals from places like Williams-Sonoma and Omaha Steaks., Write or type out a list of things that you traditionally enjoy during Thanksgiving. Divide them into perishable and non-perishable goods, then go through it and remove the things that you don't want.Make your decision based on the preferences of your guests and remove things that people usually don't eat, or that you've had extra of during previous years.


For instance, if no one likes canned cranberries, you can remove it from the dinner.
Talk to your guests and ask them about the dishes that they dislike.

, Instead of having to wake up early to prepare your house for your guests, you could schedule your Thanksgiving at a later time. This will allow you to sleep in and reduce the stress that you'd typically have during the holiday. Push back dinner to a later time like 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. instead of having an early meal.


If you are changing the time of dinner, make sure you alert your guests well in advance.

, Check with your guests and try to get a sense of their schedule. If possible, consider moving Thanksgiving to the weekend. This will give you more time to prepare and will reduce the amount of stress on you. It can also allow you to concentrate on work or school instead of preparing for the holiday.


If you work a lot, being able to prepare on a day off is much better than having to prepare for Thanksgiving after you get home from work.

, Instead of cooking at home or inviting a large group of guests, you could go out to eat instead. If you want to stay somewhat traditional, aim for places that serve the typical Thanksgiving fare like turkey or mashed potatoes. If tradition doesn't concern you, then consider easier alternatives like Chinese take-out, pizza, or sushi.

Make it a potluck Thanksgiving.,
Keep your invitation list small.,
Have family help with the preparations.,
Invite the core group to dinner and the rest of the guests to dessert.",How to Simplify Your Thanksgiving Gathering2," Encouraging others to bring a special dish will help alleviate some of your Thanksgiving duties. Contact people on your guest list beforehand to determine who is cooking what. If two guests want to cook the same thing, ask one of them to bring something else. If a person claims that they can't cook, suggest that they bring the libations or purchase dessert from the store.


You can say something like, ""This year we are going to have a potluck Thanksgiving where everyone brings their own dish and we all share. What would you want to bring?""
If two people want to bring the same thing you can say, ""Brian is already making mashed potatoes. Can you think of something else to make?""

, Having many people attend Thanksgiving could add an extra level of complexity when trying to satisfy all of your guests. Invite people that are the most important to you to keep the guest list smaller. Think of close family and friends and eliminate those that may have their plans already, or that you feel impartial about.


A good sized guest list is 8-10 people, but if you want to keep it even simpler, you can reduce it to your immediate family.

, While designating tasks to other family and friends may not feel like a simple Thanksgiving, it will reduce the amount of work that you'll have to do. Create a list beforehand and talk to your guests about if they'd be interested in getting to your house earlier and helping prepare.


If you have younger children or nephews and nieces, you can have them do simple tasks like setting the table or stirring the gravy.
You can say something like, ""I'm trying to make Thanksgiving easier this year. Do you think you could help out with the preparations?""

, Restricting the entirety of your guest list to dessert will enable you to invite and spend time with everyone that you want, without the added stress of having to prepare a Thanksgiving meal for a large number of people. Go through your guest list and invite your closest family and friends to the main meal, then invite the rest of the guests for dessert. Make sure to allocate enough time between dinner and dessert so that people don't start showing up in the middle of dinner.


You can ask someone by saying something like, ""We are having a small Thanksgiving dinner, but I was wondering if you and your family wanted to come over for desert at 9 p.m.""

Purchase non-perishable food early.,
Make your dinner before Thanksgiving day.,
Use minimal decorations.",How to Simplify Your Thanksgiving Gathering3," Stock up well before Thanksgiving so that you don't have to do all of your shopping at once. Things like pumpkin pie filling or canned cranberry sauce are more readily available before November and can be purchased at most grocery stores. Things like plastic storage bags, aluminum foil, and sealable storage containers are also great things to pick up in advance., Preparing a course before Thanksgiving will reduce the amount of things you have to do. Things like mashed potatoes, stuffing, and desserts can be made a day or two before you serve them to your guests.Once you've finished making the food, make sure that you refrigerate it in a sealed container, so it stays fresh until Thanksgiving.


If you are making food well in advance of Thanksgiving, you should freeze it to keep it fresh. Things like cooked meat are only good for three to four days in the refrigerator.It may also help to tell other people in the house that the food was made specifically for Thanksgiving, so they don't accidentally eat it.
Other things that you can make in advance include cornbread, pies, and cranberry sauce., You don't need to have elaborate autumn decorations in your house to have a successful Thanksgiving. Instead of going overboard, consider using minimal decorations for maximum effect. A small, affordable arrangement of flowers can act as a dining room centerpiece.Don't go out of your way to break out the elaborate China either, use regular ceramic dishes and bowls to keep it simple.


Miniature pumpkins or gourds may also be a good alternative to elaborate decorations.

If only five people will be there, then you can skip the huge turkey and go for a smaller one. If you have yet to hear from people you've invited, buy a little extra.;
, Many families have a traditional casserole or pie of some sort that goes untouched every year. Or maybe your children have an aversion to yams. Take into account what people like and don't like, then skip the unpopular foods. This will save you both money and time.

, If your local grocery store has a sale on stuffing a few weeks before Thanksgiving, buy it! In the case of canned goods with a long shelf life, you might want to try buying them after Thanksgiving, when holiday food is on sale, to save for next year.

, A single store probably won't have the best prices in everything. If you get circulars in the mail, check them all to see who has the best prices on the groceries you need. If not, check online, or do your weekly shopping at different places to do some searching around.

, If you can get your hands on some coupons for beans, corn, or fresh bread, be sure to use them. If you don't have any, check online for printable ones.

, Sometimes generic foods taste as good, if not better, than brand name goods. If you want to be sure, it might be best to get a can of vegetables to try ahead of time and decide from there.

Choose to stay in.,
Visit a new place on NYE.,
Decline invites in which alcohol is the main focus.,
Prepare a response when offered alcohol.,
Plan to work on New Year’s Day.",How to Stay Sober on New Year's Eve1," If you’d much rather avoid drunken conversations and being the one to usher stumbling friends to safety, you could opt to spend the evening at home. However, being at home doesn’t mean you can’t participate in the excitement. There are tons of ways to plan a fun night with a group of friends who also choose to avoid alcohol.


Consider organizing a goal-setting or vision board party where you and a group of close pals set your intentions for the following year. Binge-watch some favorite TV shows or have a movie marathon. Snuggle up with your significant other by the fireplace. Coordinate a game night or poker night. The possibilities are endless!;
, Are you itching to trot the globe in the new year? Start early and tick off an interesting new location to bring in the new year. In a foreign locale, you won’t completely have your bearings about where everything is located, so you are less likely to have the urge to get intoxicated.


Book a hotel in a neighboring city or dust off your passport and fly to another country to celebrate., Wine tastings, cocktail parties and other alcohol-centered gatherings in bars may be fun, but it’s so much harder to stick to your vow in these settings. If a friend or coworker extends an invitation, politely decline.You might say, “I have other plans,” or “I don’t plan on drinking this NYE. Thanks for the invite, though.”

, Ease your own tension and prevent awkwardness by planning what you’ll say if offered a drink. A simple “No thanks, I have something,” could work if you already have a non-alcoholic beverage in hand. Raise your hand to indicate your fake booze and keep partying.


Even better: tell people in advance. Breaking the ice before you’re put in a tempting situation sends the message that you already have clear intentions of staying sober. That way if you’re asked, you can simply remind them, “Remember, I told you I’m staying sober this year!”, The temptation to imbibe lessens when you know you have to hit the time clock in the morning. If it’s possible for you to work on the first day of the new year, sign up. This gives you an automatic excuse to decline drinks—and duck out of celebrations early, if you’re so inclined."
"
Go to a meeting beforehand.,
Find a sober buddy.,
Leave immediately, if you feel compromised.,
Know how to seek help, if you do relapse.",How to Stay Sober on New Year's Eve2," If you regularly attend self-help groups with others who are recovering from problem-drinking, it might help to go to several meetings during the week prior to NYE. You can also attend a meeting on New Year’s Day to help ward off any triggers you might have experienced the night before. If you don’t usually attend meetings, or will be out of town, look up an Alcoholics Anonymous groups near you.Getting a healthy dose of recovery material and encouragement could help you fight urges that arise during end-of-the-year gatherings.
If you feel comfortable doing so, directly address the issues you have with New Year’s Eve in the meeting so that the group can support you.

, One of the most guaranteed ways to stay sober on New Year’s Eve is by bringing in reinforcements. Know of a friend who doesn’t drink or has had a successful and well-established recovery? Ask them to accompany you at the festivities, or at the very least, to call you and check in as specified times.”Hey, Paul, you have been such an inspiration during my recovery. Ten years of sobriety is such an accomplishment! If you’re free, would you like to join me at an event on New Year’s Eve? I could use some support.” More than likely, your acquaintance will be happy to assist you.

, If at any point during this celebratory evening you start to feel pressured or uncomfortable, make your exit. For this reason, it might be better to drive yourself or arrange another form of independent transportation so you don’t have to rely on someone else to be able to leave. It’s better to risk being slightly rude to friends and having to explain later than jeopardizing your recovery.Let’s say someone keeps bugging you about drinking, you learn that people are spiking others’ drinks, or any other compromising behavior is taking place. Get out right away.
You can tell the host “The environment is too risky for my sobriety, so I’m leaving,” or you can simply find the nearest exit. Better safe than sorry.

, If you mess up and have a drink, try not to panic. Beating yourself up can lead to you becoming depressed, and further complicate your recovery. Instead, contact your self-help group sponsor, sober buddy, or counselor for help.Keep in mind that this is when many people tend to avoid their support team. However, if they are doing their job right, then they will be supportive and not nasty to you.


Say, “Hi, Dr. Tracy, I went out on New Year’s Eve and got drunk. I’ve ruined my recovery! I need to come in as soon as possible.”
In addition to seeking professional guidance, it is also necessary to be honest with yourself to assess what happened. Did you have trouble resisting peer pressure? Did you hang out with bad influences? Answering these questions will help you prevent relapse next time.

Mix up a “mocktail.” Staying away from alcohol doesn’t mean you have to stick with a boring drink.,
Toast with sparkling grape juice.,
Bring along some soda.,
Indulge your sweet tooth.",How to Stay Sober on New Year's Eve3," There are a range of non-alcoholic cocktails that are just as fun, but don’t come with guilt or headaches the following morning. Try non-alcoholic beer, cider, eggnog, or have a serve mix up just about any cocktail without liquor.You can even research some fancy mocktails that will make you feel like you are a part of the party. Bring the ingredients with you so that you can mix them up yourself.

, Bottles of faux champagne are easy to find during this time of year for people who don’t drink alcohol. Pick up a bottle on the way to your gathering. That way, you won’t feel so left out during the champagne toast when the clock strikes twelve.

, If you’re not sure if the host will have any alcohol-free drinks handy, bring your own choice of beverage with you. Fancy fountain sodas or regular diet Coke both give you something to sip on while swaying anyone from asking, “Can I get you a drink?”, Most types of alcohol contain sugar, so you could reduce any cravings by eating something sweet. If the NYE party you’re attending doesn’t have any cakes or cookies, provide them to ensure they’re available. Satisfying your sweet tooth could help you ease any thoughts of reaching for a glass.Just be sure not to overdo it. It’s easy to trade one addiction for another. Enjoy sweets in moderation to minimize your risk of picking up a new habit.

Get your full eight hours.,
Rise and shine — and eat.,
Wash your hands.,
Know your family health history.,
Eat mindfully.,
Add variety to your diet.,
Volunteer.,
Maintain strong family and social networks.,
Take a time out.,
Drink more water to prevent constipation, dehydration and other related diseases.",How to Start the New Year Right," Just as a healthy diet and regular exercise are necessary and important for good health, so is sleep. Cutting back on snooze-time can lead to an out-of-control appetite (some studies show that people who sleep less are more likely to be overweight), a greater risk for coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. So try to get the recommended eight hours of sleep needed for good health, safety, and optimum performance.;
, Breakfast gets your body’s metabolism going again after a night of sleeping, and gives you the gradual and adequate energy you need to get through the morning. You don't have to eat snacks to supplement your energy needs and expenditure. It doesn’t have to be complicated too. Microwave instant oatmeal, topping it with skim milk or yogurt and berries; in minutes, you’ll enjoy filling fiber with a protein and vitamin boost. Hard-boiled eggs, whole-grain toast with almond butter or a fruit and yogurt smoothie are also quick, nutritious choices.

, From banishing cold and flu germs to preventing food borne illnesses, frequent hand-washing is one of the smartest preventive habits you can adopt. Wash your hands with warm water and soap before handling food, eating, or touching your face , and after using the bathroom or coming into contact with potentially contaminated objects such as doorknobs, toys and menus. Be sure to clean the entire surface of your palms and the tops of your hands, as well as under your nails. A thorough hand-washing should take about 20 seconds.

, Your family’s medical history can give you important information about your own health. Many diseases, such as heart disease, breast cancer, diabetes, and depression, can have a genetic component. The more you know about the health of your relatives, the better informed you’ll be about your own risk factors and how to manage them.

, One of the significant differences between people who successfully manage their weight and people who constantly struggle is mindful eating. Turn off the TV or computer, sit down at a table with your food on a plate, and focus on eating. Savor the smell and enjoy the taste. Put your fork down between bites, and take time to really enjoy your meal. Chances are you will eat less and feel more satisfied.

, Wild salmon and sardines are just a couple of the fish that provide heart-healthy fats such as omega-3, which lower your risk of cardiovascular disease and help preserve your cognitive function. Aim for two servings a week; more than that may add too much mercury to your system. On occasion, indulge in a glass of red wine (or any alcoholic beverage) or a bite of dark chocolate that contains at least 75% cocoa-both contain antioxidants that can benefit your heart. In addition, both may relax blood vessels, which reduces clotting somewhat and makes it easier for blood to get to the heart. And finally, try to eat 5-7 servings a day of fruits and vegetables, and minimize your intake of carbohydrates.

, In addition to helping others, volunteers themselves often benefit from “giving back” to the communities in which they live and work, and enjoy a rewarding sense of doing something good for someone else. As a volunteer, you gain valuable experience, learn new skills, make friends and meet others who share the same interests. At Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, volunteers also enjoy perks such as special events and wellness programs.

, Research has shown that people who have family and friends they can turn to for support and companionship may be healthier and less likely to experience depression than those who spend most of their time alone. Looking for new friends? Join a club, take a class or volunteer.

, At least once a day, close your eyes and focus on taking 10 deep, full breaths. Inhale through your nose, feel your diaphragm expand, and exhale through your mouth. Deep, focused breathing slows your heart rate, calms the body and, as a result, calms your mind and reduces stress. Mix in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity at least five days a week as well. Choose something you enjoy and will stick to. Recent studies found that brisk walking is just as good for your heart as jogging, or try biking or swimming. You needn’t do it all at once; two 15-minute workouts or three 10-minutes blocks work equally well.

, Whether you drink bottled, filtered or tap, water helps keep your cells hydrated, flushes out toxins, and prevents dehydration. Tea, juices and sports drinks count, too, but watch out for added sugar, artificial flavorings and caffeine, all of which can detract from the benefits.

Remember that “if it grows together, it goes together.” The idea behind this saying is that wines and foods tend to develop together as part of a regional cuisine.,
Give your guests options.,
Pair a pinot noir with your turkey and side dishes.,
Serve a riesling or merlot with your ham.,
Offer your guests a malbec if you are serving lamb.,
Try to serve a sweet white wine.",How to Serve Wine at Thanksgiving1," For example, white wines, which are typically made in warmer climes, tend to pair well with foods that grew in a similar climate. Try to look for wines from a similar climate as the food that you are serving for Thanksgiving.However, there is no right or wrong wine for any occasion. The best wine is one that you know that your guests will enjoy.;
, Because people’s tastes differ, you should consider offering your guests multiple types of wine. At the minimum, have a red and white wine option. You might want to offer a pinot noir and a white zinfandel since they pair well with many traditional Thanksgiving foods. You should also consider serving a dessert wine, such as a sweet riesling.


Depending on how many guests you are hosting, you should have a few bottles in reserve.

, A low-acid, high-tannin pinot with hints of berry may be a good complement to your turkey. This is especially true considering how often people pair turkey with cranberries. For a great pairing, look for a pinot that comes from the Pacific Northwest or the Great Lakes area.Be sure to serve pinot noir slightly chilled (50°F/10°C to 55°F/13°C)
Pinot noir can accompany most of your meat dishes.

, If you are serving ham for Thanksgiving, try to find a wine with some fruity tones that also has a hint of sweetness. A sweet riesling, a white zinfandel, or a merlot pair well with honey glazed hams. If you are serving smoked ham, you might want to consider a pinot noir or a zinfandel.Serve your riesling chilled (48°F/8°C) and your merlot slightly under room temperature (55°F/13°C to 60°F/15°C)

, Because lamb has a less pronounced flavor than other meats, it can be overwhelmed if paired with a full-flavored wine. Try to serve a wine that has a delicate flavor, such as a malbec or a syrah. You should also consider the sauce that you serve with your lamb and pair your wine accordingly.For a traditional Thanksgiving brown gravy, consider serving a bordeaux or a barbera.
Serve your stronger red wines between 60°F/15°C and 65°F/18°C

, Most chardonnays are too dry to pair well with the variety of flavors that your taste buds will experience on Thanksgiving. However, a white wine with a little sweetness, like a riesling or a gewurztraminer, can go with the main meal and any desserts. If you serve a white wine, try to find something that is sweet, high-acid or both."

Get some wine glasses.,
Set the table.,
Keep your red wine in a decanter.,
Use a wine preserver.",How to Serve Wine at Thanksgiving2," In order to get the best tasting experience from your wine, you will want to consider using glasses of a certain shape. For a white wine, use a glass with a smaller bowl that helps maintain a cool temperature and preserves the wine’s aromas. For a red wine, you will want a glass with a larger bowl that helps deliver the aroma and limits the burn of the alcohol in the wine.However, if you are not particular about how your wine tastes, you can serve it in any kind of cup you want.

, When you are setting the table for your Thanksgiving feast, you will want to be sure to place the wine glass to the top right of the dinner plate and next to the water glass. If you want to make sure that your guests get the correct glass for their wine, consider offering your guests wine when they arrive and then allow them to keep their wine glass for dinner. This sign of hospitality will keep you from doing any guess work.Avoid setting out more than two glasses. Too many drinks can overcrowd your dining area and lead to spills.

, The flavor of most red wines will improve significantly if allowed to sit in a decanter for 30 to 45 minutes. Simply pour the wine that you want to serve in a decanter and let it sit. Cheap red wines, in particular, will benefit from some decanting. In fact, most wines, with the exception of very old wines, will benefit from some decanting.You can also use an aerator that will decant your wine almost instantaneously.

, If you have any leftover wine after your Thanksgiving festivities, you should invest in a wine preserver. This will help preserve the wine’s flavor and aroma. Storing the wine in the fridge and keeping it out of direct sunlight will also help it last longer.If you have access to one, store your wine in a wine refrigerator.

Cut the foil.,
Remove the cork.,
Pour a standard wine serving.",How to Serve Wine at Thanksgiving3," For your Thanksgiving dinner, you can simply remove the foil or try to cut it in a way that enhances the visual appeal of the bottle. If you intend to keep the wine on the table, use foil cutters to cut the foil at the top of the lip. This is the method typically used when presenting wine to a group of people where it will be displayed.Sommeliers tend to cut at the bottom of the lip. This is a tradition that goes back to when the foil was made of lead and sommeliers wanted to keep the metal out of wine.

, There are many methods to opening a bottle of wine. You can use a sommelier knife, a shoe or even a hammer and nails. However, a corkscrew is the most common and the simplest means for opening a bottle and removing the cork. Simply screw the corkscrew into the cork and then pull it out.Try to place the corkscrew a little off center. This will prevent you from breaking the cork.

, A standard wine pour is about 5 to 6 ounces (150 to 180ml). If you want to a standard serving every time, measure 5 to 6 ounces of water into a glass, dump the water out, and then pour in wine to where the water was. However, for your Thanksgiving feast, feel free to pour your wine as liberally as you would like.Twist the bottle away from you to prevent any dripping.
There are usually five 5 to 6-ounce servings in a bottle.

Be clear and firm in your commitment, and do not waver!, People who write down their goals and resolutions are more likely to achieve them than people who don’t., Taking time to measure your progress (preferably in a chart or other visual tool) can go a long way towards spurring you on to success., Whenever possible, find an accountability partner or someone with the same goal, and support each other throughout the process. People who commit to exercise with a partner (or group) are far more likely to stick with their exercise programs than people who choose to go it alone."

Decide whether you want to an active or a reflective New Year's Eve.",How to Plan New Year's Eve for a Nature Lover1," You could either interact with nature or you could simply view it or reflect about it. The choice will affect the way in which you celebrate, as the interactive celebration will require that you go somewhere to be a part of nature.

Plan where to go.,
Consider whether you want to see nature in summer or winter.,
Decide whether you'd rather be on land or at sea.,
Choose the place you'll stay in for the night.,
Plan things to do.,
Prepare for your New Year's Eve adventure.",How to Plan New Year's Eve for a Nature Lover2," This could be as simple as traveling to a cabin in the woods or pitching a tent by the beach, depending on where you live in the world. If you want to get away from the weather in your usual locale, you may need to book a flight to a different part of the country or even to go overseas. If you've left it till the last minute, your own backyard or a local park might be just the place to celebrate in.

, Again, this may depend on where you live and how far your budget stretches but if you're celebrating in winter and want a summery New Year's Eve, consider flying to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa or South America, where you'll find plenty of different nature destinations to soak up the sun and see the New Year in. On the other hand, if you love winter, perhaps all you need to do is book a cabin in the local mountains and drive up there for a few days.

, What wildlife and scenery do you wish to see? Marine wildlife is amazing but can be difficult to perceive if you're in a winter climate, while you'll be able to see plenty of ocean animals if you're in the southern hemisphere for New Year's Eve and charter a vessel with a nature guide. If you're happier on land, there are many options including nature parks, safari parks, the woods or a forest, savannah or grasslands, mountains or coast, etc.

, Decide whether to stay the night among nature or indoors overlooking nature. Your choices here can range from sleeping in a nice hostel, hotel, cabin, tent or under the stars. Consider the temperature and your comfort when selecting suitable accommodation––while a tent in the campgrounds of anywhere in New Zealand for New Year's Eve may be just perfect, you'll probably prefer the warmth of a cabin with a roaring log fire in the Adirondacks or Banff for New Year's Eve.


One problem you may experience is that popular places tend to be booked out well in advance, so thinking ahead a long way is required for such destinations.

, As midnight approaches you may decide to be on anything from a ship, car, horse drawn sleigh, train, or just on foot.


For those celebrating New Year's Eve in the winter: Your choices as midnight approaches can include skating or playing some hockey on a pond or lake, skiing under lights or snowboarding on a well-lit slope. If you wish to spend the last evening of the year with a sedentary activity in a northern location and sleep indoors, you may wish to view the northern lights, take a scenic drive, or enjoy a sleigh ride.
For those celebrating New Year's Eve in the summer: You could go rock climbing, mountain biking, hiking, horse riding, camping and even climb a mountain. An active trip to a warmer climate involving water could include windsurfing, rafting, scuba diving, snorkeling, canoeing, sailing and parasailing.

, If you are planning to stay outdoors by camping, your list will be quite different then if you plan to spend the night in a hotel.


For a hotel or cabin: Bring your outdoor clothing, a bottle of champagne to share outdoors, any gear needed for outdoor activities and some things to do to pass the time. Bring some bedding if required and have the food you'd like to eat for the time spent at the place.
For camping: Your tent and bedding (unless supplied). At minimum, you will need your sleeping bag, and an air mattress or cot might be helpful. Some items that would be helpful for cooking include matches or a lighter, pots or pans, utensils, plates and bowls, a thermos, dish rags and towels, and dish soap. You will also need to bring proper clothing for the environment and personal items that allow you to clean up.

Decorate with a nature theme.,
Wear clothing in colors that represent nature.,
Make food that represents nature.,
Include games with a nature theme.,
Give your guests a living gift to remind them of nature.",How to Plan New Year's Eve for a Nature Lover3," Use natural items to make your home look like you brought nature indoors. Some suggestions include:


Pin up posters of wilderness scenes and wild animals around the party room.
Use floral, leaf and other nature-based arrangements to bring the outdoors inside. This could include wreaths, centerpieces, vases or baskets of flowers, bowls of fruit, live plants and such other things.
Find paper napkins, plates and other items with nature theme decorations on them, such as leaves, flowers and animals.
Use items such as stuffed animals, fur fabric, leaf shaped lights, etc. to add to the nature theme. Pebbles, twigs, leaves and other natural items can be used to decorate tables, sideboards, window sills, etc.
Use wood pieces for turning into items such as name tags around glasses, table place names, hot dish holders, etc.

, This could include using natural tones such as browns, greens, blues, yellows and oranges. Aim for organic cottons, bamboo and other very natural fabrics where possible. You might like to ask people to dress up in their own choice of what represents nature to them; award a prize for the best costumes and ideas.


Another idea is to ask guests to wear the clothes of their favorite activity that they do in nature; this might include snowboard or ski gear, wetsuits, bathing gear, mountain climbing gear, etc. and could be quite a fun way to get conversations started.

, This could include food in the shape of wild animals, trees, flowers and the like. You could also use freshly caught and harvested food, as well as making the entire feast from locally sourced produce. Explain to the guests where the food came from and why you feel that it matters that people enjoy more locally grown food and how this helps your local nature.

, You could find board games or video games with nature themes such as collecting animals for a wildlife park, conserving a wilderness area, etc. Camp style games are a good resource to draw on. And games that use natural items such as stone and wood might be another useful addition to the evening's entertainment.


As well as games, you could set up a nature craft table for the kids to make crafts at. Lots of ideas for nature themed crafts can be found here.

, At the end of the evening, celebrate both renewal and nature with a gift that represents both, such as a packet of seeds to grow, a living plant or membership to a nature society.

Alter your resolution to be more realistic and specific.,
Clarify the goals of your resolution.,
Focus on small successes.",How to Revive Your Abandoned New Year's Resolution1," The majority of broken resolutions come about because an individual set a goal for themselves that was overly ambitious, or simply unrealistic. You can revive the resolution but in more moderate, manageable terms—this will allow you to note the progress you’re making and feel good about yourself, rather than making you feel as though you’re up against impossible odds.For example, if you resolved to lose weight—one of the most common New Year's resolutions—modify the amount you want to lose. If you resolved to lose 20 pounds, cut that number in half.
As another example, if you resolved to exercise more, you don’t have to hold yourself to hitting the gym every day. Set a minimal goal at first—going to the gym once a week—and then increase your gym attendance over the course of the year.;
, Vague resolutions such as “I want to be a better person,” “I want to find a better job,” or “I want to get in shape this year” are practically bound to fail, as the terms they use are vague and difficult to think about concretely. If your resolution had been vague, re-word it using more specific language. This will give you a definite goal to pursue, and also let you measure progress as you work on the resolution.For example, the resolutions listed above could be clarified to say:


“I want to tell fewer lies to my supervisor and coworkers.”
“I want to quit my current job by March and send out 6 applications by April.”
“I want to visit a gym twice weekly and lose 5 pounds this year.”

, New Year’s resolutions often seem like overwhelming, monumental tasks that will be impossible to complete. This is often the reason why many people fail to complete their resolution. To improve your chances of success, focus on small goals throughout the year, rather than one large goal for the end of the New Year. You can motivate yourself to complete your resolution by completing series of small steps and tracking this progress.For example, if you’ve resolved to stop smoking during the New Year, set yourself small, manageable goals. Rather than expecting to stop cold-turkey by March, be realistic: if you start the year smoking 1 pack a day, cut back to ½ a pack by May, ¼ of a pack by October, and kick the habit by January.

"
"
Find a community that will support you fulfilling your resolution.,
Motivate yourself with optimistic thinking.,
Write down your reasons for pursuing the resolution.",How to Revive Your Abandoned New Year's Resolution2," It can be difficult to stick to a New Year’s resolution, especially if the resolution requires physical activity or daily participation. You’ll be more motivated to work on your resolution if you have a community or support group around you. By making your resolution socially known, you’ll provide yourself with a support group and individuals who can hold you accountable to pursuing your resolution.For example, if you’ve resolved to drink less alcohol in the New Year, tell a few friends or family members about your decision. Ask them to check in with you weekly, to make sure you haven’t backslid.
Similarly, if you’ve resolved to take up an artistic practice in the New Year (painting, pottery, etc.), join a class rather than working in solitude.

, It can be easy to focus on the difficult parts of your resolution, or to feel like you’re not making much progress on the goal, and give up the resolution entirely. In order to avoid this pitfall, maintain an optimistic mindset and focus on the success that you have achieved. To facilitate this, you can break your resolution down into small sections and focus on completing one at a time.For example, if resolve to learn to play a musical instrument during the course of a year, don’t be self-critical if you haven’t mastered it by December. Rather, focus on the small steps of progress that you’ve made and allow these accomplishments to motivate further practice and improvement.

, As the months tick by and your initial motivation to accomplish your resolution fades, you’ll need a way to remind yourself why your resolution matters. An excellent way to do this is to write down a list of half a dozen reasons for pursuing your New Year’s resolution. If you do this early in the year—say, by the middle of March—you can refer back to your list throughout the summer and fall to keep motivated and maintain progress towards your resolution.For example, if you resolved to stop smoking within a year, you can make a list of reasons to quit including: “To preserve my health,” “To increase my lifespan,” and “To not harm those around me.”

Don’t be distracted by a “false first step”.,
Choose a resolution that you can start working on immediately.,
Don’t make resolutions out of guilt or anger.",How to Revive Your Abandoned New Year's Resolution3," A false first step is any sign of progress that doesn’t have a genuine impact on achieving your New Year's resolution. These distractions can be material or tangible. Often the pleasure of purchasing something which may help you pursue your resolution can be a distraction from being genuinely productive. Focus on meeting your resolution, and don’t be distracted by false progress.For example, if you’re planning to improve your fitness in the New Year, you can begin losing weight by jogging through your neighborhood or focusing on simple exercises like sit-ups and pushups.
Don’t consider buying a Fit Bit, a heart rate monitor, or an expensive gym membership until after a few weeks of jogging.

, Individuals often fail to follow through on their resolutions because they don’t anticipate the many steps that must be completed to reach a complex goal. Avoid this mistake by choosing a resolution that you can begin making progress on within the coming week, or by breaking your resolution down into a series of smaller steps.For example, if you resolved to learn to speak fluently in a foreign language by the end of the new calendar year, you will find progress hard to track and soon become discouraged.
Modify your resolution so that you can begin making progress: resolve “I will learn one new word a day for a month,” “I will spend every Saturday afternoon studying French,” “I will join a French-language study group,” or some combination of these achievable resolutions.

, Many of us make New Year’s resolutions out of a sense of frustration or guilt at the end of the old year. While this can be a powerful reactionary and motivating force in the short term, in the long term guilt will fade away. Negative emotions are not good motivators, and resolutions based on guilt typically leave you feeling worse about yourself.For example, if you are ashamed or annoyed with yourself for having gained a few pounds during the winter months, you may be inclined to guiltily resolve to lose 15 pounds in the New Year.
However, if you’re only motivated by that guilt, you’ll soon become discouraged with a lack of progress and give up on the resolution.

Saying grace doesn't mean, ""GRACE!!!"" Saying grace means giving thanks to the Lord for everything you have.;
, If you've eaten at least 3 pounds on past Thanksgivings, try to eat less than 2 lbs, but more than 1/2 pound. It is healthier that way.

, If one drumstick (turkey leg) is 150 calories, eat two. That is 300 calories. Then think about the pumpkin pie, if 1 slice is 80 calories, eat two. 300 plus 160 is 460. If one small squirt of whipped cream is 20 calories, put one medium-sized squirt it on top of your pumpkin pie. That one meal is 500 calories (because of the medium-sized squirt of whipped cream).

, Maybe a serving of fruit, cut vegetables, or crackers will hold you for a little while into the feast.

, This will decrease the chance of you eating half the turkey and six slices of pumpkin pie. Talking burns the calories you're taking in. Remember, calories are burnt by every single little movement.

Plan your menu.,
Select your recipes.,
Draft your preparation schedule.,
Make some advance preparation for the table.,
Make a new tradition for your Thanksgiving.",How to Plan a Traditional Thanksgiving Occasion," Traditionalists prefer to see the same menu items every year. If you are traditional, then you should have a good idea about what to include on the menu--whatever was on the menu last year. You may want to experiment, and that's O.K. too. Most people include some traditional items and try a new twist on one or two things every year. The basic framework includes: - appetizers, hors d'oeuvres or soup course; -bread, biscuits, rolls, or cornbread; -potatoes or rice; -a green vegetable (for example broccoli or green bean casserole); -winter squash and/or sweet potatoes; -stuffing or dressing; -the big bird; -gravy and cranberry sauce or relish; and -pie for dessert.;
, Ask your parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents for traditional recipes. You can get new ideas from looking at various cooking websites, watching cooking shows, and checking other ideas in wikiHow for Thanksgiving cooking. If you want to try new things, look for a central theme, like Native American foods, early American cooking, or focusing on crops that originated in the New World. Talk to your older relatives to find out what foods they usually had or brought to America with them. Make sure to select only a couple of new things, and try them out before T-day so that you are certain that they should be included in your menu. Don't try to do too many new things or too many complicated things at once, though. Preparing a big meal, even a simple one, is a challenge in itself. It's easy to get in over your head if you don't stick with a basic menu of things that you can easily prepare. Don't think that you can't use prepared foods or ingredients either. For example, cornbread mix is fine either by itself or to make cornbread dressing, and bakery items are just fine, too. Many successful cooks get by with a little homemade and a little help. Also, make sure that you have added something to the menu for any vegans, vegetarians, or people with food allergies or sensitivities. If you are clueless, you may want to ask them for a recipe or to bring a dish. You may want to make the whole meal a potluck, assigning types of food to different people -- after all, that's what happened on the first Thanksgiving.

, If you are making a meal for many guests, you will want to prepare what you can in advance and spread out the phases of preparation over several days. After you have prepared your menu and selected your recipes, you should have some idea about what can be prepared in advance. Also, check with family nearby to see if they would like to help prepare a particular dish. If you prepare it together, you can start a new family tradition or learn about your heritage, or if not, at least you have some help getting the meal ready. You can enlist help by reminding a relative or friend how much everyone enjoyed their special dish last year before asking them to make it again. Think about things that can be prepared a day or two ahead, too, like pie fillings, cranberry sauce, and the like. Note that Thanksgiving seems to be a time when there is never enough oven space available at the last minute. Take some of the pressure off by making the sweet potatoes or stuffing in a slow cooker. Lots of good slow cooker recipes are available on the Internet, or take your own recipe and adjust it according to manufacturer's directions or other information you can get on some cooking sites. Slow cookers are also great for keeping gravy, mulled cider, or other dishes warm.

, Check to see if you have enough flatware, plates, serving ware, and a carving knife and fork (and a gravy boat, platters, etc.). If not, ask some of the people who are coming if they can bring anything. Do you have enough chairs? Do you need to borrow card tables? It's best to assign particular items so that you know in advance what you will have. Decide who is best suited to carve the turkey or ham, if you are serving it. Some families carve at the table, some take care of it in the kitchen -- do what suits you best. Do you like a festive table? When people ask what to bring, you may want to suggest that they have their little ones prepare seasonal centerpieces, collect leaves, make handprint turkey drawings, or bring some other centerpiece. If your family likes a particular beverage, like wine or cider, that is something else that people who offer to bring something might add to the meal.

, You could: -go around the table saying what you're thankful for; -start up a soccer or touch football game before dessert; -take a walk around the neighborhood or in the woods; -look at old family pictures or slides and reminisce; or -some other activity that brings people together and makes happy memories.

Choose a low-temperature method to prepare your turkey.,
Use convenience food items for your side dishes to cut down on stress.,
Delegate tasks.",How to Make Thanksgiving a Low Stress Holiday1," You can roast your turkey at no more than 250 °F (121 °C). It will take approximately 6-8 hours for a 30-pound bird. Season your bird and prepare it for roasting as usual. Use a meat thermometer and stick it into the thickest part of the thigh of the turkey, avoiding touching the bone. Begin basting your turkey after 4 hours, every 30-45 minutes. Brush on a mixture of seasonings, oil and honey 30 minutes to an hour before it is supposed to be served and turn up the heat for the last half hour to 350 °F (177 °C). Keep an eye on the browning level of your bird during that time so that the sugar in the honey doesn't turn black.;
, Use store-bought stuffing mixes and cranberry sauce to cut down on distracting side dishes. Buy frozen pie instead of making your own. If you enjoy candied yams, make them ahead of time and keep them covered in the refrigerator for a day or two. You could also make them a week or two ahead and freeze the finished yams.

, Speak to family members ahead of time to make sure they know their part in preparing for the Thanksgiving meal. One could be in charge of basting and making the stuffing, one for gravy/cranberry sauce etc., one or two for setting the table, one to help carve the bird or take care of desserts. Don't assume that as the host or hostess, you have to single-handedly prepare everything for a party of 10 or 20.

Avoid overnight house guests.,
Share responsibilities regarding other meals.",How to Make Thanksgiving a Low Stress Holiday2," While it is often considered traditional to have ""the whole family"" together, having your relatives stay in your home overnight is a stressful endeavour. You are then responsible for preparing multiple meals for large groups, entertaining them, and give up a large part of your privacy all at once. You and your guests might not end up well-rested, which can lead to uncomfortable grouchiness. Consider booking a sufficient amount of hotel or motel rooms for your relatives and guests well ahead of time to keep everything as affordable as possible. They will still be spending a large amount of time at your house, so you have a merry time, but this will give you time to rest and restore yourself in the evening, at least.

, Once again, speak to your guests ahead of time so that you are not slaving away in the kitchen for at least 2 breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. Split up tasks amongst your guests, too, especially if they are family members. Ask them to run to the store and restock beverages and snacks, for example. Consider going out to eat to a pancake restaurant for breakfast instead of getting up at 5 a.m. to make 50 pancakes at home.

Try to set boundaries ahead of time.,
Split them up.,
Accept that there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" reunion.",How to Make Thanksgiving a Low Stress Holiday3," If you know one of your relatives will go on a long rant about another's weight, choice of partner, or parenting decisions, speak to them ahead of time and ask them in a polite, but firm way to refrain from staging an ""intervention"" over a dinner you are working hard to prepare. If necessary, let them know that you will not go to all this trouble so that they can pick on someone they only see once a year.

, If you know for a fact that there is no talking to a certain guest, organize after-dinner entertainment that will split up your group for a little while so that everyone can take a deep breath. For example, offer a walk to a few of your guests who get along with each other, while suggesting watching family videos or playing games at your house to others.

, While many people expect everyone to ""get along for once"", chances are, it will not go smoothly. Don't plaster a frozen smile on your face and ignore family members who are actively ruining the experience for others. Take them aside (maybe in the kitchen, maybe while getting groceries out of the car or beverages from the porch) and ask them to change their behaviour. If they blame it on someone else, reassure them that you will talk to that person, as well.

Cut the booties for the drumsticks.,
Put it all together.,
Put it on a platter.,
Add colorful designs.,
Fill it with “stuffing.” For an unexpected tasty twist, ditch the newspaper and fill your turkey with popcorn, candy or other easy-to-eat finger foods instead.,
Put your paper bag turkey on display.",How to Make a Paper Bag Turkey," For this project, you’ll need only need a handful of basic items—3 brown paper bags (1 large paper grocery bag and 2 smaller standard paper bags), 1 sheet of white 8 ½” x 11” typing paper, a few sheets of newspaper, a pair of scissors and a hot glue gun or some craft glue. Any additional materials will be up to you, depending on how elaborate you want the presentation of your finished turkey to be.Your turkey will be made of just three easy pieces: one big bag for the body, and the two smaller bags to serve as the “drumsticks.”
Making a paper bag turkey only takes a few minutes from start to finish, leaving you with plenty of time in your day to finish playing, decorating or tackling other crafting projects.;
, Take the large paper bag and fill it ¾ full with crumpled newspaper. This will help fill out the body, giving it a plump appearance and preventing it from collapsing once its ready to be displayed. After the bag has been stuffed, fold the corners down diagonally and glue them in place. Tuck the folded tab down one more time and glue it to the underside of the turkey.Shape the body of the turkey by hand until it’s smooth and round. Be sure to work out any square edges of creases from the original bag.
Be careful not to tear the bag while sealing or shaping it.

, Grab the two smaller paper bags—you’ll be using these to craft the “drumsticks” of the turkey. Make one hand into a fist and stick it into each bag, molding the opening of the bag around your wrist. This will give the bag its recognizable drumstick shape. Remove your hand from the bag and fill the rounded end with newspaper. Twist the opening of each bag shut and secure it with a dab of glue.Like the body of the turkey, the drumsticks will need to be filled in order to hold their shape.

, Your drumsticks aren’t complete until they’re dressed with a pair of frilly white booties, like a traditional Thanksgiving turkey. Cut your sheet of typing paper in half lengthwise, then fold each piece in half, again lengthwise. Use your scissors to make a series of cuts in the open edge of the paper to create a neat fringe.Try to make your cuts about ¼ inch apart.
Your cuts only need to be about half the width of the paper.

, Wrap a paper bootie around the end of each drumstick and secure them with glue. Then, place the drumsticks on either side of the sealed end of the turkey and glue them down. That’s it! The result is a quirky, lifelike baked bird that you might just mistake for the real thing.Attach the drumsticks to the tapered sides of the body where you folded down the edges of the big bag. This will give the turkey a more realistic look.
The different parts of the turkey will have a little weight to them once they’ve been filled. Use enough glue to make sure that everything holds.

, Arrange your paper bag turkey on a serving platter over a bed of parsley or tissue paper garnish. Surround the turkey with fallen leaves for a splash of vibrant color. With the right details, you’ll have a mouthwatering craft turkey worthy of a fantasy feast to show off to your friends and family.If you don't have a real serving platter lying around, make your own out of cardboard, construction paper and colored markers.
Make sure to let everyone, especially small children, know that your paper turkey is not for eating.

, Before you fill the paper bags, decorate the outsides for a more artistic, funky finish. Use crayons, markers, washable paint, stickers or glitter and customize your turkey with polka dots, swirls or dazzling patterns using your favorite colors. Grab a friend, sibling, parent or child to decorate your turkey with, then compare and display them together when you’re done.If you’re using paint or a felt-tip marker that might saturate the paper bags, allow them to dry before stuffing or shaping them.
When making paper turkeys with your kids or students, have them write down one thing they’re thankful for somewhere on the big bag.

, You can then have someone “carve” the turkey by cutting a flap in the top and have something to snack on until the main course is served. This imaginative serving style is sure to be a hit at holiday parties!Popcorn makes a simple stuffing because it’s light and takes up a lot of space, but you could use just about any snack food, like chips, pretzels or chocolates, to fill your turkey.
Try filling the drumsticks separately with caramel corn to make “dark meat.”, In addition to being a fun and easy project to do with your friends or loved ones, your paper turkey will make a unique arrangement for the coffee table, arts and crafts desk or kitchen counter. It will look especially good surrounded by other festive Fall decorations. Best of all, you can store the playful papercraft away or simply make a new one the next time the holiday season rolls around.A paper bag turkey will fit nicely with other homemade holiday decorations, such as hand turkey cutouts, popsicle stick snowflakes and construction paper pumpkins.

Select a plain colored tablecloth.,
Choose a color theme.,
Find a Cornucopia basket.,
Get crafty!,
Use nature for inspiration.,
Set the rest of the table as you would always for a dinner party.",How to Make a Beautiful and Easy Thanksgiving Dinner Table," White is an excellent color as it will set off anything you choose to add to the table but the choice is yours. Avoid patterns or designs, as these overwhelm the table too quickly.;
, Usual colors reflect fall - oranges, yellows, golds, reds and browns. Orange is also a reflection of pumpkins, squash and other signs of harvest bounty. Buy serviettes (napkins) that reflect the chosen theme - there are also various fall designs pre-printed on serviettes that might be suitable for your theme.

, This can be placed on the table to represent the bounty of harvest. You can leave it empty, or fill it with fruits such as red apples and yellow pears.

, Make fall colored paper items to provide color to the table:



Leaves - Choose a variety of paper that reflects realistic leaf colors and fits your chosen color theme, such as reds and oranges. Cut the papers into simple leaf designs (draw a template on light card that you can follow with the scissors or craft cutter). Make as many paper leaves as you feel you have time for. You might wish to turn some into arrangements and use some loose, so keep this in mind when making them.
Make small bouquet arrangements with some of the leaves. Place these around the base of a glass candle holder and insert an orange/gold etc. candle in the top of the holder.
Strew a few of the single leaves around the table in an artistic fashion. Ensure that color mixes are matching and in theme.



Napkin rings and tags - Use additional pieces of paper to make napkin rings and name tags.
Cut thin strips of paper and adjust these strips to fit around your folded cloth napkins. Glue or tape in place. Vary the colors if you have a good eye for matching designs.
Make name tags from the same colors of paper. Use a nice matching color of dark mustard type paper to stamp the letters on, or save time and use a Gel pen or similar to simply write the names.



Placemats - Place strips of colored paper diagonally overlapping each other to make diamonds that fit the rectangular shape of a placemat. You can also try round shapes if preferred, or be really daring and try shapes such as pumpkins, turkeys or Cornucopias. Glue in place.

, Adding natural elements to the table underlines the harvest theme.


Purchase miniature squash to decorate the table. These come already packaged with their own incredible charm and colors, so there really is no need to do anything else with them. Look for some that still have wispy tendrils, as these add a delicate finishing touch.
If you have access to clean fall leaves, you might like to add these to the table, or even create a display using leaves, pine cones and twigs.
Use fruit, such as apples and pears, in small displays.
Add a display of fresh flowers in hues of yellow, oranges or muted reds.
Use nuts with the shells off. Either place them strategically loose on the table, or add to a bowl, the Cornucopia basket or some other arrangement. If you have a small toy squirrel, place it next to the pecan nuts.

, Use your best dinnerware and flatware and if you haven't purchased specially themed Thanksgiving serviettes, use plain-colored cloth ones that match the theme. Add fine quality glassware and the set the name tag in place.

Bring the dishes out for everyone to admire.",How to Host a Thanksgiving Dinner," This means inviting your guests at least a month in advance. Call and find out who will be attending and if they plan on bringing any guests. Make sure to find out if your family or friends are bringing their kids. Knowing how many people are coming is really important. It would be horrible if the big day came and you only had enough food to feed half your guests. Family gatherings are generally a little tense--a shortage of food might invoke all out warfare.


If you want to get a little fancy, send invitations out to your guests. You can buy invitations at the store, or you can make your own. Your guests will be impressed that you took the time to do so (and will get even more excited about your dinner.);
, While we all know Thanksgiving is about giving thanks for everything we have, we also all know that the great food may occasionally overshadow the original intention. After all, who doesn't love friends and family gathered around some really fantastically mouth-watering creations? While most families put their own flourishes on traditional dishes, or even add non-traditional dishes, here is a list of some recipes to get you started:



Learn how to properly roast a turkey. For weeks now, you’ve probably been bombarded with images of golden birds sitting on beautiful tables. Well now you too can create your own golden bird.

What would a turkey be without stuffing? Check out this link to make some delicious bread stuffing.

Another T-Day staple is mashed potatoes. And while you’re at it, why not check out how to make some killer gravy?


Add a splash of red to your plate with cranberry sauce. Who knows, maybe you’ll even get a little crazy and take a bite of cranberry, turkey, stuffing, and potato all at the same time! (Hint: It’s delicious.)
And lets not forget dessert. Go for the gold medal and make a selection of pumpkin pie, apple pie, and pecan pie.


, Just because you are playing host this year doesn't mean you have to slave away over a turkey, 12 side dishes and five pies. Plan out what you think you can handle (say, the turkey, three side dishes, and a pie) and then ask your guests to bring other items (particularly, sides, desserts, and, of course, bottles of wine.) Ask each family member/friend to pick the dish they will be bringing and tell you at least a week before Thanksgiving (so you can make the extra items people won’t be bringing.)If you are planning on doing a potluck-style Thanksgiving, you may consider creating a spreadsheet (or at the very least a list) for yourself so that you can keep organized about who is bringing what.

, This step is not limited to the ingredients for you dishes--it also means getting a new, fall-themed tablecloth, picking up an extra set of cutlery, or just buying decorations you think might be nice around the house.



Tips for food shopping: Go through every recipe you are going to use and write down the items you don’t already have (or at least think you don’t.) Then, go through your cupboards and make sure you actually don't have that packet or all spice or that one yellow onion. You may be surprised by what you find when you dig deep. You should also keep in mind that getting perishable goods like apples (for that awesome pie you're going to make) are best bought the day before Thanksgiving.

Tips for supply shopping: Make a list of everyone who will be in attendance. Go through all of your china and cutlery and make sure everyone will have: a dinner plate, a dessert plate, a bowl, a fork, a knife, a spoon, and a glass. You may also want to check up on the number of your wine or champagne glasses. If you find you're short on some items, go pick up what you’re missing from your local home furnishing store.

, While you don’t have to do this a month in advance, you also shouldn't wait until the day before the dinner (because there are more important things...like baking pies…to be done the day before Thanksgiving.) While you don’t need to get too crazy with the decorations, should cute touches here and there won’t hurt. Here are some ideas:


Decorate your front door. Buy some decorative squash and place them outside your door or arranged in a basket nearby. (This is also a good way to use that pumpkin you never got around to carving.) Hang dried corn on your door (they come in amazing crimsons, maroons, oranges, and golds.)
Decorate the dinner table. While the food you will masterfully create may be decoration enough, you can also give your table some extra flair. Buy a cute fall-colored tablecloth. Put some candlestick holders on the table, complete with beautiful orange candlesticks.
Put little touches of fall around your house. Consider placing a bowl of fall-colored M&M’s on the coffee table, or fall-colored candles in strategic places around the house.

, This is particularly important if you are planning on baking pie(s). This is also a good time to make sure you have all the supplies and ingredients you will need--turkeys and pumpkin pie filling will be hard to find once the holiday arrives!


If you decide to cook everything the day of, make a plan as to what will go in the oven when. Most of the traditional Thanksgiving dishes get baked in the oven, so you will need to plan a coordinated attack. Find out which recipes take longer to cook and put them in first.

, While your guests won't be arriving until the next day, it is still extremely helpful to set your table the day before. Make your dining table as long as possible (time to break out that additional piece) or bring in an extra table if you simply can’t fit everyone at one table. Bring in all the chairs and place all the plates, napkins, cutlery, etc. on the table, spacing each setting out so that the guests won’t be bumping elbows every time they go to lift a delicious bite to their lips.


If you happen to know which of your guests are right handed vs. left handed, keep that in mind when setting the table. Placing a rightie next to a leftie will result in two guests smacking their elbows together all dinner long.

, While this is not necessary, having flowers in the house is always a nice touch. Its important to buy them the day before your dinner because if you buy them before then, they might wilt. Pick out bouquets that are fall-themed for an extra lovely touch.

, No one likes to be invited to a messy house, so tidy up the day before and make sure everything you won't need for the dinner is stored away. If you are short on time and need help with cleaning, get a family member or hire a cleaning service to assist.

, Turkeys generally take three to four hours to cook so plan accordingly. While your turkey is cooking, finish making the rest of your side dishes and desserts. If your guests are arriving at 4 pm, put the turkey in around 12:30 or 1 pm. That way, when your guests arrive the house will be filled with the delicious smells of roasting turkey and your turkey will be essentially done.When your turkey is done, you will have to carve it. Learn how to do that here.


, This means putting out any last minute place settings, making sure there is enough beer and wine to go around, etc. One important thing to check is that you have enough serving dishes (if you don’t plan on serving your items directly out of the dish they were cooked in.) Ceramic pots with lids are a great way to store things like mashed potatoes and stuffing, while keeping them hot at the same time.

, If possible, get a friend or family member to arrive early with appetizers (think light fare like cheese and crackers, olives, some nuts, etc.) Feeding your guests appetizers and providing them with drinks will promote mingling in the living room and will allow you an extra hour or so to finish up your last dishes., Ask everyone to take a seat or set it up so that all of the dishes are in a line and each person can serve him or herself. Enjoy the meal!

Know that turkey is a good food for dogs.,
Know what vegetables are best for dogs.,
Try giving your dog some bread.,
Know that your dog can have apples or pumpkin.,
Try cranberry sauce in small amounts.,
Beware of unsafe foods.,
Use moderation.,
Know that your dog has unique dietary needs.",How to Know Which Thanksgiving Leftovers to Feed a Dog," Canines are naturally carnivores, for the most part, and some well-cooked meat will be much appreciated by your dog. However, there are a couple precautions you need to take:


Make sure there are no bones in the turkey. A human will take the time to remove a bone from the meat they're eating, but a dog will ignore it. This could cause health complications for your dog if the bone is large or sharp.
Cut the meat into small pieces. Large slices of turkey will be difficult for your dog to eat. Smaller pieces will make it easier for him to eat, and it'll slow him down a little so he won't scarf it down in seconds.;
, Vegetables are a healthy addition to a dog's diet, and most are happy for a change of pace. Again, make sure you cut the vegetable into small pieces. Good vegetables for dogs include:


Green beans
Lettuce
Carrots
Corn (but not on the cob)
Celery
Mashed potatoes (only if they're plain)

, Tear bread into small pieces for your dog. Raw-dough is no good for dogs, though.

, If you have a bit of pumpkin or some apple slices left from making Thanksgiving pies, it's okay to pass them to the dog. The pie itself might not be a good idea.

, Cranberry sauce is fine for dogs, with one caveat-- it's high in sugar. Use caution if you want to introduce your dog to a sugary food like this.

, There are a number of foods that should never be given to a dog. If you have any of these on hand, keep them far away from your dog:


Grapes and raisins
Onions, garlic, scallions, and leeks
Milk and dairy products
Spices (and anything that might contain them)
Alcohol
Fatty foods
Salty foods
Anything raw

, There are plenty of foods that your dog can eat, but don't give them to her all at once, especially if she isn't used to human foods. Give your dog a small amount of one, two, even three dishes approved above.

, Just like humans, dogs can have allergies and sensitive stomachs. Your dog might be fine with a food that makes your neighbor's dog violently ill. Again, use moderation when introducing your dog to new foods.

Accept as much help as your guests are willing to offer.,
Make the main dish yourself.,
Ask each guest to contribute one side dish.,
Do as much as possible the day before.,
Allow guests to serve and seat themselves.,
Keep track of dishes and their temperatures.,
Have extra supplies on hand.",How to Host a Thanksgiving Potluck," This will allow you to prepare place settings and seating for all of your guests. A full head count will also allow you to calculate how large of a turkey (or other main dish) you’ll need to buy, and to approximate the amount of sides, drinks, and desserts you’ll need.Let your guests know that, if they plan to bring a “plus one” or to change the number of attendees in their party, they should let you know as soon as possible.
If guests respond with a “maybe,” count that as a “yes”—it’s better to have leftover food than to run out of food mid-potluck.;
, As the potluck host, you’ll have your hands full with preparing your house, cleaning dishes and furniture, and preparing whatever food you choose to provide. In order to be overwhelmed by responsibilities, don’t hesitate to delegate tasks to your guests.Ask a guest to purchase soda and alcohol (or other beverage choices) for everyone, or ask each guest to each bring their own.

, Once you have a guest list, ask around to find out if your guests have any notable food allergies or other serious dietary restrictions. Communicate these restrictions to the other guests; the potluck could be disastrous if someone brings a peanut-heavy dish while another guest has a severe peanut allergy.


If you have guests who are vegans, vegetarians, or gluten-free, make sure that there will be at least two or three side dishes that they can eat. As long as you’re delegating, consider asking gluten-free and vegan individuals to bring their own gluten-free or vegan side dishes., Planning a Thanksgiving potluck is a large operation, especially if you have a large guest list. If one of your guests offers to come over early and help you cook, or if one wants to provide more than their own share of food, let them.Don’t turn down extra help!

, Thanksgiving potluck hosts typically assume the responsibility of cooking the turkey (or whatever your potluck’s main dish may be). This helps to avoid complications that can result from tasking a guest to transport a large, cooked turkey, and lets you retain control over the central fixture of the meal.If you have a standard or favorite turkey-preparation method, use that. A Thanksgiving potluck is not the time to experiment with a new method of food preparation.

, Since you’re cooking the main dish, each guest should bring a side dish to share. Encourage guests to bring Thanksgiving favorites and home-made dishes, rather than picking up a generic side dish from the store. If you’re concerned that multiple guests may bring similar side dishes, you can always decide who should bring what ahead of time, and simply assign a specific side dish to each guest.It’s important to communicate during this stage of the planning—especially if you’re allowing guests to choose their own side dishes—so that guests don’t double (or triple) up on dishes.
Make sure that the meal will include vegetables, salads, bread-based dishes, and desserts.

, In order to have a stress-free Thanksgiving day, and to be able to deal with any guest-related problems as they arise, try to get the majority of the preparations done a day in advance. This includes cooking the turkey (or other main dish), setting the table, and picking up any last-minute supplies that you hadn’t anticipated needing.You can also pull out all of the Thanksgiving flatware or silverware, plates, glasses, and serving dishes a day in advance, both to save hassle on Thanksgiving and to make sure you have enough of each.
If you’re going to serve drinks that require chilling (e.g. white wine or sangria), put these in the fridge the day before, too.

, To save yourself stress and extra work, don’t bother with a complicated seating chart. Ask guests to seat themselves around the main dining room table; each guest should sit by an already-set place setting. If you’re comfortable, let guests know that they’re free to improvise by sitting on sofas or eating at card tables, as long as they don’t make a mess of your house.If you don’t have a large dining room table and are worried that your guests will be cramped during the meal, re-purpose other side tables, coffee tables, and chairs from your home. Improvise seating where you can., Since you’ll know in advance what each of your guests will be bringing, it’s up to you to coordinate the timing in the kitchen. Some guests will have brought dishes that can be served at room-temperature, while other sides will need to be refrigerated, and some may need to be re-heated in the oven. Time the dishes as effectively as possible, so that the sides and main dish are at their optimal temperature when the meal is served.If a guest needs to heat a dish and the oven is already in use, suggest that they use the microwave or stovetop, if one of these options is appropriate for their dish.

, As the host, it’s your job to have enough backup supplies, in case someone drops a glass (or worse, a serving tray full of food), forgets a crucial ingredient, or cancels at the last minute.Always have extra glasses on hand (even if you’re only using plastic cups), and keep a variety of extra serving plates and utensils in case a guest forgets their own.


Also have extra common cooking supplies such as butter and cream for last-minute emergencies. Pick up a couple extra bottles of wine before the potluck, in case your guests drink more than anticipated or someone else forgets the wine.

Decide when to hold the friendsgiving.,
Choose a location.,
Invite your friends.,
Talk about what each friend will bring.,
Don’t feel trapped by Thanksgiving traditions.,
Finalize the plans.",How to Host a Friendsgiving1," Most friendsgivings are within a week of Thanksgiving, either the weekend before or the weekend after. Each scheduling decision has its own pros and cons. Weigh the decision carefully, and get your friends’ input during the planning stage to find out if most of your friends have a scheduling preference for the friendsgiving.If you schedule your friendsgiving before Thanksgiving, you could use the event to test new recipes and get feedback on some dishes that you want to bring to your family gathering on Thanksgiving. Plus, your friends will probably still be around.
If you hold your friendsgiving the weekend following Thanksgiving, on the other hand, your friends might still be out of town with their own families. Plus, they could be burned out on eating turkey (if you choose to incorporate it).
On the plus side of hosting a friendsgiving after Thanksgiving, though, you can get turkey and lots of other Thanksgiving foods on sale.
If you plan to host a friendsgiving instead of (or in addition to) attending your family’s own Thanksgiving, you and your friends could schedule the friendsgiving on Thanksgiving day.;
, You’ll probably have the friendsgiving at your house, but you need to locate the best place to host the event and find ways to maximize your space. For instance, if you have an outdoor patio with a table that seats eight, but your dining room table only seats four, you’ll probably want to have the friendsgiving outside on the patio.Think about what the weather is usually like in your area in late November. If you’re at a high likelihood of rain or nasty weather, you’ll have no choice but to host your friendsgiving inside.
If you want to host the friendsgiving indoors but don’t have enough space, you might be able to rent furniture from furniture rental companies for the event. Even a few card tables and folding chairs can provide you with the extra seating you need.Alternately, you could hose the friendsgiving at your significant other’s house (with their permission), or at the home of a close friend who has more space.

, Without your friends, you can’t have a friendsgiving. There are several ways to ask your friends to attend your friendsgiving. For instance, you could:Send your friends an email or text message. Write, “Hi, I’m having a friendsgiving on . Would you like to come? If so, can you bring a dish to share with everyone else? Write me back soon with your decision and any questions. : )”
Talk to your friend directly or call your friend on the phone. Ask your friend, “Would you like to come to my friendsgiving celebration? I’m inviting several friends and everyone will bring a dish to share. Are you free on ?”
Don’t invite too many people. Think about how much space you have at your home. If your dining table only seats six, invite six people. If you can make room for extra seats or a foldout table, go for it, but stay conscious of how many friends can eat comfortably at your home.

, At friendsgiving, each friend should bring a dish to share. But you want to ensure that your friends don’t all bring the same dish (ten pumpkin pies, for instance, might be a bit much). Coordinate with your friends to identify a dish that they can provide.If your friends are really passionate about cooking a particular dish or type of food, encourage them to bring their specialty.
For instance, if your friend has a top-notch mac & cheese recipe, encourage them to make and bring that.
Suggest to your friends that they can also buy ready-made foods, and do not have to cook anything from scratch.Let your friends know how many people are coming so they can provide enough to feed the whole group.
If your friend is bringing their significant other, ask them to bring two dishes.
Think about friends with special diets. For instance, if some of your friends are vegan, ask them and a few other friends to make (or buy) vegan dishes. Friends with special diets should be able to have a proper meal, not just a single item.
Ask your friends to have their dishes ready to eat when they arrive at the party. Otherwise, you could end up with a roomful of friends all vying to use the oven.
The only exception to the free choice of dish each friend can bring is the turkey. If you decide to include turkey in your friendsgiving, you – the host – should cook it and the gravy, because nobody wants to transport a big, cooked bird and a pot of gravy to another house., Thanksgiving is associated with several specific foods like turkey, pumpkin pie, cranberry sauce, and mashed potatoes. But friendsgiving isn’t Thanksgiving. You can break the rules, or make new ones. For instance, instead of turkey, you could have sushi. Instead of pumpkin pie, get a cake. You could even choose a themed cuisine (like Chinese or Mexican) and have all the friendsgiving food conform to the theme., When you’ve figured out when the friendsgiving will be, who’s coming, and what everyone is brining, send your friends a mass email with all the information. You could also use an app like Google Calendar to coordinate and finalize all these details. This will give your guests the opportunity to clarify and confirm what or who they’re bringing."
"
Tally your plates and flatware.,
Have snacks and appetizers available.,
Set the table.",How to Host a Friendsgiving2," Before inviting a bunch of guests to your house for friendsgiving, ensure they’ll all be able to get a plate. Count your knives, spoons, plates, bowls, and forks. You should have at least one for every person who is attending, plus one of each for you.If you don’t have enough flatware and plates, purchase some sturdy disposable plates and plasticware for the event.
You could also ask a friend to bring a few extra plates and flatware sets for the friendsgiving.

, Hors d’oeuvres and appetizers provide an opportunity for friends who don’t know each other well to mingle and chat. They also provide a little something to stave off hunger if some of your guests are running late and you don’t want to start the friendsgiving dinner without them, or if some of your dishes aren’t quite ready on time.Pre-made snacks and appetizer platters are readily available at most grocery stores. You might consider getting a meat, cheese, and crackers platter, or a fruit salad.
Veggie trays with carrots, celery, and pepper sticks and ranch (or another veggie dip) is the perfect appetizer for healthy friends.
Have a variety of appetizers ready to appease the various tastes of your friends.
Since snacks should be ready to eat as soon as guests arrive, it’s best to provide the snacks and appetizers yourself unless you have a very trustworthy and reliable friend who you are sure can arrive before anyone else. If you arrange for your trustworthy friend to bring the appetizers and hors d’oeuvres, let them know that you’re counting on them.

, There are many ways to set the table. You could cover the table with an elegant and decorate tablecloth, or you could just leave the bare wood of the table showing. You could place candles or flowers in the center of the table to set the mood, but if you’re cramped for space, you could just reserve your table space for the dishes you and your friends will enjoy.You could set placemats in front of each seat.
You could also wrap silverware in a napkin and place it in front of each seat for a more formal dining experience.
Experiment with different styles before the friendsgiving and find one that works for you. Use your knowledge about your friends and their preferences to find something that will make the event enjoyable and memorable for them, too.
If your cuisine has a theme, your table-setting should conform to that theme, too. For instance, if your friendsgiving theme is Japanese food, you might place a small bust of a geisha or a folding fan in the middle of the table.

"
"
Let your guests seat themselves.,
Provide alcohol.,
Dig in.,
Schedule some activities.,
Send leftovers home with your guests.,
Have a good time.",How to Host a Friendsgiving3," Friendsgiving should be a low-key affair. There’s no need to seat your friends in a formal seating arrangement or use a seating chart to decide who sits where. When your friends come in, say, “Make yourself comfortable and sit wherever you’d like. We’ll eat soon.”If some of your friends don’t know your other friends, introduce them and share something about each with the other that would be of interest to them.
For instance, if your friends Joe and Susan don’t know one another, say to Joe, “This is Susan. She is an astronaut.” Then turn to Susan and say, “This is Joe. He writes about astronauts.”

, As the host, you’ll be responsible for ensuring your guests all have enough to drink. You probably already know your friends’ drinking habits, but if you don’t you could just ask them at some point before the friendsgiving what they like to drink. If your friends don’t drink much (or at all), then you don’t need to have much. But if your friends like drinking during dinner parties and get-togethers, provide an appropriate amount and variety of booze.If you find the cost excessive, you could also ask each of your guests to bring a bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer along with their dish.In addition to alcohol, of course, your friendsgiving should have soda, water, and juice available for people who don’t want to drink.
Don’t forget to stock up on ice for both alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks.

, All the dishes should be placed on the table and passed around, or arranged on the kitchen counter for buffet-style self-service. If your food is arranged on the counter, fold a notecard in half along its vertical axis, then turn it sideways to create a small sign. Write the name of the dish and the name of the person who made it on each card., After dinner, invite your friends to join in card games like 21, poker, or hearts. You and your guests might also enjoy a rousing round of Trivial Pursuit or charades. Think about what sorts of activities you and your friends enjoy and provide the opportunities to do them at your house.To keep the friendsgiving in the spirit of Thanksgiving, you could provide everyone with a small piece of note paper and a pen and invite them to anonymously write something they’re thankful on the notepad and drop it in a jar. During or after the meal, pull out the pieces of paper and read what each person is thankful for.You could also take an informal vote among your friends for the best dish of the night. Don’t vote for yourself!, If you have anything left over at the end of the night, invite each of your guests to take some leftovers with them in resealable containers or plastic bags. This will ensure they have a little something for the road.You might also be able to obtain some disposable takeout containers from certain restaurants. Just approach the restaurant managers and ask if you could have a set of eight or 10 takeout containers and lids for your friendsgiving.

, If you’re having fun, your guests will, too. Even if some small inconvenience occurs – a friend spills their wine on the table, or drops gravy on the carpet – just stay cool and don’t let it get to you. Instead, focus on the big picture – you and your friends are enjoying a great meal, great conversation, and having great fun together."

Incorporate nature and past gifts.,
Add lighting minimally.",How to Decorate a Thanksgiving Table," The best tabletop decisions are ones where you use things you already own and work around that. You can try a tablecloth for a traditional look or a runner for a more modern take.Avoid bright colors in favor of neutral or darker shades inspired by fall. They’re easier to complement and tend to read as more mature.
If you found your tablecloth in storage, be sure to wash and iron it before laying it out.;
, Use this opportunity to ensure that you have space for your entire guest list. If you do combine tables and they don’t align perfectly, try balancing it out with blocks of wood.


If you don't have a spare table, put a piece of plywood on sawhorses (those traditional stands used to hold wood to saw).

, Add personal items if they fit your theme and don't overwhelm the table. Remember that this is a day to thank those around you, but also to appreciate everyone who can’t be.


Did you inherit some jewelry you don’t see yourself wearing? Try using it to wrap napkins.
Antique saucers work well as candle holders.Use vintage books to add charm, height, and depth. Each guest will see it differently, as well.Artists who frequently get art supplies as gifts might consider a paper table runner with pen and marker ""bouquets"" displayed in nice pots., Be strategic about where you place them, however. If they are tall, they could interrupt your guests' view of each other.


Use odorless candles so the smell of the dinner will shine through.

, Everyone wants to feel that they are worth your time, and this is a good time to get that message across creatively. Lettering or calligraphy are popular methods to do this, but an easier alternative is to use a strand of simple multi-colored yarn to create each guest’s first initial on their plate.When deciding the seat layout, be aware which personalities might clash and which might benefit from disparate personalities (e.g. a talkative guest near a shy guest).If you know which guests are left-handed, consider seating them near the end of the table. This helps people stay focused on meaningful conversation instead of apologizing for interruptions.

, Cloth napkins tell the guests that dinner is going to be a special event.They are a good investment if you intend to have other dinner parties in the future, so don’t be afraid to purchase some new ones if you don’t have any.


Add whimsy to the table with patterns or different colored napkins.

, Once you have your menu planned, set out all of the plates that will be used through the course of the meal. Don't include dessert plates.


Don’t worry if you haven’t got a matching set for every guest. Some of the most interesting displays can come out of a mismatched set.Check thrift stores for similar styles to what you already own, or call on friends to loan you some.

, Arrange the fork on the left of the plate, the butterknife on the right (facing left), and the spoon to the right of the knife.


If you have antique cutlery, now’s a fine time to break them out. Along with their personal importance, antique silverware can show your guests how much you appreciate them., Place a water glass and a wine glass at the top-right side of the plate, arranged in the order that they will be used starting at the outside and working in.Mismatched glasses, especially for wine, can bring a lot of charm to the table.

, Arrange the empty dishes around the table, taking care not to encroach on any one guest’s personal space. Pair each dish with its serving utensil at this point, too.


If any guests are bringing food, transfer it to a dish that you already own and account for it in the table setup. Leave nothing to chance.

, Each guest should have easy access to salt, pepper, butter, gravy, cranberries, and other condiments. The general rule of thumb is to provide one condiment for every six people.Also include a pitcher or two of water if you have room.

, You shouldn’t incorporate any plates or silverware for dessert, nor cups for coffee or tea. Instead, keep that collection of things separate but within easy access for a post-dinner pick-me-up.

, Now that you aren’t running around the table as much, set up the chairs.


If your chairs don’t match, arrange them in a way that balances out the eye when you’re looking at it from afar. Place chairs that don't fit in among the everyday chairs.

, After you dress your table, use the style choices to determine how your centerpiece will look. You will also know what space you have available to work with.


Keep your centerpiece low to keep it from your guests' lines of sight.Take note of the minor colors in your linens so you can incorporate them subtly.If you opt to go monochromatic with your centerpiece, use texture to make it pop., Take advantage of the season and use colorful leaves and in-season fruits, vegetables, and berries to decorate. Combine them with antique bowls or tasteful, theme-appropriate gifts.


Add flair to items you've foraged with some gold acrylic paint.Display pine cones with fruit to easily add texture., A small set of tea lights can enhance the candles already on the table. Try to spread out the tea lights to provide equal lighting across the table.


Use battery-powered LED candles for more freedom in your display.Try to avoid using the overhead lights. Your guests will feel more cozy if light comes in at an angle instead of straight down.

Remember the little things they say.,

Confirm with your Valentine.,
Talk with your Valentine about your gift policy.,
Figure out if you are going to buy a gift or make a gift.,

Tell your Valentine exactly what they mean to you.",How to Make Valentine's Day More Meaningful," That may sound simple, but it is easy to forget little sentiments that your significant other might mention offhand. Don’t start scrambling for Valentine’s Day ideas on February 13th- take note of their casual comments leading up to the day. This is crucial to all of the specific details you will need to plan later, regarding things like the meal and the gift.;
, Either is OK! Just make sure that you don’t make your Valentine uncomfortable with your gestures. Find out if they’re into grand gestures or low-key love notes.


Some people proudly claim they’re “anti-Valentine’s Day.” If this is your partner, don’t take that to mean they are anti-love! No one says no to a little extra affection and encouragement on Valentine’s Day- even if they insist they don’t want to celebrate.
Make sure you take their day-to-day routine into consideration when you start planning your meaningful Valentine’s Day. No one wants to be late to work because of a surprise breakfast-in-bed, or be forced to carry a life-size teddy bear on a New York subway.

, What makes your Valentine smile? Focus on their unique characteristics. Sure, the Valentine’s Day section of a grocery store is an easy place to start your planning, but that doesn’t make for a meaningful day.


Don’t feel obligated to plan the traditional celebration or buy the cliché gift. Whether your Valentine likes beef jerky, reading trashy tabloids, or going to kickboxing class, try to incorporate their favorite things into the day. This shows that you have taken note of the things that make them happy.
Through every step of the planning process, make sure that you create an experience tailored to your Valentine, and your Valentine only

, This is important. If you scramble to put together your special Valentine’s Day, it will be pretty obvious. Give yourself plenty of time to make sure everything is perfect.


If you are planning on taking your Valentine out to eat, make sure to make reservations far in advance. Restaurants book up quickly and the extra time will ensure you can eat where you want. The same goes for any activities or excursions you want to take your Valentine on.
If you are ordering a gift online, give yourself extra time for shipping. It wouldn’t be ideal to give your Valentine an “I. O. U.”
If you’re taking the creative route for your special day, give yourself plenty of time to pull it all together.

, Does he or she love eating at a certain restaurant, or prefer dining in? Do they relish any opportunity to dress up, or do they prefer being casual? Remember, a meaningful Valentine’s Day doesn’t look the same for every couple. A five-star restaurant and a night of dancing may be perfect for some, but Netflix and their favorite take-out could be the ticket for another., Even if you want to surprise them, make sure they are available and able to do anything you’ve planned. Feel free to keep the specifics to yourself, but at least let your partner the general plan. Nothing can put a damper on Valentine’s Day quite like showing up to a fancy restaurant in jeans or having to bail on a special trip because of work obligations. Just make sure they’ve penciled you in!

, Decide if you want to exchange gifts or if you want to skip them all together. This doesn’t ruin any surprise, but it will prevent any awkwardness if only one person shows up with a gift.


Remember, sharing an experience together can be a gift in itself. Don’t feel the need to drop major bucks on an extravagant gift.

, This is when your careful memories (and possibly note-taking!) can come in handy. Did they point out something at the mall that they really want? Have they ever told you about their favorite gift they’ve received? All of these details will help you determine what to get them.Think about your Valentine’s favorite things to do. If they’re a runner, give them some new running gear. If they’re a music buff, how about an iTunes gift card or concert tickets? Your gift should show your Valentine that you have taken note of the specific things they enjoy.

, Whether you are making a gift, buying a gift, or not exchanging gifts at all, your words are the most special thing you can give your Valentine. This is your chance to be as sappy, funny, or creative as you want. A handwritten note will show your Valentine that you spent time finding the perfect words for them, and they'll have a permanent memento from the special day.Your Valentine's card is a good place to show your Valentine how committed you are to them. Let them know that your feelings are not fleeting. Cards that promise loyalty and commitment will leave your significant other feeling loved.This is also a good place to explain exactly why you chose what you chose. Let your Valentine know why you think they’re so special, and how this gift complements that.
Even if you aren’t exchanging gifts, a sweet card never goes unappreciated. This is an inexpensive and extremely meaningful way to show how much you care.

, This should be done all year, but especially on this holiday. Don't let them forget how special they are and how much they mean to you. You have the chance to tell your partner just how much you admire and appreciate them, so don't take it for granted. Too often, people wait until it is too late.Your words are important, but your nonverbal cues can mean just as much. Maintain eye contact to show your Valentine that they have your undivided attention.
Make sure that your body language is communicating the same message as your mouth. Try to lean in towards your partner, keeping your arms uncrossed, to show them there is no place you'd rather be."

, It can be hard to make an individual card for every person, especially if you have a large class. Think about making the same basic card for everyone. You can personalize them by adding things like classmates names, initials, and a brief personal message.


You can try cutting out a series of hearts from construction paper, for example. Then you can slice a small slit down the center of the cards and put a small toy arrow through each one. These are simple cards to make you can easily personalize by writing your classmates' initials on the cards., It can be a nice touch to include a small treat in the cards. If you're including tiny gifts, consider what things would be easy to attach to the cards.Stop by a local craft store. These places often sell tiny rubber animal toys, like toy dinosaurs or zoo animals. You could try taping a toy to every card.
Pick up some tissue paper and bunch it up into a shape of a flower. You can give everyone fake flowers for Valentine's Day.
Buy some Valentine's Day themed pencils. If you're doing hearts with arrows, you can even attach construction paper on either ends of the pencils to make small arrows.

, If you're not sure what direction to go, it may help to examine your current craft inventory. Instead of buying new supplies, it may be easier to work with what you currently have.


For example, if you have a lot of construction paper and water color paints, you can make small heart-shaped cards decorated with water colors.

, Many schools have rules about food and ban things like sugar and candy. If your school has strict rules, include healthy foods with the cards. You could include something like dried fruit or trail mix made up of pretzels, popcorn, and healthy cereal.Make sure you know if anyone in your class has dietary restrictions. If some students are gluten free, for example, be sure to stock their card with gluten free snacks.

, One cute idea is to make hand-shaped cards that form a heart in the middle. Trace your hands side by side on two pieces of construction paper. Make sure your left and right index fingers are touching, as well as your left and right thumbs. This should form a heart shape in the area between your hands. You can then cut your handprints, and the space between your index fingers and thumbs, to make a hand-shaped card that opens up to reveal a heart shape.To personalize the cards, you can write special messages inside of them as well as things like your classmates' names and initials. For example, write something like, ""Thanks for giving me a hand during math class!"" if there is a student in your grade who helps you with your homework.

, If you have animal lovers in your class, you can make them cards shaped like cats. You can make a cat shape out of hearts by cutting out different pieces of construction paper.Draw one big heart on a piece of construction paper. Then, cut out two smaller hearts of the same shape.
On a blank greeting card, glue the big heart upside down. The curved parts of the heart will be your cat's lips. Then, you can add the smaller hearts on the other end of the heart. These are the cat's ears.
You can draw a heart shape for the nose. Draw on eyes or glue googly eyes to the cat.
If you want, you can use the hearts to make other animal shapes. Pointing the smaller hearts downward, for example, could help you make droopy ears like a dog.

, If you're not great at drawing, use stamps and ink to decorate cards. You can buy blank greeting cards at a craft store and use Valentine's Day colors, like pink and red, for ink. Use stamps to stamp on letters and shapes onto cards. You can also buy ink and stamps at a craft store.You can opt for traditionally Valentine's Day shapes, like hearts and arrows. You can also personalize the cards. For example, if one of your classmates loves dinosaurs, use dinosaur shapes.
You can write cute messages in the cards based on the shapes you're including. For example, if one of your classmates likes cards, stamp some images of race cars in their card and write something like, ""You make my heart race.""

, Get a pack of tiny chocolate hearts from the grocery store. You can then glue these hearts onto cards to make shapes and designs. This is a great way to give a classmate a treat as well as a card.<


Cut out the shape of a stegosaurus on cardboard paper and glue it to the card. Use the candy hearts as the stegosaurus's spikes.
Draw the shape of a butterfly, but use the hearts as its wings.
Use the hearts as petals of a flower.

, If you have watercolors, use them to paint the inside of blank cards. This is a good option if you're trying to make a personalized card for everyone. You can paint different and use different colors on each card to reflect your classmates' individual personalities.If you're not great at drawing or painting freely, you can use stencils to create shapes on each card.

, Some schools have rules against handing out cards.Make sure you talk to your teacher before passing out your Valentine's Day cards. You do not want to end up in trouble for passing out cards in school.


If your school forbids handing out Valentines during class, you can try passing them out at lunch or recess.
You can also see if it's okay to leave your cards in your classmates' lockers or cubbies.

, If your class has a Valentine's Day party, this is usually the best place to pass out the cards. You can go around the room and give everyone the special card you made for them.However, make sure cards are allowed. Remember, some schools do not allow you to hand out cards for holidays.

, If some kids are absent, write their names down somewhere. You want to make sure you get them their Valentines when they get back to school. You don't want anyone to feel left out.

Fly the kite.",How to Make Inexpensive Valentine's Gifts," This can be a rather lengthy crafts project, but it is inexpensive to make.

Use regular printer paper and fold it like an accordion. Along the folds, draw hearts and cut them out so you have a bunch of heart-shaped little ""cards"" that open.



 


On the outside, write ""I love..."" on each heart. On the inside, write one trait you love about your partner, or one activity you love to do with them (for example: I love... holding hands with you). If you are particularly creative and you have enough cash to invest in a few colored pencils or markers, color the front of the hearts in different shades of pink and red.






Either scatter the hearts in your partner's apartment, hide them in places they usually go (next to their toothbrush, next to the coffee maker, etc.), or use sticky tape to attach them to their bedroom door or other place they will notice them.





;
, Choose a nice picture of the two of you and print it out on photo paper. Many drugstores offer that service, it won't break the bank.

Search for simple recipes and see what you can accomplish., Depending on the ingredients you choose, this can be expensive, but it doesn't have to be. It can be something as simple as spaghetti with marinara sauce and garlic bread as the main course and brownies with vanilla ice cream for dessert. The most expensive part about that would be Parmesan cheese. Pair it with your favourite beverages, play ""That's Amore"" on YouTube, and you have your own candle-light dinner for two. You could even buy a large pack of tea lights and arrange them in a heart shape. Light them right before your partner arrives.

, These options can be combined with dinner or the chocolates, or the poem, if you like. If it is possible for you to go to an area together where the stars are visible (away from city lights), go there together (maybe after dinner) and hold hands while looking into the night sky. Bring blankets to stay warm. You could take this opportunity to recite your poem, or simply talk about your feelings. If you think your partner would appreciate a dance, play a song you like and dance in a room large enough. Modern cell phones allow you to put on music wherever you want. If that's not an option, stay reasonably close to your computer and turn on music on youtube.com or an online radio station. If you're in a remote area and have a car, you could even combine the stargazing and the dance, find a song on your car stereo, and dance with your partner outside., Look through the window, if the day seems to be windy then grab your old kite (bet you have one in garage) otherwise you can refresh old skills by building the new one. We all are kids deep inside. So let this Valentine’s Day to be full of fun."

, If they feel out of place, explain to them that Jewish law considers it a blessing to invite guests over. Tell them the Passover service includes the invitation: ""Let all who are hungry, come and eat.""

, Non-Jews attending Passover Seder can become quickly overwhelmed by all that's going on. Let them know what to expect ahead of time, and let them know that Seders can run for 2 to 4 hours.

, Tell your non-Jewish friends that because the Jews were on the run, they didn't have time to wait for the bread to rise, so they ate it flat, which is called unleavened bread, and it's eaten for eight days. The only kosher food they're allowed to buy is food that says ""Kosher for Passover,"" ""May Be Used for Passover,"" and ""Kosher for Passover All Year Round.""

, This usually includes gefilte fish, chicken soup with matzo balls, and either chicken or turkey, with cooked honey carrots, and applesauce, and non-dairy desserts.

, It should have 3 matzo crackers in the middle of the plate, a burnt shank bone, horseradish root, parsley, salt water, a hard-boiled egg with a burnt shell, 3 matzo crackers, and charoset—also haroset or charoses (a mixture of nuts, apples, and wine). Fill the Cup of Elijah with Passover wine.

, Make sure it's someone they feel comfortable asking questions to.

, Tell them that Hebrew is read backwards, and most of the Haggadahs have backwards pages.

, Include your non-Jewish guests in the questions and answers. Emphasize that asking and answering questions is an important part of the Seder, and they should feel free to ask why something is done.

If you're not Jewish, ask your Jewish friends questions about the Passover Seder, and go to Jewish websites to read about the History of Passover.,
Wear appropriate attire.,
Passover Haggadahs are special books provided to teach the steps of the Passover Seder and to tell the Story of Passover.,
Usually, the kosher dietary laws are observed - NO mixing meat with dairy, NO shellfish, and NO pork.,

, Try to wear something that's respectful and formal. For men, a nice suit and tie would work. For women, wear a nice dressy dress and shoes. If the family is Orthodox, wear a modest dress with modest shoes.

, The Haggadah also includes Passover songs.

, Passover dinners serve Passover wine and the main course is usually chicken or turkey, which is meat, so non-dairy desserts are served.

Shorten the Seder to 2 hours instead of 4.,

Have some kid-friendly food options.,
Talk to your children about The Four Sons.,
Make sure your children are not alone.,
Have a great prize for finding the Afikoman (Hebrew: ""dessert"").,
End the Seder at bedtime.,
Give them Passover grape juice.",How to Make Passover Kid Friendly," You can order online or buy children's Haggadot (Hebrew: ""telling"") so you can read to your children the Story of Passover.;
, When telling of the 10 Plagues, have the children make prop bags for them, such as finger puppets which represent each of the 10. Also, encourage them to make and perform a Passover play, with the telling of the Story of Passover.

, Not everyone enjoys eating maror (bitter herbs) on Passover. Instead of horseradish or wasabi, try giving the children lettuce. While it is not as bitter as horseradish, it is certainly not pleasant tasting when eaten by itself.

, If you have 4 sons, you'll need to have one child playing the intelligent son, one child playing the wicked son, one child playing a simple son, and one child playing the son who does not know to ask a question. This can be entertaining for both the kids and the adults at your Seder.

, There is nothing more boring than being the only kid at the Seder table. When inviting friends and family, make sure that your child will have kids their own age to play and interact with. If your space is large enough, set up a separate children's table.

, The Afikoman is a half-sheet of matzo, which is hidden earlier in the service, and is a fun game for kids to play. When hiding the Afikoman, keep in mind the age and height of the children so that the game may be fun for all. It's not fair to have a four foot 7 year old reaching for a shelf which a ten year old could easily reach.

, You don't want to rush for the door when the Seder is over, as this allows for no time for your children to say goodbye to their friends. Give a good half-hour before it is time for bed, so that there can be some additional playtime. Also, if your child is sitting at a table all night, they will not be tired when it comes to bed, so allowing them to have some physical activity is a good idea.

, You don't want your child drinking four cups of wine during the Seder. Instead, give them grape juice.

",How to Prepare for Passover," Before Passover, the whole house needs to be cleaned so that all leavened bread products are removed. Don't forget your oven, stove, and even your toaster!;
,


Prepare for the Shabbat before Passover begins. Shabbat HaGadol is called so as it marks the beginning of redemption. There is a lot about it in the Bible verses starting at Exodus 12:3.

, To save you from worrying about fattening foods, buy lots of fresh fruits and vegetables to leave you healthy and full!

,, It's a great idea to have Haggadot that has both English and Hebrew, with English transliterations to make the service easier for everyone.

, It is important to prepare the six symbolic symbolic items:


Zeroah (roasted shank bone)
Beitzah (hard-boiled egg)
Maror (horseradish root)
Charoset (mixture of chopped apples, walnuts, and red wine)
Karpas (sprigs of parsley)
Chazeret (Romaine lettuce)

, The table is the centerpiece of your meal, so be sure to arrange it well. There are a number of things you'll need on the table like festive tablecloth and napkins, kosher for Passover dishes, flatware, water glasses, and wine glasses; small dishes of salt water for dipping, enough bottles of wine and grape juice for each person to have four cups, a special wine cup reserved for Elijah, a special water cup reserved for Miriam, a plate with 3 pieces of matzah on it and a cover over it, the Seder Plate and Haggadot, which has Passover prayers and songs, etc.

, Begin early so you're not rushing to finish everything the day before.

Mark the date for Passover.,
Take time off from work.,
Get rid of all leavening products.,
Clean your home.,
Avoid forbidden foods for Passover.",How to Celebrate Passover1," Passover lasts for eight days. It begins at sundown in early spring, known as the month of Nissan in the Hebrew calendar. The start date of Passover will change every year based on when Nissan occurs in the Hebrew calendar. Consult a Hebrew calendar for the exact dates for Passover in your year.If you are going to a Passover celebration hosted by someone who is Jewish, ask them for the exact dates for Passover.;
, Passover is divided into two parts. The first two days and the last two days of Passover are considered holidays, where no work is done. This includes driving, writing, or using electrical devices. However, you can cook and carry items outdoors when needed. The middle four days during Passover are called Chol Hamoed and you can do work during these days.It can be an adjustment to not do work during the first two days and last two days of Passover. Do any work you need to get done before Passover begins or save it for the middle four days of Passover so you do not break with tradition.

, Any leavening products, called chametz in Hebrew, should be removed before the beginning of Passover. This is to honor the unleavened bread that the Israelites ate when they left Egypt. It is part of the Passover tradition to avoid consuming or owning any food or drink that contains wheat products. Clean your home of any of these products to prepare for Passover.This means any wheat, barley, rye, oats, or spelt products. You should also remove any bread, cake, cookies, cereal, pizza, pasta, and alcoholic beverages.
This does not include products like baking powder or baking soda.

Chametz is considered the 'anthesis' (the flowering period of a plant) of matzah and a representation of egotism. Getting rid of chametz is a key part of celebrating Passover and embracing selflessness.

, Another key aspect of Passover is cleaning the home before Passover begins. Do a thorough cleaning of every nook and cranny of your home, from room to room. Dust, mop, sweep, and wipe each surface in your home. Often the weeks leading to Passover are spent cleaning the home to prepare., During Passover, you cannot eat certain meats such as pork, shellfish, lobster, shrimp, crab, rabbit, and any seafood without fins or scales, such as swordfish and sturgeon. You cannot eat any products made with these ingredients.It is also tradition to not eat meat in combination with dairy during Passover. So you do not have cheese, butter, or cream sauce on beef or chicken.
Fish and eggs are allowed during Passover as long as they are served with dairy or with meat.
When you shop for Passover foods, look for the labels saying: ""Kosher for Passover,"" ""May be used for Passover,"" and ""Kosher for Passover and all year round.""

The seder plate plays a central role in the Passover celebration. It consists of six symbolic foods, plus three pieces of matzah which will be placed on a separate plate. The six symbolic foods are:The Bitter Herbs. Traditionally this would be horseradish but parsley, green onion, or celery can also be used.
The Paste or Charoset. This is a mixture which represents the mortar used by the slaves to build the pyramids of Egypt. It is usually a mixture of apples, nuts and wine. A variety of recipes can be found online.
The Vegetable. This is a not-bitter, root vegetable such as a boiled potato. This represents the hard labor of the slaves.
The Shankbone. This is a shankbone, usually lamb or goat, which symbolizes the sacrificial lamb of Passover.
The Egg. A hard-boiled egg used to symbolize the offering made in the days of the Temple.
The Lettuce. This is usually romaine, which like the bitter herbs symbolizes the bitterness of slavery.

, This is a book which will contain the necessary prayers, as well as the procedures and story of Passover for the seder. It is a useful guide for how to perform the seder properly.


You can find a copy of the Haggadah in English online.
You can also listen to a recitation of “The Order of the Seder” online.

, This is a blessing said over wine in honor of Passover. Say the Kiddush blessing and then drink the first of four cups of wine.You can then pour the second cup of wine but do not drink it yet.

, Wash your the hands without a blessing. This is to prepare for the eating of the Karpas., This is a vegetable, usually parsley. Dip the vegetable in the saltwater and eat it.The vegetable is a symbol of the humble origins of the Jewish people. The salt water is a symbol of the tears shed due to slavery.

, Break the middle of the three matzah on the table, known as ""yachatz"". Return the smaller part to the pile. The larger part will be returned to the pile for the afikoman., Tell the story of Passover, which is the story of the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt. Have the youngest child ask the traditional four questions, and drink the second cup of wine. The traditional four questions are:""What has changed, this night, from all the other nights? That in all other nights we eat both chametz and matzah, on this night, we eat only matzah?""
""What has changed, this night, from all the other nights? That in all other nights we eat many vegetables, on this night, maror?""
""What has changed, this night, from all the other nights? That in all other nights we do not dip vegetables even once, on this night, we dip twice?""
""What has changed, this night, from all the other nights? On all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, either sitting or reclining. On this night, on this night, we all recline.""
At the end of the Maggid, a blessing is recited over the second cup of wine and then the cup is drunk.

, This time, include a blessing. This is to prepare for the eating of the matzah., Recite the traditional blessing for eating bread, called the ha-motzi, over the matzos., Recite the blessing for eating matzah and eat a small portion of the matzah., Bless and eat the bitter herbs. These can be dipped in the Charoset., Make a sandwich of matzah, bitter herbs and charoset. Eat this., This is the big dinner. You can eat whatever you want (as long as it does not include leavening) but gefilte fish, matzah ball soup, and brisket are most common., This is when the afikoman, the piece of matzah set aside earlier in the meal, is to be eaten as a dessert. Traditionally, children will steal it earlier in the meal and hide it for the adults to ransom back with candy or toys.Another option is to have the adults hide the afikoman. Then, the children can be paid in candy or toys to find and return it.

, Say the after-meal blessing and drink the third cup of wine. Then, pour the fourth cup of wine for the prophet Elijah and open the door of the home briefly to allow him entrance., Recite psalms, bless the fourth cup of wine, and drink it.

, Conclude the seder with wishes for the next year, songs, stories, or expressions of affection and faith."

Watch Passover movies.,
Sing Passover songs.,
Make Passover crafts.",How to Celebrate Passover3," You can watch movies relating to Passover with your family or children. Not only can this entertain the whole family, but it can serve to remind everyone of the importance of the holiday. It can also open up a discussion the history of the Jewish people and the purpose of Passover.


One good option is the film The Prince of Egypt, which is appropriate and fun for children but also has music and acting excellent enough to entertain an adult.
Another good movie to watch is The Ten Commandments starring Charlton Heston. This is a classic and will appeal to both the young and old.
A good, morn modern movie to watch, especially if your family likes a little more drama, is The Devil's Arithmetic. In this film, a young Jewish girl (played by Kirsten Dunst) who is tired of celebrating Passover is magically transported back in time to a Nazi camp. She learns the true meaning of struggle, the importance of remembering, and the value of family and heritage.

, You can sing Passover songs, either modern or traditional, on your own or with your family or friends. Many can easily be found on Youtube but here are three good ones:


A good traditional song for the whole family is Dayenu, which is upbeat and great for singing as a group.
Shalom Sesame (A Jewish subset of Sesame Street) made an excellent Passover film that contains lots of great songs for young kids.
For fun takes on modern songs, listen to The Ein Prat Fountainheads ""Dayenu, Coming Home"" or The Maccabeats ""Les Misérables, A Passover Story"".

, There are a number of crafts you can make with children which will get them involved with and excited about the holiday, as well as allowing them to feel necessary and helpful.


Make a matzo house. This can be done similarly to making a gingerbread house and makes a great centerpiece. Make it extra exciting for the kids by building the matzo house with chocolate and caramel. Just be sure any candy you use is kosher for Passover.
Make a passover seder plate. You can get your kids to make and decorate a plate and bowls for the seder plate. This can be a good Passover activity for children of any age group.
Make an afikomen bag. You can also make a custom bag for the afikoman. Sew or buy a basic bag and let your kids decorate it with drawings, baubles, or any images related to Passover.

Peel, core, and mince 1 to 2 Macintosh apples.
Shell and mince 1 cup (.24 l) of walnuts.
Combine the apples and walnuts and drizzle a kosher vegan red wine over it.
Add cinnamon and sugar to your desired taste.;
, The lamb shank represents the outstretched arm of God that helped the Israelites escape bondage in Egypt. Today, many vegan Jews substitute it with a red beet. You may also be able to substitute the lamb shank for a yam or another large vegetable.Depending on preference, you could roast the beat and place it as a whole on the plate, or you could cut it up into several pieces.

, Bitter herbs stand for the bitterness of the slavery the Israelites endured in Egypt. You don’t need to worry about substitutions when serving bitter herbs. Feel free to serve one of the following:


Radishes
Horseradish
Celery
Romaine lettuce, The beitzah represents the cycle of life and/or the idea of a new beginning. Many vegan Jews substitute the egg for an avocado or a white eggplant.


Consider serving slices of avocado or eggplant sprinkled with salt, pepper, and olive oil., Karpas represent spring and the idea of a new beginning outside of Egypt. There are a variety of greens you can use as karpas. They include:


Parsley, which is a traditional choice
Kale
Green onions
Celery leaves, You’ll also need to serve four cups of wine over the course of the Seder. While many wines are vegan, not all are. However, you’ll need to find a vegan wine that is also Kosher for Passover.


Look for a vegan wine that is marked with a P for Kosher for Passover.
Manischewitz is both Kosher for Passover and vegan., There are a variety of substitutes you can prepare to take the place of gefilte fish. One of the most popular is made from potatoes, parsnips, and onions. To prepare the gefilte fish substitute:


Peel, cube, and boil 1 potato, 1 parsnip, and 1 onion for 10 minutes. Mash them after you've boiled them.
Mix in 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of salt, 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of pepper, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of celery salt, and 1 tablespoon (7.5 ml) of matzo meal.
Shape the mixture into gefilte fish shaped patties.
Boil the vegetable stock and then add a whole carrot and the fish patties. Leave them in for 4 to 5 minutes., Mushroom and walnut pate is a great substitute for chopped liver. You can serve it as an appetizer before the meal or as part of the main course. To prepare it:


Heat a skillet on medium and add two tablespoons (15 ml) of olive oil.
Cook 10 ounces (.30 l) of chopped cremini mushrooms and add 1 small chopped onion. Let them simmer for about ten minutes or until they’re soft and brown.
Add ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of dried thyme, ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of dried rosemary, ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of herbs de Provence, ¼ (1.25 ml) teaspoon of black pepper.
Pour the mixture into a food processor and add 1 cup (120 ml) of chopped walnuts, ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of salt, and 1 tablespoon (7.4 ml) of water.
Process the mixture until it is smooth and paste-like and refrigerate., Matzo ball soup is almost a requirement for a Passover Seder. As a result, you’ll need to prepare a vegan version of it to serve yourself and/or your guests. To cook it:


Create a mix of 1 cup (120 ml) matzo meal, 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of potato starch, a quarter cup (30 ml) of vegetable oil, 1 cup of water, ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of baking soda, ¼ teaspoon (1.25 ml) of salt, and ¼ teaspoon (1.25 ml) of garlic. Use your hands to form these into golf ball-sized balls.
Place a stalk of (chopped) celery, 1 medium (chopped) carrot, a quarter onion (chopped), and 32 ounces (.95 l) of vegetable broth into a large pot. Bring your ingredients to a boil.
Drop the matzo balls into the boiling broth. Allow them to sit for about 20 minutes, then remove them and allow the broth to cook for another half an hour to one hour., Just because you are vegan, doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy your grandmother’s famous matzo ball soup recipe. All you need to do is use egg replacer instead of eggs in your recipe.


Substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth, if your recipe includes it., Chocolate matzo brittle allows you to take a holiday staple – matzo – and create a great dessert for your entire family. To create it:


Drop 1 cup (240 ml) of vegan semi-sweet chocolate chips and a half a teaspoon of cinnamon into a small saucepan.
Turn the saucepan on low heat. Once the chocolate has melted, break up 2 pieces of matzo. Stir the chocolate and matzo together.
After the matzo pieces are coated in chocolate, take them out and lay them onto a piece of parchment paper.
Sprinkle the matzo pieces with your choice of nuts and dried fruit. Consider using pecans, raisins, or cranberries.
Break into smaller pieces before you serve., Macaroons are a traditional Mediterranean dessert that have become associated with Passover. To make your own vegan macaroons:


Combine 1 cup (240 ml) of coconut milk, 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of sugar, and 1/4th teaspoon (1.25 ml) of salt in a saucepan. Place the saucepan on medium heat and bring to a boil. Then, allow it to simmer until it thickens.
Take it off the burner and mix in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla and 2 cups (.48 l) of shredded coconut.

Prepare your paint and crafting surface.,
Form a fist.,
Apply the paint to one side of your fist.,
Stamp the paint onto the surface.,
Dip your pinky finger into the paint.,
Add toes above the base print.,
Use your other hand to make a matching footprint.,
Let dry.",How to Make Leprechaun Footprints1," You will need green craft paint and a flat, hard surface of some sort, such as heavy paper or a glass window pane.


Choose a water-soluble paint, especially if you plan to make these footprints on a window or other surface you eventually want to clean.






Tempera paint works best. For easier clean up, mix a few drops of liquid dish soap into the paint before applying it.You will also need a paintbrush to apply the paint with or a shallow dish to pour the paint into.






To limit the potential mess, lay newspaper or a plastic drop cloth down over your working surface.





;
, Curl your fingers into the palm of your hand, making sure that the tip of your pinky finger touches the center horizontal line of your palm.


Your hands should be clean before you start this project.







, Use your free hand to coat your paintbrush in green paint. Brush the entire pinky side of your fist, from the tip of your pinky finger to the base of your wrist.


Alternatively, you can pour the paint into a shallow dish and lightly dunk the pinky side of your fist into the paint. Hold your hand over the dish for a few seconds to allow excess paint to drip off.







, Press the paint-covered side of your fist flat onto your painting surface.Press straight down using firm pressure and lift your hand straight up. Do not wiggle or twist your hand since doing so may distort the shape of the leprechaun footprint.






The resulting shape will act as the base of one footprint.







, Use your paintbrush to apply a little green paint to your pinky finger. You only need enough to cover the tip.


Alternatively, you could also pour the paint into a small dish and dip your pinky directly into it. Let the excess paint drip off for a few seconds before proceeding.

, Press five small dots about the wide part of your green base print. The dots should curve along the upper edge of the base print and stand apart at even intervals from one side to another.

Note that the first print should be positioned over the short side of the base. This will be the ""big toe,"" and it should be the biggest of the five dots.






The remaining dots should get progressively smaller until you reach the pinky toe.







, Follow the same procedure with your opposite hand to create a footprint for the opposite foot.


Apply green paint to the side of a fist made with your opposite hand.






Press this fist onto the painting surface near the first print.






Use your pinky finger to paint five toes along the top of this second print.







, Let the paint dry before using the painted surface.


Note that you should let the paint dry in between sets of footprints to avoid smearing one set while you make another. If you do not have the time to wait, make sure that you start at the top of your painting surface and work your way down or backwards so that you do not have to reach over the existing footprints to create new ones.

Prepare your paint and crafting surface.,
Find a pair of baby shoes or doll shoes.,
Dip the shoes in the paint.,
Stamp the paint onto the surface.,
Let dry.",How to Make Leprechaun Footprints2," Use green craft paint and a flat, smooth surface. The surface can be anything from a sheet of paper to a kitchen table or a glass window pane.


Water-soluble paint works best and is absolutely essential if you plan to wash the paint off later.






You may have the best luck with green tempera paint. If you want to make the paint even easier to clean up, stir in a few drops of liquid dish soap before you apply the paint to your painting surface.






You will either need a paintbrush or a shallow bowl to pour the paint into.






Lay newspaper or a plastic drop cloth down over your working surface to limit the potential mess.







, The size shoes are entirely up to you, but since leprechauns are shorter than humans, their shoes need to be smaller than the average adult's shoes. Preferably, the shoes will even be smaller than those of any kids you intend to track the footprints in an attempt to find the leprechaun.


For “large” leprechauns, choose baby shoes or doll shoes that fit and 18-in (45.72-cm) doll.
For “small” leprechauns, use doll shoes from an 11.5-in (29.21-cm) doll.
If possible, use doll or baby boots. Sneakers will work in a pinch, but avoid high heeled doll shoes.

, Dunk the bottom of one shoe directly into a small puddle of green paint poured into a small, shallow dish.


Let the excess paint drip off for a few seconds before continuing. Too much paint will distort the shape of the footprint.






Alternatively, you could apply the paint to the bottom of the shoe or boot with a paintbrush. Dip the paintbrush into the green paint and apply the paint to the bottom of the shoe. This method tends to be less messy.







, Press the painted shoe straight down onto your painting surface using firm pressure.


Do not wiggle or twist the shoe since doing so may distort the shape of the leprechaun footprint.






This print will be the entire footprint for one leprechaun.






Repeat with the other shoe to create the other footprint.







, Allow the paint dry before using the painted surface.


You should let the paint dry in between painting sets of footprints to avoid smearing one set while you make another. If you do not have the time to wait, start at the top of your painting surface and work your way down or backwards so that you do not have to reach over the existing footprints to create new ones.

Mix green food coloring into white icing.Add 10 to 20 drops of green food coloring into a can of standard, store-bought white icing.,
Transfer the icing into a pastry bag.,
Set your plate.,
Tuck a small gold coin underneath your food.,
Draw small ovals leading up to the coin.",How to Make Leprechaun Footprints3," Continue stirring until the color is evenly dispersed throughout the icing.


The amount of food coloring will determine how deep the green is. More food coloring will produce a darker green, while less food coloring will create a pastel green. If you add too much frosting, however, you could distort the consistency of the frosting.






Note that the frosting needs to be white before you begin. You will not be able to color chocolate frosting, strawberry frosting, or another type of frosting that already has a color to it.







, Scoop the green frosting into a pastry bag equipped with a smooth letter writing tip. You do not need any fancy sort of tip. Instead, a plain tip that only produces straight lines is preferable.


The amount of frosting you need to scoop into the bag will vary depending on how many footprints you want to make.






If you do not have a pastry bag, cut a small corner from a resealable plastic bag and transfer the green frosting into that, instead.







, You can set your plate with any food you want and in any manner you want. Ideally, though, in order to make it seem as though a leprechaun has been there, you should take a few nibbles or cut away a bite-shaped chunk of food from one of the items on your plate.


Possible examples of appropriate plate settings include:






A sandwich with a bite mark in it






Chips with “nibbled” edges






A cupcake or cookie with a small chunk “nibbled” out of it

, Place a small gold token underneath the “nibbled” portion of the food. This will be the end point for your leprechaun and the end of the footprint trail.


You could also use a chocolate coin wrapped in gold foil.
Leprechauns are associated with treasure, so any leprechaun willing to take a bite out of your child's lunch will likely leave that child a gold coin in payment.

, Use your pastry bag of frosting to draw small, narrow green ovals from the edge of the plate to the coin hidden beneath the food. Vary the arrangement of the ovals so that they look like sets of footprints rather than simply being a single straight dotted line.


Get creative with your leprechaun's path. Have the leprechaun walk around foods he doesn't like and step over and onto the food he does decide to sample.

Choose mild-flavored white fish.,
Clean and fillet the fish if necessary.,
Cut the fish fillets into one inch (2.54 cm) thick slices.,
Put the fish stock on the stove to boil.,
Place the fish into a food processor or blender.,
Use the chop or pulse setting to blend the fish.,
Add spices or grated vegetables.,
Form oval patties of the fish mixture.,
Place the fish patties into the simmering stock.,
Cover the pot and cook until the patties are firm.,
Use a slotted spoon to remove the gefilte fish once it has cooked.",How to Make Gefilte Fish," Whether you buy whole or filleted, gefilte fish is made with a combination of various freshwater, white-meat fish. Carp, whitefish, pike, grouper, cod, and halibut are used in various recipes. Two parts whitefish and one part pike is a standard combination in many gefilte fish dishes.If you buy from a fishmonger, ask to keep the head, fins, and tail for use in cooking a more traditional fish stock. It’s okay to buy fillets and buy fish stock separately, as well.
You also have the option to buy pre-made gefilte fish patties to use in your dish. If you choose to buy gefilte fish in a jar, you won’t need to do anything except heat it up.
The amount of fish you need depends on how much gefilte fish you want to make. A relatively small batch requires two to three pounds of fish.;
, If you are using freshly caught fish, or whole fish from a butcher or fishmonger, you’ll need to clean, gut, and fillet the fish. This can be a time consuming and messy process, so buying prepared fish is easier.

, Lay the fish on a cutting board and grab a paring knife. Cut the fish across the width into slices that are ½ inch (1.27 cm) to one inch (2.54 cm) thick. You’ll use a blender or food process next, and it works best when you use small slices of fish rather than an entire fillet., While you continue preparing the gefilte fish patties, pour your fish stock into a saucepan to begin heating. Once it boils, turn it to medium heat to simmer until the patties are ready to be cooked. Use fish stock from the store or make your own from scratch.For added flavor, throw some onion, carrots, and celery into the stock while it boils. This is an option based on your personal preference. A good proportion is two large carrots, two sticks of celery, and half of an onion, all chopped.
Use a one or two quart (.9-1.9 L) saucepan filled half-full with fish stock.

, Depending on the size of your food processor and the amount of fish you are making, it’s best to not chop it all up at once. Put about half of the fish into the food processor or blender, then repeat the following steps with the second half.


Since gefilte fish is generally made up of multiple types of fish, be sure to place some of each fish into the blender so it forms into a somewhat consistent mixture.

, The chopping part of making gefilte fish can be tricky and isn’t an exact science. Using the available settings, chop the fish so it is blended together and forms a ball. Run the appliance in bursts for 10-30 seconds. Once the fish is chopped, dump it into a mixing bowl.Be careful not to blend the fish for so long that it becomes a paste. A mixture with some chunks of fish is better than a mushy mixture of fish.
If your appliance has a blade that is designed for chopping, be sure to use it.

, Gefilte fish is spiced differently by different people, so it’s partly up to your personal taste. Salt and pepper are simple spices used in the dish. Grate some carrots, onions, or parsnip and mix them into the ground fish. Garlic powder is another common spice.Add three to five teaspoons (14.8-24.6 ml) of sugar for sweeter gefilte fish patties.
Add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of matzo meal for thicker patties.
Mix in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of finely grated lemon zest or 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of lemon juice.

, With clean, but still wet, hands, scoop some of the fish mixture out of the bowl. Make balls or oval patties that are about three inches (7.62 cm) long and one inch (2.54 cm) thick. The exact size and shape are up to you.It’s good to keep your hands wet so that the fish mixture doesn’t stick to your hands.
Make flat patties or more plump, sausage-like patties.

, Using your hands or a slotted spoon, gently slide the fish patties into the stock. If you use your hands, be careful not to burn yourself. Using a spoon reduces the risk of this happening.

, Put a tight-fitting lid on the pot and allow the patties to simmer. Stir the patties occasionally to make sure they don’t stick to the bottom. Cooking requires a minimum of about 10 minutes, but gefilte fish can be cooked for 25 or 30 minutes, as well.It’s also important to flip them once or twice to make sure both sides cook thoroughly.
If you have more patties than you can fit into the saucepan, either use a larger pan, cook the patties in two separate pans, or cook them in two batches.

, When you scoop the patties out of the stock, press a fork into them to make sure they feel firm. Set the cooked patties on a plate to cool. Serve them while they are hot or chill them for later.


Beet horseradish or dill-horseradish mayonnaise are common dipping sauces for gefilte fish.
Serve with sliced challah, a traditional bread eaten on Jewish holidays, or with a side of pickles.
Store leftovers in the fridge and eat within three to five days of preparation. Storing in the freezer extends the shelf life to about 3 months."

Create a Blarney Stone.,
Make a leprechaun hat that the students can wear during the day and then take home.",How to Choose St. Patrick's Day Crafts1," The Blarney Stone is located in Blarney Castle, where visitors can lean over the ramparts of the castle to kiss the stone and achieve the gift of eloquence, or a way with words. Have each child create their own Blarney Stone before they practice reading for the day.


Either collect enough smooth river rocks for your classroom or ask each student to bring one in. The rocks should be about the size of the palm of your hand. Wash the rocks with soap and water and set them out to dry for a day.
Give each child a paintbrush and some green paint. Ask them to paint their Blarney Stone green. Although the original Blarney Stone isn't green, green is meant to signal the ""luck of the Irish."" Allow the rocks to dry for 30 minutes, or perhaps during recess.
Ask the children to make a face on the smoothest portion of their rock, because they will need to kiss the Blarney Stone to get the gift of good speech. Pass out black markers, eyes, yarn, glue and any other supplies you have on hand to help the children get creative. Allow the glue to dry.
Tell each student to kiss their Blarney Stone, then take turns reading from a text, such as an Irish fable or a history of St. Patrick or Ireland.;
, Leprechauns are often associated with Irish luck, as a saying goes that a leprechaun's gold lies at the end of the rainbow, and if you can find it, you can keep it.


Print out a leprechaun hat template at enchantedlearning.com/crafts/stpatrick/Hattemplate.shtml. Print it out and then make a few practice hats so that you can approximate the size of hats that will fit your age group. You can also make it tiny, as if it was taken from a small leprechaun. Use a copier to help you enlarge the template if need be and then copy the hat template so that each child will have one. Print on green paper if you have the budget for it.
Ask the children to cut the shapes out of their leprechaun hat template. If it was printed on white paper, they may want to color it green with markers before cutting it out. Ask the children to cut tabs into the top of the rectangular piece. Then, ask them to fold right below where they cut.
Have the children cut bands of yellow paper to glue onto the rectangular piece, at the bottom. They can draw a buckle into the middle with brown, black or red markers. Have them glue it to the bottom of the rectangular piece.
The children should place glue along the left hand side and then form a cylinder and glue it to the other side of their rectangle. They should have a circle sitting on their desk.
Place glue on the small tabs on the top and place the smaller circle that they cut out from the template on the top. Make sure the glue sticks to the tabs. They can flip the hat over and press from the inside to be sure it stays.
Cut lines into the center of the large circle from the template. They should be in a star formation. Once the lines are cut, the children should be able to lift triangular pieces from the center. Ask them to place glue on all of these pieces.
Place the hat on the large rectangle. Ask the children to reach their hand through the bottom and stick the triangular pieces to the inside of the circle. They have just created the brim. Allow the hat to dry for 30 minutes to 1 hour before wearing.

, Traditionally, otoshidama were small gifts of appreciation given during New Year`s calling. In modern times, otoshidama is money given to children. The usual amount is around 5,000 yen and it should be enclosed in a special decorated envelop. Merchants might give you oseibo (a small present of their wares).

, The end of the year is the traditional time to clean and purify your house and office. This is called susuharai or ousouji.

, This tradition originated in the Tokyo area. The long noodles symbolize a long life.

, This is a popular Japanese singing contest between a red team and a white team. If you can`t watch Kōhaku Uta Gassen, consider listening to Beethoven`s Ninth Symphony. It is commonly associated with New Year`s in Japan.

, Wait in line to ring the bell and worship at the shrine. After that, you might chat with your friends or buy talismans from the miko (shrine maidens). You might want an omamori, hamaya, kamifuda, or ema. Listen to the gagaku (court music). At a Buddhist temple, you can watch their bell rung 108 times at midnight. If there is an aerial firework display, consider watching it.

, Common offerings are mochi, persimmons, chestnuts, pine seeds, black peas, sardines, herring roe, cuttlefish, and oranges.

, The New Year is considered a time for starting over.

, Some foods are considered lucky to eat around New Year`s. Many stores in Japan sell boxed meals including foods like kuri (chestnuts), datemaki (egg), kamaboko (fish cake), kobumaki (kelp), yakizakana (fish), kazunoko (herring roe), konnyaku (a vegetable), gobo (burdock), renkon (lotus root), kuromame (black beans), ise ebi (spiny lobster), and daikon (radish). Ozōni (mochi soup) and otoso (spiced sake) are also eaten during New Year`s.

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).,
Scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets and flatten it.,
Bake the cookies for 12 to 13 minutes.,
Allow the cookies to cool before serving them.",How to Make Green Chocolate Chip Cookies2," Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl. Add the baking powder, baking soda, and the salt. Stir them together, then add in the chocolate chips. Toss everything together gently.


This recipe requires a 12 to 24-hour chilling period. Plan ahead!

, Pour both the white and the brown sugars into another large mixing bow. Pour in the canola oil and the water. Whisk them together for about 2 minutes. You can speed up the process by using a handheld beater, a stand mixer, or a food processor fitted with whisks.


If you don't have canola oil, you can use another type of oil with a neutral flavor to it, such as grapeseed.
If the brown sugar has clumps in it, be sure to break them up first before adding it to the bowl.
If you can't find a vegan-friendly white sugar, use 1 cup (200 grams) of brown sugar instead of a combination of white and brown sugar., Keep stirring until the color and texture are consistent. If you don't have liquid food coloring, try 3 drops of gel food coloring instead.If you want the cookies to have a minty flavor, use 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract instead of the vanilla.You can use more food coloring if the color is not strong enough for you.

, You can do this with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, as needed, and stop when there is no flour left. Do not over-mix the batter.

, Cover the bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap, then stick it in the fridge. Leave it there for 12 to 24 hours. This is very important; if you skip this step, the cookies will spread out too much while baking.

, Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Do this when the dough is done chilling.

, Use a small ice cream scoop or a cookie scoop to form the dough into balls. Gently flatten each ball to a 2-inch (508-centimeter) wide disk.


Consider freezing the cookies for 10 minutes. This will help them keep their shape.

, They are ready when the edges turn golden. If your oven is not big enough to fit the baking sheets, you will need to put them on separate racks. If you end up doing this, be sure to switch the baking sheets around halfway through baking.

, Let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes first before transferring them to a wire cooling rack. Let them finish cooling (about 10 minutes) before serving them."

Go green.,
Accessorize.,
Learn some Irish words and phrases.,
Learn to Irish Dance.,
Learn a little of the history of St Patrick's Day.",How to Celebrate St. Patrick's Day1," Unless you want to, you don't have to wear a sweater with a giant shamrock on it. (Though that would certainly help you stand out.) The great thing about this holiday is you are free to go as subtle or as wild as you like. St. Patrick's Day t-shirts have been a common article of clothing to wear proudly. Consider the following suggestions when picking out something to wear:


An all green t-shirt with optional Irish-related sayings, for example, ""Kiss me, I'm Irish!"" Note that no real Irish person over the age of ten would be caught dead in one of these. T-shirts with Irish beer monikers such as Harp or Guinness are more acceptable
For those who are feeling particularly festive, try buying or making a leprechaun costume, replete with white stockings, green top hat and fake (or real!) red beard.
If you're working on March 17th, you can still get into the festive spirit by incorporating a little green into your work attire. Try a green-striped polo or collared shirt, a green or shamrock-dotted tie, or green socks and undies for the closet St.Paddy's Day fans.;
, Buttons, pins and jewelry are all great ways to dress up an outfit. On St. Patrick's Day, they become ways to express the fun side of fashion. Nothing is too gaudy or outlandish. Buttons with clever (or not so clever) sayings are also encouraged. Small shamrock pins are a great and subtle way to express your support of the holiday.


It is a tradition in Ireland for all attending parades and generally celebrating to wear a small collection of Shamrock fastened by a clothes pin to your top (in the same place as a badge would be worn).
Dying your hair or your pet's fur bright green is also a great way to stand out. Be sure to use a non-toxic dye.
It's also common to see kids (and sometimes adults) with their faces painted on St. Patrick's Day, particularly if they're attending the parade. Cute shamrocks on the cheeks are a popular option, along with full-faced Irish flags of green, white and orange.

, The Irish have their own distinct dialect of the English language, so if you want to sound like a true Paddy on St. Patrick's day, try sprinkling some of these Hiberno-English gems into your conversation:



What's the craic? This phrase can be interpreted as either ""How's it going?"" or ""What's going on?"" or ""What's up?"" and is used in non-formal settings. Craic is a very important word in Ireland and can be used to describe your enjoyment of an event or activity, e.g ""How was the party?"" ""Ah sure, it was great craic altogether!"" Use ""craic"" in the correct context and you'll earn major points with the Irish.

Grand. Grand is another multi-purpose word in Hiberno-English. It doesn't mean large or impressive, but rather translates as ""fine"" or ""great"" depending on the context. ""I'm grand"" is a perfectly acceptable reply to the question ""How are you?"" and means the person is doing just fine. If you ask an Irish person ""How did the exam go?"" and they reply ""It was grand"" that means it went okay, it wasn't amazing, but it wasn't a disaster either.

Eejit. Eejit is basically the Irish word for idiot. If someone does something silly or stupid, you can comment ""Ah ya big eejit!"" It's not meant to be offensive, rather it's used to make fun of someone in a playful way.

, Irish dancing is a form of step dancing which is popular both in Ireland and all over the world. Not only will it impress everyone you know, but it's also a fun way to increase flexibility and burn calories! You can learn how to Irish dance by attending classes in your local area or by copying some of the excellent Irish dancing videos and tutorials online. Whip out a few impressive steps and lifts the next time you hear a reel or a jig and nobody will question your Irish credentials.


Get some friends together and learn how to céili (kay-lee) dance - a form of Irish social dancing that can be done with as few as two and as many as sixteen people.
If you get good enough you can compete in the many feiseanna or Irish dancing competitions that take place all over the world. Even better, you can volunteer to perform in the next St. Patrick's Day parade!

, St. Patrick's Day has been observed as a religious festival in Ireland for over a thousand years, though it was only recognized as a celebration of Irish culture and heritage in the 1970s.The day is named in honor of St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, who has been credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland. There are multiple origin stories for St. Patrick, but:


Most sources agree that St. Patrick's actual name was Maewyn Succat. They also agree that Maewyn was kidnapped and sold into slavery at age 16 and, to help him endure his enslavement, he turned to God.Six years after his captivity began, St. Patrick escaped from slavery to France, where he became a priest, and then the second Bishop to Ireland. He spent the next 30 years establishing schools, churches, and monasteries across the country. He brought Christianity widespread acceptance amongst the pagan indigenous peoples.It is thought that St. Patrick used a shamrock as a metaphor for the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), showing how three individual units could be part of the same body. His parishioners began wearing shamrocks to his church services. Today, ""the wearing of the green"" on St. Patrick's Day represents spring, shamrocks, and Ireland."

Travel to Ireland.,
Eat traditional Irish food.,
Play some Irish music.,
Attend or get involved in local parades.,
Check out the pub scene.,
Consider having a party at home.",How to Celebrate St. Patrick's Day2," What better way to celebrate the quintessential Irish holiday than a trip to the land of Saints and Scholars! Dublin, the capital city, usually holds a five day festival in honor of the holiday and is the location of Ireland's largest and most impressive St. Patrick's Day parade. The city buzzes with life over the course of the festival - thousands of tourists flood the city and the pubs are overflowing with travelers and locals alike, eager to ""drown the shamrock"". So if you're looking to celebrate St. Patrick's Day in true Irish fashion, this is the place to be!


Alternatively, you can take a trip down the country to escape from the tourist-ridden streets of Dublin and experience a somewhat quieter, but more authentic version of the holiday. Most towns will have some semblance of a parade - the quality varying from decent to poor - but the real reason to go is for the vibrant pub-scene, where you can enjoy high-quality traditional and contemporary Irish music surrounded by an authentic Irish crowd!
As mentioned above, thousands of tourists flock to Ireland every March so it's advisable to book flights and accommodation well in advance, to avoid soaring prices and possible disappointment.

, Beer and spirits are not the only great consumable goods to come out of Ireland. Corned beef, cabbage and lamb stew accompanied by traditional Irish soda bread are tasty ways to ""keep it real."" Potatoes are about as Irish as you can get and are one of the staples of the Irish diet.


Traditional Irish foods include bangers and mash, colcannon, bacon (boiled ham) and cabbage, stew, boxty, Shepherd's Pie, potato bread and black pudding.
In Ireland, the day is usually celebrated by eating food such as pink bacon or savory roast chicken. Note that corned beef and cabbage is more of an Irish-American tradition than an authentically Irish one., Ireland has a long history with music, and many incredible styles have emerged. Celtic, folk and traditional Irish pub songs might just get you in the St. Patrick's Day spirit! You can play some Irish music at home, listen to it on the radio (some stations will have special St. Patrick's Day features) or find out about any Irish bands or musicians playing locally.


Find a compilation CD of traditional Irish songs or download some individual songs online. You should easily be able to find traditional Irish music by artists such as The Chieftains, The Dubliners, Planxty and Clannad, for example.
If traditional music isn't your thing, don't forget about the many contributions Irish musicians have made to the world of rock and pop. Think U2, Van Morrison, Thin Lizzy and The Cranberries.
Alternatively, you can try your hand at some traditional Irish instruments, such as the tin whistle, the bodhrán, the harp, the fiddle or the uilleann pipes. However, you're not likely to produce anything very melodic sounding if it's your first time!

, If you can't make it to the five day festival in Dublin, Ireland, check out the scene locally. Many parades feature the best of local dance troupes, marching bands, gymnasts and musicians in addition to spectacular themed floats and brightly costumed participants. You can enjoy the parade as a spectator or contact your local parade organization committee to get involved.


There are many ways to participate in your local parade. You can get dressed up and march in the parade yourself, help design costumes or floats or help out with the organization of the parade. St. Patrick's day is a festive, communal holiday - so get involved!
Though small towns aren't likely to have parades, many large cities such as New York City, Boston, St. Louis, San Francisco, Chicago, London, Montreal and Sydney have great celebrations.
Savannah, GA boasts the second largest parade in the United States, while out of any US state, Boston has the highest number of Irish descendants by percentage of population, and its South Boston St. Patrick's Day parade is the first recorded anywhere in the world., Most bars and pubs love St. Patrick's Day, as it's one of the few holidays known for a marked increase in alcohol consumption, so many will be catering to patrons with a festive St. Patrick's theme. You may find special prices on draft beer, food and cover charges. Call around to your favorite joints and ask if they have any celebration plans.


A pub crawl can be a great way to get some friends together and explore the local pub scene, especially if there are a lot of Irish bars in your area. Make a list of the pubs you want to visit in advance (if you are ambitious you could aim for 17 pubs in honor of March 17th!), then make a rule that everyone needs to have a pint in each pub you visit. 17 pints of Guinness anyone?
It would be a shame to drink Budweiser on St. Patrick's Day, regardless of where in the world you are. If Guinness isn't your thing, try a pint of Bulmers (also called Magners) cider, Smithwick's ale, Jameson Irish whiskey or some Bailey's Irish cream. Whatever you drink, avoid any green beer.

, If you aren't a fan of the bar scene but still want to celebrate, invite a few friends over and have a St. Patrick's Day themed party. Go as extreme or as laid back as you want: insist that everyone wear green or just have them come as they are and chill out with a few beers.


Consider starting a tradition, such as watching a movie, ""The Quiet Man"" with John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara is a fun choice; serve corned beef and cabbage or Irish stew with colcannon (mashed potatoes and cabbage).

Make green beer and green chocolate chip cookies for your party.
In Ireland it is common to get together with family for St. Patrick's Day, so perhaps you'd like to do this too.

Put away the holiday decorations in a timely manner.,
Look over your New Year's Resolution list.,
Focus on organization.,
Relax more.,
Clean your work or study space.,
Reflect over the past year.",How to Start the New Year Fresh," When the holiday festivities are over, the decorations, ornaments and other festive trappings can be popped back into their boxes and bags. If you leave this too long, it can feel like a chore and can also have the effect of holding you back from moving into the next experiences. Don't feel like you have to get rid of it all in one day. Remove things little by little, ideally between Christmas and New Year's.


Ask family and friends to help tidy away the seasonal decorations to make it easier.;
, (If you haven't made one, skip this step.) Write the list out on a planner, chart or calendar where you can make notes. In order to get your resolutions underway, it's probable that you'll need to do some planning and organizing, and perhaps even some purchasing. It helps your focus to make notes and lists to direct your efforts in starting new habits. For example:


Is there any gear, equipment, food, clothing, etc. needed to start your new fitness/eating/exercise regime? Or perhaps you need new hobby or craft materials or new sports gear. Write down the needed items so that you can work out whether you already have what's needed or need to buy, beg, borrow or freecycle it.
Do you need to book memberships, travel, subscriptions or any other service to aid the resolution? If so, write this down too.
Write down anything else of relevance, alongside those resolutions.
In some cases, breaking down the goals into short term and long term milestones is necessary to ensure you don't flag in your willpower. Write down any milestones you think will work for you.

, If you're already wonderfully organized, skip this step. But many people aren't and this can inhibit feeling like the new year is a fresh start.


Are there piles of papers and books on the desk and floor? Clean them up in short bursts here and there (stealth cleaning!).
Do you have trouble finding things, from keys to socks? Look for simple solutions, such as hanging up a key holder and setting up a special lost sock basket. One method is about training, the other is about acceptance––for example, you can train yourself to put things away but you can't account for missing socks until the mate turns up, so have a safe-keeping zone for such items.
Hate cleaning? You could try to convince yourself it's exercise, a moment of Zen or a chance to throw out your mate's junk but it's better to find help. Delegate the cleaning jobs to others as much as possible and try to arrange it so that you're doing what you're best at. It's overwhelming to be the person responsible for it all, so stop trying.
Take de-cluttering in gradual steps. Perhaps, first sort through your desk on Monday, organize your closet on Tuesday and Wednesday, go through your bookshelf on Thursday, vacuum on Friday, dust on Saturday, and organize whatever else needs to be organized on Sunday. Once you've organized specific high-use areas, you will realize it's much easier to concentrate and find what you need with a clean room.

, If you're not in the habit of relaxing, start the new year with a resolution to add this important activity (or lack of activity) to your life from now on.


Spend a little time browsing through books and websites devoted to relaxation ideas. What sorts of relaxing opportunities appeal to you? Not everyone agrees that the same things are relaxing––some people find adrenaline-packed activities relaxing while others would rather slump in the hammock with a good book. It's your choice, just so long as it relaxes you.
Almost everyone finds spa-style activities relaxing. This might mean a weekly bath by candlelight with big bubbles (and maybe some bubbly), a massage (at home with a loved one or paid for at a spa), yoga, meditation and the like.
When you get a chance, take a relaxation break on Saturday or some other appropriate free day or afternoon. Get your rest, have some friends over for a spa party if you want, or just be alone. You can give yourself an oil treatment, manicure/pedicure, and whatever else will make you feel good and look good.

, Going back to work or college/school after the holiday break can leave you feeling a little out of sorts. Tidying up your desk, locker, backpack, or whatever else you have where stuff accumulates can help you to feel refreshed for the new year. Throw out last year's junk, file away important information where it belongs and give everything a good dust or wipe down. Refill anything that you're running out of and if you can, place a pretty plant or photo on your desk to cheer yourself up.


For backpacks, satchels, handbags, laptop carriers and other bags: Don't carry around unnecessary items! Things you don't need in the bag are clutter that increases the bulk and weight and might scratch items like laptops, phones and valuables.

, Think about things you'd like to do better this year, new things you'd like to try to people you'd like to make amends with or start over with. Have you achieved the things you wanted to in the past year? What specific things would you like to change or redirect? Asking yourself questions about progress, change and where you want to be right now can help to keep your perspective fresh, giving you new motivation to make this year a more fulfilling one.


Anything you regret saying? Anyone you wish you could apologize to? If there are people that you owe an apology to, apologize and make things right with them. You don't want to worry or regret anything when you start the new year.
Was this past year so great you don't want it to be a new year? Great, make a scrapbook or diary entry about how great this year has been. But tell yourself the new year will be even better. Build on the lessons you've learned and keep the good things coming.
Was this past year such a terrible year for you, that you worry the new year will be more of the same or even worse? Thinking that way may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Nobody expects you to fly when your wings feel broken, but it's important for your own well-being to start finding small ways to mend your dreams. Treat yourself with greater compassion and hang out more with folks who have kind hearts. Focus on making this coming year a much gentler, kinder one. This might include letting go of things that are causing you anxiety––scary at first, but really liberating when you finally do it.

If anyone offers you a drink, politely turn them down. You can still have fun without drinking. Enjoy virgin/non-alcoholic drinks instead.;
, If you're going out with some friends, make sure that one of you is the designated driver and stays sober the entire night. Make a deal with your friends to switch the designated driver role every year or after every party you attend to keep things fair.

, That way you can have some drinks and walk home afterwards. You're staying off the roads and keeping others safe.

, Take the bus, the subway, etc. home instead of driving.


Do some research on free transit in your city. If you live downtown or in a metropolitan area, some cities offer free public transit on New Year's Eve.

, If you and your friends are planning on drinking, call a cab and split the cost between everyone. Doing this will ensure that everyone gets home safely.

, For example, if you live in the USA, depending on your state & city, AAA might be able to give you a free ride home, or even drive you in your own car, regardless of if you're an AAA member. Check here for a list of safe ride programs across the country. Program their phone numbers into your phone ahead of time.


Another example would be Operation Red Nose, stationed in British Columbia, Canada, who will drive you home in your car for free.

Pick out dinner food that everyone enjoys but you don’t get a chance to have very often, like steak, chili, or lobster.This family meal can turn into a New Year’s Eve tradition.


You could also consider making a meal out of appetizers.This could lead to a more casual dinner setup, and the kids will like having the ability to pick and choose different kinds of food.Cheese fondue is another fun dinner idea for New Year’s Eve.Eating cheese fondue with bits of bread and meats will require everyone to sit and eat together.

During this time you can eat and drink different snacks that you have prepared for the night.You can also use this time to watch old home videos and reminisce on good times.Depending on how many home videos you have, you can make it a dinner time activity, or have them playing throughout the night.

, Arrange an area of your home to be the photo booth stage.

Write your resolutions.,
Organize for the coming year.,
Finish projects you’ve been avoiding.",How to Celebrate New Years Alone3," New Year’s is a wonderful time to take on new challenges and goals. However, over 90 percent of people don’t stick to them. For more success, experts say sharing your goals with friends and family as well as carving out time for progress are key. Try deciding on your biggest goal and sharing it on social media accounts. This will increase your level of commitment and accountability.


Writing effective resolutions can be difficult, so allow yourself ample time to reflect on what changes you want to make.
If writing personal goals doesn't sound appealing, some people write resolutions for specific areas of their lives. For example, there are a lot of common home-improvement resolutions people make that still have a large impact on their lives., There are some tasks that make the year go smoothly if we take the time to complete them early on. Filling out calendars and planners with important dates, creating new budgets, and buying birthday and holiday cards to have on hand are tasks that are easy to complete and will make the coming year much more efficient.

, This is a great time to focus on tasks that require a lot of time and attention, considering a lot of people will not be around to distract you. Sifting through paperwork, home improvement projects, and even returning to abandoned hobbies are great strategies for feeling very productive and successful before the start of a new year. This can also make room in your schedule and to-do list for any new resolutions or hobbies you’re planning to commit to.

Realize that New Year's day is just another day and that making resolutions on this day is no different from making a resolution on any other day.,
Pinpoint your most realistic resolutions.,
Write down your resolutions.,
Focus on one change at a time.,
Use positive language rather than negative demands when thinking about doing your resolution.,
Make the change a gradual one.,
Get some support.,
Review your progress.,
Build on your resolutions.,
Celebrate.",How to Stick to a New Year's Resolution," While it's a convenient time because it's a new year and therefore feels like a new beginning, placing too much emphasis on it being a brand new start of the day your whole life is going to change is unrealistic. Think of the occasion more as a catalyst for change and a jumping-off point.;
, Review the different areas in your life and think about what is working as well as what isn't. Instead of picking the same old resolutions that you can never seem to keep, like losing weight, giving up smoking or winning an award, choose an area that you know needs improvement rather than a radical change. Think long term and make sure it's something you can realistically see happening. And reduce the amount of resolutions you make – hone down that list of 10 resolutions to just one or two, or be prepared to approach your resolutions one after another rather than all at once.


For instance, perhaps you don't see enough of your friends or you never ring your mum. Working on these seemingly simple things may be more rewarding in the long run.

Longer term goals such as learning a new language or controlling your temper are also fine but they must be broken down into chunks so that you don't have unrealistic expectations and then give up too easily.

, Once you have decided on your achievable resolutions, write them down. You could even make a contract with yourself stating what you will set out to do and sign it to make it official. Writing down the resolutions creates a greater connection between your thinking self and your doing self and makes the resolution appear more real than if you simply think it in your head.

, Rather than trying to have several large changes underway at once, such as trying to lose weight, quit smoking, and increase your exercise regime, break the changes down into smaller lots and focus on one single resolution at a time. Your focus and energies won't be spread too thinly this way and you can give the single resolution all of your attention.


Break down each change into smaller steps and make the first step incredibly easy. For example, if you want to start flossing, the first step can be to locate the floss in the supermarket.
Find routine trigger points during your day for implementing your resolution. For example, when you're eating a meal, brushing your teeth, putting out the pets, etc. Choose times that provide natural triggers for doing whatever it is your resolution is about an tack the resolution behavior onto the existing habit.

, For example, rather than thinking ""I can't be bothered going to the gym"", think ""I always feel so much better for going to the gym and I love that feeling."" Highlighting the benefit to you is far more motivating than focusing on the negatives and self-deprecation for not doing it as expected.

, A resolution is unlikely to be enduring if you implement it in its totality the first day. Giving up your favorite daily treats cold turkey will probably cause you to think about them endlessly and finally give in to resuming eating them. Instead, slowly wean yourself off the treats by eating less of them each week, until you are no longer including them in your daily eating regime.


Give yourself plenty of time to make the change. At least 21 days of pursuing a new habit are needed to break the old habit, and a good period of time to set a new resolution in place is around two months, after which time it should feel much easier to meet your resolution.

, Tell a friend or your loved ones whom you trust about your resolution. They will provide you with support and keep you focused on your goal. And if you are wavering at all, their support will ensure you don't give up, just in case you feel like a quitter.


Consider joining an online support group for specific resolutions such as losing weight, giving up chocolate, or training for the next marathon. Having people you can talk to at any time of day or night can be an enormous source of instant support, especially if the people are going through the same experiences and concerns as you. In turn, be sure to help boost other people's resolutions!

, Break your resolution down into stages so you can track your progress. Look back after a couple of months and see what you're doing right. Try to fix anything that you're doing wrong. For instance, if your resolution was to go to the gym three evenings a week, perhaps you haven't been sticking to it because you always work late. Try going in the mornings instead. Making a minor adjustment could be the key to success.

, When you're doing well at keeping your resolution, you may discover that you are feeling better about other areas of your life too. Going to the gym may lead you to cut out smoking too. Similarly, if you have given up something as part of your resolution, try to find a pleasant and diversionary substitute to keep your mind occupied. Quitting smoking may encourage you to exercise more.

, Remember to celebrate your successes, but make sure the way you celebrate doesn't go against your resolution. If you cut down on drinking alcohol, clearly it's best not to reward yourself with a glass of wine. Instead, treat yourself to those shoes you've had your eye on, or tickets to a play you've been dying to see. You deserve it!


Keep going. Why stop now when you've done this well? Extend the timeline of your resolution and work it into your everyday routine. By next year, you'll be more than ready to face your next challenge.

Wear warm clothing.,
Arrive early.,
Make this clear to yourself - there are no portable bathrooms in Times Square.,
If you're looking for a view of the entertainers who will be performing in Times Square, make sure you find a spot near any of the stages assembled throughout the Square.,
When the countdown reaches the final ten seconds, chant the numbers with the hundreds of thousands of fellow revelers in Times Square.,
Leave as soon as you can after the ball drops.",How to Attend the New Year's Celebrations in Times Square," Wear a warm jacket, scarf, mittens, etc. if you're going to wait to see the ball drop. Winter temperatures in New York City can get downright chilly and brisk, especially during New Year's Eve, so make sure to bundle up unless you want to stand outside for many long hours in the freezing air.


Be sure to wear adequate footwear and socks too. Cold feet can make the occasion miserable.;
, Early can mean anytime between 1pm-5pm of the afternoon leading into New Year's Eve. While this sounds very early, it's essential if you want to guarantee yourself a nice view of the ball and the entertainment stages. If you arrive later, you risk receiving a crummy, crowded spot with no view, or, in the worst case, you won't be permitted into Times Square at all.


Take along things to do while you wait, like crossword puzzles, phone games, some reading you'd like to catch up on.
Go with someone. It might be a good idea to bring along an equally stalwart family member or close friend to Times Square. Although you may be able to chat with the revelers around you, you might want to pass the time talking to someone you know well instead.
It is possible to purchase guided tours at steep prices and have people shepherd you through the crowd (some tours also provide a dinner, etc.) This might prove easier for you if you have the cash and less desire to be standing about for hours. Search online for details.

, Unless you want to hold it in for eight hours, try not to drink excessive amounts of liquids before or while you wait in Times Square.

, If you're lucky enough to grab a spot right beside the stage, chances are you'll be able to shake hands or even talk with the entertainers after their performances.


Don't be upset if you have a crummy view of the ball drop or entertainers in Times Square. Huge video screens are set up throughout the area that display live coverage of the event, as well as the sixty-second countdown, for revelers who haven't made it to the center of the action.

, And at midnight, cheer as loud as you can, kiss your spouse or date, and enjoy the post-ball drop music.

, Otherwise you risk facing a very difficult and frustrating time getting out of Times Square in any hurry. Millions of people will be either returning home or to their hotels, and you can expect long lines and wait times.

Expect some letdown.,
Choose to see the benefits of post-holiday time.,
Be gentle on yourself with respect to your New Year's Resolutions.,
Continue spending time around people.,
Do things that give you cause to look forward to something.,
Make healthy choices.,
Make this a time for getting professional help and turning around things that have been bothering you.,
Expect to enjoy the year ahead.",How to Cope With Post Holiday Syndrome," The holiday season is both joyful and stressful at once. There is family to get along with, gifts to buy and return, people to visit, activities to throw yourself into, plenty of festive food to eat, sales to rush to, and parties to plan and attend. Topped off with the excitement of New Year's Eve, your adrenaline has probably been pumping a lot of the time during the Christmas and New Year's period. Returning to the usual routine and probably quieter workplace than normal can dampen your spirits just by the absence of exciting things to do and look forward to. Equally, if your Christmas and New Year's Eve period wasn't as enjoyable as you had hoped, you can be left feeling down about the lack of enjoyment you'd expected and this can sour your mood. Expecting to feel a little low is a way of telling yourself that this is a normal feeling and that it will soon pass once the routine re-establishes itself.


Look at your past experiences to enlighten you as to your normal post-holiday feelings. Do you always fall into a slump after the holiday season? If you have spent period after last two holidays in despair, then the chances of this post holiday period continuing in despair are high. Look carefully about what you did last time and what relaxed you. And realize that generally this is a phase that is easily fixed.;
, The good side to the end of the holidays is that you've had a chance to rest, to relax, and to enjoy yourself. The craziness prior to Christmas has ended both at the workplace and in the home, and the restful time after Christmas and New Year's Eve has hopefully given you the opportunity to do things that are different from your usual routine. And any break in the routine is good for the spirit, providing you with the chance to rejuvenate.


Take it easy when you're settling back down into your usual routine. Your more rested self is a good thing and gives you an opportunity to take a renewed perspective on your work, routine, study, or home life pace.
Perhaps the break has given you perspective on your life, job, relationships etc. If so, this is a good time to consider making changes to improve your situation, especially because not making the changes can prolong your blues.

, If you set the bar too high and you already feel as if you're slipping, don't berate yourself. Instead, look at your resolutions realistically and assess whether they need some tweaking to ensure that they're achievable. Discard the resolutions that required you to be too harsh on yourself and reform them into ones that can be met now that the heady atmosphere of New Year's Eve is behind you. Think of it as a double checking of the details, and simply fiddle with the fine print!


Ensure that any goals you've set are reasonable and most importantly achievable. Taking weight loss as an example, targeting for a size zero is unrealistic, but looking for 1 pound loss in a span of week seems to be more achievable.

, Some of the post-holiday season blues might be related to having been around many people over the Christmas break and then suddenly finding yourself surrounded by people you don't know that well, or even not by many people at all. Lift your spirits by continuing to stay connected with friends and family, and getting out and about to do activities where other people interact with you.

, Revive the excitement of anticipation by arranging fun activities, such as having dinner with friends, starting a new class for a hobby or interest, attending a sporting event regularly, going to the movies, etc. Choose activities that meet your budget and interests, and that you know will give you a thrill.

, After the many indulgences over the holiday period, it can leave you feeling a little out of shape and worse for wear in the nutrition department. Aim to return to eating healthy food, drinking healthy drinks, and ensuring that you keep getting a good amount of exercise. Eating well and keeping up regular exercise will enhance your mood and help you return to good shape and fitness levels. If you're worried about not keeping warm enough during the colder weather, have more healthy chunky, warming soups that will both warm and fill you up without carrying lots of calories. Warm salads are also an excellent choice during winter.


Eat away your blues. Eat foods that boost your serotonin (feel good) neurotransmitters. Suitable foods containing tryptophan (the building block for serotonin) include bananas, poultry, dairy produce, and peas.Keep exercising no matter the weather, lethargy and weight excuses. Exercise will give you the mood-boost you need and gets you moving again. If you're living in a cold climate, there are plenty of winter exercising options such as walking, skiing, and gym workouts. You could also stay inside and exercise on an indoor exercise bike if you have one. For those in a hot climate, swimming, hiking, and water sports are ideal mood lifters.

, The holiday season tends to put a hold on pressing issues at work and in your personal life because the celebrations, meet-ups, and preparations require your foremost attention. Once this busyness dies down, you're returned to thinking about your general life issues and this might just be a good time to get help from the professionals, be it for anything from sorting out your finances, redecorating your home, or dealing with the unhappy feelings you're experiencing.


If you didn't plan too well for the holidays and find yourself deep down in the debt rack, get financial advice immediately and start to sort out the finances sooner rather than later. It might reduce the indulgences for now but this is probably the best time to feel the least deprived about indulgences!

, Trying to keep a positive frame of mind and planning for interesting and fulfilling events throughout the year is a good way to calm your current blues. Think ahead to the changing seasons and the sorts of things you'd like to be doing as the year moves on, and the sorts of activities and events you'd like to be a part of. Doing something about the things you'd like to happen is the first step and once you're immersed in planning and doing, you'll be too busy to fret.


If you want to travel, start planning the trip and budget now.
If you've got big plans ahead like your own or someone else's wedding, having a baby, renovating a home, taking your parents on a cruise, etc., throw yourself into planning.
If you're yearning for certain aspects of your life to change, such as going from being single to being part of a couple, use this time to plan how you will make this happen, such as putting yourself out there more, joining a club, or spending time using specific online sites, etc.

Remember Thanksgiving Day is just one day!",How to Avoid Gaining Weight over Thanksgiving," The great thing about the holidays is you know exactly when they're coming. They're not like that surprise pot of queso your friend brought over that one night that you accidentally devoured all by yourself after a regrettable bottle and a half of wine. So do your worries a favor and cut back the week before. It'll make the food on Turkey Day that much more delicious!


We're not advocating dieting, per se. What we are saying is skip the dessert, don't spent the afternoon baking, or let your froyo coupon expire. When you go out for a meal, box up half before you even begin. Make little strides you wouldn't otherwise make. Thanksgiving isn't about losing weight -- it's about not gaining it.;
, When our kitchens, dining rooms, living rooms, and, let's be honest, bedrooms are littered with cakes, cookies, and sweet, sweet munchies, it'd take a robot or a lonely paraplegic not to succumb to the deliciousness. When peppermint brownies, gingerbread, and toffee is within arm's reach, no one is going to blame you for going over to the dark side. Since it'd be ridiculous to suggest you throw them out, the best thing you can do is to put them in a non-transparent container and in the cupboard. Out of sight, out of mind. It actually works!


When we're staring at a table full of treats, all hope goes out the window. But when they're there but not seen, we're capable of forgetting that they're there (most of the time) and thus can avoid the absent-minded munchie grab. Do yourself a favor and pack 'em away before you don't realize you're on your fifth mint chocolate cupcake.

, When our schedules get jam packed (which normally happens during the holidays), exercise is usually the first to go. The gym changes hours, we end up traveling, family obligations magnify tenfold -- whatever the cause, we succumb to the demands of our schedules and end up doing a lot more sitting, waiting, and eating than we intended. Instead of letting your schedule rule you, rule it.


Call up your gym and find out their new hours. Wake up 30 minutes earlier to squeeze in a 20-minute morning workout. Only do your holiday shopping after you've had a session with the treadmill. When you make it a priority, it's a lot easier to stick to.

, Most of us are running around like chickens with our heads cut off this time of year. The increase in our stress levels actually leads to more cortisol being produced, which can lead to weight gain.And you thought it was only the dinner rolls!


Take some time to do some warm-ups and stretching in the morning or squeeze in a yoga session whenever possible. Take 10 minutes of me-time when you're sitting at your desk at work. Whatever would give you that zen, do it. Your waistline won't know to thank you, but the numbers will (or won't!) prove it later.

, So maybe scheduling workouts is putting the cart before the horse. In order to schedule workouts you have to have workouts in the first place. What could you feasibly start doing? Any is better than none!


If you're traveling, what workouts can you do just by yourself? Core workouts (jumping jacks, planks, squats, etc.) can be done in your hotel room/boyfriend's uncle's spare bedroom.
Do it with family! Start a routine of taking an early evening walk, weather permitting. Even running around the house can get everyone going.
Sign up for a Turkey Trot! Your area may have a 5K, 10K, or Fun Run available on the morning of Thanksgiving. And proceeds may even go to charity! What a great way to start off giving thanks right away (and the right way).

, When our bodies get cold, all we want to do is huddle up in the corner under a blanket, rocking ourselves until the freeze passes. Maybe grabbing a hot toddy or two. To avoid this physical stagnation, keep warm! Turn the heat up in the house, throw on an extra sweater, but above all -- keep moving. And you know what moving does? Burns calories!


When our muscles stay warm and relaxed, it's a lot easier to opt for that workout. So run around your house a bit every so often. That evening workout may not seem so totally not doable anymore.

, You'll be in charge of the menu, and can plan from the start what foods will be on the table. Just be sure to ask if any of your guests have dietary restrictions! It can also be potluck style, that way you have a few options that you've pre-approved yourself.


Don't forget the table! If you didn't already know, wikiHow has tons of Thanksgiving articles to get you through your hosting duties.

, Pick natural, unprocessed foods, prepared simply but tastily with herbs, spices, and fruits, such as lemon and orange. Throw out the canned cranberries and go fresh. Instead of overloading on carb-heavy stuffing soaked in turkey juices, opt for a nutty quinoa. Bacon wrapped green beans? They're just as tasty steamed with olive oil, salt, and pepper!


There are many websites and online recipe sites that give detailed ""clean eating"" menus and recipes. Thanksgiving is a huge trend and so is health -- you have a veritable goldmine of information at your fingertips.

, When recipes call for eggs, butter, oil, and sugar (just for starters), you have a little wiggle room. Apart from the obvious (like switching sugar for Splenda, etc.), you can substitute yogurt, banana, or applesauce for your eggs or oil or to add body to dips and sauces.


To get started, take a look at wikiHow's How to Cook with Sugar Substitutes, How To Replace Eggs in Your Cooking, or How to Use Applesauce to Bake articles. And, yes -- it will still taste good!

, Gram for gram, veggies pack a lot fewer calories than meats or carbs. If you want to fill up your plate, these are the things you should be gorging on (if they're prepared correctly!) Have a plethora of veggie options at your table -- that way you'll have less room for dinner rolls!


For your mashed potatoes, make 25% of it cauliflower. Don't tell anyone and see if they even notice!
Stick to healthier oils like olive, canola or walnut. If you're seasoning your veggies, try to lay off the salt; it's the culprit behind bloating.

, Even though we're fully aware of Thanksgiving being the absolute biggest meal of the year (save maybe Christmas), that doesn't keep us from snacking the day away as we wait for the Turkey to bing in the oven. Instead of munching on cakes and cookies, opt for a veggie tray, fruits, and light cheeses. Since the cookies are in the cupboard (right?), you won't be tempted to go for them anyway!


Of course, if you can stay away from the finger foods entirely, that's best. But c'mon, this is Thanksgiving we're talking about here. Will-power and self-control is for holiday grinches.

, Sure, pumpkin pie is a given. Luckily, it's a lot healthier than pecan pie. And if you don't eat the crust, it's even better. But that doesn't have to be your only option. Stuffed apples or pears -- really any fruit without a crust -- is a great holiday dessert too and much lighter in calories. Take this day as an excuse to widen your dessert repertoire.


Never checked out wikiHow's Desserts and Sweets section? There are gems like How to Create Healthy Desserts for Your Family, How to Make Parfaits, How to Make Butterbeer, and even How to Make Caramel Coated Cheetos, Make Edible Gllitter, and How to Make Desserts with Ramen Noodles. Think of all the desserts you've never tried!

, Urge that schedule if you can influence the time set for the meal. That way, no appetizers are needed at all as you are sitting down to eat early. Also, the earlier start time gives you time for digestion (key to feeling good the next day) and for more activity in your day after the meal is finished. If you are active after the meal, it will help you manage physically and feel much better.


Grandma was right, have the beautiful meal on the table at 1 or 2 -- it works better for the cook/tablesetter/clean up persons as well -- then you aren't too exhausted to enjoy yourself! And you definitely need time before dessert. Which you want to savor and not force down, by the way.

, You basically have two options here: 1) Eat a decent, protein-rich breakfast followed by a large Thanksgiving meal, or 2)Skip breakfast, start starving, and eat a Thanksgiving meal that's so large you resort to rolling yourself to the couch and asking mom to bring you more pie because you can't move. Which one sounds like the more weight-friendly option?


Hopefully you're thinking #1. It's not exactly rocket science -- going into a meal not starving makes us eat a lot less when we hit the dinner table. Sure, you're wasting calories on food you eat every day, but you're preventing yourself from gorging on a 3,500 calorie meal. And no, it won't result in a higher calorie intake. You will eat less if you eat breakfast.

, If you did get lucky enough to secure hosting duties, good for you! Now you can run around entertaining people, filling up their drinks, making sure all is good to go, and decorating. Sounds like work, sure, but it'll keep you moving around. If fidgeters are thinner, this is definitely an idea worth taking advantage of.Don't think of this as ruining your Thanksgiving. No, no, no -- you're actually more involved. At the end of the day, you'll feel more like you created it, rather than being a passive participant. And maybe your friends and family will be thankful for you this year! Imagine that.

, This one barely needs reiteration. If your pants are so tight eating is uncomfortable, you'll do a lot less of it. At the very least you'll be conscious of what's going on in your body and feel less free to begin your self-induced food coma!

, Take tablespoon-size servings of only the various dishes you really want. Leave behind anything you feel lukewarm about! Take bites of what you like the very best, first. When you clear your small plate, you'll know exactly what you want to zero in on for seconds. It's all about tactical planning!


You can eat anything if you only eat a small amount. So don't tell yourself certain foods are off-limits. That just paves the way for intense cravings and falling off the wagon later. Eat a little bit to satisfy your hunger.

, When it comes to the big bird, it should be baked or roasted -- definitely not fried. If you can push for either of those two options, do so. And when it hits the table, opt for white meat that is without skin. The skin is the fattiest bit.


If your family is big into gravy made with drippings, chill it first for about 15 minutes. That will separate the fat, leaving a film on the top that you can scrape off. If anyone asks, tell them you read the Pilgrims did it and are trying to be authentic.

, That alcohol you're drinking -- be it eggnog (God forbid), Manhattans, or red wine is full of empty calories. You can drink and drink and drink and your body has no idea it's ingesting calories because it just isn't full. Go with water, club soda with lime, or a cup of mint tea! You will feel so much better, be more present, and survive the season with less weight left on your booty and more tread left on your tires.


If you do imbibe, try alternating each alcoholic drink with a ""hydration cycle"" of some kind - water with lemon, diet soda, Perrier, etc. Or take that glass of wine and turn it into a spritzer with bubbly, 0-calorie water. You want to remember the day, right?

, Enjoy and be thankful for each bite, truly savoring the wonderful tastes. The slower you eat, the less you'll intake before your stomach reaches your brain and says, ""Woah! Stop. I'm full!"" It usually takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to start sending CCK signals to your brain -- the ""I'm full"" hormone. So instead of gorging yourself before you realize you don't want any more, take it easy. You have the whole afternoon, after all!


A simple way to do this is to put your fork down between bites. Chewing your food a little more than you normally would (no need for counting and ruining Thanksgiving with math) and losing the fork are two concrete ways to curb your chowing speed.

, You're allowed to roast a turkey or turkey breast, make a pumpkin pie, or recreate Aunt Sue's special stuffing in July, if you want to! Ditch the ""one time only"" availability theory, which causes gobbling of Thanksgiving foods. This mindset and focus will make turning down extra Holiday servings a lot easier.


The food is not the key thing to Thanksgiving (otherwise it'd be called Food eating), and the food is not going to run away! There will be leftovers for later, or tomorrow. Sit back and visit, or be the person to initiate a ""What I am thankful for this year"" conversation. Keep your focus, eat what you really enjoy, and then stop.

, Find an activity outlet afterward. Crank up 70's disco hits and dance while helping clean up the meal and kitchen. Take a long walk with family and friends to enjoy town and/or enjoy the fall color. Play tag outside with the kids. You get the idea! Just get moving afterward.


You totally won't want to. However, your evolved self can say, ""NO!"" to those tryptophan receptors and push through it. Frisbee in the park, anyone?

, If you blow it, get right back up on the horse and ride. It's making excuses and rationalizations every single day afterward in the 40+ days between Thanksgiving and New Year's that will cause you to gain the typical 3-7 Holiday pounds. With the right mindset, your New Year's resolution can be something actually useful and unique!


Above all, do not let yourself just say ""what the heck, it's Thanksgiving (or December, Christmas, or New Year's)!"" and run wild. Holiday foods can be made anytime of year; don't be caught up in how special they are. Be picky and really enjoy what you decide to eat!

Choose a length that works for you.,
Pick an interesting neckline.,
Try a one-shoulder dress.,
Go backless.,
Keep your legs warm.,
Wrap it up.",How to Dress on New Year's Eve (for Women)1," Short skirts are relatively standard for New Year's Eve, but if you feel uncomfortable baring that much skin, stick with a skirt that falls at or just above the knee. Choose a length that makes you look and feel your best, regardless of tradition.;
, Instead of a straight-cut neckline, consider something a little more flirtatious, like a crisscross strap or strapless sweetheart neckline. For a more conservative option, try a festive scoop neck that keeps your shoulders covered but exposes part of your collarbone.

, One-shoulder dresses create a dramatic flair that works perfectly for a New Year’s Eve party. Moreover, playing peek-a-boo with your shoulders can often look sultrier than keeping both shoulders bare.

, If you feel a little wary about exposing your shoulders or chest, but you have a toned back with fairly clear skin, a daring backless dress might be the perfect option for you. A conservative front keeps things looking classy, while the exposed back shows a tempting glimpse of skin.

, Considering the chilly time of year, you may want to reconsider leaving your legs exposed. Simple skin-tone nylon pantyhose will do the trick, but if you want to make more of a statement, consider a black or patterned nylon, instead.

, Depending on how much skin your dress shows, your shoulders or back may end up feeling cold. Carry a wrap or shawl for when you have to venture outside. Alternatively, a capelet or cape provides you with a little more coverage while giving your look a dramatic twist.

Try on a sequined dress.,
Tone it down with a sequined skirt.,
Consider a sequined top.,
Look at lush velvet.,
Stick with your trusty little black dress.,
Try on a metallic jean.,
Keep things muted with a simple pattern.,
Make your accessories shimmer.,
Add some costume jewelry speckled with colored gems.,
Choose a centerpiece accessory.,
Carry a glittery clutch.",How to Dress on New Year's Eve (for Women)2," For most people, there are not many occasions when you can get away with wearing a sequined dress. On New Year's Eve, however, sequins are not only welcome, but classic.

, If a sequined dress is too much sparkle for your style, opt for a sequined skirt instead. Match the skirt with a simple fitted tank top or blouse. A solid black top offers an especially nice contrast with your shimmery skirt.

, If you would prefer to take the attention off your legs, draw it higher by wearing a fitted sequined top. Match it with a subdued bottom, like a black pencil skirt or dress trousers.

, Velvet is a luxurious material and makes an excellent alternative to sequins for dinner parties and other classy festivities. Make the most of this look by choosing an alluring hue, like turquoise, rather than a drab black.

, When all else fails, your little black dress can come to your rescue. It makes the perfect basic background for you to dress up with glitzy jewelry and sparkly shoes.

, If you plan on attending a casual party or ringing in the New Year with a small group of close friends, keep things simple by wearing a metallic jean. Metallic jeans have a tint of gold or silver overlaying the denim, making them a little dressier than your everyday jeans.

, If you are keeping things casual this New Year’s Eve, a fitted tank top or blouse with a simple yet festive pattern might be all you need. Prints themed to the occasion include stars and fireworks. Match it with a metallic jean if you want to add a little shimmer.

, Diamonds and similarly sparkly stones add class and glitz to your ensemble. A little can go a long way. Try a pair of simple diamond posts or a pendant with a diamond charm.

, Chunky colored gemstones can add a little bit of festive flair to your outfit. Look for a thick bangle bracelet covered in gems or a long beaded necklace.

, You can get away with some large, flashy jewelry for the occasion, but there is still such a thing as ""too much of a good thing."" Instead of wearing several large pieces of jewelry, find one piece that can take center stage—like extravagant chandelier earrings or an ornate necklace—and keep the rest of you jewelry, if you wear any, simple and subdued.

, The clutch is the classic party purse. Look for one with a solid gold or silver shimmer, or spice things up with one covered in sequins or glitter.

Paint your nails.,
Give your cheeks a healthy glow.,
Create some drama with smoky eyes.,
Wear red.,
Coat yourself in glitter.",How to Dress on New Year's Eve (for Women)3," If you already have a sparkly dress, keep things simple with a solid yet colorful hue on your fingers. On the other hand, a glitter nail polish works well with your little black dress or solid color ensemble.

, Apply a little blush or bronzer to the apples of your cheeks to bring color and life back to your skin.

, Layer on dark eyeliner and mascara before brushing various shades of gray, brown or black shadow over your lids. Incorporate a little color by selecting a colored eyeshadow in a deep, rich shade.

, Many women may hesitate to wear red lipstick, but most can find a shade that flatters their skin tone with enough searching. Red lipstick adds drama and makes a statement, which makes it the perfect addition to an eye-catching New Year’s Eve outfit.

, Look for an eyeshadow or lipstick previously infused with glitter, or brush a light coating of glitter dust over your cheeks or along your collarbone. Do not overdo it, though. Pick one feature to accentuate with glitter and only apply a light amount.

"
"
Look for a metallic heel.,
Try out a sturdier heel.,
Look sexy in a little strappy number.,
Opt for flats.",How to Dress on New Year's Eve (for Women)4," A solid metallic gold, silver, or bronze is an effective way to add shimmer and shine to your look. For a bolder option, check out a pump covered in glitter or sequins.

, Platforms and booties may make it easier for you to dance and move around in, especially if you are not used to narrow stick heels.

, High heels covered in straps have a festive, flirty ambiance and look great with many cocktail dresses.

, If comfort is your main concern, a flat adorned in sparkles or colored gems makes a wonderful alternative to a heel.

Determine the parade route.,
Research the hotels and motels along most of the parade route.,
Camp out in a hotel room not far from your parade route spot from about 10pm the Wednesday night before until at least 5am on Thanksgiving.

,
Give yourself ample hours of additional wait-time before the parade, to ensure you are in the proper viewing spot with a great viewing angle.,
Ensure that you will be warm enough to attend the parade the next day.,
Plan on a long day the following day (Thanksgiving Day).,
Try to wake up several hours before the parade.

",How to Attend the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade," Although things changed in 2013 for the parade route, the newest parade route tends to be to march from the corner of 77th St and Central Park West to the southern edge of the park near Columbus Circle, then walk East to 6th Avenue/Avenue of the Americas and continue South to 34th Street, making an appearance at 42nd Street, and continuing on till they reach Herald Square and the big Macy's New York Headquarters area at 151 West 34th Street.The total length of the Macy's Parade Route is around 2.5-mile and it takes around 90 minutes for the parade to walk the this route., Hotels here are a little light, and where they exist, it's ""mom and pop"" hotels that you would never have guessed in a million years could have been a hotel to exist at the location. Bigger hotel chains do exist, but are a few blocks from most of the famous sites in New York City near the parade route including a Quality Inn within 10 blocks from New York's Penn Station train station and about 10-12 blocks from Macy's. You'll have to do a little more searching by Macy's address to find major hotel brands nearest the street address on the major hotel brands' websites to find spots to relax.

,, There are masses of people that line the sidewalks along both sides of the parade route, and getting to there super-early is crucial to seeing the parade.


Don't pick a fight, if you don't get to your predetermined area at the same time as that of others that have reached to your spot first. Tensions always grow, and sometimes walking a few parade route light-poles down/up from your predetermined spot can help you achieve what you need to achieve to ensure that you get the same results as that of your predetermined spot the day before, before hair flies.
Don't look like you are lurking around just waiting for your spot to become free. If a police spots you, it's hard to explain to them what you are doing and explain that you were waiting for the parade to begin.

, Find out the forecast for the next day. End of November temperatures for New York City (borough of Manhattan) tend to be quite chilly, and sometimes even some snow begins to fall. Although few snowfalls tend to graduate to more than a general dusting (or half an inch in spots), it's crucial that you know what to expect during your few days of camping out.


Bundle up in several layers of warmth. Don't expect warm weather. Your time spent there will be super-chilly. Use at least 3 additional layers of jackets and sweaters as you would have otherwise used during other camping sessions. Dress children in 2 or more footed blanket sleepers along with 1-2 winter-weight jackets and at least one pair of ""bib-style"" snow pants.

, The parade lasts about 2-3 hours, but it's an exciting few hours that is well needed for most.


You'll know later, that it's over when you see Santa arrive on his annual float into the Square.

If everyone is contributing to the meal, then you can make lists of what everyone is bringing, and you can even ask guests to pick up something from the store at the last minute. Taking over guest duty can be a big help to your family, especially if a lot of people are coming.;
, Make it clear that you want to make an effort this Thanksgiving and tell your parents that you're willing to help any way you can. They may say that you shouldn't worry about it, that you're too young to really contribute, or that they've got everything under control. However, you need to be firm and explain that you want to help no matter what, and no matter how small or unpleasant the task may be. Talking to your parents will give you a better idea of what really needs to be done, and will show you how you can best minimize the stress on the big day.

, If you have enough time and the food hasn't been purchased yet, ask your parents if you can do the grocery shopping for them -- provided that you have a car and they trust you to drive, that is. If you don't have a car and walking to the grocery store or biking there isn't an option, ask if you can go to the grocery store along with your parents to make the shopping process easier.

, If you're under 16, you can't drive, so you couldn't run to the supermarket or pick up Grandma from the airport. Helping your parents around the house can give them time to do more. Your parents also might not feel comfortable leaving you around the stove or with you using knives. Don't get too pushy about doing everything, but do try to find something safe and useful for yourself to do.

, A clean home is the best setting for Thanksgiving dinner. Even if it's not perfectly neat, things should be relatively organized and dust-free. Clear an area for guests to put their shoes, coats, and bags so they aren't in the way. Don't forget about the bathroom!

, You don't need to go overboard, but a few autumn touches here and there are nice. Remember, after Thanksgiving and fall are over, you'll need to store all the decorations somewhere (unless you got disposable ones) so don't go crazy. You could hand make decorations, or check your local party store for inexpensive ones. Consider:


A banner
Napkin rings
A centerpiece
A wreath
Pumpkins or gourds
Scented candles with fragrances such as pumpkin, apple, or spice
Silk leaves to scatter on the table or garlands

, Ask your parents if you are unsure if you really need them. Place cards can be helpful if:


There are younger children who need to sit next to their parents
A handicapped guest needs to sit somewhere easily accessible for him or her
The host or hostess needs to sit close to the kitchen
Certain guests don't get along and should not be seated next to each other

, It will save your parents time so they can finish preparing the meal. If you're using place cards, put wine glasses at the seats of guests who will be drinking. If there are younger children seated at the table, consider not putting a knife at their seat, for safety reasons.

, You don't have to be a master chef to help out in the kitchen. All you need to do is to be vigilant and to put in the time your mother or other relatives may not have to take care of all of the little food-related details. Simple tasks that could save your parents time include:


Preparing/setting out appetizers
Reheating things that have already been cooked
Simple food preparation such as defrosting, peeling, mixing, etc.
Washing dishes or loading the dishwasher
With parental permission and supervision, prepare a side dish or dessert

, When your guests enter the house, greet them and tell them where to put their shoes, coats, and bags. If they are new to your home, you can orient them a bit, explaining where the bathroom or game room is so they know where to go. Your parents may be wrapped up in the kitchen and busy with all the preparations to give your guests enough attention when they first walk in, so you can make your visitors feel more at ease.


It's likely that your guests will arrive well before the meal. If so, offer them some appetizers if they are ready, and ask if they'd like a glass of water or a drink.

, If you've been driving and your parents trust you to do so, then you can be a big help. They may need someone to pick up last-minute food items on the big day, or to pick up guests or even drive them home. This is particularly useful because many people like to drink a bit on the big day and won't be able to operate a vehicle. Having a DD around will be a big help and will prevent anyone from getting into a dangerous situation.

, This is a great thing to do when people are either waiting for the meal or looking for something to do after they've stuffed themselves. This is where you come in. You should plan a fun game or activity in advance, whether it's a board game anyone can easily learn, a game of charades, a friendly game of football in the backyard, or even a family walk that you all take after the meal to help you aid digestion. You may even snap some family photos -- people will groan, but they'll be happy that you captured these memories later.


People may be too lazy or tired to think of something fun to do themselves, and having a game or activity in mind can make people happier and more excited to be together.
Make sure you have a few options. People may not be as excited about Scattergories or Twister as you might have imagined.

, It's likely that there are other younger people at the event, whether you're dealing with your own siblings, your cousins, or the children of other guests. Though you are only a teenager, they should respect you as if you were an adult, and it's your job to keep them in check, make sure that they aren't playing with their food or causing a scene, and just to watch over them to see that they're behaving in general. If someone throws a tantrum or makes a mess, you should deal with it as much as you can.


Of course, the kids have parents who can also look out for them, but if you help out in this department, the adults will have a much better time.
You can also plan a game or fun activity, like drawing hand turkeys, to keep the kids from whining and getting bored.
If there are older kids in the mix, then you can see if they can help contribute by cleaning up a bit, or accomplishing other simple tasks. This can be a great way to make other kids feel like ""grown ups"" -- without forcing it too much, of course.

, It's likely that people want to kick back and have a few alcoholic beverages, or just to have some soda and juice, and you can help out by pouring the drinks during and before the big meal. People may want a drink but could feel too shy to ask, especially if your parents look very busy. So, without being pushy, ask the guests if they want a drink from time to time and help them out.

, You can also help by creating a more fun environment for your family. Sure, not every relative will get along, especially if you have a big family, but you can help relieve the tension by cracking jokes, changing the subject if things get uncomfortable, and helping two relatives who are butting heads get along. Be on the lookout for tense situations, especially if you know that two family members or guests don't get along so well, and try to get in the middle without being annoying whenever you can.


If it's awkward just because it's a little quiet and nobody can think of anything to say, be prepared with a funny story about school or a recent trip that will make people laugh without being too inappropriate.

, Remember to give thanks for those things you are grateful for, and enjoy the time spent with your friends and family! Keep things positive and tell people how grateful you are to have them in your life, and even lead a Thanksgiving prayer if that is customary in your family. Do your best to make the mood light, fun, and filled with happiness about all of the things that you all share.

, One of the best things you can do to help is to clean up the kitchen and house once all of the guests have left. It's likely that your parents will be exhausted at this point, and they will be incredibly relieved if you offer to pitch in or to let them rest all together while you start to wash the dishes, put the leftovers in the fridge, and clean up any other messes that have been made. This will take a while, and enlisting the help of other siblings or teenagers will make the process go by faster, and will be much more fun as well.

Ask for a neighbor’s assistance.,
Use a slow cooker.,
Salvage an excessively salty gravy.,
Tackle missing or burnt side dishes.,
Replace missing ingredients.,
Order extra food from a restaurant.",How to Cope when Thanksgiving Dinner Goes Wrong1," If you have no more space on your stovetop or in your oven to cook all of the necessary dishes, see if your neighbor has any space left. They may be happy to help out and you can return the favor at a later date.;
, If you have no more space left on your stovetop, you could use a slow cooker for some of the dishes. Slow cookers are great because once you put the ingredients inside you don’t need to think about the recipe until the timer rings. This can help to reduce your stress as you prepare everything.


For example, you can make great mashed potatoes in a slow cooker and then keep the potatoes warm in it while you use the stovetop to cook other dishes., If the lid comes off your salt shaker and you manage to get too much salt in your gravy, you can still save it. Peel a potato and then leave it in your gravy for fifteen minutes. The potato will absorb the salt and nobody will know about the incident.


You could also replace it with a package of pre-made gravy.

, If you burn a side dish or forget to make one, you can either order one or use a pre-packaged side dish. If you forget to make the mashed potatoes or the recipe goes wrong in some way, you can use a pre-packaged side dish of mashed potatoes. If you do not have pre-packaged mashed potatoes on hand, you can order some mashed potatoes from a local restaurant., If you are missing a particular ingredient such as an herb, you can always replace it or ask a friend, guest or neighbor if they have it. Start by seeing if a friend, guest, or neighbor has the ingredient. Perhaps a friend can pick it up on the way to your house. If it is nowhere to be found, you can figure out a replacement ingredient or skip it altogether.


If you are missing an herb, you can often find a substitute.

, If you are overwhelmed with the number of ingredients to make or run out of time, you can always order out. Order some side dishes from a reputable restaurant.


If you cannot afford to order out or simply don't want to order out, try making some extra side dishes ahead of time and place them in the freezer just in case you need them. If you don’t end up needing them, then you can always defrost them and enjoy them later.

Keep a journal.",How to Accomplish Your New Year's Resolutions," These can be about anything, not just the big ones like quitting smoking and losing weight that many people associate with New Year's resolutions. Jot down some notes while doing the following:


Consider how you can improve your health. Ask yourself, Can I drink more water? Quit smoking? Stop eating fast food or fried food? Become vegetarian? Exercise more?
Consider your relationships with others. Are there ways that you can be a better spouse, parent, other family member, or friend?
Consider your work life. Ask yourself, Can I be more successful and happier at work? Be more organized? Stop procrastinating?
Consider ways to make a difference. Are there ways you could make a difference in the world through activism, awareness raising or promoting a cause?;
, Look over your notes and determine what items on it are most important to you. Don't take too long choosing; often it's the things that leap out at you straight away that have the most meaning for you personally.

, You need to break down large goals into smaller actions that can are easier to carry out. If you leave your larger goals too vague, you may get confused and change your mind frequently on the ways to accomplish them. This is the purpose of creating systems.


For example: if your goal is to lose 30 pounds in the following year, you can resolve to cut out fast food, soft drinks, sugary snacks and drinks, drink more water, and walk three days a week until March, and then gradually add in two days at the gym., Make sure your goals are:


S – Specific (or Significant). This means your goals include systems for achieving them. You have specific actions that can be carried out that work toward your larger goal.
M – Measurable. This means that the changes you see once the goal is reached is noticeable. You will feel different (better), because you are healthier, because your family or social life has improved, etc.
A – Attainable. This means that the goal is realistic and can be reached. There are benefits to aiming high, but you don’t want to aim so high that you become disappointed and discouraged from making any changes at all if you can’t reach the goal you set.

For instance, if you’ve never run a day in your life, don’t make running a marathon your goal quite yet. Perhaps start with shorter races like a 3K or 5K, and work up from there.


R – Relevant (or Rewarding). This means that there is a real need for your goal. You have been unsatisfied with a certain area of your life for some time, and you have a strong motivation to want to change it.
T – Trackable. This is similar to measurable, but means that you can assess your progress throughout the process. Have you made a schedule and are you following it? Are you losing weight gradually (if that’s your goal)? Are you getting along better with your loved ones? Etc. , Discuss your goals and why you made them with your family and friends. This step is very important!


Ask for others’ support on these goals throughout the year. If possible, team up and visit the gym or shop at the health food store together. Ask them to speak up if you slip and order a Diet Coke instead of a water, or forget another goal on your list.
People who tell others about their goals are more likely to accomplish them, whether it’s because they have extra support they need, or because they’re afraid of being embarrassed if they don’t accomplish them, it’s hard to say., Save a copy on each computer or electronic device you own, such as your cell phone and tablet.


Email a copy to your work address and save it to your work computer.
Make a smaller copy and keep it in your wallet.
Post a copy on the outside of your refrigerator! Use bright paper so it catches your eye and don't let it get hidden behind coupons and artwork.

, Even more important than a specific deadline for your goals is to set a schedule of how you will reach the goal. Some goals are actually life-long changes that you will continue after the goal is reached.


For instance, systems for weight loss and for improving your relationships don’t necessarily “end” once you’ve reached the goal. To keep weight off, you have to maintain the healthier lifestyle system that you created. To maintain healthy relationships, you would want to continue the things you started doing in your resolutions. So consider:
If the goal is losing weight, be sure that you have researched a healthy amount of time to lose a certain amount of weight, and write down your exercise schedule and the changes you will make in your diet for each day.
If you’re trying to be a better parent or friend, or to be more successful at work, make a schedule of when and how you will do each thing that’s on your systems list., Don't wait for inspiration to strike. The best thing to do is start on January 1st and start tracking your progress.


If your goal is to lose weight, don’t say, “I’ll start tomorrow.” Start right away! Starting may actually be the toughest part, but once you get into a routine it should become easier. , Set up dates for evaluation with a mentor. This helps you to stay focused and evaluates methods for improvement.


It's even better if you find someone who has the same resolution. If you have a friend who’s also trying to lose weight, check in with each other and motivate each other. It may also help to consult with your doctor or a trainer about your progress

, For every day on your calendar or schedule, write down what you will do for that day, what time you will do it, and don't forget to actually do it, no matter how busy you are.


If your goal is losing weight, write down what you will eat, and when and how you will exercise each week.

, Take each step one at a time and be happy with your progress. The only way you'll get to where you want to go is to complete every small step along the way, checking it off with pride as you accomplish each step.Remind yourself of the weight you are losing or how you are feeling healthier instead of the fact that you haven’t reached a certain number of lost pounds yet. You will get there.

, It’s also good to get rid of habits that don’t coincide with your goals and may contribute to you being unable to reach them.


For example, set your running shoes next to the door. Put fruits and veggies in the front of the fridge. Get rid of the junk food and don’t buy more.
If something you regularly do for fun with family and/or friends includes eating out at places where most of the food is unhealthy, choose a different place that offer healthy meals. Or, don’t eat out at all and do something else like go for a walk or a bike ride instead.

, Determine ahead of time what rewards will be at small milestones of accomplishment. Have frequent small rewards and a “grand prize” for completion.


If your goal is losing weight, you might buy new clothes to replace old ones that don’t fit anymore at each milestone, and then plan a nice vacation for when you’ve reached your goal.

, It can be hard to maintain your motivation and dedication to making a change in your life when you can't see immediate results for your efforts.


At each low point, have faith that persisting and being consistent in reaching your goal will pay off in the long run. If you’re trying to lose weight and are struggling to keep up with your workouts, just think about how each minute you exercise burns fat and gets you closer to your goal., Fearing change often stops us from achieving a goal. Making a goal sounds good at the time, but then the fear of change surfaces. To avoid this happening to you, realize that your excuses are a way of covering up a fear of change.


Look beyond ""I can't"" and start substituting this with ""I can"" and ""I am"".
Identify your excuses for not going through with parts of your goal. By listing excuses, you can see them for what they are and move beyond the fear of change.
Sidestep blaming other people or circumstances for not achieving your goals. If you take responsibility for achieving your goal, these external factors cannot sap your power to do what you've said you'd do.

, Write down the things you do out of habit that distract you from what really matters. Then, list things that you consider to be more positive and fulfilling behaviors and choices you want to make instead.


This includes adjusting the habits mentioned in a previous step, even if they were things you once enjoyed. For instance, if are trying to lose weight and you eat out with family or friends as bonding time, either choose restaurants that offer healthy meals or decide to do something else fun together instead of eating out.

, Everyone encounters occasional outside stressors and events that take us out of focus on our goals. Use Monday as your day to regroup and start over if you slip and have a bad week completing your goals for any reason.


The “Monday Campaigns” is a group of nonprofit health organizations that organize various healthy things to do on Mondays, such as “Meatless Mondays,” “De-Stress Mondays,” and “Move-It Mondays.” Don’t be too hard on yourself if you slip and remind yourself of the progress you have made.

Make do without a roasting pan.,
Deal with a frozen turkey.,
Keep your cooked turkey warm.,
Rehydrate a dry turkey.,
Salvage edible meat from a burnt turkey.",How to Cope when Thanksgiving Dinner Goes Wrong2," If you start your Thanksgiving day without a roasting pan, there are a few ways of making do with what you have or purchasing something. Although the kitchen store will be closed, you can probably get something from a grocery store or from your neighbor. Try to find one of the following options:An aluminum roaster. A cheap aluminum roaster can be used for cooking your turkey. If you use two of them, layered on top of one another, you will be able to hold more heat.
Use a broiler pan. Remove the broiler from the top and put the turkey in. Throw a baking sheet below to catch any drippings.
Use a rimmed baking sheet if your turkey is especially large or you don’t have other options.

, Typically, a fourteen-pound turkey will take four days to defrost in the fridge. If you forget to defrost your turkey ahead of time, you should defrost it using cold water. Put the frozen turkey in a clean five-gallon bucket filled with cold water. You can also fill your clean sink with cold water. It is important to use cold water because warm water poses food safety concerns. Let the bird defrost for seven hours and then cook it.If you cook a frozen turkey without covering it with foil or a pot lid, you may end up with a burnt outside and an uncooked middle.
It takes three days to defrost a turkey in the fridge, depending on the size of the turkey and the temperature setting of your fridge.

, If you finish cooking your turkey ahead of time, there are a few ways to keep your turkey warm and ready for the main meal. If your turkey is finished one hour ahead of time, let it rest for thirty minutes. Then, put some foil over the turkey to keep it warm. Avoid using a lid because you don’t want to overcook the turkey.


If your turkey is done several hours ahead of time, you can let it rest for thirty minutes. Slice it up and put it on a platter. Put it in the fridge. Twenty minutes before serving time, throw it in the oven at 350 Fahrenheit (176 Celsius) for fifteen minutes and then put it on the table., If your turkey stayed in the oven too long and got dry, you can still save it. Slice the turkey and put it in a dish or leave it in the roasting pan. Pour three cups of chicken or turkey stock over the sliced turkey. Put it in the oven for a few minutes before serving.If it tastes like cardboard, you know it is dry.
If you touch it with a fork and you see some moisture, you know it is rehydrated. You can also try tasting it.

, If the turkey gets burnt, you should try to see if there is a way to save it. Start by identifying the burnt parts of the turkey. If the outside is burnt but the meat on the inside is fine, you can remove the burnt parts and serve the good parts. Another option is to make a new dish with the turkey.Make a turkey stew with the burnt turkey or a burnt-end turkey barbecue dish. Start by removing the most burnt parts of the turkey. With the remaining parts, make a stew or smother the turkey in barbeque sauce.
You will need your leftover turkey or at least half to three quarter pounds of turkey. In addition, you will need the following ingredients: two carrots cut into half inch pieces; three celery stalks cut into half inch pieces; one chopped onion; three cloves of minced garlic; four cubed potatoes; thirty-two ounces of chicken or turkey stock; a teaspoon of dried sage; a teaspoon of curry powder; two tablespoons of olive oil; salt and pepper.
To make the stew, heat the olive oil over medium heat, add the garlic and onion and cook until translucent. Add the potatoes, carrots, celery and the stock. Bring the stock to a boil, reduce and simmer for fifteen minutes. Add your curry and sage and the cook for another five minutes. Finally, add your turkey and cook until it is warm. Serve with salt and pepper."

Put out some snacks.,
Let people serve themselves.,
Maintain flexibility about seating.,
Air out a smoky house.,
Clean up any and all messes.",How to Cope when Thanksgiving Dinner Goes Wrong3," Having lots of finger foods for your guests to snack on can help to ensure that they will leave satisfied. For example, you can put out:


A tray of various vegetables like tomatoes, zucchini, baby carrots, cucumbers, celery, peppers, along with some dips like ranch and/or hummus.
Potato chips and various dips. You can buy these pre-made at the grocery store and placed into a fancy dish.
A variety of crackers and hard and/or spreadable cheeses.

, If you are feeling overwhelmed by all of the cooking, avoid the step of plating the dinner. Instead, ask guests to come and serve themselves in the kitchen. Alternately, you can put all of the food on the table and ask guests to serve themselves. Many people prefer this approach as it is less formal and involves a more relaxed intimate family environment.

, If you had a seating plan and it is forgotten or people ignore it, try not to get too stressed out about it. Instead, let people sit where they want to sit and enjoy the meal.

, If you burn a dish and your house gets really smoky, you should turn off the burner, put the burnt dish aside, and open the windows. While the house is airing out, you can boil some water with some cloves and cinnamon sticks. In a few minutes, the house will smell festive instead of burnt.


If you have an aromatherapy diffuser, you could use it to mask the smell of smoke.
If you have scented candles, you could use them to improve the smell of the house.

, If there is a mess, clean it up and then relax. Spilled water, milk, broken glass, spilled gravy, stains, and other messes are common during the Thanksgiving holiday. Try not to let these messes stress you out. Take a few deep breaths, clean up the mess, and get back to the celebrations.


If a guest breaks a glass dish or drops a glass of wine on the floor, you can quickly clean it up with a broom and a dustbin. Once you have cleaned up the broken glass with the broom, use a sponge to pick up any remaining shards of glass. You might want to tell people to wear their shoes in that area of the house.Tell people to relax and go into a different room while you clean up.

Cope with hurtful comments.,
Maintain boundaries.,
Make a gratitude bowl.,
Relax about traditions.",How to Cope when Thanksgiving Dinner Goes Wrong4," Thanksgiving can be an emotionally difficult time. If you are on the receiving end of a hurtful comment from a family member during the holidays, it can be hard not to lose control. Take a minute to yourself to collect your thoughts, remind yourself of your self-worth and then talk to a trusted friend or partner about your experience.


If you are on the receiving end of a hurtful comment, take a time out from Thanksgiving and call a close friend. If you are the host, ask a close friend or family member to do your work while you take a short break.
If you don’t feel safe, you can always leave the Thanksgiving dinner.If you are the host and are not feeling safe, you can always ask people to leave.

, Thanksgiving can also go poorly when people fail to respect boundaries. It is best to know your boundaries going into the Thanksgiving dinner. You may not want to talk about particular topics such as religion, politics, or a former partner. If a friend or family member brings up one of these topics, you can politely tell them that you do not want to talk about that topic. You can also suggest a different topic that you feel more comfortable talking about., If relationships are feeling tense at Thanksgiving this year, you might try an activity to foster gratitude amongst your guests. Put a bowl in the middle of the dinner table. Distribute pencils and small pieces of paper to your guests. Ask everyone to write down one thing for which they feel thankful in their lives. Tell them they are free to keep the gratitude note to themselves or to put it in the gratitude bowl. At the end of the evening, ask a volunteer to read a few of the gratitude notes that have been placed in the blow.

, If you miss a traditional part of your Thanksgiving meal, avoid making it into a big deal. You can always bring the tradition back next year. Relax and enjoy the rest of the meal.

They will also need people to collect the food, check that there is enough food for everyone expected, set up the service area, help those people coming to the soup kitchen find the place and be served and seated, etc. and make deliveries. They also need help with cleanup afterward. If you're flexible about the role you're prepared to take on, then you can find yourself indispensable for the day!


Search for soup kitchens in your area. There may be advertisements in the paper or online on sites such as Craigslist asking for people to help out on Thanksgiving. You can also see if a local church is running a soup kitchen nearby.
Check 1800volunteer.org or the Corporation for National Community Service for possible volunteer opportunities in your area.Other places include the Salvation Army, Rescue Mission and your local church, synagogue or other place of worship.
Your workplace might be organizing something. Check your internal bulletin board or leave a request on it to have others contact you if they need helpers.;
, Look for organizations that bring Thanksgiving meals to people in need. Many of them will be very happy to have additional drivers and delivery people available on Thanksgiving Day.


All you have to do is to pick up the meal as instructed and deliver it to the people on your list.
If you have been asked to help the person prepare the meal or spend a few minutes chatting, add this into your schedule.

, Call local hospitals and nursing homes. Ask if there is someone who may need company on Thanksgiving or if there are things you can do to make the day more pleasant and enjoyable for residents or patients. Call ahead to determine if children must be a certain age to visit hospital patients. You might talk with them, sing, perform or help serve the meals. If you're asked to stay around for the meal, engage everyone near you in conversation and ask them about their experiences of previous Thanksgivings to help break the ice.


If you're visiting children in hospital, consider taking along a small gift such as a teddy bear, to help improve their Thanksgiving Day as a patient.

, Inquire in your city or town about fundraisers like marathons which raise money to help families in need on Thanksgiving. If you cannot pay an entry fee, ask about volunteering your time to the event.

, The holiday season is very busy at the Salvation army, and you can volunteer there and help the families in need of assistance by doing anything from taking down their information to helping them explore their options.

, The elderly may be lonely around the holidays if they have nowhere to go or aren't up to leaving their home. You can volunteer at a home for the elderly and do anything from decorating the home to make it look more festive to helping cook and distribute the Thanksgiving meal. Giving your time and spending some time with the elderly to cheer them up and ask how they're doing is also a great way to volunteer. Many people feel extra lonely on the holidays, and you can make a big impact., Instead of expecting one person to do most of the preparation and serving, stand in for them instead. While this isn't quite ""volunteering"", it is a huge gift of time and love for someone you care about.

, Work out who usually does most of the work for Thanksgiving and tell them that you're taking over this time and giving them a well-earned rest. Just be sure to let them know they're welcome to help if they still want to though, as you don't want them to feel left out!


If you don't want to do it all alone (it's a big task), enlist some helpers.
Tell the person who usually does the lion's share of the work to relax and to really prepare themselves to enjoy Thanksgiving without a care.

, As well as your own family, consider inviting as many people as you can feed, especially people who might be alone on Thanksgiving, and people who may not be able to afford their own dinner. This might be an elderly neighbor or two, someone from a local nursing home or someone from your local church. This can be your ""volunteer"" touch to the meal.

, Shop for fresh things the day before Thanksgiving but you should order the turkey earlier to be sure to get the one you want. Some of the usual things needed include:


At least one big turkey

Sausage stuffing for the turkey
Gravy
Potatoes
Vegetables such as sweet potato, corn, turnips, parsnips, pumpkin, etc.
Wine, non-alcoholic beverages
Apple or pumpkin pie or some other type of pie
Ice cream
Coffee and tea.

, If you haven't done this before, it consists of:


Reading and following the instructions on how to roast the turkey.
While the turkey is roasting in the oven, start working on the other foods which you plan to have for the Thanksgiving feast (for example, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, stuffing for the turkey, etc).
Start preparing the dessert/s which you plan to have for the huge feast. Most likely, you will have either a pumpkin or an apple pie.

, Place a nice, clean tablecloth upon the table. Get out some fine cutlery, and glasses for the drinks. Perhaps you may even have some mugs out for coffee afterwards too.


Put some candles on the table. Candlelit dinners are very elegant.

, In particular, make a fuss of the person you're standing in place for, the one who usually does most of the work. Seat them at the head of the table and let everyone else know that they must take good care of this person!

, Encourage everyone to eat up and enjoy themselves.

, Just be sure to enlist many helpers or it will take forever.

Here are some things you'll need to do to get ready for that meal:


Write down a grocery list of items needed for the meal. Check the pantry to see what you don't have and prepare a list for the items you'll need. Then, visit the local farmers' market, butcher, the supermarket, and the bakery. It helps to divide the list into these different items to avoid confusion.
Shop for the Thanksgiving meal in advance. Pre-order the turkey and any other items that might sell out quickly before the holiday. If you can freeze items in advance, buy them early to help reduce the frustration of last-minute grocery shopping. Baked goods are best bought fresh on the day of if possible, but if not, you can bake them yourself at home.
You should also call your guests to confirm that they'll be coming. When you talk to them, see if they want to contribute anything to the meal. This will take some of the burden off of you.;
, Knowing in advance what you'll cook ensures that you can shop for the ingredients and know the timing required for each item in the lead-up to Thanksgiving and on the day itself. For menu and recipe ideas, here are some suggestions to start with:



The turkey: Cook a turkey, stuff a turkey, and make a turkey dinner.

The vegetables: Make old fashioned string beans, roast potatoes, roast sweet potatoes, pumpkin puree, and parsnip and turnip deliciousness.

Accompaniments: Make cranberry sauce, use cranberries for Thanksgiving and dinner rolls.

Baked goods: Bake pumpkin pie, pumpkin log roll, cornucopia place cards for Thanksgiving, and Thanksgiving cookies. You can also use pumpkins for a variety of other Thanksgiving desserts.

Food for vegetarians: Make a vegetarian Thanksgiving dinner and tofurkey (tofu not a turkey).
Prepare casual foods such as appetizers, candies, and sandwiches for snacking. This way, if you plan to eat late, you and your guests won't be starving before the meal. You can even make candy turkeys -– ideal for the kids to make and enjoy!

, Some things can be done prior to the day, such as baking cookies and pumpkin pie, while other things need to be made fresh on the day, such as roasting the turkey. Whenever you're cooking, don't be afraid to ask for help; it'll make your life and holiday much easier. You can also consider cooking two small turkeys instead of one to simplify the process. Here are some things you'll have to do to prepare the food for your holiday:



Defrost the turkey in plenty of time. Note that this may take several days depending on the size and weight of the turkey.
Bake the pumpkin pie or other favorite pies a day in advance. You'll be glad you did when focused on preparing the main course on Thanksgiving Day.

Roast the turkey and complete the meal preparations on Thanksgiving Day. Brush up on your turkey carving skills before the day.
Have family members or friends who've arrived early help cook or prepare certain dishes to ease the workload.

, Arrange the table decorations the day before Thanksgiving if you have a separate dining table available. If not, lay out the items somewhere readily accessible for quick deployment on the day. Get the kids to help set the table as part of their contribution to the preparations. Here are some other ways to make your table more festive:


To be extra decorative, buy or make a Thanksgiving-themed centerpiece or create your own for display on the table. Ready-made centerpieces or DIY kits can be found at any craft store, and making it yourself is a fun project for kids or even for guests who are at a loose end for something to do.
Scented candles, a cornucopia, or a bouquet of autumn flowers are also good ideas for dinner table centerpieces.
You can also make Thanksgiving place tags or a turkey shaped Thanksgiving place card holders as well.

Create a turkey napkin holder.

Make a Thanksgiving flower arrangement. This can be placed on the table or on a sideboard.
Make sure you have enough seats for all of your guests. If you're short on chairs, little ones can sit on pillows on the floor and eat over a coffee table.

, You can do these things before, during, or after you eat your Thanksgiving meal. There are a few traditions associated with the Thanksgiving holiday that are enjoyed in many families, and here are a few things that you can do:


Gather around the TV and watch football. Spending hours watching football on Thanksgiving is a holiday favorite for many fans, and it's a great way to pass time before the meal. Alternatively, organize a backyard football game with family, friends, and neighbors for fun and a little exercise to make way for the meal.
Watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on TV with the kids. Broadcast on television from New York City from NBC, CBS and AFN Television (if your family has active serving military personnel) and also from YouTube via the Verizon YouTube channel (starting in 2016), the parade is extremely popular and viewed by millions at home and by US military personnel outside the country. Take a break and attend a local Thanksgiving parade if time permits, or watch it on television. The best holiday parades outside of NY are in Philadelphia (the nation's oldest launched in 1918), Detroit, Dallas, Chicago and Plymouth (Albert held on the weekend before the holiday).

, Thanksgiving is a chance for many families to spend time together after being apart for much of the year; it is a good time to reflect on the love that you have for one another, as well as sharing your thoughts about what you feel grateful for. Think of your family's own ways to express your gratitude on this day and in the year to follow, or be guided by some of the following suggestions:


Play the A to Z family gratitude game. Have everyone sit together so that they can hear and see one another. Going around the group of family and friends, have each person say what they're grateful for, according the whichever letter of the alphabet the player is up to. For example, player one says ""I am grateful for Aunty Lorna"", player two says ""I am grateful for my brothers"", and player three says ""I am grateful for caring moms"", etc. Keep going around the group until you've exhausted the alphabet. This can be videotaped as a lovely memento.
You can also create a new Thanksgiving tradition.
This can be the perfect day to start a gratitude journal that you aim to keep until next Thanksgiving, expressing your gratitude for small things and other people throughout the year ahead.

, Volunteer time before or during Thanksgiving to help prepare meals at a homeless shelter, donate extra cans and packaged goods to a soup kitchen, start a food or clothing drive, make a donation. This can be an essential part of teaching your children about gratitude in action.

, Everyone's likely to feel a little drowsy and well fed after the meal. It's a great opportunity to settle down to some relaxing activities. Ideas to help inspire you include:



Go for a walk as a family. Don't forget to take your dog for his usual walk too, especially if he's been getting snacks he'd normally not have.

Entertain guests. Play charades, tell stories, share photos around, catch up on news, etc.
Catch up on your reading. There is always something you've got on hold that you'd like to read; take this opportunity to do so.
Watch a movie. Check out the TV guide for any suitable movies, or pull out your favorite DVDs.
Play a board game. If the kids are still hyper, suggest that they make a board game and then play it!

, If you plan on participating in Black Friday the following day from the earliest of hours, you'll be thankful you got the extra sleep. And even if you don't plan on going anywhere -- it's okay to doze off on the couch for a little while. It'll make you feel better and will give you the energy you need to face the rest of the day.

, Though your guests can take away some of your food, it's likely that you'll be left with a ton of extra food. The next day, once you've recovered your energy, you can make some of the following delicious meals from your leftovers:


Turkey and stuffing casserole
Turkey soup
A moist maker (turkey sandwich)
A ""day after"" Thanksgiving turkey sandwich
Turkey au gratin with sherry
Turkey hash

Make use of the turkey leftovers in various other ways.

Expect to spend between five and eight days on board the ship as it travels through the Arctic Ocean to the North Pole.
The 50 Years of Victory (the ship that sails to the North Pole) has a variety of amenities to keep you busy during the voyage, including a swimming pool and a bar."

Book a guide or enter a race.,
Fly to Russia or Canada.,
Ski north.",How to Get to the North Pole3," You can also visit the North Pole by traveling overland from Russia or Canada, typically by skiing, dragging a sled called a ""pulk,"" and camping on the ice. You can do this either by booking a private guide or entering a race.


There are several organized races to the North Pole, including the Polar Challenge and the North Pole Race, which take you 300 miles (480 km) over the ice to the magnetic north pole.Starting in 2016, the Ice Race will provide a similarly grueling overland trip.Expect to spend roughly $35,000 dollars to participate in one of these expeditions. The cost includes training, flights, equipment, food, and insurance.Because these races are only open to a relatively small number of people, you'll have to contact the organizers for more information about registration, cost, etc. The Ice Race has an online form you can fill out, or you can email the organizer.Note that these races take you to the magnetic North Pole (the point the compass points to), rather than the geographical ""True North"" North Pole.
Private guides can also be hired for an even longer trip from Russia or Canada. This 500 mile trek is known as a ""full distance"" North Pole expedition.These expeditions typically depart in February.The full distance trip is by far the most extreme and costly option, and is only open to those with the funds and experience to make the trek. You'll need to contact the company providing guides for pricing.Adventure Consultants, one company that offers guides for full distance journeys, has a booking form on their website that you can fill out if you are serious about one of these trips.After you fill it out, they'll contact you to let you know whether you are eligible and if they can accommodate your adventure.
To even consider one of these overland trips, you should be in excellent health and must be able to certify that this is the case. Additionally, some guides for full distance trips require climbing experience and in some cases even prior experience with an ice axe and crampons., Book a ticket to your starting point for your race or expedition.


Organized races typically start from Resolute Bay in the northern Canadian region of Nunavut.Regularly scheduled flights from major Canadian cities such as Ottawa and Montreal are available through the First Air, Calm Air, and Canadian North airlines.Full distance trips typically leave from Cape Arktichevsky, Russsia, or Ward Hunt Island, Canada. To reach either of these locations, you normally have to charter a private flight, which can be extremely costly.If you take one of these trips through Adventure Consultants, however, they will organize a flight to Ward Hunt Island from Resolute Bay., Head north with your expedition until you reach the pole. These overland trips are grueling. You and your team or guide will spend 8-10 hours each day skiing over snow and ice.


This journey is treacherous, and will require you to navigate over pressure ridges, search for routes around areas where the ice has melted, and camp on pans of ice.At night, you'll take part in cooking dinner, and set up camp by building snow walls to block the wind. Temperatures can be as low as -40 degrees.
If you are going with one of the race groups, expect to spend about four weeks on the ice.If you are going on a full distance trip, you should expect to spend roughly 60 days.Some of the races and some private guides also have options for shorter trips that begin closer to the pole and only take about two weeks.If you can't commit to a month or more on the ice, it may be worth considering one of these options.
Upon reaching the pole, you'll either camp there for the night, or be picked up by a helicopter and taken to Barneo ice station to spend the night, depending on conditions.The next day, you'll enjoy a hot meal at Barneo before flying back to civilization.

Avoid wolfing down your food.,

Get away from the table.,
Congratulate yourself on a job well done.",How to Avoid Overeating on Thanksgiving1," While you may be on a diet or watching your food intake, bringing any sense of deprivation into the day may cause you to overeat out of sheer rebelliousness against ""missing out"". Cut yourself a little slack and let yourself enjoy more food than usual on this special day. After all, the next day things can go back to normal.;
, Don't skip any of the meals during the day – eat breakfast and lunch. The only difference is that you may want to eat more lightly than usual. However, skipping eating normally will just tempt you to overeat at the Thanksgiving meal.


Snacks, if needed, should be raw veggies or fruit.







, Take one small piece or scoop of everything that you enjoy to begin with. Remind yourself that you can always take seconds! This approach is considerate of the need to avoid waste.


Using a smaller plate can also fool your eye into thinking that you have more on the plate. This is a traditional dieter's trick.







, Thanksgiving is a time of giving thanks for the food that is on the table. Think about the contents of your plate and how it was once alive and is now about to provide you with energy and nutrition. Think about all the people whose efforts brought the food to the table, from the farmer to the cook.

, Before you begin to eat, notice everything about the food on your plate. What are its colors, textures, aromas and anything else of note?

, This relates back to the previous step––as you bite, savor the things that you noticed about the food when you took time to assess, such as texture and taste. Also, small bites and slow chewing aids digestion, as enzymes in the mouth begin to break down the food for you.


Rest your eating implements on the plate between each bite.

, You're more likely to realize that you're full before you feel sick if you talk, rather than shovel food into your mouth non-stop! During the meal, make an effort to engage others in conversation in between bites. This shouldn't be too hard if family members you haven't seen for awhile turn up with news of the events in their lives.

, Eat slowly and savor the food you're consuming. If you finish everything on your plate, wait a minute. You can tell a story to everyone else, or just sit back and relax.

, Repeat the eat-wait-take more cycle until you feel satisfied, but not stuffed. Aim for feeling good, not feeling so stuffed that you can't eat another thing or feel ill.


Leave room for the dessert. One piece of pie or one scoop of dessert is sufficient to end the meal. If you feel too full, leave dessert until much later.

, Go for a walk, play football, entertain a child, play with a pet or help clean up! Head out to volunteer for those less fortunate on Thanksgiving. This will keep you from munching just because there's food in sight.


Stay away from snacks arranged away from the dinner table. If they're so tempting, move to another spot where the snacks are not in view.

, And laugh at everyone who feels so full they can't move! In fact, you might take a moment to share the secret of enjoying a Thanksgiving meal mindfully with them––just don't be preachy.

Find out the reasons for the move.,
Talk to your friends.,
Do a sort of project and present to your parents the reasons why you shouldn't move.

,
Present your argument calmly.,

, They probably don't want you to go and they might help for arguments.

,, If you're being unreasonable, your parents are never going to listen to you.

, If the move has something to do with the schools or something of the sort, prove to them that it's a safe, fun environment to learn in. They'll see for themselves.

, If the move is voluntary, swear that you'll do all your chores and homework and schoolwork from then on if they don't move. Promises of their child's good behavior might convince them.

, If you're at their ankles, whining and pleading, they won't listen. Always be calm and rational.

, This doesn't mean throwing a fit because it's ""not fair!"" Have a talk with your parents and tell them how you feel. If that doesn't work, subtly be a little upset in day-to-day life. For example, writing in your journal that you really don't want to move and leaving it out, or just acting a little sad around the house. If your parents can pick up on it, they will feel bad.

, It's really not the end of the world. If you automatically think it's going to be terrible, you'll never grow to like your new house.

, For example, ask your parents if you can visit your friends over Christmas break if you get all straight A's.

, Write to them, telling them about your new life and ask them to write about themselves as well. You'll both feel like you never left.

, You won't be disloyal if you do. It's not going to help anything if you're stuck in the past. Not to mention, you'll grow so attached to your old friends that no one at your new school is going to want to be friends with you.

, Riptides and undercurrents can make a seemingly gentle ocean suddenly become dangerous when they start pulling people out to sea. 80 percent of lifeguard rescues are due to rip currents. Checking surf reports to see if there are any storms that can churn up the ocean is also important if you plan on snorkeling or sailing.

, This is extremely important if children are coming. Remember, just because there are lifeguard towers, doesn’t mean they will be on duty while you’re swimming. Some lifeguards are only on duty until 5 or 6 PM. Ask the lifeguards where the safest places are for children to swim.

, Make sure you are fully equipped with everything you may need including:


Fully stocked first aid kit
Prescription medications including inhalers or Epipens.
Swimsuits and shoes
Sunscreen of at least 30 SPF
Map of the area
Umbrellas for shade
Beach towels and blanket
Cooler with ice, drinks, and bottled water
Food like sandwiches, jerky, crackers, trail mix, cookies, and fruit.
Chairs
Beach toys

, Never leave a child unattended at the beach. Even though lifeguards are present, never assume they will watch over little children or specific individuals. They are there to scan and watch the waters for animal and water dangers, as well as the general beach-goers.

, To protect your head and spine, always go feet first. It may be more shallow than you estimated and there may be sharp rocks below.

, Prolonged sun exposure and sweating can leave you dehydrated before you even realize what’s happened. Avoid tea and caffeinated sodas because they act as diuretics and can dehydrate you even more. Water and sports drinks like Gatorade are good for replacing lost water and electrolytes.

You could note down the places by city or town, state or province, region or area. Or, choose features, such as mountains, fall leaves, rivers, beaches, good walking trails, winery trails, great antiques shopping opportunities, sporting events, etc.

, Decide which times of year they are best to visit. Also decide whether they're doable in one trip or whether you'll need various different trips at different times of the year.

, Without this, you won't go far! Figure out how much money it will cost to pay for things such as gas, hotel fees, food, and expenses for the places you want to visit.


Look for discount vouchers, coupons and offers. These might be online, available through tourist offices or through travel agents.
Check out package deals for the destination too. One might just be suitable for your needs.
Be careful not to mistakenly choose deals only offered to international travelers. Sometimes special rates only apply if you have a foreign passport and you're traveling from overseas.

, If you want warmth, hate rain or love the snow, be careful about when you choose to explore your country. Check out the average weather pattern for a year to help you decide when it's best to go. Obviously, you'll also need to match activities to the right time of year too, such as snow for skiing, warm weather for snorkeling and fall for leaf-peeping.

, Traveling with children, elderly people or the frail can present numerous challenges. However, since it's your own country, you have the benefit of still being covered for health costs, ready accessibility to the medicines and other things needed, as well as knowing the basics about how your country's systems function. That said, things can differ across states and provinces, so it pays to know ahead any information that might make your trip easier.

, There's nothing like a plan to travel to encourage you to put away money on a regular basis. But don't just save, also consider earning extra funds in different ways, to add to the exploration fund.


Sell unwanted items online or through car boot/yard/garage sales.
Make crafts and sell them online or at local markets.
Do some fundraising activities. There might even be someone else who would be willing to help out.

, Consider whether you need to hire a car or book plane tickets. Also be aware of accommodations issues; while you might be able to rock up spontaneously and stay in places sometimes, other times you might find that the hotels are all booked out because a rodeo is in town or it's wedding weekend. As part of your booking process, find out what might be happening in the places you want to visit and that will guide you as to whether or not you should book.


Even some campsites require booking, as they're so popular. Inquire ahead of going to the sites.

,, This will be determined by a range of factors, including distance, proximity and whether there are festivals, events or shows occurring that you'd like to catch while they're still happening.

, If you're going with a partner, make sure to include that person's wishes too. It can be a sore point if one of you does all the directing and the other person feels left out.

, You'll want to remember the trip when you return and digital photos are the ideal way to remember everything, from scenery to meals and favorite b&b's.

, If you like writing, it can be nice to keep documenting your exploration each day. Journals are best filled in during the quiet times, such as during a pit stop, just after dinner or just before bed.


Keep ticket stubs, stickers and other memorabilia for the journal.

, Unless you've determined it's a race, it is best to take the trip at an easy pace. You will want to enjoy what you are seeing and experiencing rather than whizzing through it.

, Everywhere you go, there is the potential for friendship and learning new things. Be open and receptive to meeting people, talking and learning what they think about things. You might discover new ways of seeing your own country.

, Enjoy what the region is famous for. In a large country, this will vary quite considerably, while in a smaller country, there will still be locally famous restaurants and cafes to try out. Ask the locals for advice.

Don't be afraid to rip it up and staple together only the pieces you need. A well-kept guidebook might make a nice souvenir, but it may not be worth the extra weight of carrying around information that you don't need.

, Before going on the trip, research what is and is not acceptable in your destination. When you arrive, observe how others act in person. Remember: some things are okay for locals to do, but not for tourists to do.

, This is just polite. Even if you struggle with it, the locals will appreciate that you've at least tried their language instead of rudely asking ""Do you speak English?"" (Or whatever your native tongue happens to be.) If you use the native language to ask for something, expect the reply to be in that language and at normal conversational speed – which is going to be faster than the audio lessons you learned. This is not to say that you shouldn't learn some basic greetings and questions. You should, however, be ready for the responses.

, Memorize it and note each of the places you will be visiting. Keep your map safe and dry. If you have access to a laptop or a smartphone (with data), you may not expressly need a physical map – but it is still usually smart to carry one as a backup.

, Examples include the ""dropped ring"" scam, the ""fake petition,"" and friendship bracelets tied on your wrist by aggressive vendors. Also be aware of other common crimes, especially pickpocketing. TSA approved travel locks and money belts are both helpful, especially in areas where pickpocketing is extremely common.


The infamous #64 bus in Rome, for instance, is popular with pickpockets because it's the only bus in Rome that hits all of the popular tourist destinations. It's usually packed with tourists, and thick with thieves.
Know what each local coin and bill is worth. For example, in Panama, everything is tied to the US dollar, so money comes in the same size, denomination, and material. In the UK, you'll find 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, and £2 coins, as well as 5, 10, 20, and 50 pound notes. By knowing your denominations and specifying how much you are handing over, you can help avoid another common scam: intentionally incorrect change.

Travel on a cruise ship.,
Decide whether to travel on a larger cruise ship or smaller one.,
Sail to Antarctica on a yacht.,
Travel on a French re-supply ship.",How to Travel to Antarctica1," By far the most common way to travel to Antarctica is on a special cruise ship. These trips vary, but are typically between 10 days and three weeks long.You can take various routes to the Peninsula depending on where you are departing from. The advantages of these cruises are that everything is provided on the ship, and you get to see Antarctica and its wildlife close-up for an extended period of time.


Most voyages to the Antarctic Peninsular region leave from Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego in Argentina, Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands and a few leave from Punta Arenas in Chile, Buenos Aires in Argentina, or Puerto Madryn in Argentina.;
, There are a variety of ship sizes that you can travel on, ranging from around 45 passengers total at the smaller end, to 280 passengers at the larger end. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. In general, the larger the ship the more comfortable and well-equipped it will be, but the less opportunity you will get to land on Antarctica yourself and see things up-close.


In high seas, larger ships are the most comfortable but the strict guidelines on how many people can visit the shore will limit your opportunities for shore visits.
Smaller ships allow for more time on shore. This is because tourist guidelines limit landings of tour groups to 100 people.All reputable cruise operators will be registered with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), so this is good place to consult during your planning. They support environmentally friendly travel to Antarctica.The costs for these cruises will vary, but for a ten day trip expect to pay at least $4500, whereas for the longer trips it could be from $12,750-$16,000., It is possible to reach Antarctica by yacht but this is not commonplace and is more for specialist yachtsmen than your average tourist. There are a number of yachting companies that are sanctioned by the IAATO and conduct trips to Antarctica who can you contact.Yachts tend to leave from Ushuaia or Stanley and are only for the very courageous and adventurous.


For these smaller ships, the conditions are much more treacherous than the larger cruise ships.This is a very expensive option that could cost more than $1000 a day for each traveller., One left-field option is to travel on a French re-supply vessel as a tourist. The ship, Marion Dufresne II, leaves from Réunion and the round-trip takes around a month.The number of tourists allowed aboard is limited and you will have to contact French tourist agencies for up-to-date information on departure schedules, availability and prices.Prices start from around $8,000 for the month."
"
Prepare your travel documents.,
Look into vaccine requirements.,
Get travel insurance.,
Decide where you're going to stay.,
Figure out how you're going to get around.,
Don't take animals, plants or anything else that's not accepted on flights.",How to Travel Abroad2," Make sure your passport is up to date and won't expire before your trip ends. Different countries have different requirements for passports and visas, but in general, your passport should not expire less than 6 months after your expected return date.

, The country you're going to may require you to have certain vaccines up to date. Make an appointment with your doctor to get this taken care of, as well as other medical considerations.

, Check you have the appropriate cover, and look into international health insurance. Chances are that you will never fall ill while traveling abroad, but it has happened. Bones have been broken; people have gotten food poisoning; pregnant women previously cleared for travel have gone into premature labor. Consider whether the added expense is worth being ""safe rather than sorry"".

, Housing choices are largely a matter of budget, comfort, and convenience. You can pay for a private hotel room or share a hostel; stay with friends or family; or explore online travel communities like Couchsurfing.com, AirBnB, or WWOOF.org.


Think about staying in an apartment if you'll be in one place for more than half a week. Hotels can be expensive, and you can often get much better deals for renting out someone's house. Furthermore, this approach might give you a more authentic idea of what it's like to live in a given city.
Consider a Bed and Breakfast or a self-service vacation rental. This last type of accommodation can help save money, as they're often cheaper than hotels, and you'll save money by buying your groceries and cooking there instead of going out to eat.

, Your options are broad and varied, and you'll have to choose the best mode of transportation to suit your itinerary. If you will be traveling long distances between destinations, you might consider flying or taking trains. If you'll be traveling within a city or region, try biking, renting a car, or using public transportation. Research the place you're going and try to understand how the locals get around.


Trains can be relaxing over long distances. Consider taking night trains – in theory, you can sleep on the train and awake as the train pulls into your next destination!
If you plan to rent a car, look into insurance requirements. Consider applying for your international driver's license.
Ferries are a solid option for crossing water. They are usually cheaper than another plane ticket, with better food.

, If you plan to travel with your pets, look at the rules and regulations for traveling with them to keep them out of quarantine. This generally includes a certificate of health from your vet, making sure that rabies vaccines are up to date, having them microchipped, and even a certificate of health from your local government office, such as the Department of Agriculture in the U.S.

"
"
Make a list a few weeks before the trip.,
Pack efficiently.,
Research airline regulations for what you can pack.,
Consider leaving basic toiletries behind.",How to Travel Abroad3," The list should include everything you are going to take with you. You can put these items into separate columns under what bag they are going in. If you don't have everything you need, write it down then buy it when you are shopping, this way you can prepare everything so you are organised.


If you are still struggling with what to pack, you can find an online rough guide with the essentials and basics. When you are all packed, take out you passport and any other travelling documents and keep them with you in a separate bag with your purse and phone, so it all stays together.

, No matter how you're traveling, extra bags and unnecessary things will weigh you down. As travel writer Rick Steves says, ""You can't travel happy, heavy, and cheap. Pick two.""


A few classic pieces that are easily mixed and matched and a knowledge of how to use the local laundromat can save you money on overweight baggage fees.
Know the common dress codes for your destination. For example, if you're visiting the Vatican, women will need their shoulders covered.

, If you're flying, you don't want to exceed the maximum weight. Extra or overweight bags often cost more money, and most airlines don't allow carry-on bags over a certain weight.

, You don't have to take everything you think you'll need. Nearly every country you'll visit will have basics like toothpaste, deodorant, soap, and contact solution, and you can't carry more than an three ounces of any liquid in carry on luggage, anyway. Carry copies of your prescriptions in case you run out.

Take a fly over.,
Get a flight that lands on Antarctica.,
Investigate fly-cruise options.,
Remember bad weather can ruin your plans.",How to Travel to Antarctica2," Probably the most straight-forward way to see Antarctica is from above. You can book yourself on a sightseeing flight over Antarctica which enables you to see its great white landscape from the comfort of a plane. Taking a sightseeing flight is a good option for day-trippers who want to spend a few hours over Antarctica and get back the same day. You can enjoy the views while Antarctica experts give talks on the plane and you are served food and drink.Australia is now the only place you can take these flights from.You need to plan ahead if you want to do this and book early.
If you want to get up and close and see the wildlife this is not the choice for you.
Depending on your seats, tickets will cost anything from $1,000 to $8,000., If you want to touch down on Antarctica, there are a number of companies that offer this service, leaving from a variety of places. Where you choose to go from will depend on the rest of your trip, so think about whether it would be better to travel from Australia, Chile, South Africa or Argentina and fully investigate the schedules from each place. Bear in mind that flights to Antarctica are much less frequent and less predictable than ordinary flights.Some adventure holiday companies have deals which involve landing on Antarctica and skiing, camping and climbing.You can fly to King George Island from Punta Arenas in Chile and stay overnight at a camp there for tourists., Another option is a fly-cruise package, which cuts down the time spent on a ship (avoiding the notoriously rough Drake Passage), but still enables you to get a close-up view of the landscape and wildlife. You can fly to King George Island, and then get aboard a ship which will take you around the area..


This could be a good option if you want to see the ice and wildlife up close, but don’t want to spend so much time travelling on board a cruise ship. But it won’t be any cheaper.
Expect to pay something in the region of $10,000 to $14,000 for a two-week trip., Be aware that flights are subject to cancellations due to weather and other safety issues. This is true for any flight, but the extreme conditions on the bottom of the world make this a more frequent occurrence. The best approach to assessing flight options is to read guidebooks written specifically for Antarctica, or check specialist websites, as the details change yearly depending on availability and interest.

"
"
Choose the right time to visit.,
Expect a large hole in your budget.,
Understand the health and safety issues.,
Respect the fragility of the Antarctic environment.,
Enjoy your trip of a lifetime.",How to Travel to Antarctica3," Antarctica's tour season covers about five months, mostly over the Southern Hemisphere summer (November to March).All other times of the year are extremely cold, dark, and the pack ice freezes out a long way. Be aware that while there will be less people around later in the season, much of the wildlife will already have left and headed out to sea. During these months, some of the things you can expect include:


During November, the pack ice starts to break up and it's mating season for the penguins and other birds.
During December and January, the penguin chicks hatch and are fed and nurtured in the breeding grounds.
During February and March, the penguin chicks fledge, the adult penguins molt, and the whales are easy to spot., This is one travel destination where budget travel is not much of an option unless you're hired to work hard. At a minimum, you will probably be facing at least US$5,000 and that is for the bare necessities and not necessarily the best seating or opportunities.


It is possible to get cheap last minute deals with cruise ships in places like Ushuaia in Argentina. You need to be in town, flexible, and able to set off straight away. This is a risky option, but if it works you could save quite a lot of money.If you don't want to visit as a tourist, think of other options, such as joining a government expedition to Antarctica. For this, you'll likely need suitable technical, scientific, medical, or other relevant skills like cooking for a large group. You will also need to be considered to have a suitable background for government employment.Another possibility is to travel as an invited part of a crew. Some people get asked to come along as journalists, photographers, artists, etc., and their trip is covered by whoever invited or sent them along. Again, this will depend on your skills.

, The Antarctic environment is dangerous for human beings. The weather can deteriorate rapidly and it is always cold, even in the summertime (highs in the summer along the coast generally range from 41-56°F). There are dangers such as crevasses on ice fields and glaciers and fire hazards are high in the very dry environment, so handling anything flammable must be done with care.


Read up on the gear and clothing you need. You will definitely need excellent waterproof clothing! Your cruise ship will most likely have things to hire if you don’t have them, but they might not be a great fit.There are no vaccination requirements for Antarctica but you should be fit and in good health because medical treatment will be basic and spread thin among all your passengers. Any medical conditions that you do have should be detailed by your doctor in letter form, especially if you need to bring along medication.

, The Antarctic environment is fragile and apart from expeditions, bases, and some tourists, there has been little human change. Wildlife remains unafraid of humans because of the lack of long-term negative interaction. It is important to respect the pristine nature of Antarctica and to ensure that tourism doesn't have a negative impact. There are Visitor Guidelines adopted under the Antarctic Treaty that regulate visitors' actions at Antarctica and it is worth reading them as part of your preparation for the visit. Some of the basics to keep in mind include:


Don't go too near wildlife and don't do anything to disturb wildlife.
Don't litter.
Don't deface anything – all human-built structures have historical value and many huts, etc., have heritage listings. Do not engrave anything into rocks or other land features.

Take photos and nothing else. Leave all eggs, shells, plants, rocks, fossils, soil, etc., where they are.

, This is one of those trips that people who take it can never forget or stop talking about. If you love pristine beauty, amazing sights, incredible wildlife opportunities, and you don't mind a bit of cold, this might be the perfect trip that will create a lifetime memory.

Take off your shoes while inside the house.,
Be modest.,
Show respect for elders.,
Bring a gift, preferably food, when you're a guest at someone's house.,
Respect religion.,
Ask permission before photographing or video recording anyone.",How to Show Proper Respect While in Samoa," This is a must!;
, Samoa is tropical, but it's not anything-goes. Avoid public displays of affection, and dress modestly.


Nude or topless (for women) sunbathing is discouraged or prohibited, and bikinis and other skimpy attire is frowned upon in villages. In formal situations, such as in church, it's generally preferred that women wear a lavalava (a sarong-like garment) instead of shorts or pants.
Sit down with your legs crossed when around others in a ""fale samoa."" If your legs get tired while you're sitting, and you need to uncross them, cover them with a mat or face them away from everyone else. Exercise care to not point your feet at others while you are seated.

,


Never talk to the elders while standing up. It's customary to talk to them while sitting down, and if they're sitting on a chair, squat or kneel down to talk to them. Even if you're not talking to an elder directly, you should not stand if you are in a room where an elder is seated.
Say ""tulou,"" which means excuse me, when you pass someone older than you if they're sitting on the floor or in a chair.

, It's also proper to offer a meal to your house guests.

, Most Samoans are Christians, and most are very religious.


Respect the evening prayer curfew. The curfew usually lasts 10-20 minutes sometime between 6-7 in the evening. The blowing of a conch shell or the ringing of a bell often mark its beginning and end. Avoid traveling during the curfew, and be extra quiet.
Respect Sundays. Be aware that most stores will be closed on Sundays, so stock up on what you need. Travel slowly through villages on Sundays, and generally be quiet and respectful. Take it easy.

, Many people will be happy to let you take their picture, but be sure to ask first, and respect the wishes of those who don't wish to be photographed.

Find out if the horses reside at the ranch full time or if they are rented.,
Inquire about rider/horse ratio on the ranch you are hoping to vacation at.,
Select a vacation ranch with riding group sizes that meet your pace, especially if you have children.,
Evaluate the safety precautions at each ranch you look into.,
Choose a ranch for an authentic ranch experience.",How to Choose a Vacation Ranch," Doing so will help you determine which vacation ranch you can afford. They are all different and offer a variety of activities, so determining what exactly you want to do while you are at the ranch will also help you with your choice.;
, The location of vacation ranches and their terrains vary significantly, so make sure that you take that into account when you select a ranch. You don't want to pick a ranch with terrain so rocky you cannot ride safely, especially if you have children or you are a novice rider. Your choices include mountainous areas versus the plains. The climate you prefer would also make a difference in your overall experience, for example, some people prefer a ranch experience in a desert location, whereas others prefer horseback riding on the beach. Where some ranches offer an assortment of diverse terrain with quiet trails and scenic views, others are limited to less luxurious trails. Additionally, where some ranches are in remote locations, others are close to civilization, highways and noise. You need to take all of these factors into consideration when selecting a vacation ranch that is right for you and your family.

, If they are passionate about riding, show gentle compassion for their horses, and ride often; or if the ranch is family owned with those same attributes, they will likely offer a vacation program that is authentic, personable and consistent.

, The answer should be a determining factor when selecting vacation horse ranches. Resident horses are familiar with the location and the ranchers; in the same token, ranchers are familiar with the horses and their temperaments and capabilities. A rancher can better match you with a horse if he knows the horse, and he cannot know a rented horse, because it takes much more than 1 season to get to know a horse. Additionally, a ranch with a variety of horse breeds in residence can match you with the best horse for your riding level.

, Anything less than 2 horses per veteran rider will likely leave the horse exhausted before the season ends.

, If you have a preference to trotting, check what the ranch allows before making a final decision. You don't want to be stuck at a facility that takes large groups out on the trail and doesn't allow more than a walk. You could also opt for a ranch that tries to enhance each person's riding experience by offering diverse riding groups. These groups are customized to meet the individual's needs, and riders are matched to horses by ability.

, When calling ranches, ask the owner about how they match riders to horses and whether riders receive instruction on handling their horse. Ask too about the pace of rides and the experience and qualifications of ride leaders. Go further by quizzing ranch owners to summarize their safety policy; doing so will prompt you to ask further questions.

, If you are looking for the real western experience, select a ranch with working cattle. Some ranches allow guests to partake in team penning or sorting, but doing so may depend on your riding abilities.

There's a tremendous amount of flexibility in this genre of gifts as well: anything from a bar set for the would-be mixologist to hiking boots for the amateur outdoorsman. Disabuse yourself that the valentine's gift is a certain sort of gift: in recent decades, it's become as versatile as the Christmas or birthday present.


For the well-kempt man in your life, consider an upscale grooming set. Try prodding for brand preferences from your valentine. Make sure it's something he's interested in, or else grooming materials might send the wrong message.
If your valentine in a serious audiophile, try going in for some quality headphones. Something so regularly used is a gift that will be cherished often.
For your lady valentine, find out what purse or wallet she's pined after and make that your gift. Know this may not come cheap, however.
Alcohol is a solid choice for the valentine who's also a connoisseur. Find out their particular poison and order them a tasting set. This has an added benefit of something you could do together.
Playful coupons are always a unique mainstay. Traditionally, these will be bawdy and intimate coupons offering time set aside for x, y, and z. It can be anything from breakfast in bed to whatever bedroom activity your valentine favors the most.;
, No longer restricted to female valentines, anyone and everyone likes to look good these days. The easiest to shop for will be accessories, but if you know your valentine well, you can go in on the bigger items like tops and coats. More than something they can use, it's something they can show off. Your name will come up whenever they're asked about it.


Try a watch. For either sex a watch is a tasteful gift which is always in style. Hopefully you'll have some sense of your valentine's style; there's a lot of good quality, reasonably-priced choices on the market.
Go for a scarf. Most likely a gift for a woman, though men have begun to wear scarves more and more in recent years. If you live somewhere plagued by cold weather, go for a high-quality scarf to impress your valentine. Make sure it's somewhat flashy or catches the eye, as a simple scarf tends to fall flat as a gift.
Consider shoes or slippers. Slippers especially make for a cute thought if you know your valentine suffers from cold floors. On the more expensive side, shoes are a long-lasting and welcome addition to any valentine's wardrobe.
If you've no clue, buy a gift certificate. Follow it up with an offer to go shopping with them to make it an activity you do together, instead of gifting them the errand of visiting a store., Stuff is great, but especially as people age they tend to take care of the stuff they'd like themselves. Valentine's day especially possesses a serious tradition of specific stuff-giving: flowers, chocolates, teddy bear, and card. Think about giving them something to do and not just something to have.


Gifts which encourage you and your valentine to spend time together are ideal. Naturally this will depend on the message you're trying to convey, but nothing accentuates the romance of a valentine's gift like the ability to share it with one another.
If you and your valentine are big foodies, one classic choice is to seek out cooking classes that you can take together.
Think about a weekend away if you can spare the time and the money. Make a gift of the weekend and devote whatever you do to your valentine's desires and interests.
Concert tickets are another simple (though potentially costly) option for something to do together. Try and find out if there's a show coming soon that they're hoping to see., Whether it's interests broad or specific, try to begin to get a sense of your valentine's interests, hobbies, hopes and desires. This is simple enough if they're already a significant other of yours--a wife, or a long-term boyfriend. If it's someone a little less known to you, there's a little more difficulty in this step.


Remember to be subtle. It's pretty obvious when you're being prodded for gift ideas under the guise of playful conversation. If your valentine is established in your life, this might actually be a coy way of prefacing your gift. But if it's a good looking co-worker or a fellow student, subtlety is key.
Don't be afraid to ask around. Try to inquire with friends or family of your valentine--hopefully people you trust to keep your gift-giving a secret.
Ease it into conversation. Avoid just asking your crush ""what are your favorite things?"" Attempt to have it arise organically in conversation, coming at the question sideways:

Try asking what they did this weekend, to get a sense of their preferred activities.
Have curious follow-up questions: ""That mountain bike trail sounds really great; do you do a lot of outdoors stuff?



, If they like cooking, don't just get them a cookbook. If they're big into video games, don't just buy the latest title. Think outside the box when crafting gift ideas to suit their interests. If they like cooking, try buying a dinner at the chef's table of an upscale restaurant. If it's video games, try making faux-coupons for time set aside to game together.


A good rule of thumb is to not to try and buy them what they would buy themselves, but buy them what they never even thought they wanted.

, As a general rule for gift-giving, you should look to exhaust your options. Don't kick yourself a week after February 14th when you've found the perfect gift too late. Try and find out where you valentine shops when they've got money to spare, or what they buy when it's just purely for fun.


If you're looking for the active gift, browse local educational and hobby catalogs for classes and events that your valentine might find enjoyable. In this case, however, be sure it's something you know they'll enjoy. An undesirable gift is pretty bad, but when it takes up a whole day it might be pretty frustrating.
If you decide to take the arts-and-crafts route and avoid the shopping, be sure to really make it good. Serious thought and work ought to go into these sorts of gifts to make sure they don't appear last minute or thrown-together.

, What is it you're trying to say? If it's a significant other, it might be that you want them to know how much you love spending time together. If it's a crush from afar, maybe you'd like them to know that you'd love to get to know them better. In any case, if you're looking to ""say what you mean"" as a part of your Valentine's Day present, it's necessary to know what you'd like to say.

, A set of sexy lingerie doesn't really reflect how much you enjoy spending time with another person. A box of chocolate and a stuffed teddy hardly say ""I'd like to get to know you better,"" or really anything at all. Beyond merely selecting the gift, ensuring that it matches whatever message you'd like to get across is the greatest obstacle to giving gifts that say what you mean.Avoid under- or over-giving. Match the gift to the current level of commitment you've made with your valentine. Don't rent a cabin for the weekend as a gift to the cute girl at work. Don't just buy a season of their favorite television show if you're hoping to say ""thanks for all the decades together.""
This is really a more important step for those approaching valentines who are more unknown--the crushes and the loves-from-afar. Never trap someone like this in a gift like an outing (unless it's very brief) or a scheduled event. For desirable acquaintances, it's usually a stronger choice to impress them with the most unique possible thing that matches their interests.

, While the gift itself should say quite a bit, ""saying what you mean"" will most likely take place in the details, such as in an attached card. In most instances, there's no reason why it can't be made plain in the card (especially with your significant other). However, if your valentine is less known to you, be sure to be a little artful in your presentation.


Consider omitting the card if it's only an acquaintance. In this case, try to make the gift-giving a little more personal. If it's a crush of yours it might even be a surprise, so try sticking around and explaining in your own words why you thought they deserved a gift. This doesn't have to be anymore complicated than just saying ""I'd love to get to know you better.""
Prepare to be misunderstood. Don't expect the worst, but know how to explain yourself, especially if your gift is a little out-there., The final and most obvious step is to simply give the gift. In classic style, try not to make a big deal out of it. Demure and deny when it comes to questions like ""how did you think of this?"" or ""how did you know I wanted this?"" This is the greatest pleasure in a gift well-gifted; take time to assure them it was ""no trouble,"" or that ""it just came to you.""

, If you’re the type who imagines folks secretly pointing at you on the street and laughing at your single status, you’re spending way too much time measuring yourself against supposedly happy, snuggling couples. Remember: just because a person is partnered up on V-Day doesn’t necessarily mean that he or she is blissed out (or even remotely contented).

Invite someone out to dinner.,
Give gifts to your single friends.,
Celebrate anti Valentine’s Day as a couple.",How to Celebrate Anti Valentine's Day1," Why not throw a bash and limit it to people without a significant other? You could also include couples who are sick of the holiday (but not if they will ruin it with cuddling and other romantic overtures).


Hand out black roses, play singles games, and have people exchange gag gifts. You may have heard of divorce parties, so why not borrow from the concept on Valentine’s Day? Alternatively, have a theme that is pointedly not about Valentine's Day. For instance, a party with a color theme, Country Western, Marshmallow Appreciation Day....whatever.
Order a Valentine’s Day piñata, and let everyone take turns smacking it a time or two. Make sure there’s something fun inside. Have fun with the drinks. How about a blood orange mojito?Spend some time developing fun anti-Valentine’s Day invitations. You don’t have to avoid red or pink or little hearts. You just have to have the right slogans on them. Custom-order candy hearts with sarcastic phrases about love and Cupid.;
, Or, if you prefer, you could order anti-Valentine’s Day cupcakes. Give them out at work, to friends, or at a party you throw.


You can find funny but sarcastic cupcake or cake toppers online and in some party stores. For example, a broken glitter heart would work.
It’s all in the slogan. Be funny, but not too mean. Cupid is stupid, love hurts, or other phrases are harmless fun. There are many anti-Valentine’s Day cupcake recipes online. For example, some recommend creating a red licorice X on top of the cupcake.You could top the cake with black hearts or black roses. The color black is a great way to turn a red Valentine’s Day cake or party into an anti-Valentine’s Day message.

, This could be another single friend, a parent, or even a casual acquaintance you’d like to get to know better.


You could enjoy a Valentine’s Day special with someone who is not a romantic partner. Or you could see if any restaurants (or taverns) offer anti-Valentine’s day events or dinners. Some do. There's no reason you can't spend Valentine's Day with someone you love in a family sense.
Reach out to someone you know is lonely. Send them a bouquet or invite them over for dinner. There's power in numbers!
Some more offbeat ideas include dressing up your pet for a dinner at home. You could even put a bow on the cat or dog., You may discover you’re not alone. Half the world seems on cloud nine on Valentine’s Day, but everyone else is down in the dumps or just hates the commercialism and expectations of the day.


Lift up someone else’s spirits with gifts for all your single friends. You can find anti-Valentine’s Day mugs and T-shirts online.Wear the anti-Valentine’s Day T-shirts out as a group, like you might at a bachelorette or bachelor’s day party. You can also purchase anti-Valentine’s Day cards online and in some stores.
You can find many customized anti-Valentine’s items online, and you can even find full relationship breakup kits for purchase., Don’t assume only singletons hate Valentine’s Day. Many people are sick of the holiday.


Maybe your significant other is one of those people. You could send him or her a sarcastic anti-Valentine’s Day card.Throw a couple’s anti-Valentine’s Day party for other couples and singles, who hate the holiday or are just sick of the glittery pink mush it conveys.
Be aware though that some people really do care about Valentine’s Day. If your partner is one of these people, why let your own sarcasm cause hurt feelings? Suck it up, and be nice. Appreciating other people’s feelings can go a long way, and a lot of people just want to be remembered on Valentine’s Day somehow.

Play the right music.,
Enjoy a staycation.,
Do something that’s not commercial.",How to Celebrate Anti Valentine's Day2," You’re going to feel better if you play music with an anti-Valentine’s Day vibe. This is true if you’re sitting at home or if you’re hosting a party.


Many sites online have lists of anti-Valentine’s Day songs. You don’t have to spend the day listing to romantic mush on the radio.Some possibilities include Tainted Love by Soft Cell, You Oughta Know by Alanis Morissette, What’s Love Got to Do With it by Tina Turner, Since You’ve been Gone by Kelly Clarkson, I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, No Action by Elvis Costelllo, and It’s My Life by Bon Jovi.It’s a good idea to choose songs that are about surviving or living life your own way.

Pick a hotel with a spa or at least a hot tub. Treat yourself to a massage or a facial. Spend the night reading a great book or watching movies on the hotel television.
Take a long, hot bubble bath inside the hotel. This isn’t the time to feel sorry for yourself. It’s the time to make sure you take care of yourself.
Order room service and, if you’re on one, skip the diet for the day! Pamper yourself in a way you can’t do at home with pets, bills, and other stresses.

, One of the biggest raps on Valentine’s Day is that the romance has been lost in the rush toward commercialism anyway.


Go on a spiritual pilgrimage or spend the weekend away at the spa. Do something that helps create a stronger inner you.
Take a cultural trip somewhere, either alone or with a friend. Explore the sites and sounds of a locale you’ve always wanted to visit.
Visit someone else who’s lonely, perhaps a grandparent, or, if you don’t have one living, just go to a nursing home and spend some time with the older folks there. They will appreciate the attention.

It depends why and how it ended of course, and how long ago, and whether they’ve already got someone else new.
Be aware that reaching out into the past can create the potential for more heartbreak. But if there’s someone from long ago you’ve been thinking about, or some regret you have, why not express it?
You might be surprised and learn that the person will welcome the contact. You could also send something to a secret crush.

, If you’ve recently broken up with someone, and that’s why you’re alone on Valentine’s Day, buy yourself a breakup gift.


It could be a piece of jewelry you’ve always wanted, a day at the spa, a trip somewhere you’ve always wanted to go, or a new purse.

Wrap the gift, and go the whole nine yards. You’re basically treating yourself. Look at the positives. You know better than anyone else does what you want most anyway.

, Have a movie or TV series marathon. Pick something without a romantic theme.


Alternatively, watch movies with lots of romance such as Titanic; Encourage your guests to make snarky comments during it.
Use a streaming service to binge watch that show that everyone else is always saying they're addicted to.
You could also go to the movies. That's a good way to distract yourself, but, be aware, you might run into couples having a date night.

Travel.",How to Plan the Perfect Valentine's Day for Your Husband1," Dinner out at a restaurant is a classic Valentine's tradition However, you may find most restaurants overbooked or overpriced for that very reason. If you want to take him out to eat, make reservations as far in advance as you can. Plan to eat at home, or pack a romantic picnic if the weather permits.


Hire a professional chef or a talented single friend to cook the two of you a romantic dinner at home.
If one of you works on Valentine's day, consider meeting up for a brief lunch. It will be too rushed to constitute the main event of your day, but it is a romantic gesture.
Breakfast in bed is another classic romantic gesture. If your partner doesn't like eating in bed, just popping out of bed before him and having it ready by the time he gets up is a kind act.
If your husband really loves cooking, give him the gift of appreciation. Tell him you're dying to eat a home-cooked meal, maybe make a special request for something you think he could make, then sit back and watch him cook.
Cooking together can also be romantic. If you guys can stand a little cheese, buy matching aprons.
If you're feeling foxy, consider cooking in only aprons.
Timing is everything. If you are planning a heavy meal at home or at a restaurant, eat late. Get your romantic time together before you head out, as you may be too full and sleepy after a large meal to enjoy one another's company afterward.;
, If you and your partner drink alcohol, drink something nicer than usual on this occasion. Get a bottle of nice wine, or buy a growler from a local beer distributor. Buy ingredients to replicate a kind of cocktail you both enjoy, and mix it up as a surprise.


Design a new cocktail. If you're crafty, make a custom cocktail using flavors your husband enjoys. If you plan a week ahead, you can make a custom liqueur for the special drink.Give your cocktail a personalized name, or tell him it's an aphrodisiac.
Beer doesn't have to feel casual or inelegant. Opt for a locally brewed beer with a high alcohol content, and serve it in champagne flutes or wine glasses.Red wine is a classic romantic drink for a reason. All alcohol could be considered an aphrodisiac, but red wine is even more so., Valentine's Day doesn't have to be all dinner and swooning. If you and your husband are outdoorsy, consider taking a hike, hitting a rock-climbing gym, or taking an excursion on a boat. If you enjoy dancing together, go dancing.


Sign up for a one-off class and learn a new kind of couple's dance.
If you're already expert ballroom dancers, consider a romantic team activity, like AcroYoga or a couples-oriented contact improv class.
Hike somewhere gorgeous and have a picnic.
If your February's snowy, go ice skating or sledding together, or take a trip to a ski lodge.

, Being in a new place will make your special day all the more special. Book a weekend trip to a nearby town, or find a cheap flight to a totally foreign place. Make the journey part of the celebration. Pack media you can enjoy together, and make pit stops in interesting places.


Consider taking a long train ride together instead of flying or driving. You can watch romantic movies with headphones in and eat a delicious meal that you pack.
Sleep in a hotel. Even if you can't afford a trip out of town, consider booking a room in a hotel for the night. Staying in your town doesn't mean you have to follow your ordinary routine.
Take a trip to an activity you can enjoy together. Book a day visit to a spa, or camp at some natural hot springs.

Decorate or go to a beautiful place.,
Smell like food.,
Play upbeat music.,
Be alone.",How to Plan the Perfect Valentine's Day for Your Husband2," No matter the kind of date you plan, wearing something new, or something he especially loves, will help the day feel special. If you wear dresses, try a slinky dress, or a curve-hugging skirt. If you wear suits, wear a well-tailored suit and an open collared shirt. Opt for fabric that feels good to the touch, like silk or velvet. If you aren't worried about matching the décor, wear red.Consider underwear. Wearing lingerie under your beautiful outfit will make every step of dressing and undressing a Valentine's day activity. Think sheer panties or boxer briefs, thigh highs, a garter belt, a thong, or a bustier.
Dress him up too. If your husband is the kind of guy who likes to be dressed up, embrace that. Buy him something you know he wants, or something you think he'd look especially hot in.
The same ideas that work for you work for him. You can get him clothes to show off, or something more intimate to wear just for you. If you're going hiking for Valentine's day, you can even get him some attractive exercise wear, like shiny bike shorts or a mesh tank top.
If your husband prefers feeling in control of his own outfit, plan ahead. Tell him you want to buy him something special, and look around online together till you find the right thing.

, The place you'll be spending time together should be beautiful. You might go to an elegant restaurant, take a hike at sunrise, or walk the beach at sunset. Depending on your aesthetic, you and your husband might enjoy a stroll through a community garden, a visit to an art-deco movie theater, or a visit to a graffitied canal.


If you are decorating at home, put out clean tablecloths in dark or warm colors. Stick some candles in candle holders or old wine bottles, or make floating candles.
Clean up. A mess is depressing, and draping it with streamers is like giving up. If you're celebrating at home, tidy your home. Put away all evidence of work.
Put flowers in a vase, and drop petals on the tablecloth or into the bowl of floating candles.
Food might provide all the scent you need, but buying fragrant flowers or burning incense can also contribute to the atmosphere.

, Certain odors seem to increase male sexual arousal. Strangely, most of them can be found in food.The smell of pumpkin pie and lavender together is hugely effective, followed by a doughnut/black licorice combination. The scent of oranges, lavender, cola, lily of the valley, buttered popcorn, vanilla, and musk are all potent stimulants as well.


Wear perfume with notes of lavender, orange, musk, or lily of the valley.
Bake a pumpkin pie or tart with a lavender-herbed butter crust. Take it out of the oven right before dinner so the house is full of the smell.
Make rum-and-coke cocktails and drink them with a black liquorice straw.

, Though it may be tempting to go full Beethoven on Valentine's day, studies show that upbeat music has a positive effect on men's arousal, while music that invokes a negative mood has a dampening effect.Play jazz, classical, or hip hop that has a positive vibe.


Keep the volume low so you can talk.

, If you and your husband have children, get a babysitter and get out of the house. If you want to be at home, ask a family member to watch the kids, or arrange a sleepover. If you live with housemates or other family members and you can't shoo them away for the evening, set up your date in your room rather than in the kitchen.

Determine the kind of gift your husband will find meaningful.,
Fulfill a fantasy.,
Plan, but include surprises.",How to Plan the Perfect Valentine's Day for Your Husband3," When you give someone a present, you're saying something to that person. What do you want to say to your husband with his V-Day gift? ""I love you"" is easy to say. ""I love you, and I support your commitment to running every weekend"" is best said with new running shoes.


Ask yourself if he would most enjoy a public declaration of love, a thoughtful homemade gift, a perfectly practical gift, or a gift that speaks to something you admire about him.
Don't forget the Valentine's Day standbys. Does your husband like chocolate? Flowers? Red wine? Champagne? Woo him with classic gestures.

, Think of something you always wanted to experience, but never got to do. Ask your husband about his fantasies. If he's shy or says he doesn't have any, don't give up. Share your fantasy, and let him know that you are open to hearing about his. You can do this weeks before Valentine's Day, or you can initiate the conversation the day of.


Be prepared for the possibility that he may have fantasies you find gross or boring. Listen non-judgmentally, and don't react too quickly.
You don't have to fulfill a fantasy just because you know about it. However, talking about it gives you the opportunity to consider it.
If you do decide to fulfill one another's fantasies, talk about it thoroughly beforehand. Don't spring a scenario on him without his consent!
Determine a safe word for new erotic pursuits. If you or he feels uncomfortable at any point, say the word!

, A week or two beforehand, let your husband know that you are planning Valentine's Day so that he doesn't make conflicting plans. If he does have ideas, coordinate with him. You can both be in charge of part of the festivities.


However, don't tell him every step of your design. Some elements—a gift, a special dessert, etc—should be a surprise.
Surprises are more stimulating than pleasures that have been planned."

Decide how much money you are willing to spend on a solitaire ring.,
Decide what finger you want your girl to wear your gift.,
Decide of what material you want to buy a solitaire ring.,
Design.",How to Buy Solitaire Rings for Valentine's Day," From this, you can start selecting other features of a ring.;
, Psychologists say that depending on which finger a person wears a ring on, they can judge the nature of an individual. For example, a ring on a little finger accompanies a creative person, as well as reports of a girl’s wayward, original and even capricious nature. Speaking of an index finger, psychologists call it ""the finger of power"". It is not surprising, because many politicians and monarchs graced their index fingers with fine rings. Middle finger, from the point of view of psychology, is responsible for beauty.

, When you make a decision about metal (yellow gold, white gold, black hills gold, and platinum) of which you are planning to buy a ring, you need to decide what color in this case would be optimal. Color choice often depends on individual taste and preferences, the colors of the existing jewelry, fashion trends, etc.


Yellow golden ring - a classic. It’s very popular with brides and grooms. White gold is popular among the young. It looks stylish and modern. Platinum is a durable metal, symbol of eternal and enduring love. In addition, platinum rings are not scratched and they are the most expensive. There are also rings which are made of combination o different metals.If you need a ring in yellow then you need to select between gold 585 and gold 750. Gold 585 costs less than gold 750. Besides, it is also harder. But the yellow color is not as bright as that of gold 750.
If you want white metal, then it will be more difficult to choose. Although platinum and white gold are very similar to each other, they are still different. Platinum is more expensive, a little bit softer and more malleable than white gold while white gold is very strong and a little scratched, but it has a brownish or yellowish color, which eliminates the application of rhodium. Over time, coverage goes, but it can be restored easily, giving thus a completely new type of product.
Rhodium is the brightest and shiniest metal of the platinum group. Rhodium is harder and whiter than platinum, and does not wear out as quickly as the gold plating. Because of this it is often used to coat gold and platinum jewelry.

, As to the design, choose a product of your girl’s taste and preference. It all depends on her status, character, image, as well as lifestyle. Ornaments are divided into classic and evening wear. Among other precious stones diamonds remain unwavering popularity, thanks to the excellent quality of cut and nobility - white, one-off, yellow, gold, etc. The elegance and beauty of nothing can compare to a diamond ring. As the saying goes, girl's best friends are diamonds. No wonder, because diamond is one of the most valuable and precious stones. Jewelers love to use these stones to encase rings, pendants, necklaces, bracelets. It’s better to buy a ring with tone stone in a product, but a little more, even if it is not very clean, than several small ones.

Qatar is home to 840,000 people and sits on the world’s third-largest oil reserves. Arabic is the official language, though English is widely used. Qatar is serviced by its national air carrier, Qatar Airways, plus several other major airlines.;
, Qatar is a desert nation with summer temperatures often exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) with intermittent humidity that can reach 90%. Winters are milder, making November through March the more popular time of year to visit. As a necessity, most buildings are equipped with air conditioning and people rarely spend time outdoors. Nonetheless, it is good to stock up on sunscreen and dress in layers—the recommended desert attire—to protect from the sun and sand but keep warm during cool nights.

, According to the U.S. Department of State, Qatar has a low crime rate and violence is rare, making it one of the safer places to visit in the Middle East. A lack of international disputes translates to fewer security threats as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a typhoid vaccination for anyone traveling to the Middle East.

, Doha is the capital of Qatar and also the nation’s largest city and home to many of its attractions. This rapidly developing metropolitan is the home of the Al-Jazeera satellite TV channel and plays host to the Doha Tribeca Film Festival, a festival founded in part by the prestigious Tribeca Film Festival in New York, each October.

, Whether or not you actually want to buy any gold, the souq (marketplace) is a great place to experience a longstanding tradition and get a taste of a pre-modern Doha.

, The Khor Al-Adaid, also known as the Inland Sea, is a stretch of water surrounded by sand dunes that offers stunning scenery. Gulf Adventures offers tours to the area that include a barbecue and overnight stay. Also available are “dune bashing” rides--a high-speed trek across towering dunes in an off-road vehicle.

, Qatar is among a cluster of Gulf nations that are growing in tourism and cultural exports. Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates are both nearby and are known for their luxury hotels, dramatic skylines and 5-star dining. There are daily buses available to Jordan, Syria, Bahrain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi from Qatar, but be sure to acquire a transit visa for Saudi Arabia ahead of time.

Plan at least one surprise.,
Be frivolously juvenile again.,
Focus on her.,
Think back on your memories together.,
Try a big, romantic gesture.,
Proclaim your love to the world.,
Tell her all day that she’s beautiful.,
Spend time with her.",How to Plan the Perfect Valentine's Day for Your Wife," It's always nice to have your expectations surpassed. This is why you must plan at least one surprise that you know she wouldn't expect in a million thoughts. Some surprise ideas include:


Mail a handwritten letter and a card the day before (or in as much time ahead as needed to reach the mailbox). Postage is so romantic, simply because so few people use it to send messages now. Insert a handwritten poem as well as your dedication and letter.






Show up with a cup of chocolate mousse in bed as a breakfast appetizer. Beginning the day with something sweet sets the perfect tone for the rest of the day.
Text her a poem. A love sonnet is great, but lyrics to a love ballad from her favorite era works just as well. You can be more imaginative than just taking her out to dinner in the evening, you know you can.






Fruit can be a sweet gift for your beloved wife in place of the usual flowers, provided it has had some effort put into it.






Have a few small gifts piled up at the foot of the bed or arranged on the breakfast tray, consisting of simple joys that you know she likes. Choose things like seeds for growing flowers this coming spring, a new release from a favorite author, a watercolor paint set or vouchers for a massage at her favorite beauty parlor.

, Hey, you're spending a day with a wonderful woman. It's worth throwing some caution aside. Take her out to dessert, and if she can't decide between two desserts, order them both. Try to win her a stuffed animal from the arcade, or buy her a bouquet of balloons big enough to lift a small child off the ground. Take her back to her childhood for a bit of fun, just so that she feels worth it.

, In the morning, have her favorite breakfast with her. In the evening, rent the movie she wants to see. Sit through it and act happy; your suffering will pay off in her gratitude for your fortitude! If you buy chocolates or flowers, make sure they’re her favorite; bonus points if they're ones she rarely has because of their price and exclusivity.


She will adore you if you learn the proper way to put flowers in a vase. Bring home a bouquet and tell her to sit down and talk about her day while you put your new skill to work. She'll be impressed at your handiwork and ability to listen at the same time.

, What did you do when you were just starting out? If you went to Wendy’s all the time, show up at the door with two ""Frosties"" and the first movie you saw together.

, Visit somewhere out of a book or movie she likes. Take her somewhere cold where she has to wear gloves, then pull off one glove at a time and kiss every finger tip (she will melt at this gesture). Bring home so many flowers it looks like you bought out the flower stand, or pick a bouquet of wild flowers. Wash her hair for her or serenade her––it’s okay to use a stereo.

, Or at least to a few people. Send her flowers at work so everyone can see, or stop her in the middle of the crowd and kiss her. Write your initials in sidewalk chalk. Hire a mariachi band to play outside her window or office.

, Buy her a beautiful vintage hand-held mirror and say a woman so lovely deserves to look at herself in a mirror as delicately crafted as she is.

, Set your alarm early and hold her close in the morning. If she has to go somewhere, walk her out to her car just to open the door. Go rollerblading together. Show up at school to pick up the kids with her. Slow dance to jazz love songs or just sing to her and dance under the stars. Do things that revive the magic in your romance.

If you are heading out into the Wop Wops (New Zealand term for boondocks), never travel without telling someone where you headed and when you expect to arrive.;
, In New Zealand, vehicles drive on the left, unlike the US procedures. When walking, look both ways when crossing the road and use controlled crossings where possible.


Don't dawdle on controlled pedestrian crossings. You won't have much time to cross, and frequently turning vehicles get a green light to turn while the pedestrian crossing light is still flashing red. Wear a helmet if you cycle, it's the law. Don't ride a quad bike on the public road.

, Tap water is safe to drink across New Zealand, unless expressly marked otherwise. Rivers, streams and lakes are not appropriate sources of drinking water, but can be utilised in emergencies if proper precautions are taken.


Purchased food is no more or less likely to give you food poisoning than food purchased in the US, UK or Australia, provided that you store and prepare it appropriately. There are many edible native plants in New Zealand and at the shore seafood can be harvested providing you obey local bylaws. If seafood from a beach is not fit for human consumption, this will be sign posted.

, There are no communicable diseases that the average traveller needs to worry about. Malaria is not present, and dengue fever or yellow fever shots and the like are not required.


If you have a weakened immune system, consult your doctor before travelling. All travellers over 16 need to consider the health risks of holiday romance.

, The sun is powerful in NZ, and you can be easily burnt on a cloudy day, even in early spring (September) and late Autumn (May).

, According to the Global Peace index, New Zealand is the third most peaceful country in the world. Murder is uncommon in New Zealand, but less serious crimes are common. Be aware of the risk of being mugged, having your pocket picked and having unattended belongings stolen in tourist destinations.


In rural areas, where there are few people around, it's not uncommon for 'gear' (such as fishing rods or backpacks) to be left by the owner while they hike off to do something else. This is risky and is discouraged, but since it does happen, it is suggestive of the common Kiwi attitude to crime in rural areas. If you see any gear left behind, leave it alone rather than stealing it; you don't want to be a criminal. Be sensible about not being a target for criminals.
There are also gangs in New Zealand. There are mostly motorcycle gangs, but gang violence is more common amongst rival gangs or gang members. Some gangs are criminal, but the crime is more commonly drug or theft related than anything else. Tourists are very infrequently victims of gang crime. You are far more likely to be injured in an RTC as a tourist than be the victim of gang violence.

, NZ beaches can have dangerous riptides and tidal surges. Only swim where it is safe to do so, and obey signage and any instructions from life guards. If it doubt, don't swim at all.

, Understand that the weather can change very rapidly in many of the valley and mountainous regions of New Zealand. Be prepared for these changes.


Always dress appropriately and carry warm clothing with you, unless you can guarantee that you will not get cold. Even experienced trampers get lost, so take care when tramping or hiking. Stick to the paths and tracks unless you are confident of your ability.

, Earthquakes occur in New Zealand.

, Train crossings may not be the same as you are used to so don't take any chances, especially with vehicles, around train tracks.

, Paths, tracks and roads can be at risk of rocks falling into them, especially in a valley. Obey signage, sometimes no stopping is advised for example, and listen and look for falling rocks or land slides., The only dangerous wild animals you are even slightly likely to encounter are wild pigs.


If you are in wild pig country, chances are you're hunting and the pigs have more to worry about than you. Stags are universally dangerous during rutting season. Take care around deer and be aware of the potential danger.
Some spiders in New Zealand bite, but none are fatal. Be aware that you could have a serious reaction to any spider bites if you happen to have an allergic reaction to it. Poison Oak does not commonly grow in New Zealand. While rain forest foliage can be dense, there are no plants that can seriously injure you in the course of a conventional hike. There are some thorny shrubs that can attach to clothes, skin or hair but they can be harmlessly removed as long as you do so carefully and even if you do get scratched, that'll be all it is, a scratch. Bats live in some parts of New Zealand, and they do not suck your blood. There are no snakes in New Zealand at all, venomous, poisonous or otherwise.

, The marathon doubles up along Kalanianaole Highway, so cheer on encouragement to those on the other side of the road. There is a lot of Aloha spirit and even if it's cheering on a Japanese participant, everyone has fun.

Decide where in Hawaii you will go by doing online research, sending away for travel brochures, talking to a travel agent, or reading a guidebook.,
Ride a helicopter over Waimea Canyon on the garden island of Kauai.,
Experience walking over volcanoes at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island for an adventure found few other places in the world.,
Visit Pearl Harbor on the island of Oahu; you can book sightseeing tours of the World War II Arizona monument online or check with your hotel's concierge for information.,
Inquire as to whether or not your hotel has laundry facilities so you'll know how many clothes to pack.,
Take lightweight clothes made of fabrics that breathe.,
Wear your brightest colors to stay cooler.,
Pack long pants and a warm shirt or light jacket if you intend to visit the mountains or volcanoes, or spend time outdoors at night.,
Include at least 2 bathing suits in your suitcase.,
Take the right shoes on your Hawaiian trip.

,
Wear comfortable walking shoes and take along a pair of flip flops or easy to slip-on sandals for the beach.

,
Bring a pair of hiking boots if you plan to hike or climb.,
Prepare for the sun by packing sunglasses and a hat, preferably broad-brimmed, which can help protect your head, neck, and face from sunburn.,
Take along a raincoat or umbrella for protection against occasional showers.,
Bring along a camera with plenty of film or memory cards.,
Remember your medication.,
Label your luggage outside and inside in the event it gets lost.,
Determine if your hotel provides bulky items such as hairdryers and irons in the room so you can leave these at home.

,
Take a backpack along, if a long hike is in your plans.",How to Prepare for a Trip to Hawaii," Hawaii has widely-varied terrains and sightseeing opportunities which you'll want to examine closely at the beginning of your trip planning process.


One of the most well-known beaches is Waikiki where you'll also find popular bars, restaurants, and shopping areas. Waikiki also offers experiences such as submarine tours and the Royal Luau.;
, Kauai is off the beaten path and a favorite destination of nature lovers.

, Here you can also snorkel, go horseback riding, and take helicopter tours.

, Oahu also offers scuba adventures, chances to swim with dolphins, and nature tours.

, If you can wash your clothes during your vacation, you will be able to pack less and travel lighter.

, Temperatures in Hawaii average from 70 to 85 degrees F (21 to 29 degrees C) year-round. Think about investing in easy-to-wash, wrinkle-free clothing to save time and energy.

, Dark clothes will absorb more sunlight than lighter, brighter-colored clothing.

, Temperatures can drop as you gain elevation. Dressing in layers will also help you handle changing temperatures on hikes in higher elevations or nighttime luaus on the beach.

, Visitors to Hawaii often spend much of their time on the beach or in the pool, so having more than 1 swimsuit ensures you always have one that is dry and ready to wear.


Tuck one into your backpack when out hiking so you'll be prepared for an impromptu dip should you come across one of the swimming holes and waterfalls often found along Hawaiian hiking trails.

,,, At the very least, have a pair of sturdy shoes with non-slip or gripping soles. Hawaii's high humidity and plentiful water can make trails wet and slippery. Water shoes with good gripping soles can be useful when you are hiking over streams and around waterfalls where rocks and logs can be slippery.

, Look for hats specifically designed for travel; you can bend and fold them for easier packing, yet they retain their shape when you put one on.

, It usually rains at least once a day in Hawaii, and although the showers typically don't last long, having a purse-sized umbrella or fold-up rain slicker could come in handy.

, Remember items like chargers for your camera, too, so you don't wind up with dead camera batteries and no way to document the rest of your trip.

, Keep it in labeled bottles so if you need a refill, it will be easier to get. If you have too many bottles that it makes packing them cumbersome, make a list of your medications, dosages, and your doctor's phone number to tuck into your wallet.

, Make sure you pack a change of clothing in your carry-on just in case your bags are lost or delayed by the airline.

,, Also a bag for the beach will help you keep all your items together when you venture out for a swim.

Plan your trip.,
Arrive at the bus stop no later than five minutes before the bus is timetabled to arrive.,
Hail the bus when it arrives at your stop.,
Either pay the appropriate fare, show the driver a ticket you have already purchased, or touch your GO card.,
Take a seat on the bus.,
Press the bell when the bus is approaching your stop to signal you want to get off there.,
When the bus stops, make your way to one of the doors and alight the bus.",How to Take a Bus in Brisbane," Translink manage all public transport in South East Queensland, and have information of routes, timetables, and service updates, as well as a journey planner on their website. You can also call for information from Translink on their call number 13 12 30, and can find printed timetables at places like libraries.


You will need to find out where the bus stop is, what bus routes you can take to your destination, what times the buses come, and how much money you will need in cash or on your GO card.;
, While at the stop, watch the road approaching the bus stop and look out for your bus arriving. Buses will have signs and numbers displaying where they are going such as 370 City via Valley to help you determine if the bus approaching is your bus. If you are not paying attention, do not assume that the bus driver will see you at the bus stop and stop for you. Many bus stops are serviced by multiple routes, and a driver will not automatically assume that you want their bus and drive past without picking you up., To hail the bus, stand next to the road at the bus stop sign, and extend your arm upwards, as if making a stop gesture, while looking at the bus. When the bus starts indicating to pull into the stop, move back from the road for your safety. If it is dark, try standing in light to help make yourself seen, or use a light such as your phone's screen or flashlight to help attract the driver's attention.


Once the bus has pulled up at the stop, and the doors open, check to see if anyone on the bus is moving to get off the bus and let them off first, before stepping onto the bus yourself.

,



If paying by cash, have your cash ready, and any concession cards, and tell the driver you would like a ticket, where you are going, and show them your concession cards, and the driver will print you a ticket. Prepaid services however do not sell tickets, so you will either have to have already bought a ticket elsewhere, or use a GO card.

If using a ticket you already have, show it to the driver so he can inspect it. The ticket will have on it what zones it can be used in, the date it to be used on, and the time it expires. If your ticket has expired, or you are not traveling in the zones on the ticket, you will need to purchase another ticket.

If using a GO card, touch the card to the circular pad on the card readers on either side of the door as you enter. There will be an audible beeping, a pair of green, orange, or red lights will flash, and a small screen will display a message. When it beeps flashes green or orange, it will display your current card balance. Your card has been read, and you can remove your card from the reader. If it beeps and flashes red, it may display several different messages. It may mean your card has not read properly because you did not hold it to the reader for long enough, or there was interference from another card or a mobile phone. It could also mean that the card has expired, been cancelled, or does not have enough credit on it to pay for your journey.

, If it is crowded and you have to stand, hang onto one of the grab rails or handles to secure yourself as the bus can move around on bumpy roads, or stop quickly in certain circumstances.


If you are disabled, pregnant, or elderly, and there are no seats available, you can request other passengers stand to let you sit. There are designated priority seating areas for disabled, pregnant, and elderly passengers, where passengers have to stand for these people. There is also space on buses for two wheelchairs or prams where seats can be folded up to make room.

, If you press the bell too late however, the bus may not have time to stop safely and will set you down at the next stop instead.

, If you are using a GO card, remember to touch off as you leave, or you could be charged a penalty fare. The card readers will beep and flash in the same way as when you touched on, and the screen will display how much you were charged for the trip.

Figure out how many days you are spending on the island.,
Research on the events that will be taking place around the island during your stay.,
Determine how much time to spend at one place.,
Put weather conditions into thought.","How to Plan a Cheap and Fun Time As a Tourist in Oahu, Hawaii1"," This will determine how much of the island you'll get to see or do; like Disneyland, it's nearly impossible to be on every ride and see every attraction in one day without rushing.;
, In the summer months, several yearly fairs take place, such as Bayfest Hawaii (located at the Kaneohe Marine Corps Base), the 50th State Fair (at Aloha Stadium), and the Farm Fair (also at Aloha Stadium). There is also the famous ""Triple Crown Surf"", which takes place at North Shore (same area as Turtle Bay Resort) and weekly to bi-monthly local entertainment and concerts at Ala Moana's center stage. During the fall and winter months, HIFF (Hawaii International Film Festival) and numerous parades celebrating the holiday season take place in cities throughout Oahu. The largest of these include Honolulu's ""Honolulu City Lights"" Parade. Check out the Honolulu Star-Advertiser's ""TGIF"" section for the latest activities throughout the specific week.

, This can be a very hard challenge; as most tourist attractions on Oahu can take up most of the day (or at least your energy). Places like Polynesia Cultural Center, U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, Sea Life Park, and Bishop Museum have all day tours or attractions at specific times. Like any place else, traffic is everyone's favorite enemy. Oahu is notorious for having some of the worst traffic in the nation. The top traffic spots on Oahu include Kamehameha Highway (99) in the North Shore and Pearl City areas, the H-1/H-2 freeway merge, the H-1/Moanalua Freeway/H-3 freeway merge, the Middle Street (H-1/Moanalua Freeway) merge, the H-1 freeway passing Downtown Honolulu and Waikiki, and Kalanianaole Highway from Hawaii Kai westward.

, Who wants to go to the beach when it's forecasted to rain that weekend? However, Hawaii (as a state) has it's unusual weather patterns, as it can be forecasted as ""sunny, 84 degrees, light variable winds"", but even a minute pour-down can ruin a person's day.

Figure out transportation.","How to Plan a Cheap and Fun Time As a Tourist in Oahu, Hawaii2"," Do you prefer free attractions or would you like to spend a little money here and there? Check with each official website to know of any admission prices, package deals, etc. If you are in a military family and hold a current/valid military I.D., you can receive military discounts, similar to ""Kama'aina"" (local) discounts. Haunama Bay has a small parking fee, but you can always take the city bus in & out to avoid additional drawbacks (guards will turn you away if the parking grounds are full).

, There's no reason to avoid a ""Leonard's Malasada"" stop, breakfast at Zippys, or a hot spam musubi on-the-go. Visit local fish markets to get quality sashimi (raw fish) or poke.

, If you are into those ""Visitor Pennies"", don't worry! There should be a few around the island. Waikiki, Ala Moana Shopping Center, and Ward Warehouse are the top Leeward places for a tourist shopper.

, Are you settling on car rentals or depending on city bus transportation? Just to note, speed limits are a maximum 50 mph (80 km/h) on state highways (e.g. Kamehameha Highway, Pali Highway, Kalanianaole Highway) and 60 mph (97 km/h) on freeways (H-1, H-201 (Moanalua Freeway), H-2, H-3)

,


High season is when costs are highest: January through April and October through mid-December.
Low season is when travel and lodging expenses are at their lowest: May through August.
Other times of the year are known as ""shoulder"" seasons that fall in the middle of costs and crowds for travel to Sydney.

Time your visit properly.,
Dress considerately.,
Go to the Dung Gate, close to the Temple Mount complex near the southeast corner of the Old City of Jerusalem.,
Proceed through the airport-style security checkpoint.,
Walk across the large, open plaza to approach the Wall.,
Step up to the Wall.,
Insert a handwritten note into one of the many cracks along the Wall.,
Step back toward the plaza after a reasonable amount of time to let others approach the Wall.",How to Visit the Western Wall," While the Wall itself is open 24/7, if you want to avoid large crowds, the best time to visit the Western Wall is on a weekday, either earlier in the morning or later at night, and also on days that are not major Jewish/Israeli holidays. In addition, keep in mind that the Wall will be more crowded than usual on Monday and Thursday mornings for Bar Mitzvah reading celebrations which are frequent, as well as Friday nights and Saturdays which is the Jewish Sabbath.


You will also find the Wall virtually deserted during periods of inclement weather, such as heavy rain or snow. While it may be uncomfortable being outside at these times, it can also be a blessing for the undeterred tourist as there will be few people about, and you will have greater privacy if desired.;
, While there is no official dress code, remember that you are visiting a religious site, so your clothes should be generally modest in nature at the very least. All men should wear a yarmulke (kippa) head covering at the Wall, and women should wear a headscarf if possible. These articles are typically available to borrow at the entrance for those without.

, The Dung Gate can be accessed by car, bus, or foot and is the most practical way to get to the Wall. Some other methods are as follows:


Buses #1, #3, and #38 have stops near the entrance to the Wall.
Take a taxi to the Dung Gate.
Car parking is available for an hourly rate at the Old City entrance near Jaffa Gate, then walk to the Dung Gate.

, This is simply to ensure your safety, and should only take a few minutes with your full compliance.

, This area is typically filled with tourists and worshipers alike, and is a great place to take dramatic photos looking toward the Wall.

, Here, you can say a prayer, contemplate, or simply admire the massive ancient stonework.

, This step is optional, but it is a time-honored tradition to place a note with a prayer or personal message into the Wall, and many famous people and foreign dignitaries have done this themselves.

, You can then feel free to spend time taking pictures, sitting in one of the plastic chairs to watch the crowds, etc.

"
"
Get a travel guide beforehand.This is mostly to get some ideas about what you want to see, matched up with how long you plan to stay.,
Set a good itinerary.,
Understand that Israel is very expensive.,
Understand that they are all broke.,
Come prepared for the weather.,
Remember the Sabbath (Shabat).,
Ignore your misgivings about any Israeli/Palestinian tensions.,
Understand that Israelites eat differently.,
Recognize that Israelite does not mean Jewish.,
It's cheaper in the Sinai.,
Don't miss the National trail.",How to Visit the Holy Land," Do you want to stay on the move and see everything, or concentrate your time in a couple of places, and make some new friends? You might even get invited to a Shabat dinner, if you're lucky...;
, Or, just go where the bus takes you...A decent itinerary might have you landing at Ben Gurion (where you should expect to be efficiently profiled, separated, and quizzed by smiling young Israelites), with a quick trip into the very cosmopolitan Tel Aviv (which is hardly in the holy land, by most accounts) for lunch, and then on to Jerusalem for your first couple of days; putting off a decision to head north or south until later, when you've determined whether to head into the more populous, workaday north, or the arid south through the Negev desert and the bulk of the Kibbutzim (Kibbutzes) to Eilat, the ""resort"" destination for Israelites, on the way into the Sinai (they pronounce it SINeye)...there is much to see here, in either direction; why not do both?

, You will definitely want to concentrate at least some of your time in Jerusalem; it is the city of God, and a central reason for most people's trip to the holy land.


Unless you are comfortably well off, hotels are going to take a big bite out of your budget in a hurry. Consider staying in hostels, which can still run you up to $60 a night or so, in Jerusalem, less elsewhere; they are a much better way to soak up the local color, anyway.

, This is hardly an understatement; begging is a respected profession here, but the beggars do fine, and they are not pushy.


The average starting wage in Jerusalem is about $8 an hour; A small two bedroom apartment is about $1000 a month, or more. Most people work; 6 days a week, 12 hours a day is common. They are mostly all smiling- you will see very few dejected people here.
The statement that they are ""all"" broke is possibly misleading, as this applies more to the younger set, which is typically less affluent anywhere. Even most of the younger set manages to have in home internet, possibly a car, etc.

, The north is quite a bit more temperate than the south, with four seasons. The ""high"" season in the south runs from October to March, when it is merely hot- but dry, and quite comfortable in sandals and shorts.

, Virtually the entire country shuts down from Friday at sundown to Saturday at sundown, except for the Arab businesses, and essential services. This won't seriously affect you, as the Arabs run many of the stores, but don't plan on traveling or changing hostels during Shabat. Interpret Armageddon instead.

, It is news, so you see the ""sensational"" part. They don't really hang out together, but there is much less tension than major American cities; and this is a well run country.


Dinner in east Jerusalem with Palestinians met in Old Town, Jerusalem, at the bazaar, was memorable. Unless you are of Arab descent, you probably won't go to the West Bank, or get into the Dome of the Rock; but, unless you're black, you probably wouldn't go to Watts or Compton, either, and they are both larger and more violent.
It is against the law to carry even a pen-knife in Israel.

, Pulling something out of the freezer, and putting it into the microwave, is a foreign concept here; everything you eat during your stay in the holy land was made that day; every cup of tea is made with green leaves, and every glass of juice is squeezed while you watch. And it all costs up the wazoo. Lunch will run you about $10 a day, but you will remember each meal a year after your return.


You can save considerably by grocery shopping, but this isn't always practical when traveling. Their ""grocery stores"" are little Jewish or Arab quickie-mart sized places, but there the similarity ends. Still expensive by American standards, expect a great selection of nuts (20 different kinds is common; raw or...fry-glazed?), stuff that looks like Slurpees, only real fruit, and delectable, and they most amazing flavors of fruited gelato.
The Arab stores are much more interesting, but don't bring Arab food to hang out with Jewish people; it's not like it causes a scene, but Jewish people eat kosher, so you may not be able to share- and sharing is a big part of this whole experience. Veggies, fruits, and nuts are kosher anyway, but they prepare them differently. Kosher food is great, too, but simpler.

, This distinction is hard to communicate, but it will make itself known in little ways as you relate to the people here- some of the things that you will inevitably say will be met with an uncomprehending look.


Israel is a country, while Jewish is a religion; there are also Muslims, and Christians here, all Israelites. Their government is Israelite, and they pretty much all feel about their government the same way you might feel about yours; it's their religion that plays a more central role- however, although you will certainly see Orthodox types, don't be expecting to be constantly bumping into people reading their holy book, or anything; this is a private matter to them, and there is no proselytizing here- and that means you.
It all combines very delightfully, actually, to provide a distinct sense of spirituality, and a notable lack of religiousness.

, Expect to keep paying if you head north; but for whatever reason, since Eilat, on the way down to the Sinai, is one of their nicer resort areas, at the top of the Red Sea, in the south, it's less expensive there. You'll still probably want a hostel, for the flavor if nothing else.


This is possibly because it's not exactly crowded, like Jerusalem, even on the weekends. A good guess might be that Israelites work so hard, and vacation less; and Eilat is five hours away from Tel Aviv or Jerusalem (the major tourist centers)by bus, with little in between, except Kibbutzes in the Negev desert.

If you're interested, you can walk right in, more or less, to a Kibbutz for a quick visit, but they are busy little Gardens of Eden, right there in the middle of the Negev; so if you want to stay the night, which is highly recommended, get online and set it up beforehand.

Expect communal dining and hostel-type accommodations; simple but solid, run by young Jewish interns; they pretty much grow everything- think combination plantation/farm.
The only reason you'll ever want to leave is because it's pretty warm during the day (although quite dry), even in high season, and the Red Sea is calling you- you should bring empty suitcases for shopping in the Sinai, even if you're a nomadic type; the stuff there is just too cool, and too cheap.




After the Israeli/Egypt border, headed south, you are truly in the frontier now; an hour and a half taxi ride (for like $30) will get you to Dahab, a charming little backwater right on the Red Sea; a diving and snorkeling mecca for Europeans.

Now even nomads can afford a hotel, but staying in a ""camp"" is probably still preferable, as they are cheaper, and you aren't going to be in your room, anyway.

Air conditioned rooms with mosaic floors surround charming little courtyards with lots of palms and Bedouin style open tents for evening gatherings, for about $20 a day for two, or even less. The room held $3000 worth of musical instruments and previously purchased souvenirs, and the padlock, unused, was unnecessary.




The Bedouins are easy-going, like the Egyptians, and will set you up with a driver to Mt. Sinai if you're so inclined. Little Bedouin girls (that speak whatever language you speak) sell you clever shell and wood jewelry for a dollar while you sit under a tent smoking a Sheesha by the Sea, waiting for your grilled seafood.
Average per capita income in the Sinai is high for Egypt, about $130 a month, and the living is easy. Lease a brand new, sea-front condo for about $400 a month or less, if you decide not to return. Your whole trip, from America at least, is visa-free, too!

, If you have an extra month or two, take the trail from Eilat all the way up to Dan, in the north- for free! Stop at Kibbutzes along the way for free room and board, where they will aid you in continuing your journey. A good backpack, excellent hikers (open-toed shoes, in other words), and a canteen are all you really need.


This is a very spiritual way to see the holy land; walking with mostly Jewish pilgrims, listening to their stories- simply an experience you will never forget. You have to be willing to let go to do this, and be willing to roll with things; anecdotal stories here are precious things, however, and you will be glad to have your own to tell, if you wish.

Be prepared to give up some personal space in lines at the ATM, airport, and other public venues.",How to Tour in Israel," The first thing you are likely to notice once you arrive in Israel is the noise. People are often used to shout as a manner of talking. Therefore, if you feel that somebody is yelling at you there's usually no reason to get upset - it is not intentional. On the other hand, if your impression is that the other person is upset with you, avoid a fight at all costs. Sadly, enough cases of vain violence are way too common.;
, Do not settle on a price at the beginning of the drive. Drivers might take advantage of you and demand a higher price than the norm, assuming that you have no idea of the norm anyway.

Bring your Christian Bible.,
Dress for comfort.,
Choose a comprehensive, guaranteed tour.",How to Prepare for Your Israel Christian Tour," It may seem obvious, but bringing one is absolutely critical for any Christian Israel pilgrimage. Having a Bible on the tour helps Christian travelers to embrace the significance of the gospels, from the annunciation of Christ to His crucifixion on the cross at Calvary. As tourists walk in the footsteps of Jesus, this enables them to follow along verse-by-verse to gain a renewed appreciation for His sacrifice and a deeper understanding of Israel’s culture, land and people.;
, Israel’s rough terrain, rocks and sandy hills require that travelers wear comfortable, rubber soled shoes, or better yet, sturdy sandals. Travelers should dress in plenty of layers as temperatures can fluctuate significantly in a single day. Hats, sunglasses and sunscreen are strongly recommended. Dress is casual and modest, although many Holy sites require more formal attire. For men, cardboard hats are usually provided; and you have to cover your head at these sites. Women should generally wear scarves to cover their heads and skirts that fall below the knee when visiting these Holy sites.

, Choose a guaranteed tour in order to avoid having their trips cancelled or rescheduled at the last minute because of low participation. Additionally, take the time to research a tour’s itinerary to ensure a complete Israel tour experience. A few sites that should be on your must-see list include:


Caesarea, the capital of Judea under the Romans. (Acts 9.30 Acts 10 24-48)
Tabgha, where Jesus performed the Miracle of the Bread and Fish. (Matt. 13, Mark .33-45, & John 21)
The Mount of the Beatitudes where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount. (Matt. 5, 6, 7, 8)
Ein Karem, the birthplace of John the Baptist. (Luke 1.39-80)
The Banias Spring and Waterfall, where Jesus was recognized as The Messiah by His Disciples. (Matt. 16.13 and Mark 8.27)
Nazareth and Cana of Galilee. (Luke 1.26, 4.16-29, Matthew 2.23) (John 2.1-11)
Mount Zion, where travelers can see the tomb of King David and the nearby Room of the Last Supper. (Mark 14.13, Luke 22. 10-38, Matt 26 17-29, Acts 1.13 and Acts 2 The Pentecost).

Decide when you want to go.,
Decide how long you wish to visit.,
Research and book accommodation and plane tickets.,
Determine method of transport to the park from your accommodation.,
Plan your day before you arrive.,
Pre-Purchase your tickets.,
Go beyond the normal ticket.,
Plan to go where the crowds aren’t going.,
Be prepared to eat inside Dreamworld.,
Make sure you will be wearing suitable clothing.,
See a doctor.,
Get to the park.",How to Visit Dreamworld," Going when everyone else goes, i.e during school holidays is inevitably going to mean waiting in a queue for ‘something’, be it a ride, attraction or ordering food. Alternatively going outside peak times may mean taking your children out of school. What’s the weigh up between less crowds and disruption to your children’s education?;
, Dreamworld has a number of different passes from one day to two years. There are also a number of tickets, called ‘World Passes’ that can be combined with its sister theme park next door Whitewater World. Combined, both parks cover an area of about 37 hectares and include 45 rides and attractions. If you plan to get maximum fun, you have to decide whether one day will be long enough, especially if you plan to visit both parks.

, Depending on your budget and when you want to visit will have an impact on overall cost. Visiting the park during off peak will not only save money on entry tickets but also most probably on other things such as plane fares and hotel accommodation. Remember also that it may be difficult to find suitable accommodation during certain times of the year so it may pay to book accommodation and plane fares well in advance.

, Surfside buses on the Gold Coast run a regular shuttle service between hotels and Gold Coast Theme Parks. In many instances buses can pick you up and drop you back off at your hotel. If you plan to drive your own car, read on for directions to Dreamworld.

, If possible get hold of Dreamworld’s park map or research on the internet all the different rides, shows and their times. Write down a list of what rides you want to go on and what shows you wish to see. If you’re forced to lock in a certain date, plan in case it rains. What alternatives are there on a wet day to keep it fun and enjoyable. Weather, especially during the summer peak months is very volatile and storms can sweep in at any time. Plan on bringing some wet weather clothing, sufficient for at least getting around if it looks like raining on the day. You don’t want to spend a long time pinned somewhere because you don’t have sufficient wet weather clothing to get around.

, Once you have decided on your tickets, you’ll save a lot of time queuing at the entrance gate if you pre-purchase your tickets. With pre-purchased tickets you can use the ‘express gate’ which will save you – perhaps an extremely long wait. If you want to combine your visit with Whitewater World then you should consider a ‘World Pass’ which allows to unlimited access to both parks through an interconnected gate. You can pre-purchase tickets at no extra cost online.

, If you’re really looking to get the most out of your visit, also consider purchasing an ‘early entry’ ticket. For $10 more you can enter the park one hour before the main crowd. You can purchase with Australian dollars or your credit card.


If your visit is during the peak season, consider purchasing a Q4U device. This is a virtual queuing system that reserves your spot in the line while you go off and do other more interesting things than wait in a queue. There are a limited number of Q4U’s so you must pre book one at an additional cost of $30 per family.

, Avoid the ‘follow the herd’ mentality. Many people simply follow others because they don’t have a better plan. Rather than rush from one popular ride or attraction to another, wait until mid to late afternoon when most of the crowd exits. You’d be surprised how quickly you can jump from one ride to the next with minimal waiting.

, What about food? Dreamworld does not permit visitors from bringing food into the theme park. Anything you wish to eat must be purchased within Dreamworld. If you’re on a tight budget make sure you have a big breakfast. To save time, consider eating lunch early or late to avoid the lunchtime crowds. If you plan to combine your Dreamworld visit with a visit to Whitewater World then you have the option of bringing your food and eating it in Whitewater world, which does allow food to be brought into the theme park.

, The sheer size of Dreamworld means that you will be doing a lot of walking, so comfortable footwear and clothing are important. In the probability that the weather will be fine and sunny remember to bring a hat and sunscreen lotion. If you plan to stay into the night, a coat or jacket may also be advisable.

, How’s your health? If you have a heart problem or any other health issue, you should seek your doctor’s advice as to whether you should ride the bigger and more terrifying rides.

, Dreamworld is located in Coomera just north of the Gold Coast. It is about 20 minutes drive from Surfers Paradise and forty five minutes drive from Brisbane. From the M1 Motorway take exit 54 at Coomera. Use the ‘Tower of Terror’ as your beacon. The Tower of Terror is extremely high and can be seen from miles around. Work out in advance how long it is going to take you to get from your accommodation to the theme park. If you have pre purchased an ‘early entry’ ticket you’ll need to arrive at the park at least an hour before it opens.

Be born in Israel to an Israeli parent.,
Have Israeli citizens as parents.,
Be born in Israel with no other nationality.",How to Become an Israeli Citizen1," One of the easiest ways to gain Israeli citizenship is by being born in Israel. If one or both of your parents is an Israeli citizen at the time of your birth, you are automatically granted citizenship.


You can prove that you were born in Israel by providing a legal document like a birth certificate.
Citizenship will likely be granted when you are born in this case.;
, Even if you were not born in Israel, it is possible to become an Israeli citizen by birth if one or both of your parents is also an Israeli citizen.Your parents’ Israeli nationality can have been acquired by birth, by naturalization, by residence, or by the Law of Return.
To prove that your parents were Israeli, you’ll need to go to the Israeli consulate and bring any documentation you have attesting to their Jewish heritage. This can include passports, identification cards, birth certificates (if this info is listed on the document), marriage licenses, letters from Orthodox rabbis, etc.

, If you were born in Israel and have never been granted any other official nationality, you can acquire Israeli citizenship. To do so, you must apply for it between your 18th and 25th birthdays.You must also have been a resident of Israel for at least five consecutive years at the time of your application for citizenship.
To apply, you’ll need to go to the Israeli consulate. They will be able to give you the appropriate forms. You’ll need to bring an official document (like a birth certificate) proving that you were born in Israel, along with any other identifying documents you have to explain the status of your nationality.

"
"
Understand the Law of Return.,
Rely on your Jewish heritage.,
Avoid being considered a threat to the Israeli state.",How to Become an Israeli Citizen2," The Law of Return is a rule enacted by the Israeli government in 1950 that allows all Jews, both ethnic and religious, to return to Israel as their homeland and gain citizenship.This law was created largely to create a route to safety for Jews who were misplaced by the Holocaust, and for their descendants.
A returning Jew is called an oleh (male) or olah (female).

, If you're Jewish, which is defined as being born to a mother who is Jewish or having converted to Judaism, then there is not much that you need to do. Israel will welcome you with open arms. All you have to do is go there and formally request citizenship. You can also be considered a Jew according to this law if you converted to Judaism and are not a member of another religion.
If you converted to Judaism, you’ll need a letter from an Orthodox rabbi that you can bring to the rabbinical court. This group is part of the Israeli justice system and they determine who is considered Jewish or not., The Israeli government can deny anyone citizenship under the Law of Return who they deem might be a threat to the Israeli population or who might engage in activities intended to harm Jews.This caveat is meant as a safeguard for the existing citizens of Israel and to keep people out who mean them harm.
This means that you should avoid any involvement in extremist groups, especially those who are anti-Semitic. You should also ensure that you have no criminal record and that you aren’t infected with a contagious disease.

"
"
Go to Israel.,
Prove your descent.,
Obtain an ID and citizenship.",How to Become an Israeli Citizen3," If you are the descendent of an Israeli citizen or Jew, or if you have married an Israeli citizen, you are able to apply for citizenship if you intend to settle permanently in Israel. You must settle in Israel to prove that you want citizenship for the right reasons and not just to gain an Israeli passport.
There is no time limit here on residency here. You just need to show proof that you are settling in Israel permanently. This kind of proof can include rental agreements for housing, work contracts, utility bills in your name, etc. You are not required to work during this time, but it will only help your case if you have work documents to show when you apply for citizenship.

, Visit the Israeli consulate or the Ministry of the Interior (Misrad Hapnim) with your birth certificate to prove your descent. You should also take your marriage certificate to the Ministry if your spouse is Jewish or an Israeli citizen.This is where the first stage of the application process takes place. They will give you the correct application forms to complete and tell you what other documents they may require from you.

, Once you have completed the application, you will be granted an Israeli identification card, along with citizenship documents (including a passport, though this document can take a bit longer to process).Apply for an Israeli driver’s license so that you have more documentation proving your residence status.The process for attaining an Israeli driver’s license includes getting an eye exam, visiting a physician for a health exam, scheduling a driving lesson, and taking a written examination.

"
Live in Israel for three out of five years before applying.,
Become entitled as a permanent resident.,
Renounce other nationalities.",How to Become an Israeli Citizen4," Before you are eligible to apply for naturalized Israeli citizenship, you must have established your permanent residence in Israel for at least three out of five of the years immediately preceding your application.This helps ensure that those applying for citizenship genuinely desire to be part of the Israeli community and have demonstrated it through their ability to live successfully in the country for a reasonably long period of time.

, To become a citizen of Israel, you must prove to the government that you intend to settle in Israel permanently. This means residing in Israel, locating employment in Israel, and becoming part of the community.Learning how to speak Hebrew is important at this stage as well.

, In order to become an Israeli citizen, you must renounce any other nationalities that you currently hold. This does not mean that you must give up your other citizenship, but that you will agree to adhere to the Israeli laws regarding naturalization and gaining citizenship.Alternatively, you can prove that you will no longer be a foreign national from the time of becoming a citizen. This can be proven, depending on the circumstance, through various documentation such as your birth certificate, passport, marriage license or divorce decree, etc.

Listen carefully to native speakers and their accents.,
Keep your intonation steady, quick, and soft.,
Adjust your pronunciation of ""i"" to sound more like the i in ""oil."",
Turn your hard A sound into an ""aye"" The hard A in ""way"" or ""mate"" almost sounds like an ""eye"" sound.,
Soften a soft A into an ""eh"" sound.,
Curb the T from the end of words.,
Drop the R sound from the end of words and replace it with an ""ah."",
Cut off the G from any ""-ing"" ending word.,
Raise your voice towards the ends of words.,
Adjust your ""a"" sounds to ""ah"".,
Develop a soft, playful, and twangy tone of voice.",How to Speak With an Australian Accent1," The most commonly mimicked Aussie accent is a rough, messy, casual and animated style. The accent itself requires using your tongue, cheeks and lips to almost “chew” the words as you say them. The best way to learn this is to hear it from a real Australian. As you listen, note a few things about how they speak:


What sounds are representative of the accent as a whole? What similarities do you see between words? Pay attention to vowel sounds, as these are the basis of a good accent.
Most Australians do not sound like the Crocodile Hunter. Their accents are smoother and more mellow.
Australian developed from colonists in the south of England. As such, it is closely related to the modern Cockney accent, but with a bit of twang.;
, Picture a long, constant stream of words coming out -- much like the entire sentence is one whole word. To do this, try not to move your tongue so much. One vocal coach suggests you imagine your tongue laying over an exercise ball. You don't make percussive, rhythmic sounds. Rather, the whole sentence just flows out calmly and coolly., This is one of the more important shifts you'll make. Instead of the I sound (""eye"") in ""like,"" ""might"" or ""try,"" you want something more like an ""oi"" sound, though not quite so pronounced. To make it, focus on rounding your lips as you say the I sound in ""write"" ""live"" or ""spite.""


You don't want to fully commit to the ""oi"" sound, so that you say ""wr-oite"" or ""l-oi-ke."" You just want a subtle, rising tone on your I sound. However, starting with the exaggerated ""oi"" can help you while you learn.

, It is somewhat of a compound sound, like you start with an A and then slide your voice into an I sound. While this takes some practice, you may notice that you lips move outward a bit when you get it right, flatting the O-shape your mouth makes for an A.


Way → w-aye
Date → d-aye-t.

, This part of the accent is regional, as there is no one exact Aussie accent. Simply put, it softens the a sound in words like ""hat,"" ""that,"" ""cat,"" etc. to sound more like an ""eh.""


Hat → H-eht.
That → Th-eht.
Cat → C-eht.

, Aussies replace the hard T sound with a short, almost gutteral noise instead of a full ""tuh"" sound. If you're having trouble finding it, say the words ""uh-oh."" The noise is the small, sharp stop you make between the two sounds, like you voice was just cut short. When you say the word, ""right,"" you want to sound more like ""r-eye."" Practicing ""trimming"" the T sound to perfect your accent.


You'll notice for an American T that your tongue pushes off the rough of your mouth. For the Aussie accent, try and make a similar sound without touching your tongue to the rough of your mouth.
This is called a glottal stop, and is used in several languages and accents., For example, instead of ""forever,"" you would say ""forev-ah."" Instead of ""car,"" you'd say ""cah."" This is somewhat similar to the Boston accent, however it is softer and less pronounced. Your voice drops a little bit, almost sounding like an ""uh"" at the end of the word.River → Riv-ah
Care → Kehr. Here, the R sound is subtle because the word ends in an E. Think of cutting your word off right after you start the R sound.

, Oftentimes the Australian accent cuts words short. Words ending in a G are cut off, so that ""catching” sounds like “cat-chn."" In many ways, this makes Australian similar to an informal American English, a comparison that will serve you well as you practice.


Running → Runnin'
Eating → Eatin'
Ring → Rin'

, Sometimes called the ""Australian Question Inflection,"" this little trick is common in everyday Australian speech. Simply raise your voice towards the end of a sentence, exactly like you were asking a question. Think of getting a little louder, and a little higher pitched, with the last syllable. If you're stuck, ask some questions in your normal voice, noting how you change pitch at the end, and try again., Australians have some of the most relaxed accents in the world, so instead of can't, say kah-nt, and instead of aunt, say ah-nt.

, Start by re-reading this entire article out-loud with the accent. Aussie accents have personality, so add a playful and happy tone when speaking. Many people put on a little ""twang,"" adopting some of the speech patterns of a southern accent or a cowboy, to distinguish the Aussie accent from a British one. Just like in any other country, there are multiple accents and ways of speaking, so listening to Australian speakers, shows, and songs is the best way to keep practicing.

Use Australian television, movies, and music to pick up slang quickly.,
Test out simple filler words in Australian.,
Use ""as"" at the end of sentences to provide emphasis.,
Shorten the word and add an ""-ie"" when in doubt.",How to Speak With an Australian Accent2," Slang is constantly evolving, and it is tough to find a definitive source of knowledge to determine what words are ""in"" and what are ""out."" Short of going to Australia, you best bet to pick up slang is to watch Australian media. That said, there are some words that have been around long enough, and are popular enough, that you could reasonably use them in front of an Australian and avoid weird stares.



Esky → Cooler or icebox.

Uni → University.

Arvo → Afternoon.

Thongs → Flip-flops.

Bogan → Redneck, uncultured person. Use with care-- it may be offensive.

Root → Sex. Remember this when ""rooting for the other team"" at a sporting event.Chunder → Throw up or get sick.

Stoked → Excited.

Tucker → Food., American slang is filled with simple filler words and phrase like ""gosh,"" ""guys,"" ""say what?"" etc. Australian is no different. Some things to try out include:


Ending phrases with the word ""mate."" Mate can be used anytime you would normally say ""guys,"" ""man (as in, ""come on, mate!""), or similarly simple slang terms for a person.
Using ""Reckon"" when you're thinking of something. ""I reckon that's not a bad idea, mate.""
Throwing in the phrase ""she'll be 'right,"" to ease concerns. ""I hope I didn't burn dinner... Ah, she'll be right, mate."", This is perhaps best learned through an example, such as ""This Wikihow article is great as."" Unlike in English, where you would complete the comparison (""great as good cake""), Aussies leave the rest up to imagination. You can use this with any adjective.


""That movie was sweet as, mate!"" Sweet as, in particular, is a common expression similar to a young American's ""That was totally sweet!""
""That guy is lazy as, mate."", There are a lot of Australian slang words that are simply shortened and made to rhyme with ""see."" This is where the phrase ""barbie"" (for barbeque) comes from. Some other options include:


Present → Pressie
Breakfast → Brekkie
Mosquito → Mozzie
Sunglasses → Sunnies."

,, For your own safety, stand behind the yellow line. When the train arrives and has fully stopped, open the door. Older trains have to be opened manually by hand. However, newer trains will have a button which when pushed, will open the doors automatically.

, Watch the gap. If you have a pram or a wheelchair, stand in the front of the platform, which is marked with a yellow or white triangle. When the train arrives, the driver will place a ramp for you. Write your destination on a piece of paper and the driver will assist you in getting off the train too.

, If your are on the old trains, pull the doors open when you hear the tone. If you are on a new train, push the button flashing green when you hear the tone. Watch your step as you get off the train as they may be a gap between the platform and train. If you are on a wheelchair, the driver will come out of the drivers cab and pull out the ramp to help you off the train at the station written on the note you gave earlier.

, Just hold your Myki card over the hand symbol on the green myki reader until you hear a beep. On the screen it will display the fare deducted and the closing balance and a green light. If you hear multiple beeps and see a red light, please try to touch off again. If it still doesn't work, call Myki on 13 6954 (13 Myki).

Research your trip options.,
Decide on a tour organizer.,
Apply online as soon as possible after registration opens.",How to Prepare for a Taglit Birthright Trip1," Visit the Taglit-Birthright official website to learn as much as you can about the trip, eligibility, its purpose/mission, how it works, what you will be doing, etc. Find out the date that registration opens (winter or summer, depending on the time of year) and mark your calendar or sign up for an email reminder.;
, A common misconception about Taglit-Birthright is that there is just one trip offered departing on different dates, when in fact there are over a dozen tour organizers offering various trips that cater to all kinds of interests and people. In your research, be sure to settle on a tour organizer that best matches your interests and level of Jewish observance.

, The process should not take longer than half an hour.

"
"
Obtain a passport.,
Begin looking for domestic flights if you need to fly to the departure airport.,
Pack enough clothing to last at least 10 days, but do not overpack.,
Look into renting an Israeli phone.,
Read about Israel's history.,
Learn Hebrew phrases, like ""please and thank you."",
Contact the trip organizers by e-mail.",How to Prepare for a Taglit Birthright Trip2," This should be done as soon as possible due to the lengthy processing period. It is possible to have a passport expedited, but expect an extra fee. An expedited passport takes 2-3 weeks to arrive as opposed to 4-6 weeks with routine service. In addition to the passport fee you must also pay for a passport picture, and even a tourist visa.

, Birthright no longer pays for flights within the United States, so that must be paid for on your own. Consult with friends or acquaintances about flights in order to avoid flying alone.

, The Taglit-Birthright website will suggest a certain number of each article of clothing, however you may want to bring more. Every group goes on countless hikes, so getting a little dirty is inevitable. Many people opt to change into clean clothes after such hikes.

, Phone calls between group members are free, but phone calls elsewhere cost a fortune. Place an order for one of these phones before arriving in Israel.

, The trip will be more meaningful with at least a basic knowledge of the history of Israel. Visit a local library for such reading materials.

, Hebrew is the language of Israel, but many Israelis also speak English as a second language.

, They will also undoubtedly be friendly if a participant has questions that he or she would like answered in advance.

Be prepared in general.",How to Prepare for a Trip to Israel," Israel's climate varies greatly from season to season, as well as region to region. Winters are generally cool and rainy, while summers are hot, sunny and dry. The remainder of the year is typically mild with on-and-off rainfall. You might also want to consider the best time to go politically, as while most of the time it is very safe, there are occasional periods of potentially dangerous instability and turmoil with its Middle Eastern neighbors as a result of the ongoing Israel-Palestinian conflict, so keep an eye on the news in the time leading up to your trip.;
, Obtain a passport if you don't have one already, or renew yours as soon as possible if it is due to expire within six months of the date you are scheduled to arrive in Israel. While citizens of most countries can enter Israel without a visa for up to 3 months (tourism purposes only), you should still check if there may be any visa requirements nevertheless, as Israel has some of the strictest policies in the world.


Be aware that some countries such as Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia prohibit their citizens from entering Israel, and may even consider the act of doing so to be a crime. If you are a citizen of one of these countries or any other with restrictions on visiting Israel, you may experience difficulties entering, and at the very least should have the Israeli immigration official who process you stamp a blank page in your passport that can be removed (and therefore not show evidence of having visited Israel upon return).

, With so many sights to see, it can prove to be a challenge arranging tours and transportation if you're unfamiliar with the overall lay of the land. A tour guide or tour group can help you with all of that, and there are hundreds of agencies to choose from. Most reputable agencies will provide a local guide who is fluent in Hebrew, English and possibly other languages; can drive you or your group from Point A to Point B (and back as well), and is knowledgeable in what places they are showing off to you.

, Unless you're the spontaneous type of traveler, it's a good idea to have a basic outline of where you want to go and what you want to see/do planned out. You don't necessarily have to be specific or detailed; just jot down a few of the major ""can't miss"" cities and attractions, like Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Galilee, the Negev desert, and the Dead Sea.

, Israel has an extensive array of lodging options to consider; from five-star luxury resorts to mid-range chain hotels to Bedouin-style tent camps in the Negev desert for a truly authentic experience. Don't be reluctant to haggle for a better price than the rate initially offered.

, El Al is the flagship airline of Israel, and has one of the world's safest and most sophisticated fleets with dozens of international destinations. Still, you are likely to find cheaper fares or more destinations on other airlines, or if you don't mind taking connecting flights. Be advised that almost all commercial air traffic into Israel comes in and out of Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, so you may need to drive a distance if your final destination is elsewhere in the country.

, This way, you can keep in touch with friends and family back home, and if you do your homework, you can avoid exorbitant cellular roaming fees.

, English is widely understood throughout just about all of Israel, but knowing at least some basic Hebrew words and perhaps a few rudimentary phrases will go a long way, especially when interacting with locals. Arabic and Russian are also widely understood in the country.

, You should make your first priority packing for the season of your visit, but in addition, pack plenty of modest dress too. This is because there are numerous religious sites such as synagogues, mosques, churches, temples, and shrines that warrant special dress codes to enter or even approach. As a general rule of thumb, men should wear a head covering and long pants while women should wear skirts, non open-toed shoes, and a head covering as well. If you have any questions, check with your tour guide, a local, or a religious representative that can guide you in the right direction.

, If you use common sense, pack thoughtfully, plan well in advance, and expect the unexpected, you will have a meaningful and unforgettable trip.

Wait in a calm and orderly manner.,
When you see the bus and the bus can see you, hail the bus by putting your hand out and clearly signalling the bus.,
When the bus pulls up and the doors are open, board the bus.,
If you have a ticket (Metcard or Myki), validate it by inserting it into the validator (the green machine) with the blue front side pointing towards you and the white arrow pointing downwards if it is a metcard.,
If you do not have a ticket, buy one from the driver.,
Once you have boarded the bus, sit down if there are any seats.,
To get off the bus, you must pull the cord or push the STOP button before your stop - you need to give the driver enough notice.

, If there are other passengers getting off the bus, give way to them. If you are a disabled passenger in a wheelchair, or a different passenger with ramp accessibility needs, the driver should pull the ramp out for you.

, The ticket will go into the machine and it will validate. It should return with either 1 beep for standard full fare tickets or 2 beeps for concession tickets. If you hear multiple beeps, the machine will have printed EXPIRED on your ticket, and this obviously means your ticket has expired. If you have a myki please hold the myki card on the green myki reader until you hear a beep and see a green light to touch on. If you see a red light please try to touch on again.

, Tell the driver what ticket you need and give the driver cash - the driver in most circumstances will not take large notes. Correct fare is appreciated. The driver will then key in the ticket type into the machine. The driver should give you a metcard, which is blank and you must insert this into the validator. If the driver does not issue you with a ticket, you should call Metlink on 131638.

, If you are sitting in the front seats (middle seats on some older Volvo buses) which has a sticker on the top, by law, you are required to free the seat for elderly, pregnant or disabled passengers, on request.

,, It is courteous to signal the driver in thanks or thank the driver verbally.

, If you don't you will receive an expensive 'default' fare!!!

Reserve a car rental in advance.,
Make sure you have a credit card with a high enough balance.,
Obtain an international driving permit for each driver.,
Obtain a GPS navigator with Israeli maps.,
Study the Israeli road signs in advance.,
Study the meanings of line markings on Israeli roads.,
Know the meaning of some signs in Hebrew.,
When you receive your vehicle from the rental agency, make sure you have a safety vest in the glove compartment.,
Once you are ready to hit the road from the airport, program your GPS navigator to your destination of you do not already know how to get there.,
Understand that the first road you hit will most likely be a highway that will resemble an interstate highway in the United States.,
Obey the speed limits carefully.,
Know the highways.,
Deal with traffic appropriately.",How to Drive in Israel," There are numerous car rental agencies at Ben Gurion Airport. Vehicles of all types are available from subcompact to vans. Prices are quite reasonable, and you can choose from automatic and standard transmission for around the same price. Do not pay for insurance in advance - it'll not be honored. You will be required to purchase insurance at the counter.;
, At least $2000 available balance is recommended, preferably a lot more. Most rental agencies will place a hold on your card of $1500.

, Most agencies will not ask you for one, but it is still recommended you have it.

, For any GPS navigating device, you can purchase a chip with the maps of Israel for a reasonable price.

, They are similar to European road signs and quite different from those in North America. But they are understandable to one from North America.

, They are likewise quite similar to those in Europe and quite different from those in North America. For example, in North America, a double yellow line divides the two opposing directions of traffic. In Israel (and Europe), and single white line does this.


On a rural road, this could be a dotted white line, similar those that divide lanes of a highway in the same direction. As Israel drives on the right, stay on the right of such a road except when passing where legal.

, Most signs are in three languages, but a few are in Hebrew only, particularly those pertaining to parking and safety.

, Israeli law requires this to be carried in your vehicle at all times. Rental vehicles generally contain this already, but double check in case it is overlooked., Wait until you have exited a garage before doing this, as a GPS will not pick up a signal in a garage, and if you do in a garage, it may take a while before it works again.

, It could also be a limited access highway in Europe and many other parts of the world. Even in the absence of a GPS, you can start out by following the signs to the major city where you are headed toward (e.g. Jerusalem, Tel Aviv).


Driving on one is no different than driving on one in your home country. Drivers are generally not super aggressive. There may be traffic jams at certain times, but at other times, they flow smoothly.

, Speeds are in kilometers per hour, and so will your vehicle's speedometer. In addition to officers enforcing speed, there are speed cameras in various places that issue tickets to speeders.

, Highways have exit ramps just like anywhere else in the same configurations. If your destination is reached by an exit ramp, your GPS will lead you there accordingly. There may be a traffic light, a stop sign, or a yield sign, depending on the location.


In Israel, a green light flashes several times before it turns yellow. Once a light is red, the red and yellow light come on together several seconds before it turns green. Left turns can only be made on a green or yellow arrow; there are no left turns made while yielding to opposing traffic. And right turns on red are never permitted.

, On the streets of any Israeli city are a combination of calm and aggressive drivers, just like you are probably used to where you come from. Traffic may crowd up in cities. In all, it is very manageable. Once you do a small amount of Israeli driving, you will feel very confident.

Eat and drink!,
Change your clothes and go to the synagogue.,
Seeing as it is a High Holiday, follow the same regulations as Shabbat, which means no TV, cell phone and regular phone, computer, usage of electricity, etc.,
During the actual day, you will be in the synagogue, going home for rests between the prayers.,
Once the last prayer is said and the fast is over, you are free to go home and revive yourself hoping that your year will be as sweet as honey.

",How to Celebrate Yom Kippur in Israel," The day before the fast, you should be eating and drinking a lot in order to remain focused and feel well during the fast. A few hours before the fast begins, hold a meal with your family and enjoy each other's presence as you ready for yourself for the fast.;
, One of the many Halacha (Hebrew: ""Jewish Laws"") is that you do not wear leather shoes and most people wear white, though it isn't obligatory. The first prayers start during the evening, after the fast begins. Every year, the exact time which the fast begins and ends changes, so you need to check your Hebrew Calendar.

, Sometimes, Yom Kippur falls on Shabbat.

, If you have young children, it is wise to take turns as to who stays with them at home, since their presence would distract and annoy the other people in the synagogue. If your synagogue provides children's services, have your children attend them.

Find a migration agent.,
Decide which visa you need.,
Get a sponsor.",How to Migrate to Australia1," If you wish to move to Australia, you will need to go through a long and complex visa application process. A registered migration agent can help ensure that you provide all the necessary information and documentation. He or she may even be able to smooth your way into the country by speaking with government officials.


Make sure to use a an agent that is registered with the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA).This way, he or she will be able to speak with government officials on your behalf. This can go a long way.Many migration agents live and work within Australia. However, you may also be able to find an agent who is based overseas.;
, If you decide not to use a registered migration agent, you can use the online resources provided by the Australian government to find the appropriate visa type. The DIBP's Visa Wizard can help you pick the visa that suits your situation. The online program does not include every type of visa that the country offers, but it does include the most common ones., Some migratory visas, such as a ""partner category"" visa, require you to be sponsored by a person who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident. Certain eligible New Zealand citizens may also be able to sponsor you."
"
Find an employer to sponsor you.,
Apply for a family visa.,
Consider getting a Working Holiday Visa (WHV).",How to Migrate to Australia2," If an Australian company offers you a job, you can get a work visa and eventually leverage this into permanent residency. Apply for residency once you've spent two years working for the same employer. Make sure to pay your bills, integrate into the country, and stay on the right side of the law.You may also be able to do this with the General Skilled Migration program.
This approach only works for certain approved skills. The employer must also convince the government that no Australian worker is available for the job. For highly-skilled jobs like doctors, nurses, and medical technicians, it's even possible to come straight into the country on a permanent visa.

, This subset applies if your partner, spouse, child, or parent is already a citizen or permanent resident of Australia. You may be able to secure a migration visa based on your connection to this person.Partner and Spouse Visa: You must be the spouse, fiancee, or interdependent partner of an Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident, or an eligible New Zealand citizen.Parent and Child Migration: You might be able to migrate to Australia if your child is already a citizen or permanent resident of the country. Likewise, minors can migrate to Australia as the dependent child, orphan relative, or adopted child of a citizen or permanent resident., This visa will allow you to live and work in Australia for up to 12 months, although you cannot spend more than six months working for any one employer.The WHV is not an option for permanent residency, but it can be a great way to live in Australia for a while.


You must be aged 18-30 to qualify for a WHV. You must have a valid passport with at least six months left until its expiration. You need to prove that you'll be able to financially support yourself once you arrive in Australia.You must also meet several health and character requirements. You cannot have any serious criminal convictions on the record, and you cannot have any serious (especially contagious) medical issues."

However, you will speed and smooth the process by including all of the optional documentation. Provide as much information as possible to reduce your processing time and lessen the chances that the DIBP asks you for additional information.Many migratory visas require a multi-step process.

Know that Honolulu is surrounded by tourist destinations and the quickest way of getting places is to use the H-1.,

Explore Fort Street Mall and Chinatown.,

Go for a 2 to 3 block walk from Fort Street Mall.,
Travel along Ala Moana Blvd.,

Walk along the beach.,

Use other highways to get to the Windward side.","How to Get Around Honolulu, Hawaii"," Please note that during the hours of 5 am to 8 am and then 3 pm to 6 pm are the rush hour periods of the day.

H-1 West: takes you to Aiea (Aloha Stadium, Pearl Harbor, and Central Oahu)
H-1 East: takes you towards Waikiki and Hawaii Kai (direction towards Hanauma Bay);
, Both places are next to each other and extends between the streets of Nuuanu Avenue, South Nimitz Hwy, Bishop Street, and South Beretania Street. Fort Street Mall includes a Ross Dress, Longs Drugs, and a variety of eating places along the pedestrian street. Chinatown includes a variety of Asian cultured restaurants, farmer markets, and several ""mom & pop"" shops. If you want to take city buses around Honolulu, there is a list of buses that go on North Hotel Street (center street of the area)., Between Richards Street and Punchbowl Street, there are several sights to go to: Iolani Palace, State Capitol, State Library, and King Kamehameha statue. Every Christmas at the Honolulu Hale, they put up their famous ""Mele Kalikimaka"" (Merry Christmas) building blocks and the ""Hawaiian Santa and Mrs. Santa"" with their ""shakas""., On this long road from the Fort Street Mall area to the start of Waikiki, there are Aloha Tower Marketplace, Ward Centre/Ward Warehouse, Restaurant Row and Ala Moana Shopping Center., If you cut through hotel beach accesses in Waikiki, you can actually walk from the start of Ala Moana Beach Park all the way to the edge of Waikiki Beach. It is a good sized walk, but it's well worth it. You can always take a bus in Waikiki to get back to Ala Moana Shopping Center.,

Respect Hawaiian culture.",How to Move to Hawaii," The island of Oahu is the most populated island in the Hawaiian chain. Oahu contains Honolulu and Waikiki Beach. This island offers the best chances at finding employment as well as great options for entertainment.Oahu tends to offer higher salaries than most other islands.
Honolulu is the most like other major American cities so it can be easy to adjust to culturally.
Many of the jobs on Oahu are either tourism or construction based.;
, Maui is actually slightly larger than Oahu in terms of geography, but is far less populated. Because of that, Maui is great for people who would prefer less hustle and bustle and a bit more relaxation.There are fewer jobs in Maui to choose from, due in large part to the smaller population.
Most jobs in Maui are tourism or agriculture based.
Although less hectic than Oahu, Maui still offers lots in the way of entertainment.

, The Big Island is, as the name implies, the largest of the Hawaiian Island chain. It offers a similar lifestyle to that of Maui and even Oahu in areas.Most jobs on the big island are tourism based, but there are also many agricultural jobs on the island.
The west shore, or Kona Coast, is where most entertainment and tourism is located.

, These islands are the least common places to settle for people relocating to the Hawaiian Islands. While tourism is still a common way to find employment, it is less common on these islands than the larger ones.There are also state and federal government jobs available on each of these islands.
These islands offer the most solitude, but may be difficult to afford due to limited employment options.

, Most of the housing in Hawaii is similar to what one might find in the mainland, but tends to be far more expensive by square foot. As a result, you may want to consider moving into an apartment or condo as opposed to a single family house.Single family homes are the most expensive option and tend to come primarily in three and four bedroom layouts. It would be difficult to find a one or two-bedroom single family home.
Co-Ops are apartment buildings where you do not actually purchase an apartment, but rather a share in the company that operates it. It may be difficult to get bank financing for co-ops but may be a good decision for those with enough already saved.
Condominiums are the most common choice for people relocating from the mainland and come in a wide variety of sizes and layouts. Most condos require an additional maintenance fee on top of your mortgage or rent. The average condo fee in Hawaii is $400 per month.
Rentals are available in each of these housing types, but be aware that pricing may vary depending on season and proximity to tourist attractions.

, While the housing market nationwide has reduced in costs in recent years, Honolulu is recognized as one of the few places that it is still considered a more economic decision to rent rather than to purchase a home.However, you may still consider purchasing a home elsewhere in Hawaii.


Homes are more affordable on the less populous islands, but work may be harder to find.
Leases in Hawaii can be as short as monthly, or years in length.

, In Hawaii, a large portion of the land is still owned by a few large trusts that remain from the days what Hawaii was a monarchy. As a result, you may choose to purchase a lease-hold on some land.It may be difficult to find land that is for sale if you are on a budget.
Most lease-holds last for 55 years, with payments fixed for thirty years and then adjustable based on the current market.
Financing is available for lease holds as well as purchases.

, If you have already found work, it’s important that you find a place to live near your job. Traffic can be extremely heavy on the Hawaiian Islands and commuting between islands can be difficult.Traffic can be so bad in Hawaii that many executives opt to fly to work instead of commuting by car.
Traffic is far worse in high tourism areas that also offer many jobs in the tourism industry. If you work in tourism or a related industry, you may want to live close to your place of employment.

, You may have the most success finding the right place to buy or rent by working with a realtor that specializes in the real estate market of Hawaii.

First, you need to find a good real estate agent, then begin exploring your options.

Realtors will know of properties within your price range and help you find ones in the area you’d like to live.
Purchasing a home without a realtor can be extremely difficult.

, Even if you are working with a realtor, you can still use the internet to look for places you would like to live. Most large realty websites cover the Hawaiian Islands and can provide you with many options to purchase or to rent.


Websites like Trulia.com and Zillow.com allow you to search for properties while sorting them by variables like price, number of bedrooms or size of the lot.
Websites like HawaiiRealEstate.org and HawaiiLife.com both offer similar services that specialize in the Hawaiian Islands.

, There are a few more common issues people tend to run into when moving to the Hawaiian Islands. Some of these concerns are:

It may be more difficult to locate a rental if you are moving to Hawaii with pets, particularly large dogs.
Most Hawaiian banks will put a ten-day hold on checks from the mainland, so you may want to open a local bank account and establish direct deposit for your income.
You may need to have your vehicle shipped to Hawaii, and you will be expected to get a Hawaiian driver’s license and register the vehicle at the local DMV within ten days of its arrival.

, There are many different industries in Hawaii that one can find gainful employment in, but you need to have an understanding of what type of work you’re willing to do and any legal restrictions you may encounter.Medical, legal and government positions are among the highest paying jobs in Hawaii.
Food service and transportation are among the lowest paying positions.
If you are moving to Hawaii from another country, you will need to obtain a work Visa.

, If you already have an established career, it makes sense to pursue working within the same field once you reach the Hawaiian Islands. However, if your current career field isn’t an option, you may need to choose a different line of work.


Tourism is the largest industry in Hawaii and offers many great opportunities for people relocating to the islands.
Agriculture also offers many opportunities for employment on most islands.
Other career fields common in Hawaii are nursing, education and hospitality.

, Before you make the move to warmer climates, you should begin your job search by reaching out to any contacts you may have in Hawaii. If you don’t have any, use professional social media platforms to establish some.Let friends or old coworkers in Hawaii know that you are looking to relocate and would like to know about any job openings they may be aware of.
Use LinkedIn to find employees of companies you’d like to work for in Hawaii and reach out to them. They may be willing to help.
Use LinkedIn and other social media platforms to identify companies that you may be interested in pursuing employment with.

, Staffing firms and recruiting agencies connect candidates to jobs for a living and can be a great asset for anyone seeking employment. There are some agencies that even specialize in finding work for people in Hawaii.Some companies, like Altres.com, offer only positions available in Hawaii and even list some jobs not available in other job boards.
Recruiters will look for jobs that match your existing skill sets and abilities.
Taking a contract or temporary position through a staffing firm is a great way to network as well as finding employment for a fixed period of time.

, There are many websites designed to help job seekers find open positions around the world, and Hawaii is no exception. You can use websites to peruse job listings and apply for jobs you may be qualified for.Monster.com and Indeed.com both have postings listed in Hawaii, as well as many other job posting aggregator websites.
Be wary of postings on websites like Craigslist that ask for personal information to be provided over the internet.
Government job listings in Hawaii can be accessed via USAJobs.gov

, If you have a specific career field in mind, or you’ve found a company that you would really like to work for, try contacting them and asking about any openings they may have.Some companies may have positions open that have not yet been listed on job board sites.
You may reach someone that can help you land the position you’re looking for.
Inquire about scheduling an “informative interview” wherein you can meet to discuss the company without any particular job opening that you are pursuing. It’s a great opportunity to network.

, Most products in Hawaii cost more than you may be accustomed to coming from the mainland United States. All products must be shipped to Hawaii, dramatically increasing their costs and utilities are also more expensive.Things like electricity can cost two to three times the average price of the same usage on the mainland.
Dietary staples like milk and other common groceries are also significantly more expensive.
Property values are extremely high, so housing is more expensive than most places in the mainland United States per square foot.

, Living on an island brings about risks that you may not be accustomed to now, but will need to adjust to after moving to Hawaii. While it is a safe place to live overall, you’re at a higher risk of experiencing some emergency situations than you would be elsewhere in the United States.Hurricanes and tsunamis are a dangerous reality for those living in Hawaii and other island nations.
There are dangerous forms of sea life that thrive in the coasts of Hawaii. While shark attacks are uncommon, they are not unheard of.

, Hawaii is a rabies free state, which means they take the risks brought about by imported pets extremely seriously. You will have to be prepared to leave your pets in quarantine for a period of time upon your arrival to the island.Depending the on the age, breed and species of your pet, it will be quarantined for anywhere from five to one hundred and twenty days to ensure it does not carry the rabies or other communicable viruses.
Your pet should have all necessary vaccinations before arriving on the island.

, Hawaii is a very welcoming place with countless reasons to live there, but it is not without issues. Because of the colonial history of Hawaii, native Hawaiians suffered a great deal at the hands of others through economic, political and even violent oppression. Remnants of the tension between native Hawaiians and people relocating to the island remain to this day.“Haole” is a term for “mainlander” and is often used to describe those who relocate or visit the island from elsewhere in the world. It is not always used in a derogatory way, but it can be. You should become familiar with the term and what it represents.
Be respectful of Hawaiian culture and keep in mind that you are relocating to a place with a rich cultural history.
Lean the areas that are unsafe to travel in alone or at night. Like most places throughout the world, there are some areas that are more dangerous than others.
Participate in community events and make friends with the people you live near in order to establish yourself as a respectful haole.

, There are no shady spots on the hike (excluding being inside of the pillbox) and it will be hot on a sunny day.

, Have sturdy, hiking shoes, as you will be ascending rocks along the way.

, It is recommended to stay hydrated while hiking; a water camelbak type device is highly suggested, as the water stays in a bag that you wear like a backpack with a thin hose you can drink from.

, Lanikai is situated in the south-east corner of Kailua's shore, hidden behind Kailua town.

, The only city bus route that enters Lanikai is the 70. If you're coming from Honolulu, you can take Route 56 or 57 and transfer to the 70 at the Kailua Road/Hamakua Drive intersection in Kailua.

, There is only one public road that connects Kailua to Lanikai. It's important to know that you must park on the side of the street, as there is no public parking lot.


To get to Lanikai from Honolulu: Take the Pali Highway to Kailua Road. At the Kailua Road/Oneawa intersection, keep going straight to go on Kuulei Road. Turn right onto South Kalaheo Avenue and keep going straight. Turn left onto Alala Road. Go around the curve on Mokulua Drive. Lanikai's main road is one way, so you'll be merging on the right. Take the second right onto Kaelepulu Drive. Drive up the hill and near the top (on the left), you will see a ""Private Driveway"" sign.

, Know that there are no handrails and that you are hiking up a mountain ridge.

, At times, rocks can be large to get up to the next ""height"". Using sturdy and thick branches will be a huge advantage.

, These pillboxes were once used as shelter bunkers during World War II by soldiers to keeping guard on the coast. The bunkers might stand above five feet, but if you can safely get up on top, the view is magnificent, even from a comfy seated position.

, While the Pacific Ocean and Mokulua Islands may be the special ""highlight"", turn around to see a great view of Kailua and Enchanted Lakes.

, There are three pillboxes in total, one leading to another section of the mountain ridge and ascending higher. Most people tend to climb to the first one, then descend back down.

Add your toiletries at the last minute.","How to Pack for Two Weeks in Oahu, Hawaii"," Before you begin packing, think about what you plan on doing during your stay in Oahu, Hawaii, and plan accordingly. One of the most tourist-bound locations in Oahu is Waikiki Beach. If you plan on staying on, or visiting, Waikiki Beach, plan accordingly to visit a beach. Other popular Oahu attractions include hiking the Diamond Head Crater, a Natural Historical Landmark. Before you even begin packing, make a list of your itinerary, and pack your bags based on that.;
, Oahu is a tropical climate, and the weather usually averages between 70°F (21°C) to 85°F (29°C). Because of the steady warm weather, Oahu is not the destination to bring winter attire to. When choosing clothes to pack for Hawaii, think light.



Do not jam pack your suitcase with fuzzy sweaters and blue jeans. Not only will these things take up more space in a suitcase, they will make for a sweaty and uncomfortable vacation. Pack your summer attire when thinking about clothing for your vacation in tropical paradise.

, Do not hesitate to be picky when choosing a suitcase to take along with you on this trip. If you have to question whether the old suitcase in the back of your closet will endure your travel, do not bring it. Your suitcase should have plenty of space, and an abundance of storage pouches.


It's also a good idea to pick a suitcase with a completely funky, unique pattern. This will make it easier to spot your suitcase in baggage claim, and avoid any confusion with others.
Use a suitcase that is slightly larger than necessary to accommodate souvenir space. If you don't want to hassle with additional baggage fees, it's recommended shipping a flat rate box to yourself.

, When choosing what you will be packing in your suitcase, think in the mindset of packing light. Chances are, during your stay in Hawaii, you will have access to laundry facilities at little to no cost at all.

, Below, is a clothing list. It is biased to women; however, it can be adapted to men, as well. You can change this list to adapt to your needs, as they are. By no means at all is this list an end-all-be-all of things you have to take with you, of a restricted quantity.


5-6 casual t-shirts and tank tops. You don't have to wear a new shirt everyday you're on your trip. By packing a limited amount, you are being space-efficient to your suitcase and saving yourself some laundry work. Same goes for all other article of clothes.
3-4 pairs of comfortable shorts. Pack a variety of shorts, but they should be comfortable. Be aware, when you are packing your clothes, that this list is meant to be mixed and matched. Steer away from bold color patterns. Stick with simple blue denim, white, and black shorts, and be wary of patterns.
1 pair of jeans. Only one pair of jeans is really necessary. These are for dinners and outdoor activities like horseback riding. You will not need more than one pair on the duration of your trip.
2 casual blouses. This one was obviously geared towards the ladies. If you're a man, opt instead for polo shirts, or button-ups. Steer away from suits and ties. A very slim amount of dining facilities in Hawaii require a strictly formal dress code.
2-3 bathing suits. This one is important, especially if you plan on spending time near the water. Three bathing suits is ideal, but a minimum of two is perfectly okay. This way, you can alternate drying them. Make sure you place one suit in your carry-on bag, just in case you have some slight luggage complication. Even if you are a guy, do not skip out on this suggestion. Putting on a cold, damp swimsuit is never fun.
2 suit cover-ups. This one is especially a must if you plan on shopping shortly after spending a day at the beach. Make one of the cover ups a full coverage (sheer is fine) cover up. Online, you can find plenty of cute crochet cover ups that are elegant while still being casual at the same time. For ladies, a sarong is great. These can tie around the waist and serve as a cute, bohemian cover up, and serve multiple functions. Whatever you choose, keep it beach-casual and think efficiently.
2-3 sundresses/skirts. Ladies, these are very cute when done right. Maxi dresses and maxi skirts are wonderful tropical destination attires. Be wary when selecting these dresses and skirts. Sea breezes can be quite strong along the coast, and short dresses/skirts when not tight/form fitting, are quite likely to blow up and over, which may cause for an embarrassing situation. Sundresses can also double as swimsuit cover ups.
1 nice outfit for semi-formal outings. It's perfectly fine to have one well put together dressy outfit for nights out. Girls, think casual dresses and wedges/flats/dress sandals. Guys, think button up with khakis and a pair of flip flops.
3 pajama combinations. Opt for leggings/sweatpants with normal T-shirts. These can double as comfortable and casual outfits for the airport.
6 pairs of socks. Self-explanatory. You may want to add a few to this number and always keep an extra pair or two in your day bag- Socks are easily soiled, and damp/wet socks are annoying, and are very likely to irk you if you are required to walk around in them.
6 pairs of underwear. Alternate the styles to fit your outfits. For example, T-backs and seamless styles are far more suitable for spandex like clothing.
4 bras. Neutral colors and versatile styles are best. Nude, black, white. Racerback, sports bra, strapless, etc.
2-3 active outfits if you plan on rigorous outdoor activity. Opt for breathable, fast drying materials. If you plan on working out, pack yourself some spandex shorts, yoga pants, etc; Don't forget compression shorts and other necessities.

, Once you have chosen what clothes you are packing, organize them by category, fold them as tightly and space-efficiently as you can. Place these aside for now.

, Get them out and lay them aside for now (you'll pack them in the next section). You should also plan to be efficient with the shoes you pack. No matter how tempting it may be to pack those dazzling pumps your hubby bought you as a gift, they will not be necessary on the islands. Stick to a bare minimum here, but do not cheat on comfort, or style. Many comfortable shoes are also stylish, so here are some good options to include:


One pair of training shoes. Nike Frees are great choices. these will make wonderful shoes for sightseeing, hiking, and other rigorous outdoor activities. These will most likely be your most space consuming shoes, therefore it's a good idea to wear them to the airport to save space in your suitcase. Picking a shoe with comfortable padding, arches, and size will serve you well on your sightseeing- and trek through the airport.
1 pair of flip-flops. These are perfect for a two week outing to Oahu, Hawaii. They don't take up lots of space in a suitcase, and you can never go wrong with flip-flops on a tropical vacation.
1 pair of dress sandals or flats. Perfect to pair with your dinner outfits, and you only need one. Don't try to pack three of these as your 'flip flops'. Flip flops are much less likely to cause blisters. Save these for nights out on the town and dinner reservations.

, Get small bags to store your different toiletries in based on the categories they fall under. One caboodle (They sell these at Target) can fit all of your travel sized bath supplies and makeup. This can fit snugly amongst your clothes in your suitcase. Also consider a bag for hair items, and another for feminine products, regardless of if you plan to be on your cycle or not during your trip to Oahu. Better safe than sorry. Suggested Toiletries:


Toothbrush
Toothpaste
Mouthwash & Floss
Teeth whitening strips
Face wash & Acne wash
Cotton swabs
Facial moisturizer
Body wash
Deodorant
Body mist
Shampoo
Conditioner
Leg razors, bikini trimmers, + Shaving cream

Heat Protectant
Heat tools for hair

, As you pack, prepare a piece of paper you will use to make inventory of the items you pack. This will be useful when you are packing to come home. This way, you will not miss anything.

, Make sure easily wrinkled items are rolled. Fold everything in a compact matter and condense everything. If you are positive your suitcase is not large enough to accommodate everything you are packing, invest in space saving bags that will remove the air from packages and allow you to store them flatly.

, If you have a net pouch/pocket on the top section of your luggage, this is a good place to store your intimate wear and bathing suits. They will be easily accessed here. Also place your socks here.

, Use your space wisely, and reassure you folded everything efficiently.

, Add your active-wear.

, This is especially important for sheer blouses and silk, which may wrinkle easily.

, Other items, like maxi dresses and skirts, can be rolled and placed in gaps between clothing.

, Just be sure to place them so that the potentially dirty soles of the shoe are not against any clean clothing.

, Chances are that you need your toiletries until shortly before you leave, unless you have extras. Pack them in a water-resistant toiletry back that will keep in any spills, should they occur on the plane or in transit. If desired, you can wrap the whole toiletry kit in a plastic grocery bag to be safe, and then put it in your suitcase.

Macy's and Sears are on the opposite sides of the mall from each other, with Starbucks nearby each of them., Performances usually happen around the lunch hours or between 6 and 8 pm. Ala Moana is also known for 4th of July and New Years fireworks, singing talent competitions, and the annual Christmas events., Everything from pizza, Chinese noodles, sandwiches, Hawaiian plates, tacos, and Korean dishes. Some of the food court vendors are open before the actual mall is, but it becomes crowded throughout the day., Known for their nightly entertainment, pupus (appetizers), and drinks, it gets crowded on the weekends. The music can be heard on mall & 3rd floor on the same wing, so have fun while shopping at night.,"

, In the back of the gaming area, you'll find vendors that carry pizza, cotton candy, soda, French fries, plate lunches, and hotdogs. Just be aware that the food vendors will only take Bayfest script, not money, so you'll need to buy script ahead of time.

, It's not a carnival without the rides! E.K Fernandez hosts the Bayfest and the 50th State Fair carnival rides: from child rides in the front's left hand corner, to the Zipper, swings, Pirate Ship, and the famous Ferris Wheel. Ride admission is typically anywhere from 2 to 6 scripts, though booths are found throughout the lot.

, Bayfest has fireworks every night which are visible clearly around the entire Kaneohe Bay view and Aikahi side. Fireworks usually start between 9:00 pm and 9:15 pm, and last for 10 to 15 minutes.

, Each night ends with a spectacular concert. In the past years, Bayfest goers have seen Alan Jackson, America, Go Jimmy Go, Papa Roach, Collective Soul, Liz Phair, Lynyrd Skynard, Brad Paisley, and a whole lot more. Usually a local band will be the opener or the finalist of ""Battle of the Bands"".


Band lineups will be announced to the public between May and June.

Learn how to play.",How to Enjoy the Hawaiian Ukulele," The term ""ukulele"" defines as ""jumping flea"". It was brought to Hawaii by the Portuguese and because of how the strings were played, it was thought that the fret board was covered with fleas.
, Almost every Hawaiian singer, whether they are traditional or modern, uses the ukulele - from the fast paced Jake Shimabukuro to the slow Keali'i Reichel. One of the legendary Hawaiian musicians, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole, can be heard practically everywhere. Such as commercials, films, and when you're put on hold while you call on some business lines., This also isn't hard to find while you're taking a trip in the Hawaiian islands.

Plan to attend onsite interviews.",How to Get a Job in Australia," There are numerous subcategories of skilled work visas offered by the Australian government, but only two main categories. One is the employer-sponsored work visa, which involves Australian employers supporting visa applications due to the applicants’ relevant skills.In this instance, you will be lining up a potential job before completing your visa application process.;
, This is the other of the two main categories of of Australian skilled work visas. As the name indicates, it involves testing to determine your skills and thus suitability for a work visa.This, and every work visa category and subcategory, has some unique requirements. That said, all skilled work visas require, among other things, that you be under age fifty and possess “competent English” language skills.

, An EOI is not a visa application in itself, but rather a way to bring yourself to the attention to Australian employers and government entities, who may in turn choose to support your subsequent visa application. If you have the right mix of attractive skills and qualities, an employer or government agency may nominate you for an appropriate work visa.A completed EOI is required in order to apply for a points-tested visa.
A completed EOI is not required of, but is available to, applicants for an employer-sponsored visa.
Visit SkillSelect at http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Work/Skil#.

, Before you can complete a work visa application, you must provide documentation of a completed health examination. You must also demonstrate proficiency in the English language by scoring adequately on one of several recognized exams.


For more on health exam requirements, visit http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa/Heal/meeting-the-health-requirement.
For more on acceptable language tests and scores, see http://www.border.gov.au/Lega/Lega/Form/Immi-FAQs/aelt.

, Consult the Australian Skills Recognition Information website to find out if your qualifications will need to be confirmed by a relevant professional organization. Depending on your profession and place of study, it may be necessary to complete a bridging course or additional study.


When you apply for jobs, it will be important that you can state your qualifications in terms of their Australian equivalents.

, If you do not qualify as a skilled migrant, you may encounter some difficulty obtaining a visa. If this is the case, consider undertaking a professional qualification or gaining some work experience before applying. If your English is not fluent, you may consider taking a language course with a recognized provider.


Some work visa subcategories are regionally-focused, so it may help to apply for a visa in a region where there is less job competition and/or more demand for certain job categories.
Take the time to make sure you understand the intricacies of the visa process; a wealth of information is available on the government website., If you require a visa to work in Australia, submitting an application to the relevant government authority is your first priority. Prospective employers will ask about your immigration status, and having your visa (or at least having started the application process) is a prerequisite for most job vacancies.


You can apply online at http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa/Appl.
Remember, visa priority is given to people who have skills, qualifications and experience in shortage occupations.

, If you are a foreigner who has just graduated from an Australian higher education institution, you may be eligible to for a special visa that will enable you to stay and work in the country. Among other qualifications for the Temporary Graduate Visa, you must be under age fifty, have an existing valid visa (e.g. a student visa), meet language and education requirements, and have eligible and relevant skills.


There are two “streams” of this visa available to graduating students, based on factors like your skills and the nature of your educational experience in Australia.
For more information on and application materials for the Temporary Graduate Visa, see http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/485-.

, Say, for instance, you are under age thirty and would like to travel across Australia and make a bit of money to cover your expenses. In this case, you may be eligible for either a Work and Holiday Visa (subclass 462) or a Working Holiday Visa (subclass 417). These visas may permit you to stay and work in the country for up to a year.


Requirements include (but are not limited to) travelling without dependent children and having enough money (roughly $5000 Australian) to cover expenses and a plane ticket home.
See http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visi/Visi-1 for more application details.

, Be wary of offers for help getting an Australian work visa, because there are unfortunately many visa scam artists out there. The Australian government keeps a list of common and current scams at http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa/migration-fraud-and-scams. For instance, don’t fall for scam phone calls demanding immediate payment for a visa renewal, and be very cautious regarding promises of an Australian visa and job (with an initial payment) on job websites.


It is illegal for third parties (employers, etc.) to financially gain from nominating or sponsoring someone for a visa. In other words, a potential Australian employer cannot ask you to pay a fee ahead of time for sponsorship, or deduct from your paycheck after the fact. Legitimate professional service fees can be charged, however., If you haven’t decided on the industry you’d like to work in, choose wisely. The major industries in Australia are agriculture, mining, tourism and manufacturing. The industries of highest recent growth are mining, financial services, tourism and telecommunications.


Keep an eye out for “Skills Australia Needs” events or information booths at skilled migration conferences worldwide., Millions of vacancies are posted online. You can use common online job sites, or government-supported sites.Some advertisements are not published online, so also check newspaper listings. Consult the job supplements in major papers like The Age (Melbourne), Sydney Morning Herald (Sydney), The Courier-Mail (Brisbane) and The West Australian (Perth).
To learn about vacancies in a particular organization of interest, consult the recruitment section of its homepage.

, It is important that your CV (also called a résumé in Australia) is in the Australian style. While it won’t look completely different from a CV elsewhere, Australian CVs tend to be longer than, for instance, American versions.Despite often being longer, however, Australian CVs highlight essential information on the first page in categories like ""Career Summary"" (a brief statement), ""Key Skills,"" ""Key Qualifications,"" and sometimes ""Key Training"" and/or ""Key Affiliations.""
Look online for samples or templates of Aussie-style CVs and cover letters., Generic, one-size-fits-all cover letters work as poorly in Australia as they do everywhere else. In addition to tailoring each letter, make sure to state that you have been granted permission to work in Australia (or are in the process of applying). Provide an Australian postal address and telephone number in your CV if possible., Even today, many jobs aren’t advertised through the media, so personal contacts are key. Take advantage of networking opportunities and expand your networks through joining professional associations. If you establish a contact within a company, inform the contact when you make an application – it may get your CV to the top of the pile.Whether it’s someone you worked with during a college internship or someone you met surfing, networking contacts can pay big dividends in finding a job.

, Target every potential employer and recruitment agency in the region in which you plan to settle. Speculative (""cold"") applications are common in Australia, so apply even if there’s no advertised vacancy, especially if you have made contact with someone within your network.


When in doubt, send in an application. Remember, your goal at this point is to secure interviews., If you do not receive a confirmation of your submission, contact the human resources department. Likewise, don’t hesitate to contact the company if you have not received a response within a couple of weeks.This is common practice in Australia, and is not considered inappropriate; on the contrary, it demonstrates your enthusiasm.

, If you are called for interview, try to be in Australia to attend in person. Very few employers will engage candidates on an unseen basis, although you might suggest a videoconference (e.g. Skype) interview if you can’t be physically present. Remember to bring (or send along) copies of your work visa and references for employers to examine.


When it comes to interviews, Australian employers value punctuality, optimism, and the ability to provide concrete examples to illustrate a point. So be on time, upbeat and ready with examples!
They also like to gauge your personality by asking about your hobbies, strengths and weaknesses, and so on."

Find out what sort of accounts the toll road you intend to travel most on offers.,
Grab your tag/pass, and (if applicable) install it onto your windscreen.",How to Drive on a Tolled Road in Australia1," All toll roads in Australia collect tolls electronically. There are no longer any cash booths on any Australian toll road, meaning you usually need to make payment arrangements prior to travelling on a toll road.

, Most toll operators provide two account types, electronic tag/pass/eTag, and video tolling/number plate recognition. You can also purchase a pass. Getting an account is usually more economic if you intend to use toll roads more than 12 times a year.

, Fund the account (usually with a credit card or BPAY).

Driving on the LHS means that your steering wheel will be on the right of the car with the gears to your left.,
Understand the speed limits in Australia.,
Be aware that red means red on traffic signals.,
Australia has many 'roundabouts' - known as 'traffic circles' in some other nations.,
As for turning right, you must give way to all oncoming traffic at all times.",How to Drive in Australia,"


The basic challenge for an unfamiliar driver will be that it is not left-hand turns which are problematic. Simply be in the left-hand lane, obey any traffic signals and a left-turn is easy.;
, Speed limits vary between different types of roads and the areas that you are in.

, You can never turn left on a red.

, The rule here is simple. Approach, slow down, and look to your right. If you see a car, stop before entering the roundabout - that car is more than likely going to pass you (it's 2 of the 3 options). As you become more accustomed to LHS driving, you'll learn to look for the other car's indicator. If it's flashing a right hand turn, it won't be in your path and you are good to go on. But always slow down and remember that even the locals get very conservative on multiple lane roundabouts.

, At large intersections, a 'right turn arrow' may appear giving you right of way. At intersections without an arrow, it is permissible to creep into the middle (so long as you don't obstruct anyone ... just slowly move into a 'ready to turn' position). It's not uncommon to just 'sit' for up to a minute in this spot. A break in traffic will come, but you are also allowed to 'turn on the red' if you are already in the intersection. That is, as oncoming traffic (and the flow-through behind you) stops to observe the new red light, you can hurry on through with your right turn before the intersecting traffic begins to move.

If using a tag, make sure your tag is correctly mounted on the windscreen.,
Drive through under the toll gantry (all lanes).,
Listen for a beep (if using a tag).",How to Drive on a Tolled Road in Australia2," Most tags for passenger cars mount on the top of the windscreen horizontally. Tags on trucks or buses should usually be mounted at the bottom of the windscreen, sometimes vertically. Use the holder provided to hold the tag. Extra holders are generally provided for free so you can use the tag in any other cars you may own.;
, Avoid lane changes. You do not need to slow down., One beep normally means all is well. Check your manual for other beep sounds.

Purchase the correct pass.,
Drive through under the toll gantry (all lanes).,
You do not need to do anything more.",How to Drive on a Tolled Road in Australia3," Passes can be purchased online, or usually at service stations.

, The video camera will take a photo of your number plate as you drive past, and match it with a database of vehicles assigned to passes.

, You will not receive an invoice, or any confirmation letter.

"
"
If you drove through an electronic lane, and you didn't have a tag, a video tolling account or a pass, relax.

,
Call the toll operator.,
Purchase a pass.,
Pay the invoice.",How to Drive on a Tolled Road in Australia4,", Most toll roads have the toll road operator's phone number on the side of the road. It is imperative you ring them within 48 hours to avoid a fine notice.

, Some toll roads will allow you to purchase a pass up to 48 to 72 hours after travelling. Purchasing a pass will ensure you do not receive a fine.

, If you do not purchase a pass or arrange payment with the toll road operator, you will receive an invoice in the mail, which will be the amount of the toll, and a processing fee. If you do not pay this initial invoice, the matter is usually referred to the police / relevant state authority, where costs will escalate and criminal charges may be pursued."

Consider the popular locations for Australian property.,
Cover the legal issues.,

Be aware of the standard of health and education in Australia.,
Consider the transport options.",How to Buy Property in Australia," Forget the American dream – the majority of Brits fantasising of foreign shores today cite Australia as their number one destination. A new life down under appeals to many, young and old, as the lure of better weather, affordable housing and plenty of business opportunities seems to get British pulses racing. Despite being on the opposite side of the world, Australia promises an easy move due very few cultural differences. Add a good quality of life and a lower cost of living into the mix and you have a very enticing destination indeed. In fact, it is this quality of life that is the main attraction of Australia, with year-round outdoor living easily achieved, and a good range of facilities and amenities in which to enjoy the sunshine.


Do bear in mind the weather factor when choosing a location though, as some areas are stiflingly hot during the summer months and some places rain more than you’d expect!
Australia suffered from a slight ‘correction’ around four years ago, but recovered to post annual house price rises at a modest rate for the past three years. The global economic recession is now beginning to bite, property price rises are cooling, and there is less buyer interest in the market, so for those looking to emigrate there could be some great bargains to be had. Figures suggest that the rate of economic contraction in Australia is less than in many other developed countries, so the recession may be less severe there than in other places.;
, The major cities such as Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Melbourne are seeing the biggest rises in property prices – and indeed in British expats. Since the majority of British buyers tend only to purchase as a result of a permanent move, these cosmopolitan centres provide the best potential for work – especially for those on a ‘Skilled Migrant’ visa. Having said that, the booming tourist industry provides a great way to earn an income in a coastal area, with many Brits opting to set up their own business in popular destinations such as the Gold Coast and Cairns in Queensland. If you are looking to make your pound stretch further, then you could look in a more rural area – just remember that rural in Australia could literally mean remote, so do your research thoroughly first.

, If you aren’t an Australian citizen, or permanent resident, it is highly likely that you will need to gain permission from the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) before you can purchase a property. Once you have applied, the FIRB will give you an answer within 40 days, however they do reserve the right to extend this to 130 in unusual circumstances. You are able to exchange contracts before you have received approval – however it is important to ensure that the contract is conditional on receipt of approval, otherwise you will be in breach of contract and liable for financial penalties. This removes you from the possibility of buying at auction (a common practice in Australia), as auction bids are made without conditional clauses. If you buy a new-build property, or even a rural home, then you are less likely to have to seek permission from the FIRB – your solicitor will be able to advise you on whether the property that you are interested in is exempt or not.

, Once you have had an offer on an Australian property accepted, you will exchange contracts pretty much straight away. You are entitled to a cooling off period (usually five to ten days), and the contract will be conditional on certain clauses (such as a survey and mortgage approval), but basically you are now tied into the purchase and will be required to pay a ten per cent holding deposit. Please note that the cooling off period does not apply if you purchase at an auction. Your solicitor will run local searches, similar to those in the UK, and will check the title dead before you are able to complete. Completion occurs six weeks after the day of exchange.

,, If you are planning on emigrating to Australia, and sorting out a mortgage when you are there, it is a good idea to take a copy of your credit history, and even a letter from your bank manager, with you. This should make the application process easier, since you are effectively starting again and cannot rely on a good credit history to help gain finance. The majority of Australian mortgages are repayment, and there is not such thing as a self-certification loan – meaning that all mortgage applications must be supported by proof of income. Generally mortgages are available on an 80 per cent loan-to-value basis, but there are plenty of different types to choose from if you which to offset you repayments against your savings or current bank accounts. Currently, no UK banks will lend on an Australian property, so if you do wish to raise the finance at home you will have to find other means, such as releasing equity from your UK property.

, As in any country, buying a property in Australia is an expensive business – on average you should budget around five per cent of the purchase price to cover the red tape. This is broken down into a Land Transfer Registration fee, which varies from state to state; legal fees, which generally range between AUD$500 and $1,200 (£250 and £600); mortgage application; local tax, which again varies from state to state; survey, which will cost in the region of $500 (£250) and buildings insurance.


Some states will also demand that you have a termite and pest inspection, and if you are buying an apartment it is advisable to commission a strata inspection which determines whether the building as a whole has had any structural problems – or been subject to any administration concerns. Australian taxes also vary depending on which state you live in. However, if you spend more than six months in a year in Australia, you automatically become liable for income tax. Capital gains tax is payable on any property apart from your principle residence, but the amount you pay varies depending on your personal circumstances.

, It is important to know that Australia House in London no longer helps potential immigrants obtain visas, however, there is still a wide range to choose from. You will find the whole application process easier if you employ the services of a professional immigration consultant.


No matter what your reason for visiting Australia, you will need a visa to enter the country – the type will depend on your intentions while there. Visas are broken down into four main categories: residence, temporary residence, migration and visitor. An Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) visa allows you to stay in Australia for up to three months, although in certain circumstances this can be extended to 12, and is the most common visa for British travellers.
Temporary Residents tend to be made up of skilled migrants who are entitled to live in Australia for four years, usually after receiving sponsorship. Alternatively, the Investor Retirement Visa allows people over the age of 55 to stay for up to four years by investing over $500,000 (£250,388) into their chosen state.

, The biggest advantage that new-build property offers is that you are less likely to need government permission to purchase it (see legal issues), however you will need to get in quick. Developers tend to gain FIRB approval in advance, so that they are able to sell a maximum of 50 per cent of the scheme to foreigners, which makes purpose-built developments exceedingly popular.


There is a far greater choice of resale homes, but the obvious disadvantage is the red tape. Once you have successfully navigated this however, you will be in a much better position to add value to your home, as new-builds always command a developer’s premium. Resales also tend to have better positions – an important fact as many properties Down Under have views to die for. It is possible to buy a plot of land in order to build your own home, however you will once again be subject to certain restrictions – the biggest one of which is that you must begin building within 12 months of purchase. This can be a tricky thing to commit to, due to gaining planning permission, commissioning architects and finding a good builder.

, If you are considering buying in a city, then investment potential in Australia is very good. Sydney saw a whopping 50 per cent price increase in 2000 thanks to the Olympic Games, while the total growth on the east coast between 1997 and 2003 hit an impressive 112 per cent. Naturally things have calmed down since then, with Brisbane and Melbourne reporting increases of just three per cent last year – and Sydney dropping eight per cent since 2003. This shouldn’t put investors off however, as such huge growth simply cannot be sustained. On the west coast Perth is still achieving 15 per cent capital growth per annum.


If you are planning on renting your property out, then again city centres are a good bet – but so are the tourist destinations. If you buy on a development that offers a rental programme, expect to earn between three and six per cent a year.

, Australia’s national health service is called Medicare, and is available to British citizens travelling in the country due to the current Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA) with the UK. Permanent residents are also covered, but if you have entered Australia under another visa programme your eligibility may be waived. Retirees are a prime example of those that aren’t eligible, so if you are moving to Australia on an Investor Retirement Visa you will need to budget for comprehensive health insurance via an Australian firm.


The education system Down Under has a good name, and since there are no language barriers, parents don’t have to worry about finding an international school for their children. There are, however, the usual choices between state and private schools, but both demand full-time attendance from the age of six to either 15 or 16. Schools tend to be run by the individual state governments rather than by the national government, but pre-schools are unregulated. Tertiary education students are charged higher education fees unless they are Australian citizens.

, In the cities public transport is of a very high standard, with buses, trains and even trams in some places, available on tap. Taxis are also available, for a relatively low cost. Once you leave the city centres however, be prepared to navigate huge distances if you are travelling by road – you will undoubtedly find it easier to take an internal flight if you are travelling from one end of the country to the other. Long distance buses offer a cheaper alternative to flying, as do interstate trains which often provide unbeatable scenery.


If you are planning on staying in Australia for a while it is advisable to hire, or even buy, a car. This can be an expensive process, due to the amount of vehicles that are imported, but if you are after a second-hand car you’ll find that it offers much better value for money. British driving licences are valid for a year – if you are staying for longer than 12 months in one stretch you will need to apply for an Australian licence by taking a driving test.

Sit for the citizenship test and score 75% or higher.",How to Become an Australian Citizen," Citizenship in Australia can be by birth, descent, or conferral. This means that you will need to weigh your options. Do you qualify for any of these categories? Try consulting the Australian government's online resources.


Visit the government's Citizenship Wizard at https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Citi/Appl/Citizenship-wizard to begin. This simple questionnaire will help you determine what pathways – if any – are open to you. Work through the pathways online.
You may qualify to apply immediately or even already be a citizen. In this case you would either be eligible by birth or descent. That is, you would qualify because you were born in Australia or meet other specific criteria.;
, Write down the recommendations you find on government websites as well as the forms you’ll need to fill out. Print out the necessary forms if you can apply for citizenship now and get the ball rolling. Make sure to collect documents along the way. You may need to prove things like your parents' citizenship or permanent residency or even the times that they lived in Australia. If you were born in Australia, you may also need to prove that you spent a period of two or more years in the country.


If you don’t have this information on record, you can request birth certificates, citizenship records and other official info from local Australian government offices.
Legally accepted documents for proving citizenship include passports, birth certificates issued in Australia, naturalization certificates, and certificates of citizenship by descent., If you cannot apply for citizenship immediately, you will need to work toward permanent residency in order to be eligible. An immigration lawyer can help you determine the best strategy for achieving citizenship within the next four years. Keep in mind that this will not be a cheap process, though. Visa fees range from $3,600 for employer sponsored workers to over $6,000 for spousal sponsorships and are listed on the Government's website at https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa/Fees/. Lawyer fees will add to even more.

, If you were born in Australia between 1949 and 1986, you probably already have citizenship. During that time Australia gave it automatically at birth based on the legal principle of jus soli. If born in Australia after 1986, however, it gets more complicated. In that case everything depends on whether at least one of your parents was a citizen or permanent resident.Jus soli applied even if your parents were visitors or foreigners. With a few exceptions, anyone born in Australia between 1949 and 1986 acquired citizenship automatically at birth., Since 1986, you become a citizen so long as you are born in Australian territory and at least one of your parents is an Australian citizen or permanent resident on your birth.If born overseas to at least one Australian citizen parent, you do not get citizenship automatically but are eligible to apply for it through descent.If born overseas to an Australian permanent resident parent, you are NOT eligible to apply for citizenship through descent., This is another way that you may already have gotten citizenship through birth., If you qualify for citizenship by birth, all you need to do is apply for proof of Australian citizenship. This will require you to submit an official application form.Gather up all the documents you need to show where and when you were born, such as a birth certificate, or to show your parents' legal status in Australia.


You will need to get copies of the original documents, certified by an Australian citizen who is not related to you by birth.Then send off the completed application with all supporting documents and fees.

, If you have at least one parent who was an Australian citizen at the time or your birth, but you do not meet the other criteria for citizenship by birth, you can claim citizenship through descent. For example, you can apply for citizenship if you were born overseas to Australian parents and the said parents spent at least two years of their lives in Australia.To claim citizenship by descent, your parents cannot have a citizen or national of another country.If over 18, you will also have to show that you are of “good character.” This judgement is made on the basis of your past criminal record, but also on whether the government deems you to be a risk to safety, security, and stability in Australia., You will again need to prove that you are eligible for this pathway. This will include proof of your identity, proof of your parents' Australian citizenship, and a character assessment covering your employment history, education, criminal background, and military serviceMake sure to follow the government's instructions carefully.

, Depending on whether you are applying online or by mail, you will have to either scan your documents or have them certified by an Australian citizen not related to you by birth, marriage, or “de facto” relationship.”, Your citizenship will start on the date that the application is approved and there is no need for you to attend a citizenship ceremony., You can work toward residency in several ways, including through skilled migration, spousal sponsorship, employer sponsored migration, or school. Once you have legal residency, you can eventually apply for full citizenship in Australia. An immigration lawyer can tell you what visa is best for your situation.


Australia currently detains anyone caught in the country without a visa and processes undocumented asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea. It also limits refugees to temporary 3 to 5 year visas. Refugees are not eligible for permanent residency., In 2013/14 Australia had 128,550 slots for immigrants with skilled occupations.Check the current list of skilled jobs to see whether you fit under one of the 188 different occupations. You may be able to use this to gain residency and, eventually, citizenship for your family as well.


For this type of visa you will need to submit a skills test. There is also an English language requirement., Another way to apply for residency is to have a company hire you and nominate you for a visa. The employer has to verify that they have a job for at least two years for you, and, if accepted, you will be required to spend at least two years in that position.Be aware, again, of age, skill, and language requirements for this stream.

, If you are married to an Australian citizen or permanent resident, they are entitled to sponsor you as an immigrant. You will need to submit two separate forms for this application - one for the sponsor and one for you - as well as documents to prove your identity, attest your relationship, and show that your spouse can meet his obligations as a sponsor. You will therefore have to provide certified copies of your passport and birth certificate, bank statements (your spouse must be able to support you for two years), a criminal background check, and even ""evidence"" of your relationship like letters, photos, emails, and joint bills., Still another way to gain residency is to come initially as a student. Students can oftentimes remain in Australia after their studies end and become residents. Research the best fit from your home country, in order to find a program of study that will last at least two years. As with work visas, your school will need to sponsor you.

, The graduate visa is a sort of bridge to permanent residency. It is valid for 18 months and allows you to gain the 12 months of full-time experience needed to qualify for skilled migration. Alternately, it can allow you to find a sponsor employer.You must apply for the graduate visa within six months of finishing your program. You also cannot be more than 50 years old.

, After completing your graduate program or holding a job for two years in Australia, you can apply for a permanent skilled migration visa. You must be able to show that you worked for at least 12 months during this time., You are eligible to become a citizen if you have lived in Australia for at least four years and have been lived a permanent resident for at least one year. You must also have been physically present in Australia for three out of the last four years, be of “good character” (i.e. minimal criminal record), and understand the duties of citizenship like following the law, voting, paying taxes, and, if need be, defending the country.Use the the government's Residence Calculator at http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Ente/Retu/residence-calculator/ to see if you meet these requirements.

, Absences from the country cannot be greater than three months. Also, be sure that you have not been out of the country for longer than 12 months during the previous four years., If you've followed this path, you will be eligible under the “Migrant with Permanent Residence” stream.Seek help from an immigration lawyer to navigate the necessary documentation.

, You will need to provide documents to the Australian authorities that prove your identity, show any links between other names in your application, and demonstrate your good character. These include your photo and signature, your current address, proof of identity like a birth certificate or passport, and criminal background check certificates. These documents must be originals., Once you have passed the initial application process, you can sit for the citizenship test. This is a 20-question multiple-choice test taken in English, in which you will be asked about Australia, its people, government and law, and democratic beliefs and values. Study for the test using the book recommended by the government: Australian Citizenship: Our Common Bond.You will receive word if you’ve met the requirement and your citizenship has been accepted. You will then be inducted as a citizen during an official ceremony.


Not everyone has sit for this test, including minors, people over age 60, or people with physical handicaps.

Move two steps to the right.,
Put your arms into position.",How to Dance Hula1,"









If it helps, sway your hips from side to side.;
, Follow with the left foot on each step. Then move two steps to the left, following with the right foot on each step.









When you step the first foot, lead with your hip. When the next foot comes to follow it, let that hip sink. This creates a rocking motion with your hips every time you move.

, Traditionally, you will put up the arm that corresponds with the leading foot. The arm will come straight out to the side, at shoulder height. The other hand will be pointing toward the leading hand at the center of your chest, with your elbow at shoulder height.


When you switch your leading foot, you will switch the position of your arms so that the extended arm corresponds with the leading foot.

Put your hands in position.",How to Dance Hula2," Don’t squat, but keep a significant bend in your knees. Keep your hips very loose.









You should be bending enough for a noticeable change in your height, but not so much that you are using a lot of thigh strength to keep yourself in position.

, Relax your left hip down. Then repeat on the other side.









Your head should be completely level. It may move side to side, but never up and down. Concentrate all of your movement on the shifting weight in your legs, and the swaying of your hips.
Once you are ready, lift your feet every time the weight shifts off of them.

, Traditionally, the position for the kao step is to keep both of your hands at chest height, palms towards the ground and fingertips facing each other.

Shift your weight from the center to your right foot.,
Add the arm positioning.",How to Dance Hula3," Lift your tailbone, so that your butt is elevated, but try not to push your belly forward. Try to imagine your hips as separate from your torso. They should be a little further back and higher than normal, but your torso and chest should not tilt too much to accommodate them.

, This is like the Kao step, except that instead of shifting back to left immediately, you will bring your weight to center, and then shift your weight to the left. Do this for four counts. Then, repeat in the other direction, with your first weight shift going from center to left.









Imagine making circles with your butt. The rest of your body will stay static, but your butt and hips will move in circles going clockwise for four counts, then counter clockwise for four counts.

, The hand that corresponds with the leading hip should be in the middle of your chest, with the palm pointed toward the floor. Your elbow should be bent and at shoulder height, going straight to the side. The other hand should be on the other hip.

Look for the Diamond Head sign. If you're taking the bus from Waikiki, take routes 1, 3, 22 (does not run on Tuesdays), and 23. There is a bus stop right in front of the entrance, so inform the bus driver that you're going to Diamond Head & be on alert when you go up the hill.;
, Pedestrians can walk on the dirt/rock path (on the side of oncoming traffic) instead of the actual road. Be sure to stop at the first scenic point before heading into the tunnel. This point views the Kahala district.

, There is a limited space for pedestrians. Always drive slow and have vehicle headlights on.

, The entrance fees are $1 per pedestrian, $5 each car, $10 for commercial cars/vans, $20 for mini-buses, and $40 for buses. If available, you can also grab a trail map, along with a ticket stub for your fee.

, Not only that a person can learn about the trail, but also discover Diamond Head's history and its usage in World War I. There are water fountains and a restroom facility nearby.

, It starts off as a paved cement path, leads to dirt, and then rocks. Beginning at the first height increment, metal guard rails are placed for safety. Before you get to the top, there are two other scenic areas to view from. Numerous benches are placed along the trail and there are other places to step aside for people to take a breath.

When you finalize a hotel room, research what nearby attractions are in walking distance.",How to Choose a Hawaiian Island Vacation Spot," You may want to have The State of Hawaii's official website as a key starter.;
, Be sure to include factors, such as weather, hotel costs, tourist attractions, restaurants, shopping malls, yearly events for specific islands, etc.

, How much are you willing to spend for a hotel room? How much are you willing to spend for souvenirs? Are you planning to use a rental car or city transportation? How much are you willing to spend overall for attractions?

, For example, Waikiki, Oahu has countless ideas for a tourist, including Waikiki Beach, Ala Moana Shopping Center, Honolulu Zoo, Waikiki Shell, Waikiki Aquarium, and Kapiolani Park.

"
"
Bodyboard (or surf) here only if you are at least at an intermediate level.,
Drive over on Ala Moana Blvd to Ala Moana Park and into Ala Moana Park Drive where there is free parking.,
Park close to the tennis courts, inside the park, on Ala Moana Park Drive or in the parking lot next to the tennis court.

,
Observe the break and the paddling channel from shore.,

Paddle out, crossing the dredged swimming channel (that is parallel to the beach) and over the shallow inside reef of the break.,
Once at the lineup, contend with the trade winds - which comes from the east (Waikiki).,
The inside reef is not dangerous, ride the waves until they die out if you want to.,
In shallow water always stay on the board and do not worry about sea urchins here.,
If you walked to the park, bury your sandals in the sand or leave them by the lifeguard tower.,
There are showers, restrooms and a snack bar at the park.",How to Bodyboard at Tennis Courts in Honolulu," If you are a beginner, learn at ""The Wall"" which is below the Honolulu Zoo. Tennis Courts has slightly bigger waves than The Wall and there is a paddle out.;
, This park is between Ala Moana Shopping Center and the ocean.

,,


Directly outside and to the right (your right if your are facing the ocean) of the tennis courts is ""Tennis Courts"". To the west is ""Concessions"" and then ""Big Rights"". Tennis Courts is the break with fewer people out there. Courts has a long but make-able right and the left is just a drop and totally unremarkable. Big Rights is bigger and more crowded. Tennis Courts closes out at about six feet.
Watch how surfers and body boarders got out to the lineup. This is not like Kuhio Beach, in Waikiki, where spectators crowd the beach. Going out to the lineup will take a few minutes. If the tide is low, you will see board surfers walking out on paths on the shallow reefs that surfers have walked on for decades.

, When paddling out, head to the left (your left) of the break. Body boarders can almost always paddle out except for when the tides are low. When the water is shallow, stay in the flat position and take shallow strokes with your arms. Propel yourself, with just your arms, until the water gets deeper.






The photo was taken when the tide was very low and the waves were just a foot. Inside of the four rocks is the swimming channel and outside of the rocks, where the water is brown, is the inside reef.

, Merely sitting on the board with your back to the trade winds is enough to hold your position. When sitting on the board, use your fins with just your legs finning against the current. Waikiki close by is a windbreak.

, However, ride the wave all the way in only when your are headed back to the beach: you do not want to scratch the underside of your board on coral. Do not worry about getting cut from coral reefs, Courts is a mild and safe break. The water gradually gets deep and when you are riding a wave, there will be no reefs that will suddenly appear out of nowhere. ""Public"" surf break in Waikiki is where you should watch out for shallow reefs on the inside. If the tide is very low the reefs will show, but they are not life threatening here. Ala Moana is a man-made beach so even the inside reefs are user friendly.

, Where there is wave action the long spine sea urchins are not present. There are short-spine sea urchins on the reef but nowhere close to the amount you would notice in the country. These short spine are in the holes of the reefs, and will not hurt you unless you start walking with your fins on the reef. Stay on the board, paddle with shallow strokes and you won't get poked by sea urchins or get cut on the coral. Once you get past the beginner's level in body boarding, and stay in deeper water for the most part, the dangers of the reef like coral cuts and sea urchin pokes practically disappear.

, If you have any questions, ask the lifeguard. Use surf shorts that have pockets that are closed by velcro to secure your keys and wallet.

, This is a safe part of Honolulu to be in, relatively speaking. Have fun.

Visit Circular Quay, home of the iconic Sydney Opera House, and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.",How to Enjoy Sydney Travel," As in all travel, it is highly recommended to pre-book/purchase your accommodation well before your travel date, as is the same in Sydney. Many different types of accommodation (hotels, hostels, apartments, etc) can be easily found in Sydney's CBD, conveniently walking distance from Sydney's ""Central"" Railway Station. From here, you can usually take a train to almost anywhere in New South Wales, additionally with the convenient rail link to the domestic and international airports.;
, Despite being a large city, Sydney is relatively easy to navigate on foot given some time to get familiar with your surroundings. If you are travelling short distances in the city, depending on your preference, it is usually recommended to walk instead of taking a train, as the public transport system charges for the stops you make, not travel time as some other states. Day pass and other longer forms of ticket passes are available, but are usually not cost-effective unless you are using several trains each day.

, Again, with most trips you will probably have an itinerary/list of things to do planned out; if you are short on time and want to get really technical, you can look up certain attractions for their opening hours and then estimate how long it will take to visit, and how many you can visit in a day.

, As a small bay well south of Circular Quay, Darling harbor has a great atmosphere, many great restaurants, and an amazing playground for kids. With many attractions located nearby, it is definitely worth visiting

, As the name suggests, the Chinese Garden of Friendship is essentially a Garden dedicated to the Friendship of Sydney and China; well worth the entry fee, it is a privately run Chinese garden with an amazing look and feel, and includes many traditional plants, features, and sculptures.

, At Darling Harbour, there are also three big attractions run by the same company group. Here, you can purchase multi-attraction deals and save a decent amount of money in the process.


The first is Sydney Aquarium, perfect for the family and friends. The Sydney Aquarium lets you walk under water and see the sights of Australia’s rich and diverse marine life and habitats. Sydney Aquarium houses more than 650 species that includes over 6,000 individual fish and other aquatic creatures.
The second, Sydney CBD's Zoo (not to be confused with Taronga Zoo), is a smaller version of a traditional zoo. It is located mostly indoors but is still a zoo worth visiting if you are not able to get to Taronga Zoo or are short on time.
Lastly, the third is Madame Tussauds, a wax figure celebrity museum hosting extremely realistic life size wax figures of a huge range of celebrities and famous personalities, such as John Howard, Taylor Swift, and Einstein. Personal interaction and photographs with the wax figures is encouraged and contributes to a great visiting experience.

, Although is caters more to kids, the Maritime Museum is still worth a visit if you are interested in maritime history and activities, It is the last on this list located near Darling Harbour, though there are likely many more.

, Many great stores and street activities can be found in this area.


Located east of Chinatown, the Powerhouse Museum is a very large science, history and arts museum. It's very entertaining for people of all ages with many highly engaging and interactive exhibits including an enter-able train, train station, space shuttle, and more!
Located east of Central station, Paddy's Markets is a good-sized public market selling anything from clothing to toys and other assorted goods, additionally with a variety of cafes and local food vendors.

, The Sydney Opera House never fails to mesmerize tourists with its splendid and elaborate façade and structure. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Sydney Opera House is one of the most magnificent, unique and popular buildings of the 20th Century.


The Sydney Harbour Bridge is also one of the most famous landmarks not just in Australia but across the globe as well. Sometimes informally called ""the Coathanger"", it links the city centre in the south and the residential north. Thrill-seekers are welcome to the Bridge Climb, a guided walk to the top of the world, or as high as 50-story. The tour is available at dawn, during the day, at twilight or at night.

You may want to consider camping to avoid blowing all of your budget on lodging. Even in the middle of winter, Oahu nights are warm enough to sleep in with a 0 degree sleeping bag or a blanket. The island has a campground on the North East coast that sells camping permits. To find local hosts who might be open to letting you stay with them for free or under certain conditions, meet people on Couchsurfing.com.;
, While traveling Oahu, if you do not have an extra 10 dollars to spend on laundromat service, you may want to consider going to the ocean. Better even, the bathrooms and showers at the beach are open 24/7. They are a great place to do your laundry. Be mindful of what soaps you use, as the drain often leads to the ocean, and many tropical fish inhabit the shoreline...

, China Town is by far the scariest area to sleep in. Street dwellers claim to have had the straps of their backpacks cut off in the middle of the night and to have been repeatedly robbed during their sleep in this area.

, The weather is easy on a year-round basis. For backpackers it can be safer to get out of the city center if you do not want to be bothered. If you are in HawaiiI, you might as well enjoy the unique natural beauty the island has to offer. It is possible to sleep in the woods or on isolated beaches and get away with it for a few weeks.


Just remember that in certain areas, it is not technically legal, so you may want to take an extra while making sure you find a spot that is well hidden from the public eye.

, The federal government is said to have given money to the state of Hawaii to fix its homeless problem. However, the visible changes since seem to have amplified the oppression of these people rather than helped them.


The appearance of the ‘’Don’t Sleep/Don’t Lay’’ law downtown, combined with the threat of $150 + fines and/or imprisonment forbidding shopping carts or tents in most public parks which border tourist attraction, contribute to the difficulty in the daily life of a homeless person in Oahu. Parks and beaches close during sleeping hours (10pm-6-am/ 10pm-4am), which leaves many homeless people resorting to stay up in 24h fast-food places, or to being kicked out for sleeping on the tables, waiting for the sunrise. (This is not dissimilar to the law which imposed a strict curfew on all Oahu residents from years 1962 to 1964.)

, The presence of crystal-meth and mental illness in Honolulu bring handfuls of people to set decrepit installments which act as improvised permanent housing. Structures made of cardboard boxes and shopping carts under dirty, noisy, terrifying overpasses, are a very common sight. The homeless turn into silhouettes roaming with flashlights between the airport and the city at night, searching the grass for what goods may have fallen. Tents can be seen on public sidewalks, and some even sleep on the street without even a blanket, or perhaps only a parasol.

, If you only but just pose your eyes momentarily on the luxurious existence of people enjoying expensive cocktails in resorts, it might place a blow of sadness in the pit of your stomach. You may need to carve mountains out of trash in your mind to stay afloat in your morale with your choice to rough it out in such a touristic spot. You might find yourself second-guessing your style. Just remember: the road less traveled will teach you a lot more about yourself than the one that is paved in gold.

, As a last resort: River of Life (101 N Pauahi street) is a soup kitchen which serves three meals a day for free. At meal times, there will be a small line up on the intersection of N. Pauhi and Manakea steets. The organizers are volunteers and accept employed and un-employed people a-like. Even if you are not a local, a meal will be served to just about anyone who sets foot into their dining room, just as long as you are polite. (Vegetarians may not always be pleased with the meal options.)


You may want to visit a few temples on the outskirts of the city which offer free feasts according to their celebrations.

, Despite being the gracious host to a few important resources, don't count on River of Life to keep an eye on your luggage. Half the people who frequent the place have carriages full of accumulated objects, and the organism wants nothing to do with it. If you are backpacking, you undoubtedly have bags full of minimal camping gear, hygienic, and personal belongings. Some people hide their things at the top of Banyon trees, but these are an easy climb. If you are on good terms with someone, you can possibly leave your bag with them. However, there is so much theft that it's best to avoid trusting anyone off the street. The best option is to travel with a minimal backpack and be near your things at all times.

, Food trucks are mostly on the gourmet side, but it is a hit and miss with a general minimum of 12$ per dish. China Town is probably your best bet in the daylight if you want to purchase cheap groceries or meals from vendors. Honolulu’s enlarging platform for tourism resulted in the hiking up of many restaurant and accommodation costs. However, the appearance of a 5cent per-can remittance at recycling centres has helped not only in cleaning up the city, but in giving people in a hard spot a chance to make ends meet.


It is not uncommon for homeless individuals to mark out areas among themselves and to dedicate considerable portions of their daily schedules to attain this less-than-minimal profit. If you find yourself near a recycling center, you may want to consider putting in a few hours into collecting cans for a bit of extra cash.

, Unlike most things in Honululu, the bus service is affordable. Some consider the investment in a bus pass ($60) a good solution, if it means sleeping away from harassment from civilians and fines from the police. Beaches such as Sandy Beach or Halei’wa are located in areas where it is easy to set up a subtle camping spot. . You can find local fruit stands on the North Coast which will be cheaper than eating out in the downtown areas. The bus can take you around the island for as little $2.50 a day if you time your connections properly.

, Oahu is full of free activities. Be creative with the way you spend your time. Go to free museums, read a book on the beach, write to friends, visit the power plant, go hiking, find hidden trails, discover the library, explore abandoned buildings, find buddhist temples... Who knows, you might even find joy in writing an article about your experiences in Honolulu.

Plate lunches come with scoops of rice, a main entrée consisting of a meat or vegetarian alternative, and vegetable/pasta salad. Try items that you are not accustomed to; they will be prepared in ways traditional to Hawaiian custom.
, The most popular local restaurant in Hawaii is Zippy's. ""Zip Packs"" and chili plates are among the favorite foods. L&L or Rainbow Drive Inn are other popular restaurants. Go to Tropical Taco instead of Taco Bell. Get coffee at a local coffee shop rather than Starbucks. Eat breakfast at Ken's House of Pancakes or Koa Pancake rather than settling for IHOP for your favorite pancakes. Instead of your regular Baskin Robbins, go to Lappert's ice cream., Drive to the North Shore/Haleiwa for the famous shave ice. Buy produce at a farmer's market instead of going to the supermarket. Have bento instead of a sandwich., Spam musubis can be found at every 7-11 and in most places that sell plate lunches. Look for furikake or mochi with popcorn for a snack. Even McDonald's offers a locally inspired breakfast consisting of rice, eggs, and Portuguese sausage., The most popular party snack is ahi or tako poke. Sashimi and sushi are more popular on the islands than cooked fish. If you don't like seafood, you can stop by a sushi bar where they'll offer non-fish items, such as vegetables or meat, wrapped in the same sushi style. Just because it's Japanese food doesn't mean it won't be prepared in a way unique to the Hawaiian islands!, Haupia (coconut pudding) is a famous dessert in Hawaiian luaus (a chocolate haupia pie is shown here). Go to a local snack shop and try some li hing mui (salty dried plum). You can buy either the seeded or seedless version of the plum. You can also get a powder to dunk goodies (such as gummy worms or gummy bears) in., This treat is made from the taro plant, which was introduced and eaten for several centuries by the first people who arrived in Hawaii for around 400 AD. It remains a favorite among the locals to this day. Look for freshly made poi (or make it yourself by mixing cooked taro root with water) and expect a delicate flavor. If the poi is a few days old, eat it with salted fish or lomi salmon on the side. If you're feeling ambitious, use it to make bread. Though many locals eat poi by itself, few non-locals enjoy it alone. Try it instead as a gravy on kalula pork and cabbage or laulau., On Kauai, a group called Sunshine Market runs many markets. Only small local growers are allowed to sell, and you can get everything from coconuts and fruit to ferns and flowers fresh and at very reasonable prices. Make sure to get there early - there will be a line and stalls sell out quickly., Various dishes and crops became integrated into the Hawaiian diet as the population and economy changed. The food you encounter is a result of a unique cultural medley.
Polynesian seafarers planted taro, sweet potatoes, yams, breadfruit, baking banana, coconuts and sugarcane. They brought and ate pigs, chickens, and dogs and cooked them in earth ovens called imu.
Captain George Vancouver brought cattle to Hawaii in 1793. They multiplied, were domesticated, and became part of Hawaiian cuisine.
Don Francisco de Paula Marin, a Spanish botanist and advisor to King Kamehameha I, grew the first pineapples and grapes and brewed the first beer in the early 1800s.
Chinese immigrants introduced stir fry, sweet and sour, and dim sum; replaced poi with rice
Whalers brought salted fish (later became lomi-lomi salmon)
Korean immigrants brought kimchi and barbecue pits to cook marinated meats
Portuguese immigrants put more emphasis on pork, tomatoes, and chili peppers. They also introduced forno, their traditional beehive oven, for Pão Doce, the Portuguese sweet bread and malasada
Japanese immigrants brought bento and sashimi; tofu and soy sauce; tempura and noodle soups
Puerto Rican immigrants made spicy, Spanish-seasoned thick soups, casseroles, and meat turnovers popular dishes.
Filipino immigrants introduced peas and beans, the adobo style of vinegar and garlic dishes, and sweet potatoes instead of rice
Samoans built earth ovens above ground and made poi from fruit instead of taro
Thai and Vietnamese immigrants brought Southeast Asian lemongrass, fish sauce and galangal
American servicemen brought Spam in their rations, and it became a good source of protein when fishing wasn't allowed during WWII. Now Hawaii is one of the biggest consumers of Spam in the world.

, In New Zealand, the left lane is the slow lane and the right lane is the fast lane - try to keep to the left lane on multi-laned roads as much as possible.

, The speed limits in New Zealand are measured in kilometers per hour and are indicated by European-style speed limit signs. The open road limit is 100 km/h (62 mph), while in built-up areas, the speed limit is 50 km/h (31 mph). Watch out for advisory speed limits on corners and temporary speed limits at construction sites.


The police in New Zealand enforce these limits strictly!

Don't restrict yourself to just the South Island or just the North Island.",How to Travel Around New Zealand With Less Money and More Fun," New Zealanders are friendly people and will readily talk to you. Take time to talk to them and to inquire about the most interesting places to visit that they know about. They'll tell you of things the guidebook hasn't a clue about.;
, When you are in a small town, you can go to the library. There, you will find internet access. However, your time will be limited, and it's not always free. New Zealand is catching up with free internet access via wi-fi for tourists and it is now available in shopping malls, the street, parks and reserves, restaurants and cafes and some shops. Check your device to see if there are networks you can access, you'll be surprised some times....but maybe disappointed if you are out in the Wop Wops. Improvements in the service the are being discussed, and coverage is getting better every day.

, Many towns have museums, activity centres, kid's entertainment, etc. There are often outdoor activities located indoors too, such as rock climbing. There are great visitor facilities near areas that get rained on a lot too, such as near the Franz Josef and Fox glaciers. New Zealanders, or Kiwis, know how to make the most of everything and are conscious that the rain can blight a tourist's visit, so have provided plenty of great alternatives. The West Coast of the South Island has a terrible reputation for bein rainy but can be glorious. Be prepared to take a chance.

, Courtenay Place and Cuba Street are good places to hang out in. Follow the interesting people; and again, strike up a conversation to find out more great places to visit and perhaps you'll learn about more events to go to.

, When it rains, when it seems like you can't stand yet another RV in front of you, when the sun refuses to grace your outdoor activities, just smile, don a raincoat and get on with enjoying one of the lushest, greenest places in the world with some of the friendliest people about!

, Reserves are outdoor areas where the native plants and wildlife are managed or where gardens and sports fields are. The nature Reserves are the most interesting with such things as flora and fauna, landscapes, caves, waterfalls, sites of historical interest etc to marvel at, all completely free! Usually with free parking and public conveniences too.

, White Bait Fritters, Feijoa and of course kiwi fruit are all NZ produced so great value for money. You may even be able to catch or pick your own.

, Visit both if possible. You don't have to fly, there is a Ferry Service. Remember, glorious sunsets are completely free!

Consider going by buses or matruskas (mini buses).,
Try to stay at least three nights in Yerevan.,
Ensure that you have sufficient time for doing this.",How to Travel from Turkey to Armenia," Istanbul, Turkey is home to two large airports, both of which offer inexpensive flights to the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi.  You can choose either Ataturk Airport on the European side, easily reachable by mass transportation or Sabiha Gokcen on the Asian side of Istanbul.  Turkish Airlines, Pegasus, and Atlas Jet are usually the best options.  The flight is approximately 2 hours and can usually be found for around $100-150 USD roundtrip.


The most inexpensive flight times depart Istanbul late in the evenings and return from Tbilisi early in the mornings. Many nationalities require no visa or visa on arrival for both Georgia and Armenia.;
, Once you arrive in Tbilisi, you have a few options to make the 5 hour journey to the capital of Armenia, Yerevan.  Though, if time allows, Tbilisi is a fascinating city to visit as well and has both Turkish and Armenian influences.  Assuming you want to begin your journey from Tbilisi to Yerevan as soon as possible, you can rent a car (Naniko Car Rental www.naniko.com is familiar with the paperwork necessary to drive the car across the Armenian border and back for approximately $70 USD per day as of May, 2015).  


Make sure that you inform the rental agency of your plans to cross the border at least a week in advance so the proper paperwork can be prepared.  
Once you are at the border, you will pay an additional $10-15 USD to the Armenian border officials to take your rental car across.

,  Leaving baggage claim at the Tbilisi Airport, you can take a taxi to Freedom Square or Envoy Hostel directly for 25 GEL (approx. $11 USD)  For first time visitors to Armenia, this is a highly recommended way to travel that includes a traditional Armenian BBQ lunch, a snack, and two UNESCO world heritage listed sites on the way down to Yerevan.  It's approximately 11 hours, but well worth it for the excellent price of approximately $60 USD per person (as at May 2015).

, The train to Armenia from Tbilisi is much cheaper and includes an overnight sleeper train that takes approximately 9 hours. It costs approximately 31 GEL (approx. $13 USD).

, The ticket prices are from approx. $10-20 USD depending on how fast you want to go, with matruskas being the usually shortest time option.


There are other options, such as hitchhiking (though language barriers will probably be an issue, or even individually arranging with a taxi driver to drive you down to Yerevan or vice versa to Tbilisi.

,  There are many important tourist sites located just outside the city that you will not want to miss.  Within Yerevan, there are many art exhibits, a great artists' market, and museums.  Just relaxing with a cool drink in a themed cafe within a Yerevan park is an experience in of itself.  


Airbnb is a great, inexpensive option for both Tbilisi and Yerevan, as well as Envoy Hostel, because they have locations in both cities, offer tours, and are well-versed in the local history and cultures of both countries.  
Bear in mind that there are not many 4 and 5 star hotels in either city.  If you happen to visit during important events like the April 24th commemorations in Yerevan, airbnb.com is your best option for finding well appointed, reasonably priced accommodations for approx. $50USD per night.

, Five days will do for the short trip to Armenia via Tbilisi, Georgia.  You won't regret it.

Travel from Cairo to the Giza Pyramids.,
Determine your budget.,
Be ready to bargain.",How to Rent a Camel in Cairo," The Cairo camel rental process begins with a ride to the Pyramids. The pyramid site is approximately 14 miles (23 km) from Cairo International Airport (CAI). Inexpensive, air-conditioned buses are available about every 20 minutes. You may also take a taxi from nearly anywhere in the city. You're less likely to have to haggle for a better price in the yellow taxis or on a bus than in the black-and-white taxis.;
, A trip on a pre-arranged tour is more expensive than a walk-up trip. Your package tour may also include a camel-riding experience.

If you're planning to go on a professional tour of Egypt and the Middle East, check with the tour operator to determine if the tour includes a tour of the pyramids riding camels. If it does, someone else will handle the legwork for you. This is certainly the easiest, though also the most expensive option for renting a camel in Cairo.
Several companies offer advance reservations for day trips that include camel-riding pyramid tours. These packages often include transportation from Cairo, several hours of camel riding, refreshments, and a tour guide. They tend to cost around US$100, but are usually reputable.
You can hire a camel after you have arrived at the pyramids. Be wary. Camel rental agencies have reputations of trying to take advantage of unsuspecting tourists. Some stories involve forcing people who rent a camel to pay a second fee to get off of the camel or repeatedly placing costume pieces (such as a Lawrence of Arabia-style turban) onto a renter just before taking a picture, and then asking for a ""costume-rental fee.""







, Like many services in Cairo, camel rental gets cheaper the better you are at bargaining. You should expect to pay around 40 Egyptian Pounds (US$7) for an on-site camel rental, though good prices range from 30 to 50 Egyptian Pounds ($5-8).

The kids will love it. And at the top there's a café, the Wellington Museum and a cable car museum. There are also lookout points over Wellington which are definitely worth lingering for (take your camera).;
, Te Papa is an excellent free admission museum down on the waterfront. There are children's programs on weekends and during school holidays . The Discovery Place is excellent fun and there is a great kid's store with New Zealand storybooks for kids being a key feature, along with toys. Storyplace is for kids aged 5 and under.

, This is a fenced and mostly predator-free sanctuary where kids can roam and see over 30 native bird species and the wonderful weta insect. The rare giant weta is also found here. The kids will also get to see native forest and bushland and can participate in special events.

, There are plenty of great playgrounds along the waterfront. Kids can also rollerblade or cycle around the waterfront paths. Check out the giant slippery dip; even adults make excuses to try this one out.

Citizens of the United States and all EU member states qualify for free visit visas at United Arab Emirates airports or other points of entry. They last for 30 days. That means you don’t need to get a visa in advance of arriving in Dubai.If you are a citizen of a Gulf Cooperation Council country, you don’t need a visa at all and could also qualify for a visa for domestic help. GCC countries are countries along the Arabian peninsula. These countries include: Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia.
If you are from a country not on that list of 33 and aren't from a GCC country, you may still get a day tourist visa, depending on the country you are from, but it needs to be sponsored by a local entity, like a hotel or a tour operator, and you should get the visa before entering Dubai. Check with your embassy before traveling to Dubai because the list of countries not requiring a pre-visa or sponsor can change.;
, If you’re not from America, the EU or a few other countries, you will need to find the sponsor to apply for a visa for you.


Valid sponsors include hotel and tourist companies, airlines and airline handlers, organizations based in the United Arab Emirates, and some individuals who already live there.

You must present passport and travel documents. If you are from Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Niger, or Yemen, you don’t qualify for a transit visa.
Airlines often arrange these transit visas for their passengers.

, If you will be attending a licensed university or educational institution in the country, that institution could sponsor you for a student visa.

Avoid banned items.,
Dress correctly to enter a mosque.,
Wear the right clothes to restaurants or bars.,
Wear the right clothes when working out.,
Wear the right swimwear.,
Handle criticism well.,
Follow rules for public displays of affection as well.",How to Dress in Dubai," The dress code in Dubai does not apply to your own home or inside your hotel room. You can wear whatever you want there. However, it does apply to public places.


Examples of public places where the dress code applies include theaters, markets, malls, supermarkets, and the public areas of hotels.
When you are inside your car driving on a public roadway, the dress code still applies. You may be given an abaya to wear when you visit an official government building or courts. This is a piece of clothing that covers what you are wearing.;
, They may not be what you’re used to, but they show cultural respect and will stop you from getting into trouble.


The general rule is that you should cover everything from your shoulders to your knees. Avoid showing cleavage, and watch clothing that is tight or see through. Women should not wear sleeveless garments.
For men, this means you should not show your bare chest in public. Avoid shorts, especially short ones, and don’t wear swimwear outside of the pool or beach area. Don’t unbutton your shirt to show chest hair. Men should not show their knees, either., There are certain pieces of clothing that comply with the dress code. So you might want to pack a lot of them.


Pashmina shawls can be used to cover up, including in your car.Capri pants will keep your legs cool but still cover up enough. A scarf is a good idea when visiting a mosque. T-shirts are fine. Spaghetti strap tops aren’t a good idea.Leggings can be work under short dresses to cover the legs. Cardigans are a good choice for covering the shoulders. However, don’t wear leggings as your only pants.

, You’re going to be in trouble if you choose certain clothing items in Dubai, so it’s best to avoid them completely.


Daisy Duke shorts, very short mini-skirts, tube tops, crop tops and mesh dresses can violate the dress code.
Cover underwear, and keep it from public view. Under no circumstances, should your underwear be visible in public. G-strings, bras, and underwear briefs that show through clothing will violate the dress code.
Lycra body dresses and very short playsuits also might get you in trouble. The same is true of clothing with see through fabric or cut outs., If you want to go inside a mosque, there are very strict rules for your entrance. You might not be allowed in the mosque in the first place if you are a non-Muslim.


You might be provided with clothing you can put over your clothes, called an abaya for a woman and kandourah for men. You will be asked to remove your shoes.
Women must cover the hair and entire body. Men don’t have to cover the hair but should not wear shorts or sleeveless shirts.

, Many upscale restaurants, especially those that sell alcohol, will require men to wear covered shoes and long trousers.


For women, it’s a good idea not to show cleavage or thighs, although sandals are fine.
The dress code is generally looser at nightclubs or bars. Malls have signs instructing customers to cover their shoulders and knees. , You may need to know what to wear to the the gym or while running.


You can wear normal workout gear in a hotel or private gym. When running outside, wear longer shorts and a lightweight top if you are male.
Women can get away with wearing running leggings as long as they go past the knee.

, It’s allowed to wear bikinis and swimsuits around pools or when you are at the beach, but there are some limitations.


Don’t wear thong swim suit bottoms. Change your swimwear before you leave the pool or beach area and, say, go into a store. It’s a violation of the dress code to wear wet swimsuits under clothing if the clothing then becomes see through.
Topless sunbathing is not allowed in Dubai; in fact, it’s illegal. Choosing a one-piece swimming suit is probably a good idea. At public beaches, wearing a T-shirt and shorts is a better idea., You may find that various people, ranging from security guards to colleagues, might suggest your dress is offensive. Sometimes such people are trying to help you by providing advice.


It’s best to remain calm and apologize. If possible, you could say you will go back to the hotel or home to change.
The problem with getting angry or resisting this change is that the police could get involved then, and you don’t want that. You could just throw a Pashmina shawl around your shoulders and avoid a stickier situation.

, In addition to dress, keep public displays of affection for private times. It’s all about Dubai’s cultural modesty requirements.


Don’t hold hands, hug, or make out in public.Be aware that Islamic women in Dubai might not appreciate a handshake or eye contact.
A British couple was jailed for a month because they kissed each other in public. You could be arrested for offending public decency especially if the complaining person is Muslim and a citizen of the United Arab Emirates. You could be deported or end up with a month in jail. "

When planning, keep the weather in mind.,
Go to safe areas.,
Never travel alone for safety reasons.,
Stay with a trusted relative or in reputable hotel.,
Carry necessary medicines with you.,
Boil your drinking water.,
Before shopping always check prices from at least three shops.,
Always ask for a cheaper fair to travel.,
Do not travel to deserted areas at any time.,
Women must be fully covered.,
Be cautious about the food.,
Avoid ceremonies, gatherings and public processions.,
Never trust a stranger on any matter.,
Avoid online business of any kind.",How to Safely Travel to Pakistan," Summer time is never good as the temperature goes up to 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The other parts are also too warm to bear for a person not used to warm weather. So, plan your trip in winter, which is usually from October to February.;
, In Islamabad, Karachi, and Quetta, there is some trouble. However,it is safe to visit Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, and other areas of the Punjab.

, In Pakistan, people can take advantage of you if you are alone, so it is best to travel in a group.

, Consider staying in a class one or 4-5 star hotel. These hotels have their own security so they are safer.

, Before going to Pakistan, consult your G.P (general practitioner) and ask about the medicines you would need over there. Especially take precautions for Malaria, typhoid, Hepatitis C, and other ailments. Pakistan is not exactly the cleanliest place, so it is easy for people with weaker immune systems to fall ill.

, In Pakistan, even the bottled water is not safe to drink. So plan for the water -- either take some unit to clean the water or boil the tap water at your kitchen.

, In Pakistan, people bargain a lot and you have to be very vigilant when buying something. Never trust anyone in the matters of pricing. Always check the prices from other store keepers and then buy.

, When you are in Pakistan, you will need a taxi, rickshaw, or auto to travel, so I suggest asking for a lower pricing. People usually charge a lot from foreigners; try to look like you fit in for the sake of your wallet.

, Security is not always at its best here. Please do not visit far off, deserted and barren areas--especially in the evenings and nights.

, In Pakistan, women are not allowed to wear modern dresses to walk and move around. Although, some do dare to wear what they like, but they put themselves in danger! Culture dictates that women cover themselves from the eyes of men, so wearing a pair of shorts and a tank top is not your best clothing option.

, You cannot go to just any place to eat. Either cook your own food to be safe or go to a reputable restaurant. Pakistani food is wonderful, but if you order a dish from a poor shack, your defense against disease better be flawless.

, When you are in the country, please avoid all types of gatherings, rush, or celebrations. Nowadays, it is not safe to become a part of any group--you might become a victim of reckless behavior.

, In Pakistan, people may hide their identities and try to cheat you. Be careful and vigilant at all times.

, In Pakistan online business is not secure. If you need to buy something, buy it on the store; if you want to rent a room, meet the persons face to face; and if you want to transfer the money, go to the bank personally. You might use an ATM card, but with extreme caution and vigilance to be safe and secure.

Get a letter-size (or A4) piece of paper.,
Turn the paper to the side that is white.,
Fold the bottom part of the paper in half.,
Unfold the top part of the paper.,
Make a horizontal fold.,
Turn the paper over again.,
Fold the bottom left corner of the top triangle so it meets the top point.,
Fold over the sides to meet the diamond.,
Create a vertical crease.,
Fold up the bottom corners.,
Fold down the top flap.,
Tuck the corners.,
Fold down the top points.,
Tuck the corners again.,
Check the finished heart.",How to Make an Origami Heart," You can also use a square 6” x 6” (15 cm x 15 cm) piece of origami paper. Thinner paper is preferable as thicker paper is harder to work with and doesn’t always stay folded.








Avoid using small pieces of paper on your first try, as the folds will be more difficult to make and this may be frustrating. If you’d like to make a larger sized heart, use a larger piece of paper.
If you decide to draw a design, split it in half; it will end up in the center of the heart. A decoration can be added when the heart is finished as well.;
, Then, fold the top right corner downwards so that it meets the left side of the paper. Unfold it, and do the same thing to the opposite corner; do not unfold.









If you are using A4 paper as opposed to origami paper (which has a white side), don't worry about turning the paper to the side that is white.

, Do this so that the white (or inside part of the paper) doesn't show anymore.









Make sharp folds by sliding your nail over each fold. Neat, sharp folds will make your final product look better.

, You should now have two diagonal creases on the paper.







, Fold the top part down horizontally, so that the fold crosses the intersection in the middle of the paper. Then, unfold it.








, Take the left and right sides of the paper (where the horizontal crease is) and pull them toward the center of the paper. As you pull them, the other two creases should be folding, too. Pull the two sides inwards so they touch.









It can take several tries to create the pyramid shape, especially if you are new to origami. You should end up with what looks like a triangle sitting on top of the rectangular portion at the bottom.

, Only fold the top layer, not both layers of paper. Make the same fold on the other side; you should now have a diamond shape.








, Grab the left side of the paper, and fold everything that's not part of the diamond you made in the previous step toward the center. Do the same for the other side.








, Fold the entire thing in half vertically, then unfold it and turn it over.








, Take the two bottom corners and fold them upwards, so they meet at the center. Fold them so that what was once the bottom edge lines up with the vertical line running down the center.








, Fold the large triangular flap at the top downward, as far as it can go before running into a horizontal line. At the top there should now be three individual flaps, two small ones and a big one. Fold the big one down.








, Tuck the two corners that you folded up from the bottom into the space inside the triangular flap.








, Fold the two remaining top flaps downwards at an angle.








, Tuck the corners of those flaps into the space in the big flap.








, You should now have an origami heart.

In other words, if one of your parents moved out of New Zealand and you were born elsewhere, you are eligible for this type of citizenship., If you were born in New Zealand but have lived elsewhere, you may already be a citizen by birth. The citizenship office can tell you more, so contact them to find out about the status of your citizenship., You can also gain citizenship this way if you were adopted from another country by parents who were New Zealand citizens. However, you will need to provide more documentation with your application, including your adoption documents., To gain citizenship, you must first have a permanent residency visa. You must have had some form of residency status for 5 years and have lived in New Zealand during that time period.Decide if citizenship by grant is the correct route for you. Most people will need to gain citizenship by grant, as they don't have a parent who's a New Zealand resident. If that's the case, you'll need to meet certain requirements first before you are eligible to be a New Zealand citizen., While you don't need to be fluent enough to write a novel in English, you need to have enough English to be able to make everyday transactions. For instance, you need to know enough to deal with the cashier at the grocery store or the teller at the bank., You can't apply for citizenship in New Zealand with the intention of living elsewhere after you gain citizenship. You must have the intention of staying and making a home in New Zealand., In this case, ""good character"" means not being involved in criminal activities. Mostly, it means larger offenses, such as fraud or other convictions, though even some traffic fines can discredit your eligibility., You'll need your birth certificate, as well as your passport. The passport can be expired. You'll also need two passport photos of yourself. The photos must be identical, in color, and have been taken recently.The application can be found online.

A citizenship officer can be your witness. Whoever acts as the witness must also have a New Zealand passport.The person cannot live at the same address or be a relation.

, You have to pay fees to complete your application. As of 2016, those fees were about NZ$500 to complete the citizenship by grant application, though they are subject to change. For citizenship by descent, the application fee is about NZ$200. You also must pay a fee if your citizenship is denied., Once your application is completed, you can either send in your application by mail or make an appointment to go to one of the citizenship offices. The locations to walk the application in are in Wellington, Auckland, Christchurch, and Manukau. The addresses are on the online application.If you mail it in, make sure to use a ""track and trace"" courier bag. Mail the application to Department of Internal Affairs, PO Box 10680, Wellington 6143

, You must take either an oath or affirmation to become a citizen by grant. Basically, you'll just stand up at a ceremony and say you pledge loyalty to New Zealand. The oath is religious (it includes ""so help me God"") while the affirmation is not. You also take the oath on a religious book., To have a resident visa, you must fill out the application to gain the visa. You also most have already have been a resident or former resident of New Zealand, which means you must have studied or worked there on a different visa beforehand., To gain permanent residency, you need to have already lived in New Zealand for 2 years under another a resident visa. A resident visa grants you the right to live in New Zealand for a certain amount of time, while permanent resident visa grants you permission to live there indefinitely.For this criteria to be met as a ""commitment"" to New Zealand, you must have actually been in New Zealand for 184 days each year of the past 2 years.Remember that eligibility requirements can be different depending on what country you're coming from, so make sure to check the application for your country.

, Another option to gain a permanent resident visa is to have had tax residence status for at least 41 days in each year for the last two years. That means you must have held a job and been paying taxes to the New Zealand government., Having a business established in New Zealand can also give you eligibility for permanent residency. You must have had this business open for at least a year before applying., Another way to gain a permanent resident visa is to have an investment of NZ$1,000,000 in New Zealand for at least 2 years. You will need to have had the investment for all 24 months; you can't have withdrawn it at any point., You can also establish a base in New Zealand as a way of meeting the commitment part of the permanent residency visa. Basically, that means that you have bought and maintain a house in New Zealand., Once you've met one of the eligibility requirements, you need to fill out the application for a permanent resident visa. It includes things like biographical information, data about your eligibility, a character section (discussing any criminal problems you may have had in the past), and any information on other family members included in the application that will live with you, such as a spouse or child.The application is available online.

Say ""I love you"".",How to Make Valentine's Day Special on a Budget," It's easy to get bogged down in the buying frenzy surrounding Valentine's Day, as retailers vie to rake in some decent profits from romance-inspired lovers. Love isn't about what you give in goods though; it's about what you give by way of time, attention, and acknowledgment of the other person. And none of those can be purchased. Once you view Valentine's Day from the perspective of it being about acknowledging and celebrating your love by spending time together, it's easier to realize that a budget Valentine is still a perfect date opportunity.

, One of the tricks to saving money on Valentine's Day is to still indulge in some of the traditional Valentine's accessories but to reduce them. For example, instead giving her a dozen red roses, give her one, held in your teeth, and accompanied by your best impression of a Spanish dancer. Or, give him a special brand of chocolate bar instead of a whole box of expensive chocolates. In this way, you can still participate in the essence of Valentine's Day but spend very little.

, A homemade card is always more meaningful than a purchased one. It says not only what you write in it but also ""I took the time to make this because I care enough about you to give that time."" As far as mementos go, it's likely the card will be kept for many years to come! Other things can be made too, for gifts. Draw on your own skills when making gifts; for example, if you're a keen gardener, give something from the garden; if you're a keen cook, make something delectable; if you're a keen outdoor enthusiast, give a fully guided nature walk or a lesson in your favorite sport.

, An excellent way to show your love can be through making love coupons or vouchers. These can contain promises that range from the mundane to the downright sexy, all depending on your willingness to do things for your love. Make a large heart from construction paper, attach as many coupons as you're willing to give. Some examples include:


This voucher is good for one week of dish washing by me, no questions asked.
This voucher is good for guaranteeing one season of your favorite TV show to be shared with me. And a promise that there will be no channel surfing during said show.
This voucher is good for one loving foot massage. To be redeemed any time.
This voucher is good for one massage in a bubble bath. Any time of day or night.
This voucher is good for a long snog in front of a movie of your choice.
This voucher is good for the night of your wildest dreams. To be redeemed when you're in the mood.

, You can either initiate this yourself, or suggest it as a Valentine's tradition for the two of you. The item should be very affordable, and recall some experience that the two of you have had together. Make a nice card that explains the gift but don't be too cheesy in what you write. For example:


A cheap plastic snow globe with two hearts inside. Write that it reminds you of the night when she fell in the snow, and that when you came to pick her up, you couldn't help noticing how adorable she looked surrounded by snow.
A plastic surfboard keyring. Write that it reminds you of the month the two of you spent surfing in Bali and how it was there that you realized you wanted to surf the rest of your life with him.
A brooch featuring a computer and mouse. Write that it is a reminder of how the two of you met online and how you'll never forget the beauty of her first smile by video chat.

, Giving time is the ultimate romantic gesture. It will mean a great deal if you're usually stretched for time and you choose to give up the whole day to spend with your beloved, doing things together that have nothing to do with work, raising a family, paying bills, etc. Banish the mundane and just allow the day to be about the two of you together. As part of this, be thoroughly attentive, listen, and take the chance to share dreams and hopes for the future, including renewing dreams that might have been taken for granted over time.


If you can, find babysitters for the kids so that you're truly alone. If not, let the kids know that this is a day for ""mom and dad"" and get them helping in making it special.

, Make a meal in which you go to extra trouble. It doesn't have to be expensive food; just spend time making it more complicated and interesting than the usual daily meals. Look online for recipe ideas to help you turn ordinary ingredients into something fabulous. If you're going to watch a special DVD together, be sure to make some tasty popcorn to share.


Spell ""I love you"" on the plate using food! Use your beloved's favorite food if you can.
Make a love heart pizza or bake a heart shaped loaf or your partner's favourite cake.
Playing board games is another entertaining option for passing the evening in fun rivalry. Or, set up a video or online game that the two of you can get deeply involved in, provided both of you really enjoy such games.

, Put on warm clothes and step out to check out the night sky. If you have to travel, add picnic rugs, a thermos of warm drink, some snack bars, and a full tank of fuel. Find somewhere on the city outskirts where the sky is clear. Take along a star chart and look for stars that you know. Choose a star just for the two of you and make a promise to look for it every Valentine's Day.

, Do the unexpected and thrill your beloved. Secretly learn a few dance moves and surprise her by taking out to dance. Memorize his favorite poem and recite it after dinner, then present him with a rose you've grown yourself. Make it appear as if the two of you are set to have a movie night in, then suddenly gasp: ""Oh my! We mustn't miss ......"" And drag her out the door to see the sun set, watch a movie, listen to a visiting band, or whatever else you think is most appropriate.

, Take your beloved to somewhere they told you was special to them as a child. Spend time walking around it and asking questions about their feelings. Explain that it might not be the same as when your beloved was young but that now your beloved has two memories of the special place – one without you and one with you. Be sure to take a photo of the two of you there!


Another way of remembering the past is to dig out old photos and go through them together. Look at photos from both your childhood times and your times together. It's great to have an excuse to enjoy all those photos that get stowed away and forgotten about!

, It doesn't cost anything but it says and means a great deal. Don't be shy; say it a lot during the day. Tell your love how you really feel. He or she will appreciate your honesty and it will mean more than any gift . could.

Arrange for dinner.,
Plan a day out.,
Take your partner out for coffee.,
Go for a long walk together.,
Surprise your significant other with a weekend away.,
Take your partner out dancing.",How to Make Valentine's Day Extra Special1," You can book a reservation at your favorite restaurant or you can cook. It doesn’t even have to be fine dining. Often just putting something together in advance is a good way to show your Valentine that you care and that you’re thinking of them. Add some candles, turn down the lights, and it's a perfect romantic evening.;
, If you’re like most people, there are probably so many things to do in your area that you’ve just never gotten around to. Spend an entire day exploring with your significant other, and make a point of going places neither of you have ever been before. Go to a new museum, go paintballing together, or hike a long trail that you’ve both been interested in, but never had the time for. You never know--you might even get to see a fun new side of the person you love., It sounds so cliché, until you realize that it has been forever since you last took an hour or two to simply sit down across from them at a table to talk. Put your phones on silent and out of sight, and just give each other your full attention.

, If you go to a nature preserve or big park, bring a field guide to birds or wild flowers and have fun working together to identify what you see. If you’re in the city, do a self-guided walking tour together, wander down adorable side streets you’ve never noticed before, and make lots of stops to smell the roses.

, Book a few nights at a cosy bed and breakfast, or visit a nearby city for a few days. You might have to tell them to set aside the weekend for something special, but they don't have to know where you're going. Go all out, and make it a weekend to remember., Swing dances often include a brief lesson beforehand for beginners and people who want to brush up on rusty skills, and they can be a lot of fun. Or get up close and personal with a tango class. Nothing says romantic like a jazzy number and a beckoning dance floor."

Write your Valentine a note.,
Volunteer with your partner for a cause they care about.,
Tell them how grateful you are.,
Sit down together and tell your partner face-to-face what you love about them.",How to Make Valentine's Day Extra Special2," Tell them how much you love them, and include specific things that you love about them, whether it’s how passionate they are about the things they love or their strong sense of justice or just the way they smile when they’re a little embarrassed.


Usually the first attempt at writing a note is awkward and disjointed and you run out of space before you’ve said what you want to. Don’t stress: jot down a few ideas on a separate sheet of paper or write an entire first draft before you set anything down in your card.

, If they love dogs, offer to spend a day cleaning kennels and walking dogs at the local SPCA. If they lost a loved one to cancer, then assist with a Relay for Life event in your area. By investing time in something near to their heart, you are affirming that what matters to them matters to you., For a day or a week, take a moment every time they do something you appreciate to tell them that you’re grateful for them and what they do.


Especially try to note things you might normally take for granted. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just a simple, ""Thanks for letting me borrow your coat,"" or ""Thank you for cancelling your plans to be with me when I was sick.""
Try to work in appreciation for general qualities, like, ""You're so thoughtful. I appreciate that you always open the door for me when we go out."" Or, ""That was so kind of you to give them a ride home. You're a really good friend.""

, Notes are nice and can be saved for another day, but few things are as thoughtful and affirming as having someone look directly into your eyes to tell you how much they love you and why.


Try to make it about them. Say things like, ""You're such a compassionate person, and it really comes through in your interactions with people. They can tell how warm and kind you are within minutes of meeting you."" It's okay to talk about how they make you feel, since you're telling them why you love them, but try not to make it too self-centered. For example, ""You're such an open person that I've always felt like I could tell you anything,"" is great, because it emphasizes a particular quality they possess and it tells them that you trust them.
If you compliment them on physical features, be specific. Don't just say, ""You're sexy,"" or ""You're beautiful."" Say, ""You have gorgeous eyes,"" or ""You walk so confidently, and it's really attractive.""

Order their favorite takeout just the way they like it.,
Bring your Valentine's pet a new toy or treat.,
Make them a music mix.,
Pamper them.,
Send your partner flowers.",How to Make Valentine's Day Extra Special3," When you know someone well, you learn their quirks: how well they like their burgers cooked, what they’re allergic to, that they can’t stand the texture of artichokes or hearts of palm. When you can actually order for someone, you show your love by actively paying attention to their likes and dislikes and communicating that you want to treat them well.

, For a lot of animal lovers, the best way to show your love for them is to acknowledge their pet. By bringing something for Fido, you let them know that you can see how important he is to them and for that reason, he’s important enough to you to include on your gift list.

, Maybe it’s old school to give cds or mixtapes in the age of internet streaming services, but that just makes it more fun. Make a list of songs that are special to the two of you or that make you think of them. Go the extra mile: take a Sharpie and decorate the cd with fun and quirky art., Schedule a couples’ massage. Relax in a sauna. Spend a day at the spa with your Valentine, and they're sure to come away feeling seriously loved.

, This gesture is classic, but that just makes it a clearer statement. If you know what their favorite flowers are, that’s great, but for many people, the gesture alone says it all.

Fold a piece of paper in half.,
Draw the outline of half of a heart.,
Cut along the penciled outline.,
Unfold the paper.",How to Make a Symmetrical Paper Heart1," It can be a rectangle or square-shaped piece of paper – either will work. For a classic, festive heart, use red, pink, or purple construction paper. If you want a big heart, then use a big paper.





;
, Start sketching from the paper crease, so that both the top and bottom of the heart come from the crease. When you cut out this line from each folded side of the paper, you will ensure that each half of the heart is perfectly symmetrical to the other.








The outline you draw will determine the final heart shape, so now is the time to decide the aesthetic fate of your paper heart.
Use a pencil if you plan to erase the line. Use a pen if you don't mind a dark border to your paper heart.

, Start from the crease—the top or bottom-center of the heart—and cut out the line you drew. Snip carefully, but don't worry too much about precision. Once you unfold your heart, each side will be symmetrical no matter how skewed your cut. Make sure that you are cutting both halves of the fold.








If you don't want the dark line to show on the finished heart: cut just inside the pencil mark, or carefully erase it later., You should have a symmetrical paper heart. You're now ready to give the heart to someone or use it in a larger craft project!

It's time to move on: As a refugee, many questions like: why me?,
Refresh Your Mind:Give yourself some time to think.,
Build new relationships: After moving to your new house in your host country it is a great opportunity to meet your new neighbors.,
Try to find a proper job: Even though it is difficult for a refugee, it is vital to find a job.,
Don't believe everything you hear: There will always be rumors about the refugees that they will be kicked out of Syria.,
Learn the dialect: Remember that you have to learn the dialect very well, but you don't have to use it.,
Keep yourself active: Involve yourself with out-door activities.,
Make yourself feel at home: Don't accept living in a messy house just because you're a refugee.,
Educate yourself: Although you may suffer from poor education in Syria because of the different subjects in the Syrian schools and the high fees of the colleges, but that doesn't mean to lose the hope or the ambition.,
Make your people proud: You should be careful and responsible.,
Volunteer Work: If you have enough free time, try to do some volunteer work.,
Writing Articles: If your host country is a well developed country that knows a little about Iraqi refugees, and you were a good writer, writing articles about Iraqi refugees and Iraq will be a great project.,
Speak out for your people: As the time passes, you may forget that you are Iraqi.,
Be frugal:It is essential you be aware of the way you spend your money.,
Eat to remember: It's certain that you are going to miss the good old Iraqi food.,
Lastly, as a final point: Now, after you got blossomed out and brightened by those points noted above, you are so ready to face whatever thing here in Syria.",How to Be an Iraqi Refugee in Damascus," Why it happened to my family? May come across your mind. Try not to be occupied by this big, useless question mark. Being a refugee is not the end of the world you know, life's great opportunities always exist and are waiting for you to benefit from them. Just put everything behind your back and start moving on with your new life.;
, After the difficult circumstances that you suffered from in Iraq, you might feel depressed. Your situation could worsen if you don't take a short time for relaxation. It is crucial you spend some time out in one of the beautiful places in Syria. You don't need to go to a remote place like Al-Latakia, but you can go to a public garden and spend one to two hours there. That will refresh your mind ,make your body feel renewed and help you think properly on what to do in this period.

, Having a good relationship with people around you is important because you'll definitely need advice especially when you see your host country for the first time; also it allows you to find new friends you can trust. It may not be easy at first, but with a little smile and a kind greeting, you'll gradually win people's respect.

, You might not have that many of opportunities, so you should not be fussy. You might also have a financial resource from Iraq. Think further because this resource will not last forever. Besides, work gives the experience needed in everyday life.

, Do not let such things get you down. Instead, ignore those lies and continue your life. Believing rumors leads to severe depression that makes you do nothing but sleep!!!!I remember that every summer there are people who claim ""That's It, this is the last summer ever for you Iraqi refugees!?"". It's been four years of living here in Syria and nothing of that happened. For those who believed, some left their jobs and even left Syria. However, on the other side, there are some people who have been living in peace and harmony.

, In certain occasions you will need to use it. When you go shopping or in a taxi for e.g., as an Iraqi taking a taxi in Syria, the taxi drivers always bluff and increase the sum of money. Sometimes, to increase the tariff, they even take you on a tour around the city until they get you to the place where you want to go and you don't even recognize it! The best way to avoid bluffing is not to talk to the taxi driver and just try to use the Syrian words you already know so that they don't recognize you're a foreigner. Another reason why it's important to learn exactly the same dialect is to find a suitable job, especially in secretary jobs, you need to speak to customers Syrian not Iraqi.

, You can't live your life mourning the fact that you're a refugee. Being a refugee doesn't prevent you from living your life just like a citizen does. Start over and try to forget the unpleasant memories by having some out-door activities and get a life. Try to find some good out-going friends. Go to places where you can show Syrians how we dance dabka on Majid al-Muhandis or Kadhim songs. Embrace your differences and enjoy them. Play the sport that you like; football, basketball, swimming or any sport you might be interested in. If not interested in sports then try to join a club or a course from which you can learn a lot of new things and develop your skills. If not interested in clubs and taking courses then go out on trips every now and then. Go hiking with the family or any person you feel is somehow related to you. Try to bond that relationship with them and engage in those activities together, going to the sea for example or simply gardens and be in touch with nature. If not interested in out-door activities, you can still have in-door activities. Try in-door sports like yoga and aerobics.

, Because day by day, you'll feel like you've changed to worse. You won't feel comfortable no matter what you do to be happy if your house means mere a shelter to you. Don't say it's just a rented house. Make it your home and make it more comfortable, clean and healthy. Invite some friends to cook dinner or make a little party. You can get little plants that grow inside the house or in the balcony. Because Iraqis are used to live in houses with big gardens, having some plants in the house will make you feel more balanced from the inside. If not interested in in-door activities then think about what we mentioned while taking a shower. You will be inspired with new ideas that you might want to try out. If not interested in the ideas that come to your mind, make your bed comfortable, wear pajamas and try to have some sleep. You're just tired man! Relax, everything will go just fine..

, The education is not only through schools or colleges. It includes any book you read, any documentary you watch or any work you perform. Try to seize any opportunity that comes in your way until you have the chance to be a student in one of the educational institution.

, Remember that names don't define us, saying I'm Iraqi don't reflect who you really are. names don't give us meaning, but it's us who give meanings to names. It's our responsibilities as Iraqis as well as refugees to give that word ""Iraqi"" a great meaning by being great ourselves and reflect honorable reputation of our own country.

, You can do that by joining organizations like the Red Crescent, Red Cross, UNV, etc. This experience will enable you to help other people and gain good experience on your CV. In addition to that, people will like you and you will have more friends. Above all that, there is no better feeling than helping people and drawing smiles on their faces.

, By this, you'll probably make money by writing for magazines or websites. Also, it will develop your writing skills. So why not trying it!

, You may be unable to recall the Iraqi accent, the delicious and unique kinds of food, and the hospitality of our people. Try to follow your home news, listen to patriotic songs, make friends with the Iraqi youths and always remember that Iraq, by which I mean the whole Iraqis, didn't do anything wrong and what happened was its destiny.

, Now You are paying for rent, food, bills….etc, and you haven't got a job yet. So try to be frugal ,and spend your money wisely just on the essential needs of life. There are many ways by which you can cut down the amount of money you spend. For instance, try to live in a neighborhood where you can find cheap rent and inexpensive markets. Besides, you can use public transportation, like the SERVICE or the GREEN BUS instead of taking taxis. In addition, if you are a smoker, this is the best time for you to give up smoking.

, You need to eat some of it even if you are out of your country. You are lucky to be in Syria because there are some places in Syria that became almost full of Iraqi people, shops and restaurants. Places such as Jaramanah, Qudsaya, and Sayda Zianab. So if you want to eat the grilled, greasy, hot and delicious meat (Gass) in the big and freshly-baked Samoon bread, you can do that in Jaramanah. Kassim abo al Gass, is one of the famous Iraqi restaurants that is recommended for its great Gass, and you must have known him back in Al-Adhamia in Baghdad. You can go to Jaramanah and ask anyone about it and they will tell you where to go. Kobbat Hayawi is another famous Iraqi restaurant, famous with its Kobbah balls, made of rice and stuffed with special mix of meat, pepper and a special spices. You can find that in Qudsya. You must have eaten hundreds of Maskof in your life, especially in journeys and family trips. And I know that here there are no special trips like the ones you used to do back in our beloved country. However, you must miss the big, flame-grilled and lovely fish (Maskov) as much as you miss Iraqi trips. So don't worry, your nostalgia has ended, you can go to Sayda Zainab and finally order that great meal.

, Hopefully, you won’t face any difficulties. My last suggestion for you, don’t ever give up hope and feel depressed, you are required to struggle for your goal and cause. As noted before, refugees should reflect the best image of their homeland. Accordingly, you must be always energetic, active and hard-working in order to feel satisfied and fulfill with your brand new community.

",How to Make a Crochet and Paper Valentine Card," It doesn't have to be microscopic, just slender enough to look elegant. Use a hook size that is comfortable for your yarn or string.
,, Chain one as a turning chain (first row)., Don't forget the turning chain between rows. You should now have a small square of crochet, five stitches wide by five rows high., Repeat this chain one and double crochet five more times, for a total of six sets of (ch1, dc) into the same center stitch. This leaves you with a semicircular shape. Slip stitch into the corner of the original square., Work into the center of the next side of the square. Since you are now working into the side of your work, there won't be a specific stitch. Just pick a spot in the middle and work into it.,, Pull gently on the edges until it's fairly flat and even., One easy border is a picot stitch.







Work this stitch by doing a single crochet (sc).






Chain three.






Single crochet again back into the same spot. Slip stitch or single crochet around the edge to the next place where you want a picot.






 Picots.

Work the picots in locations so that they complement the heart shape and so that they are in about the same place on both sides.

,, You can fold a piece of scrap paper in half (this is the side of a junk mail envelope) to create a pattern. Size them to your crocheted heart., It will help if this heart is out of fairly stiff paper or cardstock.,, Use a push pin to poke holes where you will sew the heart to the paper. If you locate them evenly, it can help to flatten the piece and make it symmetrical., Use the same thread as you used to make the heart so the stitches are concealed.





 Leave an open space in the center.

Leave an open space in the center on the back, to give yourself a place for the glue.
Stitching at the tips of the picots will help the heart lie flat.

, Mark the locations of the points, top and bottom, lightly in pencil., You can letter on the front or the inside, or both.

If calligraphy is not your strong point, you could also use a computer printer or stamps to letter the card. Or, leave the front blank and write in your own handwriting inside.




 A fountain pen.

This is a great opportunity to use a calligraphy pen, fancy fountain pen, dip pen, brush, or other artistic tool.




 Practice on scratch paper.

Practice the lettering on a piece of scratch paper if you need to. Get the size and spacing about right for the card. It's especially important to practice if you're writing with anything you don't often use.
Draw guidelines lightly in pencil for the letters. You can even trace the letters lightly in pencil to help you get the spacing right.
Write the letters. This is a handmade card, so don't be afraid to go for a handmade look.

Wait for the ink or paint to dry thoroughly, then erase the guidelines. Repeat for the lettering on the inside.

, Align it carefully on the card and smooth it down., Score it and fold it in half.,,,

The tab makes it pop up a bit. If you'd rather it didn't, glue the two sides of the tab together or use a single thickness of cardboard for the tab. The tab helps compensate for the thickness of the string you used to sew on the heart.

Cook for him.,
Make a mixtape (or playlist).,
Write him a poem or a love letter.,
Buy him a cologne that you like.,
Put together a gift basket.",How to Get the Perfect Valentine's Gift for Your Boyfriend1," Take advantage of that old saying: ""The way to a man's heart is through his stomach."" Whether it's a simple dessert or a full-fledged meal, presenting your boyfriend with food is a tangible demonstration that you care. Here are some timeless options:



Make him cookies. Don't know his favorite kind of cookie? Now's the time to find out! Or, if you want it to be a surprise, go with classic crowd-pleasers like chocolate chip or sugar cookies.






Whip up a decadent chocolate dessert. Try brownies, chocolate-covered strawberries, or an ambitious chocolate souffle.






Set up a romantic meal. If you want to go all-out on food, make your guy a beautiful Valentine's Day dinner. If he eats meat, focus on carnivore-pleasing items like bacon or steak. Try these:






Pan-seared steak
Crispy roasted potatoes
Bacon-wrapped asparagus
Chicken cordon bleu
Chicken-fried steak
Baked crab rangoon

;
, Putting together a mixtape of songs that are significant to your relationship can be a really meaningful, personalized present, and you don't have to spend a ton of money to do it. Burn your creation onto a CD for a tangible gift, or send him a digital playlist if you both subscribe to online music services.


Be sure to include ""your"" song, if you have one. If you don't, throw a handful of potential candidates into the mix.
Pay attention to subtext. You might really like the sound of a brooding break-up song, but putting it on your playlist might send your boyfriend the wrong message.
Keep it limited. Stick to around 10 songs, give or take a few. That way he can listen to the whole list in one sitting, and remember that they're meaningful later.

, Sure, you might tell him you love him, but it's nice to have a physical object outlining how you feel, that he can revisit and read whenever he wants. This is the perfect gift if you're on a budget, because it's the thought — and not the cost — that counts. For extra sentiment, write it out in your own handwriting, and pick a nice sheet of paper.



Write him a poem. If you enjoy writing and reading poetry, put your talents to use on an individualized poem.

Or, write out your feelings in prose. If meter and rhyme aren't your forte, that's all right — a prose letter can be just as meaningful!
Borrow someone else's words. If you're struggling to write how you feel, rely on the experts for help. Find a famous piece of poetry, and copy it out in your own handwriting, or print it out and frame it in a pretty way. Some classics to get you started:

""somewhere i have never traveled,"" e.e. cummings
Sonnet XVII, Pablo Neruda
""How Do I Love Thee? Let Me Count the Ways,"" Elizabeth Barret Browning
Shakespeare's 18th Sonnet
""To a Stranger,"" Walt Whitman
""Love's Philosophy,"" Percy Bysshe Shelley
""To Earthward,"" Robert Frost
You could also borrow the lyrics of your favorite love song, if you have one. Songs are basically poetry set to music!



, Cologne is a classic Valentine's Day present because, in theory, it's a benefit to both of you — he'll like smelling awesome, and you'll like whatever scent you choose for him.


Keep in mind that scents don't wear the same on everyone. Everyone's body chemistry is slightly different, so a cologne that smells amazing on one guy might not work for another.
Pay attention to what he already likes. Odds are, your boyfriend wears something that he thinks works for him, so try to stay close to that. If he tends to wear woody, musky colognes, that's probably a good choice for a gift. On the other hand, if he seems to prefer light, citrusy, clean scents, try to find a gift that's in the same category.

, If you don't want to over-commit to one gift, assemble a collection of little presents. Pick a cute container, like an embellished basket or box, and dress it up with ribbons, tissue paper, cellophane, or whatever else you have on-hand to make it special. Consider filling it with these items:


His favorite treat, whether it's candy, cookies, or a particular store-bought food.
A pretty beverage. If you're old enough to drink, consider buying his favorite beer or a nice bottle of wine.






Stocking stuffer items: Rely on little items you might use for Christmas stocking stuffers, such as new headphones, new supplies for whatever sport he plays (like golf balls or tennis balls), or a few items he can use for his hobbies (like grilling tools or colored pencils).

Buy books for your bookworm boyfriend.,
Buy music-themed gifts if he's an audiophile.,
Support his gaming hobby.",How to Get the Perfect Valentine's Gift for Your Boyfriend2," If you're dating a reader, hook him up with some new material. Do a little detective work about what he's currently reading and what he already has, and try to fill in the blanks with a similar book.


Take advantage of product recommendations. For instance, if you know your boyfriend loved a certain book, ask the clerk at your local bookstore for similar titles. Or, type the title into a service like Amazon and see what other readers bought after reading that one.
If you're not sure what to buy, get a gift card. Books are a pretty personal gift, and it can be tough to figure out what someone would enjoy reading. If you're stumped, rely on a gift card. Offer to go shopping with him and make a date of it.

, If your boyfriend is really into music, get him a present that's in line with his interests. Here are a few suggestions:


Pick up some new guitar picks if he's a guitarist, or drumsticks if he's a drummer.
Find a good pair of noise-canceling headphones if he listens to a lot of music.
Get him an iTunes gift card or a Spotify subscription.

, If your boyfriend is a big gamer, he's almost guaranteed to like a gaming-themed gift for Valentine's Day.


Buy him a new game. See if there are any upcoming releases he's had his eye on, or ask his buddies what he's been dying to play.
Or, just buy him credits. You can buy the gaming equivalent of a gift card depending on what platform he uses:

Steam (PC)
Xbox Live Marketplace (Xbox)
PlayStation Store (PS3)


Update his controller. Whether he uses a console controller or a mouse, buying him a new piece of hardware could be a great Valentine's gift.

Ask questions about the mode of delivery.,
Sum up the nature of the card.,
Analyse the message.,
Probe the suspects.",How to Find Out Who Is Sending You Valentine's Cards," How did you receive the Valentine's card? There are vital clues in the mode of delivery if you look closely:


If it was hand delivered to your home, consider who you know who lives locally, or who could possibly drop by on their way to work or studies.
If the Valentine's card was sent by mail to your house list, consider who has access to your home address. If your name and address are publicly available, this clue won't be so useful though.
Ask other members of the household if they saw anything or talked to anyone when the card arrived.
Have a look at the postmark on the front of the envelope. This may give you a clue to the area your admirer is from. Be careful though, the sender may have been very clever about finding a post office well away from their usual haunts.
If the Valentine's card was left for you to find at work, it almost definitely would be from one of your colleagues. And chances are they would be keeping their eye on you to make sure you received it. This will narrow the field considerably.;
, What type of Valentine's card is it? Romantic, humorous, cute, tacky, minimal or elaborate? In most cases, it's probable that your secret admirer would have unwittingly selected a card that reflects their own personality. For example, the hot photographer from the café would have very different tastes from your pub mate. From your list of suspects, who do you think best suits the card?

, What exactly has the sender written on the card? Your admirer will want you to find out who they are, so will have hopefully left a clue:


Think back to conversations you have had with people who might be the sender - does anything click between things already said to your face and what is written in the card?
Is the handwriting familiar to you? Don't put too much thought into this one though, as they may well have tried to disguised it, or typed it.

, By now you must have reduced your list down to a few key players. Find a time when you're alone with each of them and casually bring up the subject of Valentine's Day. Mention that you received an anonymous card and watch their reaction. If they look nonplussed, chances are that it wasn't from them. If they blush, grin uncontrollably, or show a lot of interest - you're probably on the right track.


Ask if they sent any cards this Valentine's Day. If they say ""No"", drop the subject and move on. If they say they did, ask to whom. This is perfect because if they tell you that it was to someone else, you can feign interest as they tell you all about her without losing face, but if it was to you, they will be obliged to come clean.






Choose the next move. It's now down to you to decide whether you want to take things further with your secret admirer or not.

Acquire the supplies needed.,
Prepare the frame from the edges of CD cases.,
Measure and mark 102mm from the inside of the bottom of the edge piece.,
Make a stand from wire.,
Bend the backing to cover as much area across the back of the template as possible.,
Bend the base to support the weight of the entire collage, glass, photo, and the wire itself.,
Create the board from the template you printed earlier.,
Trace around the backing-support section of the stand onto the back of one of the templates.,
Slowly carve into the card using the scalpel or sharp scissors to make a recess the size and shape of the backing-support.,
Place the template face up on the other piece of card ensuring that it is aligned properly.,
Slowly carve into the card as you did for the backing support.,
Create the collage on the piece of card.,
Create the message for the board.,
Attach the frame in the grooves.,
Fill the grooves with glue, then firmly press in the edge pieces.,
Wrap the stand in ribbon.",How to Make a Valentine's Photo Frame Collage," These are listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" section below.


Print out the template available in the ""Sources and Citations"" section below. This will be the photo frame, message board and decoration piece.;
, Take the cover off the CD case so that you are left with only the thin, coloured base.


Measure and mark a line along both left and right edges of base of the CD case. You want the distance from the inside edge of the ridge to the cut to be no less than roughly twice the thickness of the glass.
Cut along the line, being sure not to shatter the plastic, or crack it.
Smooth down the bumps and rough edges with a file or sand-paper.
Repeat for the other side of the case.
Shorten the edge pieces.


, Then cut off the top. The bottom should still have the lip which will finally support the glass, completing the photo frame.


Note: Be careful that you don't end up with two for the same side!

, Cut 90–100 centimeter (35.4–39.4 in) of strong, straight wire (an old coat hanger is ideal).


Make a bend in the middle so the angle between the metal is roughly 90°, forming an 'L' shape.
Make the base and backing support, dividing the wire in two.

, You will soon have to carve this shape out of the backing, so don't make it too complex.

, The collage will naturally be heavier on the left-hand side due to the glass, which means if you bend the base to be in a clockwise shape, it will increase the stiffness and stability of the entire system.


Ensure the wire still makes an 'L' shape viewed side-on. Namely, the base is perpendicular to the backing support.
Make sure both halves are nice and flat. This is a little fiddly, and hard with thicker wire, possibly requiring pliers. Take your time with this step, especially for the backing, as it will make later steps much easier.
Bend back the backing structure so that there is about a 75° angle between horizontal and the backing.

, Outline the template onto the board. Note, that if the board you have (like the one in the photo) has a different finish on both sides, then you need to do an outline of the template the right way up, and also upside down as opposed to two the right way up. This will allow you to keep the 'nice' side facing out both front and back.


Cut out the board using a sharp pair of scissors. Kitchen shears are much better for thicker card. You should now have two heart-shaped pieces of board with nothing on them.
Cut grooves into the board for the stand backing-support, and the photo frame edges.

, It may be beneficial to keep the wire in place with some blue-tack. If you have a particular side you want facing out, use this side with the larger half of the heart to the right. That is, with the side the photo frame will be on facing away. It is important to get this right, otherwise you may have to cut out the card again.

, You will have to do this a number of times, peeling layers away from the cut as you go. If your card is not as thick as the wire used for the stand, cut the entire way through, leaving a hole.

, Place the glass for the frame over the outline, then using a blunt pencil, or nib of a ball-point pen, firmly mark down the left and right hand edges of the glass. This should leave an indent in the card under the template. You no longer need the template after this step.


Mark the edge pieces on the card carefully so that the shape is clear enough to carve out.

, This time, follow the markings very carefully. The edge pieces need to fit comfortably into the grooves you create. Carve no deeper than the thickness of the glass (which is why the edge pieces were made to be twice the thickness). As you go along, test that the edge piece fits snugly into the groove you are creating.


Glue together the two pieces of card with craft glue. Ensure that they are properly aligned and that you have carved out the correct sides. Leave to dry with pressure keeping the pieces together. A couple of phone books does nicely.
Attach the stand to the card by placing the backing support into the groove carved out for it. It should fit nicely and (close to) flush with the card. Don't worry if it doesn't sit flush, it will still hold, but it must be at least halfway into the card.
Add glue along the inside of the groove, then firmly push the backing-support into place. You may get an excess of glue, wipe this off with some tissues.
Let dry with pressure on top. This is tricky, as the glue will often seep out the sides of the groove and stick to whatever is applying the pressure. It is best to choose an item of wood, or plastic to place between the card and the weight. Every 5 minutes or so for the first half an hour, move the weight and the plastic/wood to ensure it hasn't stuck to the card or stand.
You should now have a free-standing heart-shaped card with grooves carved into the front.

, You can be creative here, doing whatever takes your fancy. The easiest is to cover the card in photos of you and your loved one. Be sure not to go over the area the photo frame (left) or the message board (right) occupy, else you won't be able to put either in.

, This should be a thoughtful, hand-written message on high-quality paper.


Glue the message onto the right-side of the card within the box as marked on the template.

, Use the glass of the frame to ensure that the edges are correctly aligned. You may need to carve out more to get them aligned exactly.


Clear the grooves of any excess collage materials (overlapping photos, etc) with the scalpel/sharp scissors.

, Be sure that you have them on the correct sides as in the diagram. Allowing these to dry can be tricky. You need to keep them straight and not allow them to ease their way out of the grooves. Sitting, holding each with a thumb and fore-finger is the best approach, as it will hold them steady without so much force as to skew their position.

, Take your time to cover the entire base and stem of the stand with ribbon so you can not see any wire from the front. Use a small dab of craft glue on each end to stick the ribbon down to itself. The Valentine's photo frame collage is now ready to give as a gift.

Get some perspective.,
Love your singleness.,
Be happy within yourself regardless of your relationship status.,
Avoid being swept away by the tide.,
Treat yourself.,
Find out what's happening in the singles scene.,
Think of the money you're saving.,
Love your exercise.,
Consider the day after Valentine's Day.",How to Be Happy Being Single on Valentine's Day," If you feel sad because Valentine's Day causes feelings of loneliness and reminds you that you're ""just"" a single, it might help to realize that there are plenty of other single people experiencing Valentine's Day too.


While some of them might be feeling as miserable as you, some of them are probably having a wonderful time snickering at the pointlessness of Valentine's Day or not even bothering to give it any notice. And then there are many couples who resist Valentine's Day as much as possible, despairing of the pressure to conform to purchasing gifts and celebrating the occasion like clockwork and who find the commercialization of Valentine's Day crass even though they're in love.
With this perspective in mind, it can be a little easier to stop sniffling into your handkerchief.
Remind yourself that the benefits of Valentine's day are realized in the cashier's till of the florist, candy retailers, gift stores and restaurants catering for romantic dinners for two.

, Think about all the marvelous benefits of being single, from not fighting over the TV remote control to being able to keep your living space as clean or as messy as you'd like. The ""couples"" messaging is strong but it isn't a reflection of the full reality of how people choose to live their lives; don't fall for the hype that everyone's paired off and happy as a result. There are many very happy single people but it's just not currently fashionable to cover the happiness of being single in media or political discourse.


Write a list of all the good points about being single. For example, free time, no compromises on the home front, less responsibilities, etc. And think about how some of those good points would evaporate within a relationship. Focus on the benefits rather than seeing drawbacks.
If people choose to rub your ""singleness"" in your face on Valentine's Day, be strong and reply with compassion: ""I like being single. I get to choose how I want to live without having to make compromises, meals, or even the bed."" And you might wish to mention that statistics reveal that half the community is single, with 51 percent of women, for example, living without a spouse., Romantic tales often suggest that another person can complete you, with common sayings such as ""my better half"", ""I was half the person without you"", and ""our two hearts beat as one"" being readily asserted with few people stopping to assess what that actually means. If taken too seriously, this unhealthy perspective can mean co-dependence, loss of independence, and losing yourself in another person. That is hardly romantic! And do relationships equate with happiness ever after? Divorce statistics and the stories of unhappy marriages seem to attest otherwise for a large group of people. Bear in mind that there's no need to change who you are, or to lose your liberty or your habits when you're single. Rather than feeling down on Valentine's Day, celebrate the strengths and achievements that testify to you being a whole and healthy person, a person who has space for love should it come along but who does not need such a relationship to create self-worth and happiness confidence.

, You may be very romantic and long for your ""soul mate"" some day but patience may need to be your current virtue. There are plenty of Valentine's Days in a lifetime just as there are plenty of possible people with whom you could eventually fall in love. Sometimes what is difficult about surviving Valentine's Day as a single is the sheer preponderance of love messaging suggesting that you need to hurry or you'll risk missing the boat. If that were the case, then love in your senior years wouldn't be possible and that's just not true. Many romances spark throughout people's lives, no matter what age. In the meantime, love the life you're living and don't live for love.


Remember what can happen to those who rush love and marry before knowing themselves. This can end in one partner realizing some day that they need to ""find themselves"" and the relationship suffers for it.
Diapers are not romantic. Endless nights without sleep are not romantic. Don't rush before you're absolutely ready to commit; enjoy this single time, now or for as long as you intend it to last.

, As you're standing in the queue waiting to pay for your mundane everyday items, if you find yourself falling for the doe-eyed stuffed teddy holding a heart while wishing someone would send you one of those soppy cards, or you're salivating over the box of heart-shaped chocolates, consider treating yourself instead of beating yourself up. If that teddy is so cute you want it on your bed, give in. Or better yet, splurge on buying something you'd really like to have, like a bottle of perfume, a six-pack of European beers, a new coffee plunger, or a recent book by a favorite author. Don't make this day about hurt and loss. Make it all about love, even when single!


Do something decadent like attend a day spa all day long or go for a sightseeing flight over your city. Take along some friends if doing this alone feels weird.
Not too decadent. Set your troubles aside for a day, but don't make them worse. You'll enjoy yourself more now as well as in the future if you know you won't worry more about how to reduce expenses because you spent too much on an indulgence like a huge box of boutique chocolates, or how to lose weight fast because they were too good to stop eating.

, A number of bars hold singles parties that will give you the chance to celebrate the day as an unattached person. Don't take your love expectations though; just go to have a great time and to discover some new people to talk to and share cocktails with. This isn't about falling for anyone out of loneliness!

, The overly romantic person might reply ""Ah but what price can be placed on love? It is priceless!"" That kind of thinking can lead you to live a life of extravagance without focusing on the practicalities and the importance of validating relationships with words and deeds over expensive love tokens. Diamonds are expensive and they're not that good at relationship advice.

, If love has you in its grip, shake it off like you'd shake off the blues, with some good old-fashioned exercise. A run around the park, a skate across the rink, or a swim in the pool might be just the ticket to help you resist the more primal desires.

, Will all those lovers continue whispering sweet nothings in each other's ears, will they keep surprising one another with candlelit dinners and trips down memory lane? It is to be hoped so. Reality however, suggests otherwise and we all, single or unattached, can fall into a habit of not acknowledging the people who matter in our life. Why not use Valentine's Day as a reminder to spend the rest of the year letting people know how much they mean to you. That will show your coupled friends that love is everywhere.

Consider your motivations.,
Think about why you want to end the relationship.,
Reflect on your feelings.,
Write down your main points.,
Rehearse what you want to say.",How to Break up With Someone on Valentine's Day1," No matter how you spin it, you are going to look like the bad guy if you break up with someone on Valentine's Day. Think about why, of all days, you want to break up on Valentine's Day, knowing that this will likely cause the breakup to be extra painful and may even ruin the holiday for your significant other in the future. Is this the precise reason why you want to break up on Valentine's Day — because it will cause your partner the most pain? Or have you realized, through your preparations for the holiday, that you don't really feel the way you would want to feel about your partner on such a romantic day? Before moving forward, really think about why you want to break up on Valentine's Day and what the consequences might be.

Try to look through any anger or disappointment and think deeply about your motives. Maybe breaking up with your partner on Valentine's will be very hurtful — but is this a move you will regret after some time has passed? Is this action really authentic to your character?
Though it's best not to linger in a relationship when you know things aren't going to work out, you may want to break with the person a week or two after the holiday. Or, even better, break up with her before Valentine's Day, so he/she can return presents or cancel any plans he/she may have made for the two of you.
If you decide to go ahead with your plan, just know that you are not going to come off looking great by breaking up with someone on Valentine's Day, so be prepared for some backlash.;
,

Sometimes relationships just fizzle out. Other times one person cheats or is dishonest. In some cases, people simply aren’t compatible. Considering your reasons for breaking up can help you determine what to say.Some people initiate a Valentine's Day breakup because things didn't turn out perfectly from the moment the day started.Don’t end a good relationship because of one day.
Although it may seem like you have a list of reasons, try to look for a common theme between them.
For example, if your significant other is pessimistic, makes fun of people, and depresses you, you can say that he is not positive enough for you.

,

Even though you are the one initiating the break up, you might not feel good about it. Reflecting on your feelings will make it easier for you to accept the break up. It will also make it easier for you to explain to your soon-to-be ex. Understanding how you feel about the break up may help give both you and your ex closure.

Be honest with yourself. Don’t make up reasons why you want to break up to make yourself feel better about it.
Studies have shown that this is a common day for breakups.But, figuring out why you are choosing Valentine’s Day to break up with your partner will help you determine the best time, place, and way to do it.

,

Since it is Valentine’s Day, you want to choose your words carefully, and in advance if possible. Having your main points prepared now may make it less awkward and strained moving forward.Think about how you will phrase your reasons. For example, “I don’t feel we’re compatible, so I’m breaking up with you.”
Plan to avoid phrases like “You always…” or “You never…” because they can make people defensive.
Prepare to talk briefly about the future. Take a few minutes to talk about how you are going to handle the rest of Valentine’s Day, letting friends and family know, and interacting with one another in the future.

,

Practicing will help you become more comfortable with breaking up on Valentine’s Day. It will give you the chance to practice what you want to say and how you want to say it.

Stand in front of the mirror and practice your delivery. Pay attention to your facial expressions; cultivate a caring, concerned expression, but also one that is focused, serious and firm.
Try role-playing with a friend so that you can think about responses to what your soon-to-be ex might say in objection.
Practice your delivery several times until you are comfortable with what you want to say and how and feel you are ready.

Choose the right time.,
Select an appropriate location.,
Be honest.,
Be respectful.,
Maintain your resolve.",How to Break up With Someone on Valentine's Day2,"

Consider that at what time on Valentine’s Day you break up with your partner may have a big impact on how your break up goes. Weigh the pros and cons of breaking up as early as possible in the day, versus waiting to the middle or even end of the day.

Doing it early in the day may be the gentlest time on Valentine’s Day to break up. Going through the motions of caring for someone during Valentine’s Day can end up doing more damage than breaking up.Also, this way your new ex will hopefully still have time to cancel any plans she may have made for the day.
Consider the end of the day. Breaking up with someone on Valentine’s Day morning might leave her (and you) miserable for the entire day. It also gives her the whole day to try to talk to you about it or out of it. This is an option, though remember that you should not go through the motions of being into the relationship all day and then suddenly give her the news at the end of the day. This may be a good option if you are both working all day and don't have an opportunity to talk or see each other until the evening.
Rather than choosing Valentine’s day or night, think about both of your schedules to determine the best time of the day to break up. Considering what you both have on the agenda for the day will guide you in picking the best time of day to do it.

,

Unless you have absolutely no other choice, you should generally avoid breaking up via chat, text, email. It is impersonal and even a bit rude and disrespectful — especially if you have been together for some time. This is even more so the case on Valentine’s Day because of the romantic and sensitive nature of the day.Avoid romantic locations. You should also try to find somewhere that doesn’t hold any special meaning for the two of you.
Pick somewhere with privacy. Unless you have no other choice or you are trying to hurt or embarrass your partner, breaking up without an audience, especially on Valentine’s Day, is the best option.Places that may work include a community park, library, or any other public area that isn’t full of happy couples and big red hearts splashed throughout the landscape.

, You want your soon-to-be ex to understand why you are breaking up on Valentine’s Day and also know that you mean business. Being honest with him about why you are ending it will hopefully help him accept the facts better and you won’t have extra explaining to do later.Although it may hurt him to have you say that you are leaving him for someone else, it’s better they find out from you than some other way.
For example, you could say, “It’s hard to me to admit this, but we’ve always been honest with each other. I’m breaking up with you because, over time, my feelings have changed.”

, Saying things you know will hurt the other person or causing a scene is not the best way to break up with someone, especially on Valentine's Day. Don’t be mean or take shots at the other person’s character or personality, but be sure the person understands that you are breaking up with her and why.For example, saying something like, “I’m leaving you because you are lazy, ignorant, and annoying” is mean and hurtful.
Instead, you might try saying, “I’m not happy in this relationship anymore, so I’m ending it. I don’t think we are compatible and don’t see a future for us.”

, During the break-up don’t allow the other person’s reaction sway your resolve. If you need to, recall why you wanted to break up with the other person and why you needed to do it on Valentine’s Day (and couldn't wait until another day). Be strong. Even though Valentine’s Day is not the best day to end a relationship, remember that breaking up will ultimately be what’s best for both of you and that in all likelihood, you're not the only couple breaking ties this holiday.

Be concise.,
Actively listen.,
Use appropriate body language.,
Speak clearly and confidently.",How to Break up With Someone on Valentine's Day3,"

You may have the urge to keep explaining yourself or start rambling, but keep your break up speech under five minutes.Dragging it out and talking it over repeatedly can become a long, more painful process and ruin the whole Valentine’s Day for both of you.

If the other person suspects that you plan to break up, the shorter the speech the better.
You could simply say, “We’ve both known this was coming, so I’m ending the relationship because neither one of us is happy.”
If this will come as a total surprise, you may want to build in some time where you can allow the other person to digest and ask questions. You should be prepared for him to ask why you have chosen to do this on Valentine's Day.
The length of this discussion with vary for each couple, and it's okay if it takes a while. But if you begin repeating arguments or talking in circles, then it's time to end the conversation. Gauge what you and your partner need in terms of explanations or expressing yourselves, and if it seems you both understand each other and the breakup, then that is the cue to end the conversation.

, Don’t just talk during the break up, listen to what your partner has to say as well.Instead of thinking of a response to what she is saying, just listen and hear what she is trying to tell you. Although you don’t have to change your mind, you should give her a chance to express her feelings about the breakup.

Look at her when she is talking to you to show that you are listening.
Once your ex starts repeating herself or trying to convince you to stay, it’s okay to end the conversation.

, You don’t want to accidentally send your soon-to-be ex mixed signals, so make sure your body language matches your words.For example, excessive hugging and touching may make it seem like you don’t really want to break up.


This doesn’t mean you can’t touch her at all, just make sure you aren’t getting too physical.
Look her in the eyes and sit up straight to show her you are serious.

, This eliminates any confusion about what you are saying. It also shows that you mean it. Keep your voice calm and controlled while you explain why are breaking up on Valentine’s Day.


You might use phrases like: “I’m breaking up with you,” “I’m ending the relationship,” “I’m leaving you.”
Phrases like, “We need some time apart,” or, “I want to take a break,” suggest that you might get back together at some time.

Rejoice in the fact that your child is learning a bit about computers (needed in this day and age) and you are spending some quality time with them.

",How to Use Tux Paint with Your Kids," There are some extras called 'Stamps' that you can get while you are there. The program is 9.3 megs and the 'Stamps' are 27 megs. For a dial-up, this is a substantial time commitment. You can start it at night so that you can download it while you are sleeping.


There is an *.exe file that you can download and a *.zip file. Choose whichever you prefer.
While the software is free, the website is set up for donations, if you are so inclined.;
, You will want to decide how and where to save them (the program saves the files as *.png), among many other things.

, The icons in this program are intentionally large to make it easier for children to use.

, The 17 colors on the bottom are for you and/or your child to choose from. If the color you desire is not showing, you can click on the 18th color (surrounded by a spectrum of colors) and choose a color from there.

, On the right side of the desktop, you will see a pink bar with an arrow in it. There are more tool options to be found when you see that.


Paint

Make sure that you have the color that you want and then pick out the brush that you want. Then start coloring in the open area with whatever you have chosen.


Stamp

The stamps that are contained in the add-in are extensive and very high quality. Basically, with stamps, you are painting with pictures, and this alone can keep a child very amused!
There are quite a few stamps that come with the stamp add-in. However, this program gives you the opportunity to make your own stamps out of photographs that you might have.There is a 'function' on the lower right of the desktop, above the colors that looks like a volume display. That will increase and decrease the size of your stamps.
With some of the stamps, the program will say the name of the stamp.


Lines

The lines work by clicking on one end and then clicking again where you want it to end. As per most of the tools, you can change colors at any point.


Shapes

There are eight shapes to choose from and two forms of each. The outline of the shape and a filled in version.


Text

Click wherever you want the text. By clicking on the pink bar, you can see smaller and smaller size and types of fonts. Try experimenting with them.


Magic

This is one of the functions that provide some fun. There are many functions on this tool, a total of 29. Things like rainbow, light, grass, and the most fun of all, the kaleidoscope. You may find yourself kicking the child out of the computer chair!
Another really fun 'thing' that you can do with Tux Paint's Magic is 'grow flowers'!

Persevere.",How to Encourage Your Children to Reduce Screen Time," You will not be successful in cutting down your child's video game time if you are up late at night playing video poker and browsing Facebook. Children are very smart about ""do as I say, not as I do."" Ask yourself the following questions:


How much time do you spend on computers and television?
What are you doing during this time?
Is what you are doing worthy? For instance, hours of playing World of Warcraft probably is not as beneficial to your life as using the computer to come up with ideas for your daughter's Girl Scout camping trip and coordinate the parents.
How much do you really enjoy what you do and watch? There is nothing wrong with using media in moderation, but sometimes it becomes a habit more than a real joy. For example, do you watch a few shows that you really enjoy, or a lot of mediocre television?
What would you do with the extra time? Excessive use of media ties up a lot of your time, which could be spent in a more balanced way. Would you get outside and exercise more, maybe join a softball league, read a good book, spend time with your stepchildren, or even just get to bed on time?;
, Work together as a family to come up with a plan to use media thoughtfully, with limits.What works for your family may not for another. Every family is different, but several guidelines that could work are:


No TV or game use after dinner: Computer use after dinner is limited to homework.
No more than one hour of computer games.
Television time is limited to one hour a day.
Television and computer games are limited to age and philosophically appropriate choices, subject to parent approval. For instance, pbskids.org offers free, educational video games that are also a lot of fun with no advertisements.
There may be exceptions to the rule, such as ""Family Movie Night"", or if there is a real need to watch the news, such as a weather or news emergency.
Screen time is linked to chores and/or homework: if these are not completed, the screen does not go on.
No television or computer games before school. Media tends to distract people from getting ready for the day, or make it difficult to get to the bus stop on time. There may be an exception for checking the weather on-line or e-mail to check for weather closings.

, Cutting back on screen time frees up time to do other activities. However, many children (at least at first) will find it a little difficult to find new activities to do. As a parent, you can help them re-discover play and recreation with the absence of technology. Try these activities, for example:


Outside play or exercise. Whether some jump-rope or an evening stroll, get some fresh air.
Projects. If you enjoy model-building, why not see if your daughter would like to try. Or use Legos.
Coloring. Coloring is a soothing activity, requiring few materials. Adults have advanced coloring books and pages to try, too!
Play with pets. Pets require a lot of attention, and whether it is playing with the cat, teaching the dog to fetch, or spend some quality time with your hedgehog, it is good for both humans and pets.
Organized activities. With your time away from the game console, you may find you could join Chess Club at the library, or take a martial arts class, join 4-H, or take part in the teen fellowship group at your church.

, When families have been using media too much, it becomes a habit to just use it and stay inside. A smart way to curb these media cravings is to spend more time outside--without using your phone, of course!


Public parks offer the opportunity and space for families to burn energy, engage in cardiovascular activity and socialize. Bring your flying disk, swimsuit, bikes, basketball, dog, and so on!
If you have a recreational center, or are the member of a gym, check for times to get involved with activities. For instance, open swim times at the pool, ice rink, or climbing wall.
In poor weather, try the library. Most libraries offer scheduled activities for children from infants to teenagers. Just realize most libraries have computers, so have a strategy to avoid spending time on the computers there.
Try a walk.  Even a short walk offers health benefits and allows you to socialize with your child.
Camp out. A camp out, even in the backyard can get everyone together without the TV or gadgets.

, Cutting down on media can be challenging especially considering that media is difficult, and there will be slip-ups. But celebrate meeting goals and make the process more about having real authentic fun and spending time together.


As much as possible, be consistent. Write them down. If one parent is OK with watching cartoons in the morning before day care, and the other one is not, you will likely have kids that are not sure exactly what the rules are.
Your children will probably whine and complain, but do not overreact to their complaining. No child likes for video game time to be limited. To be fair, this is something that they did not ask for and you are making the rules. So be patient and understanding about the process. Snapping at them will not get you anywhere.
Have a chart to keep everyone (including parents) accountable. Tracking your progress and achievements will make the process more likely to succeed.
Have a goal, and celebrate it. Have you gone a week staying in your ""Facebook Time""? Celebrate with making pizza, going to the carnival, or other fun.

Talk to your parents or the administrator of the account about adjusting the controls.,
Ask for access to the administrator account.,
Agree to certain monitoring rules around the account.,
Keep in mind no filtering or blocking program is 100 percent effective.",How to Turn off Parental Controls8," This is perhaps the easiest and safest way to adjust the parental controls, as the person who imposed the parental controls has your best interests at heart and may be more willing to adjust them if you discuss the reasons why you think the controls should be lifted.


Start by asking your parents or the administrator why they have imposed Parental Controls on your account. Are you using social media like Facebook too much or playing certain inappropriate games too often? Are you neglecting your health, social circle or studies as the result of too much time online?
After understanding main reasons for the parental controls, try to initiate a change in your behavior or at least show your parents you are trying to change your approach to online activities. This might make them reconsider their actions and agree to an adjustment of the parental controls.

, If your parents or the administrator feel satisfied that you are responsible enough to manage your own online activities, they may provide you with the password to the administrator account.

, Some parents may not feel comfortable handing over complete access to the administrator account and leaving you unsupervised. So, if they request some restrictions or guidelines around your online use, try to be flexible and agree to them. It may take time for your parents to feel assured you can navigate content online without their supervision.

, While it may be tempting as a parent to install every block, limit, and filter on your child’s computer or on the shared home computer, be aware that new sites are added to the Internet every day so it is simply not possible for parental control software to catch every suspicious site.In fact, some parental control software can also block useful information like access to personal health issues and topics your child may need to be aware of.
Parental control software is not a substitute for active parent interaction with your children and conversations around their Internet use.

Yet, most parents also have an understanding that there are many advantages for children in knowing how to use and interact well on computers. Like any technological invention, the internet and computer can be used for both good and bad purposes, and the way in which parents present these tools to children is important. On the whole, the beneficial side is greater than the downside, but it all depends on your knowledge so that you know how to choose the right website for your kids.;
, There are many that have been created for children, fantastically creative, entertaining, and educational. These sites can vary dramatically in style, but children find them all enjoyable and easy to play.

Children can learn a great deal from this engagement. Websites that are available for children come in many varieties and options and many virtual locations and virtual people that resemble reality that a child can relate to and absorb.

, Check that there is lot available to explore: fun activities, animated stories, poems, brain games, quizzes, crafts, reading books, coloring pages, educational reference and much more for kids. Such activities will help your child to learn, improve memory skills, hone their own talents, etc.

Tell your kids about the computer’s location.,
Explain your interest in their accounts.,
Ask your kids how often they log on.,
Share with your kids that you’ve installed monitoring software on their devices.",How to Talk to Your Kids About Safe Social Media Use1," Explain that if the computer is in a central location – the family den or a shared office, for instance – you’ll be able to monitor what they are doing. Tell your child, “You will be less likely to engage in unsafe social media usage if the computer is in a central location, and I will have a better understanding of how you use your social media accounts.”, Tell your child, “I am interested in your social media accounts because social media use can be dangerous.” If you have an older elementary school-aged child or middle-school aged child, ask, for instance, “Will you show me how IMbee works?” For older teens, you should say, “I’d like to look at your social media chat log together today. Let’s take a look.”Check your child’s friends list. Request that your child delete people you disapprove of. Say, for instance, “I am uncomfortable with this online friend. Please block them and do not contact them again. Let me know if they try to contact you.”
Check your child’s profile as they see it, too. Some content can be hidden from certain users while remaining visible to others.
If your child chafes at the idea of you checking their social media accounts, say, “It’s quite reasonable. I get to know your friends at school, and I want to know your friends on social media, too.”You might also want to check your kids’ text messages and emails. Say, “I’d like to check your emails and text messages. Let’s view them together.”
View your child’s entire web history on all their devices. Look for social media networks that they might secretly have accounts on.

, When your child comes home from school – or when you come home from work – ask your child, “Have you been on social media today?” If they answer that they have, ask relevant follow-up questions. For instance, you might ask, “What social media apps did you use?” or “Did you post anything?” Letting your children know that you’re interested in their social media usage is the a good way to let them know that you're monitoring their behavior, which will inspire them to use care online.When your child first starts using social media, you should be monitoring their activity by checking their accounts frequently. This will allow you to understand what types of things your child is posting. If there is something potentially dangerous or embarrassing, you can talk to them about it. In their last few years as minors, check their accounts less frequently but still talk to them often about the dangers of social media.
Your child may react with anger, irritation, or defensiveness when you ask questions about their online use. In these situations, stay calm. Remind them that this is a part of the privileges of getting to own a phone or use social media. If they do not follow the rules, they will have to lose their internet and technology privileges.

, Monitoring software allows you to see what your kids are doing online, even when you’re not around. You can retroactively browse their web history, including what social media they were using. This is a great way to ensure they are not using social media too much (as well as guarantee that they are staying out of trouble in other corners of the internet). Being frank about what you can do to ensure your kids are using social media safely will discourage them from engaging in unsafe use.Say, “The monitoring software on your device will alert me to any unsafe social media usage. This is my way of looking out for you.”
Popular monitoring software for PCs includes Net Nanny and PureSight.
Phone monitoring software includes apps like My Mobile Watchdog.
Emphasize that privacy is earned through trust and good behavior. You can say, ""I only want to make sure that you are safe. Once you are old enough and have demonstrated that you are responsible, I won't need to check your accounts as often.""

Discourage your kids from using social media to bully others.,
Remind your teens not to text and drive.,
Warn your kids about the dangers of sexting.,
Teach your kids about the consequences of sharing things online.",How to Talk to Your Kids About Safe Social Media Use2," Even kids who are not bullies in real life might find that the anonymity and distance of the internet emboldens them to engage in bullying. Tell your kids that bullying is wrong in any situation. Furthermore, bullying others could lead to reprisals against them, and they might find themselves getting bullied in return. Ask your kids to talk about a time that they were bullied. Inquire how it made them feel. Say, “It is unkind to bully others. I want you to think about the time you were bullied when you use social media, and never engage in hurtful bullying.”, Texting and driving can be fatal. Say to your kids, “It only takes a moment’s inattention to cause an accident. Never use your phone while driving.” Encourage your child to turn their phone off while in the car so they aren’t tempted to log on to social media while driving.Use online videos and statistics to help educate your teen about the dangers of texting while driving.
Remind your teen that you can monitor their texting. Tell them that if you discover that they have texted even once while driving, they may lose their phone for an extended period of time.

, Tweens and teens often send nude images of themselves to the people they’re dating. This practice is known as “sexting.” These nude pictures are often sent via social media. When your child begins sex education, they might also get a lesson on sexting. But you should also initiate a conversation about sexting with them. Ask your child if they know what sexting is. For instance, you might ask, “Do you know what sexting is? Have any of your friends engaged in sexting?”


If they know what it is, ask them if they understand the potential consequences of sexting. Say, “Sexting is illegal in many places and could result in real trouble. If the person you sext with shares the images, you will never be able to regain control over those images of your body. This could lead to embarrassment for many years.”
Sexting is considered child pornography in many places. If your teen sends or receives nude photos of themselves or another minor, they can be charged with possessing and distributing child pornography. To illustrate the dangers of this, show your teen news stories of these events happening to other teens.
Show your child news stories about kids their age who have suffered serious consequences due to sexting. Ask, “Have you seen this news story? What do you think about this?”
Use the conversation about sexting to remind your child about the big picture – that they should always use social media responsibly.

, Remind your child that many things cannot be deleted once they’re put online, so if they send a picture or message on social media, it might never go away. Emphasize the importance of good judgment, and point out particular consequences of posting to social media. For instance, you might say:”If you send a nude picture to someone else, you could be charged with a crime.”
”If you post content about yourself that is sensitive or personal, you might be embarrassed later.”
”If you say something that offends or embarrasses others, you might get bullied online or in real life.”
""Try waiting an hour before posting something. Maybe even try sleeping on it. That way you can make sure it is not an impulsive decision.""

Ask your kids to show you what privacy features they’re using.,
Urge your kids to avoid questionable content.,
Tell your child to keep their password private.,
Tell your child to only friend their friends.,
Tell your child that they cannot use social media unless they are of the proper age.",How to Talk to Your Kids About Safe Social Media Use3," Privacy features vary with social media platforms, but some of the features you might look for and ask about include private posting, hiding personal details, login alerts and approvals, and registering devices to your account. Say to your child, “Please show me the privacy and security features that you’re using to stay safe on your social media accounts.”If you know of features that they should be using but are not, insist that they use them.
Your child should always use the highest levels of security and privacy when using social media. Say, “For your safety, please always keep your social media accounts on the highest possible settings.”, Ads touting free giveaways, questionnaires, and contests are often spam designed to collect personal information. Older kids might recognize these scams for what they are, but younger kids, especially, tend to have a hard time understanding the difference between a legitimate source and a scam. Teach your children to be wary of content of this sort.Say, “Sometimes social media is used by bad people to steal information. They might do it with things that look fun like questionnaires, quizzes, and contests. To stay safe on social media, ask my permission before clicking on this type of content.”, If your child shares their password, they could compromise their entire social media account, as well as other accounts that the account is linked to. Tell your child, “On social media, the password is like the lock on a house. It lets only the right people in and keeps bad people out. Never share your password with anyone.”Help your child understand that sharing any personal information is unsafe. For instance, tell your child, “Do not post or share personal information about yourself on social media, including your age, address, phone number, or date of birth.”
Show your child how you store your own passwords. By doing this, you will teach them how to safely protect their private information.

, Remind your child that it can be unsafe to talk to strangers, and online the same holds true. Even people who seem friendly on social media might have a sinister motive. Say to your child, “Don’t add just anyone on social media. Only connect with the friends you know in real life.”You may want to require that your child tells you whenever they add a friend online.

, Many social media platforms disallow users who do not meet certain age requirements. Facebook, for instance, requires that users are at least 13 years old. Twitter, Snapchat, and Kik, likewise, requires users are 13 years old or older. Yik Yak requires that users are at least 17 years old.Tell your child, “Some social media have rules about how old you can be before you use them. Let’s find a social media platform you can use safely at your age, instead.”
You may want to explain why these age restrictions are in place. For example, during adolescence, a teen or tween's brain can encourage riskier behaviors that may put them in danger online.
If your child is having a hard time finding a social media platform that allows them to participate, do some investigation and try to find one for them.
Popular social media platforms for kids younger than 13 include Club Penguin Island, WebKinz, and Whyville. These platforms offer a more structured experience than the one available on social media platforms designed for more mature audiences."

Let your kids know you use social media yourself.,
Provide disciplinary guidelines.,
Emphasize the importance of limits for responsible social media use.,
Ask your child to communicate with you.,
Talk to other parents about how they manage their children’s social media use.,
Be a good role model.",How to Talk to Your Kids About Safe Social Media Use4," If you use social media yourself, you’ll have a better grasp on what is possible and impossible on social media. This firsthand experience will also give you some credibility with your child, and let them know that you understand the attraction as well as the dangers of social media.


Say to your child, “I love using social media, but I always do it safely. If you have questions about how to use social media safely, just ask me.”
Model proper behavior on your own social media page. Show your child your accounts from time to time to demonstrate what is acceptable to post as well as how you protect your information.
If you’re using social media yourself, you can add your child’s profile to yours and monitor what they’re doing on the social media platform in question. Tell your child, “For added safety, let’s be friends on social media.”

, Your child should know not only what sort of social media use is expected of them, but also what consequences await them for violating your rules as a parent. For instance, you might say, “If I find that you’ve been talking to someone on social media that I told you not to talk to, I will revoke your social media use for a brief amount of time.” When talking with your children about safe social media use, let them know that unsafe use, or use that otherwise violates the rules you’ve laid out, will result in punishments.The punishments are up to you, but they should be fair. For instance, if you find objectionable content on your child’s social media account, remind your child that they need to be responsible when using social media. Say to them, “I told you that it is not acceptable to post offensive or objectionable content, so I am revoking online access for several days.”
Never strike, yell, or curse at your child when they violate your social media rules. These punishments will decrease the trust between you and make your child resent you.

, Overall phone and internet use should be limited to about one hour each day. If you feel uncomfortable with your child’s level of social media use, you could designate a limited amount of time that they can spend on social media each day. Suggest to your child that they spend the rest of their time engaged in their studies, socializing, and playing outside.Explain to your child that in order to help them succeed academically and personally, you want them to limit their social media usage. For instance, you might say to your child, “Do not use social media for more than 30 minutes each day. Instead of using social media, let’s go for walk.”
If you notice your kids’ academic performance start to slip, or notice that they’re skipping activities, these could be warning signs that your child is spending too much time on social media. Ask your child, “I think your social media use is interfering with your studies. Let’s talk about setting new limits you’re your social media use?”
Contact your pediatrician for advice if you think your child is spending too much time online.

, If your child sees something online that offends or scares them, they should feel comfortable sharing it with you. People often stumble upon content inadvertently, and your child might find something on social media that upsets them. Say to your child, “To keep you safe, I want you to tell me immediately when you find something that worries or scares you on social media, okay?” Ask your child to promise that they will always be honest with you about their social media use.Remind younger children to alert you if they ever encounter or receive nude images through social media. You might say, for instance, “Please tell me if you ever see pictures of people hugging or kissing with no clothes on.”
If your child informs you of something upsetting or potentially dangerous, remain calm. You want your child to trust you and to continue coming to you with these issues.

, Talking with other parents might give you additional ideas about how to talk to your kids about safe social media usage. You might also become aware of new social media updates or platforms that you should ask your child about. , Kids copy what they see their parents do. If you’re addicted to social media and use your phone even when driving, your kids will, too. Likewise, if you post controversial and offensive content, your kids will as well. One of the best things you can do to keep your kids safe when using social media is to post only innocuous content and avoid using social media too frequently."

Flip your PlayStation game over so that the shiny side faces you, and hold it steady.

,
Blow a short (but strong) puff of air at the surface to free loose dust.,
Use the cloth to gently wipe the shiny side, using straight strokes from the center out.Avoid wiping back-and-forth or in circular strokes, as they can scratch the surface!,
Dampen a corner of the cloth to wipe more the difficult areas.If there are tough-to-remove spots remaining, wet a corner of the cloth with cold water and rub the area again.,
Get some non-abrasive toothpaste that isn’t a gel.If you see some light scratches on the shiny side of your game, they can be buffed out with toothpaste.,
Hold the PlayStation game disc under cold water to get the shiny side wet.,
Apply (roughly) a dime-sized amount of toothpaste to your cloth.,
Gently rub toothpaste over the scratched area in straight strokes, starting from the center.,
Run the disc under lukewarm water until all toothpaste is removed from the game.,
Shake the remaining water from the game and leave it to dry, face up, at room temperature.Now that the game has been cleaned and buffed, it’s time to let it dry.",How to Clean Playstation Games,"
If you don't have a soft cloth, use a cotton t-shirt. Be sure to use an area of the shirt that doesn't have any logos. Logos are made from heavy inks and decals and could scratch the surface of your game.;
, It may help to insert a finger into the center for a good, solid grip.

,, If dust remains visible, try blowing again.

, Instead, wipe from the center to the edges, carefully rubbing out any smears or oily fingerprints.

, Be persistent, but be gentle—scrubbing will only make things worse.


If you have a water-based CD/DVD/game cleaner in a spray bottle, apply it to the backside and gently wipe with a dry area of the cloth. If there are specific instructions on the bottle, follow them.
Try using distilled vinegar on difficult oily spots. Vinegar can break down thicker residues and stains.If you clean the game with vinegar, give it a quick rinse in lukewarm water after.
Avoid using household cleaning products on your PlayStation games. Many products contain solvents that will irreparably damage the game.

, It’s important to make sure you’re using a variety that doesn’t have any chunky ingredients, like crystals or bits of dental strips—those additives can scratch the disc’s surface. It’s also important not to use a gel toothpaste, as it won’t be able to fill in the scratches.


To test your toothpaste, apply a little bit to the front of your hand and rub it in with your finger. If it feels gritty, don’t use it.
Most toothpaste labeled “sensitive” or “children’s” is non-abrasive.If the scratches are too deep, toothpaste won’t work.

,, Use more or less depending on the amount of scratches on the disc.

, Like removing dust and dirt, you’ll rub the toothpaste in only one direction (outward from the center), and never in a circular pattern. Stroke the scratched areas 10-15 times, applying more toothpaste if the motion feels dry.

, You may need to use the cloth to help remove the toothpaste, but again, never rub the cloth in any direction other than outward from the center.

, Never insert a wet disc into your PlayStation!


Any scratches remaining after using this method will need to be buffed out by a professional.

Be careful with your games.,
Store it properly.,
Keep your console away from any magnetic forces if it has an internal hard disk, or any storage disk at all.,
Avoid exposing the console to direct sunlight, or intense heat.,
Be very careful when handling the console.,
Do not touch the lens.,
Do not smoke near any electrical appliances, including games consoles.,
Do not play the console for too long, as this will also cause it to overheat.,
Unplug all cables that are connected before cleaning the console.",How to Make Your Games Console Last for Many Years," Never leave a disc inside the console when you are not using it, and always put a disc back in its case. Do not play with the discs, otherwise it will get scratched.;
, If you are not going to use your console for a very long time, unplug it and pack it away in its box. Take all discs and/or memory cards and/or controllers or other devices, and put them in appropriate storage places.

, This can harm the contents of the disk and corrupt game saves, and other files that are important.

, This may warp the exterior, and damage delicate internal components. The same goes for extreme cold. Just keep your console at room-temperature.

, You must not drop it, as doing so will damage delicate parts that make the console work properly. Also, do not drop controllers, DVD remotes, or other devices.

, The lens is what reads the discs you insert, and touching it will stop it from reading them properly. The lens is one of the most vital parts that keep the system working properly.

, The console's air intake will 'breathe' your smoke, which will clog up the airflow, causing dust to build up. Without proper ventilation, any electrical appliance will overheat, and will break it. Be sure to wipe the air intake fan every once in a while, to get rid of the dust.

, If you think your console feels too warm, switch it off, and do not play on it again until it is cool again.

, Refer to the console's instruction manual to find out how to clean it.

Purchase a fix it kit.,
Have the console professionally fixed.,
Have the console sent in to Microsoft.",How to Stop the Red Ring of Death on Xbox2," These kits typically come packaged with an Xbox 360 opener, new thermal paste, new heat sinks, and new washers. Some will include all of the screwdrivers you will need as well. Performing this fix yourself can be difficult, but can fix most cases of RRoD.









To fix it yourself, you will need to open the 360 and remove the motherboard from the case. After removing the motherboard, you will remove the heat sinks from the CPU and GPU. They are removed by prying the clamps off the back of the motherboard.
After removing the heat sinks, you will need to scrape off the old thermal grease and apply a new layer. You may need to use acetone or nail polish remover to remove the old thermal paste. After removing the thermal paste, you will remove the squishy thermal pads.
Replace the heat sinks and the thermal pads with the new parts and reassemble the Xbox.

, There are many establishments, both online and in brick-and-mortar shops, which offer Xbox repairs. They will essentially be performing the steps outlined above. They may also reflow the solder using a heat gun. These repairs can be costly, but may be more reliable than doing it yourself. Be sure to choose with a trusted establishment.








, If you are still under warranty, Microsoft will replace or repair your failed console. You may have to pay shipping or additional fees depending on the details of your warranty. If you are out of warranty, you can pay Microsoft a fee to repair the console. The fee is less if you register online here.

Understand what causes hardware failure.,
Keep you system in a well-ventilated area.,
Avoid long gaming sessions.,
Keep your system horizontal.,
Avoid stacking items on the Xbox.,
Clean your gaming area.,
Dust your Xbox.",How to Stop the Red Ring of Death on Xbox3," Heat is the number one cause of hardware failure for the Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 needs to be well ventilated in order to operate properly. Overheating can lead to a variety of hardware issues, leading to the failure of different components.









Excess heat warps the motherboard, separating it from the CPU and GPU chips.

, Do not place it in a cabinet or enclosed area. Make sure that other electronics are not close, and that none of the vents are blocked. Do not place your 360 on a carpeted surface, as it will not be able to vent out of the bottom.








, Constantly running your Xbox will increase the amount of heat it generates. Give your system breaks to allow it to cool down.








, There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that placing your system vertically decreases its ability to dissipate heat, as well as increasing the chances of scratched discs. Place your system horizontally on a hard, flat surface.








, Stacked items will reflect heat back into the system. Keep the top of your system clear.








, Make sure to dust the area regularly to keep particles from accumulating in the system. Dust the surroundings to reduce the amount of dust in the air.








, Use a vacuum to suck dust out of the vents. Wipe dust off of the system regularly. In extreme cases, you can open your case and use compressed air to blast dust off of the components.

Learn Some Batch.,
Get a Basic Idea of Your Game.,
Begin.,
Make The First File.,
After that is done, save it as START.bat, RESTART.bat, etc.,
Create Commands for Your Game.,
""if ""%1"" == ""torch"" goto torch"" is if they were to enter ""examine torch"".,
Start the Game.,
Once you near completion, add a README.txt file explaining the game and instructions to starting it in the game file.",How to Create a CMD Adventure," This will be easy; it will only take 5-10 minutes to learn. Most of the programming needed for this is explained in other articles like ""How to Create a Small Game in Batch"". Again, don't be worried about this step, for Batch is so easy a 10-year-old can learn it.;
, This part is crucial, but pretty easy. Just come up with things like the name of it, genre, etc.

, Create a new folder (preferably on your desktop) with the name of your game. Don't use any special characters or spaces, only letters, dashes, and underscores. An example is: ""mazes_and_monsters"". This way, Command Prompt will be able to open it.

, Open up Notepad, and write something similar to this:


@echo off
 :start
echo Mazes and Monsters
echo The MS-DOS Adventure
echo
echo Underground Cavern
echo You awaken in an underground cavern.
echo

, and put it in the game file.

, To do this, make a batch file for each command and place them in the game file. Like EXAMINE.bat. It would look something like this:


@echo off
if ""%1"" == ""torch"" goto torch
if ""%1"" == ""tree"" goto tree
 :torch
echo The torch is lit, and spreads light across the room.
echo.
 :tree
echo It is a tree.
echo.

, This does not have to be here. If it is a command that is not used on certain objects, it could look like this:


@echo off
 :start
echo You are in a dim cavern. You see a hallway going to the right and one to the left.
echo.
 :left door
echo The wooden door is barged shut and locked.

echo.

So, if you were to enter that command while you were accessing the :start label, it would show ""You are in a dim cavern. You see a hallway going to the right and one to the left,"" yet if you were to enter ""examine"" while accessing the :left door label, it would show ""The wooden door is barged shut and locked.""



, Once you're finished with most or the entire game, you'll want to test it. Open Command Prompt, make your way to your game file and open it. Remember when we created the ""START.bat"" file? We're almost to that. Now, type @echo off, cls, and ""start"". That will take you to that file, and voila. Try to enter the different commands, test some other things, etc.

, Then you're ready to go ahead and upload the game file to the World Wide Web.

, If you wish to work without the magic of the internet, download the Scratch 2.0 offline editor, available on the Scratch website. You do not need an account to download, but you will need Adobe Software to use it. If you are required to download the software, follow the instructions. You may also download the original Scratch 1.4 editor, but this guide won't fully cover it (this is a Scratch 2.0 guide!).

, You may find it on your desktop (or wherever you put it on the computer) or by clicking Create on the Scratch website. You will see 4 sections: The Canvas (the white area with the Scratch cat), The Coding Area (the blank gray area), The Sprite Screen (the gray area with a picture of a cat), and the Backpack.

, At the top of the screen, find five icons. Let's play with them all, from left to right. First, click the stamp icon. This is the duplicate tool. Move the cursor to the cat and click on it. You will see a second cat appear right next to it! Now click on the scissors. Click on one of the cats and it will disappear. This is called the Delete tool. Now click the icon in the middle. Keep clicking on the cat and it will grow. Click the icon next to it, and then keep clicking on the cat. The cat will start to shrink. The question mark icon is like a help function. Click on anything with the Help tool active and a Pop-up will show up explaining about the aspects of the selected thing.

, The cat on the white area (canvas) is called a Sprite. All the things on the canvas are Sprites and can be manipulated in many way. A simple technique is to click and drag the Sprite to anywhere on the canvas. In the Sprite area, select the sprite and hit the I button next to it. The sprite screen will change to show information of the current sprite. These are more advanced settings that are not discussed here, but try them out!


See those Lego bricks? They aren't lego. They are used in programming. Above the bricks are ten categories for those blocks. We will discuss them later.

, In traditional programming languages, you would probably just have print Hello World as your first ever program, but in Scratch, they don't follow that tradition. Instead, let's make our Sprite (the cat) move!


Select the cat and go to the coding section. In Scripts, choose the Events tab.
Drag the When Green Flag Clicked block to the main part. Notice the nub at the bottom of the block. This indicates which other blocks are compatible with this block, as all blocks have nubs or holes in them, like fitting together a jigsaw.
Go back to the Motion tab and drag a Move XX Steps block towards the other block you already placed.
If the edge of the first block turns white, let go of the mouse and the two blocks will snap together! If you want the cat to move farther in one go, change the value of the move block to 20, 40, 60, etc. (1 step = 1 pixel). Now click the green flag. The program will run and the cat will move.

,


Drag the blocks from your other program into the scripts screen and they will disappear. This program won't feature the cat, so right click him (or use the scissors) and click Delete. This program will use data, which in technical terms are called Variables and Lists. We won't discuss Lists this time.
Go to the Data tab. Click the button that creates the variable. Name it anything you want, but we will call it 'Clicks'. If you have an account, you can store the variable in the Cloud, but this requires an account, so we won't discuss it. Try it if you wish, though!
Once you finish creating a variable, 4 new blocks will appear. Let's create a Sprite. Next to 'New Sprite', click the Paintbrush.
Create a circle by clicking once (Top left corner of new circle) and then clicking on the opposite side of your new circle.
Add text by clicking inside the shape and typing. We recommend typing 'Clicks'. When you are done, go to the Scripts tab.
Drag the following blocks, in order: Green Flag, set (variable) to 0. In a separate area: when this sprite clicked, change (variable) by 1. Child's play, really.
Now start your program. When you click on your shape, the variable that you created should start going up. When you click the Green Flag again, the variable should return to 0.

, There are a lot more features, including new ones like custom blocks, that we have not discussed. We may discuss the more advanced features in a separate guide, but there is one extremely important feature if you have an account: Sharing.


There are over 4 million projects (as of Dec 7, 2013) in the Scratch community, and that number is growing fast. You can share and unshare your projects at the press of a button by clicking 'My Stuff' and clicking the appropriate button.

Check if the “Craft” button is clickable.,
Make the Choking Powder Cloud Trap.",How to Make Traps in Dragon Age: Origins," On leveling up, your character will have skill points to spend. If you want someone to be able to craft good high-end traps, then you will ultimately want them to have a full four points spent in trap-making.


You will not be able to become a master trap-maker right away. It will involve leveling and spending skill points on the trap-making tree multiple times. If you want to be a master as soon as possible, then spend a point on trap-making every time that you are capable of doing so.;
, There are four separate tiers, and each one allows you to create better traps.


The first tier allows you to make basic traps. You will need one skill point to spend in order to gain this tier.
The second tier allows you to make slightly more complex traps. You will need to be at least Level 4, have already unlocked the first tier of trap-making, and have another point to spend in order to gain this tier.
The third tier allows you to make third-tier traps. You will need to be at least Level 7, have already unlocked the first and second tiers of trap-making, and have another point to spend in order to gain this tier.
The fourth tier allows you to make all traps in the game. You will need to be at least Level 10, have already unlocked all previous tiers, and have another skill point to spend in order to become a master trap-maker.

, In order to actually make the traps, you’ll need to select the character with the trap-making skill points, and open up the crafting menu.


To do this, press “P” to open up the Skills and Talents menu. From here, it is advised that you drag the trap-making icon down to your quick-bar for easy access in the future. If you don’t want to, you can just double-click the trap-making icon to open up the crafting menu.

, To craft a trap, you will need to have unlocked the recipe for it, be at the right skill tier, and have the required ingredients.


As an example, Spring Trap Plans are automatically unlocked once a character reaches Tier 1 trap-making. Then, all you need to build it is one trap trigger.
If you have the trigger, the recipe will show up as craftable on your list, so click on the Spring Trap Plans. A window on the right will then show you the ingredients for the Spring Trap.

, If you have all of the ingredients, then the button that says “Craft” will be clickable. If you lack ingredients, you will not be able to click the “Craft” button.


By clicking the “Craft” button, you will make one Spring Trap. If you have the ingredients and want to make another Spring Trap, you will have to click “Craft” again.

, It requires a character to have all four tiers of the trap-making skill, and the recipe must be purchased from Alarith’s store in the Denerim Alienage. It also requires a larger and more varied amount of ingredients: 3 toxin extracts, 2 corrupter agents, 2 concentrator agents, and 1 trap trigger.


Only once you have fulfilled all of those requirements, will you be able to craft one of these high-end traps.

Choose your source component(s).,
When choosing tape decks be aware they were belt drive as were CD players until more recent years that need replacing.,
Choose an amplifier.,
Choose a set of speakers.",How to Buy Vintage Stereo Equipment," The source component is what you actually place the music media into - a turntable, a CD player, or tape deck, for example.


When buying a vintage turntable, look for a ""manual"" model; these tend to be more durable because there are fewer moving parts interacting with the tonearm. Make sure that the cartridge and drive belt have been recently replaced.;
, Be sure they are still available.


When choosing a vintage CD player, make sure to compare it carefully to modern models. Optical disc-reading technology has improved greatly since the 1980s, and many vintage CD players cannot reproduce sound as accurately as modern models.

, When selecting an amplifier for your stereo system, you have 3 options: a separate preamp and power amp, an integrated amp, or a stereo receiver (which is an integrated amp with a radio tuner). The 1970s are often considered a ""golden age"" for stereo receivers; receivers from this era sport the silver-faced and wood-wrapped aesthetic that has remained popular since.


A key consideration when choosing an amplifier or receiver is the total power available. An amp's power is rated as watts per channel, with smaller amps providing around 15 to 30 watts, and larger amps providing well over 100. For home listening, low-wattage amps will generally suffice.
Another consideration when choosing an amp is the ""total harmonic distortion,"" or THD. This number expresses how much the amp can be expected to degrade the signal quality. The best amplifiers (most from the 1970s fit this bill) will boast a THD of less than 0.1 percent.

, When selecting a pair of vintage speakers, a primary consideration is the size of the speaker cones. A larger woofer will be able to produce a fuller bass sound, for example. Speakers that have 3 cones (a woofer, mid, and tweeter) will generally produce a richer sound than speakers with only 2 cones. Many speakers also have power recommendations printed on the back panel - speakers can be damaged if under- or overpowered.

"
"
Place your speaker next to the power plug that is plugged into the wall.,
Place the speaker on the charging cradle.,
Your speaker should be charging.",How to Charge Your Bose Soundlink Mini,";
, You will hear a little tone that tells you that your speaker is plugged in and is charging.


If you have lost the charging cradle unit, or don't want to use it, plug the AC adaptor into the wall (If it's not in) then plug the cord into the input on the bottom right-hand side of the speaker.

,


If the speaker is not charging, take it back to the shop to get it fixed or replaced.

"
"
Establish a target listening area.,
Place the target seat in a good position.,
Hang some thick, rough textured fabric along the wall behind the target listening area.,
Place your speakers facing the target area at sixty degree angles.,
Ensure that the speakers and the target listening area are all equidistant.,
Use a tape measure or string to determine the distance from your amplifier to your speakers.,
Keep in mind that if your speakers and your amplifier are in the same room, 16-gauge wire is inexpensive and will be sufficient.,
Purchase the wire that you have determined is correct for your needs.,
Make sure all your components are completely unplugged.,
Prepare your wires for connection.,
Split the wire down the center for a couple of inches.,
Determine how the wires are to be connected to the speakers.,
Insert the wires into the corresponding sockets.,
Fasten the connected wires into place.,
Make sure you hide the wires or tape them to the floor.",How to Wire Speakers," Perhaps this is a couch, love seat or your favorite chair.;
, The ideal placement is halfway between the two side walls and at least a couple of feet back from the exact center of the room.


Avoid placing the target seat all the way up against the back wall of the room. Flat surfaces such as walls tend to shatter the sound a little before reflecting it, so you will get a better effect if you leave a buffer between the back wall and the target.

, This will help to rectify the distortion of reflected sound.

, They should be at least one foot out from the back wall and at least two feet away from the side wall for optimal sound quality.

, This means the distance should be the same between all three parts, creating a perfect equilateral triangle.

, This will tell you how much speaker wire will be required for the job.

, Longer distances require a thicker wire because of the increased risk of a power failure. For distances between 80 to 200 feet (24.4 to 61 m), you need a 14-gauge wire. Distances greater than 200 feet (61 m) require the thicker 12-gauge wire.


12-gauge wire may be used in any speaker setup, even if the distance between the amplifier and the speakers is not terribly great. Some audiophiles swear by the extra quality and durability you get for the price.

, It never hurts to grab a little extra. You never know when you might need to extend the wires.

, No signal should be running through anything while you hook up speakers.

, Examine the wire and take note of any differences between coloring on either half. Is one half of the insulation colored red, and the other black? Is the insulation clear with subtle differences in the colors of the wire beneath? This information will be useful later.

, Then use wire cutters or scissors to trim away the insulation around the first inch of each wire. This should leave you with a length of exposed wire at the end of each section.


Keep the ends of all the wires separated throughout this process. Bend the exposed sections away from each other in a Y shape before connecting them to anything. Make sure the metal at the end of each exposed section is twisted to a point for easy insertion.

, Some speakers come with wire sticking out of a hole in the back of the cabinet. Others have a row of little sockets for you to connect wires to. It should match a row of sockets on the back of your amplifier which looks something like this:

, It is important to keep things consistent throughout this step on a couple of different levels.


Look for ""L"" and ""R"" to indicate the left and right speakers. Be certain you are wiring the speaker on the right side of your rig to the socket labeled ""R"" on the back of your amplifier. Same goes for left and ""L"".
Take advantage of the color coding on the sockets when connecting wires. This will help you to make sure the polarity (+ vs - charge) is consistent throughout your rig. It does not matter which end of the wire you use for black or red, only that you remain consistent.

, This is usually done using the colored switches somewhere along the outside of each socket.


Confirm that each wire is leading from red to red and black to black. You should do this before giving power to the system. It never hurts to be extra sure since wiring inconsistencies can ruin your equipment. A fully connected rig looks like this:

, This will prevent people from tripping over them and accidentally ripping the wires out of their sockets.

"
"
Set all the EQ bands on 0, or in the middle.,
Listen to your audio through the speaker to determine if it needs anything.

,
Remember that the left side of the unit, usually starting around 20, is the low or bass side; the right, usually ending at around 16k, is the high or treble side.,
Adjust the equalizer accordingly once you have that down.

,
Turn the volume to the desired level when the equalizer is where you want it.

",How to Use a Graphic Equalizer," This will make the audio come out of the speaker without any effects.;

This is assuming that you need a stand for a relatively large speaker.,
Assuming that he does, bring them home and carefully place your speakers on the crates, one speaker per crate.

,

Keep cable lengths short.,
Use shielded cable.,
Avoid tight turns or kinks in the cable.,
Match balanced receiving and sending devices.,
Avoid noise pick up from power cables.",How to Wire Audio Cables," Use only enough cable to connect the 2 devices. Avoid leaving excess cable rolled up and in danger of picking up outside noise. This also will help to reduce the impedance that the cabling presents between the sending and receiving devices. A good rule of thumb is to keep cable lengths 4 or 5 meters (13.2 or 16,5 feet.) Some professional equipment is specially designed to operate with cable lengths of 10 or 20 meters (33 or 66 feet.) Consult your equipment manuals for more information.;
, Cables come with many types of shielding. The most effective cable shielding types are foil or woven metal. Avoid using conductive plastic or wrapped wire screens.

, Particularly in foil screen cables, this can crack or separate the shield and reduce the efficiency of the screen.

, If both the sending and receiving devices are balanced, make sure that the screen is connected to ground at both ends.


Compensate for an unbalanced sending device. If the sending device is unbalanced, leave the cable screen disconnected at the receiving device. Connect the minus signal of the cable to the pin of the receiving device that would have otherwise accepted the cable screen.
Allow for an unbalanced receiving device. If the receiving device is unbalanced, connect the minus signal to the screen at the sending device. Consult your equipment manual to see if the sending device is fully floating. If the sending device is fully floating, do not connect the minus wire at the sending device.

, Do not run audio cable so that it lays alongside power cables. If the audio and power cables must cross, make the cross at right angles to minimize noise pick up in the cable.

Check that your speakers are not already shielded.,
Place each of your speakers at least two or three feet away from any vulnerable devices.",How to Shield Speakers1," Many recent models, especially those designed for use with computers or home theater systems, come with built-in shields. Large speaker cabinets such as guitar amps often do not have shielded magnets.


Consult the user's manual for information specific to your speakers. There may also be a panel on the back of your speaker or sub woofer with a bunch of fine print. Sometimes this will mention whether or not the device will cause harmful interference.
Try using an electromagnetic field detector if you are not sure. These are reasonably inexpensive and can be used to determine if the existing shield has been damaged.
In case you are curious, there is no need to shield your speaker wires.;
, This should be considered a safe distance for magnetic interference.


Keep in mind that vibrations from loud sound may cause other kinds of damage to delicate components such as hard drives. Electromagnetic interference is also increased when speakers are used at high volumes. Extra distance may be necessary if you will be blasting your speakers regularly.

"
"
Open the back of the speaker cabinet and identify the magnet.,
Measure the size and shape of the magnet.,
Purchase the shield material.,
Secure the shield in place.",How to Shield Speakers2," This should be a donut-shaped object directly on the back of the speaker cone.

, You will need to have this information when selecting the right shield.

, This can be any magnetic metal large enough to cover the back of the magnet.


Consider the most readily available materials first. Common steel items like pipe-caps for air ducts or electrical steel junction boxes will do the job nicely. Best of all, you can find them at any hardware store.
Special products may be purchased which are designed especially to shield speaker magnets. They are just thick enough to shield the magnet, but are also thin enough to be cut with scissors for just the right shape.

, Use a strong adhesive tape to bind your shield to the speaker.

Check to see what expansion ports you have on your motherboard.,
Find a Bluetooth module that connects via that port.,
Crack your computer open and physically put the module into place.,
Make sure the part registers as installed.,
Install the software only if needed.,
Test it out.",How to Install a Bluetooth Module (Not Adapter) in a Computer," If you have an OEM machine (like a Dell Optiplex desktop or a laptop of any stripe) you can typically Google the User's Manual for the model number of your computer (so, for example, Dell PowerEdge 2950 User Manual). Once there, check the Table of Contents for a section labeled Expansion.;
, The most common Bluetooth modules (aside from the aforementioned USB) use PCIe, mSATA and M.2. There's no inherent difference between the various ports, in terms of quality of connection; just make sure you buy a module from a manufacturer you trust.

, If this is your first time taking your computer apart, search YouTube for a Disassembly video for your particular module of computer. Follow along with the video.


Some expansion ports, like Mini PCIe, typically don't require you to take your computer apart.)
 If this step scares you a little too much, there is a paid alternative. Most big box computer retailers (like Best Buy or MicroCenter) will let you bring in your machine and the part to be installed, and they'll do it for you, for a fee.

,


For Windows this means going into Device Manager (Start > Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Device Manager, requires Administrator access). Look for (hopefully) a new entry labeled Bluetooth, or barring that, a new Unidentified Device with a yellow triangle. 
For Mac users, ...why are you here? Every Mac since the late 2000s came with Bluetooth preinstalled. If you're replacing a dead Bluetooth module, the new one should appear in the Bluetooth menu under System Preferences; if you're creating a Hackintosh, you are officially beyond the scope of this article.
Linux users will want to check the man files for their particular flavor of Linux, when it comes to installing new hardware.

, Installing software is really only an issue if you didn't get your Bluetooth device to show up in Device Manager as a Bluetooth device. Go to the manufacturer's website for the Bluetooth module you purchased, and download the drivers appropriate to your particular flavor of Windows (7, 8, 8.1, 10, and x32 vs x64 as appropriate. All of this information is available by going to Start > Control Panel > System and Security > System, under Windows Edition). Run the installer for the drivers, let it process, and reboot the computer as necessary.

, Now, the moment of truth - syncing to a Bluetooth peripheral, like a keyboard or headset.


For Windows users, go back to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound; there should be an option now for ""Add a Bluetooth device."" Make sure your Bluetooth peripheral is in pairing mode (consult the manual for this), then click ""Add a Bluetooth device"" and wait while your computer's Bluetooth module looks for the Bluetooth peripheral. Select your peripheral as it appears, enter any security codes (the default for most is 0000, but check your documentation if they use specific ones), and follow your way through the wizard, and you should have a functioning Bluetooth device.
For Mac users, the process is very similar. Under System Preferences > Internet and Wireless > Bluetooth, you should get a small window for bluetooth peripherals. Make sure you check the box for ""On"" so your computer turns its new Bluetooth module on. Just like for the Windows users, make sure your peripheral is in pairing mode (consult its manual for this), then find it in the listing in the Bluetooth Peripheral window and double-click on it. Follow the prompts, enter any security codes or PINs the computer calls for (again, most default to 0000, but check your peripheral's documentation to be sure), and you should have a functioning Bluetooth device at the end.

Fingers interlaced over the head.,
Cervical (neck retraction).,
Remember to get up and stretch your legs.,
Air Fresheners.,
Blink your eyes every second.,
Look away every 2 minutes.,
Close your eyes every 20 minutes.",How to Relax at the Computer," With fingers interlaced, reach overhead, turn your palms upward. This position is held for ten seconds. Relax, rest for a few seconds and then repeat this cycle five times.;
, Put your hand against the temporal area and push the head to the opposite side and hold it with resistance for five seconds. Do the same on the opposite temporal, push against it and then push the head back against it with resistance and hold for five seconds. Then put your hand on the forehead and push against the forehead with resistance for five seconds. Then put your hand in the back of the head and push it forward and resist it for five seconds. Do three cycles of each of those four exercises.

, Every 10-15 minutes, remember to take a quick break. Your legs can get sore and achy from being bent and it's good for your circulation. Even if you don't get up to get or do anything, just stand up from your chair and walk around the room for a moment.

, Like any other area where you relax, keeping a simple air freshener nearby never hurts. If you prefer incense just keep it a safe distance from your computer since electronics don't mix very well with smoke.

, Blinking is the best exercise for our eyes. It relaxes them by providing moisture to the eyes. So blink as often as possible to prevent your eyes from drying out.

, After every 2 minutes, relax your eyes by looking away from the computer. Just look as far away as possible for 4-5 seconds and then get back to work. This will prevent your eyes from quickly tiring out.

, Relax your eyes after every 20 minutes by closing them. Rub your palms vigorously and place them lightly on your eye lids for about 30 seconds. Do this thrice. Keep your eyes shut throughout these 2-3 minutes. This exercise will give your eyes the much needed break from the brightness of the computer and your vision will be much clearer.
