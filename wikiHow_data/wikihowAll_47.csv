Understand how git fetch and git pull work.,
Understand how git push works.",How to Use Git Effectively," A ""repository"" is a collection of files that is the basic unit on which git operations are performed. Usually a git command operates on only one repository at a time (there are exceptions, for instance when dealing with submodules).

On your machine, a repository includes a directory and all files in it and (recursively) in its subdirectories.
It is possible to explicitly tell Git to ignore (i.e., not track) particular files or all files (recursively) inside a particular directory. The list of files and directories to exclude is in the .gitignore file. Files that are ignored will not be tracked with Git, and they may not be synced between different copies of the Git repository. It is generally considered good practice to remove large files and redundant files (such as executables that are obtained by compiling from the source code already present) from the Git repository, to keep its size manageable (since Git keeps track of many versions of a file, things can get quite unwieldy with large files).All copies of the same Git repository, when synced, should have the same subdirectories and files, excluding those that are marked with .gitignore. If you are using GitHub or Bitbucket, the files you see when browsing online, or the files you get when you first clone the repository, will not include any ignored files.
All git commands associated with a repository can be run from the command line (UNIX or Linux terminal or Git bash) from any directory within the repository. Being in the top (root) directory of the repository is not necessary.;
, The ""remote origin"" for your local Git repository is the place that you first cloned the Git repository from. By default, this is referenced as origin in various git commands, though you can change the name to something else.In a typical collaborative Git setup, there is a single remote origin for all users (managed by GitHub, Bitbucket, or Git running on their server) and all synchronization happens through that remote origin, i.e., each collaborator pushes to and pulls from that remote origin, rather than directly to another collaborator. Note, however, that it is possible to have a different architecture.,

A ""commit"" is a checkpoint of a complete state of the Git repository. Each commit has a unique identifier and it is possible to revert to any commit. Each commit includes a commit time, a committing user, and optionally, a commit message (that should ideally describe the most recent changes included in the commit).
A ""branch"" can be thought of as a version of the Git repository. The default branch is called ""master"". At any point, a new branch can be created cloning the existing state of the Git repository. The branches can subsequently diverge. One can switch between branches, and one can eventually merge branches.
The term HEAD is used for the most recent commit. In each repository, each branch has a HEAD.
The ""status"" of the repository provides information on the current branch, what changes may have been made that are not committed, and whether the changes are synced with the remote origin. If there are no uncommitted changes, then git considers the status to be clean (another way of saying this is that the branch is at its HEAD). A clean status reports an empty result when you run git status --porcelain. Note that changes to files marked to be ignored are not considered when reporting the status.

, In this respect, Git is a substitute for version control systems like Subversion (SVN), with the key distinction that whereas SVN operates at the level of individual files, Git operates at the level of the repository.
The most relevant git commands here are git stage (synonymous to git add) and git commit.
Other related commands are git reset, git mv, and git rm.
You can see the full commit history using git log.

,

It is possible to create multiple branches of your repository where you work on different changes.
The most relevant commands for creating and switching between branches are git branch and git checkout.
The relevant command for reconciling changes between branches is git merge (more generally, git merge can be used to try to merge any two commits, and the commits at the HEAD for two different branches are a natural candidate for things to merge).

,

To push changes from your local repository to the remote origin, use git push.
To get changes from the remote origin into your local repository, use git fetch (this simply fetches the changes) or git pull (this fetches and merges the changes in).
The ""collaboration"" you get in Git is conceptually quite different from the kind of collaboration you get with tools like Google Docs or Hackpad. The latter emphasize real-time collaboration where participants are usually online and editing simultaneously, with a single global state of the document at all times. Git, on the other hand, works on a model of offline changes that are then merged (if two different users make changes separately from the same starting point).
Git is more similar to Dropbox, in the sense that in both, there are local copies that can be edited offline, and there is a step of syncing the local copy to the remote origin (if a user is online and has Dropbox running then the changes will be made in real time). However, Dropbox does not handle multiple people editing the same file offline well, because it does not have a method of merging changes within a single file. Git's ability to merge changes within a single file is crucial to its usefulness for source code management.

,


Branching and merging depends somewhat on committing: Without clear checkpoints recording particular states of the repository, branching would be hard to manage.

Collaboration and branching share reliance on the ability to merge: The ability to merge changes, whether between different branches in a local repository, or within the same branch but between the local repository and remote origin, is a critical part of Git's utility.

,

Only (1): Git can be used purely as a checkpointing system for a linear (sequential) workflow. Changes are made in a particular sequence and the state is recorded periodically through commits. This makes it easy to, if necessary, revert to a previous commit and start afresh from there, while expecting this to be a rare occurrence. This use case is most common for a single user working on a single file.
Only (2): Git can be used primarily as a way of handling cases where you want to work on two different changes in parallel, without letting them interfere with one another, and merge when they are completed. If using Git this way, you would commit only when you want to start branching, when you are switching between branches, and when you are finished with work on the branches and want to merge.
Only (3): Git can be used primarily as a way of transferring files between different devices you may be working on, plus keeping a remote backup. In this case, you commit only when you wish to push to the remote, which you do either when you wish to back up the files or when you are switching devices or handing over the work to another user. Here, the primary advantage of Git is that it's easier and faster than emailing files over, particularly if you are working on the same repository repeatedly but have a large and/or regularly changing set of files.
(1) and (2): Git can be used as a system for checkpointing and branching/merging for a single user. The remote origin plays no particular role (and there may not even be a remote origin!).
(1) and (3): Git can be used as a system for checkpointing and for collaborating across multiple users (e.g., one user works on the code in one timezone, then hands it off to the other user who works in another timezone).
(2) and (3): Git can be used primarily for branching and collaboration, with infrequent checkpointing.
All of them!: This is how most sophisticated Git-using teams use it.

, A general best practice guideline for Git is that it should always be used for at least (1) even if that is not the primary reason one is using Git. In other words, it is good to commit often. This is because the benefits of having checkpoints are significant, and the costs are negligible. Whether and how to use (2) and (3) (in particular, whether it's a good idea to push frequently, and whether it's a good idea to branch out regularly instead of working from master) generally depends on workplace best practices and your particular use case.The one main counterpoint is that once a change has been committed, it is very hard to permanently erase it from the Git repository. Therefore, never commit any changes that have sensitive information in them that you might later regret other people finding out., Of these, the saving step is something you handle through your editor or IDE (i.e., the same methods that you would otherwise use). The pushing step, referenced as Step (3) in Part 2, has to do with keeping the remote origin synced up with your local Git repository. The stage-and-commit step, referenced as Step (1) in Part 2, is what checkpoints the code.

The set of files and file changes that have been saved are called the ""working directory"" and the set of files and file change that have been staged are called the ""staging area"".
As a general rule, only changes that have been saved (i.e., recorded on disk) can be staged, only changes that have been staged can be committed, and only changes that have been committed can be pushed.
In particular, it means that if you have some unsaved changes, then they will not get staged even if you run git stage on those files. If you have some non-staged changes, they will not get committed even if you run git commit. If you have uncommitted changes, they will not get pushed even if you run git push.
In a simple scenario where you are working in the master branch and are not doing anything too subtle, your workflow is: save changes, then run these two commands: git commit -am ""Description of your changes"" followed by git push origin master.

,

Staging a change basically means that you are telling git to record this change in the next commit. You can stage file edits, addition of new files, deletion of files, and renaming of files.
It is possible to stage-and-commit together, by using git commit -a. The ""-a"" option tells git to stage all changes to existing files before committing. In fact, many Git users never stage changes explicitly, and simply use git commit -a as the default behavior. However, newly added files are not staged by default, and need to be staged by manually running git add or git stage as discussed later.
One reason we want to stage changes explicitly rather than committing them is that we may accidentally start work on multiple changes that should logically be part of separate commits (for instance, you may be making edits to the documentation, to the code, and to the configuration, that you would like to checkpoint separately). In this case, it makes sense to stage all the changes we'd like to put in a particular commit, commit that, then stage the next set of changes, commit that, and so on.
Another reason is that there may be some changes we make that we don't want to commit at all, but that we need to make concurrently with other changes that we do want to commit. For instance, suppose you are making changes to your code, that you are testing by running your code locally. To facilitate debugging, you have set the log-level in the configuration to DEBUG, but you want the log-level in your committed code to always be INFO. You also want to keep committing your changes to the code. In this case, you can keep staging and committing the code files while not staging the file with the log-level configuration, and when you are done with testing you can revert the change to the file with the log-level configuration.

,

To tell git to stage a change, you can do git add or git stage followed by the name of the file. This stages all changes to that file made between the previous commit and the most recently saved version of the file. This means that if you do not do any more staging, then the next time you do a git commit, these changes will get committed.
If you make and save changes to a file, stage the file, make and save further changes, and then commit, only the changes made prior to the staging are committed.
If you stage a file repeatedly between commits, git does not keep track of previous stagings. In other words, git does not checkpoint uncommitted stages. Rather, outside of commits, git keeps track of only two states: all staged changed, and all saved changes. It does not keep track of multiple stages.
You may stage multiple files. These will not interfere with one another.
You can unstage changes to a file (and revert to the previous commit) by doing git reset HEAD followed by the file name. You can unstage all changes by doing git reset HEAD. Note that git reset HEAD in and of itself does not actually unsave the changes.
You can unsave unstaged changes to a file by doing git checkout -- followed by the file name.
You can unstage and unsave all changes (i.e., actually change all files to the way they looked as of the previous commit) by doing git reset --hard.

,

The git status command prints out information about the list of files where changes are staged but not committed (this list is printed in green on a color terminal) and the list of files where changes are saved but not staged (this list is printed in red on a color terminal).
In particular, these two lists could potentially overlap. This happens if you make and save changes, then stage them, and then make and save further changes to some of the same files.

git status does not show the precise changes that were made to the files. You can get a list of saved-but-not-staged changes using git diff. To get a list of staged-but-not-committed, use git diff --staged (on older versions of Git, you may need to use git diff --cached).Once you have staged all changes, git diff should return nothing. Once you have committed all changes, git status should report that your working directory is clean, and git status --porcelain should return nothing.
If some of the files you added should not be part of the Git repository (for instance, they are compiled files, or they are configuration files local to your system) be sure to add the files, or a subdirectory containing only such files, to the .gitignore. This helps you stay clean.

, The best way to commit is to use one of these two methods:

If you are staging all changes as part of the commit itself: git commit -am ""Description of the changes in your commit""

If you have already staged the changes you want to commit: git commit -m ""Description of the changes in your commit""


, A few pointers.

The standard pushing command if you are in the master branch is git push origin master

If you are in another branch, you should do git push origin branchName. Branches are discussed later.
When you push, you send the remote origin not just your recent commit but all previous commits as well. The HEAD (most recent committed state) of the remote origin will match that of your most recent commit, but the remote origin (and therefore any other repository that clones from or fetches from it subsequently) will have access to previous commits. This is why pushing immediately after committing does not matter too much, and it is also why it is critical to make sure you never commit anything that has sensitive security information.
According to some schools of thought, you should pair every commit with a push, so that every local checkpoint is recorded immediately on the remote origin. However, other schools of thought say that you should commit often, but push occasionally.You may set different standards for committing and pushing. For instance, you may set a rule that every commit should at minimum compile, whereas you will push to the remote origin only after the code has been tested. The precise guidelines depend on your use case and the guidelines your team decides.
Note that when working collaboratively, i.e., if others are making changes to the remote origin, your push may fail because others have made changes. In this case you need to pull (and if necessary, merge conflicts and commit), and then push again.

,


Branches intended for merging back into master: One practice often used is to start a git branch whenever working on a new, reasonably nontrivial feature, then keep committing and pushing within that branch, and once the feature is fully tested, merge that branch back into master. The merging step itself might be controlled: not everybody may have permission to merge into master, so the merge is submitted as a pull request, and the administrator approves the merge. Often, the branches are tied to git issues (tickets for feature changes).

Branches intended as slight modifications of master: You might create a branch that modifies some configuration settings from master so as to facilitate a use case such as local testing. In this case, your new branch will not have many commits of its own, and will not be merged into master. However, it will regularly be merging in from master. For instance, a branch that you create that has slightly different configurations for local testing might be used by you sporadically to test recent changes to master; every time you use it this way, you pull in from master.

Branches that diverge for good: In this case, the branch leaves the master for good. It may or may not continue to be developed further. In some cases, it may be used simply as an easier checkpoint of an earlier state of the project. In other cases, it may be developed further or even into a separate fork of the repository.

, The second command creates the branch and switches to it.
With both commands, the entire current state is transferred to the new branch. This means that the commit history till this point, the staging area (i.e., the set of staged-but-not-committed changes), and the rest of the working directory (i.e., the set of saved-but-not-staged changes), all get inherited by the new branch.
To switch to an already existing branch in your local repository, do git checkout branchName

The save-stage-commit-push workflow within a branch is the same as for master. The key difference is that when pushing, you need to use git push origin branchName instead of git push origin master

It is also possible for multiple people to collaborate on the same branch. The first person to create the branch simply does git push origin branchName. People who subsequently want to collaborate on that branch must do git fetch origin branchName so that their local repository gets that branch, and subsequently they can work on it in the same way as the person who created the branch.

,
However, git attempts to transfer all the staged-but-not-committed changes as well as all the saved-but-not-staged changes. It prints out these files to the terminal. Existing files are printed with a ""M"" prefix whereas new files are printed with an ""A"" prefix.
If any of the files to which either set of changes applies is different in the two branches, git will throw an error, telling you to commit, stash, or discard your changes to avoid them being overwritten by checkout. If the changes involve adding new files that you have not yet staged, git will print an error about untracked working tree files.

,

If you are making all your changes in master, then pushing incomplete changes to the remote origin can be disruptive to collaborators and confuse any person or automated process that deploys directly to production from the remote origin. If, however, you are in your own branch, then you can push this branch to the remote origin. It will not affect the copy of the master in the remote origin, and therefore not disrupt anything.
A problem can arise if different people are using the same name for different local branches. For instance, if everybody uses a branch name called ""testing"" for their own local testing branches, these can confuse git when they attempt to push the branch to the remote origin. It is therefore good practice to choose a distinctive name, and to push to the remote origin early on to ""reserve"" the name so that other collaborators don't use the same name accidentally.

,

It is generally good practice to first update your master from the remote, e.g., using git checkout master and then git pull origin master

It is preferable to first merge in from master into your branch rather than the other way around, so that your local master branch is not corrupted by a bad merge. If you wish, you can create a third branch just for merging, though this is usually overkill.
To merge in from master into your branch, do git checkout branchName followed by git merge master. If you are okay with the default merge edit message, use git merge --no-edit master. If you want to merge from master into a branch without switching to the branch you are merging into, do git merge master branchName.
The merge may execute without conflicts. In this case, Git automatically creates a merge commit with the default commit message (or your own edit message if you chose to enter one).
Examine the changes and do any further testing to make sure that any changes that occurred to master while you were working on your branch do not interfere with the functionality of what you did. Note that just because Git merges without conflicts does not imply that the merge is non-problematic: there could be subtle semantic problems introduced by the merge that will become apparent only after you compile, test, or run your code.
Once you are confident that your changes are good, do git checkout master and git merge --no-edit branchName. There should be no conflicts at this time. Now, do git push origin master.
You may want to delete your branch by doing git branch -D branchName, or you may want to preserve it. Note that even if you delete your branch, all its associated commits are preserved if you have merged it into master.
When merging, there is an option to ""fast-forward"" changes that is active by default on the command line. This will effectively avoid creating a separate commit for the merge if it is not necessary, i.e., if the branch being merged into has had no changes to it since the other branch diverged from it. The ""merge pull request"" option on GitHub by default does not fast-forward changes, so as to always provide an identifiable commit responsible for the merge.You can deactivate this option to by doing --no-ff. As a general rule, fast-forwarding makes sense for short-lived branches but non-fast-forward merges make the commit history easier to understand and more faithful to reality.In some cases, the merge may generate conflicts. This usually happens if both branches have made edits to the same file in a way that Git can't automatically reconcile. Git's default behavior is to replace the file with a file where each of the conflicting sections is marked. You have to manually examine and clear the conflicts. While this is sometimes easy, it is often easier to just discard the failed merge and manually attempt to understand the sets of changes and figure out how to merge them. In the worst case, the badly merged file can just be overridden by a new, rewritten file. Such manual merges need to be explicitly committed after the merge is completed. Until this commit is done, git is in an ""unresolved index"" state and does not allow you to switch branches.
Another way some people prefer to merge is by first rebasing. Rebasing rearranges the commit history to have the commits in the branch being merged from happen first, and then execute the commits in the branch being merged to. In other words, it rewrites the history of the order in which the commits happened: rather than keep the full branched history of the commits, it pretends that the commits in the branch being merged to happened later in a linear flow. Since rebasing involves a rewrite of the branch history, it is considered a dangerous option for beginners but it can be quite useful at times.Note that in the absence of merge conflicts, rebasing will always avoid creating additional merge commits. Fast-forwarding avoids additional merge commits only if there are no additional changes in the branch being merged into. We can think of fast-forwarding as a special case of rebasing in the case where no changes have been made in the branch being merged into.

git fetch origin branchName fetches the version of the branchName branch from the remote origin and stores it under the name origin/branchName and can be manipulated in a way similar to local branches. Note that this requires one to be able to connect to the remote server.

git pull origin branchName is shorthand for the following pair of commands: git fetch origin branchName, followed by git merge origin/branchName. Note that only the first of these requires connectivity to the remote server. If git merge origin/branchName is run in isolation, it does not connect to the remote server, instead simply running the merge from whenever the fetch previously occurred.
As with all merge efforts, if there are no changes to merge (i.e., if all changes in the remote are already present locally) then it will print ""Already up-to-date.""
There may, however, be changes to merge and conflicts to resolve, and you need to deal with them the same way as you deal with merges between branches, as described in Step (5) of the previous part.
It is generally not good practice to run git pull origin branchName if your working directory is unclean, because the pulled-in changes may conflict with uncommitted changes in your working directory.

,

If you run git status, then git will inform you if it notices that your local version of your current branch is ahead of the most recently fetched remote version. Note that git will not try to fetch a remote version unless explicitly told to do so, so this is based on potentially outdated information. Note also that unpushed changes do not compromise git's evaluation of whether the worrying directory is clean.
If you run git push origin branchName, git attempts to push your changes to the remote origin. At this time, if git discovers that there were changes on the remote origin that are not in your local version, the attempt will be rejected. You would then need to do git pull (as described in Step (1)).

To find them, you should search the Internet for “electronic signature provider.” Some of the more popular e-signature providers include:Sertifi
RightSignature
eSignly
DocuSign
Signix;
, Many e-signature providers allow you to use a free trial. You should sign up for a free trial so that you can compare the experience of using each service.


To sing up, visit the website and click on “Start Free Trial” or a similar link.You will be prompted to create a username and password. You also will enter your personal information (name, title, company, and phone number).

, You should use each platform to send contracts and see if you find the service easy to use. You want a platform which integrates well with your current business needs.


For example, if you send mostly PDFs, then you want the platform to be able to handle that type of file.

, Most e-signature platforms require that you pay a monthly fee. The amount can vary, with prices of $10-30 a month common.You should find the most up-to-date prices by visiting the platform’s website.


Check to see if you can get a discount for purchasing the service for an entire year. For example, an e-signature provider might charge $12 a month but only charge $99 for an entire year.

, Take out a piece of unlined computer paper and sign your name several times. Try to make the signatures different sizes, because some sizes will look better when scanned into a digital image.You can experiment using different pens, e.g., felt-tip or gel pens. Be sure to use a dark color, preferably black.

, Put the paper face-down on the scanner and scan.Make sure that the resolution is sufficiently high. For example, you probably shouldn’t go below 600 dpi.

, Open the digital file and look at all of the signatures on the page. Find one that is the clearest. You will want to copy that one, using the magic wand feature on Photoshop.


If none of your signatures look clear, then write your name again on a different piece of paper. Choose different types of pens as well. If you used a gel pen for the first round of signatures, choose to use a felt-tip pen to see if it creates clearer, stronger signatures.

, You can find the magic wand tool by clicking on the “Quick Selection Tool” icon in CS3 or later versions of Photoshop.You will use this tool to select your signature.


Hover your cursor over the signature and make sure to click on the signature itself. The wand should then select all of the pixels in your signature.
Click on “Select” and “Inverse.”, You want to paste the signature into a new document which can be saved with a transparent background.You can save an image with a transparent background in Adobe Illustrator.

, You must save the signature in a format that supports transparent backgrounds. Generally, you can save the signature as a PNG file.You should avoid saving it as a JPEG.As you save the image in PNG format, you will need to set the “background color” to “Transparent” and then click “Okay.”, Once you have saved a PNG file of your signature, you can paste it into documents. For example, you could paste it into the body of an email or insert it into a document as an image.


Once you insert the signature, move it around so that it lines up with the signature line on the contract.
You will then need to save the contract so that the signature image becomes part of the document.

, Federal law allows you to opt-out of electronic contracts and to receive a paper copy. Before using an electronic contract, the other business must get your consent. You must also be given notice that you can opt out of electronic contracts at any point in the future.However, you may have to pay additional fees for the right to use paper contracts.You should find out this information before opting out of electronic contracts.

, Not every legal document can be an electronic document. Accordingly, you should get paper copies of the following:wills, testamentary trusts, and codicils
notices of cancellation or termination of utility services
any document related to family matters, such as divorce or adoption
notices of default, repossession, foreclosure, or eviction
court documents, such as notices or court orders
notices of cancellation for life or health insurance benefits
product recalls for health and safety
documents required to travel with hazardous materials

, If you continue to use paper copies, then you will need to store them. However, you might find that you don’t have room for all of your paper copies in your office.


You can choose to scan your hard copies so that you can gain easy access to the contracts in digital form. You could then store the paper copy off-site.

This will make sure that your departments strategy will reinforce, rather than combat the corporate strategy. Be sure to address the following areas:


Company History
Company Description
Company Vision
Company Mission
Core Values
Company Goals
Financial Outlook
Strategic Business Objectives;
, Once you have a better understanding of how the company identifies itself; where it is and where it would like to be, take a moment to determine how IT fits into this model. Determine the:


IT Vision
IT Mission
IT Strategic Objectives
IT Core Values

, It is now time to take a critical look at what you are currently doing within IT in order to best make plans for the future. Break down your IT department into the following three sections and perform an assessment on each:


Organizational Infrastructure
Hardware and Software Infrastructure
Current IT Projects

, If your current state of IT is not very flattering, where would you like to see the department in the future? It is now time to be forward-thinking and proactive by analyzing internal and external factors in hopes of leveraging strengths and opportunities while mitigating weaknesses and threats. Be sure to perform the following tasks:


Understand the IT Environment (SWOT and PEST analysis)
Consider Emerging Technology Opportunities
Map Your Future- Where will you be Tomorrow if you: Do Nothing, Do XYZ
Document Your Ideal IT Situation

, Chances are your current and ideal IT situations will not completely align. Determine what requirements are needed on an operational level in order to transition from your current state of IT to your ideal. It may help to:


Determine Future IT Requirements
Identify and Summarize the Gaps

, In order to keep your team on track and manage their progress in implementing the IT Strategic Plan create a roadmap, clearly outlining all tasks that must be performed on a detailed timeline. Be sure to record:


Employee Responsibilities
Task Dependencies
Start Dates
Completion Dates

, All of your hard work will be in vain if you do not take the time to communicate the IT Strategic Plan that you have just created. Take pride in your work and share the new plan throughout the organization. IT is imperative that you revisit your IT Strategic Plan quarterly at minimum and make adjustments where applicable. Include the following in all communication:

This will need to be the same version of Windows that you currently have installed. For example, if you use Windows 7 you'll need a Windows 7 installation disc. You can either use the disc that came with your computer, or you can create one yourself. You'll need a blank DVD or a USB drive with at least 4 GB of storage:


Windows 7 - Use your product key to download the ISO file from Microsoft. Then download the Windows DVD/USB Download Tool to create an installation DVD or USB drive using the ISO file that you just downloaded.
Windows 8 - Visit the Microsoft Windows 8.1 download page and click the ""Create media"" button. Run the tool and follow the prompts to download and create an installation DVD or USB drive.Windows 10 - Visit the Windows 10 download page and click the ""Download tool now"" button. Follow the prompts in the tool to download the Windows 10 files and create an installation DVD or USB drive.;
, When you wipe your computer and reinstall Windows, all of the files on the drive will be erased. Make sure that you save any important files to another location, such as an external hard drive or a cloud storage service. Any programs that you have will need to be reinstalled after you're finished.


See How to Back Up Data for instructions on backing up your important files.

, After everything important has been backed up, you're ready to start the wipe and reinstallation process. You'll be booting your computer from the installation disc or drive instead of your hard drive. You'll need to set your computer to boot from the installation disc or drive that you just created. The process is different depending on if your computer came installed with Windows 7 or earlier or with Windows 8 or later (BIOS vs. UEFI).


Windows 7 or earlier (BIOS) - Reboot your computer and then press the BIOS, Setup, or Boot key. This key will be displayed on the screen while your computer is booting before Windows loads. Typical keys include F2, F10, F11, or Del. Open the BOOT menu and set your DVD or USB drive to be the primary boot device.
Windows 8 or later (UEFI) - Open the Start menu and right-click on the Power button. Hold down ⇧ Shift and click ""Restart."" Select ""Troubleshoot"" from the menu that appears, and then ""Advanced options."" Click the ""UEFI Firmware Settings"" button to open your UEFI menu. The Boot section of this menu will allow you to change the boot order so that your computer boots from the USB or DVD drive.

, Press any key on your keyboard when prompted to load the Windows Setup program. It may take several minutes to load all of the necessary files.

, Before installation begins, you'll be prompted to select your language preferences. Click ""Install now"" to begin the installation after making your selection.

, You'll be prompted for your Windows product key if you're installing Windows 8 or later. If you're installing Windows 7, you'll be asked for the product key after installation is complete. You can skip this step if you want to enter your product key later.

, This will allow you to delete all of the data on your computer and start fresh.

, It will be listed as a ""Primary"" drive, and will usually be labeled with your Windows version.

, This will delete the partition and remove all of the data on the partition. It will be turned into ""Unallocated space.""


You can repeat this for any other partitions that you want to remove and combine into your main one. Any data on these partitions will be deleted as well. Click ""Extend"" to combine block of unallocated space into a single partition.
You can split your partition into multiple partitions if you want. This may be useful for file organization. Select the unallocated space and click ""New"" to create new partitions from the unallocated space. Just make sure the partition you intend to install Windows on is at least 20 GB in size.

, This will begin the installation process for Windows. The copying and installation will take around 20 minutes.

, After the files have finished copying, you'll be prompted to create your user account. This account will have administrator privileges. You'll also be prompted to enter a name for the computer. This is the name that will identify your computer on the network.

, If you're installing Windows 7, you'll be prompted to enter your product key. You can skip this for now if you intend to enter your key later.

, Most users should select the ""Recommended"" options to ensure that everything stays up to date and secure.

, Your computer should automatically select the correct date and time, but you may have to make manual adjustments.

, Choose the type of network that best matches your environment. This will affect your network security and sharing settings.

, After selecting your network type, you'll be taken to the Windows desktop. If you didn't enter your product key earlier, you'll be prompted for it now.

Adjust the resolution on your TV in the Display Settings menu.",How to Use Your TV as a Second Monitor for Your Computer1," Before you can consider using a TV as a second monitor, you'll need to determine if your computer has any open ports available to connect it to. On desktops, the ports are located on the back, while laptops may have them on the back or on the sides.An open HDMI port is the most ideal, as setup for HDMI is relatively straightforward and most modern widescreen TVs support HDMI. HDMI looks like USB, but a little longer and with notched ends.
The other possible port you can use is a DVI port. This looks like a traditional parallel port with lines instead of pins on the right side. If you have a DVI but no HDMI, you can connect to your TV but you'll likely need an adapter.;
, Once you know the ports you have on your computer, you can check the ports that are available on your TV. You'll find the input ports on the back or along the side of the TV.


An open HDMI port on the TV and an HDMI port on the computer will result in the easiest connection with the highest quality.
There's a small chance that your TV will have a DVI input, which will allow you to connect to a DVI port without any adapters. Most TVs don't have this port.
You won't be able to easily connect your computer to stereo A/V (three prong) or component (five prong) inputs without multiple adapters.

, If you have matching open ports, you'll just need a regular cable to connect the two. For example, if you have an open HDMI port on your computer and your TV, just get a standard HDMI cable that will reach without straining.


If you have mismatched connectors, such as a DVI port on your computer and an HDMI port on your TV, you'll need an adapter or special cable. You can get cables that have a DVI plug on one end and an HDMI plug on the other. You can also get adapters that turn DVI ports into HDMI ports.

, HDMI cables can be simply plugged in, much like USB. DVI cables will need to be screwed in to secure them using the thumb screws on each side of the connector.


Both HDMI and DVI connectors can only be inserted one way, so don't force the connection.

, If you are connecting your computer to your TV using HDMI, you don't need any extra cables to send audio to the TV. If you're using a DVI or other connection, including DVI-to-HDMI, you'll need to use a separate audio cable to send audio from your computer to your TV.


Use a standard 3.5mm stereo cable to connect the Audio Out port on your computer to the Audio In port that matches the input you're connected to on the TV. The Audio Out port on your computer is usually green, and may have a symbol indicating that it is sending signal out.

, Use your TV's remote to turn it on and switch to the input that you connected your computer to. The inputs will usually have labels, such as ""HDMI 1.""

, This menu allows you to select which connected monitor you want to display your screen on.


If this doesn't work, open the Start menu and type ""displayswitch."" Press ↵ Enter to open the Projector menu.

, You'll have several options to pick from:


PC screen only - This is the default option where your computer's monitor is the only display.
Duplicate - This will show the same image on your computer's screen and the TV.
Extend - This will extend your desktop so that it spans both screens.
Second screen only - This will make the TV the only display.

, This will allow you to set where you want your computer's sound to be played.

, It may just say ""Digital Audio (HDMI)."" It should say ""Ready"" underneath it.

, This will make your TV the default playback device whenever it is plugged in. Any sounds your computer makes will now come out of the TV speakers.

, If you are extending your desktop so that both your monitor and the TV are being used, you can adjust the virtual positioning of the TV so that you can easily move the mouse and windows between the two. For example, if the TV is to the left of your computer, you can reposition it virtually so that when you move the cursor off the left side of your computer screen it appears on the right side of the TV screen.


Right-click on your desktop and select ""Display settings"" or ""Screen resolution.""
Click and drag the box representing your TV in the layout until it's in the position you want. If you don't know which one is your TV, click ""Identify"" and then match the number displayed on the screen.

, By default, your TV will likely automatically pick the correct resolution, especially if you connected via HDMI.


Open the Display Settings by right-clicking your desktop and selecting ""Display settings"" or ""Screen resolution."" Click ""Advanced display settings"" if you don't see the Resolution menu.
Select your TV. If you aren't sure which screen is which, click ""Identify.""
Choose the resolution from the drop-down menu. Most modern TVs display at a resolution of 1920x1080.

The ports you have will determine what you need to connect to your TV. Most Mac computers will have one of the following ports:USB-C - This port can be found on the newest Mac computers. You'll need a USB C-to-HDMI adapter, but it will transfer sound and video.
HDMI - This port can be found on many newer MacBook computers. It looks like an elongated USB port with notches on each side, and may have ""HDMI"" printed above it. This is the most ideal port, as you won't need any special adapters and HDMI transfers both video and audio.
Thunderbolt - This port is a little smaller than a USB port and will have a lightning bolt icon. Thunderbolt supports both Thunderbolt and Mini DisplayPort adapters. A Thunderbolt-to-HDMI adapter can transfer audio.
Mini DisplayPort - This port looks the same as a Thunderbolt port, but the icon is a small rectangle with a vertical line on each side. It only supports Mini DisplayPort adapters.Micro-DVI - This port is slim, and slightly larger than a USB port. It has an icon with a box with two vertical lines, much like the Mini DisplayPort. It only supports Micro-DVI adapters.

, Once you've identified the port or ports on your Mac, you'll need to see what ports are available on your TV. Ideally, you'll want to connect to an open HDMI port, especially if you have an HDMI port on your Mac as well.


If you don't have an HDMI port, look for a DVI port. This will result in the next best image quality, but will require a separate audio cable.

, If you have a Thunderbolt, Mini DisplayPort, or Micro-DVI port, you'll need an adapter that will convert the port into an HDMI port. If your Mac has an HDMI port and your TV has an HDMI port, you won't need any adapters.


If your TV has a DVI port and no HDMI port, you'll need a DVI adapter instead.

, After plugging in the adapter (if necessary), connect your Mac to your TV using an HDMI or DVI cable.

, If you're using anything other than HDMI-to-HDMI, you'll need a separate cable to connect your Mac's Audio Out port with the TV input's Audio In port. A standard 3.5mm stereo cable should work in nearly all cases. Make sure you're plugging the audio into the correct Audio In port on your TV (it should match your video input).

, Turn your TV on and use the remote to switch to the input that your Mac is connected to. The input should be labeled on the TV itself so that you can easily switch to the correct one. If your TV has multiple inputs of the same type, such as three HDMI ports, make sure you select the correct one.Typically, you'll see your desktop extended automatically onto the TV screen.

, You'll find the Apple menu in the upper-right corner of your Mac's computer screen. You'll be using these menus to adjust the orientation of your TV, as well as to choose how you want to split the display.

, This will open the display settings.

, This will allow you to adjust how your second screen is being used.

, This will make transitioning your mouse between screens much more natural. For example, If your TV is mounted above your computer, place the virtual TV screen above your computer's in the Arrangements tab.

Format the document.",How to Write a Design History File (DHF)," Write everything down, including any edits that will be made, as the revision history is important.
, It is important to justify why the device is being made as it will give the reader a little more background of the device., It is critical to have the client express what is needed in the device. This section is called the user needs. This will not only list what the user needs in their device, but also what the device intends to do., The design input is divided into two main parts, the design constraints and the design goals. These can be obtained by ranking what the client wants in the device (user needs) and what is necessary. The design constraints are what will be integrated into the device right away. The goals on the other hands are implemented if there is more time to make the device. The goals (user wants) are also called goals as they may not be needed to perform the primary function, but may serve as aesthetics or secondary features.  These will be listed and explained why they were chosen to be either goals or constraints., This shows different ideas and concepts of the device. This portion also weighs the different concepts made using Pugh matrix and morph matrix. This comparative tool allows the designer to pick the best concept. Explain why the concept was chosen., It is always great to get outside opinions about the design as it could help change what the device may look like or how it functions. Include it as it may show how it did change the device., The  design output lists all the features on the device that is intended to be made. An explanation of each is needed. Furthermore, this section will also include pictures of the design, whether it be sketches, CAD images, technical drawings or pictures of the prototype.,  The design verification is a comparison of the design inputs and outputs. This is also shown if the inputs were met by the outputs. Furthermore, it also catalogs what choices were made. An example would be - Input: Made of Aluminum Output: A specific type of Aluminum with dimensions and other information., The validation consists of records of physical tests that have been done. This shows that the device has met or will be meeting (depending if changes are made or not) its design outputs. It also shows that the device is working as intended., Every device that is made should include this. This states any precautions and how to avoid any dangers., This shows how the device has developed over time. It is always important to include this. This was also listed in step 1 as it is important to keep track of all the changes., Make sure the document is clean and has no unnecessary information on it. Include a summary page in the beginning of the document, that lists all the different parts of the document."

This is the first decisive factor which will determine whether the user will spend more time on your site or leave immediately. If your organization or business have official color scheme then incorporate that in the site design. Analyze how famous brands have done this. Keep target audience in your mind. Note how age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, and religion determine color choice.;
, Use fonts that are aligned with your brand philosophy. Apps dealing with kids and kids’ stuff can use funky fonts. Professional sites and apps need professional fonts such as Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier. Use appropriate size.

, Arrange content in a manner that guides the user in a systematic and logical way. With careful layout design, you can guide the user to a particular section where you can give important information about your product or how to buy it. Don't clutter the page. Let the text (and content) breathe!

,  Blank space isn’t as important and useful as it is in the web and app design. Cramped data in the page is a big turn off.

, Balance is an important element in visual communication. The overall layout should be balanced. View artwork for inspiration on how to balance all the elements on the page.

, Human beings communicate 70 per cent through visual cues. A picture is worth a thousand words; the adage isn’t pointless. Instead of using a thousand words use a picture. A webpage should not contain more than 400 words anyway.

, They should be easy to decipher yet interesting and creative.

, Set simplicity as the benchmark of your web and app design. Avoid using unnecessary data, text, and graphics.

Work with the tiles on the right pane of the Start Menu.,
Resize the Start Menu.,
Personalize the Start Menu.,
Configure the tiles.",How to Use the Windows 10 Start Menu," There are two ways to access the Start Menu: from the desktop or from the keyboard.


To access the Start Menu from your desktop, click or tap the Start button. The Start button is located at the bottom rightmost corner of the desktop and is represented by the Windows icon.
To access the Start Menu from the keyboard, press the Windows key on your keyboard. The Windows key is the key with the Windows logo on it and is usually located at the bottom row of your keyboard.
When you click/tap the Start button or hit the Windows key, the Start Menu pops up. You will see two panes. The left pane contains the menu-based list of folders, applications shortcuts, settings, and functions familiar to Windows 7 users. The right pane contains the finger-friendly screen full of tiles (similar to the Start Screen in Windows 8) where you can access Windows apps.;
, The left pane is divided into three general areas.


On the top is the User Account section where you can find the active user account name and picture. Click/tap on this and you can lock the screen, sign out from the account, or change the account settings.
Below the User Account section is a list of shortcuts to folders, programs, or apps that you configured to be placed on the Start Menu and those that you frequently use or have recently used. Clicking/tapping on the shortcut will open the folder or launch the application.
Below this is the shortcut to “File Explorer.” Clicking/tapping on this will open the File Explorer window.
Next is the “Settings” shortcut. Clicking/tapping on this will open the Settings menu in a different window. From the Settings menu, you can personalize your desktop, manage wired and wireless devices, set time and language, set privacy options, update Windows, among others.
Below “Settings” is the “Power” button where you can shut down, restart, or hibernate your device.
At the bottom is the “All Apps” button. Clicking/tapping on “All Apps” will expand the directory tree. All programs and apps installed in your computer will be listed in alphabetical order, and you can launch the app or program by clicking/tapping on it.

, On the right pane are “tiles” (tablet-style icons) that are shortcuts to folders or apps (usually Windows Store apps or built-in Windows apps). Clicking/tapping on a tile launches the app. Some of these tiles are “live” tiles, some are “static” tiles. Live tiles continuously display updated information from the app (weather updates, latest news, stock market movement, etc.). Static tiles are just app shortcuts.

, You can resize the Start Menu vertically by placing the mouse cursor on the top edge of the Start Menu until the cursor changes to a bi-directional vertical arrow then dragging it up or down. Similarly, you can change the width of the Start Menu by placing the cursor at the right edge of the Start Menu until it changes into a bi-directional horizontal arrow and dragging it left or right. Widening the Start Menu will extend the area for the tiles. At its narrowest, the Start Menu can fit three “medium” columns of the smaller tiles, but at its widest, six tiles can be fitted into the area.

, You can determine what is contained in the Start Menu.


Click/tap the Start button and click/tap “Settings” to open the Settings menu.
At the Settings window, click/tap “Personalization.”
At the left pane of the “Personalization” window, click “Start.” The personalization options for the Start Menu appears in the right pane.
On the right side, you can find toggle switches that you can turn on or off by clicking or tapping on it. You can choose to show or not to show the most used or recently added apps and recently opened items by clicking/tapping the toggle switch on or off.
The third toggle switch is labelled “Use Start full screen.” If turned on, the Windows 8-style Start Screen will appear when you click/tap the Start button.
At the bottom of the right pane is a link entitled “Choose which folders appear on Start.” Clicking/tapping on the link takes you to a list of folders which you can toggle on or off to determine, which are shown in the Start Menu.

Investigate local providers.,
Place your order.,
Setup a meeting and wait for installers.,
Verify that your satellite dish can point openly toward the equator.,
Verify that your satellite Internet equipment stays connected.,
Verify that you comply with the bandwidth restrictions enforced by your satellite Internet provider.,
Perform Internet activities that will not be affected by latency.",How to Use Satellite Internet," First - you have to choose the right provider for your area, because not all providers will be available in the area you're living in. You can start by simply comparing all top providers in the United States and call only the ones you like and order their services, which include installation services too.;
, Once you choose the provider - you have to call them and order your package (place order). You can do this online with most providers or call their hotline and order over phone.


You can also ask any questions that you have about the package and make sure, that you're ordering exactly what you need. So before you call and place your order - we suggest to browser for reviews of each network and learn bit more about their services, packages, pricing policy, contracts etc. You can do this by visiting a dedicated review website, where all major internet providers are being reviewed and all basic information is provider for the user.

, After you place an order - the provider will setup a date, when qualified engineers will come to your house or office and install the hardware (equipment) so you can start using your satellite internet the same day.

, Since the satellites that transmit your Internet are positioned directly over the Earth's equator, you should not have any obstructions that prevent you from having an optimal connection.


Have your satellite dish installed in an open area away from trees and similar obstructions. For example, if you live in North America, have the satellite dish installed on the southernmost tip of your roof or south of any tall trees, so it can point toward the equator.

, After your satellite dish has been installed, you can use your Internet at any time, given that the coaxial cables that connect your satellite dish to your modems stay plugged in at all times.


Check to make sure that your coaxial cables are plugged into the appropriate places on your equipment if you have issues connecting to the Internet; especially after heavy storms.

, With some providers, you may be limited to a certain amount of Internet activity within your billing cycle, which, if exceeded, can lead to temporary suspension of your Internet service or other penalties.


Consult with your satellite Internet service provider to determine how often you can use your Internet and how to keep track of your data usage.

, Since your Internet data and activity travels up to the satellites and back to your device, certain activities you perform may experience a lag time, or delay.


Refrain from streaming videos, playing time-sensitive online games, and from using voice-over internet protocol (VoIP) services, all of which will most likely be affected by latency.

The EZCTRL17 Interface Board is an easy way to break out the connections for the AllMotion EZCTRL17 stepper controller.,- EZCTRL17 Wiring Diagram- EZCTRL17 Command reference- EZ Commander software download,
- The first step to get your board up and running is to remove the fuse from the topside of the board and place it on the bottom.,
Next you want to locate the 8 position DIP switch on the bottom of the Breakout board.,
Now you are ready to connect your controller to the stepper drives.",How to Use the Allmotion Ezctrl17 Interface Board,"  You can find the hardware and software reference materials on the AllMotion website.;
,, This is a bit tricky, but if you are competent with a soldering iron and have some good solder wick, you can do it. You can also buy the controller with the fuse already moved. Once the fuse is moved, gently lay it down against the controller board. Remove all of the connectors from the top side of the board, so that just the pins are sticking up. Line up the pins on the controller with the sockets on the bottom of the Breakout board.

, This DIP switch will pull-up the STEP and DIR signals for each axis individually. The outputs from the controller are open collector, so if you need pull-ups to get a 5V signal, put the switch in the ON position. If you just want the open collector that will pull to ground when active, then put the switch in the OFF position. Here are the individual switch connections.


1 - STEP Axis 1
2 - DIR Axis 1
3 - STEP Axis 2
4 - DIR Axis 2
5 - STEP Axis 3
6 - DIR Axis 3
7 - STEP Axis 4
8 - DIR Axis 4

, There is NOT and Enable output on the controller, so if your drives need an enable, you can jumper it on your drive somehow, or you can take 5V or Ground from the breakout to make the correct signal. Then just connect your step and direction signals to the correct place on your drives.

Import Tkinter.,
Define the functions with ""def ...():"".,
Start working with Tkinter.,
Enter a few spaces (about 6) and add ""window.mainloop()"".,
Add the Tk widgets.,
Here is the completed program:





And the result:





",How to Use the Tk Toolkit with Python," If you have Python 3.x, type ""import Tkinter"", and with 2.x ""import Tkinter"". If the difference is annoying, type for example ""import Tkinter as tkinter"", if using 2.x, to only have to type tkinter, or ""from Tkinter import *"" to avoid even typing Tkinter later on. From now on you can use the last option.



 ;
, This will enable you to call functions with buttons etc.





, First add ""window=Tk()"". This defines the window you're working in.





, This will tell the program that the Tk part is over. Everything you do in Tkinter will be between the above 2 lines.





, The three basics are label, button and entry.

Label is just a ""box"" and you can change the background, text etc., in it. It is easy to add, e.g. ""lbl = Label(window, text=""Hello, World"")"". The ""lbl"" is it's name. Window is it's ""master"", the widget in which it is placed.
Buttons is the same, except that you use Button instead of Label. You can use ""command=a_def"" to execute a function if someone clicks the button.
Entry is a bit different, for you do not define the text, rather read it with ""X = .get()"". This will set X to whatever is entered into the entry. You have to, after you created the widgets, pack them with "".pack()"" Below is a small program that you can examine and learn from.

Add any new registry files that you want to import into the registry.,
Consider using System Restore as an alternative.",How to Use Regedit," Making the wrong change to the registry can cause your Windows system to become inoperable. Backing it up beforehand is a good idea; an easy way to do this is by using System Restore, a utility built-in to Windows, to create a system restore point.;
, Click on the ""Start"" button, and then click on ""Run."" In the dialog box that appears, type ""regedit"" into the text box, and then click the ""OK"" button.

, When the program launches, you will see a window divided into 2 panels. The right panel will be empty, and the left panel will show a list of 5 folders all beginning with the letters ""HKEY."" These are the 5 ""hive keys,"" or main registry keys. Clicking on the plus sign next to each folder will allow you to navigate deeper into each key.

, If you aren't sure which key you're interested in, it is best to use the Regedit help file or an online support site to determine what it is you want to do. The Windows registry is massive, and contains crucial system files that can cause serious problems if altered.

, Once you've navigated to the right key in the left-hand panel, right click on it. A context menu will appear with several options.


Click on ""New"" to add a new key underneath the key you have selected.
Click on ""Delete"" to delete the key. If the selected key is associated with a program that you have uninstalled, you can safely delete the key.
Click on ""Export"" to save all the information contained in the selected key on your hard drive. This is a good way to back up an individual key before making any changes to it.

, Registry keys are saved using the .reg extension, which is really just a plain text file. This is helpful if you are trying to add information to the registry from an online source that is presented as text. Copy the text into a text editor (like Notepad), and save the file with the .reg extension. Once you've saved the file, simply double-click on it to add it to the registry.

, If you are using Regedit to attempt to fix a major problem with your operating system, remember that System Restore automatically creates restore points at regular intervals. You can easily choose to restore your system's configuration to a date before the problem arose, and that will restore the registry in the process.

Route 53 can be used as an authoritative DNS for your domains and subdomains. This means that anybody who wants to look up your domain must get it from Route 53 either directly or indirectly.
The IP address that Route 53 returns for a domain to a client is computed based on the client's IP address and the Route 53 record sets and policies configured by you.
The routing policy used by Route 53 can take into account the health of the endpoints in various ways (TCP health checks, HTTP status endpoint health checks with string matching).
Route 53 follows a ""principle of constant work"": the amount of work done by Route 53 is independent of the health of the endpoints being checked. This is to avoid the problem of ""cascading failures"" introduced by Route 53 actions. This does not preclude the possibility of Route 53 health checks indirectly leading to cascading failures due to traffic redirection; however, Route 53 itself remains robust.Route 53 record sets have their own Time To Live (TTL) that can be set to 60 seconds or more. Any client or intermediate DNS resolver is supposed to respect this TTL: if it has not refreshed the resolution of the domain or subdomain for the duration of the TTL or longer, then it must refresh the information. The shorter the TTL, the greater the frequency of Route 53 lookups and the greater the cost of using the service. In practice, these costs are negligible until you get to millions of hits, and generally the advantages of shorter TTLs overwhelm the disadvantages at this scale because of the speed with which you can make and fix changes to the way global traffic flows.;
, It can therefore by used for dynamic and responsive IP addressing.

Route 53 has edge locations around the world. It determines availability and latency from each of these edge locations to each of the Amazon Web Services regions.
In addition, Route 53 runs each health check independently from each of the edge locations. You can view, for each health check, the history of recent health check activity, including both the health checker IP, the IP that the health check resolved to, and whether the health check was successful.
When a client does a lookup for a domain or subdomain in Route 53, it combines three pieces of information: (a) the client's IP address, (b) the most recent availability, latency, and health check information, and (c) the record sets and routing policies configured, to respond. Since the health check frequency is 10-30 seconds (depending on the setting) and the minimum TTL is 60 seconds, the minimum time for health check-based changes to propagate is 90-150 seconds, and the minimum time for other changes to propagate is 60 seconds.

,

Route 53 is only used by clients to look up IP addresses. The actual requests are not routed through Route 53.
Even for IP address lookup, not all clients touch Route 53 directly. There is caching at the level of individual browsers: a browser will cache the IP addresses locally for the duration of the TTL. There may also be caching at an intermediate level. For instance, if two different users using the same ISP in the same region look up the same address within a time difference of each other that is less than the TTL, the second user may get the address cached by the ISP's DNS resolver from the first user's request, rather than going all the way to Route 53, the authoritative DNS server.
Therefore, the count of requests to Route 53 does not provide a good estimate of actual traffic to the IP addresses looked up.

, Conversely, its competitors can be hosted with AWS-hosted architecture.

The biggest competitors to Route 53 include UltraDNS, Dyn, Cotendo, easyDNS, and DNS Made Easy. Route 53 has approximately comparable availability as competitors but slightly faster propagation latency and slightly lower cost.With that said, Amazon.com itself does not use Route 53, which might be reason to be a little skeptical about its reliability for very-high-end deployments.Route 53 as well as its competitors can be used for servers hosted on Amazon infrastructure (i.e., EC2) as well as for servers hosted elsewhere.
Route 53 has better hooks into EC2 (for instance, it can point to ELBs and evaluate their health quickly) and so makes particular sense to use when dealing with EC2. It also has good programmatic access and health checks.

,

For instance, if you want to balance incoming traffic across three servers, you can set a Route 53 A record with the IP addresses of all the servers. You can also set up multiple Route 53 A records with different weights, using a weighted routing policy (discussed later on this page).
Conversely, you can use a load balancer to receive incoming traffic and then use that load balancer to forward the traffic to the different servers.

,

Since traffic does not actually go through any central point, Route 53 can be used to redistribute traffic across regions without adding round-trip time to latency. With a load balancer, the round-trip time between the load balancer and the server that finally processes the request gets added to the end-user's latency. For instance, if we want to make sure that people in Europe get served by servers in Europe while people in East Asia get served by servers in East Asia (for minimal latency) routing traffic through a load balancer defeats the purpose because of the added round-trip time. However, we can use Route 53 records for this purpose without adding to latency, because the Route 53 records are resolved locally without making a trip to a central server. Moreover, due to caching (up to the TTL) of the lookups, even that local resolution has to be done only once a minute.
Route 53 is also correspondingly more robust to downtime, because it has a large number of edge locations that respond to requests, and has been designed based on the principle of constant work to avoid cascading failure.
Route 53-based routing has the advantage over Amazon's Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in that it can scale very quickly to large loads, whereas ELBs cannot handle very rapid and large variations in load quickly enough. Note that ELB is good enough for most use cases, but, for instance, logging company Loggly has found that Route 53 served its use case better. Note that Loggly is unusual relative to most web or API services that have a more steady or predictable load. Its reference class is ""emergency management"" which combines unpredictability with very quick changes in load at some times.,

Route 53 cannot be used to get a bird's eye view of the total traffic.
Route 53 is not good at distributing traffic equally across servers. This is because although it allows for a round robin IP lookup strategy, this is only for IP lookups and _not_ for the actual requests. Therefore, if the distribution of request sources is not totally uniform, then the distribution of traffic can also be corresponding non-uniform. This is particularly important if you are offering an API service for a small number of clients with high load per client.
Route 53 cannot distribute traffic equitably the way load balancers can. For instance, Amazon's Elastic Load Balancer uses the leastconns algorithm: it forwards a request to the server with the least number of outstanding requests. This helps reduce traffic load on slower or more unresponsive servers. This is not possible in Route 53 since traffic does not even flow through it, and it has no awareness of the response times of individual servers.
Servers cannot be added to or removed from Route 53 as quickly as they can with a load balancer. Route 53 also cannot be integrated directly into the autoscaling that AWS offers, though it is possible to write scripts that both create new servers and add records to them using the Route 53 API based on the traffic load currently being experienced, as logging company Loggly has done.

,

Load balancing is best suited for distributing traffic equitably, and maintaining high availability, within a region.
Route 53 is best suited for guaranteeing availability across regions, minimizing latency, and handling cross-region redundancy and failover.

,

In fact, Route 53 and Amazon CloudFront (Amazon's CDN-like service) service share edge locations.

,

The goal of a CDN is to directly respond to a query for a (typically static) resource by serving that resource, without hitting the original server or file system that stores the resource. The CDN refreshes the resource from the source (server or filesystem) either periodically or when the resource is explicitly purged.
The goal of Route 53 and other managed DNS services is to respond to DNS lookup queries only and not to serve actual content.
You can use a CDN to offer low round-trip times around the world to all users (bounded by the round-trip time to the closest edge location), but Route 53 does not do this.

, Route 53 does not offer this., A public hosted zone is a container for all the record sets associated with a web domain and its subdomains.Each public hosted zone has one NS (Name Server) record that specifies the four Amazon nameservers to use to resolve the domain and its subdomains. This set of four nameservers is called a delegation set. To migrate the DNS records to Amazon Route 53, you need to update the list of four nameservers with the registrar (where you have registered the domain) to this set of four nameservers. This list can take 24-48 hours to update globally.
Each public hosted zone also has one SOA (Start of Authority) record that provides authoritative information about the domain, including the primary nameserver, the email of the domain administrator, the domain serial number, and timers related to refreshing the zone.
The delegation set is generally different for different public hosted zones. However, it is possible to use the Route 53 API to have the same delegation set be used for different public hosted zones. This helps make it easy to migrate hosting for a large number of websites since many registrars allow users to specify a default set of nameservers to use across all their domains.

, The individual items in each hosted zone are called record sets. These correspond to DNS records, but with some additional settings.

Each record set has a set of addresses that the subdomain may resolve to. These addresses could be IP addresses (that may or may not be EC2 instances) or DNS names (such as for an EC2 ELB, S3 bucket configured as a static site, or CloudFront distribution). Note that when we use DNS names, the DNS name in turn may resolve to one or more IP addresses. For instance, an EC2 ELB will generally resolve to multiple IP addresses, with the number of IP addresses depending on the number of availability zones it is operational in, as well as the traffic load it is handling.
Each record set is associated with the domain or a subdomain of the domain associated with the hosted zone, and plays a role in resolving that domain. In general, it is possible (and crucial) to have multiple record sets (each of which may in turn have multiple records) for a single subdomain.
Each record set has a record type. The record types are a subset of the types of DNS records. The most important record types for ordinary use cases are Address records (A records) and Canonical Name records (CNAME records). The CNAME makes sense when you are simply rewriting one subdomain to another. The A record is much more versatile.
When using a record that points directly to the IP address of an EC2 instance, make sure that the IP address is an elastic IP so that it survives the termination of the instance and can be reattached to a new instance.When using an A or CNAME record for an Elastic Load Balancer, CloudFront distribution, S3 bucket configured as a static site, or Route 53 record, it is possible to set it as an Alias. An Alias record simply remaps the subdomain to the DNS name it is aliased to, and therefore changes to the latter are automatically picked by the former. This allows A records to have some of the benefits of CNAME records while still allowing for multiple records per subdomain. It also allows for deeper integration with the underlying resources, including a direct evaluation of the target health without setting up separate health checks. The idea of the alias record was introduced by DNSimple (not affiliated with Amazon Route 53).Amazon's implementation differs somewhat from DNSimple's.Amazon offers a guide on the use of Alias versus Non-Alias Resource Record Sets.In the case of multiple record sets for a given subdomain, and the full picture of how DNS lookups for that subdomain will resolve depends on all the record sets and their interaction., Some types of record sets support health checks and evaluation of target health.

For any record type (alias or not, and regardless of record type) with a policy other than ""Simple"" (the record types are discussed in the next part) you can associate a health check. This can ping a specific endpoint (with a port you can specify) using the HTTP protocol (other protocols are not supported) and look for a specific search string in the response. The request interval can be set to either 10 seconds or 30 seconds. The timeout limit for response, the length of initial segment of response that will be matched against the search string, and the fraction of health checks that need to pass for the endpoint to be considered healthy are all controlled by Amazon and not user-configurable.
The ""Evaluate Target Health"" option is available for alias records (CNAME or A records) regardless of the policy. Since this option is offered only for specific Amazon resources, it can benefit from deep integration with the underlying resources. For instance, in the special case of Alias records (CNAME or A records) that point to Amazon EC2 ELBs, the target health evaluation passes if and only if the ELB has at least one instance that is registered and in service.This is a special behind-the-scenes deep integration between the two AWS services (Route 53 and ELB).

, The simplest routing policy is a ""simple"" routing policy. This is for cases where there is only one record set associated with the subdomain. A simple routing policy can include multiple IP or DNS addresses, and will resolve to each of them an equal fraction of the time. Specifically, it follows a round robin strategy. Simple routing policies pair well with CNAME records. As always, use an Alias record if pointing to an EC2 DNS address such as an Elastic Load Balancer, and evaluate the target health., Another commonly used routing policy is a ""weighted"" routing policy. Here, each record set associated with a subdomain gets a weight. Within the record set, all individual IP addresses are resolved using a round robin strategy. Across the record sets, the probability of a given record set being used is the ratio of the weight of the record set to the sum of weights of all record sets for the subdomain. For instance, if there are record sets of weights 3, 2, 2, and 1 respectively for a subdomain, they are selected with probabilities of 3/8, 2/8, 2/8, and 1/8 respectively.

Weighted routing policies make sense only in case of multiple record sets, all using the weighted routing policy.
Typically, for a weighted routing policy, we only specify one IP address or DNS A record per record set, and therefore create as many record sets as the number of IP addresses or DNS A records.
Note that the numerical weight associated with a record set in a weighted routing policy does not give a full picture of the probability of that record set being used: we also need to know the denominator (the sum of weights across all record sets). In particular, if we add a new record set, the probability of resolving to each of the other record sets goes down in the same proportion. Similarly, if the weight on one of the record sets is altered, this affects the probability for all the other record sets.

, Latency-based routing (LBR) is one of the more sophisticated routing policies. Each latency record specifies an Amazon Web Services region.

The latency-based router, when asked to resolve the subdomain, looks at its periodically refreshed table of the latency between the following areas: its edge location closest to the IP address doing the lookup, and the Amazon Web Services region specified in the record set.
Note that it is not logically entailed that the records in the record set are located in the AWS region specified for latency-based routing. In fact, your records may not be on AWS infrastructure at all! If they are on AWS infrastructure, it makes sense to use the AWS region they are in. Otherwise, it makes sense to use the closest AWS region, to offer the best proxy for latency to those records.Similar to the case of weighted records, latency-based record sets make sense only when there is more than one of them. In this case, the latency for each record set is calculated as explained above (by a table lookup of latency between the closest edge location to the requester and the AWS region specified in the record set). Then, the record set with the lowest reported latency is returned.
Note, in particular, that this estimate of latency may be very different from the actual latency of queries, for two reasons: it uses latency from edge locations to the AWS region rather than from the actual client to the actual server, and second, it ignores the processing time on the servers itself, which could vary between regions.
In particular, unlike the leastconns load balancer used by Amazon's ELBs, that adaptively redistributes traffic based on latency differences, Route 53 does not take into account any information about actual query latency. We might ideally imagine that if one region is slower than another, the other region will pick up a larger share of traffic from geographical locations somewhere in the middle of the two. Latency-based routing does not do this.
The latency-based routing algorithm has been known to fail, in that it sometimes routes traffic to an incorrect location.Therefore, if latency is truly important to you and you have a small set of customers who heavily use your API, it's better to give them subdomains that directly resolve to particular regions rather than use LBR hoping that they will be routed correctly.

, This is similar to latency-based routing, but allows explicit specification of what geographical locations should get mapped to what record sets., AWS Route 53 offers both active and passive failover based on health checks and direct evaluation of target health, all of which operate on the principle of constant work to avoid cascading failure.If you associate health checks with your Route 53 record sets, then a particular record set is taken out of commission after failing three successive health checks (the number of failures may be configurable). Similarly, if you are evaluating target health of the ELB, a record set is taken out of commission once the target proves unhealthy. The record sets come back live once the health check or target health return to normal. The maximum time for the effect to be global is 150 seconds: 3 30-second failed checks, plus 60-second TTL (note that the TTL is configurable and if you set it to longer then it will take more time for the change to propagate).
For weighted routing policies, this means that the weights on the still-healthy record sets increase proportionately.
For latency-based routing policies, this means that if a record set goes down entirely, all the traffic that would have been routed there is instead routed to the next-lowest-latency region for that particular part of traffic. Therefore, the load for the other regions will not increase in the same proportion, but rather it will increase based on their proximity to the traffic that was served by the now-down region. This can lead to a cascading failure. For instance, say you have three regions: us-west-1, us-east-1, and eu-west-1, with one record set for each, and you have configured capacity to handle typical traffic loads for each region. Now, suppose us-east-1 goes down. In this case, almost all the traffic for us-east-1 will go to us-west-1, the closest region for most of the traffic that would go to us-east-1. This could be a significant traffic increase for us-west-1, and the increased load could cause the region to collapse. Now, all global traffic hits eu-west-1, which might cause that region to collapse. The upshot is that passive failover can actually cause a global collapse without careful design. The problem is more acute than with weighted routing policies because of how a lot of the rerouted traffic goes to one region.
It is also possible to have record sets explicitly designated as failover. These record sets are used only if all the other record sets go out of commission. We can use these to serve static backups.

, It can be hard to switch record type, aliasing, and routing policies in the Route 53 console.

For instance, there are constraints on the record sets for a particular subdomain: we cannot mix weighted and latency-based records, and we cannot have more than one simple record.
One way out of this challenge is to start with a tree structure of records to begin with, allowing for the creation of a new branch of the tree. Amazon offers guides on complex DNS configuration.Using the Route 53 API gives more flexibility with making changes than using the console since more complex changes can be made more quickly, minimizing downtime during tricky changes between configurations.

,

Invest at least a few hours in making sure that your Route 53 policies are set reasonably.
Investigate the use of traffic policies and traffic flow that allow you to store complex configurations. In the long run, clicking around in the console to modify policies is not a good idea for a key ingredient to your availability.
Investigate incorporating updates to the Route 53 API in your deployment scripts (such as Ansible or Chef scripts).

, As mentioned earlier, if latency is particularly important for a customer, or if for some other reason you want a particular customer to only hit your API endpoint in a particular region, it is better to give them a subdomain for which you have configured records only for that region, rather than rely on latency-based or geolocation-based routing. These don't usually fail, but when they do, you are helpless.,

One often-underappreciated aspect of latency-based routing is that you can use it to route traffic to a region that is not the closest region.
One way you can use this is as follows. Suppose you have two chances to query the backend server. Most of the times, the server responds correctly in the first chance. However, if it fails, this could be due to region-specific issues (such as servers in the region being overloaded, or connectivity problems with the region). You therefore want the first query to be to the geographically closest region, but the second query to be to a different region that is not geographically closest but (hopefully) second closest.
You can do this by having two subdomains, one for your first choice, and one for your second choice. The Route 53 records for the first subdomain simply use latency-based routing as defined by default (i.e., you create one record set for this subdomain and each active region, routing traffic closest to that region to the servers in that region). The Route 53 records for the second subdomain use latency-based routing, but send traffic closest to one region to a different region. This guarantees that your two chances are used up against different regions.
Note that this is not a substitute for health checks and target health evaluations, but it does address cases where a region is somewhat overloaded but still largely healthy. It also avoids the problem of cascading failure, where a region with a high failure rate may end up getting additional traffic due to second tries.

,

whois can look up authoritative registration information for domains.
nslookup can be used to get information about the nameservers.dig (the most useful command for Route 53 debugging) can find the IP addresses associated with a given subdomain, and you can verify that the results returned conform with your routing policy. It also prints the remaining TTL. When you issue the first command, this should be your full TTL. Subsequent invocations within the TTL should show the remaining TTL. For instance, if your TTL is 60 seconds, then running dig after 15 seconds should show a TTL of 45 seconds. If DNS name A has latency-based alias records pointing to DNS name B and DNS name C, you can dig all three names, and then see if the IP addresses that A resolves to matches the IP addresses that B and C resolve to. You can also specify a +trace option to dig to print the trace.traceroute is also useful to get clearer information on how the resolution occurred.
ping can be used to query the DNS address and get estimates of the round-trip time.
curl or wget can be used to make a HTTP request and get a response.
You may run these shell commands from your own machine or by logging in to remote servers in various locations.

Set up the soldering station.,
Choose a tip.,
Select a temperature.,
""Tin"" the soldering tip.,
Solder as usual.",How to Use a Soldering Station," Clear and fire-proof the immediate work area, assemble the components, dampen the sponge, plug in the unit, and put on your safety glasses.;
, Most soldering stations have interchangeable tips (which are also replaceable, but by avoiding overheating, the station's temperature control minimizes corrosion). The tip should be broad enough to cover the width of the joint, but no wider to avoid heating the wrong thing. A small round tip will do well for general use. Assemble and secure it onto the iron (handheld assembly).

, The temperature should be as high as needed to heat the work rapidly - within a second or so - to the point where it can melt additional solder onto itself, but not much hotter. Too cool, and still intense heat will have time to work itself up leads into delicate components; too hot, and, similarly, excess heat will work its way into components as your dexterity, rather than iron temperature, limits the speed at which you can remove the iron. 600 degrees F is a starting point for ""surface mount"" components that sit in little blobs of solder in circuit boards; 700 degrees for smallish components and thin wires; and 800 or so for largish components and lamp-cord-size wires.

, Before you start, and every several minutes afterward (especially as the soldering iron seems to become less effective), apply a small amount of fresh (and flux-cored, as usual) solder to the tip where it will contact the work, sufficient to coat the end with fresh, soft, silvery metal. Wipe off any excess that hangs down against the damp sponge in the iron rest. Before soldering each joint that doesn't have some solder on it already, apply just a little solder to the iron to provide a wider, squishy contact to dump heat into the joint. The purpose is not to add much of the solder from the iron to the work--a recipe for unreliable, unwetted ""cold soldered"" joints--but simply to efficiently heat the work by a sizable surface rather than a point so that it can accept solder well itself.

, But better!

Figure out if you need an external microphone.,
Use a built-in microphone in your PC, if your PC is installed with one.,
Develop a list of items the microphone could be used with.,
Find another suitable place on your PC for an external microphone to be plugged in.,
Plug your microphone into the microphone jack.,
Use it with your daily needs.

,
Enunciate properly.,
Speak up.,
Talk at a medium pace.,
Know what you are going to say.,
Breathe often and in a natural rhythm.,
Avoid using cases of bad grammar, slang, and swear words.,
Use language that everyone will understand.",How to Use a Microphone on a PC," Sometimes, it's text that gets the word across easier than if you talk. However, there are other times when talking gets the word across better than text-alone.;
, Much like talking into a camera-microphone or telephone receiver, you can record sounds from your voice just by talking into it.

, Perhaps you'd like to make a call or maybe to even produce your own custom sounds, a microphone on a PC is crucial.

, Sometimes, a PC won't come with a microphone built-in. Microphones have become second-nature to be purchasable at a PC store offline, and knowing whether or not you can plug one in, is a major deal. See and identify if you have a place for your microphone to plug in.


On laptops, If you have one, you will know. This circular plug in will be on one of the sides of the laptop. If it doesn't have these circular plug-ins, look for an empty USB plug. USB plug-in microphones are becoming popular, as more and more people convert to using more and more mobile devices.

Don't get confused, if your laptop has two circular plug-in locations. Most laptops have two, one of them being for use with external headphones.


On a desktop computer, the jack would be somewhere on a panel of the computer system (not the monitor). Again, this may be near where a USB or headphones jack would be.
The microphone jack looks pretty much identical to the headphones jack. Don't get confused, though: they are two completely different things. The headphones jack transports sound out of your computer into the headphones. The microphone jack transports sound from the microphone into the computer.

, It's just like inserting headphones into your computer, or maybe your phone or MP3 player.

,, Mumbling people can't be well understood, and the video-watcher might even stop watching your video. Pronounce the words clearly and correctly. If you're not sure how to say a word, either look it up or don't say it at all.

, People are only willing to turn up the volume so much. Record a ten second video of you talking at your normal volume and listen to it at your preferred video volume. If you must turn the volume up on your device, you have to speak up a bit. If you need to turn it down, turn your talking volume down in turn too.

, If you talk too fast, no one will understand you. If you talk too slow, the conversation will sound dry or boring, and your videos may even then become too long. Find a happy medium! Think of the person you are talking to, as being a complete stranger. Don't think about the camera as being a friend, even though you may or may not know when or how you bought this camera.

, If you have no idea what you're even talking about, issues may arise. Stuttering or pausing, or even rambling often are good signs that people can honestly know that you don't know what to say. Make up and bring a bulleted list of topics to talk about with you when you walk up to the podium to talk about your topic.

, If you're saying everything in one breath or talking too many breaths, your voice will sound weird.

, They are a big ""turn off"" to the watcher. No one wants to listen to 'She's not coming to my party because she's the most annoying person I met!"" Would you listen to that for five minutes? Make your topics something a person's whole family can enjoy.

, Unless huge words and/or slang are necessary in the video, avoid using them

, Turn the laminating machine on so that it can warm up. The specific directions that come with your laminator should tell how long to preheat the machine. Most machines have a light that signals when the machine is turned on and another light that signals when the machine is ready to laminate.

, You will want to cut and trim the item to be laminated to look exactly as you wish it to look once the plastic has been fused into place.

, Push it right up next to the rolls of film, so that the machine can grab hold of the paper easily.

, The laminator will begin to pull the paper into the machine.

You're working with delicate electronic parts, and you may be carrying a static charge. Remove this possibility by touching something metal.
The cards are held in place by a pair of clips; they are located at the edges of each card.
Gently slide the two clips away from the card you're removing.

,


Once clear of the clips, the card will rise away from the device at an angle. It is now loose and may be pulled away from it's holder.
Repeat the same steps to remove the second RAM card.

First, check that both cards are fully installed. The clips can sometimes engage even when the card isn't fully in place.
Second, reinstall the original RAM cards. We know they worked before removing them.
If they work once they're reinstalled, than you know the new cards are likely damaged.
If they fail once they're reinstalled, there is likely a larger problem at hand. If this is the case, its best to take the matter to a professional.

Pick the right moment.,
Avoid accusations.,
Express the fact that you identify with their fascination.,
Tell them how it makes you feel.",How to Talk to Your Partner About Their Smartphone Obsession1," When bringing up the problem, you need to pick the right moment so you have enough time to have a real discussion. If you pick the wrong moment, your discussion may be rushed, incomplete, or come across as hostile.


Initiate the conversation when you are together. Do not initiate it by text or over the phone.
Consider a quiet moment when you have some time to talk. For instance, avoid initiating the conversation in the morning when both of you are getting ready for work.
Try not to pick a moment when the person is using their smart phone. If you do, they may see it as an attack. At the same time, they might be doing something useful (or work related).;
, When you start your conversation, don’t start off with a blanket statement of what you think they are doing. By simply stating “you are addicted to your smart phone,” you’ll set a negative tone for the discussion and might even close them off to listening to your concerns.


Use words that moderate your tone. For instance, say “I feel” or “It seems” or “I think”
Never make definitive statements like “You use your smart phone too much.”, It might help to share the fact that you understand why they love playing with their phone all the time. By sharing this, you’ll put your partner at ease and let them know that you understand their position.


Share the fact that you love your own phone. For example, say, “I’m really into my phone, too. I just think it is so easy to overuse the phone.”
Tell them that their phone is really cool. Say “John, your phone really is awesome. It can do so much.”
Explain that you, at times, have struggled with your phone usage, too. Say for example, “Daryl, when I got my new phone, I was obsessed with it, too.”
Let them know they’re not the only one obsessed with their smart phone – many people are., Perhaps the most important thing is to share exactly how their phone obsession makes you feel. Without sharing this, your partner won’t really understand why you’ve initiated this conversation.


Tell them you feel like they ignore you. For example, say “John, it hurts my feelings when you focus on your phone and ignore me.”
Let them know you are frustrated. For instance, say “Sarah, I get so frustrated when I’m talking to you but you don’t listen to what I’m saying because you’re playing with your phone.”"
"
Be polite.,
Watch your body language.,
Avoid getting emotional.,
Listen to what your partner says.,
Compromise with your partner.",How to Talk to Your Partner About Their Smartphone Obsession2," When talking to your partner about their smart phone addiction, you need to be polite. If you’re not polite, they won’t take your concern to heart and may just get angry at you.


Let them know you are appreciative that they are listening you and taking your concerns seriously. For instance, start off by saying “George, I really appreciate you listening to my concerns.”
Avoid calling your partner names.
Don’t use curse words or vulgarities., When talking to your partner, make sure you have positive body language. If you don’t have positive body language, you’ll send nonverbal signals that you are angry or upset with their behavior.


Don’t cross your arms in a defensive posture.
Try to smile.
Use a relaxed posture., Perhaps the most important thing in communicating effectively is to stop yourself from getting emotional. If you get emotional, you may not be able to properly articulate the reasons why you are upset with their phone usage. In addition, you may wind up inadvertently escalating the conversation into an argument.


If your partner says something that angers you, breathe deeply. For instance, they might blow off your concerns. Instead of getting emotional, talk to them about it later.
Stay focused on what you want to say to your partner.
Use humor, if you can possible. Joke and say, “are you going to marry your phone?”, While you want to be able to articulate your perspective, you also need to listen to how your partner responds to you. Without listening, you won't be able to get a fuller understanding of the situation.


Don't talk when your partner is responding to you.
Let your partner know you are listening. For instance, say ""I know you might see this differently. I'm happy to hear you out.""
If your partner has a good argument about how their smartphone is necessary for work, listen to them.
Avoid thinking about your response as your partner is talking. If you're thinking about what you'll say next, you won't be able to internalize what they are saying., In the end, you'll want to reach some sort of agreement with your partner. By reaching a compromise, you'll feel better about the relationship and your partner won't have to completely change their phone usage. Some compromises might include:


Your partner won't use the phone during meals or family time.
Your partner won't use the phone when you are talking to each other.
Your partner might lower their data plan."
"
Think about the problem.,
List things to tell your partner.,
Reflect on your own cellphone habits.",How to Talk to Your Partner About Their Smartphone Obsession3," Before you talk to them about their obsession, you’ll need to ponder the issue. Without thinking about the problem, you won’t be able to properly articulate your concerns to your partner.


Ask yourself why their phone obsession bothers you. For instance, ask yourself whether their phone obsession is a temporary thing or does it represent a larger problem in your relationship.
Think about whether your relationship has had more problems since your partner got their smart phone or if those problems existed before.
Consider if they are really obsessed with their phone. For instance, think about whether they are wasting time playing with their phone or if they are doing work-related activities., By listing the reasons, you’ll get yourself ready for talking to your partner about their phone obsession. Some problems might be:


They play with their phone rather than listening to you. Thus, conversations with your partner seem one-sided.
Your partner is unable to fulfill their obligations like work and chores because they spend too much time fiddling on their phone.
The person neglects paying attention to and loving pets and children because they play with their phone.
Your partner spends a lot of money on smart phone games, apps, or in-app purchases., Before talking to your partner about their phone usage, you need to think carefully about your own habits. Ultimately, you shouldn’t approach your partner about their phone usage if you engage in the same behavior.


Spend some time, days or even a few weeks, considering your own usage. Try to note if you use your smart phone during mealtime, while others are talking to you, or during other important events.
Ask close friends or family what they think of your usage. For instance, ask your best friend “Do you think I’m obsessed with my smart phone?”
Track your data usage. If you use a lot of data, or as much data as your partner, you may have similar usage patterns as them."

Find ways to protect it.,
Keep it clean.,
Buy a protection plan.,
To keep your screen and the rest of the device clean and shiny, you're going to have to get a cleaning set for your electronic buddy.",How to Take Care of an Electronic Device," Most devices can break in many ways. Getting a case is a good first step toward taking good care of your electronic device. You can find a wide variety of cases on different websites. I really recommend amazon.com for your case shopping. It is a great site; has everything you need for electronics, including cases. Don't rush, do some research, or you might end up getting a case of the wrong phone brand, or with bad quality. And shipping it back isn't easy.;
, One of the most important things in protecting your device is keeping it away from unpleasant threats. Keep it away from pets, (cat urine never washes off), little siblings, and water/food. If you happen to spill water on it, there is a fast remedy to save your digital friend. If you are close to the kitchen when you spill something on your device, immediately get a bag of uncooked rice, (white rice works better) and submerge your device in it. The rice will extract the water, hopefully before the water can do any damage. After about ten minutes, take it out and try using it. The only problem is how to dunk a laptop in a tiny bag of rice. 

, If an expensive device is in the hands of a young or old user, you might want to consider getting a protection plan. The plan is about 20 or 30 dollars, so if you break it, the company will ship you a new one or fix the fixable parts for free.

, Cleaning sets are usually cheap; around 10 bucks. The kit usually includes a cleaning rag (made of special materials) and a bottle of chemicals to spray on your screen. DO NOT USE REGULAR WATER AND A PAPER TOWEL! Also, if you're screen constantly gets smudged, you might want to think about buying a screen protector. These are very handy, and cost about as much as the cleaning kit. It might change the feel of your screen, (especially in iPhones and iPods) but it protects your screen from dirt, bugs and smudges. If you follow these steps, you will have an electronic device in great condition, just like you got it out of the box.

Screw the back panel in place and boot your laptop after putting the battery back in if you removed it and/or putting the power cable back into the wall.",How to Upgrade from an Nvidia Geforce Graphics Card in an Asus Laptop," Once you've turned it completely off, make sure to unplug the laptop from the wall, if it is connected. If possible, make sure to also take out the battery from the laptop, just to be safe. You don't want to be messing around with expensive electronics only to have your laptop start up and short circuit.;
, Most laptops have Phillips screw heads for the outer panel, but yours might be different depending on the manufacturer of the laptop.

, Make sure not to strip the screws, as you'll need those to put the cover(s) back on again. This is where you will find the ""Guts"" of your laptop.


There will be a silver casing surrounding a large part of the circuits inside. Do not touch this. It is the bare bones of the laptop and contains BIOS chips and default ram. The exposed part is what you will be looking at. The graphics card is a large chip that is coming out of the side of the casing. You will want to unscrew the card from the outside. (Screws vary with laptop)

, Write down or take a picture of which wires connect to which parts of the card. Remove these wires and put the old graphics card aside.

, Screw everything back in place.

Discourage the senders from sending more faxes by annoying them.,
Turn off your fax machine.",How to Stop Unwanted Faxes," In the United States, the 2005 Junk Fax Prevention Act requires all fax marketers to provide a way for receivers to opt out of future faxes.

In some cases, calling an opt-out number will not work. This typically occurs when the fax marketers are deliberately breaking or ignoring the law.;
, Consult your fax machine's user manual and search for a way to block incoming numbers.


Look around on the fax to see if the sender included his sending fax number. If the sending number is not included on the fax, then you can use the *57 method to trace unwanted calls. However, you will first need to set up the *57 service with your service provider and there will be limitations on tracing the number, such as only tracing numbers in your local service area.

You can send complaints to the FCC by phone call, by email, by fax, by written letter, or by using the FCC online complaint form.

, Fax-to-email software automatically converts all received faxes into emails that are forwarded to your email address. By using such software, you can delete junk faxes and only print out the faxes that are important. If your main concern with junk fax is the waste of paper and ink, this can be a great solution.

, One common method of discouraging fax spammers is to fax a few sheets of black construction paper to the fax number that spammed you. This will quickly use a lot of their toner, forcing their machine to shut down until the toner is replaced.


Unfortunately, this method will have no effect if the fax spammer is using fax-to-email software. If they are, they will simply see black emails in their inbox.

, As a last resort, a temporary solution to the issue of junk fax is to simply turn off your fax machine when you aren't expecting any faxes.

Recognize that social development starts at birth.,
Show your child that you love them.,
Embrace your child with support and security.,
Allow your baby to interact with multiple people of different ages.,
Arrange “play dates” at a young age.",How to Support Social Development in Young Children1," Many people think that social development starts around the time that children enter school, because that is when they are interacting with other children the most. Although this is when they begin ""using"" social skills, social development actually starts much earlier. In fact, it starts during infancy.;
, Lots of pats, hugs, nice words, praise and encouragement let your child feel special and loved. When you satisfy their need for love, they learn, through example, how to love others and to return love and attention.

, Young children are totally dependent on you. When frightened or insecure, they will shrink back to you and ask for protection. Respond to this need and offer them protection so they learn to trust you and develop faith in other people.

, A parent can support the development of strong social skills by allowing interaction with multiple people of different ages. Although the baby may seem too young to be aware of the differences, they are actually very sensitive to the smell and touch of the people that hold them.


Allowing your baby to stay with a family member or babysitter for a few hours at a time will help them learn that there are other people they can rely on aside from their immediate family.
This early support will also help lessen the separation anxiety that children usually go through when they are a little older.

, Another way to support social development in an infant is to arrange play dates even before they are able to crawl or sit up. This is as simple as putting two non-sibling babies near each other for “tummy time” on a blanket on the floor. Although very young children do not seem to interact or play with each other, they are aware that the other child is nearby and are actually in the beginning stages of developing empathy, a very important social skill.


Often, if one baby is cooing and happy, the other baby will seem to copy this. The same is true if one baby is fussy and crying.
Parents can also support the development of empathy by copying the baby’s emotions, cooing in response to the baby’s cooing or acting sad when the baby is sad.
It does not really matter whether the children are facing each other or not.

Continue involving your toddler in social situations.,
Encourage sharing with friends and family.,
Teach your toddler simple negotiation or remove a contested object.,
Recognize aggressive behavior.",How to Support Social Development in Young Children2," During the toddler years, it is important to continue involving children in situations where they can interact with other children. This is especially important if there are no siblings in the home. This can be done by enrolling the toddler in some type of childcare or joining a local play group.


At this stage in life, a child’s world expands greatly because they are mobile and they are learning to speak.

, In the toddler's mind, everything belongs to the toddler and the social act of sharing becomes an issue. There are many different ways that a parent can handle the development of sharing. However, always keep in mind that the child’s concept of ownership of the object is natural and they are acting selfish just to be mean to the other child.


In order to help the child pass the social development milestone of learning to share, the child should not be scolded or reprimanded for claiming the object.
Instead, the parent should use a calm voice and simple words to discuss the concept of sharing with the toddler and help the toddler separate themselves from the object more easily.

, During sharing instruction is where the parent can begin to teach simple negotiation techniques such as taking timed turns so that sharing is fair. If the concept is too difficult for the toddler to grasp at the time, then it is best to remove the contested object from the sight and reach of the children.


This should be done without placing blame on either of the children.
For example, many parents tell the children that the toy is having a “time out”.
After the children seem to have forgotten the object, it can be returned to the room, but should not be handed to either of the children.

, Sometimes toddlers act aggressively when another child tries to get a toy or object that they have. They might hit, bite, or in other ways harm the other child in order to retain possession of the object. Of course, this is not socially acceptable behavior, but the parent needs to bear in mind that the toddler is still learning how to behave socially and needs guidance through this stage.


The aggressive toddler will usually give physical or verbal warning signs before this negative interaction.
In protesting the approach of the other child, the toddler might continually take the object to an area away from the other child or they might simply turn their back toward the other child.
Some toddlers will vocalize their disapproval of the approaching child. Even if it is just a grunt or squeal, it is their way of issuing a warning.
By learning to recognize these warning signs, the parent can steer their toddler toward a more positive and socially acceptable response to the situation that will help them learn better ways to resolve the conflicts in their lives.

Support social interaction with friends.,
Talk to your child about handling negative feelings and interactions.,
Encourage your child to independently solve social problems.,
Observe the behavior of your child carefully.",How to Support Social Development in Young Children3," At this age, young children are beginning to form close friendships and might even have one or more best friends. It is important for the parents to support this social interaction as much as possible. You can do this by allowing the children to have more extensive play dates.


Play dates could include things such as attending parties at the homes of their friends or even arranging an outing for the families to attend together.

, During this time, children might also start to develop dislikes of some other children and find out that others might not like them. Both of these circumstances are natural parts of social development, but can lead to hurt feelings if not handled properly. At this stage in social development, you can talk to your child about their feelings in order to help them understand that everyone is different and has different likes and dislikes.


There is nothing wrong with preferring the company of one child to another, but it is wrong to say or do things that are hurtful toward someone else.
This is another part of the development of empathy.
You should reassure your child if he or she feels disliked and help them believe in themselves.
If the child has done or said something hurtful to another child, it is important to help them understand why it is wrong. Simply having the child apologize may seem socially correct, but if it is just meaningless words, they aren’t learning an important social skill.
Help your child understand why their actions or words were wrong. A good way to help a child grasp this is to ask how they would feel if someone did or said those hurtful things to them.
If the child has trouble putting feelings into words, you can give suggestions until they find one that the child can relate to in regards to the situation.

, Allowing children to solve problems themselves allows them to develop a variety of social skills. React only when necessary, and intervene if there is a dangerous problem.


Parents who often react before their child hinder their child’s social development, because social skills are best taught through experience.

, When you see that he wants to perfect a skill or a try out something new, give him support. For example, if a child is trying to overcome self-feeding, help him, give him cutlery and let him learn to feed himself. With the other fork, you can feed your child because the first steps of self-feed can be clumsy.


When you respond in this way to your child's needs and desires, noticing their efforts and helping them, your child will develop self-respect and self-esteem.

Reassure your child before the first day of school.,
Encourage your child to talk about their school day.,
Maintain open communication with your child.",How to Support Social Development in Young Children4," The first day of school is a big step towards becoming a part of society. Children are often anxious because they don’t know what it will be like to be away from home and family every day. The parent can be reassuring and supportive by listening to the child and discussing their fears, while pointing out some of the positive aspects of going to school.

, At the end of the first day of school, the child should be encouraged to talk openly about their day and the parent should listen attentively and comment appropriately. This means that if the child had a great day the parent should rejoice with them.


If the child’s day didn’t go so well, the parent should empathize with the child and help them develop a strategy for making the next day, and all of the following days, better.

, As the child grows, keeping an open line of communication regarding feelings is important for social development. When possible and appropriate, the parent should share their own feelings of sadness, fear, or other emotions that are often hidden, so that the child can more easily understand that everyone has all types of feelings and it is not shameful to express them at appropriate times.

Consider no lock screen.,
Set “Slide.” Selecting this option will put a small lock icon in the bottom middle of your screen each time you press the Power button to activate your device.,
Use “Face unlock.” This method is actually not very secure on older devices, like this one, because someone who looks even remotely like you can unlock your device.,
Know when to use these.,
Set “Voice Unlock.” After selecting this option, you will be greeted by a series of four different options.,
Use a pattern.,
Try a PIN.,
Set a password.,
Test your lock screen.",How to Set Up Screen Lock on an Alcatel One Touch," Open the app (application) tray, also called the app drawer, and scroll through until you see “Settings”. It looks like a gray gear icon. Tap this to open.;
, Scroll down to find the Security settings option, and tap to open. A list of settings related to the security of your device will be found here.

, At the top of the page, you should see “Set up screen lock”; tap this to open the Lock Screen settings.


You should now see a series of seven different lock screen options in front of you—None, Slide, Face Unlock, Voice Unlock, Pattern, PIN, and Password—each will be a little different than the last. Note that some are far more secure than others.

, For those who want less hassle when unlocking your device, the first three options might just be for you. Be warned though, this can put the personal information saved in your device at risk if ever it gets stolen.

, This would be the obvious “None” option in the menu. Selecting this option means you won’t actually have a lock screen at all. When you hit your Power button, it will simply turn on your screen and you will be on your device homepage.

, Place your finger on the lock icon and move any direction, usually about an inch or so, to unlock your device.

, People have even used pictures of people to unlock their devices.


If you want to use this option, make sure that the area you are in is well-lit and you hold your device at face level with the screen towards you. On the screen, you should see a series of dots in a face-shaped circle. The device will use the front-facing camera to see your face. Once it can see your face properly, each of the dots on the screen will turn green. Once this has completed the circle, you are good to go.
There is a pattern unlock you must also set, which is used as a backup just in case the face unlock doesn’t work. A series of 9 different dots will appear on your screen. Place your finger on one and slide it across at least 4 different dots and repeat. Remember this pattern because you may need it later if your face unlock doesn’t work properly.
When unlocking your device for face unlock, you will also need to make sure that you are in a well-lit area. Press the Power button and you should see the face-shaped dots on the screen. Place your face inside these dots by adjusting the front-facing camera angle, and the phone should quickly unlock.

, For many people, security takes priority. If somebody steals your device, you probably don’t want them to be able open it and see all your personal information. Fortunately, these features offer the security you want

, The one you are primarily looking for is the top one, which should say “Unlock command.” Tap this.


Now, repeat a word or phrase that has 2–8 syllables, 3–6 times. Make sure to vary your voice tone and inflection so that the device can learn your voice a little better as you go. There should be a percentage bar that moves across your screen with each successful attempt.
When you’re done, you will be required to create a pattern in case the voice unlock is unsuccessful.
To unlock the device, you simply press the Power button, wait to see the screen, then speak the phrase you created earlier. You should see a little microphone button on the bottom middle of your screen. If you see an X on the mic this means the mic is off. Tap the mic button to turn the mic on again, and speak your phrase, same as before.

, The “Pattern” lock screen option is one of the most secure options for unlocking your device. A series of 9 different dots will appear on your screen. Place your finger on one and slide it across to at least 4 different dots, and repeat. You can then use this method to unlock your device.


This pattern will also lock certain features in your settings. You may need to enter your pattern in order to unlock these features should you need them. You will be notified if this will be required or not.

, You will need to enter a series of numbers in order to unlock your device. You will be required to enter a PIN with no less than 4 digits, and no more than 17. This will be required each time you would like to unlock your device.


This PIN will also lock certain features in your settings. You may need to enter your PIN in order to unlock these features should you need them. You will be notified if this will be required or not.

, The “Password” option is probably the most secure lock screen, as it can contain numbers, letters, and symbols. When you tap “Password,” you’ll be shown two text boxes. Enter your password, no less than 4 characters and no more than 17, in both boxes to finish. This password will now be required each time you unlock your device.


This password will also lock certain features in your settings. You may need to enter your password in order to unlock these features should you need them. You will be notified if this will be required or not.

, Regardless of the method you choose, it is important to make sure that your security measures work properly. Each time you choose a different method, make sure to test it out. Make sure you are comfortable with it, and that it works the way you want."

They will just add a Wi-Fi router to your existing network connection to provide wireless connectivity.


If you prefer doing stuff on your own, you can purchase your own Wi-Fi router from your local computer store for under $100 and add it to your home network by following the included instructions inside its box.;
, If you haven’t used your smartphone for quite some time, plug it to a power outlet and charge its batteries for at least a full 1 to 2 hours (depending on the recommended charging time of the unit you’re using) to make sure that it has enough power.

, Swipe down the Android’s home screen to show its Notification Tray. Tap the “Wi-Fi” button on the upper portion of the screen to enable its Wi-Fi connectivity.


Once its Wi-Fi is switched on, your old Android phone should automatically connect to your Wi-Fi network.
If your network is password-protected, a dialog box will appear on your phone’s screen, asking you to type in a password. Just enter the password of your Wi-Fi network and your device should be able to connect to the Wi-Fi.

, Tap the Play Store app icon on your Android’s home screen, or app drawer, to open it.


Google Play Store is the application market where you can download software exclusively for Android devices.

, Tap the magnifying glass icon and type in “VoIP” on the text field that will appear. Press the “Enter” or “Done” key on your device keyboard to begin your search, and a list of apps closely related to your search will be displayed on the screen.


VoIP, or Voice-over Internet Protocol applications, are softwares designed for Android that let you make phone calls and even send out text messages for free using Internet connectivity instead of the traditional telephone or mobile phone lines. This makes the calls, if not at all free, a lot cheaper than your normal phone calls using your landline or mobile network.
There are several VoIP apps that you can find on Google Play Store. Some of the most popular choices are Viber by Viber Media and Zoiper IAX SIP VOIP Softphone by Securax LTD.

, Once you’ve made your choice, tap the icon with three dots beside the name of the app, and tap on “Install.”


Tap the green “Accept” button on the Permissions page that appears, and the VoIP app you selected will be automatically downloaded and installed on your Android.

, Tap the newly created icon of the VoIP app from your Android’s home or application screen to launch it.

, VoIP apps work like your usual phone dialer. Inside the application you’ll see the common keypad dialer, a list of contacts locally saved in your phone, and your previous call and message histories.


To place a call, simply dial the telephone or mobile number you want to reach using the app’s keypad and press the call key (phone icon) you’ll see on the same section to begin the call.
You’ll hear the usual phone ring from the other end of the line once the application successfully connects to the number you dialed.

, To disconnect the call, simply tap the “End” button you’ll see on the VoIP app’s screen. The call will be immediately terminated, and you’ll be taken back to the app’s dial screen.

Upgrade your Raspberry Pi.,
Download BitTorrent Sync to your Raspberry Pi.,
Extract the compressed folder.,
Find out your IP address.,
Start BitTorrent Sync.,
Set up a Username and Password for BitTorrent Sync.,
Create a name for file-sharing.,
Download and install BitTorrent Sync on the device you wish to sync with.,
Create/add the folder you wish to sync on your Raspberry Pi.,
Add a peer to have access to your folder.,
Link your Raspberry Pi BitTorrent Sync folder to your device.,
Sync files between devices.",How to Set Up Bittorrent Sync on Your Raspberry Pi,"


To ensure that BitTorrent Sync will be compatible with your version of Raspbian, a command will be typed into the command prompt window to serve this function. Type the below command with no edit.
sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
Wait until the download and installation is complete before proceeding onto the next step.;
,

The first step to setting up your Raspberry Pi BitTorrent Sync server is to download the necessary software to your Raspberry Pi so that it can be installed.
First off, you want to select where we will be extracting the BitTorrent Sync files. Type the exact command below to do so:

cd /home/pi






Once you are within this directory by typing up this command, type this next line. This line will go to the BitTorrent Sync website and download the latest ARM release. Note that it is important that the ARM version of the Linux packages available is downloaded, for this is the version that is compatible with the Raspberry pi. You can do this by typing the command below:

wget ""https://download-cdn.getsync.com/stable/linux-arm/BitTorrent-Sync_arm.tar.gz""






Wait until the download is complete before moving onto the next step.

,


Extract the BitTorrent-Sync_arm.tar.gz file (which is what you downloaded earlier) by typing in the command below:
tar xzf BitTorrent-Sync_arm.tar.gz

, To be able to specify information that BitTorrent Sync needs to properly run your server, you need to figure out your IP address. You can do so by typing the command below. The character following 'hostname' is a capital 'i'.






hostname -I
Once you have run the command, you'll see output appear on your screen with numbers and dots. This is your IP address.
Take note of this IP address, as you will need it later in the article.

,


To start BitTorrent, type the command below without edit.
./btsync --webui.listen 0.0.0.0:8888

,


Start by opening up a web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, etc.).
Once you have your web browser open, type the link below, substituting <IP> with your own IP address that you got earlier.
http::8888
You should arrive at a screen that will prompt you to create a Username and Password for your BitTorrent Sync software. Enter in the credentials as you wish, then press the 'Continue' button.

,


Type into the the 'Username' box what you want your name to be for file-sharing. Note that this does not need to be the same username as entered in the step prior.
After reading the terms and conditions, remember to accept them and click upon the 'Continue' button.
After clicking the Continue button, enter in the credentials for your BitTorrent Sync Identity to load up the webpage you'll use for File management.

,

These instructions vary from device to device. This step assumes you are using a Windows Operating System
In your browser, navigate to https://www.getsync.com/

Click upon the 'Free Download' button to begin your download.
Once the download is complete, execute the file and select the options you want, but make sure to select the option that prompts you to open BitTorrent Sync after install. Once again, you'll be prompted to create a username to connect with. Choose a different one than the one you used for your Raspberry Pi.
You should now have two instances of BitTorrent Sync Running: One in your browser and one in a window via the earlier download.

,


In the browser, navigate to the top right corner and click upon the 'Add Folder' button and press continue on the next window.
Next, navigate to where you'll be storing your files on your Raspberry pi. In this guide, it is assumed to be in the '/home/pi/BTSync' Folder (where you can replace 'BTSync' with any name of your choosing). This will require navigating to the '/home/pi' directory first, and then creating a 'BTSync' folder by using the 'New Folder' option below.
Following that, click the 'Read & Write' option on the next window, then close out of that same window. Your BitTorrent Sync tab should still be open afterwords.
You should also see that a new folder has been added to BitTorrent Sync with no peers.

,


In the browser window for BitTorrent Sync, hover your mouse underneath the Gear present in the top-righthand corner of the corner. You should see a clickable option to select 'Options' for your new folder. Note that this is not the gear icon, but rather, the icon is three dots aligned vertically. Click upon this option, then click the 'Copy Read & Write' key in the following drop-down menu.
Copy the key that appears to your clipboard by following the on-screen instructions.

,


Navigating to your device's BitTorrent Sync window, click upon the 'Options' Icon in the top-right hand corner. Then, select 'Manual Connection' for the following drop-down window.
A prompt should appear requesting a key. Paste the key you copied earlier in your browser into this field and click the 'Next' Button.
Select where on this device you wish to sync your files. If you pick an already existing folder, everything in that folder and all sub-folders will begin syncing to your Raspberry Pi. It is recommended you create a new Folder for the specific purpose of syncing.

,

To sync files between your Raspberry Pi and your device, you need to simply take the file you wish to sync in question, and put in the appropriate folder (which is the same folder you created/selected earlier when creating a folder in BitTorrent Sync). In this guide, that folder was 'BTSync'. Once you do this, the other device will copy the folder to it's respective folder. Keep in mind that if you delete a file on either device from their folder, that your second device will delete them as well if you have syncing enabled (which it is by default).

Familiarise yourself with the pushers (the buttons at the side of the watch).,
Make sure you're on the main time screen.,
When on the main time screen, hold down the top left ""adjust"" button for a couple of seconds.,
Change the seconds by using the top right or bottom right buttons (depending on if you want to go up or down) and then press the bottom left ""mode"" button to move on to the next part of the time.,
Now either the hour or minutes will be flashing.,
It should now let you change the date.,
Depending on the model of your watch, if may now ask you to select whether you want 12hr or 24hr time.,
To finish, press the top left ""adjust"" button to lock in your time.,
If your watch has an analogue time as well as digital time, if you're very lucky the watch will automatically calibrate the analogue time to match the digital time.,
Now hold in the top left ""adjust"" button for a couple of seconds.,
Hold the bottom right button in to move the minute hand.,
When the hands match the digi time, press top left ""adjust"" button to lock it in and you're done!,
Enjoy your Baby G Watch now that it tells the right time!

",How to Set the Time on a Baby G Watch," Top left is generally your ""adjust"" button, bottom left ""mode"", and top right and bottom right will allow you to alter number values up and down.;
, Press the bottom left ""mode"" button to run through the screens if you're not sure - you will pass things such as the Hand Set, alarm, stopwatch, timer and world time. The main time screen will generally come up after world time. Press the bottom left button each time you want to change screen.

, You will hear a beep and the numbers will begin to flash, usually starting with the seconds. (Depending on the style of watch, your Home City may flash first. If so, use the top right and bottom right buttons to change the city to the nearest one to you in the same time zone. E.g. if you are in Brisbane, Australia, set it to Syd (Sydney).)

, If you don't want to set the seconds, just press ""mode"" straight away.

, Use the top right and bottom right buttons to adjust. Press mode to move on to the other time value (hour or minute, depending on what you changed first). Once you have the time right, press the bottom left ""mode"" button again.

, Again, using the top right and bottom right buttons, adjust the day, month or year depending on what the watch lets you change first. Press the bottom left ""mode"" button to progress to the next part of the date and repeat until day, month and year are all correct.

, Select using top right/bottom right buttons and hit mode again. When you have set every element, you will eventually be brought back to the start (i.e. flashing seconds or flashing Home City, depending on the watch).

, Presto, you're done! Unless you have a digi/analogue watch, in which case read on.

, If your watch doesn't do this (i.e. the hands tell a different time to the digital), press the bottom left ""mode"" button until the digital screen says ""H-S (with the digital time)"" ""H-S"" ""Hand Set"" ""Hand Set (digi time)"" or similar. This is your hand set screen.

, You will hear a beep and the digital screen will probably start flashing. Use the top right and bottom right buttons to move the hands. Some models will only let you move one way using the bottom right button so you may have to be patient. Pressing the bottom right button moves the minute hand by one minute and holding it in will make the hand move around faster.

, You may have to wait to go through the hours until it matches with the digital time. As you get closer to the right time (e.g. you are 10 minutes off being correct) stop holding the bottom right button and press it the final few times to set it to the time you need. If you hold on too long, you may go past the time you need and have to go around all over again. V. frustrating.

, Some watches may automatically return you to the main time screen. If your digi screen still says ""H-S"" ""H-Set"" etc. then hit the bottom left ""mode"" button until you come back around to the main screen.

Give your current collectors the first invitation to view your online art gallery.,
Market your online gallery.,
Update your artwork regularly.",How to Set Up a Digital Art Gallery," If you are not a good photographer, then hire someone to take the photographs. They should be taken in good lighting with 1 or 2 detail shots of each piece.


If you are a sculptor, this is especially important. Painters can often crop their photos, so that the image is the only thing inside the picture. Sculptors usually need a platform, a background and some white space around the edges.;
, Make sure each piece has at least 72 dots per inch (DPI), or preferably an even higher resolution. 72 dpi often allows you to email, while online galleries usually allow larger files to be uploaded.

, You can choose to create your own website with a digital gallery, sign up for a digital gallery account with an artists' website or use free online galleries. Your choice should be based on your marketing budget and familiarity with computers.


Set up a high quality website. This is a great idea for people who want to market themselves to both collectors and galleries. You must buy a domain, choose a platform that can host high-resolution digital media, your resume, a blog, your biography and more. Unless you are already a web-programmer, you should buy your domain and then hire someone to create an attractive site that will allow you to keep a digital gallery for years to come. This requires a large investment at first, but has few long-term costs.
Join a site that already markets to the online art consumer. Good examples of this platform are Exhibit A, 20x200, art.sy, artroof.com, ArtSpan, FolioLink, ArtPickle and gallery-worldwide.com. They range in pricing. Some high end galleries require an invitation. Some places offer yearly subscriptions for a few hundred dollars, while other places offer monthly rates between $5 and $25.
Choose to create an online gallery through a free service. This includes imagekind.com, Facebook, Artmajeur.com, Vlad Art Gallery and ShowOffArt.com. The main drawback of using a free service is that you have less control over your images and the people who view them. They can be downloaded off the site. In the case of ImageKind, you are uploading a gallery for free, but people can only buy prints of your work. Make sure to read the terms and conditions closely before signing up for any free services.
Consider watermarking your images, if you are afraid they will be used without your permission. You can do this with Adobe Photoshop or Google Plus. This is especially a good idea if you are a photographer, because your images may show up on Google Images and be used as clip art.

, Sign up and then read the instructions carefully. Each site requires different resolutions, so make sure you do your photo editing on your computer before you upload.


Some subscriptions to online galleries come with gallery management software. You would install the software on your computer, and it would help you organize updates to your gallery using this software and then upload the changes when you are ready.

, Keep in mind that some works of art do not show up very well, so you may want to save them for shows or galleries. You can also include a detail shot of a piece and note that it is a ""detail"" of the previous work.


List the artist, title, media, dimensions and price in the appropriate caption boxes. Your customers should be afforded each detail, in order to help them make decisions.

, You should have a dedicated phone line and email, if you choose the latter. Some websites and online galleries require you to have an online shopping cart.


Test your shopping cart, if that is the way you have chosen to sell your art. Buy a piece of art and make sure you receive communication about payment and shipping.

, This is a great way to move from traditional methods of selling your art to the online market while telling them that you value their business. Many digital art galleries send out email blasts via Constant Contact, Vertical Response or Volusion.


These email blast companies allow you to upload your current customer's emails, create an email from a template and send to your list. They also offer your feedback as far as how many people opened it and how many people clicked on the link to your gallery. These companies offer 1-month trials, so you can try the product before you subscribe for a monthly fee.

, Once your portfolio is online, it is only the beginning of the process. You must use social media, email newsletters, blogs, studio photographs and more to make sure you are marketing your art. Many people choose to post their art online instead of being represented by a gallery, but this means the burden of promotion falls on you, rather than experienced art promoters.


Sign up for free social media accounts, such as Tumblr and Facebook. Cross-reference these accounts with your email blasts and online site. They can help you to make announcements about art sales, new pieces, galleries and shows.

, Make sure you get into the habit of uploading new art, updating customers and consistently communicating via social media. Consistency is especially important in online marketing.

Choose a reliable solar panel brand.,
Select a charger with the right wattage.,
Choose a durable portable solar charger.,
Purchase the right adapters.,
Learn about your device's options.,
Know your device's warning signs.,
Reliable portable solar panels can help ensure that you can use electronic devices anywhere.",How to Select a Solar Charger," There are three variables that determine whether a solar panel is reliable: brand, wattage and durability. First, there are a number of knock-off solar panels available from discount sellers. Purchasing one of these products is not advisable because you need your solar panels to work without fail in all circumstances -- so even if the solar charges work when you test them, if you can't expect them to work in an emergency, they are useless. To determine whether a brand is reliable, you can do online research to see what others are saying about the brand or ask the owner of specialty stores what their most reliable brands are. You can also conduct research using customer research tools like Consumer Reports. Some common solar panel brands include Sunlinq, Lenmar and Goal Zero.;
, In addition to brand, wattage is another important component in portable solar charger reliability. When you are choosing a portable solar charger, you must select a charger with a wattage large enough to charge the devices that you need to charge. This means that if you are trying to charge more powerful devices -- like laptops or generators -- you need to have more wattage. Most solar charger stores display the wattage on the product's information sheet or box. Before you go shopping, however, you should not only know what kind of devices you will need to charge but what their wattage is.

, Finally, durability is an important component in purchasing reliable solar panels. You should not only ensure that the solar chargers you are purchasing are strong enough to handle damage or being dropped, but you should also ensure that they are strong enough to handle what you could encounter in the wilderness if you plan to take your solar panels camping or hiking -- this includes severe weather. Many companies manufacture waterproof solar chargers. To determine whether an individual solar charger is durable, individuals should not only determine how the manufactures make that charger durable -- protective coatings, shells, etc. -- but also what others have to say about the durability of the panels. Online forums and review pages are helpful for conducting this research.

, You will not be able to charge your portable devices if you do not choose a portable solar charger with the right adapters. As you're likely aware, your cell phone and tablet are charged with different kinds of cords that have different tips. Most portable solar chargers come with a number of different adapters that are designed to work with some of the most popular brands or popular types of adapters, like the mini-USB adapter. Other solar USB chargers require that you purchase accessories so that they will work with your devices. Luckily, most portable solar panels have the capability of charging many devices -- such as devices that require an AC adapter and popular camera and MP3 player adapters. Before purchasing a device, make sure it can charge your device using the type of adapter you have and determine whether you need to make that purchase separately.

, Most portable solar chargers can be used in a variety of ways. For example, some chargers can be used as AC adapters or USB adapters as well as solar chargers. In other words, you may have the option to either plug the adapter into an outlet or laptop or to use stored solar power to charge your devices. Knowing the many different ways in which your adapter can function can help you determine what is the most economical, green or practical way to use your charger at any given moment. For example, if you have an outlet available, you may want to save the stored solar power for the next time you do not have an available outlet.

, Before using your device for the first time, carefully read the instruction manual that informs you of potential dangers that your device may be subject to, such as surges or mishandling. Know how many devices you can plug into your device and do not exceed that amount. Understand how your device should be stored when not in use. This will help increase your device's lifespan.

, They also mean you don't have to worry about charging these devices. These devices are essential for those who depend on their mobile lifestyles -- from requiring generators to provide electricity while camping to charging cell phones so they will be ready in case of an emergency. However, if you don't know how to use portable solar chargers, you may make the wrong decision either when purchasing one or when trying to use it for the first time. By using the above guide, you'll have a better chance of choosing the right solar device.

, It is important that the power cord you are choosing is certified by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). Irrespective of the power cord you choose, ensure that it is NEMA certified. It will also make it easier to select the power cord plug.

, The voltage rating for plugs in North America ranges from 100-127 to 200-240. Confirm the voltage required to run your server before choosing the power cord.

, Another specification to check is the current rating. The ratings for North America are 15, 20, and 30. Knowing the voltage rating can help to accordingly find the power cord with the right current rating.

, The number of prongs in a plug varies from 2 to 5. The prongs can be oval, round, straight blade, and rectangular in shape. For North America, there 4 different types of power plugs - NEMA 5-15P, NEMA 5-20P, NEMA L6-20P, NEMA L15-30P. Knowledge of the current rating and voltage can help discern between the four types and choose the correct plug.

Connect your scanner to your computer.,
Power the scanner and turn the scanner on.,
Place whatever you want to scan into the scanner.,
Follow the directions from the scanner's manual as well as the scanner's third-party software to ensure you are pressing the right buttons.,
Crop the previewed image if the scanning software you use offers you to preview the scan before you save the image.,
Save the image.",How to Scan and Print Pictures from a Computer1," Although most of today's scanners connect via USB cords, some older scanners connect to the serial and parallel ports on most computers. Plug the smaller end of the USB cord into your scanner's slot, and the bigger end into your PC.;
, Plug in the power cord to the scanner as well as the other end into the electrical outlet , and turn the device on. If you've already connected the scanner to your computer to grab the drivers to run the scanner to your computer, you can turn each item on in whatever order you feel to be most comfortable; however, if not, prepare to turn on the scanner once you are logged into your computer's user account.

, Make sure that the picture is face down onto the scanner glass. Almost all scanners will have tiny insignias mentioning in which corner the picture will need to be placed. Place it a teensy-weensie bit below this area.


If the scanner has what's called a automatic document feeder, do not use this. Using these, on top of not being able to re-obtain the finished pictures, will also cause the pictures to jam the machine and the picture will also smudge. Only use the flatbed area of your scanner to obtain scans of your pictures.


, Sometimes the button will be called ""Scan"" and other times it may be called something else entirely.


Sometimes, pressing the Scan button on your scanner will launch your scanning software, while other times, you can open your software where you can import pictures via your scanner and scan using this.
Do not take your picture from the scanner flatbed portion. Most scanners will need to rescan a select portion and save that area (as you'll see later).

, Make sure that any of the white background that was used isn't showing in your finished image, and remember to rotate the image if possible.

, Most often doing so, this will take a secondary scan of the item as to scan only those areas.

Purchase a good quality flatbed scanner.,
Gather your photo collection.,
Ensure that you have ample storage space on your computer.,
Follow the setup instructions that come with your external hard drive for connecting it to you computer, then open the software program that came with your scanner.,
Verify that your scanner is set to optimize photos, just remember that the greater DPI (Dots per inch) setting you use, the better quality you will have if you go to print later, however, conversely, the greater amount of storage will be required per scanned photo.,
Once you scan your first set or group of photos, verify that they are in fact saving to the location you chose.,
At this point the process becomes pretty monotonous, you simply go through, photo by photo, load them onto your scanner, scan them in accordingly, and verify that they are saving where you want them to save.,
Once you are done with all your photos, you can choose to clone your hard drive, or make additional copies onto additional hard drives, CD's, or even DVD's and you can share those copies between family members, or others that you trust for safe keeping.",How to Save Your Family Photos Electronically," These are pretty reasonable in price now. You can get something that will do a great job for under $100.00 at most any retail store. Follow the instructions and install the accompanying software on your computer and physically connect (or wirelessly) your scanner to your computer.;
, This can be A) very daunting, and B) extremely intimidating. Take a shot at it, one (1) album or group of photos at a time. (Make sure you come up with a way to identify each album or group of photos as complete once scanned. This is simple you can attached a label to the album, or group, or put them in a completed location, several options, use your imagination).

, This is another external cost that is minimal when it comes to the loss of your photos. You can get a very large external hard drive for well under $100.00 at any electronics retailer or online. Depending on the # of photos you have, you may benefit from dedicating an external hard drive to photo storage.

, Within this program you will be able to adjust the settings and tell the scanner and computer where to store your scanned photos. If you are following my steps above, you would browse and find your external hard drive, and place it as the default save location for your scans.

, You have to find a happy medium; you may choose to scan at a lower DPI (300 - 400) because when printing, this allows for very nice prints without eating up massive amounts of storage.

, This can be done by browsing your computer and verifying that your photos are where you expect them to be.

, Once you have a group of photos digitized, you can go into the folder with the photos and name them individually as you wish, by right clicking on the photo and either changing the name (PC), or going to Get Info (MAC) and changing the name.

, The hard part is over, now you can rest assured that you have multiple copies of your photos spread across multiple locations, so as to avert disasters in one location by creating multiple copies and placing in various locations.

Launch the program that you use to view your pictures.,
Open the file of the picture you saved previously in this program.,
Preview your picture, as you turn on your printer (if it isn't initially on).,
Save your file to ensure the most current picture will print, if you've made any changes.

,
Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+P or whatever keyboard shortcut the print menu can be found in.

,
Select the printer it should be printing on, as well as any other document style specifications that might need to be set.,
Print the photo.",How to Scan and Print Pictures from a Computer2," Sometimes this can be based off your operating system and sometimes this is a third-party software (such as Adobe Photoshop) or sometimes it's another program entirely different.

, Most often times, this will be done with a quick keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+O, but you'll need to refer to your program documentation menus to ensure this can be done in your program, as not all programs use the same methods to open the Open window.

, Make sure that the picture is really the one you want to view. Make any final adjustments to the picture to make the picture even better. If you aren't a photo-expert and can trust your program to make good decisions, use an Auto-Adjust setting to fix up your photos in edit mode. If you can't, you can manually adjust them with sliders and within the program boundaries until they are to exactly the style you'd like them to be.

,,, This may include the amount of copies that need to be printed, as well as type of paper that is installed in the printer. Some printers will need you to select other options such as borderless printing and the like, but each printer is different, so follow the directions to your particular printer to find out what that printer is capable of printing.

, Use the buttons on your computer to print the photo.

Try ZIP Ultimate Cracker.,
Use Zip Password Recovery Professional.",How to Remove the Password from a Zip File Without Knowing the Password," You'll need to download a program that can guess the password on the zip file. Before you do this, be aware that this can infect your computer with a virus. Review safe browsing practices and install antivirus software before you continue.


The programs suggested below have been checked by several automatic malware scans, but this is not a guarantee of safety.
Most free trial versions will only crack short passwords. Be wary of free programs with no limitations — there is usually no incentive for a company to provide this, besides installing adware or other malware on your computer.;
, In most cases, the program will take several hours to guess the password, unless the password is a single word. Passwords with 9 or more characters (and that don't spell a word) may take multiple days to guess.There is no way to quickly guess the password within a few minutes.


The one exception is a ZIP archive that contains multiple files protected by the same password, one of which you already have access to. In this case, some programs can use a ""known-plaintext"" attack to figure out the password based on the file you have access to., Visit Elcomsoft.com to download the Advanced Archive Password Recovery program. Scroll to the bottom of the page, then click ""Download free trial version."" The trail version can only recover passwords 4 characters or shorter.The full version costs $49.


If the ZIP file contains two or more files with different passwords, you'll need to create several copies and delete files within them, so that each ZIP archive only contains a single password., You can download the shareware version here. This uses several good approaches, but the free version will only show you the first five characters. If this isn't enough to jog your memory, you may need to purchase the full version for $59, or purchase a single use for a smaller amount.This program has not been updated in a long time, so it may stop working after an update to your OS. It is made for Windows 2000, XP, Vista, and 7.

, The trial version of this software is free, but will only crack passwords under a certain length. Visit this website and click Download Now to begin. Open the downloaded file to install the program.

, Nitric acid is a clear liquid chemical commonly used for various industrial, steel, and wood works. You can purchase nitric acid from industrial or chemical shops.


In some states and countries, however, you might be prohibited from buying nitric acid or you might have to meet certain standards before you’re allowed to purchase it. Check with your local authorities before purchasing.







, The container should preferably be Pyrex glassware or the kind that can withstand extreme heat.


Break the circuit boards into smaller pieces before you put them in the glass container.






Do not use plastic containers as the acid might burn right through it.







, As you put the acid in, burning fumes will start to come out of the container, so make sure you’re wearing protective gear.

, Since gold requires stronger chemicals to be dissolved, the nitric acid will melt all the plastic and metal parts of the circuit board without harming the gold bits.

, Use a filter to separate the solid parts from the liquid.

, These parts will have the gold. Some plastic may still be attached to the gold, so you need to separate these little bits off the gold yourself. Be sure to use industrial strength gloves when you do so.

Get protective gear.,
Get a metal bin or tray, and put the circuit boards into it.,
Light the boards on fire.,
Put out the fire.,
Break off the pieces of plastic attached to the gold parts.",How to Remove Gold from Circuit Boards2," Be sure to wear a face mask, safety glasses, and industrial gloves to avoid breathing in the fumes released by the burning plastic. Use steel tongs to turn over the burning circuit boards.

, Break the boards into smaller pieces so they burn faster.

, Pour a bit of gasoline over the pieces to put the pieces on fire. Turn the burning pieces over using steel tongs, and wait until the boards are burnt black.

, Allow the pieces to cool down a little—just warm enough so you can touch them, but not too cooled down that the plastic hardens again.

, The burning process should have made the board materials brittle and easy to break.


To be safe, wear protective gloves when breaking off the plastic.

Use damp (not wet) cloths.,
Clean on flat surfaces.,
Do not spray directly on the screen.,
Use a microfiber cloth.,
Don’t use harsh chemicals on your touch screen.",How to Remove an Ink Stain from a Touch Screen1," Using a damp cloth will prevent liquid from pooling on your touch screen. If the liquid pools, it could seep into cracks or seals, especially those around the device’s buttons.If, in removing an ink stain from your touch screen, you get liquid from a cleaning agent, baby wipe, or other solution into a seal or crack, consult manufacturer directions for information regarding how to respond.;
, Positioning your touch screen at an angle or in an upright position could cause the cleaning liquid to drip down the surface and into cracks or seals on your device. Only remove an ink stain from a touch screen on a table, desk, or other flat, smooth surface., Doing so could cause an excess of cleaning solution to pool on the touch screen’s surface. If you’ve decided to use a cleaning method in which you have control over how much liquid to use, spray the liquid onto the cloth you intend to use rather than onto the device itself., A microfiber cloth is the best option for removing an ink stain from a touch screen. Microfiber cloths are specially designed to capture grime. They feature a nonabrasive texture that prevents them from scratching your touch screen. If you can’t get a microfiber cloth, use another gentle and nonabrasive cleaning cloth., Ammonia-based cleaning agents or products that contain a high volume of alcohol could eat away at your touch screen. A partial list of such products includes nail polish remover, WD-40, and many glass cleaners."
"
Try baby wipes.,
Use a homemade alcohol spray.,
Use a specialized cleaning solution.,
Invest in a screen protector.",How to Remove an Ink Stain from a Touch Screen2," Baby wipes are moistened disposable tissues meant to clean a baby’s skin. Since they are designed to be gentle and non-abrasive, they are ideal for cleaning ink stains on a touch screen. To use the baby wipe, simply wipe the ink stain with it in a circular motion using gentle pressure.You can use isopropyl alcohol wipes in the same way.Cleaning agents with high concentrations of alcohol could prove damaging to your touch screen, but isopropyl alcohol wipes do not contain high concentrations of alcohol.
After wiping the touch screen with the wipes, use a dry cloth to wipe away any remaining residue.

, Mix equal parts distilled water and 99 percent isopropyl alcohol in a small spray bottle. Spray a bit of the solution onto a clean microfiber cloth. Using a gentle circular motion, rub the ink stain from your touch screen.If any residue remains after cleaning, spray another cloth with distilled water and wipe the touch screen with it.

, Depending on the product you are attempting to clean, you might be able to utilize a specialized cleaning product. The specific directions for use vary with the specialized cleaning product you choose to use. Generally, however, you will simply spray a small amount of the cleaning solution onto your cleaning cloth, then use it to wipe away the ink stain.Consult manufacturer instructions for information about whether a specialized cleaning product could help you remove an ink stain from your touch screen.

, Once you’ve cleaned the ink stain, you should take proactive steps to avoid getting additional ink stains on your touch screen. The best way to do this is to equip your device with a screen protector (a transparent plastic sheet that fits the exact dimensions of your screen).Screen protectors are available online or at most major electronics goods stores.

If you're selling it, set a reasonable price.,
If you're not selling it, use it.",How to Refurbish a Computer," Yes, just look at the computer. Look at it from every angle, and ask yourself about it. On the top: is there any damage to the case? On both sides: is there any damage to the case? Is there a fan on the left side? Is the fan broken? On the back: What ports does this computer have? Are they all on the motherboard, or are some expansions? Is there a PSU? On the front: What disk drives do I see? Is there any obvious damage to the USB ports on the front of the case (if there are any)?;
, Find a power cord, and plug it in. Power it on, and observe. If it doesn't power on at all, something could be wrong in the case. If it powers on and beeps, something could be wrong in the case. If it powers on and disks whine, it's probably fine so far.

, Even if it had no problems in step 2, open the case. You need to do a few things in here. If it didn't power on at all, look at the power connectors from the PSU to motherboard. If they're connected properly, then there's probably something wrong with the PSU or motherboard, and unless you have replacements available, this computer isn't worth it. If not, connect them properly. Look at the disk drive connectors. Are they upside down? Is a drive's pin setting not correct? Correct it.

, Using compressed air, dust out the case. Dust the motherboard, cards, disk drives, power supply, any fans (especially the CPU fan on the motherboard), and the case around everything. Remember to hold the fans while cleaning them, so you don't break them.

, If the CD-ROM drive does not work, remove it. If the sound card is broken, remove it. If the graphics card is broken, remove it (and get another). If the CMOS battery needs replacement, replace it.

, If there were broken RAM, it's especially important that you replace them. If the hard disk was faulty, it's also important. However, if the 56k modem wasn't working, you probably don't need to worry about it, as you will probably upgrade in the next step (don't replace anything you'll be upgrading).

, If things can be upgraded, upgrade them. Upgrade the computer as far as possible. Upgrade RAM, hard disk(s), if you can, upgrade from CD-ROM to DVD, and if there was a 56k modem, upgrade it to gigabit ethernet or a wi-fi card, etc. Read Build a Computer for instructions on working inside the case.

, Make sure all the above steps have worked. Power it on and make sure you can boot to BIOS and can configure all of the hard disks (with an exception to some computers such as the Compaq Deskpro 2000, which do not allow you to access the BIOS directly).

, Use a modern Operating System for better features and security.


1 GB+ of RAM (Minimum) Windows 7.
512MB of RAM (Minimum) Ubuntu, Windows XP and Windows Vista.
256MB of RAM (Minimum) Xubuntu.
128MB of RAM (Minimum) Lubuntu.

, Not especially important, but installing software can make it more useful to you or make it more appealing to buyers.

, Find at least a power cord, keyboard, mouse, and maybe a monitor, and include them. Include whatever you have left from when you bought it (if you don't need it). If you have more, try including speakers, printers, a modem, a joystick, software disks, etc.

, A good computer from the mid to late 90's could probably sell for anything between $10 and $50. Find out how much you spent on it, then add your price for labor. So, say you spent 5 hours working on this computer at $2 an hour, and spent $15 on it in all (including buying the computer, unless you are the original owner), and you want to add an extra $5. Adding them together would be $30, so sell your computer for that, but be sure it's worth it. No one wants to buy a computer with only 16 megabytes of RAM running Windows 3.1 for $30.

, The only way that all that work will be worth it is if you use it. So, sit down and play a few old games, run some older software that was rejected by Windows 7, give it to your kids, use it as a router, take it to school with you, etc.

Close any unused programs.,
Reboot the computer.,
Run anti-virus software.,
Check the hard drive for errors.,
Change the software version to 32-bit or 64-bit based on your computer’s specifications.The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the number of calculations the CPU can make at the same time.,
Try operating system specific solutions.",How to Reduce CPU Usage1," The easiest way to reduce your CPU usage is to close programs that you aren’t using.Close resource heavy software programs such as 3D games, the Adobe Creative Suite, the Microsoft Office Suite, web browsers with flash video or games, 3D modeling tools, and audio editing tools.
Keep in mind the downside to this method is it won’t help you to discover what software programs are using the most resources.;
, If your computer has been on for several days, it may begin to run more slowly over time.

, If your computer is running slowly even with no applications running, you may want to run anti-virus software to determine whether your system has a virus.Keep in mind anti-virus software can also use a large amount of a system’s resources.
In a search engine, search for your specific operating system and anti-virus software to get a list of anti-virus software compatible with your computer.

, Over time, your computer can create errors on your hard drive. Both Windows and Mac operating systems have system tools for checking your hard drive for errors.Click this link for Windows 8 instructions on how to run a hard drive diagnostic: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/improve-performance-optimizing-hard-drive

Click this link for Mac instructions on how to use the Disk Utility tool: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201639


, There is a significant difference between 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs, and if you try to run a software program intended for a 64-bit CPU on a 32-bit computer, the program won’t work well, if it all.Many contemporary software programs have 32-bit and 64-bit versions. If a software program is running slowly, try the 32-bit version of the software program.
Sometimes downloading the most up-to-date version of a software program will cause it to run better.

, If you’ve tried all of these options, but your computer is still running slowly, try these operating system specific methods.

Open the Windows Task Manager.,
Review application CPU usage.,
Review the computer processes’ CPU usage.,
End the CPU processes.",How to Reduce CPU Usage2," On Windows, the Windows Task Manager software program will list everything using the CPU.


Right-click the taskbar, and then click Start Task Manager.

, In the Windows Task Manager, click the Applications tab. In the Applications list, in the header row, click CPU to sort the applications by CPU usage.


The CPU column number is the percentage of the CPU that an application is using.
The amount of the CPU that a program is using at any given time changes depending on what you’re trying to do. For example, a 3D modeling program will use far more of a computer’s CPU resources when it’s rendering a 3D animation, than when it’s sitting idle.
The programs using a large amount of the CPU when idle are the ones that you’ll want to close when you’re not using them. You can close an application in the Windows Task Manager by clicking the End Process button, but it’s usually better to exit the application from within the application.
If a program is stuck or hanging, the Windows Task Manager is a good way to force a program to quit.

, Click the Processes tab. This shows all of the processes running on your computer and their CPU usage. In the header, click CPU to sort the processes by their CPU usage.It’s not always obvious from the process name in the Image Name column what a process is. The Description column can provide additional information.
If you don’t know what a process is doing, even though it might be using a lot of the CPU, it’s best not to end the process, because it may be an important system process. You can use a search engine, such as Google, to learn more about specific processes.

Send your computer back to a manufacturer.,
Even if you have not recently purchased a computer, you may still be able to send your old computer back to a manufacturer.,
Take your computer to a nearby recycling center.,
Donate your computer to a charity.,
In the UK the charity Computer Aid International wipes the hard drives of all donated computers, free of charge, to US military standards.",How to Recycle a Computer," If you have recently purchased a new computer, you may be able to send your old computer back to a manufacturer. Many computer manufacturers, including Apple, HP and Dell, offer programs that allow you to mail your old computer to them for free, which they will then recycle, if you have recently purchased one of their products.;
, However, it could cost you some money. For example, Dell offers a program that allows you to send them your computer after selecting a $10 or $20 computer recycling kit. HP requests that you provide them with information about your computer, your location, etc. and will then send you a quote. Some manufacturers may require you to pay for shipping and handling, but the fees are typically reasonable.

, Chances are that there is a computer recycling center or program in your area. Visit the Consumer Education Initiative to find computer recycling centers near you. These recycling centers will typically take more than just computers too, so if you have any other electronics that you'd like to get rid of, check to see if you can recycle them at your computer recycling center as well.

, The ultimate way to recycle your computer, if it's still working, is to donate it to a local charity or school. Then you know that someone will be re-using your computer, instead of just its parts and/or materials. Donating your working computer can make a big difference in someone's life.


The National Cristina Foundation,for example, maintains a list of non-profit groups, schools and public agencies throughout the US that are in need of used computer equipment. NCF donates the used computers it receives to ""organizations train people with disabilities, students at risk and economically disadvantaged persons to lead more independent and productive lives.""

Know when to use this method.,
Frame the TV completely in the camera.,
Avoid using the zoom.,
Connect the audio to the camera (if possible).,
Dim the lights.,
Use a tripod or other stabilizer.,
Sit to the side while playing.,
Transfer the finished video to your computer for editing and uploading.",How to Record Video Gameplay With No Capture Card4," If you are trying to record gameplay from an older console without a capture card, your best bet may be using a video camera or your smartphone's camera app. You won't get perfect quality, but you'll still be able to record what you're playing.


If you're using a smartphone, you'll have trouble picking up the sound from your TV.
If you can, consider purchasing a capture device instead. These are external devices that you simply plug into your computer, making them much easier to install than a capture card. You will be able to record at the best picture and sound quality if you use a capture device.
If you're playing a much older system, such as an NES or Sega Genesis, you may want to record with a VCR. This will lead to a better quality recording, and with the right equipment you can transfer it to a computer.

, The key to a good recording is to ensure that the entire frame is filled with the TV image. Try to position the camera in such as way that it is looking directly at the TV, and that the frame is filled by the TV image. Move the camera a little closer so that the edges of the TV are just barely cut off. This will ensure that the entire frame is full.


Make sure that you aren't pointed at an angle, or you'll likely pick up some glare.

, If your video camera or smartphone uses digital zoom, avoid using it for filming your gameplay. Digital zoom will result in a blurry final video, and you need as much clarity as possible when filming this way.

, If you're using a camcorder, you may be able to route the game audio through the camcorder's input. You'll need a converter for the console's audio cable so that it can plug into the input or line-in option on the camcorder. This isn't possible on most smartphones.


Another possibility with a camcorder is setting up a microphone next to your TV speaker to pick up the game audio more clearly.

, Make sure that no lights are shining directly onto the TV screen. You don't want to make the room completely dark, or the TV image will glow too much. As long as lights aren't pointing directly at the TV screen or camera, you should be good.

, The worst thing you can do for clarity is to try to hold the camera while the game plays. Your camera needs to be absolutely steady, or it will be very hard to see the gameplay. Use a tripod if possible. If you don't have a tripod, set the camera or phone on a level surface and stabilize it with books or other heavy objects.

, When the screen is dark, you may appear in the TV reflection if you are sitting directly in front. Sit off to the side while recording so that you don't get caught in the reflection.

, Once you're finished recording, transfer the video to your computer so that you can edit anything out that you don't want in the video. This is usually useful to cut out the setup process or to remove boring parts. Since the sound recording probably wasn't very good, you may want to replace the sound completely with a soundtrack. After you're finished making your edits, you can upload the video to YouTube or keep it on your computer

What you will need to do.,
Get a recliner generally called a Lazy Boy of the type used by Frasier's father's (TV show).,
The chair may be set in a permanent reclining position or adjusted with each sitting.,
This system takes a little work but is worth it to be pain free.,
The board may be finish grade fir, 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 8 inches (20.3 cm) or 1"" x 8"", where the keyboard is 7 inches (17.8 cm) in width.,
The monitor is set on a table adjusted to a height easy on the eyes with one's head rested against the back of the chair.,
The mouse pad should be placed on a table to the right or left of the chair, as close as possible to the arm.,
For people with mouse associated problems around the shoulders and neck, one can have mouse stands on both sides of the chair and switch the mouse to either side, assuming one learns to use both hands with the same mouse setting, and not having to change right/left handed system settings each time.,
Finished.

",How to Recline and Use a Computer,"


Obtain a recliner.
Cut a board to hold the keyboard.
Obtain a table to hold the monitor.
Obtain table to hold the mouse pad.
Obtain table to hold keyboard.;
, It reclines to a number of set degrees and a lever raises a leg and foot rest. Degree of recline must lock in place. These may be found sometimes in thrift stores. Keep in mind that new furniture often contains chemicals adverse to the nervous system. If you can recline in one of these chairs with your feet up without pain this system maybe for you. Separately a locking recliner with independent foot and leg rest may be less expensive and more efficient.

, If permanent, with the Lazy Boy one may have to step over and between the leg rest brackets each time getting in and out. In this case the separate leg rest would be better.

, One needs to make a board to sit across the arms of the chair, to hold the keyboard. When the chair is in recline, the arms of the chair and thus the keyboard take an angle of about 35 or 40 degrees. The idea here is to keep the elbows resting on the arms, whether one types or uses the mouse. One needs a keyboard that has the little legs that snap out to hook over the further side of the board, to keep the keyboard from sliding down.


The keyboard should be able to slide back and fourth on the board for precise adjustment.

, A wider board may obtained and cut down lengthwise for special accommodation or customized in any way. One may want to round off and sand edges.


The length of the board should be from half-way across the width of the left arm pad to to half-way across the width of the right arm pad, which could be 28 inches (71.1 cm).
Then at each end of the board, 2 inch (5.1 cm) C clamps are screwed in place, screw lever up, which hooks on the ends of the arms, to keep the board from sliding down.
The placement of the C Clamps can be used to adjust the distance of the board away from the body, but must be at least two thirds of the way towards the further edge to keep the board from tipping over. The length of the chair arm should probably be around 18 inches (45.7 cm).
The keyboard wire may need an extension, depending on the distance from the computer, and may be looped through a C clamp at one end to keep it draped over the side of the arm.
This contrivance must be slipped in whole or part over to a side table when one gets up.

, A nice distance may be about 4 feet (1.2 m), adjusted to either side of the leg rest or feet. However it may be necessary to enlarge the system fonts, which is easier on eyes in any event.

, It should be about exactly the same height as the high point of the end of the chair arm when in recline position and at a distance so that one can pivot from the elbow, one's arm and hand from the keyboard to mouse and back, without the elbow leaving the arm of the chair, and also so as one does not have to reach. One can shim the pad base to the proper level. Using the side away from any leg rest lever may be no problem. However access to the lever may be impaired by the placement of the mouse base. A table with an extended top might be obtained so that one can reach under to the lever.


An extension for the mouse might be required.

,


This system may seem a little funky, but has been used for 6 years with complete success. One may be able to improve on the system to suit oneself.

There are lots of great free stuff offers out there, but you need to use some healthy skepticism and resist the temptation to fall for free stuff scams and matrix programs.;
, Just take it as a given that spammers have nothing of value to offer, so when someone emails you offering something for free, chances are it's a scam. Variations of the advance fee scam like the email from Nigeria, saying they want to use your bank account to get money out of the country is on the rise. Just delete these without hesitation or a second thought.

, If you get an email or postal mail proclaiming that you are the winner of a great prize and all you have to do is pay a fee to claim it, don't. It's a scam and the only winners are the scammers.

, These offers are generally OK as long as the shipping and handling fees are reasonable and you get something of value. $4.95 for a CD-ROM you are interested in is fine, but $4.95 for a cell phone antenna booster (which does not work no matter what they tell you) is a waste of money.

, Most of the sites that consist of nothing but a form offering free stuff are there to collect email addresses for spammers.

Use this information to troubleshoot.",How to Read Dump Files1," Most users will only need dump files to determine what caused a system crash or Blue Screen of Death. BlueScreenView is a freeware utility from NirSoft that can analyze dump files and tell you which driver or other factor caused your crash.


The dumps created during a system crash are referred to as ""minidumps."";
, You can download BlueScreenView directly from NirSoft at nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html.


You can download the program as a standalone, which comes in ZIP format. This will allow you to run it without installing it. Once you finish downloading the ZIP file, right-click it and select ""Extract"" to create a new folder with the BlueScreenView program.

, After extracting BlueScreenView from the ZIP file, launch the program inside. You'll be prompted to continue by Windows.

, When your computer crashes, a file called a ""minidump"" is created in the Windows directory. These files have a .dmp extension, and BlueScreenView can read them and tell you what happened. Minidump files can be found at C:\Windows\Minidump. If you don't see the files, you may need to enable hidden files:In Windows 10 and 8, click the ""View"" tab in Windows Explorer and check the ""Hidden items"" box.
In Windows 7 and earlier, open Folder Options from the Control Panel, click the ""View"" tab, and then select ""Show hidden files, folders, and drives.""

, The quickest way to open .dmp files is to simply drag them into the window. The file will not be moved from its original location. You'll the the lower half of the BlueScreenView window fill with data after dragging the file into the window.

, You may have to scroll to the right a bit to see it. This column will display the driver that caused the system crash.


You can also find the problematic driver highlighted in red in the lower section of the window. Double-click this highlighted entry to see more details, such as the product name, description, and path., Now that you know what driver caused the crash, you can begin troubleshooting it. Start with a web search for ""driver name crash"" to see if others have experienced your problem.

Lookup BugCheck codes.",How to Read Dump Files2," Most users won't need to use the Windows Debugger program to open MEMORY.DMP files and examine the code dumped from memory when the system crashed. If you want to learn more about how Windows uses drivers and memory, or if you need to analyze dump files for development, Windows Debugger can give you a lot of information.

, This program contains the WinDBG program that you'll be using to open the dump files. You can download the WDK installer here.

, This will start the installer. Proceed through the first few screens leaving them at their defaults.

, You can deselect all of the other features as they won't be used to open dump files. Deselecting them will save you installation time and hard disk space.

, This may take a few minutes to complete.

, You'll need to open an elevated Command Prompt in order to associate .dmp files with WinDBG so that it can analyze them. You'll start Command Prompt in the ""system32"" folder.


Windows 10 and 8 - Right-click the Windows button and select ""Command Prompt (Admin).""
Windows 7 - Open the Start menu and type cmd. Press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+↵ Enter.

, Enter the following command to move to the correct directory. If you're using Windows 10, you can copy and paste it. Earlier versions will require you to type it out:


cd\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Debuggers\x64\

, Enter the following command to associate WinDBG with .dmp files. Windows 10 users can copy and paste this command:


windbg.exe -IA
If you entered the command correctly, an empty WinDBG window will appear, which you can close.

, You'll need to configure WinDBG to load the proper files from Microsoft to open .dmp files. You'll do this from within WinDBG.


The quickest way to launch the program is to press ⊞ Win and type ""windbg.""

, This will open a new window.

, This path will tell WinDBG to download the necessary symbols directly from Microsoft, and to store them at C:\SymCache:SRV*C:\SymCache*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
Your C:\SymCache folder will grow over time as you open more debug files and additional symbols are downloaded from Microsoft.

, Dump (.dmp) files are generated when your system crashes. By default, you should be able to find the dump file in the C:\Windows\Minidump directory after recovering from a crash. The file may also be C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP. If you can't find the files, you may have to enable hidden files:


In Windows 10 and 8, click the ""View"" tab in Windows Explorer and check the ""Hidden items"" box.
In Windows 7 and earlier, open Folder Options from the Control Panel, click the ""View"" tab, and then select ""Show hidden files, folders, and drives.""

, As long as you configured WinDBG properly following the steps above, WinDBG should launch and begin processing the file.

, The first time you open a dump file, you'll need to wait while the symbols are downloaded from Microsoft. Do not interrupt the WinDBG program as it loads the file.


The dump file will load much quicker on subsequent openings since you'll already have the symbols in your C:\SymCache folder.
You'll know the dump file has finished loading when you see Followup: MachineOwner at the bottom of the file.

, This is the quickest way to get an idea of what caused the crash. WinDBG will analyze the dump file and report what dirver or process likely caused the problem. You can use this information to do deeper troubleshooting and research.

, The dump file will return codes for specific bugs encountered during the crash. Look for these directly above the ""Probably caused by"" line. You'll typically see a two-character code, such as ""9F.""


Visit the Microsoft Bug Check Code Reference. Find the code that matches you BugCode by looking at the last two characters in each entry."

Download and install Fraps.,
Adjust your recording settings.,
Start your game.,
Convert your video.,
Share your video.",How to Record Movies of PC Games Using Fraps," Fraps is available for free from the developer’s website. The free version will allow you to record for 30 seconds, and will place a watermark on the recorded footage. Once you’ve downloaded the free version, run the Setup file and follow any instructions.


The default installation settings should be acceptable for most users.;
, Click the Movies tab to configure the Fraps video recording. In this tab, you will be able to adjust several options:


Choose the folder that you want to save your recordings by using the top field. Click the Change button to browse for a new folder.
Set your recording hotkey by changing the Video Capture Hotkey. By default this is set to F9. Pressing the hotkey during a game will start and stop recording.
Choose your capture settings. Fraps will cause a noticeable drop in performance, and the drop will increase as you increase the FPS (frames per second) of your recorded footage. The ability to record at high FPS is determined by the power of your computer.

Play around with different options until you find one that gives you good quality while still allowing you to play your game comfortably.


Choose whether or not to record the sound. If you are going to be using different audio in your finished video, you can uncheck the “Record sound” box to keep your file size down.

, Once you have Fraps correctly configured, start your PC game as you normally would. Once you get to the point where you want to start recording, press the hotkey you specified (F9 by default). Fraps will display the FPS in the corner of your display. Once you are finished recording, press the hotkey again.


Your new video file will be saved at the location you set in the Movies tab.

, The AVI file created by Fraps will likely be quite large. Use a program such as HandBrake or Windows Movie Maker to convert the movie into a smaller, more portable format, such as MP4

, Once you’ve converted your video, all that’s left is to share it with the world. You could upload it to YouTube, or burn it to a DVD. Edit multiple clips together with music and transitions to create a highlight reel of your best moments.

Bind the end caps to the ear buds with glue.,
Bind a loop of the earbud cable to the earbud with some sewing thread to keep the cord from getting pulled out of your buds.,
Accidentally dunking an earbud in a mug or a cup is another problem and there just a fair chance that your earbuds will work later.",How to Protect Your Earbuds," The end caps are very easy to pop off and when they do come off, damaging the little wires inside will render your ear bud useless.;
,


With a file or a knife, nick the section, that the thread will be wrapped on, so the thread will not slide down.
To keep the thread in place, try melting a groove in the plastic with a hot, wand iron or a hot knife.
To further solidify the thread wrapping, paint over it with nail polish, floor wax, varnish, or fabric glue.
If you have not fortified the cord to the earbud, handle the earbud in the proper way. When removing it, even when in a hurry, do not yank on the cord, instead grasp the earbud (not the cord).

,


Put a little post-it at your desk with the message: ""Do Not Drop Earbuds in Mug"".
Artist types - draw a mug with earbuds over it and put and X over the picture.
If you do drop your earbuds in liquid: 1) disconnect the earbuds immediately,and 2) Do not reconnect it until after you have extracted the liquid and your earbuds are totally dry. See articles on reviving a wet cellphone and where a little vacuum cleaner is used to extract the water.

The ports you need to open are different for every program, so check the support documentation to figure out which ports need to be opened.;
, If your computer is connected to a router, it is most likely using the router's firewall to protect ports. If you want to open ports, you will need to open your router's configuration page. You can access your router from any computer attached to your network.


Type in the router's address into your web browser's address bar. The address is typically 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1. You can find your specific router's address by opening the command prompt, typing ipconfig and looking for the Default Gateway.
You will be asked for a username and password. The default username is typically ""admin"" and the password is usually ""password"" or ""admin"". You can find the login information for your specific router by searching the model online.
If you are having difficulty accessing the router, press the reset button on the back of the router and wait 30 seconds, then turn it back on. This will reset the settings to default. You can then use the login information printed on the router itself or look up the defaults online.

, The location of this option will vary from router to router, but it is typically located in the Advanced menu. It is sometimes called the ""Forwarding"" section or the ""Applications and Gaming"" section, and may be under the ""NAT"" menu.

, This process will vary depending on your router, but generally you will be entering the same information. You may need to click ""Add Custom Service"" or ""Create Rule"" in order to make a new entry. You will need several different pieces of information to open ports.


IP Address - This is the IP address of the device that you want to forward ports for. For example, if you want to forward ports for your laptop, you will need its IP. See this guide for instructions on finding your IP for a PC, and this guide for finding the IP address for a Mac.
Starting port and ending port - This is the range of ports you are opening. Some programs will require a range of ports, while other will require a single port. If you are only opening one port, enter the same number for the Starting and Ending ports. If you have the option to set the Internal Port range, use the same numbers.
Protocol - You have a choice between TCP and UDP. The one required will typically be given to you by the program that you are unblocking ports for, but if you are unsure choose the ""Both"" or ""TCP/UDP"" option.

, Once you've entered in all the information you need, click the Save or Apply button. Your router will save the changes, which may take a few moments. After its done, the ports you specified will now be open for the IP address that you entered.

Generic desktop computers need to be opened using screwdrivers. However, certain brands have buttons or knobs you can use to open the computer case. This eliminates the need for tools, making the process much easier.

If you have a dell GX260 or GX270 desktop, you do not need to remove any screws to open the case. There are two buttons you press and then lift the case to open. If you have a tower case, there are also usually buttons. HP D510 small form desktops also have buttons you can use to remove the case.If you have an HP D510 tower desktop, there are tiny knobs on the back you unscrew. You will not need a screwdriver or other tools to open the desktop case. An HP D50 small form desktop also has knobs you unscrew. A screwdriver or other tools are not required for these desktops.A Dell Dimension 8200 Desktop has a button you press to open the case. Make sure to lay this kind of computer on its side, with the CD drives and front of the computer facing downward, before opening.;
, If you have a generic desktop that requires tools for opening, first get your tools together. Proper tools will allow you to open the case safely.

You will usually need a screwdriver, usually a Philips head. However, check what kind of screws your desktop uses and purchase the proper screwdriver based on your computer.You will need antistatic strapping, which is a type of material you can find at a local hardware store. This material is designed to remove electric charge from your fingers when handling the inside of a computer. You can also touch the unpainted metal portion of a computer case to remove static charge if you can't find strapping. However, antistatic strapping is the best option for safety purposes., Before you begin working on a computer, you'll need to prepare your hands. Your hands should be clean before you begin working on a computer, so wash thoroughly. You should also make sure your hands are completely dry. This is very important, as wet hands can lead to electric shock. Remove any jewelry from your hands before working on a computer., Once you've prepared your hands, unscrew the case. Remember, check your type of computer first. It's possible you do not need to unscrew anything. However, if you have a generic laptop without buttons, locate the screws you need to remove. Always unplug the computer before you try to open the case.

You should consult your owner's manual first. It will have specific instructions based on your laptop. It should include pictures and diagrams that indicate which screws need to be removed if you're opening the desktop case.If you can't find your owner's manual, you'll usually need to open a computer in a way that allows you to access the motherboard. This usually means opening the computer on the side opposite of where plugs are inserted into the computer. Unscrew the plugs on this side, and then gently lift the case off of the computer. Set it aside somewhere safe while you work on or clean the computer., As you work, you'll need to discharge any static built up on your hands. This lessens the likelihood of injuring yourself or harming the computer. Occasionally touch the antistatic strap as you work. If you do not have an antistatic strap, touch the unpainted metal portion of a computer case.It's very important you remove static electricity from your hands as you work. Static electricity can harm vital portions of the computer, like its memory, motherboard, and video card., If you're trying to set up a new computer, the first step is to remove the computer from the box. Do this in a safe area. It may be a good idea to remove the computer from the box somewhere low to the ground to minimize damage in the event you drop the computer.Make sure to remove any plastic wrap on the computer. The monitor may have a layer of plastic wrap over the screen that needs removal before you can use the computer safely.Place your computer and monitor in the area where you'll be working. You want to find a well-ventilated area to prevent overheating., Once you've removed your computer from the box, you can begin set up. To start, you'll need to connect the monitor cable.


There is no single kind of monitor cable. Their appearance varies by size and shape depending on your type of computer. The monitor cable may be labeled in its packaging. You can also consult your owner's manual to find an image of the proper cable.Once you find the cable, connect it to the back of your computer. You should be able to tell, based on the plug's shape, which portal the cable goes into. If there are screws around this portal, tighten them by hand., From here, you should set up the keyboard. The keyboard will usually be in the box your computer came in, so you'll need to unwrap it first and remove any plastic wrap. From there, see what kind of connector it uses.

Keyboards may use a USB connector, which is a rectangular connect. USB connectors are generally plugged in on any USB ports found on the back of the computer.Keyboards can also use round connectors, referred to as PS/2 connectors. These connectors are plugged into a purple port found on the back of a computer., Next, plug in your mouse. Like the keyboard, it may be packaged and wrapped, so remove any plastic wrap accordingly. A mouse will also either use a PS/2 or USB connector. PS/2 connectors are plugged into the green portal in the back of the computer. USB connectors are plugged into any USB port found on the back of the computer., If you have speakers of headphones you want to install, you can do so after setting up the keyboard and mouse. These are usually connected to the audio port, found on the front or back of a computer case.Some audio ports are color coded. A green port is where you would connect a headphones. A microphone would be connected using a pink port. The blue port would is used for any other type of device, such as speakers., Once you have everything plugged into the ports, you can now plug in your computer. Most desktop computers come with two power supply cables.


Plug the first power supply cable into the back of a computer case. Then, plug it into a surge protector. Use the other cable to connect your monitor with your computer.When you're done, you can plug the surge protector into the wall. If you do not have a surge protector, you can plug the computer directly into the wall. However, this is not recommended as electrical surges can cause potential damage to your computer., Once everything is connected, turn your computer on. If you connected everything correctly, your computer should start up without trouble. If your computer does not turn on, go back and double check to make sure everything is plugged in correctly. If you're still having trouble, call the help number listed on the manufacturer's instructions. Someone at Tech Support can help you sort out the issue.

Archive emails.",How to Organize a Virtual Workspace," Having a cluttered desktop does compare to having reams of unorganized papers all over a physical desk, but it also makes your system run slower and contributes to vast inefficiency. Take the time to clean up the desktop periodically for a cleaner and more organized look for your workstation.


Some software providers are offering special tools to the busy professional for hiding desktop clutter. These virtual desktop tools can help when it's time for a presentation, and the presenter's desktop is still covered with a maze of icons.;
, For those freelancers or others with many clients, creating a client package can help to organize a client list without a database. Simply create a dossier template and fill one file with information on a particular client, then keep the files in clearly labeled folders.

, Scanning paper documents and placing them in the right folders will help the harried manager to have more of the essential paperwork in the same place, within an organized digital desk.

, When it comes to organizing files, good naming is key. The more deliberate a file naming system is, the more the worker can do to bring up those files when he or she needs them the most.


Use alphabetical order. Alphabetizing file names will help the computer do most of the work for you when it comes to looking for a particular document.
Make use of file prefixes and suffixes. Prefixes can come in handy for labeling files by client, and suffixes can show you the status of a particular file. Again, consistency is key.

, Having the ability to send and receive digital faxes will also add to the power of an organized virtual workstation.

, When it comes to all of the essential communications that the average manager takes part in during the day, it's best not to trust all of this information to a free web-hosted email provider. Backing up emails can be one of the most important things that a busy worker does to make sure key information is always at hand.


Look for pay web-hosting programs. Paying companies to host email gives workers peace of mind that the emails are stored on a failsafe database and not subject to the whims of providers. Contractual details can provide for more guarantees on email archiving.

Select a transformer.,
Wire the primary winding of the transformer to the main AC supply.,
Connect the secondary winding of the transformer to a full wave bridge rectifier package.,
Attach a smoothing capacitor.,
Provide the final regulation.",How to Make an AC DC Converter," A transformer contains 2 magnetically coupled wire windings. One winding is called the primary. The primary is driven by the main AC supply. The other winding is called the secondary. The secondary serves as the power input to the AC DC converter. This transformer and all of the other items needed to build the AC DC converter are readily available at electronic stores and hobby stores.


Size the transformer windings. AC mains provide 120 volts AC. If 120 volts AC were directly converted to a DC voltage, the resulting DC voltage would be far too high a voltage for use by appliances and devices. The primary and secondary windings of the transformer are scaled to each other in order to produce a lower voltage on the secondary winding.
Choose a secondary winding. The AC output of the secondary winding should be rated as the same voltage of DC that is being created.;
, This transformer connection has no polarity and may be connected either way.

, The transformer connections and the connections to the marked inputs of the rectifier package have no polarity and may be connected either way.


Build a full wave rectifier. This rectifier can be built up from 4 discrete rectifying diodes, rather than using a rectifier bridge package. The diodes will be marked to show a positive (cathode) end and a negative (anode) end. Connect the 4 diodes into a loop. Connect the cathode of diode 1 to the cathode of diode 2. Connect the anode of diode 2 to the cathode of diode 3. Connect the anode of diode 3 to the anode of diode 4. Connect the cathode of diode 4 to the anode of diode 1.
Wire the discrete rectifier to the transformer secondary. The transformer secondary should be connected to the cathode of diode 3 and the cathode of diode 4. There is no required polarity for these connections. The positive output of the rectifier is at the point where the cathodes of diodes 1 and 2 join. The negative output of the rectifier is at the point where the anodes of diodes 3 and 4 join.

, Attach a polarized capacitor across the output connections of the rectifier. The positive terminal of the polarized capacitor must connect to the positive output of the regulator. This capacitor should be sized such that the capacitance in farads (F) is equal to (5 times the current to be supplied by the AC DC converter) divided by (transformer secondary rating times 1.4 times frequency). Frequency varies from country to country, but is typically either 50 Hertz (Hz) or 60 Hertz.

, Choose a commercially available voltage regulator designed to control the output of the AC DC converter to the desired output voltage. The regulator will be a 3-pin device. The regulator pins will be a common, an input from the smoothing capacitor and an output of the regulator. This regulator output also will be the final output of the completed AC DC converter.


Wire the regulator as directed in the manufacturer's data sheet. There probably will be a noise suppression capacitor specified in the regulator manufacturer's data sheet. Acquire and install that capacitor per the manufacturer's data sheet for the regulator.

Allow your flash capacitor to charge.,
Activate your flash capacitor.",How to Make an Electromagnetic Pulse1," To create a simple electromagnetic pulse, you will need a disposable camera, copper wire, rubber gloves, solder and soldering tools, and an iron rod. These components can be found at your local hardware store.


The thicker gauge copper wire you use in this experiment, the more powerful your electromagnetic pulse will be.
In the event an iron rod is not available to you, you can use a non-metal rod as a substitute. However, a non-metal rod will have a negative impact on the strength of your EMP.
When working with electrical components that could be holding a charge, or when running electrical current through an object, it is recommended you wear rubber gloves to prevent any errant shocks to yourself.;
, An electromagnetic coil is a device that is made up of two distinct yet integral parts: a conductor and a core.In this case, your iron rod will be your core and your copper wire the conductor.









Wrap your copper wire tightly around your core, leaving little to no gaps in your windings.You should leave excess wire at the beginning and end of your winding so that you can connect your coil to your flash capacitor.

, A capacitor is generally a double pronged, cylindrical shaped component found on most circuit boards.Your disposable camera should have a capacitor for its flash.Be sure that the battery of your disposable camera is removed before attempting to solder the ends of your coil to the capacitor, or else you could get a nasty shock.









Wearing rubber gloves can save you from getting an electric jolt while handling your camera circuit and flash capacitor.
Expend the charge in your capacitor by engaging the flash after removing the batteries from your camera. Any stored charge in your camera can result in an electrical shock., Depending on the materials you have used, the effective range of your EMP shouldn't be more than a few feet in any direction. Be that as it may, any electronics caught in your EMP may be permanently destroyed.Keep in mind that EMPs indiscriminately influence electronics. This includes life-supporting devices, like pacemakers, and valuables like cellular phones. Any damage you cause to these devices through your EMP could result in legal repercussions.
A grounded platform, like a tree stump or plastic table, is an ideal testing surface for your EMP emitter.

, Since the electromagnetic pulse field will only affect electronics, you may want to buy an inexpensive electronic device from your local electronics store. If your electronic device ceases function after your EMP, you have successfully created an electromagnetic pulse.


Many office supply stores have affordable electronic calculators that you can use to test your EMP.

, You will need electricity to re-charge your capacitor, which will then provide the current to your electromagnetic coil and create your EMP. Be sure you have placed your test object close to your EMP emitter.


Electromagnetic fields are, in most cases, invisible to the eye.If you don't have a test object, even if you have successfully created an EMP, you may not know it.

, You can do this by removing the wires from the electromagnetic coil, allowing the current from the battery to feed into the capacitor, and then with an insulated manipulator (like rubber gloves or plastic tongs), reattach the wires of your coil to your capacitor. Using your bare hands could result in a taser-like zap.








, By activating the flash of your camera, you will release the stored electricity in it, which will surge through your electromagnetic coil and create your EMP.









The nature of the EMP field you are creating will affect any electronics, even those that are switched off. If you have chosen a calculator as your test object, after activating your capacitor, if your EMP has worked, the calculator will not turn on.
Depending on the kind of flash capacitor you have used, the voltage required to charge your capacitor will be variable. The approximate capacitance for a disposable camera should be between 80-160 microfarads, and the voltage will likely be between 180-330 volts."

Electrical tape
Iron core (circular shaped preferred)
Rubber gloves (recommended)
Simple electrical switch
Solder and soldering iron
Walkie-talkie antenna, Inside your disposable camera, you will see a main circuit board that controls the functions of your camera. Remove the batteries first, and then remove the circuit board, taking note of the position of the flash capacitor.Wearing rubber gloves can save you from getting an electric jolt while handling your camera circuit and flash capacitor.
Capacitors generally look like cylinders attached to the circuit board with two prongs. This will be a necessary component for you EMP device.
Expend the charge in your capacitor by engaging the flash after removing the batteries from your camera. Any stored charge in your camera can result in an electrical shock.

, Be sure that you have an adequate length of copper wire; your wrap should evenly and completely cover your iron core. You should also wrap your wire tightly, as a loose winding will negatively impact your EMP.Leave some excess copper wire at the ends of your winding. You will need this to connect the rest of your EMP device to your electromagnetic coil.

, You walkie-talkie antenna will serve as the stock onto which you fix your electromagnetic coil and camera circuit board. Wrap the base end of your walkie-talkie antenna with electrical tape as a preventative measure for being shocked.

, Your cardboard will serve as another insulator to prevent any unpleasant electrical shocks. Use your electrical tape, taking care not to cover any of the electric pathways of your camera circuit, and attach it to your piece of cardboard.


You'll want to attach your camera circuit face up so that the capacitor and its connection pathways aren't interfered with by the cardboard.
Your cardboard mount for your camera circuit should have some additional space for your AA holder.

, Since current will be running through your coil to create your EMP, it's a good idea to double insulate your antenna by putting another small piece of cardboard between your coil and the antenna. You can then use your electrical tape to attach your coil to the cardboard.

, Find the battery connector tabs on your camera circuit and connect them to the corresponding positive and negative ends of your AA battery holder.This can then be attached to a free space on your cardboard camera circuit mount with electrical tape.

, The excess wire that you left at the beginning and end of your copper wire winding will need to be soldered to the electrodes of your flash capacitor. To control the flow of electricity between your capacitor and electromagnetic coil, you should tie in your electrical switch between these two components.You should wear rubber gloves during this portion of your EMP device assembly. Any remaining charge in your capacitor could shock you.

, Use your electrical tape to firmly attach your cardboard mount and its component to your antenna. You should attach your mount above the base of your antenna, which you should have already insulated with electrical tape.

, A simple, inexpensive calculator is ideal for testing your handheld EMP device. Depending on the materials and technique you used in the construction of your device, the range of your EMP field may include only the immediate vicinity of your coil, or it may reach up to several feet around the coil.


Any electronics caught in your EMP could be permanently damaged. Make sure you have chosen a location far enough away from electronics that you don't inadvertently do harm. You could be liable for any damage you cause with your EMP.

, Check that the switch for your device is set to off, and then install your batteries in to the AA battery holder on your cardboard mount. Grasping your EMP device by the insulated base of the antenna, like a Ghostbuster Neutron Wand, hold your electromagnetic coil toward your test object and flick your switch to the ""On"" position.


If you are not confident in your knowledge or construction of electrical components, you may want to wear a pair of rubber glove when operating your device, as an added precaution.
If your device has successfully worked, your test object, and any other electronics caught in your EMP field, will not turn on.
Depending on the kind of flash capacitor you have used, the voltage required to charge your capacitor will be variable. The approximate capacitance for a disposable camera should be between 80-160 microfarads, and the voltage will likely be between 180-330 volts."

Understand that responsive design is about priority.,
Research the audience to find out how they view the website.,
Design different layouts for different devices.,
Adjust the layout for the different devices.,
Ensure that media is reasonably-sized.,
Account for different types of interaction.",How to Make a Website Responsive," Because all websites have far more content than can be reasonably displayed on a single screen, every website needs to choose the most important bits of information to show at a given time. The home page, for example, always needs to show the right amount of information that the visitor should see first.


Responsive websites need even more careful prioritising because visitors may have limited (or excess) time and ‘visual space’ because of the device they’re using or their environment. As the website is more limited in these ways, what it displays has to be reduced, pushing away the less-important information, and keeping only the important information.;
, Although you could try to make your website respond to all devices in all conditions, this is probably a waste of time and money. Rather, spend time finding out:


How your visitors use your website, including how much time they spend on it, how they read and view the content, how far away they are from the screen, and so on
What sorts of devices they use most often to view the website, and which devices they may use in the near future
Where (at home, outside, in a car, at work, etc.) and when they currently and would view your website

, Usually, you’ll want to provide the most information or website content for the size/resolution of the device that the visitor is using; keep in mind the viewing distance on large devices like TVs however. Grid-based layouts simplify this task by providing different numbers of columns for blocks of content depending on the device. For example, a website may use 5 columns for its layout on large devices, 3 columns on tablets, and 1 column on a regular phone.

, A combination of CSS and JavaScript can be used to detect the device that the website is being used on, and it’s specifications (such as if it supports the Flash or the latest version of HTML), and adjust the website accordingly. CSS Media Queries are particularly useful for determining the size / resolution of the device.


For instance, you can use the following media query to set CSS styles for the website when it’s viewed by screens that have more than 1000 pixels horizontally.
@media only screen and (min-width: 1000px) {  }



, Responsive websites typically try to display smaller images and videos for mobile devices like phones because phone screens are typically smaller than computer or TV screens, and because phone are often used with limited-bandwidth data contracts. This has become less of a problem, however, as smartphones have increasingly higher-resolution screens. In addition, modern browsers often use pre-fetching that makes it difficult to send a particular-sized image to the device.


On the opposite side, as all devices have increasingly higher resolution screens, it has become necessary to display higher-resolution images within websites. Basically, you should be aware of the best sizes for the media on your website, and look out for technology that allows you to choose the right media for the visitor.

, The visitor could be interacting with the website using a mouse, a keyboard, a touchscreen, or even a screen-reader (for visually-impaired people). Considering this, your website needs to be able to respond to mouse clicks, the ‘tab’, ‘enter’ and other keys, and screen finger-touches.


Hover-over effects do not work with anything except for a mouse. Instead you could use requite the visitor to click a button or icon to display whatever was previously displayed on a mouse hover.
Items need to show that they are focused when a user presses the ‘tab’ key.

However, most are designed for easy removal. Many require no tools whatsoever, and those that do usually require only a Phillips or flat-head screwdriver.


Refer to the operating instructions included with the system at the time of purchase if the method for removing the tower door cannot be easily determined.

, The method for removing the case panel on a laptop computer varies only slightly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Most will require removing a series of Phillips-head screws from an easily identifiable panel located on the bottom of the device.

, The tools needed to clean the case interior are a can of compressed air, cotton swabs and a pair of tweezers. Take care to avoid contact with components, cables and wires as much as possible during the cleaning process. Always maintain a distance of 4 inches (10 cm) between a can of compressed air and any computer components inside the computer case.


Remove any large particles or dust balls using a pair of tweezers. Avoid direct contact with components, cables and wires as much as possible.
Use a can of compressed air to blow out small particles from around each component inside the case. Be sure to maintain the recommended distance of 4 inches (10 cm) between the nozzle of the can and any part of the computer.
Blow out any dust or debris that collected around each fan installed, including the case fans, the power supply fan and the CPU fan. The CPU fan will typically be mounted on a heat-sink that sits on top of the CPU, often located on or near the middle of the computer's motherboard. Refer to the operating instructions that came with your computer for a detailed diagram of the location of the CPU fan.

Turn on your computer and see the magic.",How to Make a Strobe CPU Fan," The flasher circuit is really easy to make. The circuit takes 12v, converts it down to 3v using the 1k resistor and flashes it using the transistor and capacitor.;
, Firstly, warm up your soldering iron. Place your 1k resistor onto your breadboard (brown ring at input and gold at output) and solder it in place.

, Before adding the transistor, cut off the middle leg since we won't need this. Place your transistor onto the board with the rounded end pointing upward (to your resistor) and then place the left leg of the transistor onto the output of the resistor. The right leg will be your positive output for your led.

, Place your capacitor onto your breadboard. The side with the white strip will go onto your negative input and the other side onto the transistor and resistor input legs.

, Place your last resistor (100ohm) onto your breadboard (Gold on the white side of the capacitor and brown on an empty track). The output of this resistor will be your negative output for the led.

, Repeat the building process to make a second one. Now use the schematic as a reference of where to put your input and output wires.

, Depending on your skills, your controllers can be small enough to fit into a match box. Use electrical tape to cover up your box and keep everything inside. This will also protect the circuit in a way.

, If you use flat LEDs like in the picture, solder wires onto the contacts of the LEDs to make it easier to connect them. If you didn't use these kind of LEDs, skip ahead.

, First, determine the direction in which your fan rotates. This is normally clock wise. You will place your LEDs so that they shine in the direction the fan rotates. This will give them a bit of a tail.

, Using your glue gun or super glue, glue the LEDs onto the top bars of the fan, close to middle. Glue the wires so they lead to the center of the fan. You will connect them here later.

, Use an old USB cable to connect your LEDs since they have four wires inside. Use no more than 2 LEDs per flasher and do not connect them in series. They will not flash in series. For best results, connect your LEDs in a cross manner. Close up the wires with shrink wrap or electrical tape. Tape the usb cable onto your CPU fan's input wires to keep them in place.

, Reinsert your fan back into your computer and wire it up. Make sure the fan is tightened tightly so that it works efficiently.

, Connect the input wires of the two flashers to a 12v output on your computer's power supply. Connect the output wires to the usb cable leading to the fan's LEDs. Close all the connections up with electrical tape or shrink wrap.

, If your circuit was done correctly, you should see something like in the image above. Well, there you go: something cool to show off to your friends!

Avoid installing unknown software applications.,
Install an anti-malware application.,
Buy a sturdy laptop bag.,
Place the laptop on a safe place.,
Use keyboard covers.,
Shut it down when not in use.",How to Keep a Gaming Laptop Healthy," Gaming laptops tend to run at full capacity during gameplay. This means that vital parts such as the processor and graphics card generate more heat. Play your games on your laptop in an open area or inside a room with an air-conditioning system that stabilizes the room temperature. Avoid using the laptop inside a very hot room or environment as this will surely overheat your device.;
, If you can’t avoid using your gaming laptop during increased temperature conditions, you may opt to buy third-party cooling accessories. Accessories like laptop cooling pads or platforms where you can place your laptop on while playing a game can ensure that your gaming laptop will get good airflow. You can buy aftermarket cooling accessories from any computer retailer store for as low as $15.

, Gaming laptops require a high amount of energy to operate. That’s why these types of portable computers tend to have a shorter battery capacity compared to their office-use counterparts. When your laptop’s battery starts alerting you that it’s already low, quickly plug it into an outlet and charge it. Constantly draining the laptop battery decreases its capacity and shortens its lifespan.

, Using the laptop while charging also decreases the lifespan of the battery because it doesn’t get its battery cells properly charged. Plug in the batteries when you’re planning on gaming on the go.

, Ambiguous applications tend to hide malware, which can infect your computer system once it’s installed. Check the Internet and do a little research first about the software you’re about to use before installing it on your laptop.

, Anti-malware applications, like antiviruses and firewalls, can protect your gaming laptop from any possible infections. It can prevent serious threats from causing damage digitally to your gaming laptop that can jeopardize important files and media saved on your computer.

, Carrying your laptop around puts it in a vulnerable position. Accidental bumps to the device can seriously damage its screen or body. Purchase a durable and well-cushioned laptop bag or carrying case to protect your gaming laptop from any physical damage.


Laptop bags come in different designs and sizes. A decent laptop bag can cost around $40 to $50. Not cheap, but gaming laptops costs a fortune, so it’s still a very smart investment to protect your prized possession.

, Be very mindful of where you’re leaving your gaming laptop. Avoid placing it where liquids can spill or objects can fall on it. Put your device on a sturdy and clean table, away from any obstructions.

, Gaming laptop keyboards take the same abuse as their desktop counterparts, only they’re not easily replaceable once they break. Use keyboard covers to prevent dusts dropping and squeezing between the tiny gaps found on your keyboard. Keyboard covers can also help prevent key labels from rubbing off and getting erased. Keyboard covers can be bought from local computer retailers for around $5.

, Finally, just like any other device, your gaming laptop needs some rest too. After a long day of intense gaming, turn your device off to save power. Wait for a few minutes for your laptop to cool off before placing it inside the bag to avoid moisture building up inside.

Unlock the phone by placing your thumb on the home button and letting the TouchID software scan your fingerprint.
Enter the 4-digit passcode that you set on your iPhone when you set it up.;
,


If you cannot find it and your iPhone is equipped with Siri, long-press on the home button to activate Siri. Ask her to “Open Settings.”

, You cannot connect to a wireless network if Airplane Mode is turned on.


Airplane Mode is the first setting on the list when you open Settings.
You will know that it is turned on because the slider on its bar will be to the right, and the space behind the slider will be green. Tap it to turn it off.

, Once you are sure that Airplane Mode is turned off, you will see that Wi-Fi is second on the list, just below Airplane Mode. This is the setting that controls your wireless network connection.

, If your Wi-Fi setting is not turned on, tap the slider to the right. It should slide to the right and the background of the slider should turn green.

, Your iPhone should generate a list of nearby wireless networks to which your phone can connect.Search for your network on the list.


Alternatively, you might be in a public place and trying to connect to a restaurant's or company's public Wi-Fi. Search for the name of that Wi-Fi network.
Take note of which Wi-Fi networks are secure. This means that they are password protected. A network is secure if it has a lock symbol next to its name.

, If your wireless network is not on the list, then tap the option that says “Other....”


Under this setting, type in the name of your wireless network. Then, select which type of security it has protecting it. This requires knowing the security code provided by your wireless router or asking the network administrator to tell you the type of security the network has.
This is also necessary for hidden networks. If you know you are trying to connect to a hidden network, you will have to take this step., Once you tap the Wi-Fi network to which you want to connect, the next screen will prompt you for a password. Type in the password correctly.


If you do not know the password to the wireless network, you will have to ask the person who owns it. Or, if it is your own wireless network and you forgot the password, you will have to check the wireless router to see if it is marked on it or contact the person or company who set up the wireless router.

, If you entered the password correctly, your iPhone should connect immediately to the network.


If you cannot tap “Join,” or if nothing happens when you tap it, then the password is either incorrect or too short., When your screen redirects back to the Wi-Fi page, and your iPhone finishes connecting to the Wi-Fi network, you should see a blue checkmark appear to the left of the network name.Additionally, you can open Safari (or your browser app of choice) and navigate to a website. If it works, your iPhone has successfully connected to the Wi-Fi network. If it does not, you will have to try to reconnect.

, Many restaurants and companies require you to open your Internet browser on your phone to complete the connection process.


When you open the app, it will redirect to a screen where you will click “Connect” or enter the company's password to connect. You may also have to select a button that you agree to the company's Terms and Conditions.After that, you should be connected to the company's Wi-Fi. Try navigating to another website to ensure that the connection is solid.

, When you leave the range of a known Wi-Fi network, your iPhone is no longer connected to it. If you would like to use a wireless network somewhere else, you can turn on the Ask to Join Networks setting.


Tap the slider to the right of “Ask to Join Networks” at the bottom of the Wi-Fi settings page. It should slide to the right and the background will turn green.
When you are in an area with no known networks, your iPhone will prompt you to connect to one when you try to use your Internet browser. This requires connecting to a free network or knowing the password to connect to a secured one.Follow Steps 6-10 above to connect to a new network.

Check the colors.,
Open L-Edit.

,
Create a layout for an inverter as shown in the figure accompanying this step.

,From File > Open > mosis_stud > morbn20.tbn

,
Create contact and via.,
Make an inverter.,
Put Vdd and ground to your layout.,
Do a design rule check.,
If no errors found you can now proceed to extraction.

",How to Lay Out an Inverter Using L Edit," Before opening L-edit, make sure to run it in 256 colors. This is done by right-clicking ledit.exe -> Properties, and then ledit Properties window will appear.


From the window, go to Compatibility tab and under the Settings check “Run in 256 colors” then click ok.;
,,,, Create new cell from the Cell tab then click New or just press N. To create a layout for an inverter, contact and via is needed.


Contact: Metal > Active (either N-type/P-Type)

Press N, change “New cell name:” into metal1toActive then click ok.
From the Layer Selection choose metal1 and from toolbar select Box Tool, then draw a 5” x5” square box.
Again, from Layer Selection, select Active Contact and create a 2”x2” box then place it at the center of Metal1.
Use an Active layer to overlap in a 5”x5” Metal1.
Save your work.


Contact: Metal > Poly(Gate)

Press N, change “New cell name:” into metal1toPoly then click ok.
From the Layer Selection choose metal1 and from toolbar select Box Tool, then draw a 5” x5” square box.
Again, from Layer Selection, select Poly Contact and create a 2”x2” box then place it at the center of Metal1.
Use a Poly layer to overlap in a 5”x5” Metal1.
Save your work.


Via: Metal > Metal

Name new cell as via12. (this refers to metal1 > metal2)
Draw a 5”x5” metal1 box.
Create a 2”x2” via box then place it at the center of metal1.
Draw a 5”x5” metal2 and overlap it to the metal1.
Save your cell.



, Since the contacts and via needed for the layout have been created, now proceed to making an inverter. As you go along, you will encounter different design rules. Remember that the transistor width is equal to the height of the active layer and transistor length is the width of the poly-layer. From the given schematic, the PMOS length and width is equal to 2u and 5u respectively. And NMOS length and width is equal to 2u and 5u respectively. Now, press N and name the cell as the inverter.


Create a 14”x5” Active layer.
Cell click instance or just press “i”. From the cells you created, select the cell you need to use.This time select metal1toActive.
Place the metal1toActive contact as shown in the Figure 1.6.

Rules for poly

Overlap active layer by at least 2u at the top and bottom.
At least 1u distance from metal1 to active contact.




Since an additional 2u at the top and bottom is needed to create a poly and a distance of 1u from the metal1 to active contact is required, a 2”x9” poly is needed. Place it at the center of our active layer.
Copy the transistor then paste. You can also use Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. From here, you will be creating PMOS and NMOS by overlapping the active layer with at least 2u on all sides, using PSelect and NSelect respectively. The Figure accompanying this sub-section shows what it looks like after putting the Nselect and Pselect layers.

, Just copy the top transistor and place it at the bottom of the NMOS. Then copy the bottom transistor and put it at the top of the PMOS. Remove the poly layer to the copied transistors.


Overlap the Vdd and PMOS with N-well as shown in the figure accompanying this sub-step.
Lastly, connect the Vdd, gnd, Vin and Vout of the inverter as shown in the Figure below.

Note that the drain and the source of the transistor are interchangeable. It is the designer’s choice which will be the drain and source to produce an optimized layout.


From the toolbar, select Port Tool and click on the layout where Vdd, gnd, Vin and Vout belongs as shown in the figure accompanying this step.

In order to have a proper connection of the ports, see to it that it is placed at the metal1 layer. To check, highlight port name, edit, edit object or just press Ctrl+e. (Figure 1.10).



, To make sure that no rules are violated, use the DRC (Design Rule Check). Tools > DRC.

Propose.,
Wait for the ceremony.",How to Get Married on Harvest Moon DS," If you want to marry a bachelorette, the first and most obvious thing to do is to pick a bachelorette to court. There are 14 bachelorettes to choose from, 5 girls who are common and easy to court, 4 girls who are special and harder to court, and 5 girls from Mineral Town who do not have a visible Heart Color and can only be seen by equipping a Love Bangle or by talking to her. Once you've chosen your bachelorette, you are now ready for the next step!
, You must complete all of the bachelorette's Heart Events if you ever want to marry her. To do that, you must:

Get her to a certain Heart Color.
Wait for the right time and weather.
Walk from a certain place to the place where the event will occur.
Must have seen a certain Heart Event.

, Even after you've finished all the Heart Events, you still have to get the bachelorette to the highest Heart Color there is! To do so, you must:

Give the girl her favorite present everyday.
Talk to her everyday.
Give her the right answers to her questions in every Heart Event.

, This step can be done any time! As long as you have the money for it. To marry your bachelorette, you must have room for her and your future child. This might take a while because you have to upgrade it twice., This step can also be done at any time! As long as you have the money for it. Another essential thing for marrying your bachelorette is owning a Big Bed! To do so, you must have gotten the TV Shopping Channel in the Sprite Station. The Big Bed is the first thing on sale when you have upgraded your house twice, even if you don't have a kitchen!, This is probably the hardest and most irritating step. You must find 60 of the 101 Sprites scattered across the valley. But if you are aiming to marry the Harvest Goddess, you're going to have to find all of the Sprites hidden in the valley., Getting the Blue Feather is the last thing you'll ever need to do if you want to get married. The Blue Feather will be available as soon as you propose except if it's a Tuesday or if it's already after 5 PM., This is the last and the easiest part of getting married. Just find the girl and equip the Blue Feather then use it on her., After this, she will accept, and you will need to wait for one whole week for the marriage ceremony. After the ceremony, the credits will roll and the game will end. Also, if you ever try to reload the game, you will go back to your last save point where you're unmarried."

Read and contribute to wikis.",How to Have Computer Fun4," Google Earth gives you an up-close look at almost any place you want to see. Using Street View, you can actually explore the streets of Tokyo, or try to find Al Pacino's house. Look up your own house and see if anyone left a window open.


If you want to test your geography skills, check out GeoGuessr, which presents you with a random Google Earth street picture and makes you guess where in the world it is. The closer your guess, the more points you get., Want to see a list of the 25 Best Sandwiches in the World in .gifs? How about the top 20 toys kids loved in the 90s? Buzzfeed, Upworthy, Slate, The Awl, and other sites all have hilarious and interesting lists of random things you didn't know you cared about. Check them out for a great way to kill a little time and not think too hard.

, For news that matters to you, find your local news source online and read up on the stories that matter most to you. Increasingly, people engage with their local news sources less and less, which means the average Internet user knows more about what's going on in the lives of celebrities than in their own local government. Use the Internet to learn about where you live.

, Develop skills and better yourself while you're having fun. Massively open online courses, or MOOCs, are free and easy to find. It's like sitting in the hallowed halls of Harvard but in the comfort of your own home. Look for MOOCs by searching a database like this one.

, Whatever you're interested in, there's probably a whole online community of others who love it, too. Like gaming? Check out PC Gamer or IGN to learn about the latest games. Music fan? Check out Pitchfork, Aquarium Drunkard, or Brooklyn Vegan. Do some poking around and find a community with like-minded interests that you can engage with, or at least explore.

, If you're curious about what the internet looked like 10 or 15 years back, there's a handy way to travel back through time. The Internet Archive has built a tool that lets you access old versions of websites.

, If you're already here, you might as well join up and start contributing! Wikis like wikiHow and Wikipedia can only survive with user-generated content and users who are willing to perform all kinds of essential tasks that keep the site up and running. From patrolling recent changes to starting whole new articles, contributing to a wiki can be a rewarding and fun activity.

Look at UberFactsand see who can come up with the most random fact to talk about. Share links, pictures, and videos that will make your friends laugh.


Facebook, Skype, Kik Messenger, and Google Mail are probably the most common chatting services, but Yahoo, AOL, other email service chat generators are also available for old-fashioned IMs.
If you're feeling lonely, try video chatting with your friends. It can help to make it feel like you're actually hanging out. Just don't video chat with people you don't know well. Message and old friend and get together on Facebook video chat or Skype.

, Facebook is a great way to kill some time. You can upload content, check out other people's updates, and talk to your friends instantly. It's a great way to get in touch and have fun on the computer.


If you're bored with your Feed, do some deep digging into someone you don't know. Your best friend's second cousin's girlfriend's Facebook page probably has a bunch of stuff on it that you've never seen. Check out vacation pictures from ten years ago.
Or you could add some content. Studies show that people who spend more time looking at other people's content and less time adding their own are more depressed and bored than people who do.Update your status, add some pictures, and write on other peoples' walls.

, Make a Twitter account and start following celebrities, your friends, and other interesting Tweeters to get engaging in the hashtag community, if you haven't already. If you can be witty, concise, and engaging, you can build up some followers and entertain them with ridiculous Tweets on a daily basis. Then start a Twitter beef with Steve Inskeep from NPR or Nicki Minaj. Kidding. Don't do that.

, Have you ever been to a restaurant and had an opinion about it? Of course you have. Might as well put it online right? In all seriousness, offering consumer criticism is a great way of killing some time online and having fun. Let your voice be heard.

, Pinterest is a great way of exploring recipes, fun facts, clothes, and other lifestyle hacks, as well of sharing your great finds with others.

Change your screensaver.,
Turn the screen upside down.,
Listen to music.,
Take some pictures.,
Photoshop some pictures.,
Keep a digital diary.,
Record a song.",How to Have Computer Fun6," Feeling bored? Give your computer a makeover. Computer savvy people call it a desktop theme. You can begin by clicking on My Computer and then Control Panel on a PC, or selecting System Preferences on a Mac. In making over your computer alone, there are loads of things to do:


The appearance and colors of your computer
The sounds on your computer
Your mouse icon
Your display settings

, Surf Google Images or proper wallpaper sites, and get an awesome-looking wallpaper for your computer. Sharks wearing birthday hats? Sweet. Be creative - get a pretty shot of your favorite celebrity, a cool pattern, or a nice picture of your favorite magazine or brand.

, Scroll through your pictures and pick a new screensaver, or download one. You could always go with a slideshow of all your pictures (meh) or one that makes it look like the Matrix (sweet).

, On a PC and Mac hit the combination CTRL-ALT-DOWN.

, Have fun on the computer by listening to music and digging around your playlists. Make a fresh playlist or mix of songs that would be fun to dance to, to meditate to, or do work out to, and spend way too much time organizing it. Turn your iTunes on random to shuffle all your songs into a strange order and try to guess what's being played. Turn on the iTunes or Windows Media Player visualizer function to give yourself something to stare at while you zone out. Or, you know, just listen to the good stuff.

, If you've got a webcam installed, mess around taking selfies, setting up weird still-life pictures in front of your computer, or just goofing with the picture filters on your computer. Make yourself look like a bent-up alien with a weird nose, or mess with the colors until you look seasick.

, If you've got Photoshop installed, cut up pictures and make weird meme-worthy new ones. Your grandmother's face on Stallone's body? Good start.

, Back in the dark ages (like the 1970s), people used to actually keep things called diaries, in which they wrote about their life, eloquently and with detailed writing. Shocker, right? It's actually a great way of spending a couple hours on your computer, especially if you can't get online. Open up a word-processing file and just start writing about your day. Keep a running log. Who knows, you might like it so much that you could transition it into making a blog somewhere down the road.

, Most newer models of computers have built-in internal microphones and software installed that will allow you to record a song (or sounds at least) onto your computer and start manipulating it in minutes. You don't have to be super-talented, or even have an instrument on hand to record music. Just record yourself humming, then turn up the distortion on the settings and listen to the wild sounds you can make. Layer yourself reading random passages from the Bible, then another track of your dog snoring. Avant-garde masterpiece.


Record a podcast of yourself like an old school DJ, talking about your favorite songs in between each track in the playlist. Pick songs with a theme and make a playlist, then record a vocal track of chatting in between. Do it with a friend for extra fun.
Edit other songs together, changing the settings on a Bob Dylan track to make it sound like death metal, or messing around with death metal to make it sound like ambient drone music. Slowing down tracks by 700% even became a meme recently, from dial-up sounds to Nickelback songs."

Learn to write code.,
Learn web design.,
Explore new operating systems.,
Customize your computer.",How to Have Computer Fun7," If you're tired of the ""typical"" ways of having fun on your computer, why not take your passion to the next level? Learning how to code allows you design and write your own computer programs from the ground up. It's a little like learning a new language and can be a bit of a challenge, but it can be seriously rewarding (plus, it looks great on your resume.)There are a lot of different programming languages out there. Though there's no ""right"" way to learn to program, here are five languages frequently recommended for beginners:Python
C/C++
Java
Javascript
Ruby


Check out CodeAcademy.com for free interactive coding tutorials in a number of programming languages.

, Do you find yourself spending tons of time online? If so, consider learning the basics of web design so that you can create your own sites and give back to the online community! Some basic web design skills overlap with the list of basic programming languages above (for instance, many sites use Javascript.) On the other hand, skills like HTML coding offer the chance to learn web-centric programming.


Here's just a short list of sites that offer web design training courses for free:

GeekChamp.comWebPlatform.org
Berkeley.eduLearn.ShayHowe.com, Did you know that you don't necessarily have to use the operating system your computer came with? It's true — Mac computers can run Windows OSs, PCs can run Mac OSs, and both can run free user-created OSs! Getting this set up can be a little tricky, so consult the support page of the program you use (or browse our help articles) if you run into problems.


To run Windows on a Mac, use:

Boot Camp (comes pre-installed or available for free download)
A Parallels program, like Parallels Desktop 10 for Mac


To run a Mac OS on a PC, use:

A bootable USB driveA virtualization program like VirtualboxAlso consider alternatives like Linux, Ubuntu, and Haiku - free OSs that work on both Mac and Windows!

, If you can't get the performance you want out of your computer the way it is, consider opening it up and changing your physical hardware. Depending on what you intend to do, this can actually be surprisingly easy. However, since it's easy to damage the fragile components inside a computer, it's important only to try this if you know what you're doing.


Here are some components that can be modified or replaced to increase a computer's performance:

Graphics card
Sound card (This will not increase performance although it can increase sound quality)
Fan/cooling system
RAM
Processor/CPU
Also cleaning out all the dust in a computer can speed it up, but be careful to be grounded as for static electricity can ruin a computer!


If you're feeling especially ambitious, try making computer maintenance a hobby. Some people like to take apart and rebuild their computers for fun — just like people who enjoy tooling around on cars. Best of all, this practical know-how will give you a natural knowledge of the inside of a computer that most people can only dream of.

Prepare to be noticed.,
If someone asks you about what you're wearing, be gracious.,
If you notice someone whispering to a friend about you, just smile.,
Ask for permission before taking photos or video.,
Use Google Glass to help yourself and others.,
Respect and acknowledge others while wearing Glass.,
Limit the times when you have the Glass' screen on.,
Know when to leave it at home.",How to Have Google Glass Etiquette," There are only about 7,000 devices in the US and about 10,000 total in the rest of the world.You will get plenty of attention while wearing Google Glass because it's a novelty and a curiosity at this point in time. The novelty factor and desire to learn more about it makes it even more of a reason to be courteous to those curious about your new technology.;
, If you have time, explain to them what Google Glass is. No need to let them touch it, if you are not comfortable.


Cultivate a response for those who ask what Google Glass is. This will help make the interactions seamless and enjoyable.

, They are more curious than anything. Slightly acknowledging their presence will give everyone peace of mind.

, As with all smart devices, it's always common courtesy to ask before recording images or taking photos. When in public, always ask before you take photos or video. Treat it just like a phone camera.

, For example, if a friend wants to know the score of the football game, ask Glass and save them the time of looking it up.

, Your Glass should be treated more as an assistant instead of a new friend. Do not neglect your social circles for sake of your new technology.

, Having the screen on might cause people to think you are recording them. It also drains the battery faster.

, As cool and nice as Google Glass is, there are times it's just not appropriate to wear for safety or legal reasons. The following lists just some of the times to leave Glass at home:


Movie theaters (cinemas). Recording devices are illegal in movie theaters worldwide. Glass is considered a recording device, as it's not concealed and has a camera.
Casinos. Most casinos actually have a ""No Glass Policy"" when around the gambling tables. They claim it's to prevent cheating and fraud during gambling. It may be okay to wear Glass to casinos, but just keep your distance from the tables.
The ""bad parts"" of town. The majority of people you meet, whether wealthy or poor, will know what Glass is. Google does have insurance on Glass but it doesn't cover theft or loss, so if someone were to take them off your face and run away, you'd be out of luck.
Driving. Glass is an electronic device and is considered to be ""distractive"". For this reason, many states such as California, Nevada, and Washington are giving tickets to those who drive and wear Google Glass, whether it's switched on or not.

Some laws are in the process of being passed to remove the driving ban, since with some cars like the Tesla Model S, Glass will assist you with a speedometer, battery life, tire pressure, etc. You'll need to keep yourself updated on progress.


Bars. Most people have heard of the Molotov incident in San Francisco.So bars are probably not the place for Glass.
Social events when you risk appearing rude. You should not take Glass to large family gatherings or dinners out in public. It can be seen as rude.

 ;
, To ensure that using a computer for an extended period of time won't injure you in any way, dim the brightness on your monitor to reduce eye strain. Also learn proper posture when using a computer and how to type correctly. Remember to keep your feet on the floor, back straight, and hands on the keys A,S,D,F and the other keys J,K,L. Learn how to sit at a computer to prevent back, wrist, and eye damage.

, Turn on some of your favorite music to help you get through the day; just make sure it doesn't distract you from any work you must get done! Prepare some quick snacks so that you can stay energized through the day, and drink lots of caffeinated drinks such as coffee.





, The worst thing when trying to work is distractions. To remove all distractions shutdown any email or IM programs. Don't open anything that isn't related to your work (but if you do only open it once or twice).

Your Sniper.,
Attachments.,
Perks.,
Miscellaneous.",How to Be a Good Sniper on Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare1," The MORS is the weapon of choice for most snipers, being the only bolt action sniper in the game, however the Lynx and Atlas 40mm are both viable options as well, even with these semi-automatics, one shot kills are not hard to find.;
, This one is up to preference, if you plan on using your sights a lot, or ""hardscoping"", then Ballistics CPU would probably be a safe bet. However if you plan to quickscope, then the sight of your choice would be best, or if you don't need a sight, then again Ballistics CPU would be good.

, The first perk is up to you, Flak Jacket is a good option if you are playing objective-based games, but can be substituted for other perks if wanted. For the second and third perks, Fast Hands and Toughness are a must, and should only practically be substituted if you can make up for it elsewhere.

, The lethals, exo abilities, score streaks, and secondaries don't immediately affect your sniping, so this comes right down to whatever you like to have, some snipers like to have a secondary to finish of hitmarkers while others like spike drones to go for trickshots.

"
"
Use your triggers wisely.,
Have situational awareness.,
Find your play style.",How to Be a Good Sniper on Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare2," The controller's triggers only go so far and only need a little jolt to shoot. This is why it is often useful only push them down a little bit to increase your reaction time. Many modded controllers have stops on them to improve this, so upgrading your controller may be a viable option.

, When sniping it only ever useful to camp when you know you're secure. if this not the case, on a map, move around a lot and only aim down the sight for no more than 15-20 seconds to try to hard scope.

, Some people can run and gun very well with the sniper, while others are better suited laying prone in the back of the map. Play a few games playing both to figure out what style suits you best.

Strip the two insulated wires and twist the shielding into a third ""wire."",
Slip the case over the wire.

,
Tin the wire with solder (heat it up and coat it).,
Slightly scratch the connectors on the back of the plug so that the solder will go on easier This way, they are super clean, and the solder will flow on nicely.,
Join the common, then join the left and right.,
Put some tape around each connection to insulate them.,
Screw it all together.,
Test the finished product to ensure that each of the three sections on the front of the plug have not somehow become connected to another section by a short circuit.",How to Solder Stereo Mini Plugs," The two insulated wires are for left and right. The third, twisted one (made from the shield) is for common. Note, you will need some insulation on the left and right wires. If you strip them for their full length, they are likely to touch each other and the common wire, causing a short circuit. 2 or 3 mm of stripped wire will be plenty.;
,, If you aren't familiar with soldering procedures, look for an online guide.

, Also tin these, but only where you plan to connect the cable.

, Note which conductor on the jack is connected to the tip and ensure the left channel wire is attached to this one. If the wires are color coded red and white, the left would be the white wire.

, Only use a tiny bit, or the cover won't go on.

, You did slip the case over the wire first, didn't you?

, All three sections should not be connected to any other section - even if you wobble the back of the plug around (as will happen during use). Check that the wires are connected properly. A multimeter with a buzzer is ideal for this, or you can use a homemade one with a light.

The most important part of doing this right is to make sure that all your electronics are properly connected.,
Connect the DVD player to the amplifier.,
Connect the CD recorder to the amplifier.,
Connect your speakers to the amplifier in the manner proscribed in your amplifier’s instructions.

,
Plug in all three devices and turn them on.

,
Set the amp to play music from the DVD player.,
Set up the DVD to play the song you would like to record, and pause it just before the song begins.

,
Insert a blank disk into the CD recorder.

,
Press ‘record’ on your CD recorder (this may also be labeled ‘manual record’ or ‘line-in record.,
Immediately after pressing record, start playing the DVD.,
When the song ends, or when you would like to end the track, press Stop on the CD recorder and DVD player.,
Repeat steps 6 through 10 to record additional tracks.,
When the disk is recorded the way you want it, finalize the CD.,
And that’s it.",How to Record Music from a DVD Video to a CD," Double-check all your connections with these instructions to make sure you have everything connected before you begin recording. Do not plug in any power cords until all the other connections are made; this will reduce the chance for electrical shock.;
, To do this, connect one end of an L-R cable to the OUTPUT jacks of the DVD player, and connect the other end of the L-R cable to a set of INPUT jacks on the amplifier. (Note: you can plug the cable into any set of input jacks on the amplifier, so long as when you begin recording, you set the amplifier to play music from that input)

, To do this, connect one end of an L-R cable to the INPUT jacks of the CD Recorder, and connect the other end of the L-R cable to a set of OUTPUT jacks on the amplifier. ( Note: There is usually a specific set of output jacks for this step. They may be labeled ‘tape’, ‘recorder’, ‘burner’, or something similar.)

,,, Test this by playing the DVD over your speakers. If the music is distorted or only coming in on one side of your speaker set, go back and check your connections.

,,, Use the function that lets you manually control recording from a line-in)

, The recorder will read whatever is being played on the amplifier and record it to the CD.

, Pay attention to the recording, because the CD recorder will record whatever is being played, regardless of when the DVD starts or stops.

, You can do this as many times as you like until the disk fills up.

, This step makes the disk readable in normal CD players.

, You can repeat these steps as many times as you like to record all your DVDs onto CDs. You can then record these CDs onto your computer, effectively archiving all your DVDs as mp3 files.

Try to locate the reset button on the face of the unit.,
If the above method doesn't work, you'll need a Q-tip with a sturdy handle.,
Gently push the swab into the CD-loading slot, and as you press the eject button, move the swab from side to side completely.",How to Remove a Stuck CD from a Kenwood KDC 138 CD Changer," It will likely look like a small hole. When you find it, use a straightened paperclip or toothpick to insert into the reset hole and press. This will reset all your radio settings and your clock to 12:00, but it should cause the unit to eject your CD(s) when you press the eject button.;
, If you can get one like the doctor uses with a long wooden handle that would be good, otherwise get a small package of REAL Q-tip branded swabs. What you're looking for in a swab is a handle that won't bend too much.

, This will cause the eject-sensor pins to line up and thus release the CD for the unit to eject. You may need to remove the unit's face (hopefully yours has a detachable face) and grasp the CD and manually finish pulling it out of the load-slot. Re-attach the face and spray some canned compressed air (like for computers) into the unit followed by a good CD laser lens cleaning disc. What most likely has happened is there is dirt dust and grit accumulated in the tracks where those pins travel. If you fail to get the unit to load the CD laser lens cleaning disc you may either need to get the Q-tip and swab from the right side back to center then the left side back to center which will re-set the unit to accept the new disc, or try putting the disc in the loading slot partway until you feel the unit ""grab"" and pull the CD. Let it take it in some but keep your grip in the disc, and gently pull like you're trying to pull it back out. After 2 to 4 seconds, turn the disc loose and see if the player loads it. If all goes well, a little squirt of WD-40 will help keep the pins traveling in their tracks freely, but you'll have to use the cleaning disc again after you do that.

Turn on your system about 200% volume.,
You can purchase brown bread and line the subwoofer enclosure.,
Remove your rear plate and cover the back with some as well.,
Tightening any screws for your rear bumper, rear trunk lid, interior panels, plates, tail lights, etc will remove a lot of vibration, especially on older cars.,
Moving from outside to inside, make sure your backseat doesn't have cups, metal containers, or any other loose materials.,
If you have loose change, consider getting a coin holder with slots for quarters, dimes, nickels.",How to Reduce Rattles from Your Subwoofers," Working mid-day or in a parking lot greatly reduces people getting angry at you for loud music.;
, This can be very expensive. At home depot, there is a cheap insulator called peel and seal. This stuff works wonders for those on a budget.

, This will stop the plate from rattling up against your bumper.

, In about 20 minutes of tightening screws I cut down the vibrations on a friends corolla by about 30%.

, All things vibrate when in the presence of subwoofers. More things vibrating = more noise = less sound quality and bass.

, This way the loose change doesn't rattle the whole time.

Check the label for a nominal impedance rating.,
Set a multimeter to measure resistance.,
Remove the speaker from its cabinet or open the back of the cabinet.,
Cut off the power to the speaker.,
Connect the multimeter leads to the speaker terminals.,
Estimate the impedance from the resistance.",How to Measure Speaker Impedance1," Most speaker manufacturers list an impedance rating on the speaker label or the packaging. This ""nominal"" impedance rating (usually 4, 8, or 16 ohms) is an estimate of the minimum impedance for typical audio ranges. This usually occurs at a frequency between 250 and 400 Hz. The actual impedance is fairly close to this value within this range, and rises slowly as you increase the frequency. Below this range, the impedance changes rapidly, peaking at the resonant frequency of the speaker and its enclosure.Some speaker labels display an actual, measured impedance for a specific listed impedance.
To give you an idea of what these frequencies mean, most bass tracks fall between 90 and 200 Hz, while ""chest thumping"" sub bass can be as low as 20 Hz. The midrange, including the majority of non-percussion instruments and voices, covers 250 Hz to 2kHz.;
, A multimeter sends out a small DC current to measure resistance. Since impedance is a quality of AC circuits, this will not measure impedance directly. However, this approach will get you close enough for most home audio setups. (For example, you can easily distinguish between a 4 ohm and 8 ohm speaker this way.) Use the lowest range resistance setting. This is 200Ω for many multimeters, but a multimeter with a lower setting (20Ω) may give more accurate results.


If there is only one setting for resistance, your multimeter is auto-ranging, and will find the correct range automatically.
Too much DC current can damage or destroy the voice coil of a speaker.The risk is low here, since most multimeters only produce a small current., If you're dealing with a loose speaker with no connections or speaker box, then there is nothing you need to do here.

, Any power running to the speaker will ruin your measurement, and could fry your multimeter. Turn off the power. If the wires connected to the terminal are not soldered on, detach them.


Do not remove any wires connected directly to the speaker cone.

, Look closely at the terminals and determine which is positive and which is negative. There is often a ""+"" and a ""-"" sign to identify them. Connect the multimeter's red probe to the positive side, and the black probe to the negative side.

, Typically, the resistance reading should be roughly 15% less than the nominal impedance on the label.For example, it's normal for an 8-ohm speaker to have a resistance between 6 or 7 ohms.


The majority of loudspeakers have a nominal impedance of 4, 8, or 16 ohms. Unless you get a strange result, it's safe to assume your speaker has one of these impedance values for the purpose of pairing it with an amplifier.

Get a tool that generates a sine wave.,
Connect the tool to an amplifier input.,
Set the amp to a low voltage.,
Choose a high value resistor.,
Measure the exact resistance of the resistor.,
Connect the resistor and speaker in series.,
Keep the speaker away from obstructions.,
Calculate the current.,
Adjust the frequency to find the resonance peak.,
Calculate the impedance at resonance.,
Calculate impedance for other frequencies.",How to Measure Speaker Impedance2," A speaker's impedance varies with frequency, so you'll need a tool that allows you to send out a sine wave at any given frequency. An audio frequency oscillator is the most accurate option. Any signal generator or function generator with a sine wave or sweep function will work, but some models may give inaccurate results due to changing voltages or poor sine wave approximation.If you are new to audio tests or DIY electronics, consider audio testing tools that connect to a computer. These are often less accurate, but novices may appreciate the auto-generated graphs and data., Look for the power on the amp label or spec sheet in watts RMS. Higher power amplifiers produce more accurate measurements with this test., This test is part of a standard series of tests to measure the ""Thiele-Small parameters."" All of these tests were designed for low voltages.Lower the gain on your amp while a voltmeter set to AC voltage is connected to the amp's output terminals. Ideally the voltmeter should read somewhere between 0.5 and 1 V, but if you don't have sensitive tools, just set it to below 10 volts.


Some amps produce inconsistent voltage at low frequencies, which is a common source of inaccuracy in this test. For best results, check with the voltmeter to make sure the voltage stays constant as you adjust the frequency using the sine wave generator.
Use the highest quality multimeter you can afford. The inexpensive models tend to be less accurate for the measurements later in this test. It may help to purchase higher quality multimeter leads at an electronics store., Find the power rating (in watts RMS) closest to your amplifier's on the list below. Choose a resistor with the recommended resistance, and the listed wattage rating or higher. The resistance doesn't need to be exact, but if it's too high, you may clip the amplifier and disrupt the test. Too low, and your results will be less accurate.100W amp: 2.7k Ω resistor rated to at least 0.50W
90W amp: 2.4k Ω, 0.50W
65W amp: 2.2k Ω, 0.50W
50W amp: 1.8k Ω, 0.50W
40W amp: 1.6k Ω, 0.25W
30W amp: 1.5k Ω, 0.25W
20W amp: 1.2k Ω, 0.25W

, This may vary slightly from the printed resistance. Write down the measured value.

, Hook the speaker up to the amplifier, with the resistor between them. This creates a constant current source powering the speaker.

, Wind or reflected sound waves could disrupt this sensitive test. At minimum, keep the speaker magnet side down (cone up), in a windless area. If high accuracy is required, bolt the speaker to an open frame, with no solid objects within 2 ft (61 cm) in any direction., Using Ohm's Law (I = V / R or current = voltage / resistance), calculate the current and write it down. Use the resistor's measured resistance for R.


For example, if the resistor has a measured resistance of 1230 ohms, and the voltage source is 10 volts, the current I = 10/1230 = 1/123 amps. You can leave this as a fraction to avoid rounding errors.

, Set the sine wave generator to a frequency at the mid or upper range of the speaker's intended use. (100 Hz is a good starting point for bass units.) Place an AC voltmeter across the speaker. Adjust the frequency downward about 5 Hz at a time, until you see the voltage rise sharply. Tweak the frequency back and forth until you find the frequency where the voltage is highest. This is the resonance frequency of the speaker in ""free air"" (an enclosure and surrounding objects will change this).


You can use an oscilloscope instead of a voltmeter. In this case, find the voltage associated with the greatest amplitude.

, You can substitute impedance Z for resistance in Ohm's Law. Calculate Z = V / I to find the impedance at resonance frequency. This should be the maximum impedance your speaker will encounter in the intended audio range.


For example, if I = 1/123 amps and the voltmeter measures 0.05V (or 50mV), then Z = (0.05) / (1/123) = 6.15 ohms.

, To find the impedance across the speaker's intended frequency range, adjust the sine wave in small increments. Record the voltage at each frequency, and use the same calculation (Z = V / I) to find the speaker's impedance at each frequency. You may find a second peak, or the impedance may be fairly steady once you get away from the resonance frequency.

Cover a floor with an area rug to disguise cords and reduce tripping hazards.,
Consult with a contractor about cutting holes in the dry wall.",How to Hide Cables2," People who require a lot of surge protectors, modems, hard drives and other computer devices can string them to a piece of pegboard cut to the size of your desk. Place the pegboard inside a closet or mount it behind your desk.


Use plastic zip ties to keep all the devices secure. Zip ties come in white, grey, black or other colors that match flooring and walls.
Make sure the pegboard gets plenty of air, so that your electronics don’t overheat.

, Any cords that run the same length from the outlet to the device can be strapped into one solid cord with zip ties. This will allow you to pick up the cord bundle and clean behind it.

, Home improvement stores sell corner, wall and floor molds that install over the cords and onto the wall. Paint the mold to match your wall color, so that it looks like part of the wall’s molding.

, Purchase a rubber or plastic protector that matches your flooring. Then, insert the cables into the bottom and stretch it along the wall or between rooms.


The protector is designed to reduce tripping hazards. They are available in many colors and lengths.

, Measure the space that you need to cover between the outlet and the appliance. Cut a piece of durable material in a matching color to the exact length and a six-inch (15.2cm) width.


Hem several lengths together for very long cord covers.
Place double-sided tape on the edges of the fabric at the ends. Fold them over, and then stitch a seam with one-inch (2.5cm) stitches through the tape.
Sew Velcro hook across the entire length of the cord protector on both sides. Make sure you sew on the topside of your protector.
Attach double-sided tape to the back of the fabric. It should be applied along the entire length on both sides. Fold the Velcro inward, so that it is on the bottom side of the fabric.
Sew a hem through the fabric about one inch (2.5cm) from the edge.
Wrap the cover over the cords and press it down onto the looped carpet, where it will adhere until you want to remove it., Make sure it extends from the outlet to a piece of furniture against a wall, so that you can hide the cord completely.

, In some places, you can cut a hole near the outlet and a hole near the device and loop your cables through the back of the wall. Don’t knock holes into the wall until you are sure the structure isn’t load-bearing or until you have the appropriate tools.

Make sure you have good bass and treble.,
Position them in the corners of the room, facing the front of the audience.

,
Keep your subwoofer simple.,
Make sure that the box is ported.",How to Pick Speakers for a Home Audio System2," For your speakers, try getting tall, narrow boxes with 2-3 speakers in them. Make sure the speakers are at least 2 inches, and no larger than 6 inches (15.2 cm).

,, For your subwoofer, you won't need anything more powerful than a 600 watt sub. Try out an 8 inch or 10 inch from Kenwood, Sony, BOSS, or Alpine. This should provide enough bass for the small party or home theatre.

, Put the port and speaker facing the front, with the port under the speaker itself. Place the subwoofer in the front center of the room, in between the 2 speaker sets.

Keep your personal stereo system simpler.,
Place them on a table or shelf, but so that the sound travels all throughout the room.,
Consider a subwoofer.,
Put it in a ported or sealed box, whichever you choose.",How to Pick Speakers for a Home Audio System3," You won't need something that thumps so hard it rattles the windows, and has such good treble that it screams at the top of its lungs if you have a bookshelf setup in mind. For you speakers, use something small, no bigger than 4 inches (10.2 cm).

, Only have one speaker in each box.

, If you want to, you can skip this step. A subwoofer isn't necessary for a personal stereo. If you do choose to get one, however, try a 6 inch, or maybe even an 8 inch. Try something from BOSS, Alpine, or Sony.

, Put it against a wall, in the center of it specifically.

Position your speakers correctly.,
Assume the room is divided into three sections.,
Be sure to have space the wall and the speakers.,
know your geometry.,
Have the speakers at about eye level.,
If you do not have stands and instead are placing speakers on a desk or on end tables, pad the bottom with some foam, a thick blanket or cloth.",How to Make the Most Out of Home Audio Equipment,"


If the room is rectangular in shape, your speakers should face the length of the room. Position your couch or desk facing the shortest end of the wall. This will allow you to sit directly in the aim of the speakers.;
, The speakers should sit in the first third of the room facing away from the wall.


The speakers, assuming the room is large enough, should each be positioned a little more than three feet away from the long sides of the wall.

, Key to positioning home audio speakers is a need for space between the speakers and the wall. This is because the rattle of the bass can easily bounce off of a nearby wall, distorting the sound.

, While positioning your speakers at an exact angle is difficult to do, anyone can eyeball an angle of roughly 60 degrees. This sixty degree angle will help offer the best use of most music and many films’ stereo sound. With pro audio equipment you will find that the angle helps you hear intricacies you might have otherwise never heard.


Your subwoofer should be at least 30 centimeters (11.8 in) from the wall. Do not place it in the dead center of the wall.

, Speaker stands should be adjusted to just about your eye level.

, This will keep these items from becoming bass boosting, sound distorting annoyances.


Surround sound home theater equipment has some slightly different rules than stereo speakers. The center channel should be placed directly in front of your primary seating place. Each speaker should be placed 110 degrees away from each other and should be approximately equal distance from where you plan to sit.

, Other than guessing the most obvious passwords, there are a few tricks that are used by professional password guessers. They know, for example, that there's at least a 50% chance that a user's password will have one or more vowels. Here are a few other tricks that you should know:If the password has a number in it, it will be usually be a 1 or a 2 and it will be at the end of the password.
If there's a capital letter in the password, it will usually be at the beginning -- often followed by a vowel.

, See if the password has to be a certain length (typically passwords have to be at least 6 characters long), and if it has to have at least one number or one symbol or a special character. If you're not sure, you can try setting up your own account at the site where you're trying to guess the password from, and you'll be told the requirements of the password.

, If the password has a ""hint"" option, then ask for a hint to guide you in guessing the password. The hint question can be something like, ""What is your mother's maiden name?"" or ""What is the name of your first pet?"" These questions can help narrow down your guessing; though you may not know the name of the person's first pet, you can guess from a number of pet names. Or, if you want to be extra sneaky, you can try to bring up first pets in a conversation with that person.


The hint can narrow down your search quite a bit if you know some personal information about that person. For example, if the question is, ""Where were you born?"" you may already know the person's birth state -- or even his birth city.

Guess the person's favorite things.",How to Guess a Password2," Many people, and especially women, have personal names in their passwords. Most people wouldn't put their own names in a password, but you could try those anyway. Here are some other names to try when you're guessing a password:


The name of the person's significant other or spouse
The names of the person's siblings
The name of the person's current or favorite pet
The name of the person's (especially a male's) favorite athlete
The person's childhood nickname or current nickname

, You can also guess a password by thinking of the person's hobbies or interests. Here are some tricks to try:


Try combining a man's favorite athlete with his favorite sport. For example: ""Tigergolf"" or ""Kobebball.""
Guess the name of a woman's favorite TV show, or the name of a favorite character on that show.
Guess the name of a person's favorite athletic hobby. If the person loves to swim, try ""Swimmer"" with some numbers after it.

, Many people use numbers in their password, indicating a date or a lucky number. Some people even make their whole password consist of numbers. You can try these numbers on their own, or add them to the end of one of the words that you guessed. Here are some ways to guess a person's password based on numbers:


Guess the person's birthday. For example, if the person's birthday is 12/18/75, type in ""121875"" or ""12181975.""
Try the person's street address. The person's street address, such as 955, could be a part of the password.
Try the person's lucky number. If the person has been vocal about what his lucky number is, try it.
If the person played a sport, try his jersey number as part of the password.
Try a part of the person's phone number.
Try the person's graduating class from college or high school.

, You can also guess the person's password by guessing from a number of the person's favorite things. Here are a few favorite things to try:

Radio control, or RC, vehicles such as boats, cars, helicopters and planes are a hobby and should not be thought of as toys.,
Firstly, do not buy anything spontaneously!,
“Beware of counterfeit products Most manufacturers have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars over many years to develop and build a range of quality products and therefore establishing a good name for themselves within the RC industry.,
You get what you pay for!,
Technology is always changing.,
Do your homework.,
It is not our purpose to recommend any particular manufacturers/brands within these pages, however there are a lot of choices out there and many reputable manufacturers.",How to Get Started in Radio Control," Today there are massive numbers of cheaply priced radio control products on the market which lure both adults and children into the world of RC. However, it is definitely buyer beware when it comes to purchasing a RC product that is not a recognised brand name within the particular sector of the hobby you are interested in. But how do you know what is a recognisable brand? What makes a vehicle good and another bad? Hopefully these and more questions will be answered in this article.;
, There are many temptations presented before us by major chain stores, shopping centre kiosks, local markets and online. There is nothing necessarily wrong with these products. They look fantastic in their packaging and there might even be a person operating one. It seems to work well, looks easy to use and best of all the price is right!

, Because of this investment it is in their best interest to continue providing quality Radio Control products and service. New companies are emerging almost daily offering new products some of may have become very successful over time. Unfortunately, most are often nothing more than copies of successful originals. If two items from two different manufacturers look identical and there is a difference in the price, quality has almost certainly been sacrificed.

, Everything we buy as consumers is manufactured for a price. In Radio Control this is no different and as a general rule the cheaper the product is to purchase the more likely it is to be a disposable item rather than a repairable one. Because less expensive RC products are manufactured for a target market, rectifying a design fault and supplying individual spare parts are just not part of a manufacturers overall marketing strategy. Alternatively you may find spare parts are available and reasonably priced. A couple of clicks over the internet and the parts are on their way. The issue is that you may find yourself “clicking” very often and/or replacing the same part over and over. Aside from failures due to poor design, the quality of the plastics and metals can be too flexible or too brittle. Electronic components are often very basic, poorly made and their ability to power and control your RC vehicle are borderline at best (power versus weight versus environment). The three biggest enemies of any electronic component are water, vibration and impact. Experience has shown that more cheaply manufactured components are much more susceptible to failure when exposed to any of these elements. Replacing any type of electronic is never a cheap exercise.

, Make sure you are buying today’s technology, not yesterday's.

, Visit hobby stores, buy a hobby magazine or two, talk to local hobby clubs or enthusiasts and look around on the internet. Go to manufacturers' websites and read forums about the product you are interested in. It is important to ask questions and be sure that you are making the best, most informed decision you can. Most people who are in a hobby are more than willing to share their knowledge and experience.

, Their products typically range from a medium to high-end, t have full spare parts backup, technical support and, if you purchase from within Australia, are backed by an Australian warranty.

If you have gotten this far and you still have no sound, it may not be a simple fix.",How to Get Sound on Your Computer," Any should work if you are not concerned with the sound quality.;
, This is probably one of the most common reasons for no sound coming out of your speakers. Unmute is usually found at the bottom right of your computer screen and looks like a speaker with a X through it.

, Check the connections on the back or front of the computer. Also, some speakers require a power source, so make sure that it is connected to a power outlet and connected to the speakers., Somehow, your sound card drivers may have been deleted. Replacing them is outside the scope of this article.

Decide why you want to do a Technology Cleanse.,
Decide how long you will do the cleanse.,
Decide what technology you will put away during the cleanse.,
Inform your family, friends and contacts.,
Tie-up loose ends.,
Make a plan.,
Now you are ready!",How to Go on a Technology Cleanse," Maybe you feel like you spend too much time on the phone for useless reasons. Or, maybe you play too many computer games. You may want to simply ""get back to the basics"". Write it down, and keep it on your bathroom mirror, wallet, or any other place that you will see it daily. That way, when you have the urge to check your email and are frustrated, you can remind yourself of why you are doing this in the first place.;
, Maybe you want to be really radical, and go for a month. Maybe you want to do a shorter (more reasonable, maybe) time period like a week. Decide when this time frame will start and end. But, leave yourself 2-3 days before the cleanse in order to prepare. It's not a good idea to start immediately or the next day.

, Maybe you are going all out; no cell phone, no computer, no mp3 player, zippo! Maybe you'd like to just give up one thing that is particularly distracting you i.e. your phone, your blackberry, etc.

, Remember, you may be the only one doing the cleanse during the time period you have chosen. That means that there are people out there who depend on you to answer your email right away, or who will assume they can contact you immediately on your cell phone. You will need to contact the people you normally communicate with using these various forms of technology and let them know your intentions. This will prevent someone from sending you an important email and expecting an immediate response. For example, if you are an avid Facebook user, update your status with your dates of the the cleanse and what it will entail. You may also want to send a reminder message to your friends on Facebook the day before your cleanse and give them an alternate form of contact in case of an emergency. Or if you are a constant ""texter"" you may want to send out a mass text to your contacts in your phone letting them know that they will not be able to contact you in this form for your specified time period. Again, give them an alternate form of contact in case of an emergency.

, Take a look at your calendar during your proposed cleanse time-frame. Make sure that there isn't anything you are required to do using the technology you are cleansing yourself of during that time. Maybe someone will be expecting an email from you during that time, or a phone call. Are you backed up on email responses? Take the time now, before your cleanse, to take care of these items ahead of time. Either do these tasks now, or let that person know when they can expect them to be done. This will allow your mind to be free of to-do's during your cleanse. And, it will keep people from being mad at you for ignoring deadlines.

, Now you are almost ready! Plan what you will do instead of using technology. Lets say you are planning on ditching your mp3 player that you normally listen to in your car on your way to work. In this case, find a book you've always wanted to read and get it on audio CD or tape and listen to that instead. Or, maybe you are keeping from checking your email. Plan to write an old fashioned letter instead. Find a nice card and send it to someone. Thank them for their support during your cleanse.

, Put the dates on your calendar and go for it! Your mind, body and soul with thank you for it.

Learn some basic electronic principles before purchasing the actual board.,
Find out about different Arduino boards.,
Purchase the board you have decided on.,
Start using the board.,
Join the community.",How to Get Started with Arduino,"


These include Ohm's law, breadboard basics, reading resistors and the use of electronic components such as LEDs, piezos, transistors and switches.
This information is easily available on YouTube and the Internet. A series of tutorials by Jeremy Blum on YouTube provide ample information on both the Arduino and electronics basics.;
,


Varieties include the Arduino Uno (which most beginners use), the Arduino Mega (With more input and output pins) and the Arduino Lilypad.
As the Arduino is open-source technology, many companies produce clone boards, which come at a cheaper price or with different functions.

,


These can be bought online on websites such as eBay, Amazon, Adafruit, element14 and many others. Real life shops such as Radio Shack also sell Arduinos.
Purchasing them in kits which include electronic components is also a good option, as they eliminate the need of finding more components elsewhere. These kits normally include the board itself, a breadboard for prototyping, some wires, a USB cable to program it with a computer and some LEDs, resistors, motors and the like.

,


Many projects with the Arduino can be found online. These include LED cubes, robots, simple motor movement projects and even a fart detection module!
Learning the programming language is also an advantage as you will not need to rely on other peoples' code and can instead program your board on your own.

,


Joining a Makerspace, writing on forums and making tutorial videos of your own are great ways to merge yourself with the quickly growing open-source electronics community.

Take the drive to a data recovery specialist.",How to Get Deleted Files Back from USB or Hard Drive," the pointers have been removed and the data is waiting to be overwritten. The chances of recovering the files you want go down significantly if you keep accessing the drive you are trying to recover from. Adding and removing more data can corrupt the data of the files you are trying to recover from. To maximize your chances, don’t save or download anything you don’t need., There are plenty of paid programs out there that advertise their ability to recover files, but there are lots of free programs available that work just as well in almost all cases. Read reviews and find the program that is best for you. Popular free file-recovery programs include:


Puran File Recovery
Glary Undelete
Recuva
Restoration

, Do not download to the drive that you need to recover from. Ideally, download the portable version of the program on another computer and copy it to a USB drive. This will ensure that no data is written to the drive that you need to recover files from.


Portable programs do not need to be installed, and can be run from a USB drive or any other location.
Not all file-recovery programs offer portable versions.

, If you have a portable file-recovery program, insert the USB drive in the computer you want to recover on, and run the program. If you’ve installed a file-recovery program, run it.


Most programs will be able to recover from both hard drives and USB drives, so you don’t need to download separate programs for each one.

, Not all recovery programs will ask for this, and it is not necessary even if they do, but it can speed up the search if you narrow the field.

, If you are trying to recover files from a hard drive, make sure that you have the correct drive selected. If recovering files from a USB drive, make sure the drive is inserted and then select it from the list.

, Some programs will allow you to preview the files it is able to recover. Look for the file you need and follow the program’s specific instructions on how to recover it.


Some programs will be able to restore the file to its original location.
Many files will not be 100% recoverable. This is because entire files aren’t always written to the exact same location on the disk, so parts may get overwritten. Files that are not 100% will often not be able to be opened.

, If your drive is non-functional, a data-recovery program will not work because it needs to be able to access the drive. In order to attempt to recover data from a dead drive, you will need to take it a professional who is equipped with the lab and tools necessary to extract the plates from the drive and recover the data.

Know your price range.,
How are you going to use it.,
When you do get it, check for any defects.,
Search for things better then it before its too late.",How to Get the Best Camcorder for You," It's often very important to know how big your camcorder is. If it's too small, you will probably get self conscious about it and if it's too big it will be a pain to carry around. So instead, check it before you buy it.;
, Things like Manual Exposure Control is very important. Night vision is not that important just if you usually record in the dark it would be best to have a kind of light such as a video light. Zooming in is something a camcorder should usually have in the first place but if it does not have vital things such as Manual Exposure Control or no image stabilization or a video light you should try getting something else. You can easily find a camcorder with all these things fairly cheap at Best Buy.


The resolution and LCD size. These may be the most important things on a camcorder Resolution is for starters the measurement of the number of horizontal and vertical lines. The higher these numbers are, the higher the quality of video. Any resolution over 1280x720 will generally be considered HD. This is just for starters 1280x720 on YouTube is 720p any higher is 1080p the p stands for Pixels. the LCD size is how big the lens is... Or basically where you record from which for starters is the circle thingy that captures what you are recording. The average size of the LCD is around 2 inches (5.1 cm).
How large the memory is. Memory is basically how much videos you can have on your camcorder Gigabytes is 1000 megabytes Megabytes are fairly small and Gigabytes are quite big. 8 Is fairly large but if you want to record a lot you may need 16. However your camcorder can have flash memory meaning you can move all your memory into an SD card or USB stick Flash memory is generally better because it has no moving parts meaning it has a longer battery life. They are also lightweight cause flash memory is lighter than a hard disk. The main problem is they don't have much memory (Gigabytes) The max you can have is 64 GB but the average person does not use that much space but it is good to have lots... Though hard disks can carry a whopping 200 GB.

, If you already have digital products, you might have a preference. Otherwise, get what works best for you.

, The average price rang of camcorders on a scale is 100 at its very cheapest to 1099 at its most expensive. The average camcorders that you want to get for moderate use ranges from 170 to 299. But you ghost hunters Night vision EVP included camcorder is around 1099 and these are very unnecessary for average use such as blogging.

, As you approach the Deku Tree, you'll notice a bunch of Chuchus will appear on it. To help the Deku Tree (and therefore earn the Deku Leaf), you'll need to get rid of these Chuchus.


You can get the Chuchus off of the Deku Tree by using a roll attack aimed at the tree trunk.
To use a rolling attack, run at the tree and as you're running press the ""A"" button on your controller to perform a roll.
The roll attack will knock the Chuchus off of the tree.
Once the Chuchus are off of the Deku Tree, you can then use your sword to attack and kill them.
If there are any more Chuchus after the tree when you have killed all the ones you knocked off, then just repeat the process to get rid of the rest of them.

, To the left of the tree you'll notice that there is a purple flower bud. This is called a baba bud and it will launch you up into the air when you jump on it.


If you don't touch the D-pad when you're in the air, the baba buds will launch you straight up and then you'll fall straight back down, landing on the bud again.
You can use this to your advantage so that you can see where you're going.
You'll need to jump from bud to bud in order to climb all the way to the top of the Deku Tree.

, When you reach the top of the Deku Tree, you should see the Deku Leaf. Simply walk up to it to collect it.

To get there, move five map tiles north from Outset Island, the starting point. On the fifth tile, move four map tiles east. You’ll eventually find a mountain island with a dragon sitting at the top.

, Open your item menu by pressing the Start button on your GameCube controller. Then, using the arrow keys, select the Grappling Hook from the list of items and press the X, Y, or Z button on your controller to equip the Hook and return to the game.


The Grappling Hook is a short hook with a long rope attached to it. It is given to you by Medli, a non-playable female character living on the Great Sea. The Grappling Hook is primarily used to reach targets from afar.

, Once the Bokoblins approaches you, press the button where you equipped the Grappling Hook to fire it at the incoming enemies. The hook will hit the Bokoblins and come back to you with a Joy Pendant attached to it. Repeat the same step with the other Bokoblin.

, After getting the Joy Pendant from the Bokoblins, head out the room through the opening you came in. Once you’re outside, reenter the room once more to find the two Bokoblins again.

, Just use the Grappling Hook again to grab Joy Pendants from the two Bokoblins, exit and enter the room, and repeat until you get your desired number of Joy Pendants. You can always get a Joy Pendant from the two Bokoblins as long as you don’t kill them. If you do kill these two monsters, they will spawn back every time you enter the room but will no longer give out Joy Pendants.

Learn about the Budweiser Shootout.,
Race in the ""Big League"".,
The race proper for year 1 is just to win from the back of the grid, but in year 2, assuming you have won that race, you must make a 7-lap race count by making a compulsory pit-stop that changes 2 tires.

,
Set the car up for the race.,
From year 2 onwards, you should take to the pits at the end of lap 1, and change two tires only.,
Gain as many positions without enforcing a yellow flag.,
Drive your heart out once you leave the pit stop area as if you are going for an extended qualifying session.,
Celebrate after your victories.",How to Win the Budweiser Shootout in Nascar 07," According to Wikipedia, Sprint All-Star Race is the annual race that is held in Daytona. This race is available to all pole winners in 2005 season (season 1), and the 2005 winner of the shootout that had not gotten pole last season. You will be qualifying from the back of the grid just to make the grid as a Wild card entry the day before.;
, To race in the All-Star Race in 2006, gain an average of Gold in the All-State Qualifiers at the beginning so you can drive for a Sprint Cup team to race as a driver. If you are an owner, upgrade your pit crew even if you are using unlimited fuel and tires and racing in minimum number of laps (which is what this page is assumed). The reason will become clear later.

,, The set up should serve you well for the week, and also the week after that. This is a non-championship race that has no championship points at stake, but next week's race at the same circuit does (Daytona 500). So set it up well.

, You can get away with speeding into the pit. The track is long enough for you to not be down by a lap. You can have team controls, so this is the only race (if you are on unlimited fuel and tyres) to change one of the orders to 'pit now'.

, The best call is to pit earlier than everybody else. Pit after lap 1 because most never pit until laps 3-6. Your pit crew (even on perfect upgrade) needs a little more than 10 seconds to change two tires... and that is not including the time you get into the pit lane at 70 mph (110 km/h) or less (or else you incur a time penalty), and out of it in full speed.

, When the others pit, you'll catch up to them if you drive cleanly. You may not know your track position with all the shuffling going on, but you should win comfortably if you pit early and keep the pace up.

, If you win, you've guaranteed yourself entry in this event for the next year unless if you win again to extend the free pass. However, don't get complacent. As mentioned above, the race has no bearing on the Sprint Championship. On the next week, you will have a proper race weekend here (""Daytona 500""). But of course, with a car nicely set-up, and you knowing the track very well, winning again 'should' be easier, unless if any rivals you made are trying to shunt you off. In this case, it's just like a normal weekend. Qualify well in the two laps given, then stay out of trouble to win. And DO NOT pit. Nobody will in a short race, and you'll be left behind.

Take careful aim and fire, the rockets explode will explode in close proximity but not if you are off by a large distance.

,
The helicopter will now stop flying and will now fall from the sky, beware however, the helicopter can still shoot it's missiles.

,
If the helicopter did not explode upon impact with the ground, run towards it and start raining fire and explosives on it.

,
Begin searching for your next victim.

,
The same result can be achieved with the jet, but results are much harder to come by as the jet is much faster and harder to get an accurate shot, but the results are incredibly worth it.

Ceasefire zones.,
Always be ready.,
Check your map.,
Check your guns.,
Plan your arsenal.,
Save bullets.,
Listen.,
Stealth.,
It's Africa.",How to Survive Far Cry 2," Most towns in the game are ceasefire zones, meaning, the soldiers there won't shoot at you; but do not shoot while in a zone (unless you want to create chaos) or all the soldiers will come after you.;
, It's a dog-eat-dog game; even if you're cruising down a remote path, always look out for patrolling jeeps. They always attack you.

, Your map shows guerrilla camps and safe-houses. If you are not looking for a fight, avoid the camps. Be warned, most intersections have camps.

, The Older your gun is, the more likely it will jam or even blow up. Always visit the gun dealers and get fresh guns and ammo.

, Be smart about gun combos. Most sniper rifles won't do well in a firefight, so a good combo is a handgun, a sniper and a machine gun. See point 6.

, It will happen that you'll just injure an enemy. If this happens, they will be vulnerable for a moment. In that time, kill them using your handgun so that you can save bullets for your main gun. If you don't kill them, they'll get up and start shooting again.

, This point can really save your skin in later parts of the game. If you're hiding, listen to what they are saying and listen from which way it's coming from. Later in the game, they will begin using mortars. They normally use it when you're in a vehicle. They are very accurate and if you don't pay attention, you'll be blown to bits. Only way you'll know if one's coming is by the whistle it gives off. If you hear it, turn as fast as you can and head in another direction.

, Stealth is always on your side. If you ever watched the predator movies, you can get a good feeling of being one by playing Far Cry 2. Stalk your enemies, use tall grass, rocks and buildings to hide. This way, you can pick your enemies off one by one; they sometimes begin to panic.

, Use your environment; set everything on fire and flush them out.

Use the Assault Rifle at short to mid range.,
Drain the enemy's shields.,
Go up to your enemy and melee them which will lower their shields.,
Shoot in short controlled bursts (3 rounds).",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics1,";
, When an enemy comes rushing up to you just unload your assault rifle's magazine on him/her. This will lower their shields and create enough damage to your opponent for your kill shot.


Quickly change to your secondary weapon and finish the kill.
Strike your opponent when their shield and health is down. It only takes one melee strike from your weapon to kill most opponents.

, After that just shoot them. It only takes about roughly 23-27 bullets to kills a Spartan with full shields, and about 13-20 bullets to kill one with their shields down.

, If you are shooting from medium range with the Assault Rifle shoot in short bursts. It will kept recoil to a minimum while retaining accuracy and saving your ammo.

Create your player.,
After you've created your player, you need to go through training camp.,
Now it's time to add your attributes.,
Once you've added your attributes, it's time to pick who you want to play for.,
Finally, the most important step, performing as a student and an athlete.",How to Succeed at Campus Legend in NCAA Football 07," Some find it fun to create themselves, others like to create their own unique person. Whatever works for you is fine. You can edit the player's appearance (i.e. skin color, hair color and style, etc.) in this screen. You can also edit their name and hometown while creating your player.;
, Training camp allows you to receive bonus attribute points that will later go into building up your players attributes. There are five (5) events, and you can earn up to 80 bonus points.

, The more attribute points you earned in training camp, the higher your players overall rating will go. The higher your overall rating, the higher caliber you are (i.e. 5 star, 4 star, etc.) Players with a higher caliber have the option of choosing any school they want.

, Based on your caliber, you will be given a list of schools. Be careful though, you can only pick what school you go to once.

, In order to become a campus legend, you have to be both a good student and athlete. If you are successful in that, you will become a campus legend.

Zoom in and scan the area around you for enemies to shoot at.

,
Shoot the enemy when someone is charging at you.,
Zoom in and take a look around if you see an enemy at medium to long range.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics2,", More than likely if your enemy does not have a DMR then you have the advantage in most cases because the DMR only takes five shoots to kill a Spartan III and six to kill an Elite (assuming the last shot was a headshot). Just unload until his/her shields are down and get the headshot.

, Then start shooting them. Pace your shots. Wait 1 second after each shot to let your reticle reset then shoot again and again until there shields are down.

"
"
Shoot the enemy if you see him and he is close to you.

,
Pull out your rocket launcher and wait until the reticle turns red.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics3,", When it does wait a few more seconds and then a diamond/square shape box will appear that means you are locked on. When this happens, shoot a single rocket (as it only requires one to kill). Then, if you're unsuccessful, keep the target locked on and fire again.

"
"
Overcharge the pistol and then shoot it at an enemy.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics4," This will drain their shields and in return, if you have a DMR or a pistol, an easy head shot. Or if you don't have any of these weapons then you could use any weapon to easily kill your enemy.

"
"
Shoot your weapon, making sure to lead the target.,
Hold in your firing trigger.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics5," If they are moving, aim up to account for the drop.



Note: The grenade will bounce and could come back and end up hurting or killing you.
Becoming extremely accurate with this gun while using this basic fire mode will make you deadly as the Grenade Launcher is available on a large percentage of the maps, and is a starting weapon for Stage 3 Invasion.

, This allows you to be in a hiding place and shoot your Grenade Launcher. When someone comes close to your grenade, just release the firing button and you either have a kill or have injured your opponent. The Grenade Launcher also releases an EMP with this method, disabling vehicles temporarily to allow to to run away or board/destroy.

"
"
Shoot in short controlled burst when you are shooting the plasma repeater.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics6," Not only will that reduce the amount of waste the Plasma Repeater builds up but will also make your shoots that more deadly. In terms of damage per bullet, the Plasma Repeater takes exactly 18 direct hits to kill, identical to the AR.



Note Plasma does not work well on unshielded enemies.

"
Practice offline with friends locally before you pick up a sniper rifle.,
Try to go for the headshot.

,
Use Sniper Rifle as a last-ditch defense against vehicles.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics7," This will allow you to get a feeling of how to use the sniper rifle. So if you see a sniper rifle laying on the ground in multiplayer match making let a more experienced person with this weapon have it!

,,



Note: This is not recommended as it is a waste of ammo and takes many hits to destroy a vehicle.

"
"
Use any other weapon for an example.,
Time your shots.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics8," Use your Assault Rifle and shoot at your enemy until their shields are down and pull out your pistol and shoot them in the head and you have a kill.

, Making sure for the reticle doesn't not expand. It will take 5 shots to kill (4 to take down shields, last one for the unshielded head).

"
"
Shoot all your needles into your enemy's body.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics9," This will allow you to do a super-combine explosion when there shields are all way down. Make sure to lead the target if they are moving as the Needler's homing ability is not sufficient to take down a sprinting enemy.

"
"
Shoot your enemy when his shields fall.,
Shoot them in the head.,
Hold fire down.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics10," Shoot him/her in the body three times and the result will be a super combine explosion.

, When you get your enemy's shields down you can just try a headshot.

, In ""Title-Updated"" gametypes holding fire down will cause the Needler to fire much faster and will not loose any accuracy if you are stationary.

"
"
Shoot your enemy up close.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics11," You don't need skill to use this weapon ether just shoot the enemy when they are close to you, and in about 1 to 3 shots you got yourself an easy kill.


Be that aware veteran Halo players are good at countering a shotgun.

"
"
Lock on to anyone as your are about to die.,
Lock on to vehicles.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics12," You only need to shoot one Plasma Launcher round to kill a Spartan or Elite. So shoot only as you are about to die. So that way not only did they kill you but you also killed them and you got a ""Kill From The Grave Metal"".

, Plus it homes in on your target so lock on to any vehicle and wait until all four shots are charged up then shoot it will home in on your target (this goes for players too).



Note: If an enemy goes behind a wall most likely your charges will miss.

"
"
Pick it up.,
Be a ninja.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics13," Pretty much you always want to kept this weapon away unless you are trying to kill someone. Having your Energy Sword out actually gives out light which can sometimes give you away.

,


Have Active Camo as your ability.
Have an Energy Sword ready.
When you see a red dot on your radar turn on your Active Camo and when your opponent gets close to you ""slash"" he's dead. Or you could go for an assassination by going behind them. This will prompt a special assassination animation exclusive to a Spartan holding an Energy Sword.

"
"
Shoot fully automatic with this weapon.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics14," It will quickly lower your enemy's shields and finish them off quickly.

"
"
Find one.,
Stay quite a bit from your target.,
Try to take out vehicles more then players.",How to Use Halo Weapon Tactics15," It is extremely hard to find a Spartan Laser in most multiplayer.

, It takes about a good 3.5 to 5 seconds to charge up your shots.

, This is to help your ground troops out from oncoming vehicles (this applies to campaign also).

Keep Tali alive when it comes time to choose between the Geth and the Quarians.,
Talk to Tali in the Engineering Bay after Priority: Rannoch.",How to Romance Tali in Mass Effect 3," The only way that you can start a romance with Tali in Mass Effect 3 is by starting the romance in Mass Effect 2. Tali will only start a romance with a male Shepard character. It is not possible to romance Tali in Mass Effect 3 if you do not import a file from the previous game.


To romance Tali in Mass Effect 2, you'll need to complete her Loyalty mission without handing over the evidence at the end. If you hand over the evidence, Tali will be cleared but her father will become hated. This will cause you to fail the Loyalty mission and be unable to start the romance.
Make sure to tell Tali ""I want to talk to you"" when prompted. This will lock you in to romantic relationship with her.
Continue talking to Tali until the Omega IV Relay mission. If you've progressed with the relationship far enough, you'll consummate your relationship at this point.;
, Tali needs to survive the final mission in Mass Effect 2. If she does not, she will not appear in Mass Effect 3 when you import your save file.


Ensuring that you've maxed out your loyalty with everyone is the best way to keep Tali, and the rest of your crew, alive on the final mission.
You'll need upgraded shields in order for Tali to survive.
Make sure the leader of First Fire Team is completely loyal, and that Tali is assigned to the Vents. A fully loyal Garrus is the most recommended squad leader.

, Once you've beaten Mass Effect 2 with Tali alive and romanced, you can import the save file into Mass Effect 3. You are given this option when you start a new game. You can only import files from the same console into Mass Effect 3.

, Tali will join your crew after the Priority: Geth Dreadnaught mission. Speak to her after she arrives and talk about rekindling your past relationship. Note that this does not yet lock you into starting a relationship with her.

, While you're completing various Side Missions during the war between the Quarian and the Geth, Tali will send you a message informing you that she wants to talk. Invite her to your quarters using the terminal in your cabin and reignite your past relationship by using the Paragon conversation options. If you fail to do this before Priority: Rannoch, you won't be able to romance Tali.

, After the Priority: Cerberus Headquarter mission, you can find Tali in the crew lounge. Talk to her here for more romance dialog.

, At the end of the Priority: Rannoch mission, you'll be forced to make a choice between the Quarians and the Geth. If you're just worried about keeping Tali alive, choose to side with the Quarians. If you want to keep the Geth around, you can side with them, but you'll need to meet a few requirements in order for Tali to survive the decision:You must have activated Legion in Mass Effect 2, as well as completed his Loyalty mission.
You must have completed the ""Geth Fighter Squadron"" mission.
Earned five ""points"" by completing some or all of the following tasks: Saved the Admiral during the Rannoch mission (1); Completed ""Rannoch Admiral Koris"" (1); Saved Tali from Exile in ME2 (2); Brokered peace between Tali and Legion in ME2 (2); Destroyed the Heretic Geth during Legion's loyalty mission in ME2 (2).
You must have four bars of either Paragon or Renegade reputation.

, If you've met all of the romance requirements up to this point, you will receive a gift from Tali when you talk to her in Engineering. This is a picture of her without her helmet, and you can find it in your cabin."

Anthology 1 is Romeo and Juliet
Anthology 2 is King Lear
Anthology 3 is Macbeth
Anthology 4 is Hamlet
Anthology 5 is Othello

,


This stanza mentions “The first words at thy left hand.”
This is an instruction for solving the puzzle; meaning you’ll need to arrange the books from left to right.

, The first stanza mentions “false lunacy” and “incomprehensible words,” which is a reference to the plot of Hamlet.

, The second stanza is the easiest to decipher “playing at death” and “nameless lover” refers to the last part of Romeo and Juliet.

, This stanza is a reference to Othello, referring to the innocence of Desdemona and the lies of Iago.

, This stanza refers to the story of King Lear, where his daughter Cordelia refuses to speak about how much she loves her father as opposed to the false flattery of her sisters.

,


And with all 5 books on the bookshelf you would have the correct code.

, 41523 is not the pass code; on the sixth stanza, you will be instructed to more.


“41523—One vengeful man spilled blood for two” (Hamlet). This means you will have to double Hamlet, which is Anthology 4. Now our code is 81523.
“81523—Two youths shed tears for 3”; this refers to Romeo and Juliet, so you must replace 1 with 3. Our code now is 83523.
Finally, “3 witches disappear” (reference to Macbeth), which is Anthology 3. You’ll have to remove it from the code. The final pass code is 8352.

,

Play through story mode.,
Collect mini-kits.,
Collect power bricks.,
Free the hostages.,
Play the bonus missions.",How to Play LEGO Batman: The Videogame," There are 30 stories divided into six episodes of five chapters each. During the first three episodes, you play Batman and attempt to foil the villains. During the last three episodes you play the villains and attempt to foil the Batman. There are two goals to achieve while playing through story mode.


Complete the mission and thereby unlock several things: (1) free play for the level completed, (2) the corresponding villain level, (3) the next level and (4) extra characters or vehicles. The chart below illustrates which characters and vehicles are unlocked at each chapter.
Collect LEGO studs to achieve superhero or super villain status. The number of studs required to achieve this status varies in each chapter, but the studs are color coded by value: silver studs are worth 10 points, gold studs are worth 100 points, blue studs are worth 1,000 points and purple studs are worth 10,000 points. This goal can also be completed in free play. When you achieve. superhero status in all 15 chapters, you will unlock the bonus mission: Wayne Manor, accessible from the trophy room. Likewise, when you complete super villain status in all 15 chapters, you will unlock the bonus mission accessible from the trophy room at Arkham Asylum.;
, There are 10 mini-kits in each chapter for a total of 300 mini-kits. Ten mini-kits collected in one chapter will assemble into some creation for the trophy room and earn 50,000 points. It is possible to find some of the mini-kits during story mode, but some mini-kits can only be found in free play and even then you need specific characters to find some mini-kits. The last mini-kit in either the Hero or Villain missions will give you 500,000 points.

, There is one power brick hidden in each chapter for a total of 30 power bricks. They are red, and like mini-kits, some are available in story mode, but most are only available in free play and even then you need specific characters to find some power bricks. Power bricks unlock suit upgrades and extras. Once you find a power brick and complete the mission, you purchase the extra back at the Bat Cave or Arkham Asylum. Some are very expensive.

, There is one hostage being held somewhere in each of the minifigure levels (not the vehicle levels). Some hostages can be set free in story mode, but many can't. Freeing all 25 hostages will unlock the character Hush, a super villain. You can keep track of which levels still have hostages that need freeing by checking for a smiley face of a frowny face in the mission map.

, There are two bonus mission: (1) Wayne Manor and (2) Arkham Asylum. Wayne Manor is unlocked by achieving superhero status in all fifteen hero levels. Arkham Asylum is unlocked by achieving super villain status in all 15 super villain levels. In Wayne Manor, you need to find 100 blue studs, total 1,000,00 points. In Arkham Asylum, you also need to collect 1,000,000 points but it's a lot easier than Wayne Manor because there are more than a 1,000,000 studs available.

Choose a faction.,
When you first start, take a moment to look over your initial forces and starting cities and castles.,
Start off with Roads and Ports.,
Keep track of your Political Affairs.,
Stay on top of your finances.",How to Play Medieval 2," Selecting a faction that best suits you is the first key step in controlling the known world. All factions have a certain advantage over others. England, has superior heavy infantry and the devastating Longbow. They lack a diverse selection of Heavy cavalry, yet their English Knights are the most destructive cavalry stat wise in the game.


Many factions prefer swords over spears, or make excellent use of Calvary, but lacks infantry.
Always go into custom battle, and preview the army list before selecting a faction and starting a game.;
,


ALWAYS be building SOMETHING. Having a turn not building a structure, is like a wasted turn.

, These add significantly to your economy and the roads boost your ground movement speed. With Castles, build roads, hold off on the ports, and go straight into military buildings. Try ground infantry and get your Barracks to a decent level, before moving onto economical/religious structure.


Take a look around your starting area, make note of the factions around you. Look for nearby rebel settlements, for these will be your targets for the turns to come.
Take your starting forces from cities (leaving peasants or other fodder to keep the happiness up) group them up with my Military leader, and strike the rebel factions. If you are wary of your neighboring factions, mercenaries are a sure way to acquire the superior troops in order to counteract other factions. Use them if you are attacked early on or decide that you wish to Blitzkrieg the game.

, While pillaging and conquering is a key component to M2TW, 95% of war is fought behind an elegant oak desk, with parchment and quill.


Politics are THE key mechanism to M2TW. As with real life, politics win and lose wars.
At the start of your turn, use your diplomat if you have one, and acquire trade rights. Always. Trade rights increase your income, thus allowing you to conquer.
If you're looking for a ""Best-Friend"" alliance, follow the next opening to win their politicians. This works around 90-95% of the time.

Note: Do not EVER trust the Holy Roman Empire, for they are very unforgiving. They tend to strike up alliances, then invade when you are the weakest. If beaten back, they tend to offer a ceasefire, alliance, trade rights...then they backdoor Jenkins rush you. Then wash and repeat. My advice, always keep your eye on the Holy Roman Empire, for they will pull a 3 war turn on you, and win.



, The ""sinews of war are infinite money."" Who ever said this never had to pay upkeep for a Crusader army of thousands! Gold, above all else, is the most important. Winning over strategic military battles and conquering Crusade targets mean nothing if you can't pay the bills. Every unit group has an upkeep, brought up by selecting the unit information, showing statistics, upkeep, etc. Now this is not drawn from one city, but pulled in fractions from multiple cites, your capital (From what I've seen) being the most heavily taxed. As in First Steps, build up roads and ports to begin. After that, for cities, build up markets, then churches for the happiness bonuses (Mosques for the Islamic factions) By the time your cities hit large and huge cities, squalor from taxes will rise, that is what the churches are for. Happiness increases with churches, thus allowing you to further tax and reap more income. There is a lot of talk saying that agricultural buildings have very little effect on the total economical expenditures during each turn. Farms significantly raise growth, thus counteracting of the population penalty for taxes. However, reserve agricultural buildings last in my build queue, for ports and merchant wharves provide oh so more gold-per-turn.

Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you kill the lava boss.",How to Kill the Lava Boss in the Legend of Zelda," Volvagia is the final boss of the Fire Temple. If you have played through the Fire Temple, you will have already acquired the boss key; use it to enter the Boss Room where the final boss is.


To find the Boss Room, head to the room on the left side from the main entrance of the temple and you should immediately see the door leading to it.;
, Once you step inside the Boss Room, the ground will start shaking and the ledge you used to get into the room will sink into the lava, leaving you standing alone on a piece of ground at the center of the room.


Volvagia will then come out of the ground and fly into the air. After the introduction, it will dive back into the ground and the battle will begin.

, The dragon will alternately pop its head out of the nine holes on the ground. A small blaze will start spouting out of a hole where its head is about to appear, making it easier to guess.


Once Volvagia’s head emerges from the ground, quickly attack it with your sword and slash away. After damaging it, the dragon will submerge back to the ground.
After taking damage, the dragon will weave its long fire mane at you. So after hitting its head a couple of times, immediately take two steps back to avoid its mane from damaging you.

, Volvagia will now emerge completely out of the ground and fly through the air. Take out your bow and arrow, aim, and shoot at the dragon’s head. Volvagia only flies very slowly so its head is very easy to target.


The lava boss will only come out of the ground and fly through the air if you’ve successfully injured it in step 3.

, After taking damage in mid-air, Volvagia will dive back into the ground and will repeat its attack style mentioned in step 3 and 4. This is the only attack pattern of Volvagia, so just repeat the strategy until the lava boss is defeated.

Master the throwing Shuriken: This plays a major role to his character.,
Deflect.,
Swift Strike.,
Activate your Dragonblade.,
Double jump and wall climb.",How to Play As Genji in Overwatch," Genji can throw two types of shurikens; each throw deals three shurikens.


By pressing down on the right trigger/Right mouse, you can throw them in a straight line, accurately hitting other players. This should be used when one character is in front and getting closer to the defense or on low health (usually three straight hits can finish off a regular 200-250 health player).
Press the left trigger/left mouse for his second throw method. This time, when Genji throws the shurikens, they arc in a cone shape. It is good for lowering health of crowded players, or just attacking for normal use. This is very effective and faster than the first method (it throws out three per second).;
, This is the best way to counter defense opponents (such as Bastion, Widowmaker, or even Tracer's ultimate). This is well-known for its powerful deflection, even deflecting many ultimates by different characters. This can be used in situations when you are on low health, or players are on low health and attacking you, or deflecting bullets for your healers or your team.

, This is very effective for low health players. You can dash towards a character and finish them off quickly with your katana, or just escape from a bad situation and travel around the map faster.

, Dragonblade combines Swift Strike with his blade Ryu-ichimonji, delivering instant killing blows. This is a very powerful ultimate when used correctly in the right situations. You can use this when your team is losing, or use it to kill players that are hard to kill in most situations. Press ""Y/Triangle/Q"" to activate the Dragonblade.

, The Shimada brothers both can wall climb; however, Genji can double jump, which means he can go to areas of the map where most heroes can't. Remember, you're the only hero that can double jump, and there is no cool down! So use it as much as you can, for example, while throwing shurikens or deflecting, it will make you a harder target to kill, or when Reinhardt is pushing you into a wall.

"
"
Get the hang of wall-climbing.,
Shoot enemies with your Storm Bow.,
Shoot Sonic arrows.,
Shoot Scatter arrows.,
Use your Dragonstrike.,
Fire from cover.",How to Play As Hanzo in Overwatch," Like his brother Genji, Hanzo has the ability to run at walls and climb up them. Run at any wall and press ""A/X""; hold that button and move the left analog stick up.;
, By pressing and holding the right trigger, Hanzo will prepare to fire an arrow at enemies. Line them up in your sights, then release the trigger.


Players in Overwatch tend to be extremely mobile, meaning you must move along with enemies' movements. Practice adjusting your aim while walking. You will need to perfect your reaction time.
Aim for headshots. These tend to do the most damage when landed.
Draw the bow all the way back before loosing arrows. This will give them max amount of power when fired.

, Press the left bumper to switch to Sonic arrows. Hanzo can use these to track enemies nearby via sonar.


While enemies are detected, use this opportunity to perhaps find a perch with a more clear view.

, Press the right bumper to switch to Scatter arrows. These arrows fragment on contact, and will ricochet off any surfaces.

, After dealing a certain amount of damage, you will unlock your Special Ability. Press ""Y/Triangle"" to switch to the Dragonstrike arrow. Launching this arrow will summon a dragon spirit that travels in a straight line, and will eliminate any enemies in its path.

, Hanzo has no need to reload, so you can shoot endlessly. But don't shoot blindly. Stand behind some protection, and take a peek out. Once an enemy is located, fire at them while you can. Duck behind cover when they discover you. If they start firing, wait for them to pause, then jump right back out and fire again. Try keeping your arrows aligned with where you expect them to be.

Take advantage of your Recon mode.,
Go into Sentry mode.,
Self-repair.,
Go into Tank mode.",How to Play As Bastion in Overwatch," Bastion is equipped to be fully mobile, and can fire a submachine gun attached to his right arm extension. Mow down your enemies before they can maneuver around you. Due to the recent update of the game, Bastion is now faster in this mode and has a more accurate range of fire.;
, By pressing the left bumper, Bastion will reconfigure into a solid turret. His Gatling gun is substantially more powerful, capable of eliminating enemies in mere seconds. Reconfigure back into Recon mode by pressing the left bumper again. Due to the recent update, this mode is now considered a ""tank buster"". You can also go half a second faster when transforming into this mode.

, Bastion was designed to take a lot of hits, but taking too much fire can have disastrous results. Take cover and repair your damage by pressing and holding the right bumper. You can also now use this ability while moving, which used to not be a thing.

, After dealing a certain amount of damage, you will unlock your special ability. Press ""Y/Triangle"" to temporarily go into Tank mode. In this mode, Bastion rolls around as a literal tank, launching explosive shells at enemies that can eliminate in practically one hit.

Obtain the Biggoron's Sword.",How to Get the Biggoron's Sword in the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time," Ensure that you are playing as Adult Link. Be sure that you have thawed King Zora in Zora's Domain and that you have Epona. Furthermore, it is also recommended that you familiarize yourself with the territory. Once you are ready, head to Kakariko Village.


It is also recommended that you obtain the Sun's Song. At one point, you will have to wait three days, so it can help decrease the wait time.;
, She will give you a Pocket Egg. You can either play the Sun's Song or wait one day. Once the day has passed, you will have a Pocket Cucco.

, Take the Pocket Cucco, and find the house in Kakariko Village where Talon is sleeping. Use the Pocket Cucco to wake him up. Bring the Pocket Cucco back to the Cucco Lady. Satisfied, she will give you her brother's Cucco, Cojiro, which she requests to have delivered to him.

, From the entrance, turn left. You will enter a room where you - playing as Child Link - will sell the Skull Mask to the Skull Kid. Afterwards, you will see a sad man sitting against the stump in Skull Kid's place. Give Cojiro to him, and he will give an Odd Mushroom to you with instructions to deliver it to the potion hag in Kakariko Village. She is located behind the normal potion shop. Because the mushroom spoils in three minutes, you must rush to Kakariko Village before time runs out.


Note that you cannot use Ocarina to fast travel.

, She will make you an Odd Poultice. Take it back to the Lost Woods. When you reach the place where the sad man was, you will instead discover a small Kokiri girl who says the Odd Potion is made out of forest mushrooms. She demands for you to return it to her. Once you give her the potion, she leaves you with a Poacher's Saw.

, Unless if you have defeated Gerudo's Fortress, the bridge over the chasm will be destroyed. You can cross over it by using Longshot or Epona. Afterwards, enter the carpenters' tent, and talk to the boss. After he takes the Poacher's Saw, he gives you a Broken Goron's Sword in return.

, Run past where the second set of boulders are falling. Using well-timed bombs, destroy the large rocks in your way with a couple of well-timed bombs. Jump from ledge to ledge until you reach flat ground. However, do not descend into the hole. Instead, move forward and roll past the flaming boulders. Shoot down the spiders before climbing the wall to the top. When you reach the rock clearing, run towards the wall on your upper right. A giant Goron (Biggoron) should greet you, but he is rubbing his eyes in pain. After talking to you, he says he will fix the Broken Goron's Sword in return for eyedrops. He hands you an Eyedrop Prescription.

, He informs you that while he does not have the eyedrops, he possesses the ingredients. He gives you an Eyeball Frog. Upon receiving the item, you will have three minutes to give the Eyeball Frog to the lakeside scientist. Otherwise, it will spoil.


Do not use Serenade of Water, as that will ruin the Eyeball Frog.

, Once he creates Biggoron's Eyedrops, you will have four minutes to reach the top of Death Mountain. If you travel through Darunia's room in Goron City, time stops as you pass through the crater. You can then pop out at the big Goron.


Refrain from using Bolero of Fire; otherwise, the eye drops will spoil.

, As a result, his mood greatly improves, and he promises to make you a sword in three days. He gives you a Claim Check. You can either wait three days or play the Sun's Song six times to skip time.

, After three days have passed, speak to Biggoron and receive your new weapon.

Launch grenades from a distance. You can do a lot when firing into a group that doesn't know you're there.
Launching grenades at close quarters will do quite a lot of damage to enemies, but can also hurt you.;
, Press the left bumper to throw a mine at enemies. Detonate it by pressing the left trigger. The mines will damage enemies and send them off flying.


These can be used to launch enemies off the map, if placed correctly.

, Junkrat cannot be harmed by his own mines, so you can use them as a propelling jump. Stand over a mine when you throw it and detonate it to launch yourself in the air.

, These are giant metal-toothed traps that catch enemies, preventing them from moving. Take them out before the hold on them releases.


Leave the traps around corners or in front of entrances. These will catch enemies off-guard, and leave them most open to attack.

, Whenever Junkrat dies, he drops all of the grenades in his vest. These will pulverize any enemies who stick around, so try to get close if you are taking heavy fire.

, After dealing a certain amount of damage, you will unlock your special ability. Press ""Y/Triangle"" to unleash a motorized tire bomb. Steer it where you want it to go, and detonate it with left or right trigger.

Find Lon Lon Ranch.,
Enter Lon Lon Ranch.,
Learn ""Epona's Song."",
Leave Lon Lon Ranch and go to Death Valley.,
Go back to Lon Lon Ranch after you have grown up.,
Pay to get in again, pull out your ocarina, and play Epona’s song.",How to Get Epona in Ocarina of Time1," After you have met Zelda at the palace and are escorted out by Impa, you're standing right in front of the drawbridge. Instead of heading over immediately to Death Mountain like Impa tells you, look straight ahead of where you are standing. There should be what looks like a group of houses on top of a hill. This is Lon Lon Ranch.;
, This is where Talon (the man you woke up at the palace to access the path) and his daughter live. Run straight in between the two buildings when you first enter and you will find yourself in a place that looks like a ranch, with a sort of circular racetrack.

, Enter the pen where the horses are running around and you will see a small girl standing in the middle, singing. Talk to her. She will thank you for waking up her father, and go on about the song she is singing. Take out your ocarina and learn “Epona’s Song.”

, Play out the next two dungeons as planned. After the dungeons are complete, go to the Temple of Time to become grown up.

, You will see that it is no longer the happy wonderful place it was when you were a kid. Now the farm has been taken over by Ingo, who has pledged allegiance to Ganondorf. You’ll see that the ranch is now used for a horse riding game. Pay Ingo the money to get in, and choose any horse and ride around. You cannot do this on the first go, so don’t try. After the time runs out, he will kick you out.

, Epona will run over to you. Get on her and ride over to the entrance where Ingo is standing. While on the horse ‘Z’ target him and press the ‘A’ button to talk. He will challenge you to a race, betting you 50 rupees. Accept the terms of the wager.


Practice riding Epona first. Move the joystick in the direction that you want to go; riding her is really as simple as that.






Press the ‘A’ button to feed Epona a carrot for a burst of speed. Epona will go faster, but you'll lose a carrot. Only use these from time to time.







"
"
Steer Epona onto the inside track of the loop.,
After winning the race, know that Ingo will freak out and challenge you once again.,
Using the same tips as before, race him again.,
Once you finally do end up beating Ingo, know that he will be insanely angry.,
Find a way to jump out of the fence.,
Land on the other side of the wall and enjoy the freedom and speed of Epona.",How to Get Epona in Ocarina of Time2," Ingo will try to keep you from getting inside position, but he won't be completely successful at it. When he gives up inside position, press 'A' for a burst of speed and speed past him on the inside track.

, He’ll turn red and scream about Ganondorf. Then, rather unfairly, he'll challenge you to a second race. If you win, you will get Epona.

, Ingo’s going to end up being a lot faster than last time, but there isn’t much you can do about it. Just give it your best and keep trying.


Once you get inside position, don't give it up. It'll take Ingo a lot of effort to pass you on the outside, so just remember to hold position and you should be fine.






Don't over-feed Epona with carrots right away. Although some people can beat Ingo without using very many carrots at all, it's best to use just a few. Don't use too many in the beginning or you won't have any left when you really need them — at the end of the race.







, He says that you can keep the horse, but you can’t leave the ranch. He shuts the gate and laughs like an idiot. Seems like all is lost, right? Wrong!

, Know that Ingo's locked the gate to the inside of the Lon Lon corral, you have two choices.


The hard way: Run straight at Ingo and jump the gate. It will have to be perfect though or else all you will end up doing is running into him.






The easy way: On the left side of the ranch there is a wall. Heading from the entrance towards the wall, run at an angle. It doesn’t have to be perfect, Epona can jump over it either way.







, Now you can enjoy all of the benefits that comes with having a horse. Mostly that includes being able to cross the world in about thirty seconds, rather than the three minutes it would take without her.


Epona isn’t an essential part of the game. You really don’t “need” her for anything, but she is really a big help, so try to get her if you can.

, The real one is lighter than the fake one, and a purple vortex will appear as it comes out. Hit this one with an arrow. You can also use the Hookshot, but this is slower than using arrows. Should you not hit him fast enough, go to one of the Triforce images at each corner of the platform to avoid his electric ball attack, which he hits the center of the arena with.

, Use your sword to hit the energy ball back. He'll hit it back; repeat this process until he's hit with his energy ball. You can also use an empty bottle to hit the energy ball back.

, When you've damaged him a few times, he'll sometimes do another attack where he charges at you. Avoid this attack, as it does three hearts of damage. You'll know when he's going to do the attack when he twirls his staff around a few times and lets off small magic sparks with it.

, Once you see flames flaring out from a random hole, run by it and wait for the creature to come. When Volvagia pops out, hit her with the Megaton Hammer (Z-Targeting makes it easy) and then with the sword.

, Since she is enormous and curls into a C shape, it can be difficult to avoid her. This is the part of the battle where it's possible to hit her with arrows. If you don't want to, hang off the side of the island and wait until she disappears into a hole.

, This time, Volvagia will fly straight up to the ceiling. Rocks will begin to fall, but avoid panicking as this will increase your chances of getting hit. Instead, run around and dodge the rocks. You can stay on the island and use your shield, rolling whenever a huge shadow looms over you. Another option is to hang onto the ledge of the island again, which shields you from damage.

, Eventually, Volvagia will die. The scene may be gruesome, so it's best to look away if you dislike violence. Finished.

Notice the change in the form.,
Charge up your shield.,
Beat Twinrova.",How to Beat Twinrova in Zelda: Ocarina of Time," The Twinrova sisters circle around you slowly. Every once in a while, one stops to shoot either fire or ice at you, depending on the sister. Each of these attacks take a lot of damage, and together the Twinrova sisters make a formidable foe!;
, The trick to completing the first phase of the battle is to block an attack with the Mirror Shield back at the opposite sister (so if the fire sister shot fire at you, you would have to use use the Mirror Shield to hit the ice sister).


A good trick is to stand on the opposite side of the room of the attacking sister. Quickly target the other sister and block the attack with the Mirror Shield.

, Soon, the Twinrova sisters will combine into one form.

, The goal of this battle is to charge up your shield. When Twinrova shoots at you, block. Choose which element you want to charge your shield with, and if Twinrova shoots the opposite element, jump out of the way.

, Twinrova, once hit, will go down on one of the islands. Thankfully, if you have the Biggoron's Sword, you'll only have to make her go down twice (meaning you only have to hit her four times!). Soon she'll be defeated, and you can collect the Heart Container and step through the portal.

the A button to do primary actions
the B button to swing the sword
the C-pad for the items
the Start/Pause button for menus
the L button for targeting; and the R button for secondary targeting;
, This will help you in the long run for saving the game, looking at the map, using your items, knowing the objectives, and other important stuff. Though dumb, it can save you in the future (pun intended).

, In order to master any Zelda game, one must utilize the items properly as items are one of the franchise's most important mechanics. Practice using them for different purposes and know how the controls for each.

, The Great Deku Tree and Navi will order you to get a sword and shield hidden in the forest, meet with the Great Deku Tree, complete the first dungeon, kill Gohma (the first boss), and collect the Kokiri Emerald.

, You must do this by collecting three sacred gems (you already have one) and the Ocarina of Time to enter the Temple of Time to obtain the Master Sword to kill Ganondorf. To do that, you must meet with Zelda, go to the gems' respective locations, find access to the dungeon, and beat the dungeon and boss to get them.

, Looks like Ganondorf rebelled against the King, followed Link to the Temple of Time, and got the Triforce to rule Hyrule for 7 long years. Go to 6 different dungeons to meet new people, unlock new areas, beat bosses, get Sage Medallions, and find the 6 Sages.

, With all medallions and sages united, go to his evil base and let the sages do their magic to let you enter. Conquer the base and fight with Ganondorf with all you got!

, The eye usually protects an item or pathway by blocking off a door with a barrier, whether it's metal bars, wall, or Camouflage . Use a shooting item like the Sling-Shot and Hero's Bow to shoot the eye down.

, The switch is on the floor and must be stepped on to activate a mechanism or unlock a door. But here is the catch: as soon as you step off, it reactivates itself. Find and push a heavy box or crate to the switch so that it stays on.

, The torches must be lit in order for an item to be accessed or a door to be unlocked. Use a Deku Stick and light it up with fire and go to the torches to light them up.

, The puzzle is actually not a puzzle at all; it is just a group of powerful enemies appearing in a locked room to fight you. In order to get back out, continue on, or get an item, you must fight and defeat all the enemies to do so.

, The blockage can be blocking a door, path, item, and so on. Use strong items to destroy the barrier such as bombs, gauntlets, and hammers.

, The Ocarina of Time is the only item that can solve these puzzles; they usually have musical notes or the Ocarina carved into the object. Play a certain song in order to solve the Puzzle (i.e., move, teleport, or change the object).

, Use your sword and slash away at the enemy until they die. Dodge, roll, side-step, and defend to prevent yourself from getting hurt.

, Some enemies can only die if they are hurt by certain items (or die much faster). Find out what item they are weakest to and then kill them with it.

, Sometimes you may have to do a combination of sword fighting and using special items to defeat enemies. Almost all bosses are also defeated this way as well.

, This gives you a better choice when fighting or solving puzzles, or even for bragging rights. Some collectibles can also be used for other uses, such as health and magic.

, Playing them allows you to relax, mess around a bit, and win cool prizes. Some items can only be collected by trying to win these mini-games.

, You are to go back and forth to different places and different people, giving them and receiving items. But at the end it is all worth it!

, These items usually are hidden throughout Hyrule and you must do certain things before earning that item."

, To warp to Lake Hylia, play the Serenade of Water (you learn this from Sheik the first time you enter Lake Hylia). You will see a mostly dried-up lake and a small pool of water. You'll need to sink into that pool using the Iron Boots to enter the temple.

, Put on your Zora Tunic and your Iron Boots, then sink down to the bottom of the pool. When you look up, you will see a blue crystal. Hit it with the Hookshot to lift the temple gate. Take off the Boots, and you will be able to swim into the temple.

, Put the Iron Boots back on. Look for the opening with a torch on either side. Go through it and follow the path to find Princess Ruto.

, After you reunite with Princess Ruto, she will ask you to follow her upwards. She will show you that you can change the water level in the temple. Take the Boots back off and follow her.

, When you reach the surface, you'll notice that Princess Ruto is gone. Get out of the water and head to the Triforce symbol on the wall. Play Zelda's Lullaby to drain all the water away.


Note that you'll need to return and repeat this process at various points to beat the Water Temple. Every time you want to drain the water, simply come back here and play Zelda's Lullaby at the Triforce symbol again.

, Go through the door and kill all the spiked enemies. A treasure chest will appear, and you will receive the Dungeon Map. Exit the room and jump down to the ground.

, Go into the central pillar (the first time you do this, you'll need a key). Latch onto the upper ledge with your Hookshot. Play Zelda's Lullaby at the Triforce symbol, and the temple will fill halfway.


Note that, as with the process to drain the water completely, this procedure to fill the temple halfway will need to be repeated in order to beat the Water Temple. Each time you need to do this, come back and play Zelda's Lullaby at the Triforce symbol in the central pillar.

, Look for the door with two pots at its entrance. Follow the path until you see spikes, then latch onto the target on the wall to get onto the ledge. Use any target on the roof to get to the top of the room. You will now be able to see a crystal and a chest in a geyser. Shoot the crystal with an arrow to collect the Compass.

, You probably already know that Small Keys are absolutely crucial for navigating temples. There are six of them in the Water Temple. To get the first one, drain the water away, then jump down to the ground. Light the two torches, either by shooting arrows through them or by using Din's Fire, and a door will open in front of you. Go through it and kill the Shell Blade enemies inside, and a chest containing a Small Key will appear.

, This one is a bit more difficult to find and involves taking your Boots on and off to sink and surface repeatedly. Start by draining the water away and finding the opening with a giant brown block obstructing it. Push the block until it sinks underwater, then put on your Iron Boots to sink. Next:


Dive down and go to the end of the hallway.
Take your Boots off and float up to the surface.
Hit the nearby crystal to activate a geyser. Use that geyser as a step to cross the gap, and head to the next room, which will have a whirlpool.
Put your Boots on and sink underwater again. You will see a statue. Hit the crystal in the statue's mouth with your Hookshot and kill all the Shell Blade enemies.
Take your Boots off. Float upwards, and you will see a chest. Open it, and you will find -- finally! -- the second Small Key.

, Fill the temple halfway with water. Then return to the place where you first saw Princess Ruto and float upwards. When you reach a wall with a crack, detonate it with a Bomb. Collect the Small Key inside.

, Fill the temple halfway with water. You will see that the platform in the pillar rises too. Sink into the hole underneath, follow the path, and when you see a crystal, hit it. Kill the enemies that appear, and a gate will open on the roof. Float upwards to get your fourth Small Key.

, This Small Key is also more complicated to find. You can only do it after you have found the Longshot and moved the block with the Song of Time to access a cavern. Once you have done that:


Swim the cavern's path, taking care to avoid being caught in the vortexes. At the end of the path, you will see a small ledge with an eye in front of it. Shoot it to open the adjacent cage.
Using the Longshot, latch yourself quickly to the chest inside. The gate will close within a few seconds, so you'll have to hurry. Inside the chest, you will find the fifth Small Key. Collect it and follow the short path back to the room with the dragon statue. Follow your map to return to the main room.

, Fill the temple halfway and look for the closed opening with an eye. Shoot the eye to lift the gate and expose a target, then latch onto the target to reach the opening before the gate closes. Follow the path until you come to a giant block. Push the block out of the way, head right, and you'll see a chest with your sixth Small Key. Now you have them all! To return to the main room, go to the other end of the pathway and latch onto the target above you.

, To fill the temple completely, the water must be at the halfway mark, and you must be on the second floor. Go through the door with the target. Inside, set a bomb and stand on the geyser (but watch out for the Tektite!). When the geyser raises you to the next room, go through the door and play Zelda's Lullaby at the Triforce symbol.


As with draining the Water Temple and filling it halfway, filling the temple completely is a procedure you will need to repeat. Each time you need to fill the temple, repeat this step.

, Return to the main room. Go through the door with the brown platform, and you will find yourself in a room with a massive gap. Jump onto the lowest moving platform and then use the Hookshot to climb the stairs.

, You will see a room with statues and small pillars.

, You will see a red crystal on one of the pillars. Hit it with the Hookshot or an arrow to turn it blue. The statues in the room will begin to rise, and Hookshot targets will be revealed.

, To do this, first latch onto the target in front of you. Then switch the crystal off again and latch onto the nearby target. Climb over the statue's head, switch the crystal back on, and latch onto the last statue. Shoot the crystal again, and once the statue has lowered, climb on its head and shoot the crystal one last time. You will now be able to reach the ledge behind it.


Beware of the Like Like in front of the door! If it catches you, you will lose your Zora Tunic and your Hylian Shield. To get them back, destroy the Like Like.

, Dark Link is Link's evil doppelgänger. To find him, go to the locked door on the other side of the room. When you reach it, turn around. You will see a shadowy figure by an island -- that's Dark Link!

, Attack the shadowy figure to start the mini-boss battle with Dark Link. Striking him directly will not be effective; he has all of your standard attacks. Instead, attack him with items that he cannot copy, like Din's Fire or the Megaton Hammer. Repeat as many times as necessary to defeat him, watching his movements carefully -- when you strike him, he will appear behind you.

, When you defeat Dark Link, the room will change in appearance, and the doors will unlock. Head into the next room and open the chest to collect the Longshot, an upgraded version of the Hookshot that can shoot twice as far.

, To do that, drain the water completely. Look for the opening that leads underwater (it's in the northern part of the temple). Dive under, follow the path, then turn around and latch onto the target above you. Latch onto the target above the door, then use a Small Key to open it. You will find yourself in a room full of Tektites (the spider-like enemies).

, From the Tektite room, make your way underwater using the Iron Boots. Swim to the next room.

, Once in the next room, you will see a pool of water and a long platform to your left. Jump onto the platform and kill the Stingers. Look at the wall by the entrance. Part of it will have a lighter color than the rest. Use a bomb to detonate that part of the wall, and a secret passage will appear.

, After you find the secret passage, you will see another weak wall. Detonate it with a bomb, and a brown block will appear. Navigate around the block and push it until it falls on top of a switch. A new door on the left side of the room will become available.

, Climb the stairs, go through the new door, and press the switch to activate three geysers in the gap beside you.

, Cross the gap as quickly as possible, avoiding the Tektites. You will be able to enter the next room, where you will see a small waterfall.

, Boulders will roll down from the right of the waterfall. Avoid them and head into the gap, following the underwater path until you find a dead end.

, When you hit the dead end, kill the Shell Blade and then float upwards. Inside the door in front of you will be the Boss Key.

, Once you have the Boss Key, return to the main room. Fill the temple completely with water, then move around until you notice a statue with a Hookshot target on it. Use your Longshot to latch onto it and access the door behind it. You will find yourself in a room with a steep slope and a Boss door at the end. Walk up the slope, avoiding the blades that slide across the room. Inside the Boss door is Morpha, the Boss of the Water Temple.

, Morpha is the evil monster hoarding all of Lake Hylia's water. It can manipulate all water it touches, making it a frightening opponent. To emerge victorious, use the following tips:


Pull Morpha's nucleus close to you with the Longshot, then hit it with your sword.
Stay off the islands and use the perimeter of the room. Morpha's reach is limited, and you can use that to your advantage.
Don't try to handle Morpha underwater! You won't be able to use your sword underwater, so stick to the surface.

, Once you have destroyed Morpha, grab your Heart Container and exit through the portal. Congratulations! You have finally beaten the difficult and annoying Water Temple!

, When you enter the Sacred Realm, you will learn that the Water Sage is Princess Ruto herself. She will award you the Water Medallion and assure you that Princess Zelda is safe.

Unlike in the 2-D version of the Legend of Zelda games, Keeses in the 3-D versions of the game (Majora’s Mask, Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, Skyward Swords, to name a few) can fly 360 degrees around and will come straight at you instead of just in random directions.

, Just like in 2-D versions, these bats can be taken down using any weapons you have. Equip your sword or whatever weapon of your choice on the Action button of your controller.

, Once the bats start to come at you, press the “Aim” button on your controller to focus the camera view right on the Keeses. Keep pressing down the button to lock your aim.


If you don’t know which button you should press, an on-screen prompt will show on the game screen, notifying you which button on your controller serves as the “Aim.”

, While holding down the Aim button, press the corresponding Action button of the weapon you want to use to kill the Keeses. These bats can be destroyed with just a single blow of your sword.

This Poe must be found in order to beat the dungeon.
This Poe must be found in order to beat the dungeon.
This Poe must be found in order to beat the dungeon.

,
This undead fiend is on the 33rd floor of the ordeal filled cavern.
This Poe can be spotted floating about on the 44th level of the cave.

, Floating above those walls are Peahats. Clawshot your way from one to the next, but pausing on the third one. If you look to the south, you'll see a broken pillar with a tree growing out of it. Clawshot to the conveniently hovering Peahat, then drop down and defeat the Poe.
This is located in the central area of the fourth floor, outside of the pillar room with the Big Key. You'll find yourself in a courtyard filled with Kargarocs and Lizalfos Knights, as well as a myriad of ropes that you must cross in your wolf form. Make your way around the tower via the ropes to a large platform. You should be able to recognize this platform by looking for the chest and the Poe on top of it.

, Talk to the second Goron you come across to have him vault you onto the cliffs you see to the side of the main path. The Poe is hovering around this ledge.

,, This Poe will be flitting about near a large rock formation.
This one can be found in the far corner near the Warp Point.
Near the small enemy camp south of the Arbiter's Grounds (the really small one, with the campfire and boars), there's a rock formation with a tree atop it. Well, not really ""near"" so just hit the camp and then head west/east (Wii/Cube). Use the Clawshot to get to the tree, then follow the raised path to reach this Poe.
See directions to the above Poe, then look for a circle of rocks and a large dig spot. There will be two Poe's in that grotto.
See above.
When you first enter the canyon leading to the Arbiter's Grounds, take one of the side branches to find this Poe (Right on the Wii and Left on the Cube).
After defeating King Bulblin in the fort, return to the spot of the epic battle to find this Poe.
This one is just to the side of the Arbiter's Grounds doorway.

, Follow the balcony into the main street, then Clawshot to the netting. Now just follow this back to where you saw the Poe.

, South of the path leading to Lake Hylia is a path that leads you to an old arena. This Poe waits at the bottom of the stadium seating.
Enter Kakariko Gorge from Southern Hyrule Field, then head up the nearby hill and seek ye the Poe that floats near the tree.
If you enter the Kakariko Gorge area from Southern Hyrule Field, you'll spot a wall with a suspicious boulder in front of it. Bomb it and enter, then traverse it to find this Poe in one of the deepest branches.
In Southern Hyrule Field, you'll find the Poe floating above a hill which lies to the north of the bridge.
In Northern Hyrule Field is a large bridge spanning the river. The center of the bridge contains a Poe.
In Northern Hyrule Field, cross the bridge and head toward the paths leading towards Castle Town. There's a circle of grass near one of the trees, and there's a dig spot there leading to a hidden grotto. Inside said grotto there are two Poe's you can defeat.
See above.
You can find this Poe on the overly large staircase just south of Castle Town.
Enter Castle Town, then take the western/eastern (Wii/Cube) exit to find this Poe floating over a bridge.
South of the Great Bridge of Hylia is a not as great wooden bridge. Go south of that wooden bridge and gaze up at the cliff. You'll spot some boulders, which you should use bomb arrows to blow up. Use the newly exposed Clawshot points to traverse the ledges until you reach a platform with this Poe.

, Head to the tower you blew up while collecting Tears of Light earlier to find this Poe.
From the previous Poe, follow the path up to the lookout tower's entrance to spot this one.
You'll find this one floating around in the middle of the graveyard.
Move one of the tombstones near the entrance of the graveyard to reveal this Poe.

,
From the Warp Point, take the southern bridge to the next ledge and climb the ladder. Follow this path to the tower and then dispatch the Poe.
Head south of the Warp Point and cross the bridge, then climb the ladder. Along the wall at the top you should be able to spot a suspicious looking patch of wall. Bomb it and traverse the cave to find three Poe's.
See above.
See above.
Near the waterfall at the edge of the lake is a patch of land. Swim out there and make landfall to find this Poe.
Play Falbi's Flight by Fowl game and head toward the Isle of Riches, aiming for the third platform from the bottom. The Poe can be found hovering between there and the second platform.
Talk to Falbi and agree to play the Flight by Fowl game. As soon as you leap off the platform, hold down on the controls and turn around. Now visible will be a platform underneath the cliff, which you should aim for. Once you alight on the small platform, dispatch this Poe.

, Do so, then climb the ledges to find this Poe.
In the area with the final confrontations with the Skull Kid, there's a boulder that you can bomb. Doing so will reveal a Poe.
This one can be found floating around in the area where the Master Sword had been sleeping.
This one is just outside the entrance to the Temple of Time, in the area that is in the past. Flanking the stairway to the present are two owl statues. Behind one of them is this Poe.

, Head to the base of the mountain and cross the ice floes, then begin the ascent. This Poe is near some rocks pretty close to the base.
On your way up the mountain you'll come across a clearing of sorts with two trees in it. One of the trees has a Poe floating near its branches.
During the mountain climb, you'll find some ledges that need be climbed. After climbing them, there's a path off to one side that leads to a lone tree. Head to the tree and defeat the Poe.
Just inside the mountain cave are two large things of ice. Break them with the Ball 'n Chain to reveal this Poe.
From the entrance to Snowpeak Ruins, turn into a wolf and then head back toward the trail. Just outside of the gateway is a tall rock formation. After wending your way to the top you shall see this Poe.

,
In the entryway are twin lines of suits of armor. Smash them with your Ball and Chain to reveal this Poe.
After you receive the Ball and Chain and pass through the foyer via chandelier, enter the next doorway. This room is full of ice and Freezards. Along one of the walls is a set of ice pillars that you can smash, and doing so reveals this Poe.

, Follow the staircase onto the first balance, then toss statues as needed to reach the second balance. Toss another one onto the lower balance to raise the second more, so that when you're on top of it it won't lower. Climb onto the small pillar there, then Clawshot to the ceiling above the central gazebo. Follow the path, then use the Spinner to reach a ledge. This Poe will be floating around near the door leading to the Big Key.
On the third floor is a large circular room, one with a platform that will raise or lower levels. Along the edge of the room is a Poe behind a gate. Use the Dominion Rod to move a statue onto the switch behind the gate (or just smash the gate with the giant statue, depending on when you're doing this) to reach the Poe.

, How mean of it to force you to swim there.

, Follow the path up the small hill to find this Poe.

, You found all 60 Poes!

Look at the goron.,
Watch his movements.,
And you'll see when he is about to grab you.,
He goes left you go right.,
Once you get him twice he gets slow, Then that means you go in for the final grab.",How to Get Passed the First Goron in Zelda Twilight Princess," See where or when he's going to grab you or try to punch you.;
, Like you'll see when he punches left or right. You'll see when he is about to attack.

, Since he's so big, you will only see it for a brief second. So once you see it you got to do the opposite.

, He goes right you go left. This is when you don't do the opposite. He goes for a grab you also go for a grab.

, Once you do that then he goes down like a ton of bricks.

Find a Big Octo.,
Look for a flock of seagulls.,
Stay away from the whirlpool.,
Destroy the eyes of the Big Octo.,
Get the heart.",How to Get a Heart from Giant Octo in the Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker," There are five Big Octos available in the game, each found on separate locations, namely:


Two Eyed Reef – South of the map
Diamond Steppe Island – Southwest corner of the map
Fire Mountain – Northeast of the map, two spaces below the Seven Star Isles
Seven Star Isles – Northeast of the map
Tingle Island – Northwest, near the center of the map;
, Once you’re at the part of the sea near the areas mentioned above, ride your boat around the waters and look for a flock of seagulls along the horizon. Once you find one, sail towards the spot where the birds are flying, and you should see a Big Octo.

, Once you get close to a Big Octo, it will try to suck you in using a whirlpool in the water. Using the directional keys or the analog stick on your game controller, move your boat around the monster, backing away when you’re getting a little too close to avoid getting sucked in.


If you do get sucked into the whirlpool, the monster will spit you out and throw you on the far side of the map.

, To defeat the giant creature, you need to destroy all of its eyes (Big Octos have 5 to 8 eyes).Take out your boomerang or your bow and arrow, and press the “Aim” button to focus your sight at the monster’s eyes. Press the “Action” button to fire your projectile weapon at the eye of the monster.


Keep doing this until you’ve destroyed all of the monster’s eyes and kill it.

, Once the Big Octo is destroyed, move your boat to where the center of the whirlpool used to be, and use the Salvage Crane of your boat to retrieve the sunken treasure. Once retrieved, the chest will open and you’ll be able to get the heart.

Tackle the hard part.,
Go through.,
Get to the chest and get the Small Key.

,
Go to the Big Gate with the skulls on it.,
Fight King Bulbin.,
Charge on.,
Walk up the stairs and into Arbiter's Grounds.

",How to Get Into Arbiter's Grounds in Zelda Twilight Princess," Once you have been shot out of the cannon, you will land in the Gerudo Desert. After a cut-scene with Midna, head southeast (avoid pits and crevices in the desert). You will also be attacked by Gerudo Moldorms which burrow around you and jump at you. You can pull them out with your Clawshot. It takes about two or three hits to kill them.;
, A large pillar (actually a piece of bridge) is sticking out of the top.

, You can't jump up onto the ledge so use your clawshot and attach to the Peahat (flying plant) and wait for it to fly over to the next ledge. Shadow Beasts will appear so kill them all. Get to the piece of bridge. Tell Midna to warp the piece of bridge to the Bridge of Eldin (if you have defeated the Shadow Beasts and opened a portal there yet) and then warp back to the desert.

, The Temple, or as we know it, Arbiter's Grounds, is in sight. Head over to it while killing the Moldorms and avoiding the pits. When you get the the gate, there will be a small little camp of Bulbins.

, To charge just hit the 'A' button and it will rage around. Go through the wooden gate.

, In this part (pray it is nighttime, which it should be), you have to snipe all the Bulblins before they see you and sound an alarm which will call an endless supply of Bulbins. Do not attempt to charge one: snipe them all! It helps if you have the Hawkeye, but you don't need it.

, When you arrive at a camp with a tent and a pig on a split over a fire, snipe all the Bulbins.

,, It should be just around the corner of the camp where you got the key. Open it. Walk inside.

, Oh No! King Bulblin has returned and now he will battle you on foot. When he strikes with his axe go behind him and hit him in the back a few times. (back-slice works well too) .

, After you beat him he will limp away and the place will set on fire. Get on the Bullbo and hit 'A'. Charge through the gate you came in. You will charge through all the walls and eventually you will arrive at the Main Entrance.

Beat Gohma.,
Beat Kalle Demos.,
Beat Gohdan.,
Beat Helmaroc King.,
Beat Jalhalla.,
Beat Molgera.,
Beat Puppet Ganon.,
Beat Ganondorf.",How to Defeat the Bosses in Wind Waker," This battle will take place inside the Dragon Roost Cavern. Beating Gohma requires you to destroy its shell first. To do so, use your grappling hook to make a chunk of rock fall directly on Gohma. Do this threes time and its shell will eventually break. After that, get near Gohma’s eye (by using your grappling hook) and attack it repeatedly with your sword. This process will defeat Gohma in no time.;
, Kalle Demos is the Forbidden Woods plant boss. The strategy to beat this boss is to make it fall when it attaches itself to the ceiling. You can do so by using your boomerang. Target its tentacles while you are running around the battle area and it should fall down sooner or later. Once it falls down, attack it with your sword, and better yet spin attacks, until it is defeated.

, You will face Gohdan in the Tower of Gods. The routine in defeating Gohdan is quite similar in how Bongo-Bongo of Ocarina of Time is defeated. Simply use your arrows to shoot its hands to trigger a stun. After stunning the boss, shoot its eyes to make its mouth open. Once its mouth is wide open – throw in a bomb inside to inflict damage. Repeat this process to beat Gohdan.

, Beating the Helmaroc King requires dodging a lot. When you face this boss in the Forsaken Fortress, initially, you just have to dodge its beak attacks until it gets its beak stuck to the ground. Now, use your skull hammer to smash its beak. Do this five times and its armor will be destroyed. When its armor is gone, it will again attack. Just the same, dodge its attacks until its beak gets stuck again to the ground. Without its armor, you can now hit the Helmaroc King with your sword until it gets defeated.

, Jalhalla is the boss of the Wind Temple. Jalhalla is an accumulation of little poes to create a big poe! In order to beat Jalhalla, you need to split it to small poes first. To do so, use your mirror shield to stun the boss with light beams. Once stunned, carry Jalhalla and throw him to the spikes in the corner. This will break Jalhalla to smaller poes. Now is your chance to destroy these little poes before they combine again. Repeat the process to eventually defeat Jalhalla.

, Another boss found in Wind Temple is Molgera. Molgera has some vicious attacks so you better keep your distance when battling with it. Your target here is its blue tongue. When it appears, quickly shoot it with your hookshot to pull Molgera towards you and attack with your sword. Eventually, it will start flying around and will dig under the sand. Still, watch out for that blue tongue and immediately us your hookshot on it. This process will beat Molgera after several repetitions.

, Ganon is a mini boss in Ganon’s Tower. Although Ganon is a mini boss, it has three forms you must defeat – the puppet, spider, and Moldorm form. Each form has its unique weaknesses but the common denominator of each battle is for you to use your light arrows to shoot the blue orb.


Puppet form: Simply use your boomerang to break the puppet’s strings that holds its tail. Now shoot the blue orb on its tail. Do this two more times and you will successfully beat the puppet form
Spider form: This form should be an easy form to beat. The spider form will go up the air and will try to smash on you landing on its back. Rotate the camera accordingly so you can spot its blue orb. Once spotted, attack it with your light arrows. Do this twice and you should beat this form.
Moldorm form: Among the three, this form seems to be the most challenging - challenging in the sense that the blue orb will not be an easy target this time. You can just land a decent shot at its blue orb when it is stunned. You can stun this form by striking its head while it slithers around the room. You can also go try shooting its blue orb without stunning but it will be very difficult. Three shots on its blue orb will beat this form.

, The final battle will be between you and Ganondorf. This battle is divided into two parts. First part is when Zelda assists you in fighting Ganondorf. She will shoot light arrows at him and it is your part to strike him with your master sword. After doing this repeatedly Ganondorf will eventually knock off Zelda. At this point, just try to avoid his attacks and parry its jump attack by pressing A. When Zelda recovers, this commences the second part of the battle. Continue fighting Ganondorf until Zelda instructs you to use your shield. Target Ganondorf with your shield while Zelda shoots it with a light arrow. Now approach Ganondorf and parry once more to finally beat the final boss!

She will ask for your help and eventually instruct you to toss her on an opposite ledge. After doing so, she will reward you with the bottle. This bottle is required to finish the game.;
, You will be able to travel to this island once you are able to sail. Once you land, look for a man named Ho Ho and investigate what he is looking at in his telescope. It’s a submarine! Sail your way to the submarine and fight your way to obtain the bottle.

, The third bottle comes with a cost! For 500 rupees, you will be able to buy the third bottle inside Beedle’s ship. Of course, this requires your ability to sail to reach this ship.

, This can only be done during nighttime. First, you need to find a girl named Mila but she will run away from you. Chase her but be careful not to be too close or she will spot you! Once she arrives at Zunari’s safe is when you can talk to her. You will be asked a series of questions. Always select the first option and she will give you the last bottle.

Find Cyclos.,
Let your boat get sucked into the whirlpool.,
Equip your Bow and Arrow.,
Shoot Cyclos.,
Use the song.",How to Get the Ballad of Gales Song in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker," Cyclos is one of the two wind gods, and in order to learn ""Ballad of Gales"" you need to find him (since he'll be the one to teach it to you.) He'll be inside of a large tornado, so that's what you'll be looking for. Sail around until you see it, and keep in mind it will always be in one of the following three locations.


Mother and Child Isles (This is location B-2 on the World Map)
Northern Triangle Island (This is location D-3 on the World Map)
Shark Island (This is location C-6 on the World Map);
, At the base of the tornado, you should see a whirlpool. Sail closer to it, and then allow your boat to get sucked in.

, You should have obtained the Hero's Bow by this point in the game (it was the treasure back in Tower of the Gods). Equip is as soon as you have entered the whirlpool so that you can begin shooting at Cyclos.

, You'll need to hit him three times in order for him to teach you ""Ballad of Gales"" and it won't be easy. Due to the poor visibility offered once you're inside the whirlpool, aiming is almost impossible, but here are a few things to keep in mind.


Aim high. Even when you can't see Cyclos, your best bet is going to be to aim toward the top of tornado. If you see Cyclos, aim for him, but if you can't see him it's best just to aim high since that's where he'll be.
Shoot quickly. Firing arrows rapidly without aiming is one of the most common ways that people hit Cyclos. Aim if you can, but don't waste too much time aiming for something you can't see. Remember, the more arrows you shoot the more chances you have of hitting him.

, When you have successfully hit him three times, he will descend from the tornado on a cloud and teach the ""Ballad of Gales"" to you. You will then be able to use it to warp to various points on the map as you so choose.

Always have a bottle ready before a boss battle as there is always a fairy to catch in one of the pots in the room before the boss.

",How to Beat The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker," It is important to talk to everyone when you arrive on an island. Some characters say different things, so talk to everyone twice and that will ensure you know a lot about the island, a lot about what you're doing on that island and even some secrets that might be on the island.;
, Whenever you get to a new island, make sure you have bait and get one of the fish jumping out of the ocean to plot the island on your chart. Your sea chart is extremely useful and the sooner you can get this out of the way, the better. You can also defeat the wind god that lives in the big cyclones once you get the bow and arrow. This means you can warp to any island and get them charted quicker.

, When facing foes, equip the Grappling Hook which you will get in the Dragon Roost Island dungeon. L target the enemy and tap the Grappling Hook item; it will swing at the enemy and you are guaranteed to get a spoil from them (depending on the type of enemy). This is good for when you are low on hearts, or you need to collect an item like joy pendants or golden feathers.

, Get a fairy in a bottle and go visit Grandma. Stand as close as you can get to her and use the fairy. It will go up you, and down onto Grandma. Grandma is now happy and full of life again, and she will offer you soup which can double your attack power for the first ten moves before you're hit. It will also replenish full magic and full hearts. She gives you two portions in each bottle and will only give you one bottle at a time. Make sure to get a bottle before facing the final boss.

, Make sure you check your magic meter before you fly every time. Magic is also used up from the fire and ice arrows and the special spin attack. When trying to land, look at the ground which you want to land on and wait for your shadow to appear, then it's safe.

, Make sure you read closely to what the sea chart fish have to say. Write it down; some information they give is vital to the game.

, Typically, there will be more rupees in flowers than grass. Go to the Savage Labyrinth on Outset Island, which is only available after you get the Power Bracelet. At the end of the challenges, there are a lot of rupees and if you use the Grappling Hook on all of the enemies, then you will get tones of spoils. Treasure hunting in the ocean is a good way to get rupees. Some will only show up at night.

Either use your shield or jump out of the way. Repeat a few more times.;
, To avoid this attack, perform a back slice to roll out of it. Jumping sideways won't do anything.

Now you can target him as he charges at you. Midna's hair/hand thingy will go up and you'll be able to grab him but don't press the button too early or too late or you'll be tossed aside. Once you've gotten a hold of him, toss him left or right (these actions are exactly like catching an Ordon goat). Then transform into a human and hit his stomach again. Repeat.

, Most of them will be red. After he's disappeared into one of them, numerous red portals will appear all over the room. You need to keep a sharp eye out for a blue one to appear. This portal will be the one he will come charging at you through. When he does come out of it, have your bow and arrows equipped and quickly shoot an arrow at the glowing piece on his forehead.

, After he's hit with that arrow, he'll crash on the ground and you may possibly be hit by his body sliding at you. Jump out of the way after you shoot him and go over to his belly. There's a white, glow-y scar. This is his weak spot and the only way to defeat this stage. Hit it as many times with your sword. Afterwards, he'll get up and run through another portal. Repeat this process.

, After awhile, he'll start to change his strategy and jump high into the air to avoid your arrows. Now you need to transform into Wolf-Link and wait for him to come out of the red portal. When he's charging at you, ""L"" target him and use ""A"" to grab his head with Midna. Then while using the joystick (depends on if you have the Wii version or GameCube version), toss him left or right onto the ground. As Wolf-Link, go to his belly and attack it. After you've done this a few times, he should be defeated.

, Everything gets confusing after Ocarina of Time, when Link can time-travel. It results in a split timeline with three separate possible outcomes. Each possible outcome leads to a Zelda game., It tells you about the entire history of the Zelda games., Get. Confused. Write all the things down, if you won't remember. It can be difficult to remember things in the timeline. Reading too many avid fans' theories about the timelines might make it worse., For example, Skyward Sword, The Minish Cap, Four Swords and so on."

Find water to swim in.,
Dive into the water.,
Swim on the surface.,
Dive underwater.,
Look closely while swimming or diving.,
Lock onto a target.,
Perform a spin attack.,
Swim back to land.",How to Swim in Skyward Sword," There are many areas in the game map where you can find bodies of water that you can swim in. Several pools can be found inside various dungeons, and small ponds are placed inside cities. The largest body of water you can swim into would be Lake Florida, situated in the southeast corner of the game map.;
, To get into the water, simply walk towards the edge using the analog stick on the left Wii Remote, and Link will easily drop into the water.

, By tapping the A button on the right Wii Remote, your main character can swim on the surface of the water. Link will paddle left or right along the surface, and you can swim towards a specific direction by moving the analog stick of the left Wii Remote while continuously tapping the A button.

, To go below the surface of the water, press the Down button on the directional key on the right Wii Remote, or swing the right remote on a downward motion. Link will dive down, and you can now swim on all four directions—up, down, left, or right—by tapping the A button.


Note that you can only dive underwater once you have the Water Dragon’s Scale, which can be obtained by completing the “The Silent Realm - Faron Woods” quest during the earlier stages of the game. Once you have the Water Dragon’s Scale, you can dive underwater anytime at will.

, Even if you’re in the water, you can still switch to first-person view and closely look around you by pressing the C button on the left Wii Remote. The camera will zoom in and the game screen will turn into a first-person view. To go back to third-person camera view, simply tap the C button again.

, If you find an object underwater that you can target or observe, you can lock into it by pressing and holding down the Z button on the left Wii remote. The camera will immediately lock onto a targetable object near you.

, Enemies can be found even below the surface of the water, so you’ll still need to be able to defend yourself. Link can perform a spin attack with his sword by waving the left Wii Remote in an upward motion. Link will spin his sword around, propelling him upward while damaging nearby enemies. If he’s close enough to the surface, Link will jump out of water while spinning his sword.

, To get out of the water, simply go back to the surface and swim towards a nearby land or solid structure. Link will automatically climb out of water and back onto solid ground.


If you’re trying to get onto a ground that’s higher than the level of the water you’re in, try looking around for any vines or ladders that Link could use to climb up. Swim toward these structures, and your main character will automatically climb up and make his way up the higher ground.

"
"
The first phase tests your defense.,
Every time you attack, make sure it doesn't hit his sword or else it will reset the attacks you landed and you will have to start over!,
Repeat Steps 1 and 2.

",How to Defeat Demise in the Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword1," Any time you attack Demise, he will parry it with his sword. You can also wait for him to attack you if you don't want to risk losing health. When he prepares to strike, you shield bash or backflip. This give you an opportunity to attack.;
, Don't attack like a maniac or use a lot of attacks as Demise will fight back while you are open for them. Demise will fall to the ground after 4 consecutive hits. Simply swing rapidly until he gets back up.

,"
"
Before you start you must have the necessary items; Double Clawshot, Dominion rod, Ball & Chain, and spinner.,
You should also have the following; Magic Armor, Giant quiver, 3 bomb bags, 4 bottles filled with potion, fairies, & chu jelly and all hidden 7 skills.

,
Go to the cave of ordeals.",How to Beat the Cave of Ordeals Floors 1 to 10 in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess," These are needed on later floors.;
,, The cave of ordeals is located in the desert under where you found the piece of the bridge of Eldin.


Floor 1: 1 Bokoblin, jump in and attack
Floor 2: Keeses & Rats, spin attack works well
Floor 3: Hanging Baba Serpents, cut with clawshot, jump down and kill
Floor 4: 3 Skulltulas jump down, fire bomb arrows
Floor 5: 3 Bulblin Archers, jump down and attack
Floor 6: Torch Slugs, kill all on ceiling with clawshot, jump down and attack the rest
Floor 7: Dodongos & Fire Keeses, jump down and attack
Floor 8: Tektites, spin attack works well
Floor 9: 2 Lizalfoses & 2 Bulblin Archers, Archers first Lizalfoses second
Floor 10 Great Fairy, talk to her

Protect your sword.,
Swing your sword carefully like you did with the eye statue puzzles earlier in the dungeon.,
Attack.,
Counterattack.,
Dodge the knives.,
Deal with the last attack approaches.,
Be prepared for each attack.",How to Beat Ghirahim," Ghirahim will start testing your fighting skill during the beginning of this battle and will not attack you unless you do absolutely nothing. Walk up to him and take out your sword and shield to attack. Ghirahim will reach his hand and a red glowing sphere will emit from it. Basically, he’s trying to copy your movements so that he can grab your sword and use it against you; if you try to randomly hit him here, he’ll just grab your sword and attack you with it.;
, Mesmerize his hand to copy your movements. Then, stop moving your sword to allow Ghirahim to stop as well, and slowly move it the opposite position from where his hand is. Immediately attack him with your sword from that direction and repeat. If he successfully grabs your sword anytime, just raise your sword up or shake the Wii Remote to let go of his grip and start over.

, After using this strategy three times, Ghirahim will get accustomed to it and prevent you from hitting him. Now, all you’ve got to do now is to move your sword over to the exact position his hand is after you mesmerize and stop his movements, as opposed to swinging to the opposite position. After, just attack him with your sword by slashing him in the opposite direction of how you slashed him before. Repeat this process three more times to anger Ghirahim and to force him to change his fighting tactics.

, By this point you should already get used to fighting him this way and Ghirahim knows this too. He will then snap his fingers and summon a sword with magic to match your own and begin attacking. Here is where you have to be extremely careful of his attacks. Ghirahim will step back, crouch, and place his sword in front of him; this is a sign that he will perform a dash-attack. This attack will do a lot of damage to you if you aren't careful! When he comes running, the moment he comes to swipe his sword to attack, counterattack with a shield bash. If done quickly, he will become stunned, allowing you some free time to damage him a lot with your sword. You can also use a spin attack if you’re not so great at shield-bashing or if you don’t have one equipped with you.

, Another one of his attacks is summoning a column or row of small daggers (or kunai knives) and throwing them at you. Whichever way he throws it is whichever way you strike them back with your sword (i.e., hit up or down for vertical, and hit left or right for horizontal.) You can also dodge them or shield bash the daggers, but they will do no damage to them, so use that to your advantage if you want to quickly defeat Ghirahim.

, His two final attacks involve him ambushing you and striking his sword to injure you. When Ghirahim teleports, quickly run or dodge as he will appear behind or beside you and quickly strike back. Depending on how he holds his sword is how you must slash him with yours; if not, then you will get attacked by him unless you dodge his attacks. If he holds his sword vertically, attack from left to right or do a vertical spin attack. However, if he holds his sword horizontally, attack up to down or do a horizontal spin attack. (You can choose to run away from him to avoid heart loss but the battle will just take longer to beat.)

, Ghirahim will use these four attacks randomly, so be prepared to know what to do when he uses one of these attacks. Ghirahim may also use these attacks in consecutive times in a row and then switch to another attack and repeat, so always pay attention. When he starts ambushing you or using daggers to hit you more often than normal, then you know you are halfway to defeating him. If he starts using dash attacks a lot, you are almost done beating him. Destroy the pots surrounding the arena if you’re having trouble to restore your health and remember to use heart potions and revitalization potions if necessary. Use the Guardian Potion only if you are having extreme trouble defeating Ghirahim.

Wait for Ghirahim to give a long speech about how angry he is at Zelda.,

Be prepared for his new attack.,
Prepare for the last battle.,
Watch for Ghirahim's moves.,
Once he's knocked down to the next platform, Z-Target him and do a Fatal Blow.,
Knock him off balance with the shield.,
Hit it back at him the way he hit it.",How to Beat Ghirahim in Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword," Then begin the fight. Draw your sword and any potions you might have.;
, Don't hit it or he'll take your sword and throw it at you. Z-Target Ghirahim and slowly lower your sword. Then, quickly whip it up and hit him.

, This phase of the battle can be tricky, so step your game up.

, Do a slash in that pattern and some of the knives will rebound at him. (Or you can block with your shield, but some of the knives may still hit you.)

, Ghirahim sometimes charges at you at top speed. Keep him Z-targeted and jump to the side to avoid him at the last second and hit him. He'll eventually be defeated.

, He'll talk more, and then split open black armour. But fortunately, with our new powered up sword, this'll be easier.

, This time they protect him, and if you get too close, he'll shoot them at you. The best strategy is to wait for the knives to form a straight horizontal line, and then do a powered spin attack to hit Ghirahim and the knives. You can also hit the opposite way the knives form a line in (e.g., If Ghirahim has the knives starting at the right corner and going down to the left diagonally, hit vice versa.).

, Ghirahim will be angered, and conjure not one, but two swords! Ghirahim will charge at you in the last battle, and use the same strategy to avoid and harm him.

, Ghirahim jumps into the air and disappears for a second, and then jumps back down. Stand still and wait. As soon as you see him coming down, Z-Target, backflip, and then jump forward and slash. After doing this a few times, you'll finally beat him.

, As soon as you beat the Horde and get to the bottom of the Sealed Grounds, Ghirahim will confront you. This time, as cowardly as he is, he will send a crowd of Bokoblins to hurt you. Beat them using your sword only (they each die in one hit), and get ready to face Ghirahim for the third and final time. 

, This battle is the easiest but longest. Ghirahim will turn completely black, and raise orange platforms into the sky. This time, Ghirahim will slowly pace around the platforms, and sometimes attack you. He'll grunt before he hits, so use your shield (the Hylian Shield will stun him for the longest) to stun him, and then hit him. The goal is to knock him to the edge of the platform and then hit him off.

, Knock him off a few more platforms, and you'll be in the center of the Sealed Grounds.

, He will now have a huge sword. After a few perilous moments, Ghirahim will curse you, and start fighting with even more skill. He'll do the charge, and a reddish Skyward Strike.

, When Ghirahim blocks with his sword, hit the chinks to destroy it and hit him. Finally, at long last, Ghirahim will be defeated! After a few cutscenes, he will die at the hands of Demise.

"
"
Eventually, the sky will turn even darker, the arena will start to rain, and lightning will strike.,
Demise will release his Skyward Strike.,
Raise your sword to the sky, and eventually the electricity will absorb your sword.,
If the previous step is done correctly, Demise will fall to one knee.,
Repeat.

,
Occasionally, Demise will perform a dash attack that will damage and electrocute you if not careful.,
When Demise is weak enough, he will fall back-first.,
Congrats!",How to Defeat Demise in the Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword2," Demise's sword will be absorbed by the electricity. If you try attacking him, you will be shocked. You cannot use the Skyward Strike.

, Sidestep or quickly roll away.

, Quickly unleash it on Demise before he runs up and strikes you down or blocks your Skyward Strike with one of his.

, Keep hitting until he gets back up without attacking too much or you will lose focus and Demise can attack without you defending yourself fast enough to.

,, Either backflip or shield-bash at the last moment. You can always prevent this by going close but not too close and tempting him to hit you after he gets up you attack him.

, Quickly deliver an Ending Blow before he gets back up and you have to go through a short form of phase 2. This will always fail the first time, but if you are very fast, the second time you can finish him. If not, you can always try again for the third and fourth time.

, You've beaten The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. Enjoy the ending, and wait three years for the next.

If you've decided to use Bombchus, equip them.,

Lookout for its armor to change.,
Continue using the same tactic of battling it until it's defeated.

",How to Defeat an Iron Knuckle in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask," It will be sitting on a throne in the dimly lit room. Make sure you have your sword and shield equipped. Then take a swipe at the Iron Knuckle.;
, It will either swing its ax twice in a horizontal motion, or swing it towards the ground.


The best way to avoid it is to Z-target the Iron Knuckle and backflip right before they strike. After it finishes its attack, hit it with your sword in the time it takes before its next attack.

, For the first phase of the battle, the Iron Knuckle moves slowly and steadily. You have a few choices of how to beat him. Equip the following items:

Bombs
Bombchus (if you have them)
Sword (Biggoron's Sword recommend)
Hylian Shield
Nayru's Love (optional, but makes the battle easier)

, Z-Target the Iron Knuckle. Make sure that it's far away from you. Back up and throw a bomb at him. This is the safest way to beat him, but it's slow and takes lots of bombs (you probably need the bomb bag update if you want to do it this way), and can be dangerous in such tight quarters., This method is slightly safer than using Bombs, but still not the best way. Z-Target the Iron Knuckle and let loose a Bombchu. This method takes lots of Bombchus; you might not have enough space to keep all the Bombchus you'll need. Using Bombchus makes for a slow, boring battle (but that's what some people want)., Z-Target the Iron Knuckle and wait for him to move towards you. Step (cautiously) towards him, and wait for him to swing its axe. You can either side step or jump back.

The Iron Knuckle's axe will be stuck in the ground, and you can hit him then. Remember, stay well out of reach but close enough to hit him (Biggorn's Sword can accomplish this feat nicely).

, Wait for its axe to get stuck in the ground, and then step forward and beat him up. Make sure to stay so close that it can't swing again., Halfway through the battle, it will lose its armor. Without its armor, it will move faster, and take less time between attacks.


Fortunately, this makes him more vulnerable. Keep bashing him until it crumples and dies. Walk through the opened door to receive The Mirror Shield!

, Pick it up and give it to the old lady. The old lady will thank you and give you the Blast Mask to show her gratitude.

Hit the four eyes under the body of the blue Twinmold with arrows.,
After defeating the blue Twinmold, a chest will appear in the middle of the arena.,
Put on the Giant's Mask and attack the red Twinmold either by punching it or throwing one of the large rocks spread around the arena at it.,
Once it's stunned by attacking it enough, or by throwing one of the large rocks at it, you can damage it by grabbing its tail and swinging it around, or grabbing its head to strangle it.",How to Defeat Twinmold in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D," Once you've done this, it'll crash into the ground, revealing its main eye. Hit it with any weapon, preferably arrows or your sword. Watch out for the red Twinmold, which will throw fireballs at you.;
, Open it to get the Giant's Mask.

, While attacking, you'll also want to defeat the Moldbabies, which can leave behind hearts.

Make sure you have all 24 masks to get Fierce Deity's Mask.,
Do the Swamp, Mountain, Ocean, and Canyon challenges.

,
Go up to the kid wearing the Majora's Mask and ask to challenge him to a boss battle.,
Attack the mask by hitting it from behind.,
Shoot about 3 arrows at each to kill them, while at the same time keeping an eye on Majora's Mask so he doesn't pull any sneaky tricks.,
Keep avoiding it until he starts spinning again so you can slash him.,
Stand in one place and wait for the mask to come near you.,
If it doesn't come near you, or you just don't feel like waiting for it to come near you, use a Light Arrow on it to make it fall.,
Beware, as this is the hardest form of Majora's Mask.,
Stay in one part of the room (facing the mask) and wait for him to whip you, then fire an arrow at him right before he whips you.

,
Use your other forms of Link to stun him.",How to Defeat Majora in Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask," If you don't, defeating Majora will be much harder.

,, The battle will start.

, No matter what you use, you won't be able to do any damage by hitting it on the front. Wait for it to start spinning on the ground, then do a spinning slash to knock it down to the ground, followed by a quick slash on the back before it gets back up.


Alternatively, you can wait for it to dive down at you, then run out of the way while wearing the Bunny Hood, then shoot an arrow at it from behind. After you hit it about 3 times in either of these manners, the four guardian masks will come from their portals and begin attacking you with light orbs.

, Once the masks are gone, the mask will constantly use its fire beam attack.;
, If you want, you can deflect the attack with the Mirror Shield to stun the mask. Soon enough, he will be dead, but he then re-incarnates himself.

, When it's within range of your sword, slash it to make it stop moving, then continue to slash it with the Gilded Sword (or whatever sword you have) until it spins away again.

, Run up and slash it with your sword. This is the easiest form of the mask, and it shouldn't take very long to kill.

, He will use his newly grown tentacles to whip at you, and it's almost impossible to avoid his attacks.

,, Hit him with any Light Arrows you have left. A good method is to turn into Zora Link, get close to him while using Zora Link's shield to block his attacks, and use Zora Link's magic barrier (press B while holding up your shield) to stun him when you get close enough. When he begins to dodge your attacks, try to stun him with any of Link's forms. Run up and hit him with your sword or any remaining items that can do damage. He will soon be defeated and you can view the ending of the game in peace.


To defeat all three forms as Fierce Deity Link, just use the same methods, only it will be much easier as FDL, because he has a more powerful sword than normal Link.

Place the speakers.,
Place the receiver near the TV.,
Run wire from the speakers to the receiver.,
Connect the speakers to the receiver.,
Connect the TV to the receiver.,
Connect other devices to the receiver or TV.,
Test and calibrate your speakers.",How to Install Speakers1," Speaker placement is very important for home theater audio quality, and speakers should be placed before you start measuring out wire. Speaker placement is highly dependent on where the primary viewing spot is. This is typically your main couch or sofa. Your speakers will work best when focused on this location. Below are some tips for placing your various speakers:Subwoofer - The subwoofer's sound is omnidirectional, which means it doesn't need to be pointed in a specific direction. You can achieve good subwoofer sound from most locations in your living room, but try to avoid placing it near a wall or corner. It's often easiest to place it near the entertainment center for easy connecting.
Front Speakers - Place the front speakers to each side of the TV. Typically you will want the front speakers about 3 feet (0.9 m) (0.9 m) between the side of the TV and the speaker. Angle each speaker so that it is pointed towards the center of the listening location. For optimal audio quality, raise the speakers so that they are ear-level when sitting.
Center Channel/Soundbar - The center channel bridges the gap between the front channels. Place the center channel either above, below, or in front of the TV. placing the center channel behind the TV will result in muffled sound.
Side Speakers - These speakers should be placed directly to the sides sides of the listening area, pointed at the listener. The speakers should be ear level.
Rear Speakers - Place the rear speakers behind the listening area, angled towards the center of the couch. Like the other speakers, these should be ear level for the best sound possible.;
, The receiver can go underneath your TV in the entertainment center or off to the side, as long as it is close enough for cables to easily reach the TV. Make sure the receiver has room to circulate air on all sides.

, After all of your speakers are placed and the receiver has been set up, you can start running your speaker wire to connect it all. Make sure to leave some slack on each end so that you have room to move the speakers around and make adjustments.


For floor mounted speakers, you may be able to conceal the speaker wire along the base boards or under the carpet if you do not go by a door opening or fixed cabinet along the wall.
For ceiling mounted speakers, you will have to either drill through the ceiling and fish speaker wires down to the speakers, or recess the speakers into the ceiling itself. Recessing speakers into the ceiling may compromise the attic insulation and will make it difficult to aim the acoustic cone of the speaker.

, After you've laid out your wire, you can start hooking everything up. Some speakers will come with wire already attached, while others will require you to connect the wiring yourself. If you need to connect the wires yourself, you may need a wire stripper to peel back some of the coating.


Hook the speaker wires to the terminals on the back of the speaker box, being careful to observe the polarity (+ or -) of the connections. Many speaker wires are color coded, black being positive (+) and white being negative (-). Clear insulated wires have a copper conductor in the positive (+), and a silver colored conductor in the negative (-).
You may have to connect bare wire to the back of the receiver as well. Double check to ensure that you are connecting the right speakers to the right inputs on the receiver.

, In order to get the sound from your TV to come out of your receiver, you will need to connect the TV to the receiver. HDMI is usually the easiest way to do this, though many setups use optical cables to transfer the sound to the receiver.

, Depending on how you are routing your sound, you can connect your other devices such as DVD players, Blu-ray players, and cable boxes to either the TV or the receiver. See the device's documentation for detailed instructions.

, Now that everything is hooked up, it's time to test! Many receivers and TVs have sound tests that you can perform, and some modern receivers have automatic calibration tools. Experiment with music and movies and adjust the levels for each channel until you find a suitable mix.

Determine the speaker setup.,
Find the speaker connectors on your computer.,
Understand the color codes.,
Place your speakers.,
Connect the satellites and center channel to the subwoofer (if necessary).,
Plug the speakers into the appropriate jacks.,
Test the speakers.",How to Install Speakers2," You may have a single speaker, two satellite speakers, a subwoofer and two speakers, or a full surround system. Computer speaker setups are often less involved than a home theater, but full-surround systems can still have a lot of pieces.

, Most computers have speaker jacks on the motherboard connector panel, located on the back of the tower. If you are using a laptop, your only speaker port may be the headphone jack, or there may be ports located along the back of the laptop. The location will vary depending on the computer, so refer to your documentation if you are having difficulty locating the plugs.


If you are using an older computer, you may need to install a sound card in order to connect speakers. This usually isn't required for anything built within the last ten years.

, Nearly all computer speaker ports are color coded. These colors will help you determine which plug goes where. Most speaker cables will be color coded to match these jacks.


Pink – Microphone
Green – Front speakers or headphones
Black – Rear speakers
Silver – Side speakers
Orange – Center/Subwoofer

, Make sure that you can identify the Right and Left channel cables. If you are setting up a full-surround system, place your surround speakers to the sides and behind your computer chair, angled towards the chair. If you are just setting up two speakers, placing them to the sides of your monitor angled towards you will result in good sound quality.

, Different speaker models will connect to each other in different ways. Sometimes, you will need to connect the satellite speakers to the subwoofer which then plugs into the computer, while other times each set of speakers gets plugged into the computer separately.

, Match the speaker cable plug colors to the matching colored jacks on your computer. You may have to twist the plugs if space is tight.

, Power on the speakers (if necessary) and then turn them all the way down using the physical volume control. Start a song or video on your computer and slowly raise the volume until you can hear at a comfortable level. Once you've confirmed that the speakers work, find a channel test online. This will help you ensure that your speakers are placed correctly."

Determine which speakers your stereo supports.,
Make sure the speakers will fit.,
Gather your tools.,
Disconnect the battery.,
Read the included instructions.,
Remove the speaker grille.,
Remove the old speaker.,
Cut holes (if necessary).,
Wire the new speaker.,
Test the speaker.,
Mount the speaker.",How to Install Speakers3," Speakers draw power, and some stereos may not be able to handle too much extra draw. Refer to your stereo's documentation when installing new speakers, especially if you are adding additional speakers or replacing existing speakers with high-power replacements., Some speakers are designed to fit into existing speaker locations, while other will require modifications such as cutting away the panel or installing mounting brackets. Take all of this into consideration when choosing speakers to install.

, The tools you need will vary wildly from car to car. The location of the speaker you are installing will also have an impact on the tools you need. In general, however, you will probably need the following:A variety of screwdrivers. Phillips, flat head, offset, and more.
Torx driver
Drill and bits
Allen wrenches
Wire cutter/stripper
Soldering iron
Crimping tool
Panel removal tool
Electrical tape

, Before working on anything electrical in your car, it is always recommended that you disconnect the power. Locate your battery and find the appropriate socket wrench that fits the lug on the battery terminals. Disconnect negative (black) terminal and move the cable gently to the side.


See this guide for detailed instructions on disconnecting a car battery.

, There are too many different possibilities to be covered effectively in this guide. For specific instructions for your speakers, refer to the included documentation or look up the manual on the manufacturer's website. Always defer to the manufacturer's instructions.

, These can usually be pried off, though there may be screws to remove. If you are doing this on the front of the dash under the windshield, you may need an offset screwdriver.

, Speakers are usually screwed into the panel, so remove all the screws before trying to pull the speaker out. Take care not to rip out the wiring harness that is usually present. The speaker may be glued to the enclosure, so you may have to pry it off.


Unclip the speaker from the wiring harness after removing it from the panel. You will be plugging your new speaker into this harness. If there is no harness, you will need to cut the wires.

, Sometimes the speaker you are inserting will not fit exactly into the existing enclosure. If this is the case, use your drill to cut out enough space for the speaker. Make sure to measure the new speaker and mark the enclosure so that you don't cut away too much.

, Most speakers simply clip into the existing wiring harness. If you don't have a wiring harness, you will need to solder the new speaker to the existing speaker wire. Make sure that the positive and negative wires are properly connected. The positive terminal on the back of the speaker is usually larger than the negative one.


Avoid using electrical tape to hold bare wire together, as it will likely warp and lead to a bad connection down the road.

, Before mounting the speaker, reconnect your car battery and then test the speaker. Make sure that the sound coming out isn't distorted, and that the speaker is visibly moving at higher volumes. You'll want to ensure that it is properly wired before you finish the mounting process.

, After confirming that the speaker is working properly, mount the speaker using any included mounting brackets and screws. You may want to use an adhesive to help keep it in place. make sure that the speaker is secure so that it doesn't rattle and create excess noise.

Decide if you can live without a stereo program or not.,
Do your homework.,
Determine the amplifier inputs.,
Make sure the amplifiers provide an audio output on a ""voltage of either one or more of the following: 25, 70 or 100 volts; not as an output to match a 4 to 8 'ohm speaker input impedance offered by traditional receiver / amplifiers used at home.,
Ensure the audio transformer voltage matches, at least, one that is available on the amplifier.,
Know that speaker and audio transformer power ratings are often expressed in watts.,
Use a wire size large enough to provide the power needed at the furthest speaker.,
Don't settle for tinny sound.",How to Install a Commercial Sound System," Stereo is a good choice in smaller spaces and rooms that allow the occupants to hear both the left and right program from nearly anywhere in the room.

When rooms get larger or longer; or if the space is one located outdoors, (deck, patio, etc.) it becomes increasingly more difficult for occupants to hear anything other than the closest speaker, which will reproduce only either the left or right portion of a stereo program.
A monophonic audio (as opposed to a stereophonic) program ensures that every speaker reproduces the combined left and right program and is ideal for these situations.;
, These systems aren't particularly difficult to setup, but do require some specific equipment that is not usually sold in stores that sell ""stereo equipment"". This wiki should be considered a starting point to help you to at least know which questions to ask - while providing some answers at the same time.

After the stereo or mono question above has been answered, the first thing you'll need to know is how far apart the speakers will need to be - based on the type and size of the area served and the height above the listening area they will be placed. Then, how much power each should be capable of providing - which will help determine the power output rating of the amplifier needed.
There are charts and websites to help you determine speaker placement that can be found by searching ""distributed audio speaker placement"" in your favorite search engine.

, Amplifiers with more than one input, separate level controls, and a Master Volume control also functions as a ""mixer"". A mixer combines or mixes 2 or more low-level inputs, provide amplification and output them on a single, monophonic speaker output. This means an amplifier should have 2 inputs for each stereo source.

By mixing the left and right channel of the stereo source device (MP3 player, streaming audio device, CD, etc.) to output on a single monophonic output - the full range of the source sound is delivered to the speaker - instead of having to choose either the left or right channel of the source device.
Directly connecting a source audio device's left and right channel together and inputting the resultant signal into an amplifier's input can damage the source audio device. A two-input amplifier should be used for one stereo audio source device, a four input amplifier would be fine for two stereo audio source devices, a six input amplifier would be fine for three stereo audio source devices, and so on.
Of course, a mono source device would require only one amplifier input. The amplifier's level controls help match the input signal levels. These may consist of a simple knob, an adjustment made by turning a small screwdriver or by positioning a switch between High, Medium and Low.
If you had an MP3 device on input 1 and 2, a streaming internet audio source on input 3 and 4 and a CD player on 5 and 6 - you might have MP3 inputs 1 & 2 set to low or ""3"", internet audio inputs 3 and 4 set high or ""8 or 9"" and CD inputs 5 and 6 set to a middle point or ""4 or 5"". This would help the speakers play each input at nearly the same volumes without having to make changes to the master volume control every time a different source was selected.

,

The drawback to these voltage based systems are the inefficiencies or ""insertion loss"" of the audio transformer(s) that are required at each speaker. The insertion loss of the audio transformer results in systems that are only about 60% efficient. Thirty to 40% of the audio power is lost as heat and magnetism (into free air) in the transformer instead creating magnetism in speaker's voice coil - which results in movement and making a sound. What does that mean?
If a system had 10 speakers; 5 set at 5 Watts and 5 set at 2 Watts - that would be a total of 5x5W=25W + 5x2W=10W for a total of 35Watts. Assuming 60% efficiency, we would need an amplifier capable of 35 x 1.666 (if 60% efficient) or 58 Watts, minimum to power this system. A 60W amp will sufficiently power the speakers, but will lack the ability to add any additional speakers - so it may not be a wise choice.
Here's why: A 120W amplifier would be much less costly than purchasing a second 60W amp and all the work to integrate it with the existing 60W amp. Selecting a 90 or 120-watt amplifier, simply extending the speaker wires and add speakers as needed up to the capacity of the amplifier. You can calculate it from the amplifier instead; 120-watt amplifier driving 60% efficient speakers is calculated as 120W x .60 (60% efficient speakers) = 72 watts.

, It is not unusual for 2 or more different input voltage ""taps"" to be available. Most commercial speakers include a built-in audio transformer. The audio transformer specifications will list voltage(s) and wattage(s) rating.

Make sure the audio transformers used will (1) provide enough power and (2) have a matching voltage rating as the amplifier. Selecting a transformer that is rated for 70V and 20W for use on a speaker that is rated for 10W is a waste of money (a 10W transformer often costs less than a 20W equivalent) and could result in poor audio quality - especially at louder volume levels.

, Since most of these systems are designed for background music and utilize many speakers - you won't need a great deal of power to each one. Speakers that have multiple power selections will be helpful. Many are set up to provide 4 or 5 power settings that typically double at each selection ie: .25W, .5W, 1W, 2W, 5W. Some speakers have power levels that must be selected by wiring at the time of installation and others have external selector switches that can be changed ""on the fly"" as needed (others provide for a variable volume control - which is not to be confused with a power or wattage rating). Others have fixed power ratings and cannot be changed without replacing the transformer. There are benefits to speakers that have multiple power selections. The wattage needed is determined by how far apart, how high and the number of speakers are needed to produce the sound at the level desired. Speakers need to be close enough so the sound level present in a location between them is not significantly less than directly under one. Overcoming ambient noise will come into play here, too. Power levels outdoors will often need to be substantially higher than similar size spaces indoors, as there are fewer (if any) walls for the sound to bounce off. Speakers that are not installed close to walls and / or floors will lack a low-frequency response when compared to those same speakers that are located on or near these surfaces., Small wires are easier to install and hide and they cost less to purchase, but wires that are too small will reduce power to the speakers. Make sure you select wire or cable that is UL or FM accepted and is rated for the space for which it will be installed. ""Plenum Rated"" cables have little to no toxic fumes when burned and as such, are permitted to be installed in ""return air plenum"". Others resist drying out in attics, wall spaces, sunlight, soil, etc.. Because commercial systems take a 40% ""hit"" in power due to insertion loss, it would be foolish to incur even more loss due to wires that are sized too small for the distance installed. Typical 70V systems can run very nicely on #16 gauge copper wire over great distances. Calculate the the distance from the amplifier terminals to the last speaker terminals for each ""run"" Next, add up the speaker wattage. Use the table below to determine the combination of wire size, cable distance or speakers for the system. Ex: 10 speakers @ 5w each equals 50w total. A 50w system can have up to 1,400 (1.4k) feet of #16 cable. A system supplied with the smaller #24 gauge wire on the other hand, can only be served by no more than 210 feet (64.0 m) of cable. See the table below:

Read speaker wire gauge from large to small from top to bottom in the left most COLUMN labeled ""Gauge"". The speaker wattage totals are listed across the top ROW. The result is the maximum DISTANCE (or length of the circuit) in feet for the speaker wire.

, Get the low audio frequencies back in your system. Many speakers are small in size and are simply incapable of moving the volume of air needed to reproduce even the most subtle low frequency effects or ""bass"". Like traditional sound systems, recovering the bass is done with speakers designed specifically for that purpose. An un-amplified (or ""passive"") sub-woofer of your choice (with the aforementioned properly sized audio transformer connected) will work nicely in a system like this. A sub-woofer is generally physically larger than the other speakers so that they can move enough air needed to reproduce low frequency effects. These Low frequency sounds radiate in omnidirectional patterns, so it is difficult for people to determine the origin of the sound. This makes sub-woofer placement easy to do in an out of the way place. Other technologies are employed by companies that give small speakers bigger, deeper sounds but often come with a price tag to match. The more surfaces a sub-woofer has near it - the deeper it will sound. The deepest sound will come when the sub woofer is in a corner - where it will benefit from 3 nearby surfaces such as two walls and the floor. If a corner isn't possible, 2 surfaces such as a wall and floor would be the next best choice."

",How to Fiberglass Speaker Boxes," It is highly undesirable to allow dust to collect on the fiberglass resin. If you're working in the trunk or any part of the car that has carpeting, it advisable to remove it.;
, Cover any surface where you do not want resin dust. Tape the edges of the plastic down.

, Criss-cross the layers to ensure that the area is fully covered.

, The amount depends on the size of the speaker box you want to make. Read the instructions on the resin and keep mixing more as needed.

, Strips that are 2 inches (5 cm) wide and 1 foot (0.30 m) (30 cm) long should be adequate. Cut the strips into smaller pieces if you are fitting them into a tight space.

, Saturate them, but do not soak them so much that you drip resin everywhere. Carefully place the strips over the taped area one at a time. Cover past the edge of the speaker box, as you will trim the edges later.

, It does not have to be completely dry. If you don't use a blow dryer, allow at least 1 hour for the resin to set.

",How to Extend Speaker Wires,";
,


The wire for each speaker should actually be two wires consisting of a stranded metal core covered by a flexible insulation.
One strand is the positive. The other strand is the ground. These usually are identified in someway, for example, one may have a bump along the length of the insulation another a white line and yet another may have a copper colored wire while the other wire is silver. This way you can identify the positive and negative wires.
The end of each wire should already be separate or split, forming a “Y‿ shape of only a few inches.
The tips of each “Y‿ should already be stripped, exposing about a half-inch of the bare metal strands.

, Speaker wire is available in an assortment of thickness or gauges. This may be marked on the wire or you may find it in literature for your home amplifier. Make your best approximation if you cannot determine the exact gauge.

,,


Measure the distance needed to extend your speakers’ existing wire.
Cut one length of new wire based on each of your measurements.

,


Split a few inches of each end of the new wire, forming a “Y‿ shape.
Strip the insulation from the tip of each strand exposing about a half-inch of the bare metal strands.

, There are a few methods to do this. The best connection is made by soldering the wires and putting heat shrink tubing around the solder point. Other methods are the use of wire nuts or crimped connectors. Soldering or crimping requires the use of a soldering iron or crimping tool. Without access to these specialized tools, wire nuts are the best choice.


Pick up the prepared end of the new wire and the end of the existing wire. You should be holding four exposed metal tips.
Match the existing positive wire to the new positive wire. There may be a marking on the insulation to indicate positive. The metal strands may be a different color to indicate positive.
Make the electrical connection. If using heat shrink tubing, slide a piece of tubing long enough to cover the solder connection onto one of the wires before making the connection.

For wire nuts: In one hand, hold together one exposed tip of your existing wire and one exposed tip of your new wire. Position these exposed tips side by side, held between your thumb and forefinger.
With the other hand, place a wire connector over the merged tips. Twist clockwise. Inside the connector, the bare metal tips will twist together and screw firmly into the connector. The connector will insulate this splice.
For soldering: Twist together the exposed tips and perform the soldering process.
For crimping: Feed the prepared ends of the wire into the wire connector and crimp the end. There are many products to do this; some look like wire nuts that are crimped, and some look and operate completely differently. Read the directions for the particular connectors you have purchased.


Repeat this step for the ground wire of the set.
Each wire should now have two splices. Wrap a length of vinyl electricians’ tape around each set of wires or slide the shrink tubing to cover the wire connectors. Slightly stretch the tape as you wrap so that it adheres neatly to the insulation before and after the splice. To shrink the tubing, you will need a heat gun to evenly heat the tubing.

,, Usually, you insert the positive wire in a red connection. Insert the ground wire in a black connection.

Keep all of your source material clean.,
Minimize the vibrations incurred by each component.,
Minimize the electrical interference between each component.,
Upgrade your stereo system's wiring.,
Improve the acoustics of your room.,
Separate all your cables as much as possible.",How to Improve the Sound of Your Stereo System for Less Than $100," Dirt or oil on your CDs or vinyl LPs will keep them from sounding their best. Cleaning them regularly costs very little and can make a tremendous difference in the sound quality of your system. Vinyl can be cleaned with either mild soap and water or a mixture of alcohol and water. CDs are best cleaned using a commercial CD cleaning spray and a lint-free cloth.;
, The most important step you can take is to make sure that your speakers are not resting on the same surface as your source component (your CD player or turntable). The speakers will vibrate the surface when you play music, and those vibrations will impair the source component's ability to read the CD or LP. Speakers are best placed on separate stands.

, Each piece of your stereo system will create a small electrical field, which can interfere with the operation of other components. To remedy this, place each component a minimum of 1 foot (0.30 m) (30 cm) away from other components. In particular, the transformer in your amplifier or receiver will create a fairly strong field, so isolate it as much as possible. Never stack components on top of one another.

, A mistake many people make is buying expensive components and wiring them together with the cheapest cable available. A cheap cable will not be able to reproduce the fine audio detail generated from a quality component. To remedy this problem, buy higher-quality cables to re-wire your stereo system, like HDMI or Cat 5. This is a relatively cheap fix in relation to the overall cost of a sound system.

, Even a very high quality stereo system will sound awful in a room with poor acoustic properties. A common problem that you can easily eliminate is sound reflecting off of hard surfaces; these reflected sound waves obscure the clarity of the original audio. To fix this problem, increase the amount of soft material in your room; curtains and rugs work wonders for increasing sound absorption, for example.

, If you have many components in your stereo system, an inevitable mess of cables may result. Unfortunately, the signals carried by these cables can interfere with 1 another, causing humming and buzzing sounds over your audio. Make sure that cables cross as little as possible, and when they do cross, cross them at right angles.

Look for stereos with full-dynamic range.,
Note the wattage.,
Identify the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).,
Choose the right equipment for the audio source.",How to Determine the Quality of a Stereo1," “Range” essentially refers to how many types of sounds a stereo receiver can produce. Systems with a “full” range (between 20-20,000 Hz) will sound much more crisp and detailed than those with restricted ranges. This is one of the most important factors in determining overall quality.You can usually find a stereo’s audio specifications on the packaging, or somewhere on the unit itself.
Avoid stereo systems that overemphasize a specific range. Too much high end (sounds with a higher pitch) can be harsh and piercing, while a boosted bass may come through murky or muffled.;
, The stereo’s wattage, or power, translates to the number of decibels it can produce. This is worth thinking about about, as audio that sounds great at a medium level may begin to degrade at particularly high or low volumes. Low-wattage systems therefore won’t be the best choice for listening parties or other situations where you want the audio to be nice and loud.Most basic stereo systems have a wattage somewhere between 150-200 watts per channel. Musicians, DJs and other who need more power will want to look for a system closer to the 300-500 watt range.Higher wattage doesn’t always mean higher quality. Manufacturers often make their products louder in an effort to fool consumers into thinking that they perform better., See if you can locate the stereo’s THD rating among its technical details. This number describes how close the quality of the audio put out by the speakers will be to its original source. Power is one thing, but if there’s too big a difference between the receiver and the speakers, your listening experience will suffer.A lower rating indicates a truer sound—any distortion below about .1 percent will be practically unnoticeable, but it will become more obvious the higher the number gets.You may also be able to dig up a product’s THD rating with an internet search if it isn’t displayed on the unit itself.

, The source of the audio itself also plays a big part in how it will sound over a new system. Will you be using your stereo to stream music in high-definition or watch YouTube videos? You won’t be able to get an accurate reading of your system’s potential if you’re listening to underwhelming sources.A digital file with 320kbps quality, for instance, will sound crystal clear, whereas a grainy, low quality recording will be hard to listen to no matter what it’s played on.
Most stereo systems are optimized for a particular source, such as digital or CD. This can make it easier to find a product you’ll be satisfied with if you’re not that knowledgeable about audio equipment.

Analyze the break in your antenna.,
Cut a single, continuous sheet of aluminum foil.,
Rejoin the broken part of the antenna with your foil.Wrap your foil around the broken bottom of the top piece of your antenna until both parts are firmly joined.,
Wrap duct tape around your foil.,
Check quality and adjust as necessary.",How to Fix a Radio Antenna1," Many radio antennas have telescoping links that allow it to extend or detract. Find the link directly below the break in your antenna. This is likely the best place for you to apply your aluminum foil.;
, The radio signals in the air must be conducted by unbroken piece of foil. The signal cannot transmit across gaps in the metal, so using a single piece will help you prevent these from forming., Due to aluminum foil's malleable nature, your antenna will probably be somewhat flimsy until you apply your duct tape.

, This will insulate your break from the elements as well as strengthen the connection bridging the break in your antenna. Continue wrapping your duct tape until the foil is completely covered.

, Turn on your radio to see if your fix has improved your signal. If the signal is still poor, you may have a gap in your foil and will need to rewrap the antenna.


You may notice that different wrapping techniques have an affect on the clarity of your radio reception. Every antenna break will be different, so you may want to experiment with different ways of wrapping to find the best aluminum wrap for your break.

Listen for defects.,
Take price into consideration.,
Don’t be fooled by size.,
Go with what sounds good.",How to Determine the Quality of a Stereo2," Test your stereo with different sources and at different volume levels. Be sure to pay attention to any buzzing, static or distortion you might hear. Flaws like these are often signs that a sound system isn’t doing the audio justice.If possible, try playing the same source through different stereo systems (or the same stereo through multiple sets of speakers) so you’ll have a better basis for comparison.When shopping for a new stereo, ask if you can give each model a test listen in-store before you make a decision to buy it.

, As a rule, a superior stereo system will cost you more than a mediocre one. Those who aren't keen on the idea of shelling out thousands of dollars for a top-of-the-line model, however, should consider settling on a slightly less powerful system that will save them money while still performing to a high standard.

You can expect to pay at least a couple hundred dollars for a worthwhile stereo.If you’re on a budget, go with a basic receiver with a decent wattage, wider dynamic range and all the extra device inputs you need to enjoy your favorite music and movies., Rather than being wowed by the way a sound system looks, focus on its technical capabilities. Size and quality have very little to do with one another, and too many consumers make the mistake of assuming that the larger a stereo is, the more impressive it will sound. Remember: bigger doesn’t always mean better.It’s the hardware inside that matters, not sleek construction or fancy packaging.

, If you’re having trouble keeping up with all the technical details, set them aside and trust your intuition. At the end of the day, your own ears are the best judge for whether or not a stereo system is up to par.

Some audio characteristics, like the balance between high and low frequencies, are simply a matter of personal preference.

Gather your materials.,
Cut your soda can in a spiral strip.,
Flatten and trim your aluminum strip.,
Crease your strip so the outside ends meet.,
Attach your antenna to your antenna port, or to the unbroken end of your antenna.,
Stabilize as necessary.",How to Fix a Radio Antenna2," Having everything on hand to repair your antenna will save you time while repairing it. You will need a flat, clear space to work, and also:


A clean soda can
Sturdy scissors or shears
A pen
A book
Needle nose pliers

, You will first need to cut the top of the can free from the rest of it. Now you can begin a single cut that follows around the can at a gradual angle spiraling down to the bottom of your can. You should remove the bottom of your can after you are through cutting your spiral aluminum strip.


Take care when cutting your can; the aluminum may be sharp enough to cut you.

, Using a flat, heavy object (like a book), or even your hands, flatten your spiral strip entirely. Remove any particularly bad burrs or jagged edges from your flattened strip.Collect any shards or pieces of aluminum. These are sharp, and can result in cuts or slivers.

, Take your pen and run it along the middle of your strip to begin creasing your strip of aluminum. Bend the outside edges of your strip with your needle nose pliers or hands, drawing each side together above the crease you have made.The resulting shape of your aluminum will now be cylindrical.

, If your antenna has broken off close to the bottom, you may want to fold the outside edges of your strip around the remaining antenna nub. If your break is higher up on the antenna, wrap the outside edges around so that the antenna extends into your aluminum to stabilize the aluminum extension.


If your antenna has been torn out of its port completely, you may be able to narrow your aluminum to fit in the antenna receiver hole, but if damage has been done to the port, you made need to replace the antenna assembly completely.

, In some cases, you may be able to sheath your antenna with your now cylindrical foil. This may result in a stable junction. However, if your antenna is flimsy or you are concerned about the elements (wind should be a serious concern for car antennas), you can further support the break by wrapping it in duct tape or electrical tape.

, Some old P.A. heads may need to be wired through a quarter inch plug so depending on your head unit you may need to do a little extra work creating your own cables to hook everything up (make sure to insulate the wires properly so you do not get a short.)

, If there is a switch on the inverter you will also make sure it is in the on position. If the head unit powers up with out the inverter reading battery overload then you are fine to continue.

, If it is a 30A then the fuse box in your car also needs to have a fuse that is marked 30A (you can pick up fuses at Walmart for under five dollars).

,, Once you have taken the time to wire everything up so that the head unit turns on and the fuse to the cigarette lighter hasn't blown then you can move on with out worry.

, Once you have done this you may want to run a line from the outputs to the head unit. Depending on your stereo you may want to hook it to the sub line if you have a dedicated sub line. If you do not have a dedicated sub line then you may want to check for RCA outputs. These usually only carry a small signal so that they can be plugged into some for of amplification. If you only have these then you will want to run the line from your rear RCA outputs to your head unit.

, If it is three prong than it has a ground. You will want to find a way to take the ground and run a small line no longer than two feet in length to a metal spot on the car (with no paint either). If you do not have this there is a chance that you may get a lot of fuzz.

Purchase a bottle of contact cleaner which is labeled as ""safe to use on plastics."",
Look for a brand that offers quick-drying, no-residue application, as you won't be able to wipe many of the internal components dry.,
Avoid using products on your classic stereo equipment that are not intended for use on plastics in your stereo.,
Read and understand all labels on your contact cleaner and if you have any doubts, don't use it.,
Unplug your stereo equipment.,
Remove the cover of the stereo component.,
Spray compressed air throughout the unit's interior if needed.,
Spray contact cleaner on parts to be cleaned sparingly.,
Clean the potentiometers with contact cleaner.,
Clean the faders and buttons as you did the pots.,
Allow the unit to air out for several hours.,
Replace the component's case.",How to Clean Vintage Stereo Equipment," This is extremely important. Contact cleaner is a spray or liquid product that is designed to dissolve corrosion on metal electronic parts, typically the main cause of scratchy and popping sounds while moving volume controls or intermittent rotary or push-button switches (for speaker selections, modes, source) headphone or microphone jacks, etc. While all contact cleaners work on metal-only parts, most will actually destroy plastics and safe lubricants found inside and outside of almost every volume control potentiometer and switch.


Choosing a contact cleaner which will restore and not harm your equipment is always a better choice than using a low-cost contact cleaner, as replacing your original part once the hidden internal plastics cracked or melted, or the metal shaft seized, are often impossible and tedious at best, so you are better to not attempt to clean with a questionable product and instead live with the unit as it is until you can obtain a suitable contact cleaner which will not harm your precious treasure. You can usually purchase a safe bottle at a decent electronics store or over the internet though it is important to be certain shipping of the product is approved by the shipping service as many contact cleaners are flammable and sometimes cannot be shipped certain methods or to certain locations.;
, CAIG DeoxIt is a popular brand of contact cleaner and they have ""D5"" specifically for cleaning vintage stereo equipment correctly without harming the plastic components. They are an industry leader in contact cleaners for audiophiles and offer product support and product suggestions for specific applications. ""D5"" is an industry standard in the broadcast world and safely removes oxidation from the metals while avoiding harm to the internal plastic pieces and lubricants that most audio potentiometers contain., Avoid WD-40 (a renowned metal contact cleaner not always necessarily safe on all plastic parts) as it is not intended for use on most pieces that contain or touch plastic parts or have lubricants required to be able to turn. Testing before use may not be your option so use the online forums for advice first before trying something not reversible, you can save some headaches and heartaches., Damage cannot be undone. Equipment damaged or destroyed by contact cleaners which are not safe on plastics can sometimes end up on the internet (where you can't try before you buy) with no reference to seized or cracked controls so be careful to ask sellers if the knobs still turn or slide freely without excessive force or have shaft or neck breakage hidden by glued knobs etc. You can typically buy a few basic models of low-cost modern reproduction volume controls over the internet and test different contact cleaners on them to see what works and what doesn't before risking your stereo equipment's rare original pieces., To make sure that no electricity will be flowing through the internal components while you clean, unplug the audio equipment. Do not simply turn the power switch off; remove the plug entirely from the wall outlet as death could otherwise occur. Please note that a qualified technician should be at hand, and while many are unable to choose contact cleaners wisely, many can help you avoid a shock from a charged capacitor which can at least shock or burn your hand from skin to conductor contact even while the unit say unplugged for a long time. Be careful and look-up electrolytic capacitors for information.

, The case of the component is usually removed by loosening a few small screws or bolts. Often these screws will be located on the sides, back, and bottom of the unit. Not all screws on a given surface are for the casing so look carefully at what you are unscrewing so as to only remove the casing screws. After removing them, set them aside or put them into numbered containers in order to match them up with the correct holes you can put stickers on afterwards, taking pictures can help too, and gently lift the case away from the chassis.

, If the interior components look particularly dusty, you can clear away the dust using a spray can of compressed air. Do not attempt to wipe dust away using a cloth, as a clumsy hand can easily dislodge or damage delicate electronic components, or scratch a shiny plastic faceplate.

, Contact cleaner can be used to remove corrosion or stubborn dirt from many of the stereo component's internal parts, but typically you will want to clean contacts that cause problems beyond looks. Spray a fine, even coat of the contact cleaner on any component that is believed to be problematic due to oxidation, applying a thicker coat in areas that display significant corrosion. Spray jacks, plugs, any switches or removable connectors that are not soldered, and certainly battery contacts if any as these cause the most problems and may even require additional friction to clean or replacement if eaten away by alkaline battery acid.


The contact cleaner may air dry in a few hours; no wiping is typically necessary, but... avoid spray on things you don't want affected that should not be sprayed, such as rubberized belts, friction wheels, pulleys, motor shafts, meter displays, light bulbs, audio or video heads, window or dial faces. Good luck cleaning any of those off if they get a mist on them. Be certain to not soak high voltage power switches as they may at some point ignite so please don't flood your high voltage power switches with contact cleaners, they almost never need to be cleaned and are safer to replace if they would.

, The pots, or knobs, are the components most likely to display corrosion. To clean them, find the small hole in the back assembly of the pot or typically larger opening where the pins are soldered to the board. Spray sparingly an amount of contact cleaner into the hole or into the openings of which there are typically two separate openings for stereo potentiometers, and then work the knobs back and forth frequently for about a minute. This will spread the contact cleaner throughout the inside of the pot.

, To clean faders and push buttons, you'll have to sometimes spray the contact cleaner behind the controls from the front of the unit if access is impossible from the inside without major disassembly. After spraying the cleaner, push the button or slide the fader back and forth for about a minute. Any excess cleaner that drips down the faceplate of the unit can be wiped away with a microfiber scratch-resistant cloth.

, After applying contact cleaner to any part of your vintage stereo equipment, let the unit sit with the case off for a few hours. This helps ensure that all the contact cleaner has dried.

, Replace the case gently, and secure it using the screws or bolts you removed, screwed back together first by fingertip, then by screwdriver. Be certain to not force or over tighten as this can strip the threading and certainly crack any plastics easily. Remember the force required to undue the screws in the first place? Only after the case is back in place should you plug the audio equipment back in and test it. Any extra screws should mean rechecking your assembly because every screw is there for a reason otherwise manufacturers would save parts and time if it was not absolutely needed for safety or sturdiness. Good luck!

Use compressed air.",How to Clean iPhone Speakers2," If you can hear sound from your headphones after resetting the phone, there might be debris in the headphone port. This debris might be sending a false signal to the phone that the headphones are plugged in, thus preventing sound from playing from the speakers. Disconnect your headphones from your iPhone prior to cleaning the headphone port., Remove the cotton from one end of the cotton swab by pinching one end with your thumb and forefinger, then pulling your hands apart to remove the balled cotton. Once removed, discard the cotton. Pinch the same end again, loosely this time. Roll the cotton swab along its axis to spool some of the loose cotton upon itself. Put the cotton swab in the headphone jack. Gently guide the narrow end of the cotton swab into the headphone jack. Turn the cotton swab around a few times, then remove it.

Test the speakers to see if they work.Scrubbing the headphone jack with a cotton swab it the easiest and most common way to clean the headphone port.
Do not dampen the end of the cotton swab with water or rubbing alcohol. This could damage your iPhone.

, Lay the phone on a flat surface. Place the phone in such a position that its headphone port faces you. Aim the canned air nozzle at the headphone port from the distance recommended by the canned air’s directions label. Squeeze briefly, then release the handle.Canned oxygen is a common tool used to clean PC parts, and you should be able to buy some at your local computer or electronics shop.

One set of the 4CX800A tubes are probably all you will ever need, unless you overdrive the control grid loading them, and burn them out.,
Warm up time is a must for all tubes.",How to Find out if an Electronic Tube Is Good," All common tubes use a filament or heater, similar to the filament used in incandescent light bulbs. The function of the heater or filament is to heat up and release free electrons, which are then controlled by the other electrodes in the tube. Tubes with a ""directly heated"" cathode use the filament as the cathode. Tubes with ""indirectly heated"" cathodes have the filament encased within a metal tube, which serves as the cathode. Triodes have 3 electrodes: cathode, grid and plate. Tetrodes have 4 electrodes: cathode, control grid, screen grid, and plate. Pentodes have 5 electrodes: cathode, three grids - control grid, screen grid, suppressor grid and plate.;
, Unless you have some sort of protective circuit built in, many other parts can go up in smoke too.

, The 572B to the right was in normal service, but since it was poorly made in the production line, no insulator was placed between the wire feed coming through the top of the tube for the plate connection. When it got hot enough, it melted the solder connection and came loose, rendering this tube unusable till the cap is re-soldered with high temp solder. The way that they have made the pins on the bottom base of the tube, and the cap on the top, made this tube highly susceptible to early tube failure. The materials that are used to seal the air out of the glass envelope and bond the glass to the wire, deteriorate with time, and can let in air causing this tube to fail prematurely. High temperature sealants are used on all tubes, but all these sealants will, in time, break down, and allow some air into the tube. Poorly made tubes, like these, did not use the best sealants so they are even more susceptible to early tube failure.

, Regardless of what tube it was, how it was made was the same basic rule of thumb. Some tubes have indirectly heated cathodes, which is another part of a tube, that emit electrons, instead of the filament. It heats the cathode to a high temperature, and makes it emit electrons. It's a complex idea but the basics of a tube are simple.

, For reasons of ease of this discussion, we shall talk about the simple triode tubes used in Amateur Radio, and one commercial broadcast tube of the past, the old stand byes, the workhorse of their day!! But for fun, we also will include one ceramic tube. The pic is of a 4CX800A7 (8877). We will talk about the 4CX800A, a tube similar to the 4CX800A. The pic just shows the style of the ceramic tubes. All are pretty much based on the same scheme, except for the higher power KLYSTRON, and HIGH WATTAGE BROADCAST TUBES! They even have handles because they were so heavy and unwieldy. Most were either cooled by circulating water, or forced-air cooling.


The Eimac 3-500Z, and the common lovely bottle tubes 811A, with the 572B, used in Amateur Radio transmitters and power amplifiers, and the 833A, which was used in early Gates, Collins, Westinghouse, RCA and General Electric AM transmitters.
These tubes, all are TRIODES, meaning they have 3 working parts, all of which are necessary to their main function and operation, so lets start with the Eimac first. The 3 means it is a triode, 3 parts. The 500 was the power dissipation of the tube, and order number, and the ""Z"" stood for zinc plated plate, now replaced with graphite, so if you got a beautiful 3-500Z it had a zinc plated anode (plate). If it was a 3-500G, the plate is made of graphite.
The Filament was a coil of treated tungsten wire, rolled into a coil of the same tungsten wire, and the tungsten was coated with thorium, or radium, wound around a ceramic insulator. It took 6 volts at 25 AMPS ! This little tube had a powerful punch, and threw off some magnificent heat, as you might expect, using 25 AMPS of current! So much so it had to have constant flow of cool air and if it wasn't cooled by forced air through the cabinet, the soldered pins on the bottom of the tube would dislodge from the heat, and drop off. Some High Power RF amplifiers used Pyrex glass chimneys, and squirrel cage fans to force air around the tubes to keep them cool. They looked a lot like the Coleman lantern glass globe. The design of this tube was unlike any other, and it was a tried and true workhorse for the amateur radio hobby. It is still readily available tho, as we will discuss later. The element radium was found to be a little too strong in releasing electrons, so it was quickly taken from the tubes, and was seldom used, other than in experimentation tubes in a laboratory. Radium was, and still is used in some high performance X-ray tubes for medical purposes, along with Cesium.
One of the first tubes used for Amateur service, the 811A, has been around since the early days of radio. It's filament is in a large M design, and coated with thorium for electron emission advancement, running the full length of the plate,to holders, and between the grid. Really pretty looking when it is lit up. It first was used as an audio amplifier in some 30 to 50 watt loudspeaker systems, amplifying sound dramatically, then some bright engineer saw something else in this tube, and decided to fashion design it, and build around it, and make it into an RF amplifier tube. It's reliability under stress and high performance output, at the time, made it an excellent choice for use in Amateur Radio transmitters, and RF Power Amplifier circuits. The 811A only had one drawback, and that was the amount of PLATE VOLTAGE and PLATE CURRENT it could handle. Plate voltage and current are the key factors as to how much power you would be able to pull from any tube. The 811A plate RF dissipation was 150 to 200 Watts MAX.

, It may look big, but it's one of the smallest of the original amplifier tubes for an amateur radio amplifier. The tube in this pic is still good, but it also has some problems that make it less than perfect for normal use. It needs to be gathered , and tested before it will be returned to the amplifier, or transmitter.In Constant service, the plate voltage could not exceed 1000 Volts D.C. In intermediate commercial and Amateur radio, you could have 4 of the 811s running 1200 to 1500 Volts D.C. with about .300 milliamps of current on the plate, and still not damage the tube. Collins was probably the first to use this tube in a Power Amplifier class for Amateur Radio. RCA brought forth the super rugged, unbelievably powerful 572B, and its' replacement of the 811s meant that you could have more power output, with the new replacement tube. It would fit right into the same socket as the 811A, and it could handle from 2500 to 2800 Volts D.C. with about .375 milliamps of current on the plate. You could have a great deal more high voltage on the plate, and increase the plate current to about .375 milliamps, and not have the tube damaged, or gas up as much as an 811A would under certain circumstances. A few modifications had to be made to use this tube permanently with lower plate voltages.

, As you may conclude from these prime examples, Electron Tubes had to stay cool or a break down, and tube failure was inevitable. There were some tubes that were mini in design, specifically made that way to take up less space, and provide adequate amplification with a compact design. Let's talk about them in general terms for a few.


Early televisions used many types of tubes from small audio amplifiers, measuring half inch in diameter and one inch long, to one and three quarters inch diameter, five inches long sweep tubes, specifically designed and made for the picture tube, oscillating thousands of times a second. Some bright engineer made the connection of the sweep tubes and amplification of RF, and a lot of these cheap amp sweep tube design amplifier units were made under the guise of an amateur radio amplifier, and then converted over for use illegally on 11 meters ( CB BAND ) In fact, the 11 meter (36.1 ft) band was used by hams for years before the FCC chose this band to be used by the public. Hams did not protest this action, as this band was full of harmonic frequencies and would interfere with local TV channels, but it was a good band for use in making long distance DX contacts. This band unfortunately, is now unregulated, but the one rule that remain from the FCC is that you cannot run more than 4 watts output, but even so, most CBers use an RF amplifier on their CBs either at home or in a moving vehicle, and also, most of the CB amps are now transistorized

, Sweep tube amps are still around, although, they are on the outswing of being discontinued, and some sweep tubes cost more than a good 572B. Most of the more popular ones i.e. 6JE6C/6LQ6,6JS6C, 6LB6, 6DQ6 can be found from reputable dealers.


Sweep tubes that were constant service for TVs, were used to make high performance sweep tube style, base linears. They utilized the tube numbers, 6LR6, 6LB6,6LM6. 6RB6,6MJ6,6JT6 and the popular 6LQ6, which also was exactly the same as 6JE6C, so the manufacturers combined the numbers, 6JE6C / 6LQ6. The last 3 numbers, 6JS6C, 6LB6, 6DQ6 were used in Yaesu, Hallicrafters, and Drake Amateur Radios. Most of the new ones are either made in, and imported from China, or Taiwan. The ones that are made in France and England are high performance, high quality tubes. Eimac has stopped making tubes of the glass envelope types.

, There were several possibilities that could cause its failure, and all could be classed as the end result of a tube. The glass envelope may have burst. One of the pins could have shorted out, and melted off. The tube may light up but not function due to gas buildup in the glass envelope. The filament itself could have burned out, a common occurrence with vacuum tubes, or it just gave up after years of working well for you. Its also interesting to note that insects can cause a short between the plate voltage circuit, and the frame ground. Fried spiders, and roaches do not smell good. This temporary shorting of the circuit can cause damage, but it seldom happens if all the cabinet is intact.


The vacuum of the tube could lost due to just some of these things happening. Sometimes you could tell that the vacuum was lost by looking at the side of a tube, at what is called a getter, that supposed to collect, and store the gases the tube would emit while in operation. The getter may be silver in appearance when it was working, but if it turns white, or a gray color, you know the vacuum of the tube is lost, and it will not light up, or if it did, it would soon oxidize, and burn out.
This 811A is out of a matched set of 4 that served in a power amplifier for over 15 years. In normal use, and careful loading, your tubes will last a long long time. The most usable tubes were also made for the government during World War II. There are still electron tubes found in warehouses that were made in the 40's and 50's, and often, you can find some of these older tubes listed for sale on a military surplus buy.

, Here's a few that made all their tubes in America. RCA, G.E., Raytheon, CBS, Tung-Sol, Westinghouse, Phillips, Audiovon, Amperex, Taylor, Eimac, White Electric, Sylvania, Klytronics, American Electronic Development ( AED ) ( The A was in red, E was in white, and D was in Blue. Patriotic isn't it? ), Philco, and Zenith. Add more if you know them. Shortly after tubes started to be replaced with transistors, Philco sold out to Ford Motor Company. Amperex was sold to a French industry that kept the name, Phillips bought Westinghouse and then White Electronics bought Phillips / Westinghouse, Raytheon bought Audiovon, and then Klytronics went to producing other electronics. Zenith, Sylvania, Tung-Sol and RCA, went into producing transistors. The tube designs and patterns were given to Japanese companies who made them in bulk quantities, and sold them in America, then the Japanese went to making transistors. Technology has been improving since the first tube was designed and built by Marconi. Marconi had the right idea, and it has lasted for near a century.

, Subjecting a tube's filament to a line surge of DC overvoltage, or spike voltage and some high current could instantly destroy the cathode or filament of the tube, making it useless. Screen grids were made of tungsten and others of really durable wire, but they too, were made to only take so much stress, and they could collapse, or melt, touching the plate or the filament at anytime, causing the tube to ARC inside the envelope, and damage could result to other parts of the device. A very gassy tube could arc through the gas, and cause damage to your equipment.

, The early tube makers, constructed all tubes that they made by hand, and the positioning of the screen(s), plate and filament were crucial to their performance. If a grid or filament was too close, it could be magnetically, or from heat, stretched and short out. If the filament was already saggy, or not made of high resistance, high tolerance materials, and the tube was in a horizontal position, the filament could touch the grid, and short out. If it was set too far away, it would not function properly, or if it did operate, it did it very poorly. This was often the case on some early tubes, although the manufactures had astringent guidelines and scale molds to construct the tube, and weld the parts together. Raytheon was a large distributor and manufacturer of high performance, high quality tubes for the military, and for the radio industry. Phillips/Westinghouse had an entire assembly process for building, and testing all tubes that were manufactured during that time.

, The filament won't light up, or if there's a blue glow inside the glass envelope when in use, ( this means it is gassed ) or power output is below normal ranges, it would be considered bad, and the gassy tube would be called ""Soft"" due to it's inability to perform at normal output, and it's colored gas. The 811s and the 572s have getters to literally soak up the gas inside a tube, but there is a limit as to how much it will absorb, but the worst feeling is to look down the tubes envelope, and see black on the sides of the tube. This is carbon, and can signal tube failure is eminent. The 811s used to cost $5.00 each. Now if you can find the ones made in China, they sell for about $15.00 each. 572s were $11.00 not long ago, and now the ones made in China, which are not near as good as the ones made in the good ole USA, sell for about $38.00 each, and that's from reputable dealers. Here's the kick in the butt that hit the Amateur Radio Amplifier Owners, the 3-500Z or G tubes used to sell for $50.00 from Eimac, a generic brand called Cosmoz from China sell for $160.00 each ! Quite expensive, but still it's a needed part if you are a ham, and own an amp that uses the 3-500 style tubes.

, To act quickly, and hopefully degas the tube, you would remove the high voltage on the plate, and allow the tube to heat up by applying the filament power, and let it sit and ""cook"" for several hours. The Eimac 3-500Z or G, did not have getters. The plate would re-absorb the little gas by ""cooking"" this tube as described. Most sweep tubes had small getters, and would absorb the gas as it was made inside the tube with normal use.

, Makers of fine, but now obsolete, transmitters used this tube as the final output in their power amplifier stage. They were specifically designed to run high voltages, and moderate to medium high grid current, and to withstand considerable heat. Convection from fans positioned above or on the bottom parts of the tube mounting wand forced cool air through the entire transmitter cabinet, and then finally would draw up hot air by the tubes, to cool them down just enough for proper operation. If an 833A got too cold, its efficiency dropped dramatically. Forcing air through the cabinet first, warmed the air just enough to keep this tube in fine shape by not cooling it down too much. Where other tubes had to have air forced by them, the 833As design was meant to run hot.


The 833A was limited in service to Amateur Radio, since it's design was for the commercial broadcast band, ( 500 Khz to 1700 Khz ) and not for Amateur bands. A ham could have limited success using it on the 160 meter (524.9 ft) band since its frequencies are 1800 Khz to 2000 Khz. ( or in Amateur Radio Talk, its 1.800 Megahertz to 2.000 Megahertz ) Still means the same thing, just in different calibration numbers.

, Ceramic tubes replaced the glass bottle tubes years ago, and out perform the glass bottle tubes in a big way. It's hard to test and getter these tubes unless you have a tube tester that will do this job in one step. You can't see the filament in a ceramic tube, but it does its job just the same. High performance tubes such as the 4CX800A tubes from Russia's Svetlana production line gives super high performance with just two tubes. You can easily get over 2 kilowatts of RF power from 2 of these tubes, and they are just loafing at that wattage! An Amateur Radio Operator in the USA is licensed for only 1500 watts PEP power. QRO technologies make a 3 tube model, but it can only be exported. It has not been approved for sale here in the USA. The 2 tube model looks good, and most Amateurs would love to have one someday on their amateur radio bench. Talk about being a lover of high wattage, the guys at QRO really can build great amps but the prices are also high. You only get what you pay for when it comes right down to the facts. An amp of this quality would be a lifetime investment for a serious ham.


Although, hard to tell about ceramic tubes, purchasing them for use from a dealer outside of the USA is also super tricky. Make sure that if you use another set of cheap ceramic tubes, that they are tested and gettered so they don't destroy your amplifier. An arc thru gas in these tubes WILL cause severe damage to other components in your equipment. It will also destroy the tube within milliseconds! YES, THEY ARE THAT SENSITIVE~! Get a written report as to each tubes performance, and how the testing was done.
Back in the heydays of tubes, RKO had a tube tester in many supermarkets, drug stores, and even in car dealerships at one time. They sold many different brands, but most were made in the USA, and to be on the safe side, all tube sellers would run a quick check on the tube you brought in, to see if it was usable, or weak, before they sold you a replacement. Those were the days! You did not have to buy them ""as is"" and hope they were good. A normal amplifier tube like the simple 50C5 sold for .91 cents. The power amplifier tube of a normal black and white TV was only $2.00. You can see that times have changed, and so has electronics.

, They are TETRODES, 4 parts, Filament, Plate, Control Grid, and Screen Grid, and loaded in milliamps by variable capacitor loading on the control grid. They still are a rugged tube, and great for amateur radio use, but from now, it is hard to test and getter the ceramic replacement tubes unless you have a ceramic tube testing, and gettering device.

, There is a delay in most tube type devices before they will make a sound, so it stands to reason that any commercial radio, or amateur radio tubes in the equipment, needs to be warmed up before use. Some tubes are cold start tubes.. The Eimac 3-500 series has a cold filament start, but letting them warm up a few minutes before use is not a bad idea at all. The bottle tubes mentioned 811A and the 572B have minimum warm up time of 10 seconds before use, but again, letting them warm up may increase the life of the tube, and be ready to go to full power when it is necessary. The ceramic tube also has a warm up time of not less than 3 minutes. Sweep tubs should be warmed up at least 5 to 8 minutes to prevent them from being too cold, and damaging the tubes.

Apply the conversion formula for DC electricity.,
Understand power factor (PF) for AC electricity problems.,
Calculate apparent power to find your power factor.,
Use the power factor for single phase AC electricity.",How to Find Amps1," Electric current, represented by I, which is measured in amps (A), can be found by dividing power in watts (W) by the volts (V) of voltage. This is represented by the following formula:


I(A) = P(W) / V(V)Or, more simply: Amps = Watts / Volts;
, Power factor is a ratio representing the real power used to do work and the apparent power supplied to an alternating current circuit, a value ranging from 0 to 1. Therefore, power factor is your real power P, in watts, divided by your apparent power S, measured in Volt-amper (VA), or:


PF = P / S, Apparent power can be calculated by
S = Vrms x Irms

where S is the apparent power in Volt-amper (VA), Vrms is your root mean square voltage and Irms is your root mean square current, both which can be found by solving the following:


Vrms = Vpeak / √2 in volts (V)
Irms = Ipeak / √2 in amperes (A)

, Your single phase current will be represented by I and measured in amps (A), and can be calculated by dividing the real power (P) measured in watts (W) divided by a power factor (PF) multiplied by the root mean square (RMS) voltage as measured in volts (V). This is represented by:


I(A) = P(W) / (PF x V(V)Or, more simply: Amps = watts / (PF x Volts)

Make sure your current is DC.,
Determine the path of electricity.,
Test your circuit.,
Switch off your circuit.,
Tie in the positive end of your ammeter.,
Complete the circuit with the negative lead of your ammeter.,
Turn on your circuit.",How to Find Amps2," DC electricity, or direct current electricity, is electrical current that flows in a single direction. If your circuit is powered by a battery, the current used will be DC.In most countries, the electricity provided by utility mains is AC current (also called alternating current).AC current can be converted to DC current, but only through the use of a transformer, a rectifier, and a filter., To take the reading of the amperage of your circuit, you will need to tie your ammeter into your circuit. Follow the positive and negative ends of your battery and the connecting wires to find the circuit path.

, If there is a break in the circuit or a flaw with your battery, your ammeter will likely not be able to gauge (or will not gauge accurately) the current of your circuit. Turn on your circuit to see if it is functioning normally.

, For some simple circuits, this might require removing the battery completely. With more powerful batteries, there is a possibility that you could be shocked, so take care to make sure the circuit is off. If you are unsure, use insulated rubber gloves to prevent getting shocked.

, You ammeter should have come with two leads: one red and one black. The red lead is your positive end (+) and the black your negative (-). Take the wire leading from the positive end of your battery and tie the end leading away from your battery to the positive end of your ammeter.The ammeter will not interrupt the flow of electricity, but as current flows through the meter, it will measure the current, causing a reading to display.

, Take the black (-) lead from your ammeter and use it to complete the circuit you have just broken. Clamp the lead onto the location where the wire you have tied to your positive lead would have fed into its destination in the circuit., This might simply mean reinstalling your battery, but when you do so, your device should turn on and your ammeter should read the current in either amps (A) or milliamps (mA) for smaller current devices."

Familiarize yourself with the concept of Ohm's Law.,
Determine the voltage of your circuit.,
Find the resistors in your circuit.,
Apply Ohm's Law.",How to Find Amps3," Ohm's Law is a electrical principle that establishes a relationship between the voltage and current of a conductor.Ohm's law is represented by the formulas V = I x R, R = V/I, and I = V/R, with the letter terms defined as:


V = the potential difference between two points
R = the resistance
I = the current flowing through the resistance, If your circuit runs on a 9-volt battery, you already have part of the equation. You can find the specific voltage of the battery you are using by checking the packaging in which it came or doing a quick online search.


Most common cylindrical batteries (AAA through D) provide approximately 1.5 volts when fresh., You will need to know what kind of resistor is part of your circuit and how much resistance it is creating to the electricity flowing through it. Since each circuit will be different (some simple circuits may not even have resistors), you will have to investigate your circuit and locate the resistors for your unique case and their resistance in Ohms (Ω).


The wiring your electricity flows through will also have resistance. This will likely be negligible, unless the wiring is very poorly manufactured, damaged, or your circuit conducts electricity over a long distance.
The formula for resistivity is as follows: Resistance = (resistivity x length)/area, Due to the fact that battery voltage is applied to the circuit entirely, to approximate the current of your circuit you will need to divide the total voltage by each resistors resistance, with resistance being measured in Ohms (Ω). Your resulting answer will be the current (I) in amps (A), solved with the following calculation:


(V/R1) + (V/R2) + (V/R3), where V represents the total voltage and R represents a resistors resistance in Ohms."

Check big national chains.,
Look for refurbished items from regional electronics stores.,
Find manufacturer-direct outlets.",How to Find Refurbished Electronics2," For instance, North American electronics retailer Best Buy still deals in some refurbished electronics.

, Locate stores in your area, and ask if they offer deals on refurbished products. For example, the Frye’s chain in the southwest United States carries some refurbished products.

, Often, shoppers can get factory-direct refurbished goods from the electronics manufacturers’ factory outlet stores. For example, Sony operates a small number of factory outlets across the U.S. that provide a lot of deals on refurbished Sony TVs, phones, laptops, and much more. These factory outlets are a prime place for cashing in on the deals that manufacturers provide for their entire product line. Look into your country’s factory outlet locations to see if Sony or another major electronics vendor is represented.

Stay in the garden with your chao and spend a lot of time with it.,
Hatch the egg, of course!

,
Feed the newborn,it and pet it and give it chaos drives/animals to raise its stats.

,
Keep raising it(what you would do for the newborn), and it will cocoon again, and it will be a pink one instead of blue.",How to Reincarnate a Chao," This chart will show you what to do at each stage of its life:;
,,, this means that your chao has reincarnated.It will cocoon and become an adult afterwards, so here's what to do next

"
"
Get a Chao Key.,
Beat the stage.,
You should now be in the Chao Lobby.,
Enter the Chao Garden.,
Hatch the Chao eggs.,
Make the two new Chao a Hero Chao and a Dark Chao:



Hero: Use a Hero character (Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles) and constantly pet the Chao.,
Go to the Chao Kindergarten.,
Now go to the doctor and see its stats.,
You can add animal features to a Chao to change its appearance and also raise its stats at the same time.,You can give Chao Chaos Drives, but these are better than animals stat wise, as they only boost 1 particular stat.,
To have your Chao swim, get 100 skill points in swim; to walk, 50 in run.

,
Your Chao will eventually form a blue Chao-like cocoon.,
Now train your Chao in all of its stats using the animals above until you get 99 in everything (stamina not needed).,
Sit in the garden with your Chao and pet your chao for a long time.,
If done right, your Chao should eventually form a pink cocoon.,
Once the chao transforms twice, make a Chaos Chao.,
If done correctly, you should now have an immortal Chao.,
Go back to the Chao Garden.,
Put one of the eggs in the Hero and Dark Gardens.,
You can also beat all the challenge races with this chaos chao.

,
Now that you have three Chaos Chao and three normal Chao.,
Now you can get as many Chao as you want and do as you please.,
Don't forget to take care of your Chao.

",How to Raise Chao," These are found in most action stages in a blue box.;
, If you have never been to the Chao Garden, it may take a second to load.

, There are gates to the Chao Garden and the Chao Kindergarten., There should be two eggs already there.

,

To hatch eggs, you can throw them, wait, or cradle them. To do this, tilt the control stick slightly and pick up the egg. Your character will then start to cradle it. Do this for a minute and then drop the Chao and whistle. It should hatch. Repeat.
Another way to hatch an egg is to keep throwing it at a wall until it cracks, but it is not recommended.







, It should begin to turn white and blue. Once it is white and blue, with big ears and angel wings, give it 5 Hero Fruit.

Dark: Get a Dark person (Shadow, Eggman, Rouge) and constantly pet the Chao. It should become black and red. Once it is black and red, with a pointy head and devil wings, give it about 5 dark fruit.

, Bring one of your Chao and give it a name.

If you want, make the hero Chao's name God and the dark Chao Devil, as these will be the Chaos Chao).

, S is best, then A, B, C, D, and finally E, which is the worst.

, You can find these animals in many of the levels. To give a Chao an animal, just pick up the animal and walk up to the Chao.

To do the animal glitch, drop the animal directly in front of the Chao. It should receive stats, but the animal would still be there, meaning it can be used again. Keep doing this until you get the desired stats.
Certain animals only give certain stats to a Chao.

,,, This means that it is now evolving into an adult. If done right, you should have unlocked either a Hero Garden or a Dark Garden. #Put your Chao in its respective garden (e.g. Hero Chao in Hero Garden, and Dark Chao in Dark Garden). You should see another egg in those gardens., Note you can use a skeleton dog (found easily in pumpkin hill on the church mountain by the church) to have your chao wear hats or get rid of animal parts that you don't want., To do this, pet the Chao and put something like tape on the button.

Before you do this, whistle and make sure your Chao runs to you. That means your Chao is very happy.







, All of its stats will be one.

If done wrong, it will go into a gray cocoon and die. This means it wasn't happy. Repeat all the steps above until a second transformation happens.

,


Your Chao must have reincarnated at least twice. This means it must be on its third life or more.
Your Chao must have over 50 happiness. Happiness is a hidden value which runs from -100 to 100, and it is increased by caring for your Chao well. Your Chao must have had over 30 happiness to reincarnate, so you shouldn't have much trouble hitting this requirement.

Give your Chao at least one of every animal in its current life. Contrary to popular belief, you can give your Chao more than one of each animal. In other words, your Chao must have learned every animal behaviour. The animals that you have given to your Chao in its previous lives will have no effect on this.


Your Chao must be balanced, so that it would otherwise evolve into a Normal type. Your Chao must not be set to evolve into a Swim, Fly, Run, or Power type. This is how the false belief that you must give only one of each animal came about. Giving an equal amount of each animal is the easiest way to ensure this requirement, though.

If you want a Neutral Chaos Chao, otherwise known as the Light Chao, then your Chao must be of the Neutral alignment. Care for your Chao by using a mixture of Hero and Dark characters.
If you want a Hero Chaos Chao, otherwise known as the Angel Chao, then your Chao must be of the Hero alignment. Care for your Chao by using mostly Hero characters.
If you want a Dark Chaos Chao, otherwise known as the Devil Chao, then your Chao must be of the Dark alignment. Care for your Chao by using mostly Dark characters.



, You can get its stats maxed out and do what you want with it.

For the Hero Chao, beat all the Hero Races. For the Dark Chao, beat all the Dark races.







, Evolve both Chao using the steps above. Once both are evolved, give each one a Heart Fruit. Mate them twice so they have two eggs.

To make a Chao mate, find a Chao that is sitting on the ground with a circle of flowers surrounding it. Take the Chao that ate the Heart Fruit and place it next to the sitting Chao. They will go through a mating ceremony and then an egg will be created.

, Put one of the Chao into another garden for awhile. Make a chaos chao using the steps above.

A good name for this Chao might be Champ, Thunder, Light, etc.

,, The normal Chao are special because they change color when they evolve.

, Give them all names and make each one unique. Give the Hero Chaos Chao a hero ribbon, the Dark Chaos Chao a dark ribbon, and the normal Chaos Chao a challenge ribbon. The three special ones can get a beginner ribbon. The rest can have jewels from the jewel race. See below for Chao ideas.,"

Play games in both the Light and Dark Worlds.",How to Get Easy Rupees in Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past," In the second row to the left, there will be two green rocks that you can lift using your mitts. Lift the bottom rock, and a staircase is revealed! When you go down the staircase, there will be 10 pots. Each pot has a blue rupee underneath. This means that every time you come back, you can get 50 rupees. Doing this 20 times will completely fill your rupee pouch.;
, It'll reveal a hole, which you'll instantly fall through. You land in the dungeons of the castle. To your left will be a bomb-able wall. Bomb it, walk through, and lo and behold the chests of rupees. Exit through the hole at the top right, push aside a block that is blocking the northern door, and continue to go through the doorways (pull the right lever in the third room) until you end up in the church.

, Every dungeon has chests of rupees just waiting for you to find them.

, To do this, go to the southern stone entrance head in the Great Swamp. Enter it. Keep going forward until you see two levers and a bubble. Pull the right lever; did you see the dam open up? Go outside and there will be a single solitary fish flopping around in a shallow puddle. Kill enemies around you so they won't interfere and grab the fish. Now go up one screen until you see deep water. Stand off to the right side of it, turn to your left, and toss the fish in. The fish will reward you with rupees.


You can also sell the fish to the bottle salesman, but all you get is a bomb or two and about 5 rupees. Besides, it's very hard to carry a fish all the way to Kakariko Village while avoiding enemies.

, To get a golden bee, go to the east side of Lake Hylia and enter the Ice Cave. With your Pegasus Shoes, dash into one of the fairy statues. A golden bee will spring out. Catch it with your net, bottle it, and take it to the bottle salesman. Unbottle the bee in front of the salesman; he will be amazed and pay you 100 rupees for every golden bee you sell to him.

, Pots and chests with rupees will be there, and will reset every time you return.

, Not only is it fun, but it's quick as well.

, 20 rupees will spring out of most of the paintings.

, You'll be rewarded with rupees.


There's also a hidden staircase on the same mountain level. You have to use the hookshot to get from platform to platform in order to open up chests containing 50 rupees.

, As you keep hitting the sparkling object, rupees will fall in increasing value. You can get up to red rupees.

, Some require skill, such as the archery game in the Dark World, but most just require luck and chance, like the chest games in the Light and Dark Worlds. The games requiring luck and chance will give you a bigger reward, but you'll also be more prone to spending more rupees to keep playing.

Decide what kind of fighter you want to be.,
Purchase a weapon (For example a sword, axe or club) and a bow equipped with arrows, although bows can be easily substituted with long range destruction spells.,
Poison your arrows and enchant your bow, armour and weapons if they aren't already.,
Roam the countryside for a creature to slay.,
Shoot your target, twice if you can manage.,
Wait for your target to reach your location and attack them first - make sure your first hit is a power attack, which is done by holding down the attack button.

,
Block when the enemy counter-attacks.,
Strike back soon after your enemy has hit your shield whilst you were blocking as they will have been knocked back a bit, providing a perfect opening for an attack.

,
Re-poise your weapon if needed to give you the upper hand.,
Continue to attack and counter attack and poison you weapons until your opponent is dead.

",How to Fight in Oblivion," Although there are several classes to choose from, each benefiting certain types of fighting styles more than others, developing your skills will enable you to become whatever fighter you wish to be. The tutorial at the beginning will help you to decide what kind of fighting style suits you the most - be aware though, after you choose what race, class and birth sign you will be for the second time before exiting the sewers, you will not be able to change these attributes again. Fighting styles can include spell casting, using bows, swords, axes or numerous other weapons, or even no weapon at all or a mix of all. However, deciding early on what path you would like to take will help you be a better fighter later on.;
, Poison should also be bought or preferably self-created, so that you can coat your weapons with it. Spells such as fortify strength or magika are handy to have whilst fighting also.

, Poisoned weapons and enchantments are an effective combination.

, Enemies tend to be more active at night, but deep forest is usually dangerous no matter what time of day it is.

, If the enemy hasn't spotted you first, it may be advisable to sneak whilst you are shooting to give an extra attack modifier to your bow shots.

,, You may be knocked back or temporarily stunned, but usually you have enough time to block again before your opponent's next attack.

,, Try using different types of poisons depending on the situation; a heavily armed opponent can be subdued with a burden potion and a spell caster can be defeated with a silence potion, rendering them unable to cast spells.

Kill the dragon priest.,
Enter Sovngarde.",How to Enter Sovngarde in Skyrim," After completing “The Fallen” quest, the dragon named Odahviing, Alduin’s right hand, should now be trapped inside Dragonsreach in Whiterun. In order to free the dragon, simply talk to the guard located on the second level where Odahviing is held captive, and he will pull the chain, freeing the dragon.


Note that this step will also start the quest called the “World Eater’s Eyrie.”;
, Once freed, Odahviing will offer to carry you to Sovngarde. Accept his offer and you’ll be able to climb up to his back. He will then take the air and fly out of Dragonsreach.

, Odahviing will land somewhere southeast of the Skyrim map around Jerall Mountains. He will then tell you that you’ve reached Skuldafn (Alduin’s fortress) and that he can no longer take you beyond this point. After climbing off Odahviing, start walking through the large stone arches into Skuldafn Temple.

, Once inside the temple, you’ll find yourself in a room with two lock doors on both the left and right sides, and three pillars with three animal sculptures on each sides—namely, a snake, a bird, and a whale.


To solve this puzzle, simply turn the middle pillar so that its snake side is facing the door on the left of the room. Turn the other two pillars so that the side with birds are facing the same left direction too. Pull the lever on the middle of the room afterwards, and the door to the left should unlock, leading to the rest of the temple.

, After solving the first riddle, you’ll find yourself again inside another puzzle room. This time, there’s a wooden ramp on the other side that you can bring down by turning the three pillars (one in front of the door and two on the upper level on each side) inside the room.


To solve this puzzle, simply turn the pillar in front of the door so that its side with a snake is facing outside. Turn the second pillar on the second level to the right into bird, and turn the third pillar on the second level into whale. Pull the lever you see on the middle of the room, and the wooden ramp should come down, letting you pass.
You can also simply opt to jump the gap on to the other side of the room to skip solving this puzzle.

, At the end of the Skuldafn temple, you’ll find a dragon priest named Nahkriin guarding an altar. Attack the priest with whatever weapon or spell your character has and kill him. After killing Nahkriin, loot his body to obtain the Dragon Priest Staff.


The best way to kill Nahkriin is by using the pillar in the area as your cover. Equipped with your bow and arrow, simply fire arrows at Nahkriin and hide behind the pillar after every shot. The priest will only attack your character if it’s out of its cover. Keep firing shots and hiding alternately until Nahkriin is killed.

, Open your item inventory and equip the Dragon Priest Staff. Approach the altar and use the staff while standing here to activate the portal that leads to the afterlife world. Once the portal is open, jump through it and you’ll find yourself on the soil of Sovngarde.

The following are all skills you can increase over the course of the game.


Enchanting – the ability to bind magic to weapons and armor.
Alteration – makes your magic stronger for affecting the world around you, like giving yourself the ability to stay underwater longer or paralyze your enemies.
Restoration – the ability to use healing and protective magic.
Destruction – the ability to cast harmful natural spells, like fire, ice, or lightning.
Conjuration – the ability to cast spells that bind, such as Soul Trap.
Illusion – the ability to cast spells that mess with your enemies’ minds, such as fear, calming, and invisibility.
Alchemy – the ability to make potions and poisons.
Speech – the ability to get better prices when bartering and to persuade people to do what you want.
Pickpocket – the ability to get away with stealing from others without them noticing.
Lockpicking – the ability to open chests and doors without keys (there are some chests and doors that you cannot pick, but most of them are fair game).
Sneak – the ability to maneuver around Skyrim without being seen or heard.
Light Armor – lets you work better in the lighter types of armor (Hide, Leather, Elven, and Glass)
Archery – determines how accurate your shots are and how critical the hits will be.
One-handed – lets you increase the damage inflicted and agility when using one-handed weapons (daggers, swords, maces, and axes).
Two-handed – lets you increase the damage inflicted when using two-handed weapons (great swords, battle axes, and warhammers).
Block – the ability to stop an enemy’s physical attack or to ward off negative status from a strong attack (such as staggering). This does not apply to magical attacks.
Heavy Armor – lets you work better in the heavier types of armor (Iron, Steel, Dwarven, Ebony Armor)
Leather Armor – lets you work better in the lighter types of armor (Hide, Leather, Elven, Elven, Orcish, and Daedric).
Smithing – the ability to make different types of armor (both heavy and light).;
, Each of these skills has its own skill matrix from which you can choose to take your skill to a new level.


For example, the Lockpicking matrix lets you make it easier to open different skill levels of locks, starts the lock pick close to the opening position, or even makes your lock picks unbreakable.

, Opening perks helps to speed up how quickly you level up your skills. Every perk on the matrix has a required skill level before you can unlock the skill.


For example, to open the Golden Touch perk (you find more gold when you open chests), your Lockpicking skill must be at least 60.

, Every time you do, you start to level up. Sneak around to increase your Sneak skill; spend time at Alchemy Labs or Arcane Enchanter to increase your alchemy and enchanting skills. Opt to pick locks instead of using keys when you can.

, The more you use a bow and arrow, the better your Archery skill will be. If you want to simultaneously level up One-handed and a particular magical ability, you can equip a one-handed weapon in one hand and a magical spell in the other.


The more often you use a skill or equip something associated with a particular skill, the more it will level up.

, Every time you level up, you have the ability to buy a particular skill from its matrix.

, That way when your character levels up, you are more likely to have the requirements for the next level on the skill matrix.


If you want to be harder to detect but have not taken the time to sneak around towns and the wild, you may not be able to open the Muffled Movement perk, which means you will continue to be noisy when you are trying to sneak.

, For things like armor, make sure you are consistent in the type of armor you wear (avoid mixing light and heavy armor).


Take your weapon of choice into battle, and take every available opportunity to work on skills that require a particular environment (such as alchemy, enchanting, and lockpicking).

, They are all over Skyrim, but many of them are surprise finds.


For example, there is a book on Stealing in the Bleak Falls Barrow.

, This is to make sure you have read all of the available skill books. As soon as you pick up and open a books, your skill level will automatically increase.

, This is the easiest and most expensive way to increase your skill.


Don’t forget to “read” the book once you buy it because unlike finding a book, buying a book does not automatically mean you read it.

Each race has different starting stats and abilities, and knowing those will get you off to a great early start in Skyrim.
, The different races all have aspects of the game they are particularly good at. Select your race not only for what it looks like but also based on the starting skills of each race and the powers they come with upon creation. There are ten different races you can play in Skyrim., The Altmer, or High Elves, are particularly adept at Illusion magic. They start the game with a bonus to regenerate magicka (Skyrim’s version of mana), an ability to gain +50 to magicka at will, a +10 to the Illusion skill, and a +5 to Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Enchanting, and Restoration.

Obtain a Slaking.,
Give the Slaking a Choice Scarf.,
Give it a Jolly Nature.,
Work on Slaking's stats.,
Some suggested moves for a Scarf Slaking is:


Giga Impact - A powerful move that recharges afterwards.",How to Use Slaking Competitively in Pokémon X and Y1," Scarf Slaking is essentially a Slaking that is holding the Choice Scarf which dramatically ups its speeds to do some hefty damage and probably out speed the opponent with its already amazing 100 speed.;
, The Choice Scarf can be found in the Battle Maison for both X and Y. As said before, it raises the speed incredibly but of course it has its price. The Choice Scarf will up your speed in return for a singular move to be used only. For example, if you had a Garchomp with a Choice Scarf and it went for Outrage, it would most likely be faster than the opponent and land the hit. Then, Garchomp is forced to use Outrage unless it is switched out or fainted.

, It ups the Speed but lowers the Special Attack, and Slaking isn't much of it anyway.

, Since Slaking is a powerful Pokémon, give it 252 Attack, 252 Speed, and 4 HP. 252 Attack for powerful Giga Impacts, 252 Speed for you to go first, and 4 HP to help Slaking just a bit.

, Perfect for Truant.
Earthquake - Nice ground move to have.
Brick Break - To go against normal/steel types as well as breaks screens.
Sucker Punch - Always go first but only hits if the attacker is using an attacking move.
Other moves could be any of the elemental punches (Fire, Ice, Thunder Punch), or Night Slash since it has a high critical hit ratio.

, Spam iron daggers (1 dagger requires 1 iron ingot and 1 leather strip), these short blades give you the most xp, for the least money/equipment out of all create-able armor/weapons. You also don't need any perks, you'll be able to make them from the start of the game.

, You only need around 500 daggers to get to level 100 smithing from scratch, this may sound like a lot but you'll get there in around 5 hours. (including waiting for stock to resupply e.t.c...)

Façade - This moves power is doubled when the user is either paralyzed, burned, or poisoned so you can expect a 140 powered, 252 Attack and 252 Speed with Jolly Nature Slaking coming your way!",How to Use Slaking Competitively in Pokémon X and Y3," Façade Slaking will have an increased damage of Façade when it is inflicted with a status problem.

, Flame Orb is more advised. These orbs gives you the Poison or Burn status problems when held for one turn.

,,,
Bulk Up - Raises Attack and Defense by 1. Good to use when you first send Slaking out as the Flame or Toxic Orb do not activate until one complete turn. So getting the Attack raise will benefit Slaking if it is holding the Flame Orb since Burn lowers Attack.
Pursuit - If the opponent is trying to escape the power of Slaking, predict them with a Pursuit to give the Pokémon switching out lesser HP!
Double-Edge - Powerful move with 33% recoil so be wise on when to use it.

However, it has 750 gold as well as poison, enchanted equipment and grand soul gems, etc. because it's a merchant chest. This is the check known as the ""Dawnstar chest"".

, The chest belongs to a Khajiit merchant, named Ahkari. After you take what you need from the chest, go to her, save, attack her, and reload. Her inventory should be restocked with all of the gold and soul gems (the number of which is random).

Gather necessary materials first.,
Go to a Blacksmith shop and use the Forge.,
Raise your Smithing skill.,
Improve your armor’s quality by using the Workbench.,
Enchant the items.",How to Get Good Armor on Skyrim," In Skyrim, you can’t make an item out of nothing (unless you use cheats, of course). There are several types and classes of armors you can choose from, each having its own required materials. In example, to create the Daedric Armor, one of the highest level armors in the game, you need 3 Leather Strips, an Ebony Ingot, and a Daedric Heart.


Common materials can be bought from town shops (like Leather Strips and some Ingots).
Rare materials can be obtained through quests or by killing high-level monsters (such as the Daedra, which drops a Daedric Heart when killed).
The top-three most powerful armor you can get in Skyrim are as follows:

Dragon Armor—These armors can be forged using 3 Dragon Scales (from dragon remains), 2 Dragon Bones (from dragon remains), and 3 Leather Strips (can be bought from Smithing shops anywhere in the game). You also need to have a Smithing level of 100 to make this.
Daedric Armor—These armors can be forged using 3 Leather Strips (buy from Smithing shops), 5 Ebony Ingot (get from Gloombound Mine), and 1 Daedra Heart (obtained by killing a Daedra in the Shrine of Mehrunes Dagon). You also need a Smithing level of at least 90 to be able to forge this.
Ebony Armor—You’ll need 5 Ebony Ingots and 3 Leather strips to make this. You also need a Smithing level of at least 80 to be able to forge this.

;
, When you have all the required materials, go to a Blacksmith shop and use the Forge there. Forges are commonly located inside towns but can also be found on some abandoned places or inside ruins.


One Forge you can easily find early in the game is located in Whiterun. Once you’ve entered the town, head to the right and you’ll see a house and a Forge beside a creek. Approach the Forge and press the Interact button to use it.

, One of the several character attributes or skills is Smithing. This skill determines what kind of equipment you can forge. At the start of the game, you can only produce Steel-type armors, as these are the basic items. Smithing is increased every time you create an item like shields, weapons, and armors.


Leveling your Smithing skill is important because even if you have the materials required for a certain item, you won’t be able to forge one if your Smithing skill is not high enough. In example, even if you have the materials for the Daedric Armor, you won’t be able to create one if your skill hasn’t reached the Daedric Smithing level yet (Smithing level 90).

, After you create your armor using the Forge, you can take the item to a Workbench where it can be upgrade to different levels of qualities like Fine, Superior, Exquisite, Flawless, Epic, and Legendary.


To upgrade your armor, all you need are ingots or leathers, depending on the type of armor you’re improving.
Workbenches can be also be found inside towns and can be used the same way as a Forge.

, After you’ve improved the quality of your armor, you can have it enchanted. Enchanted armors have special bonuses depending on the type of spell they have, such as having more resistance against electric, fire, or ice attacks.


To enchant an item you need Filled Soul Gems (which can be bought from shops or found inside dungeons), an Arcane Enchanter (found in all major cities and inside dungeons), and a certain level of the Enchantment skill.
Just like Smithing, the quality of enchanted armors you produce depends on the level of your Enchantment skill, which can be improved by constantly creating enchanted items.

, The dagger is in pieces. First look for the hilt, as it is the easiest part to find. It is in Jorgen's and Lamis' house in Morthal. The house can be found across the bridge directly left of the lumber mill. Note that you will either need a good supply of lockpicks or the key to Jorgen's chest, as this is not an easy lock to pick. You can pickpocket the key off Jorgen while he sleeps. Make sure to save before pickpocketing. Inside the chest the hilt of Mehrunes razor and  some gold will be inside.

, These are located in a place called Cracked Tusk Keep. It is found west of the dark brotherhood sanctuary in Falkreath hold.

Once you have killed Drascula, search her body and take the pommel stone, as well as her feathers and claw to use in potions or sell.

, A courier should soon come to you telling you about a museum opening in Dawnstar. Once the courier finds you, talk to Silas Vesuvius at his house in Dawnstar. Accept the job he gives you. Give him the pieces of the razor. He will tell you to meet him at the shrine to Mehrunes Dagon.

The Black Book: Untold Legends can be found in Benkongerike in Solstheim, and choosing the Black Market power will give you the ability to summon a Dremora Merchant for 15 seconds that you can buy from and sell to. Once you reach level 47, the Black Merchant will begin selling enchanted and unenchanted Daedric equipment.


The Dremora Merchant is the only merchant not affiliated to the Thieves Guild that will sell Daedric armor and weapons to you.

, Becoming a member of the Thieves Guild and progressing through the Guild’s questline will open up fences that you can sell stolen goods to while offering a variety of equipment, consumables and crafting components. Two of these fences, Tonilia and Niranye, will occasionally stock Daedric weapons that you can buy once you hit level 47.Tonilia can be found in the Ragged Flagon, and you can begin trading with her once you complete the quest “Taking Care of Business.”She will stock up all sorts of Daedric weaponry at random.
Niranye can be found in the market district of Windhelm, and she becomes available to trade with after finishing the quest “Summerset Shadows.”She will usually stock Daedric bows, so archers will have a much easier time finding their weapons of choice with Niranye.

, If you have the Dawnguard expansion installed, you can begin encountering Revered Dragons at level 59 and Legendary Dragons at level 78. They will be really, really hard to kill if you are not properly equipped and prepared to deal with them. This means preparing potions to restore health, restore magicka, restore stamina, resist fire, resist frost and resist magic. Wearing enchanted equipment that boosts resistances against fire, frost and magic will also help you better survive their hard-hitting blows. Also, shouts like Dragonrend and Become Ethereal are particularly useful against these types of dragons as they’ll help you better survive their nasty breath attacks and Drain Vitality shouts. The fact that you can loot Daedric equipment from their bodies, however, makes killing them a particularly nice reward for the effort required.If you have trouble slaying Revered and Legendary dragons, you may find this WikiHow article on killing dragons in Skyrim very useful.

Once you’re in the area, go through the portal to enter Sovngarde.;
, Once you get to Sovngarde, walk a little along the path to find a man standing between two large dragon bones. This is Tsun, the Nordic god of trials and the one guarding the entrance to the Hall of Valor.

, Talk to Tsun and he will ask you by what right are you asking for admittance to the hall. Select “By right of birth” from the list of options prompted on the screen, and he will respond that even though you are the Dragonborn, you still need to prove your worth by defeating him in a fight.

, The Nordic god inflicts terrible damage with his axe, making him difficult to defeat in a fair fight. In order to kill him easily, right after selecting your answer, go behind Tsun and wait for him to finish talking.


Once he draws his axe, quickly attack him from behind to perform a quick kill attack and instantly defeat Tsun.

, Tsun might not cross the stream and when the lightening hits him several times then he will grant you entrance.

Choose to travel alone or in a group.,
Force your way through the Karthspire Camp.,
Clear out the opposition in Karthspire.,
Solve the first puzzle.,
Solve the second puzzle.,
Use your blood to unlock Sky Haven Temple.",How to Gain Entrance to the Sky Haven Temple in Skyrim," You will be given the choice to travel alone or travel with Delphine and Esbern to Sky Haven Temple. Traveling alone can be the faster choice, as you need only fast travel or take a carriage to Markarth, and then follow the road east. Traveling with Delphine and Esbern will take longer but will prove safer, as you will have two other companions to assist you in fending off any hostiles along the way.;
, A camp filled with Forsworn will block your way to Sky Haven Temple. If that’s not bad enough, you’ll also have to deal with a dragon that is flying around the camp. Prepare your weapons, spells, potions, and armor for a fierce fight if you choose to run head-long into the camp.If you position yourself well, you can actually set things up so that the dragon and Forsworn will fight each other. Creep close enough to the camp, and the Forsworn will start shooting arrows at the dragon, which will obligingly begin chewing up the Forsworn for you. You can then walk in and mop up the survivors after one side finishes the other off.
You can also pick off a few Forsworn by slowly advancing upon the camp, bringing out a bow and unleashing ranged sneak attacks against the Forsworn that you first come across. This also gives you the added benefit of pulling only a few Forsworn at a time, giving you a series of easy fights instead of one big rumble against the entire camp.
You don’t need to worry about Esbern and Delphine dying during the fight in the camp. They are marked as “essential” in the game, meaning they will only fall down to one knee when they run out of health but will never actually die—even when a dragon is breathing spouts of fire down their throats.You can actually skip a large portion of the fight by dashing through the camp and entering Karthspire itself. Most of the Forsworn will be busy fighting the dragon; giving you the chance to run past them and enter Karthspire itself.

, Don’t let your guard down once you enter the cave, as you will still have to face a few Forsworn as well as a tougher Forsworn Briarheart inside. If you ran through the camp and rushed straight to Karthspire, you will also have to neutralize the Forsworn that are chasing you as they will eventually enter the cave after you do.


There are a few bedrolls here, so you can rest up to recover health once you have cleared out all opposition.

, Make your way through Karthspire and you will eventually encounter the first puzzle. It involves three rotating stone pillars that you will need to rotate so that the symbol of the Dragonborn (the heart-shaped pattern) is facing you. Doing so will lower the bridge leading to the next puzzle.

, You will come across a room filled with pressure plates with symbols on top of them. At the end of the room is a chain lever, which you need to pull to lower the raised bridge and neutralize the traps. Examine the pressure plates and make your way to the chain lever by stepping only on the plates with the symbol of the Dragonborn on top of them. The Dragonborn symbols on these will be identical to the Dragonborn symbols on the pillars you encountered earlier. Pull the chain lever to lower the bridge to the next area.


This segment will be a lot easier if you use the Whirlwind Sprint Shout to bypass the plates. The Become Ethereal Shout will also negate the damage from the flames, while the Light Foot perk from the Sneak skill tree will allow you to walk over the plates without triggering them., You will find the gigantic statue of a head that Esbern will remark is in the image of Reman Cyrodiil, the Worldly God and founder of the Reman Dynasty.This area will, at first glance, appear to be a dead end, but Esbern will notice a blood seal on the floor. This seal will unlock only with the blood of a Dragonborn. Approach the seal, interact with it, and wait for your character to feed the blood seal by cutting a palm. The gigantic stone head will then retract; granting you access to the former blades headquarters of Sky Haven Temple.

Craft your own Daedric Equipment.,
Obtain a sigil stone.,
Place the sigil stone in the Atronach Forge.,
Craft unenchanted Daedric Equipment.,
Craft a random enchanted Daedric equipment.",How to Get Daedric Armor and Weapons Without Smithing in Skyrim2," If you are a mage that has the sigil stone from the quest “Conjuration Ritual Spell,” then you can craft Daedric weapons and armor using the Atronach Forge in the Midden. You will need to undertake specific steps to use the Forge to create Daedric equipment as well as obtain the necessary equipment for the process. This makes the whole process a lot complicated than simply increasing your Smithing capabilities, but it’s nonetheless a viable option for creating Daedric equipment without spending a single point on Smithing.

, Raise your Conjuration to 90, join the College of Winterhold and speak with Phinis Gestor. He will give you the “Conjuration Ritual Spell;” telling you that he needs a sigil stone. He will teach you how to summon an unbound dremora, which you will use to summon the said dremora. Summon and kill the dremora twice, and it will yield to you. Summon the dremora once more, and it will return with a sigil stone. Give the stone to Phinis Gestor, and he will use it give you a spell tome that will allow you to cast Flame Thrall before giving the stone back to you., Once you have the Sigil Stone, enter the Midden in the College of Winterhold and make your way to the Atronach Forge. Place the sigil stone in a pedestal on the Forge, and you will open up a new line of items to craft – including Daedric equipment.

, You will need a Black Soul Gem (filled or unfilled), a Centurion Dynamo Core, a Daedra Heart and the Ebony equivalent of the weapon or armor you want to craft. If you want to craft, say, a Daedric Sword, you will need an Ebony Sword to complete the recipe.Do note that crafting Daedric Boots using the Atronach forge is bugged, as it will give you a pair of inferior Dremora boots instead. This is fixed in the Unofficial Skyrim Patch version 1.2 or higher, which can be installed on PC versions of Skyrim.

, Prepare a filled Greater Soul Gem or better (Grand and Black gems count), an ebony ingot and void salts for armor or a silver sword/greatsword for weapons. This is the most efficient way to craft Daedric equipment with the Forge once you consider the commonness of the required components, although you won’t be able to control what enchantments will pop up as a result of the crafting process. These enchantments will thus cover all possible enchantments, ranging from dealing bonus fire/frost/lightning damage and banishing summoned Daedra for the weapons to fortifying your skills and increasing the damage you do with certain weapons for the armor.


Crafting random enchanted Daedric weapons is bugged, as this will only produce warhammers and war axes. This is fixed by the Unofficial Skyrim Patch version 2.0.5 or higher – again, for PC versions of Skyrim.

Get another dog.",How to Get a Dog in Skyrim," Markarth is the westernmost city in the map of Skyrim. To get there, exit the city of Whiterun and take the western road. Take the road all the way west past the town of Rorikstead. Markarth comes right after the Sky Haven Temple.;
, On the right hand side facing the Markarth city gates, you’ll find a small stable housing a few horses. Approach the stable and you’ll find a man with a dog tending the horses.

, The name of the man tending the stable is Banning. He’s a human with short dark hair wearing a brownish green tunic and a leather bracer. Approach Banning and press the corresponding “Talk” button on your game controller as prompted on the game screen to talk to him.

, Banning will ask you if you need a trained war dog. A response box will appear on the screen allowing you to choose an answer you can give to him. Select “I’ll take that dog off your hands,” and he’ll give you the dog standing next to him in exchange for 500 gold.

, Walk away from Banning and you’ll notice that the dog will start following you. It will continue to do so since you are now its owner.

, You can either tell a dog to stay and wait or go home. To give orders to the dog, approach it and press the corresponding “Talk” button on your game controller to interact with the dog. A response box will appear on the screen allowing you to choose an order you can give to it.


Select “Wait here” and the dog will sit and wait for you at the spot you told it to wait for you. It will not move no matter where you go. If you stray too far from your waiting dog and manage to lose sight of it, it will spawn back next to you once the game reloads.
To have it follow you again, approach it and press the “Talk” button on your game controller and select “Follow me” from the response box.
To send the dog back home, select “It’s time for you to go back home,” and it will start walking away from you. When you go back to one of the houses you own, like in Whiterun, you’ll find the dog inside the lodging.

, Dogs can be killed if severely damaged during combat. Don’t worry though because you can get another dog from Banning in Markarth. On the other hand, you can’t get second dog while the first one you bought is still alive.

, If you somehow lose track of Hadvar, you can use the game’s compass to find Riverwood. Open the Journal by pressing Start (on PS3 or Xbox 360), or the ESC key if you’re playing on a PC/Mac. This should bring up a list of your current quests.

It should be noted that Dawnguard is a DLC (Downloadable Content), meaning it must either be purchased online, or bought as an extended edition of the game in order for the player to be able to access any Dawnguard content. Your character must also be at least level 8 to follow the missions in the DLC.;
, Guards can be found in all major holds, and even wandering about on patrols. Simply approach one and hit the appropriate button to speak with them, and they will mention the Dawnguard


This interaction will update your quest log with the task to speak with the leader of Dawnguard. A quest marker will appear on your map, showing you where the leader is located, in Fort Dawnguard.

, Simply fast travel to a location in the southwestern corner of the map, and follow the quest marker on the compass at the top of your screen. To find Fort Dawnguard, you must first travel through the Dayspring Cave. It is embedded in a mountain face, and adorned with two torches to mark the entrance


Head inside the cave and walk through the ravine, heading straight until you reach a large pond with waterfalls flowing into it. Keep to the right, and head up the dirt path. Follow this path until you reach Fort Dawnguard. Enter the looming fortress by following the winding path up to its double doors.

, As soon as you enter the fort you will see Isran, head of the Dawnguard, talking to another member. Hit the appropriate button to interact with him. He explains the Dawnguard’s situation and mentions that they are desperately in need of more members.

, Isran will talk about investigating the castle of vampires for the Dawnguard. Agree to do this for him, and he will give you a crossbow, a weapon only accessible through the DLC, and the next quest, “Awakening,” will begin.

, After talking with Isran, your quest log will update and direct you to investigate Dimhollow Crypt. By opening up your main menu, and selecting “Awakening” as an active quest, you will have a white arrow on your compass, directing you to Dimhollow Crypt.


On your world map, Dimhollow crypt will show as a cave; it is located to the southwest of the Frostmere Crypt and to the north of The Lord Stone. If you have previously travelled to either of these two locations, simply open the world map using the appropriate button, select the location of your preference, and select the “Fast Travel” option when prompted.

, Once inside, you will overhear two vampires, accompanied by a death hound. Once they notice your presence, they will attack. Try using the crossbow given to you by the Dawnguard, as it is particularly effective against vampires.

, Continue through the crypt by entering the room across from where you encountered the vampires. Inside will be a chain you must pull to open the gate at the other side of the room.


Head back into the main room and enter the newly opened part of the crypt, where another vampire is waiting to attack you. Defeat this vampire and his skeletons, and head down the stairs on the right.
After taking care of any lingering vampires, head down the next staircase, which leads to a room with three gated doors. Each of these can be opened with their corresponding pull chains. Going from left to right, the final chain is the one that needs to be pulled to enter the next chamber.
The next chamber within the crypt is filled with corpses of frostbite spiders, as well as two live vampires that will attack on sight. Continue past this chamber until you reach a small wooden door, which leads to the Dimhollow Cavern

, Once you enter Dimhollow Cavern, you will hear the vampire Lokil interrogating Vigilant Adalvald, who is killed before revealing anything. After Adalvald is killed, Lokil, his thrall, and another vampire will attack you on sight. The thralls are fairly weak and can be easily defeated by using fire spells or arrows. However, Lokil is a bit stronger. He still shares the universal vampire weakness of fire, so use a fire-enchanted weapon or the fireball spell to win in a matter of minutes.

, Once you have successfully defeated Lokil and his underlings, approach the circular pillar located in the center of the chamber. Once you are standing over it, hit the appropriate button. A spike will emerge and prick your hand as a bright purple light emanates from the floor.

, Push each of the braziers in the appropriate direction so that they touch the end of the purple light within their path. Once you have a brazier properly placed, the purple light will extend to the next one. Simply connect the braziers via the purple light to solve the puzzle.

, Once they are all connected, the center of the structure will lower, revealing a woman carrying an Elder Scroll. She introduces herself as a vampire named Serana and requests that you take her to Castle Volkihar, her family home. Serana will become your new companion and will follow you out of the cave.

, After freeing Serana, exit the crypt by crossing the stone bridge on the opposite side of the room. Head up to the door on the right, and enter a small chamber. Finally, head through the gate, which leads into an amphitheater with many undead creatures lurking around. After defeating them, head out through the gated door at the opposite end of the room. Once you leave, the quest will be completed.

, Once you and Serana have safely escaped the crypt, it is time to journey to the home of the vampire lords. After completing the “Awakening” quest, a new quest called “Bloodline” will be added to your quest menu. Making it your active quest will give you a white arrow to follow on your compass.

, Castle Volkihar is located in the most northwestern corner of the map. The best way to journey there is to take a boat at the Icewater Jetty. To reach the Icewater Jetty, ask a ferryman to take you to this location. Ferrymen can be found on the docks of Dawnstar, Solitude, and Windhelm. As these three locations are major points of interest on the map, you can easily fast travel to them via the world map. The trip will cost 500 gold. Once you arrive on the dock, step onto the large boat, and hit the appropriate prompt button to be taken to the castle.

, Once you step off the boat, follow the hill path to the cobblestone steps up the castle. The watchman will immediately open the gates once he sees Serana. Upon your arrival, there will be a bit of commotion as Lord Harkon, head of the castle, reunites with his daughter. After exchanging pleasantries, Lord Harkon will address you, thanking you for bringing back his daughter.


Lord Harkon will give you an ultimatum: stay with the Dawnguard but be forbidden to ever enter the castle again, or become a Volkihar vampire.

, If you choose to become a vampire, Lord Harkon will bite you, and the screen will fade to black. When you come to, you and Lord Harkon will be in the Volkihar Cathedral, where he will teach you how to use your newfound powers.


If you were a werewolf previously, you will lose your lycanthrope powers to become a vampire.

Kill the dragon priest.,
Retrieve the staff.,
Return to Winterhold.",How to Find the Staff of Magnus in Skyrim," After defending Winterhold in the “Containment” quest, you will need to talk to a female master wizard named Mirabelle Ervine inside the college. She will then tell you that you need to find the Staff of Magnus in order to stop Ancano from destroying the city.


She will also tell you that the staff can be found in a ruined city called Labyrinthian somewhere in Skyrim.;
, Head to the city of Morthal and take the road that lies south of it. Travel east on this road and keep on walking along this course until the path splits in two.


Take the path on the right that leads to the south. Stick on this small road, and you’ll be able to come across the entrance to the Labyrinthian, an ancient city in ruins.

, Enter Labyrinthian through the biggest door you’ll see among the ruins and make your way to its third level, called the Labyrinthian Tribune. Inside this chamber you’ll find a dragon priest called Morokei that’s wielding a weapon called the Staff of Magnus.


Range weapons like bow and arrows, and magic spells are very effective against Morokei. Close combat attacks using swords or axes can damage the priest too but will not be as effective. Also, avoid the shock spells that he’ll cast at you as these will deal severe damage on you.

, Dragon priests will turn into ashes when killed. Once Morokei is defeated, approach and search Morokei’s ashes to retrieve the Staff of Magnus.

, After killing Morokei, take the hallway on the left side of the Labyrinthian Tribune and keep following it until you reach its end. There you’ll find a door that leads back to the outside world. Exit through this door and head back to Winterhold taking the northeastern road from where you are.


You can then choose to go back to Winterhold and speak to Mirabelle to complete the quest, or go someplace else and just finish it later.

If you have the base version of Skyrim, you can purchase the expansion from your platform's online store. This will automatically install it for your game.;
, Being Level 10 or above is the easiest way to start the Dawnguard quest. Your level can be raised by increasing your skill levels. Each time you raise your skill level, you'll gain some experience points towards your character level.

See Level Up Fast in Skyrim for tips on gaining levels quickly.
You don't need to be Level 10 to start the Dawnguard quest, but it makes it much easier.

, Town guards may relay a rumor about the Dawnguard, revealing the location on your map. This is not guaranteed to happen, but you can increase your chances by talking to as many guards as possible.

If you manage to hear the rumor, the location of Fort Dawnguard will appear on your map, and the Dawnguard quest will appear in your journal.

, After you reach Level 10, the orc Durak will seek you out as you enter or exit any building in a town. This is the most surefire way to start the quest.

Durak will approach you even if you've already heard about Fort Dawnguard from a town guard.

, Durak will mark the location of the fort on your map if you haven't heard it from a guard yet, and the quest will be added to your journal.If you decline his request to seek out Dawnguard, you can talk to him again and tell him your interested. He'll stay in his current location until you agree.

, If all else fails, you'll be able to force the quest to start by finding Dayspring Canyon and talking to Agmaer there. See the next section for details., Riften is the nearest landmark to Dayspring Canyon, the entrance to Fort Dawnguard. You most likely already have Riften on your map, but if you don't it can be found in the southeast corner of the map, on the east side of the lake.If you've previously been to Riften, you can fast travel to it from your map to make the journey quick and easy.

, The entrance to Dayspring Canyon is a short distance from Riften's east entrance., You'll cross a small bridge soon after you take the path to the southeast. There may be some wolves nearby that will try to attack., A few steps after crossing the bridge, start looking at the cliff wall to your left. The entrance to Dayspring Canyon appears as a crack in this wall between a hollow log and a birch tree that's been broken., This will load a new area, where you'll be able to find Fort Dawnguard., The path will wind through a rocky area for a few minutes before you reach the fort., If you see Durak along the path, he'll give you a new crossbow after talking to him. Agmaer is another new recruit, and will provide you with the Dawnguard quest if you somehow managed to make it here without starting it., You'll find the fort at the end of the path. Continue around the fort and up the incline to find the entrance., You'll find Isran in the center of the main room as soon as you enter the fort., He'll appreciate your enthusiasm, but he'll need you to complete some tasks before the order is ready to be joined., You're tasked with finding what the vampires were after in the cave, and to kill any that may still be there. Tolan tells you that he'll meet you there to help.

Dimhollow Crypt is in the mountains of the Dawnstar to the north. You'll find it near Frostmere Crypt if you had previously visited that location.

, You'll encounter multiple vampires, hounds, and skeletons, as well as a frostbite spider., At the end of the crypt, you'll free Serana, who will ask you to take her to her ancestral home. This will start the next quest in the series., After freeing Serana, you'll have to fight some gargoyles, draugr, skeletons, and undead as you make your way out of the crypt.

Make sure to use the Word Wall and grab any loot that you want on your way out.

, This is the closest location to Castle Volkihar, where Serana wants you to take her. Icewater Jetty is in the far northwest corner, near Northwatch Keep., You can take a boat from Icewater Jetty that will transport you to Castle Volkihar, which is on an island in the northern ocean., Lord Harkon will offer to turn you into a Vampire Lord, which will activate the Vampire Lord portion of the DLC quests and lock your out of joining the Dawnguard. Decline his offer and you'll be shown out of Castle Volkihar, and told never to return.

You can still become a Vampire Lord later on in the Dawnguard questline.

, Once you've declined Lord Harkon's offer, make your way back to Fort Dawnguard. You'll find it under attack by vampires, which you'll need to help repel., After fighting off the attacking vampires, you can speak with Isran and you'll be officially entered into the Dawnguard. Your next few quests will get teh Dawnguard Fort restocked and filled with recruits."

, Inside you’ll find several mages walking around; they will attack you once they see you. Kill these enemies, and from the entrance, make your way to the third chamber in the area to find the prison cells where Orthorn is locked inside.

, He’s imprisoned in the center cell, and you can talk to him through the bars. Once you get close enough to him, press the “Interaction” button on your controller (displayed on the game screen) to talk to him. He’ll tell you all about the books he stole and that he’s willing to help you.

This is the city of Winterhold.;
, As you enter Winterhold, you’ll see from a distance a large castle-like structure sitting on top of a plateau detached from the city. This is the College of Winterhold. Head towards this structure and you’ll find a stone staircase at the end of the city.

, Climb the stone staircase and you’ll find a female mage guarding the bridge that connects the city to the plateau where the College rests. Speak to her and she’ll tell you that you need to pass a test in order to join the college and pass through the bridge.

Do general quests.,
Do guild quests.,
Fight in the faction wars.,
Be a completionist.,
Kill every monster.,
Go back to previous dungeons.,
Join groups.,
Join guilds.",How to Make Money in Elder Scrolls Online1," General quests, picked up from NPCs across Tamriel, will provide hard cash as a reward for completion. Some will be quick and easy (and worth little) and some will be long and involved (and the rewards usually greater).;
, The guilds of previous games make a return, and it's back to business as usual. Complete quests to get rewards, including money.

, Of course, the major point of the game is to play with other people. The main way this is done is in PvP, in the war between the factions that makes up the bulk of the story to the game. Participate in battles to gain not only experience, but also monetary rewards.

, When you do a quest, try to do everything. Take every side route and try to take the options that will lead to the most money. Sometimes quests can be cut off earlier if you make the wrong decisions in dialogues.

, It might be easier to run away from enemy beasts when traveling through the fields or exploring a dungeon, but you’re also missing a lot of loot that you could sell for gold. Destroy every beast and monster that comes in your way; some drop items that can be sold for a considerable price while others drop Gold itself when killed., After making some progress in the game, you may want to go back to previous levels or dungeons that you have completed. It will be much easier for you to explore it and allowing you to take whatever items you may have forgotten to pick or treasure boxes you’ve missed to open while you were focused on completing it the first time around., There are strong enemies that you simply cannot take down on your own, and these kinds of monsters are the ones that drop the rarest items. Team up with other players and explore deep dungeons to fight stronger monsters. Rare items sell for a lot of money, not only to NPC vendors, but especially to other players who have the cash to spend. You can join groups as early in the game as you can, so you can start early in making gold., Guild members have the privilege to buy items from Guild Stores that offer merchandise not available to usual NPC vendors. You can take advantage of this by buying items from the Guild Store and selling it to players that aren’t a member of any.

Just like joining groups, you can join the guild even at the very beginning of the game, but some guilds may require a minimum character level to join. You may talk to any member of the guild you’re looking forward to join to ask if there’s a minimum level requirement.

Become a weaponsmith.,
Become an armorsmith.,
Become an enchanter.,
Become an alchemist.,
Become a provisioner.,
Fish.",How to Make Money in Elder Scrolls Online2," One way to make money in the game is to take advantage of the game's professions system, where crafting skills can be honed into money-making opportunities.One such profession is a weaponsmith . In this profession, you make weapons of all types from found items and sell them. This can be very profitable.

, Like the weaponsmith, an armorsmith creates items to be sold. However, instead of weapons to be sold, an armorsmith makes armor (I bet you already figured that out, though). Both of these job tracks are especially helpful for Dragon Knights and other armor-reliant classes, as making your own armor and weapons can make you money by saving you money, in addition to the money you make from selling stuff you don't need.

, Enchanters are those with the magical gift to bind spells to items. All sorts of items can be enchanted, from armor to jewelry. In the Elder Scrolls universe, enchanting works by trapping souls in gems, and then using those gems to power the spell on an item, so you'll need to be capable of killing higher level creatures if you want to enchant more powerful (and thus more expensive) items.

, Alchemists make potions from ingredients they find or purchase. This may be one of the more profitable professions, once your skills are high, as alchemical ingredients are easily found and turned into potions.

, A provisioner makes food and other supplies in the game, which have effects similar to potions. Food ingredients and wood, like alchemical ingredients, are fairly easy to find.

, In true MMO fashion, you can go fishing in the game! Basic bait is easy to find, but the better the bait, the better the catch! Or, at least, certain types of bait attract certain types of fish."
"
Search everything.,
Do quests.,
Explore the world.,
Don't dismiss small items.",How to Make Money in Elder Scrolls Online3," Whenever you go anywhere in the game, search all chests, baskets, sacks, and other containers and loot everything. Take it all. Be thorough in your searching and leave no path unexplored when you go through an area. This thoroughness is the main key to making lots of money in any RPG.


There literally are thousands of treasure boxes, vases, and jars all throughout the game map. Items are randomly placed inside, which means there’s a chance of getting rare items. Break open every treasure box you see inside buildings, caves, and dungeons and take any item you see inside.

, Doing quests will also get you loot which you will often sell. Many times the monetary reward for a quest will be minimal, but you will also get a nice item. You can of course keep the item, but it may make more sense to sell it. If you don't really need it, consider the item as loot and sell it off.

, Exploring not only the cities but also the surrounding environments will give you a huge chunk of cash. This is accomplished by ""looting"" the environment, taking every available resource and alchemical ingredient and selling it later. You will also, of course, find many quests this way and other opportunities to make money.

, Another major key to making a lot of money is to not be dismissive of small transactions. You will find lots of items in the game that are worth very little, but over time you can make a great deal of money by selling them all off.


It doesn’t matter whether it was dropped by a monster or thrown away by another player, when you see stuff lying around, pick it up and add it to your inventory. These items may be small in value but when sold collectively to a vendor, it can bring a pretty hefty price tag.

Sell items.",How to Make Money in Elder Scrolls Online4," Design your main character to kill, kill, kill. Have it loot and gather everything, but craft nothing except provisions. Have it take the two ""Chef"" skills to maximize its Provisioning output, which it sells for cash. Take only those skills that help your main character kill.


Have your main character carry all Provisioning ingredients, cook them at any cook fires found, and sell whatever the main character doesn't need.

, Put everything in your bank that your main character gathers (not including items that they will use to craft into Provisions or needs to equip).

, Create additional characters specifically to craft: an alchemist/enchanter, enchanter/woodworker, woodworker/clothier, clothier/smith. Skip whichever crafts your killing character needs least (e.g., no smith for mages, no clothier for tanks).

, Have the crafting characters withdraw their relevant materials from the bank (reagents to alchemists, etc.), and store them in their own inventories, to keep the bank slots available.

, Have the crafting characters research, disassemble, create, etc. all craft-appropriate items.

, Have the crafter of an item stick it in the bank, for another character of the same craft to withdraw and disassemble. You earn more inspiration points from disassembling someone else's products than you do from disassembling something you made yourself, so this is the best way to increase your skills in order to make higher quality items.

, Once you can make items of reasonable quality. Distribute them to your main character for that character to sell. You can also trade with other players for items that you need."

, As you become more familiar with the game, you will be able to look at those symbols and understand them without having to open your maps.


When you first start, the only one that is very clear is the white down-pointing arrow that indicates your main quest.
If you’ve set a secondary quest location, it will show as blue on the bar. This will help you to maneuver to your quest without having to open the maps.

, Like the local and world maps, this bar shows you everywhere you have either been or been told about, as well as all of Skyrim’s major cities within easy traveling distance.


For example, if you are in Whiterun, it will not show you the direction to Solitude because that is too far away, unless you set it as your destination from the world map.

, Open your in-game menu and select “Magic.” Choose “Conjuration” from the menu panel on the right-hand side of the game screen, and select “Conjure Werebear.” A werebear will instantly appear near you and will stay there for 60 seconds.

Start the “Blindsighted” quest.,
Talk to Karliah.,
Find Mercer Frey.,
Reveal Mercer Frey.,
Kill Mercer Frey.,
Leave Irkngthand.,
Complete the quest.",How to Retrieve the Eyes of the Falmer Quest in Skyrim," It’s the third from the final quest of the Thieves Guild storyline. After completing the “Trinity Restored” quest (where you become one of the “Nightingales” of the guild), travel to Irkngthand and talk to Karliah.


To get to Irkngthand, travel to Windhelm (the easternmost city on the map) and exit the city through its western gates. Travel west off the road for a few miles until you come across a river.
Cross the river and continue for a few more miles, which will lead you to an old abandoned dwarven ruins. This is Irkngthand.;
, Enter the ruins through the front entrance. Once you are inside, turn right and follow the path across three more rooms to find Karliah and Brynjolf. Speak with Karliah, and she will tell you that you need to stop a man named Mercer Frey from taking the “Eyes.”

, Continue to the next room and you’ll eventually spot the man you’re looking for. A short cut scene will play. Once the cut scene is through, follow wherever Mercer went until he leads you to the last room of the ruins.

, Once you enter the last room of the ruins, a short cut scene will play again showing Mercer taking some gem off the face of an elf statue. After taking the gems, he will make a short speech and he will then use the “Invisibility” spell and vanish.


By this stage of the game, you should already have learned the “Detect Life” spell, which allows you to see the life force of other characters. Open your Spell list form the in-game menu and choose “Detect Life” to reveal where Mercer Frey is.
If you somehow manage to make it this far without learning Detect Life, you can just simply buy a “Scroll of Detect Life” (which has the same effect as the spell) from any mage merchants in any city in Skyrim before you go to Irkngthand. Open your item inventory, and choose the “Scroll of Detect Life” to use it and reveal Mercer Frey.

, After revealing where he is, attack Mercer with whatever weapon or spell you frequently use to fight enemies until he dies. After he’s dead, approach his body and press the “Search” button on your controller to retrieve the Eyes of the Falmer from his body.

, The chamber will start filling up with water right after you get the eyes. When the water goes high enough, a rock will fall off the head of the elf statue where Mercer removed the gems, revealing a path. Follow this path that leads to a cave, which leads to the outside world.

, Speak with Karliah once you’re outside again to mark the quest of retrieving the Eyes of the Falmer as completed.

Travel to Dragon Bridge.,
Enter the outpost.,
Locate the travel schedule.,
Take the schedule by force.,
Wait for an opportunity.,
Use Invisibility.",How to Steal Gaius Maro's Travel Schedule in Skyrim," If you have not yet found this location, speak to a carriage driver in any major town and pay 20 septims to fast-travel to Solitude. Follow the road southwest of Solitude and stick to the general direction of your quest marker.;
, Upon arriving at Dragon Bridge, you will find Commander Maro and his son Gauis Maro engaged in conversation outside the Penitus Oculatus outpost. You can listen in on their conversation or you can ignore them and enter the outpost right away.


You can enter the outpost without incurring a bounty if you do so while the doors are unlocked. If the doors are locked and you force your way in by picking the lock, chances are you will be spotted by a nearby NPC or by the agents inside the outpost once you enter. Your entrance will then be considered a crime and you will have a bounty set on your head.

, The schedule is atop a table immediately to your right upon entering the outpost. You will know it is the schedule by moving close enough for a tooltip to pop up on your screen., There are 3 ways to stealing the schedule, and the fastest way is to simply take it off the table by neutralizing the nearby agents. You can force the issue by slaughtering them all with whatever weapons or spells you normally use, but you will have to deal with the resulting bounty for taking the violent route.


If you want to remove your bounty, sheathe and unsheathe your weapons until the guards talk to you. You can either pay off your bounty or go to jail and lose the progress you’ve built up for leveling your skills. Both options will result in all your stolen items being confiscated by the guards in Solitude and placed in the evidence locker located in Castle Dour.If you have completed the Thieves Guild city influence quest for Solitude “The Dainty Sload,” you can pay off a guard for half your bounty while still keeping your stolen goods., The second method you can use if you are patient: you can wait until you can steal the schedule without anyone seeing you do so. There are times when only one or two awake guards will be inside the outpost. Wait until there are no guards inside the outpost, or there is only one guard who has his back to you. Sneak and quickly pick up the schedule before anyone sees you doing the deed.


You will know that nobody in the outpost can see you when the “eye” on your screen is fully closed. If you are sneaking and someone can see you, this eye will open up and the words “Detected” will appear on your screen.
You can also quickly dispatch a single agent with a sneak attack while the other agents are asleep. The perks “Backstab” and “Assassin’s Blade” grant a hefty bonus to sneak attack damage. Combine these perks with a quality sword or dagger along with Shrouded or Ancient Shrouded gloves to double your total backstab damage, and you will often do enough damage to silently kill a lone Penitus Oculatus agent without waking up the others. You will then be free to steal the schedule without anyone watching. Just make sure you get out of the outpost before any of the guards wake up and find the body., The third, and quickest, way to steal the schedule without much fuss is to go invisible, sneak, and pick the schedule up. You can go invisible by casting the Invisibility spell, drinking a store-bought invisibility potion, or drinking an invisibility potion that you brewed yourself.Once invisible, simply grab the schedule and go on your merry way. This will break invisibility but will not incur a bounty nor draw aggression from nearby NPCs for doing so.


You can create your own invisibility potions by using an Alchemy Table and combining Luna Moth Wings, Chaurus Eggs, or Ice Wraith Teeth together. You don’t need a long-lasting potion to steal the schedule, as a few seconds are all you need to steal it.

There are plenty of chests and barrels around your home to infinitely store stuff.
There are some safe places in towns (like Whiterun) where you can safely store your stuff, but it is best not to get into the habit. Start storing stuff in homes as soon as you get a home. You can fast travel close to every home you can buy, making stowing loot a little easier.;
, The risky way is to leave your loot in areas that you don’t own, like camps and caves. These items will disappear over time, so if you store them you will want it to be temporary. Come back quickly to collect the items before they disappear.

, If you want to put a particular weapon on display, arm yourself with it before moving to the next step.

, This could be empty plaques on the wall, weapon racks, or mannequins.

, Select the appropriate button of the console you’re using to interact with an object.

, Weapons will automatically be traded out since you selected it before interacting with the object.


The above steps can only be done in homes you own.

, You can store loot in the following objects:


Furniture
Barrels
Knapsacks and satchels
Chests
Bookcases have limited storage capacity, but everything else is basically unlimited space.

, Select the appropriate button of the console you’re using to open the inventory.

, Go through your inventory and leave everything you want to store within the object.

, Select the appropriate button of the console you’re using to open the inventory.

, Options will appear.

, To do this, choose “Drop” from the options.

,


These steps are best done in the safety of your home.

, Increasing your stamina level when you level up increases how much you can carry (+5 for every level up).

, Enchanting armor can increase what you can carry as long as you are wearing that particular piece of armor.

, Using Alchemy or potions you find over the world gives you a temporary boost in your carry weight.


There are several potions in the game that you can use to increase your carrying capacity, as well as the ability to use Alchemy to make the Potion of Fortify Carry Weight.
These potions give you different durations for use and different amounts of additional weight over your current carrying capacity. Read them carefully to see how much extra you can haul out of dungeons, caves, and other locations.

Start the quest “Under Saarthal.” This quest will automatically be given to you as you go through the College of Winterhold main quests.,
Find Saarthal.,
Enter Saarthal.,
Receive your assignment.,
Find and assist Arniel Gane.,
Pick up the Saarthal amulet.,
Escape the trap.,
Meet the Psijic.,
Solve the first pillar puzzle.,
Solve the second pillar puzzle.,
Defeat Jyrik Gauldurson.",How to Use the Saarthal Amulet in Skyrim," It will come immediately after “First Lessons,” where Mirabelle Irvine tours you around the college and Tolfdir teaches you how to use a basic ward spell. Tolfdir will then instruct you and the other students to meet him near the ancient crypt of Saarthal., Once you have started the “Under Saarthal” quest, the next thing you need to do is actually get to Saarthal. The crypt is directly southwest of Winterhold, and is easily reached by following the road south of Winterhold and swerving west when you see a clear snow-filled pass between the mountains.


Watch out for snow bears, ice wolves, and snowy sabre cats on the way to Saarthal. They can be hard to spot, especially if it is snowing heavily.
Do note that Saarthal’s dungeon entrance will be locked if you have not gone through the “Under Saarthal” quest. The entrance cannot be picked, and the only way to enter it is when Tolfdir opens it up to you as the quest progresses.

, Once you reach Saarthal, you will find Tolfdir and your fellow students standing outside the main entrance. Talk to him, tell him you’re ready, wait for him to speak to the others, and follow him inside.


Make sure you have a few torches or the Candlelight spell ready before descending into Saarthal. The dungeon will be somewhat dark, and these sources of light will help you find the items that you need to get through the dungeon.

, Tolfdir will continue his lecture on Nordic history as you and your fellow students descend into Saarthal. He will eventually get around to assigning tasks to your fellow students. Once he gets through with them, he will then turn to you and assign you to assist Arniel Gane.

, Simply follow the quest marker leading to Arniel, and you will eventually find him in a chamber fussing over his research. Talk to him, and he will instruct you to find a few artifacts. New quest markers will appear, and they will lead you to various artifacts within Saarthal, including the Saarthal amulet.


Look carefully at all the objects, and make sure to pick up the rings before picking up the amulet. These enchanted rings are not essential to finishing the quest, but they will give you a bonus to health when equipped or can be sold for a tidy sum if you do not need them. If you pick up the amulet before the rings though, the quest markers for those rings will disappear, making them much harder to find considering their small size and relative darkness of the dungeon.

, The amulet itself is on a bust located in a carved-out niche on a wall. Picking up the amulet will cause spikes to appear from the wall and lock you inside the alcove where you found the amulet. Tolfdir will rush to your side and suggest that the amulet may have something to do with your predicament.


Equipping the Saarthal amulet will reduce the costs of all your spells by 3%. You cannot disenchant this effect from the spell, but it can help reduce casting costs when stacked with the Diadem of the Savant (less 5%) and the Archmage’s Robes (less 15%), Access your inventory, open the Apparel tab, and equip the Saarthal amulet. Doing so will allow you to see a magical ripple in one of the nearby walls. Tolfdir will make a comment wondering if your spells might have an effect on the ripple. Now equip any targetable spell and cast it on the ripple. Doing so will reveal a hidden passageway leading to a previously untouched burial chamber.


Any spell or shout will work on the ripple, including the basic “Flames” spell that you start out with.

, Follow the newly revealed passageway and you will reach a burial chamber. Tolfdir will appear at your side, and time will stop as the Psijic named Nerien appears and gives you a dire warning. Draugr will break out of the nearby sarcophagi once you finish discussing this strange experience with Tolfdir. Slay them, and continue onwards.

, The dungeon is relatively straightforward, but you will eventually encounter two puzzles involving rotating pillars. The first puzzle is relatively easy, as all you need to do is match the animals on the pillars to the animals hidden behind each pillar. Use a torch or the Candlelight spell to have an easier time finding these symbols.

, This second puzzle is a bit trickier as rotating three of the four pillars will also rotate other pillars. To solve the puzzle, start by orienting yourself. Face the locked gate and step back until you see all four pillars in front of you. You should have two pillars on your left and two pillars on your right with the lever in between them all. Take note of the four animal symbols etched into the wall prior to reaching the rotating puzzles. You should see a snake on the first symbol to your left, a whale on the first symbol to your right, another whale on the second symbol to your left and an eagle on the second symbol to your right.
Save your game before rotating any of the pillars. This will make it easier to rotate them in order without wasting too much time.
Approach the left pillar nearest the locked gate and mentally note this pillar as “one.” Rotating “pillar one” will also rotate all the other pillars in the room. Turn it so that it reveals a fish. Go back to your starting position and reorient yourself.
Now approach the closest pillar to your left. Mentally note this pillar as “two.” Rotating this pillar also rotates the two other pillars on your right. Turn it so that it reveals a snake. Reorient yourself.
Approach the right pillar nearest the locked gate. Mentally note this pillar as “three.” Rotating this pillar will cause the other right pillar to rotate. Rotate “pillar three” so that it shows the eagle. Reorient yourself once more.
The pillar to your immediate right will rotate no other pillar. Mentally note this pillar as “four” and rotate it to show the whale. If you have done this correctly, pulling the lever should open the way forward. If it didn’t work, reload your earlier save and start from the top.

, Once you reach the end of Saarthal, you will spot a gigantic glowing orb. Tolfdir will make a remark about the orb and will awaken a particularly powerful draugr by the name of Jyrik Gauldurson. You will be unable to damage Gauldurson until Tolfdir turns his attention to the orb and strikes it with lightning. This will make the draugr vulnerable and will allow you to kill it, which will allow you to leave the dungeon and move on to the next step of the College of Winterhold quest line.


Jyrik Gauldurson will cast an elemental shield that rotates every now and then. Take note of whatever element cloaks him—fire, ice, or lightning—and avoid casting spells of that element until he switches elemental shields.
Be sure to loot Jyrik Gauldurson’s corpse to pick up the Gauldur Amulet Fragment as well as the Writ of Sealing. Reading the latter will open up the “Forbidden Legend” quest if you haven’t started it already.
Make sure to pick up the Staff of Jyrik Gauldurson as well. It is located on the table in front of Jyrik Gauldurson’s throne and is useful for inflicting damage while simultaneously damaging the target’s Magicka."

Transform into a werewolf once more.,
Wipe out the Silver Hand.",How to Wipe Out the Silver Hand in Skyrim," Right after finishing the “Proving Honor” quest, travel back to the Jorrvaskr—the easternmost hall in Whiterun—and talk to Skjor, one of the leaders of the Companions. Ask him for a job and he will tell you to meet him in the Underforge at night.;
, Wait for night to arrive. Take the path on the left side of the Jorrvaskr leading you to a secret opening on the stone wall leading to the Underforge. Go through the secret opening and inside you should find Aela (a female companion) and Skjor.

, Aela will transform into a werewolf and Skjor will cut her arm and pour her blood on the fountain in the middle of the room. Move towards the fountain and press the Activate button on your controller to make your character drink the spilled blood.

, The game screen will blacken out right after your character drinks the blood from the fountain. The next scene will show your character standing outside Whiterun, now in werewolf or “beast” form.


Run around the city to see how it’s like to become a werewolf. After a few seconds the screen will turn dark again and the next scene will be your character now back in its normal form.

, Speak with Aela once you become human again, and she will tell you that you need to wipe out a group of werewolf hunters called the Silver Hand in a place called Gallows Rock.


Leave Whiterun and head straight east past the Valtheim Towers. You’ll find a small encampment with a torn-down watchtower in the middle. This is Gallows Rock.

, Move towards the entrance you see on the encampment and pull down the chain next to it to open the way into Gallows Rock.


Open your in-game menu and select “Magic.” Choose “Powers” from the menu panel on the right-hand side of the game screen, and select “Beast Form” to turn your main character into a werewolf.

, There’s no special way you need to follow to eliminate all the Silver Hand members; simply hack and slash every person that attacks you until you kill everyone in the encampment.


Remember though that you need to exterminate all the Silver Hand while in Werewolf form.

Come up with a basic idea.,
Figure out the major details.,
Bring the character to life.,
Create your character in-game.,
Make decisions the way your character would.",How to Roleplay in Skyrim," Before you actually create your character, you should have an idea of what you want to do. Do you want to play a mage who came to Skyrim for the College of Winterhold, or an easygoing hunter who lives off the land? Think of what you enjoy doing in the game, and try to combine that with things you haven't done before.;
, What views does your character have on events in the game, such as the main quest or the civil war? Are they kind or cruel? What race are they? What do they do for a living? Why are they in Skyrim? Depending on your race, take into consideration their views on other races, cultures, and environments. For example, if you are a dark elf (dunmer) think about how your character views the cold, compared to his homeland of fire and ash.

, Give them a motivation, a reason for everything they do. Make up their past, their family, their childhood - things that will affect their actions in the present. Add little details like phobias or odd things they do. This is one of the most important steps. Come up with a reason for why they are where/how they are when the game starts.

, In Skyrim, design your character's physical appearance as you see fit. Give them a name - you may want to choose a name that makes sense for their race, but any name you like will do - and start playing.

, Don't just take every quest or make decisions you would make if you were in the same situation - this is not you, this is your character. Try to see the world from their perspective and do things the way they would. Also, when you do take quests, try to complete the quest the way your character would. Maybe, instead of slaying every living thing in a dungeon, your character will sneak past and loot all the items while they aren't looking. Skyrim is a huge game and there are many ways to play.

Fight on a horse.,
Dismount.",How to Ride Horses in Skyrim," Buying a horse requires a considerable amount of coin, at least at the beginning of the game. If you have been increasing your Speech skill, it may not be as expensive, but it is still going to cost you.


You can buy horses in stables outside all major cities.;
, Stealing a horse can be easier, depending on when and where you do it. If you steal a horse out in the wilds, the people you steal from will have a much harder time tracking you down than if you do it near a city.


To steal a horse, just mount any horse you find.

, Some stable owners will allow you to borrow horses once you befriend them. Try the following stables:


Riften stables—you can borrow a horse by winning a brawl with Hofgrir, or by erasing Shadr’s debt with Sapphire.
Katla’s Farm in Solitude. If you help Katla harvest her crops, she’ll allow you to borrow a horse.

, Walk up to the horse. Interact with it and you will climb up on its back.

, Move the horse the same way you would if you were walking. The directional buttons and putting on speed are the same for a horse as they are for your character

, Unsheathe your weapon if you want to fight on horseback. You cannot use magic when you are riding a horse. You can choose which side to come at your enemy and then strike accordingly.


You can also make your horse rear up on its back legs.

Complete the “Dampened Spirits” quest.",How to Poison the Honningbrew Vat in Skyrim," This is the fourth quest as a member of the thieves guild, right after “Loud and Clear.” To start the quest, go talk to Brynjolf, who can be found in the marketplace of Riften during the day. He will direct you to Maven Black-Briar.;
, During the day, you can find her on the second floor of the Bee and the Barb or, during the night, her manor (both in Riften). The manor, however, will be locked, so conversing with her after breaking in would cause the guards to attack you.

, After finding her in either the Bee and Barb or the manor, Maven will want you to sabotage her competition, the Honningbrew Meadery, and direct you to meet a man named Mallus Maccius at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun.

, Since you have already been there, just fast travel to Whiterun. Do this by opening up the map and selecting the icon that looks like a horse on a shield as your destination.

, The Bannered Mare is a bar located in the shopping area of Whiterun, simply head north from the entrance gates until you reach a large building with a sign of a bucking horse on its front.


Enter the bar, then head straight until you see a small hall on the left side of the main room . This hall leads to a smaller room with a fireplace; Mallus will be seated at one of the tables.

, Hit the appropriate button to interact with Mallus, and tell him that Maven sent you. He’ll tell you the plan is to poison the competitor’s batch of mead. You will be prompted to ask if he has the poison.


Throughout the conversation, you will be prompted to select dialog options, but you only receive one option at a time, making the conversation a scripted event you have to proceed through. Simply get through the conversation as he explains the plan
Once he is done explaining, you can question why he’s doing this, but more importantly, ask how to get into the brewing vats.

, After you’re finished speaking with Mallus, exit the bar and head out the front gates of Whiterun. The Honningbrew Meadery is located just south of Whiterun. Head down, past the stables, and past the Pelagia farm to reach the Meadery.


Make sure to visit during the day, when the meadery will be open. Most shops are open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

, Enter through the main double doors of the Meadery, and talk with Sabjorn, who will be waiting for you in front of the bar. Offer to help him with the infestation problem in the Meadery basement, and Sabjorn will give you some pest poison.

, Enter the double doors on the right side of the room and head down the stairs in the center. After entering the basement, you will be ambushed by Skeevers, large rodent-like creatures. They’re weak but fast, so try to bring them down with destruction, magic or arrows.


In close combat, they can bite you and infect you with a disease called Ataxia, so take care to keep a good distance.

, After taking down the wave of Skeevers, head forward through the basement until you reach the opposite wall. Look to the right, and you will see a small entrance that leads further underground.


Follow the path to reach the Skeevers nest. Even more will attack than earlier, so be prepared for a nasty fight.
Continue heading down the path, where an ambush of Frostbite spiders is waiting for you. Defeat them the same way you did the Skeevers, and journey deeper into the cave, travelling even further underground.
There are bear traps, wire traps, and a few more Skeevers lurking, so be careful

, After reaching a large chamber, you will face the final boss of this quest, a lone wizard named Hamelyn. Hamelyn has guardian Skeevers to protect him, and casts powerful destruction spells. To defeat him, try to rush him with a physical attack, as he does better with long-ranged combat.

, After killing Hamelyn, you can poison the Skeever nest next to his Alchemy lab by approaching it, and hitting the prompt that appears on the screen.

, After collecting the goodies from Hamelyn’s hideout, head back up the way you came to enter the brewery again. Once you reach the basement, head through the door on the right wall that leads to the boiler.


Head up the stairs that lead to the wooden platforms over the vats, and stand in front of them. Hit the appropriate button when prompted to poison the vat.

, You can now either go on your way and complete the “Dampened Spirits” quest later, or you can talk to Sabjorn to begin the conclusion of the quest.


If you opt to conclude the quest, talk to Sabjorn and wait for him to be arrested. Speak with Mallus afterwards then go open the dresser to the left of the bed upstairs. Take the note in the dresser to Maven in Riften, and then talk to Brynjolf to finish the quest.

Read everything.,
Save your soul gems.,
Keep all your armor, weapons, and accessories.,
Use the skill as much as possible.",How to Raise Your Enchanting Level in Skyrim," There are certain books in Skyrim that will boost your skills. Some of them will increase your enchanting skill. Whenever you see a book you haven’t already read, read it. Even books owned by an NPC (Non Player Character) can be read without stealing and gain skill ups from. Just press the “Steal” button and put it back where you found it., Over the course of the game you will come across many soul gems. You can buy them, get them as drops, or steal them. You can also get a spell called Soul Trap by training up the Conjuration skill which will fill empty soul gems you may find. Every filled soul gem is an opportunity to use your enchantment skill and level it.

, If you pick up a blank piece of armor off a monster, keep it until you can enchant it. This will benefit you in a couple of ways. Even if you do not intend to use the armor and just want to sell it, enchanted armor sells for more and you will have the opportunity to use your enchanting skill. If you find armor with an enchantment on it you do not already have, disenchant it at an enchanting station in order to learn that enchantment for later use.

, When you enchant armor, weapons, and accessories, you are leveling your enchanting skill. As you level up the skill, you can choose perks that will increase your chance of stronger enchantments, add the Soul Trap skill directly onto weapons, and most importantly, gain the ability to add multiple enchantments to an item."

Start a new game.,
When you gain control of the character by being able to look around using your mouse/right stick, change the difficulty setting to Master.,
Choose a race (see the details below and check out How to Create the Right Character for You in Skyrim).

,
Go through the part where you can't do anything but move and jump.,
When you get the bindings off, 'favorite' any spells you want to use.,
Loot all of the things Gunjar has.,
There are going to be Imperials attacking you before long if you are a person who wants to use sneak hide in the corner left of Gunjar (where the rubble is).,
There are going to be some more stuff where they came from.,
The next room is going to have more people, so try to attack them using all the skills you want to use.,
Advance to the torture room, which is occupied by the torturer and his assistant.,
When you go forward there are more cages you can picklock and behind one there is a bag of gold next to a skeleton which might have money and has bonemeal which you can use for alchemy.,
There is going to be a room full of Imperials if the two guys accompanying you didn't die in the torture room then they will probably die here one of them probably has a two handed weapon you can use.,
After that, go on through to the cavern like parts of the keep and stay near the entrance and wait (that doesn't mean using the wait button) until the dragon breaks the bridge and go back and jump down.,
There is going to be a fork where you can go left or right on the middle of the fork there is going to be a skeleton with some stuff.,
Going on from there on the left there is a lifted up platform place with a waterfall next to it there is a skeleton and although unlootable, there is a reasonably good health potion and an iron dagger.,
If you stay for a while, Ralof will give you arrows and a bow.,
When you get outside you can either stay and talk to Ralof and everything or you can just run on looting everything in you path to the Standing Stones.,
After that go along the path to Riverwood there is going to be some wolves, but they are easy.,
After you are free from the weight, you can go get some extra money and experience (if you use a bow) by going talking to either Sven usually found at the Inn or just in the streets.,
If you want to level up your smithing you can do this once by going to Alvor and asking if you he needs help then he will give you some stuff to do then after that you can sell the objects you make.",How to Play Skyrim on Master Difficulty," If you'd rather continue playing where you are, that is on the 'master difficulty', just skip this step.;
,


Press J/Escape/Start.
Going to System > Settings.
Change the difficulty to Master by going right with your right stick or by pressing on the arrow to the right if you are playing on the PC.
Consider making a save here so you don't have to go through the whole intro in the wagon each time you start again.

,, Near the end, choose to go with the guy with the axe (Ralof). This is because when you are with him, you will get attacked by Imperials who have better armor and a better sword weapon (even if you aren't going to use those things, still go with Ralof so you can sell it).

, To 'favorite' something, press F/Y button/triangle button.

, The reason for this is that you don't gain any skills in the subject and therefore don't level up too fast.


This is good because the enemies in Skyrim are slightly leveled, so therefore it is not good just to level up, but to level up by using the right skills. So avoid leveling up the skills you don't want to use. For example, before you read a skill book you will know if it has high value, save and then read it if it is a skill up in a skill you don't want to use then don't read it.

, Sneak attack them when they attack Ralof.


If you are a Breton and use the Conjuration skill, conjure the Familiar before battle.
The Imperials will have both the best light armor and the best heavy armor. You will see them for some time, so equip the weapons you want.
The Imperials will also have iron daggers and Imperial swords. Take both. The Imperial sword will be the best weapon to use, as it is equivalent to a steel sword. The dagger is good if you want to be even more sneaky, as it isn't as noisy as any other weapon.

, Take everything (even the book and the wine, which is very expensive if you look at it from a weight/value perspective). Going on through the locked gate, take any food you can find (the cabbage too).

, And as usual, take their stuff. Make sure you get the food that is everywhere, the salt piles, and the rabbits and pheasants hanging from the rings. There are also potions in the cupboards, so check them out. Remember to favorite the potions you want to use so you can use them quickly.

,


The torturer has a steel dagger, which will be better than the iron one if you want to equip it. The assistant has an iron mace which does more damage, but is slower than the Imperial sword its good if you want to sneak attack someone because of its increased damage.
There is a shield and another mace in the caged kind of room and a book (don't take this one as it isn't expensive) and some lockpicks on the counter. The knapsack has some potions and some more lockpicks and also take the book to sell. Wait a bit (that doesn't mean using the wait button), then Ralof will give you some more lockpicks. Then if you want to use lockpicking as one of your skills, pick lock all the doors.

If you don't want it to be really your skill, only lockpick the door with the magician behind it. Take all his stuff and the book on the floor. If you want, use his robes equip them as they give you more magicka and magicka regeneration. The book teaches you the spell sparks that do extra magicka damage, which is good if you are fighting with mages who will heal themselves.



, In the room that it leads to there are more skeletons with bonemeal and again potentially money. If you are getting encumbered then drop the stuff that costs less and weighs the most. You can do this precisely by dividing the amount of gold you get by the weight.

, There are going to be some Imperials with bows you can take as well as their arrows. Beneath them there is some oil you can light that on fire with a fire spell.

, There is going to be some potions and money near a skeleton. Then there is a tunnel going right back to the original way you were going to go.

, Go right (the way left is a dead end). There are going to be spiders if you go into the cavern where they are more bigger spiders come down from the ceiling. After you dispose of them loot them for Frostbite venom which is fairly powerful. Also, loot the corpses, the balls of web, and the egg sacks for lockpicks, maybe gold, skeever tails, and spider eggs respectively.

, Then on the right there is a wagon full of alcohol and a gold sacks. Next to it there is going to be an iron helmet and some more alcohol.

, There is a bear with bear claws and a bear pelt. This is all except for the exit.

, When you're there choose the one which has most of the skills you are going to use (Archery counts as a thief skill). Remember don't go to the mine shown on your compass just yet first. Its best to go along my way so you can sell all your stuff.

,


When you are there, first sell to the smith then to the innkeeper (who has lots of quests) and then lastly to the Riverwood Trader (he also has one quest). In this order as the Riverwood Trader buys everything but he has limited gold (he also sells useful spells).
If you still haven't sold everything you can sell more by waiting (T/Back/Select) for 48 hours so there money respawns.

, Or Faendal found working in the lumber mill. Get the quest then go to the Riverwood Trader and talk to Camilla. Depending on what you tell her or give her depends on who thanks you and gives you money. If you get Camilla to hate Sven then Faendal will give you money and then you can ask him to be your follower. This way if you want to gain five free skills in Archery every level you can by telling Faendal you want his help then asking him to train you in Archery and when you give him the money tell him that you want to give him some things then take all his gold. The first time you do this you will probably level up.

,


You can go to the Embershard mine southwest of Riverwood. It has lots of good loot including iron ore and a book that improves your smithing.
After that, you can clear the Bleaks Fall Barrow and finish the Golden Claw quest.
Go to Riverwood and do some quests there but it is recommended that you don't try to kill the dragon until you gain some levels. About level 15 should be fine. On that note, remember to be careful when buying perks as there is not much point in buying useless perks.
To increase your smithing, it is most effective (since the 1.5 patch) to make the most expensive things so that means jewelry gives you the most experience.

, This will raise her disposition high enough to make her a candidate for marriage. Just speak to Taarie and select “I want to invest in your business.”


Taarie’s shop, Radiant Raiment, is located near the main gates of Solitude.
Make sure you invest in Taari, not her sister Endarie.

, You can only marry Taarie if you complete the “Fit for a Jarl” quest. To start this quest, talk to Taarie until you will come to a point when you will ask her “So what should I wear to the Blue Palace?” She will then ask you to model some clothing, after which she will give you some gold for your trouble.

, Early the next day, Taarie will be at the Temple of Mara; enter the temple, walk down the aisle, and say your vows.


Congratulations, you’re now legally married in Skyrim!
Though Maramal tells you that the ceremony is to be held between dawn and dusk, you can actually hold the ceremony at any time of day as long as it hasn’t been over 24 hours since you proposed.

Enter Sneak mode.,
Keep an eye on the detection meter.,
Ensure that you are not detected.,
Cautiously sneak up behind the character you’re planning to steal from.,

Select items to steal carefully.,
Steal the item.,
Exit the inventory.,
Kill the target.,
Turn yourself over.,
Pay off the guards for a hefty fine (which depends on your level).,
Run away.,
Engage guards in combat.",How to Pickpocket in Skyrim," To do so, press down on the Left Stick (on PS3 or Xbox 360) or hit the Ctrl key for the PC. Your character will drop down into a crouch, causing you to move more slowly, but lowering the chance that others will detect your presence.


You can exit Sneak mode by hitting the same button you used to enter it.;
, As soon as you enter Sneak mode, a symbol will appear in the very center of the screen. Two horizontal lines adjacent to one another means that your character is currently undetected by anyone else. If another character spots you, a wide open eye will replace the two lines.


Besides the two lines and the open eye, there are mid-levels of detection. If you are crouching, but launch a projectile attack towards an enemy, the eye will appear as half opened, meaning that the enemy suspects someone is nearby, but has not actually spotted you.
If you stay out of sight after getting a half open eye, the enemy will stop searching for you after 30 seconds, and the two horizontal lines will reappear. However, if you are completely detected, the enemy will not give up pursuing you until they find you.

, Do this before you even attempt to pickpocket anyone. Even if the person you intend to steal from isn’t facing you, any other characters nearby that can see you will immediately alert the guards. Check that the meter only shows the two horizontal lines.

, Make sure not to get too close; if you brush against your target, they will notice and accuse you of stealing.

, Once you are about one step behind your target and are still undetected, hit the X button for PS3, A button for Xbox 360, or E key for the PC. This will bring up a menu of the character’s inventory with the bonus of pausing time for as long as the menu is open, giving you ample time to browse.

, Each item in your target’s inventory will be written in red text rather than white, indicating that it will be considered a stolen item if you take it (stolen items cannot be sold to most regular merchants and will be confiscated if you are arrested).


Below the item name and description, there will be a percentage indicating how likely it is that you will be able to steal it without being detected. A good percentage would be anywhere between 80–100%; anything lower than 80% poses a serious risk of detection. Any item 30% or lower is not worth attempting to steal.
The percentage of stealing an item undetected is directly related to how valuable it is; a lockpick will be easy to steal, however, something more valuable will be considerably more of a challenge.

, To steal an item, scroll so that your cursor is over the desired item, and hit the X button (PS3), A button (XBOX 360), or E Key (PC), and the item will be added to your inventory


Stealing will not exit your target’s inventory, so you can continue taking items until you are either caught or you leave the inventory.

, When you’re done, you can exit your target’s inventory. Do this by hitting the O button for the PS3, B button on the Xbox 360, or the Tab key for the PC. This will unpause time and leave you crouching behind your target. If you were not interrupted while taking items, this means that your pickpocketing was successful, and you can be on your way., If you pickpocket fairly often, it’s inevitable that you will be caught. If you try to take an item, and your target suddenly turns around, it means you’ve been detected. Your target will immediately call the guards, and you’ll have a bounty placed on your head. Make a run for it immediately. However, if you’re in a deserted area outside a hold, you can simply kill your target to have the bounty removed. If there are any witnesses, though, you’ll receive an even higher bounty, so it is essential that you are absolutely alone.

, When the guards approach you, you’ll have a few different options. You can surrender yourself over to jail, which means the confiscation of all stolen items in your inventory, as well as a brief period in prison that will randomly lower some of your stats.

, You also have the option to ask for a pardon if you are the Thane of the Hold (a one-time get-out-of-jail-free card), or you can offer to pay off your fine.

, If you are not a Thane and do not want to give up your money, hit the O button (PS3), B button (XBOX 360), or Tab key (PC) to exit the conversation, and run away from the guards. Once you get a good distance away, they’ll give up pursuit.

, If you want, you can kill off the guards, but killing any guards will raise your bounty, so it’s best to make a run for it. Guards won’t follow you too far out of the hold, but your bounty will not disappear until you’ve paid it off, meaning that re-entering the hold you were caught in will result in being apprehended by the guards."

, The quickest way to level up your Block skill is to travel to a giant's camp and start blocking his attacks. Repeat this until your Block reaches 100 (takes only 30 mins or so). Make sure you have enough healing potions and spells. This also works well with Armor skills., The best way to quickly raise your Archery skill is to complete the Dark Brotherhood questline so that you receive Shadowmere, a special horse with a lot of health that regenerates quickly.

You can find this spell at the Halted Stream Camp., Crafting jewelry will raise your Smithing skill, and you can sell this jewelry to make money and purchase more Smithing training. The training is fairly inexpensive up to level 50, and should be easily purchasable with your jewelry profits., You can make these from scrap metals you find in Dwemer ruins. Using Dwarven ingots, create upgraded Dwarven Bows. These will raise your Smithing level significantly., When you’ve reached high levels of Smithing, the best way to keep leveling is to purchase armor from blacksmiths and then upgrade it. You can use items like the Necklace of Haggling to sell the armor back and make a profit from the endeavor as well. Keep upgrading armor to reach Smithing level 100."

Tap the action button.",How to Make Dragon Armor in Skyrim," Crafting mass amounts of items is an expensive endeavor; in practice, your total cost will end up totaling close to 10,000 gold. To offset this intimidating figure:


Complete early-game story quests and side quests. Not only do these have cash rewards, but they also afford the opportunity to pick up sellable items.

Spend as little money as possible. You shouldn't have to buy anything during the early stages of the game; enemies will provide the bulk of your weaponry and armor options.

Pick up every moderately valuable item you can carry. This includes extra weapons, armor, gems, and so on. If you get close to reaching your maximum carry weight, you can always fast travel back to town to get rid of your surplus items.

Sell anything you don't absolutely need. You can do this at any General Store, or you can sell style-specific items at relevant stores (for example, weapons and armor at armory shops).;
, As your character levels up, dragons will become harder to fight; in order to make gathering dragon bones and scales--the crafting components of Dragon armor--less of a challenge, kill as many dragons as you need to as early as possible in the game while the dragons are still at a lower level.

To craft Dragon armor (including a shield), you'll need a total of 12 dragon scales and 6 dragon bones; this figure goes up if you decide you want to make weapons or scaled armor as well. Dragons drop 1 to 3 of both scales and bones when they die.
Since one of the early story missions entails killing a dragon, do the first few story quests.
Dragons tend to appear as you wander through the world, so refrain from fast-traveling to distant objectives.
Provoke every dragon you see.
Use sporadic ranged attacks to weaken dragons; attacking them head-on early in the game will get you killed.

, While perk points will obviously help you in combat, your primary objective is to level up your Smithing as quickly as possible. To that end, you'll want to spend what precious perk points you have on the Smithing tree alone until you obtain the Dragon Smithing perk., You're bound to die a few times as you progress; having multiple saves you can load will make trying to complete the prerequisites here far less frustrating.

You can also set the game's difficulty to ""Novice"" in the ""Gameplay"" tab of the Settings menu to make it easier.

, To level up your Smithing attribute quickly, you will need to craft multiple items. The cheapest (and quickest) way to do this is by crafting iron daggers; each dagger requires the following components:

One iron ingot
One leather strip

, If you haven't done this due to the story yet, do so now. Whiterun has several distinct advantages over the other early-game establishments:

It has an easily-accessible smithing and crafting station.
You can purchase a home right next to the smithing area for 5000 gold.
Whiterun is relatively safe from dragon attacks (especially early in the game).
Your smithing station is part of an armor and weapons store that stocks new iron and leather every 48 in-game hours.
You can purchase a pickaxe and use it to gather iron ore from deposits scattered around Whiterun's outer wall.

, Depending on your character's starting Smithing level, you will have to craft between 500 and 550 daggers. This means you'll need to purchase as much iron and leather as possible:

Assuming you exclusively purchase iron ingots and leather, the wholesale value of the resources needed to craft 550 daggers comes out to about 9,763 gold. You can lower this number by purchasing/smelting ore as often as possible and mining when ore veins replenish.
Economically-speaking, it's better to purchase leather in its whole form, not strips. You can use the tanning station next to the smithing station to convert leather into large quantities of strips.
When buying iron, purchase both ingots and ore; you can smelt one iron ore (using the smelting station right next to the smithing station) to create an iron ingot.
The bulk of the iron and leather you purchase will probably come from the store next to the smithing station; however, Belethor's General Store occasionally stocks iron and leather.
To get stores to refresh their inventory, you'll need to wait (or sleep) for 48 hours in-game. To do this, press your designated ""Wait"" button and move the slider to ""24 hours"", allow the timer to count down, and then repeat the process again.
There are iron ore deposits all around Whiterun's outer walls; taking a pickaxe to these will afford you some ore that you can smelt. Keep in mind that iron ore veins only replenish themselves once every 30 in-game days.
If you encountered the Embershard Mine when emerging from Skyrim's opening act (it's a ways to your right as you leave the cave), you can fast travel there to mine ore and pick up leather. Doing so will also kill some in-game time, meaning stores will refresh sooner.

, This is to your immediate left when standing a few feet from the Whiterun gate; when fast-traveling to Whiterun, you need only walk a few paces forward and then take a right., Make sure you're standing in front of the smithing station when you do this; you should see an option entitled ""Use Blacksmith Forge"".

The action on Xbox 360, for example, is A.
If you bought leather, you'll want to use the tanning rack to create leather strips before using the forge; this is located to the left of the forge, closest to the street.

,,, This will craft one iron dagger; repeat this step for as many iron ingots as you have in your inventory.

After you've depleted your iron supply, you'll need to wait for 48 in-game hours to resupply from shops in the area.
You can sell your crafted iron daggers to the owner of the store next to the smithing area.

, You'll need to do this until you reach Smithing level 100; keep in mind that this may take several hours of real-life time.

As your Smithing level increases, your overall level will gradually increase--thereby earning you a perk point for every level gained. Do not spend these points until you reach Smithing level 100, since you'll likely need all of them to reach the Dragon Smithing perk.

, To do this, open your Character Menu and select the ""Skills"" section, then navigate to the ""Smithing"" perk tree. This tree should say ""Smithing 100""., Press your action button while Steel Smithing is selected to do so. To reach Dragon Smithing, you will need to have 5 or 6 perk points available, the first of which goes to Steel Smithing.

If you go up the left side of the perk tree (which covers light armor and weapons rather than heaver armor and weapons), you will only need 5 perk points.

, On the left side of the perk tree, this is ""Elven Smithing""; on the right, ""Dwarven Smithing"".

While being able to craft the heavier armors on the right might cater to your playing style, the ""Advanced Armors"" perk on the left will allow you to make heavier versions of any armor.

, These include:

Orcish, Ebony, and Daedric Smithing (right side of the tree)
Advanced Armors and Glass Smithing (left side of the tree)

, Once you do so, you will be able to craft the basic Dragon Armor., You'll need to press your action button while facing it.,, This is the default style of Dragon armor, though you can scroll through the ""-bone"" armor to get to the lighter ""-plate"" armor if you like., This will craft a set of Dragon armor for your character's torso., Doing so includes crafting the Dragonbone (or Dragonplate) Boots, Gauntlets, Helmet, and Shield (optional), all of which are beneath the Dragonplate Armor entry.

If you're crafting Dragonplate armor, you'll need to have iron ingots in addition to the other prerequisites.

,, Now that you've created Dragon armor, it's time to equip it!, This is the option to the right.,,, This will equip your selected piece of armor. You have successfully created and equipped Dragon armor! Feel free to repeat this process for the rest of the armor pieces."

Invest in DLCs!,
Lastly, if you play on PC, add mods!",How to Make the Most Out of Your Skyrim Experience," After you escape Helgen and get to Whiterun, start improving your smithing, alchemy, and enchanting. You can get a smithing tutorial from Alvor in Riverwood or Adrianne in Whiterun. Farengar in Dragonsreach will teach you a little bit about enchanting, and Delphine or Orgnar in The Sleeping Giant Inn of Riverwood can give you an alchemy start.;
, Be sure to pick up valuable weapons and armor, too, because they can be sold. Potions are useful for curing diseases, filling your attribute meters, and making more money. Poisons, as well, are deadly, yet expensive. Some miscellaneous items aren't worth taking up, but some are worth the extra weight. Gold, lockpicks, and gems are all key items and can end up handing you some more septims.

, For mages, pick up some spell books, new robes, some magicka and health potions, and even a dagger for extra protection. Warriors may invest in good weapons and armor, poisons and potions, and a few healing or destruction spells. Lastly, stealthy characters should purchase lockpicks, some armor, a bow or dagger, invisibility potions, spells, some poisons and potions.

, Race and item choices should make up whether you want to be a wise mage, strong warrior, or stealthy thief. For example, if you choose a warhammer and heavy armor, you should probably pick a warrior. Players interested in dumber spellcasters may choose a mage. Wood elves who wear light armor and are equipped with a bow and arrow would be a good thief.

, If you're a thief, you should join the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild. Warriors would fit right into the Companions or in a side of the war. Mages are a perfect fit for the College of Winterhold or the Bards College. However, once your skill in those factions are high, you should consider joining the others.

, They just add more fun to the mix. When you've finished the game, be sure to add Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and Hearthfire. Dawnguard gives you two new factions: Dawnguard, the vampire hunters, and Volkihar, the vampires. Dragonborn takes you to Morrowind where you must find and destroy the first Dragonborn, Miraak, before he takes over. Lastly, Hearthfire allows you to build and decorate your own home from scratch, adopt two children, choose any follower as a housecarl or use the provided one, and move them all in.

, Not all of them are cheat mods. There are so many varieties of mods, such as ENBs, lighting, weapons and armor, quests, factions, homes, actions, and even integration between games, such as Mario Bros and Diablo. There are also ways to add mods to Xbox by using a USB, but I've never tried it, so I can't be sure.

Except for the words that are given to you, shouts will require that you absorb a dragon soul before you can use the shout.

Ralof will be heading to a tower to the southwest of where you stand. Follow him into the tower, ensuring the door behind can close. There will be some injured Stormcloak troops inside.;
, Once you have entered this tower, you will need to make your way up the stairs to the right upon entering the door. You will encounter a Stormcloak soldier up ahead mentioning the need to move some rocks to continue up the tower. Alduin will destroy the wall to the right, killing the soldier. You will not be damaged if you are close to the wall when this occurs.

, Ralof will tell you to jump out of the recently made hole onto an inn just below. He mentions he will find another way around and try to meet up with you later. Move towards the hole in the wall, and jump when you are at the edge so you make it to the other building. You will take a little bit of damage but nothing major when taking this jump.

Look for a robed character.,
Approach the robed character and talk to it.",How to Find Spell Vendors in Skyrim," There are quite a few cities that you can visit to find a spell merchant. Cities like Morthal (North of Whiterun), Solitude (northwest of Morthal), and Winterhold (northeast of Morthal) are some of the places you can visit.


Large towns like Whiterun—the first town you’ll find yourself in once you start the game—and Riften (southeast-most corner of the map) also has a spell merchant residing inside.;
, Each city or town has its own castle or town hall, respectively. These buildings are very easy to find since these are the largest structures in the area and are watched by guards (though the main character is free to enter anytime).

, Once you’re inside the city’s castle or town hall, head further inside until you see the Jarl’s throne (which is right in the middle).


Jarls are the leaders of each city or town that reside inside the castle or town hall.

, Once you get to the Jarl’s throne, look around if you see any non-playable character that wears a hooded robe. You’ll often find one right beside or not too far from where the Jarl is—often located inside the rooms right next to the Jarl’s throne.


Spell merchants are mages in nature; they wear a hooded robe of any color, without any armor whatsoever, regardless of their race (Dunmer, Elf, Man, etc.).

, That character will start to ask if you want to buy some spells or books.


Other spell merchants, like those in Winterhold, will tell you a short story first before asking you to buy some items.

There will also be one patrolling the two entrances to this room and one located in the center of the room.


You can take a sneaky approach to this room by using a bow for sneak attacks. Make sure to crouch and stay out of sight to benefit from the 2x attack bonus if they do not see you. This can ensure the enemies go down quickly and help save on arrows.
If you decide to rush in with a sword or magic, make sure to have plenty health potions equipped so you can quickly heal up during battle.

, After you have killed all the Falmer in this room, one of them will be carrying the Focusing Crystal. Make sure to search each of the Falmer until you locate the crystal. This is the only room that the Focusing Crystal will be found, and it will always be carried by one of these enemies.

After reaching the destination, your character will exit the cart and is approached by Hadvar, asking for your identity.

You are now given the choice of who to follow. The path your character follows is identical between the two, with the only variations being which enemies you face. Hadvar is an Imperial, so you will fight Stormcloaks if you side with him, while Ralof is a Stormcloak, so you will face Imperials. This decision does not impact the plot of the game later on. Choose whom you want to follow by running over to their entrance and following him into the keep.

, You will be facing opposition during your escape, so it is important to arm yourself. Your guide will cut your bindings, allowing you to pick up items.

, Continue through the corridor following your guide, and you will eventually come to a cave being guarded by enemy soldiers. Dispose of them, and enter the cave.

As soon as you cross the bridge with your guide, it will be destroyed by a shower of rocks

, You will now be in an even larger cave teaming with frostbite spiders, which will attack. After you defeat them, head through the passage to reach the next chamber. There will be a sleeping bear near the underground river in this part of the cave. Your guide will advise you to sneak past it, but will give you a bow and some arrows in case you want to kill it. Once you have either snuck past or killed the bear, you will reach a crevice in the rock.

, You and your guide will go through the crevice, which leads to the outside of Skyrim. You will have a glimpse of the dragon flying away, and the quest will be completed. You are now free to wander Skyrim!"

Colette will explain that the Augur is a very powerful mage who’s mastered spells that others could barely comprehend. Before you can advance further in the art of restoration, you will need his approval.
After your conversation, you will get a notification that you have started the Restoration Ritual Spell quest.

, Head to the Hall of Countenance in the College of Winterhold. Once there, descend the stairwell until you cannot proceed anymore. There is a trap door located at the base of the stairs that you can use to enter the Midden.


Proceed through the corridor until you reach an open room with two levels. Descend the stairs to your left, and continue through the corridor in the northern corner of the room. This hall will bring you to a door that leads to the Midden Dark; go through it.
Inside the Midden Dark will be a straight hall. Pass through it, over the bridge, and through the hall with ice walls. Take the next left you see, and continue forward until you reach a door. This door will lead to a room with a brilliant light hovering above what appears to be a magical well. This glowing light is the Augur.

, While facing the light, hit the X button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360), or E key (PC) to interact with the Augur. When it asks if you are prepared, you can select the “Prepared for what?” option if you’d like a further explanation of the Augur’s test.


The Augur explains that its test is meant to gauge only your restorative abilities. Tell the Augur that you are ready for the test, and it will direct you to step into the light.

, Step forward into the light, and the test will begin. Your character will be stripped of all gear and weapons, left only with their spells. Two ghosts will appear and begin to attack your character. These ghosts are completely immune to any attacks, so bringing a follower along is rather pointless.


Unlike most boss battles, your goal here is not to defeat the ghosts; it is a survival test. Equip your character with your most powerful healing spells and continually cast them to keep your character from dying. If your health and magicka get low, the best strategy is simply to avoid the ghost’s fire attacks.
After a minute has passed, the ghosts will disappear and the quest will be completed. For proving yourself to the Augur, you will receive a powerful spell called Bane of the Undead. This completes the Restoration Ritual Spell quest.
After completing the quest, you will also be able to purchase master level Restoration spells from Colette, such as Guardian Circle.

To check your conjuration level, open the menu (O button on PS3, B button on XBOX 360, and Tab key on PC), and press in the upward direction to open up the Skills menu.

The skills menu is sorted into Thief skills, Warrior skills, and Mage skills, the latter of which can be identified by its blue background. Scroll to the left until you are in the Mage Skills area; simply wait until you see Conjuration Magic, and your level will be displayed right below it.;
, If you are in need of more Conjuration spells, simply visit the court wizard of any major hold. You can speak to the following wizards:

Wuunferth the Unliving in Windhelm
Sybille Stentor in Solitude
Madena in The White Hall
Calcelmo in Markarth
Wylandriah in Riften
Farengar Secret-Fire in Whiterun

, When they ask what you need, ask what they have for sale, and you will be able to scroll through their wares., Common Conjuration spells that don’t take up a lot of Magicka are: Bound Sword, Bound Battle Axe, Conjure Flame Atronach, and Soul Trap. All of these spells can be purchased from the court wizards listed above.

To purchase a spell, approach any of the court wizards, and hit the X button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360), and E key (PC) to interact with them. They’ll ask you what you need; scroll down to the dialogue option “What do you have for sale?” to browse their wares.
Use the same button listed above to purchase a spell while your cursor is over it. Conjuration spells typically range between 200 and 1,000 Gold.

, The fastest way to level up Conjuration is to repeatedly use the Soul Trap spell on a dead body. Soul Trap only works on creatures under a certain level, so it is easiest to use on the wildlife you can find in any part of Skyrim.

Once you have killed your target, approach it and equip the Soul Trap spell. To do this, open up the menu once more, hit the left direction button to look at your skills. Go to the Conjuration section, scroll until you reach “Soul Trap,” and hit the button you wish to equip the spell to (L1 for left hand PS3, LT for left hand XBOX 360, and left-click for left hand PC)
Hit the button you’ve equipped the spell to to cast the spell, and repeat this to level up Conjuration. Depending on how quickly your character’s Magicka regenerates, as well as how much Magicka they have, this could take a few hours.

, After you have successfully raised your Conjuration magic to at least 90, you must find Phinis to begin the Conjuration Ritual quest. Travel to the College of Winterhold, in the far northeastern reaches of Skyrim., During the night (from midnight to seven) and early morning hours (from about 7AM until the afternoon), he can be found eating in his room or wandering around it. His room is located on the ground floor of the Hall of Countenance. From the afternoon until 10PM, Phinis will wander around the Hall of Attainment or retire to his room, where he will spend the rest of the night, When the dialogue options appear, ask if you can learn more about Conjuration. He will say that to learn the more advanced spells of Conjuration, he will need a Sigil Stone. To obtain a Sigil Stone, you will need to summon an unbound Dremora, and make it retrieve one for you. Phinis will give you the spell to do so, warning that Unbound Dremora are difficult to control., You will have to engage the Dremora in combat and defeat it to reach the next part of the ritual, so make any preparations you must. Dremora are susceptible to fire magic and any weapons equipped to deal Magicka damage. This fight can be difficult, so bringing along a companion is recommended., The door to the Hall of Attainment is located across the college’s main courtyard and serves as the second sleeping quarter for students. Simply enter it and ascend the two flights of stairs, taking the door that leads to the top of the tower.

In the very center of the tower, there will be a circle of candles surrounding a piece of stone with an eye inscribed on it. This is where you will be summoning Unbound Dremora.

, To summon the Dremora, stand in front of the circle and equip the spell. Do this by opening the menu, toggling left to “Skills,” selecting the “Conjuration” category, and selecting the “Summon: Unbound Dremora” spell.

Unlike most conjuration spells, this one takes a few seconds to execute. You must be standing in front of the circle, aiming at the eye in the center, and then hold down whichever button you equipped the spell to. Do this until there is a flash of light and the summoning animation begins.

, After you have successfully summoned the Dremora, it will be enraged at you for bringing it to the human realm. Regardless of which dialogue option you select, it will attack.

The Dremora is equipped with Daedric armor, meaning direct physical attacks won’t do much. Enchanted weapons are very effective, however. The Dremora fights only with a great sword, so retreating and attacking from a distance is also a good choice in tactics.

, After you defeat the Dremora, it will disappear back into its own realm. Unfortunately, Dremora are very stubborn, so you will have to fight it once more. Exactly the same as before, stand in front of the stone circle and summon the Unbound Dremora. It will be even more angry, claiming it is not your plaything. Regardless of which dialogue option you choose, it will attack again., During the second fight, the Dremora does not employ any new tactics, so you can beat it the same way you did before. After defeating the Dremora, it will disappear the same way it did before, For the third time, approach the circle and cast the “Summon: Unbound Dremora” spell. The Dremora will still be angry. Ask it if it will submit, and it will finally concede that you are its master. The Dremora will ask what your bidding is; reply that you want a Sigil Stone. It will reply that the next time you summon it, the Sigil Stone will be yours., For the fourth and final time, repeat the summoning of the Dremora. It will hand you over the Sigil Stone.

After this, you will be unable to summon the Unbound Dremora again, although the Dremora will remain on the college campus and can be seen wandering around the grounds.

, Enter the Hall of Attainment once more, descend the two flights of stairs, and exit the Hall of Attainment on the ground floor. Walk across the courtyard, and enter the Hall of Countenance., Scroll through the dialogue options, and hit the second to last one, which reads “I have your Sigil Stone.” He will claim that the stone is yours, and is only borrowing it. The stone will be removed from your inventory, and the conversation will end., Scroll down to the dialogue option “What did you see?” Phinis will tell you he has the knowledge he needs and will return the stone to you, as well as Spell Tome: Flame Thrall. This will complete the quest. After this, you will be able to purchase Master Level Conjuration Spell tomes from Phinis."

, Once Morokei is defeated, approach and search Morokei’s ashes to retrieve his mask and the Staff of Magnus.

, After killing Morokei, you’ll find a door inside the Labyrinthian Tribune that leads back to the outside world. Exit through this door and head back to Winterhold, taking the northeastern road from where you are.

If you have reached stage 4 vampirism (by going too many days without feeding), townsfolk will attack you on sight (including innkeepers). You will need to feed or use a blood potion to lower your vampirism level before you are able to speak to an innkeeper for the quest.

, He will tell you about the ritual that cures vampirism, and ask you to bring him a filled black soul gem as the next part of the quest.


Morthal is located north of Whiterun. Falion typically resides in his house, which will be labeled as such on your map.

, Unlike other soul gems, black soul gems are filled with human souls. You will need to kill a human with a weapon enchanted with Soul Trap or by casting the Soul Trap spell on them.


Soul trap tomes can be purchased from a few different vendors, including the court mages at Whiterun and Windhelm or from one of the mages at the College of Winterhold.

, Enter the largest tower in the area called “The Hall of Elements.” Inside you’ll find Ancano casting spells at a great sphere called the Eye of Magnus.

With your cursor over the spell, hit the X button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360), and E key (PC) to purchase the spell., Although it is monotonous, the fastest way to level up Alteration magic is to equip the spell Candlelight onto both hands. Do this by opening up the character menu, toggling to the left for magic, and scrolling through the Alteration category. To equip it to both hands, hit the R1 and L1 button (PS3), RT and LT button (Xbox 360), Left-Click and Right-Click (PC). Once it’s equipped, repeatedly cast it as you walk around a major hold. Doing this will take about a few hours until you reach level 50., Once your Alteration magic has reached level 50, you can purchase the spell tome Detect Life, which raises your Alteration level much more quickly. This spell can be purchased from Tolfdir, who can be found in the College of Winterhold, located in the City of Winterhold, in the far northeastern corner of Skyrim.

During the daytime (between 8AM and 10PM), Tolfdir wanders around the Hall of Attainment, and during the night, he can be found in his room (also in the Hall of Attainment) on the ground floor.

, Once you have purchased Detect Life, cast it in highly populated areas. Every time you cast it, you should go up a level.

, Each dungeon has its own unique layout; however, it should not take more than 20 minutes to reach the end., At the dead end of the dungeon, there will be a sarcophagus for you to open with a dragon priest inside. You will have to defeat the dragon priest before you can collect the dagger.

Dragon Priests are exceptionally powerful enemies, so it is recommended that you bring a follower.
Most dragon priests use magic and are weak to lightning spells (as those drain mana). Be prepared to use your most powerful potions to stay alive, as Dragon Priests are incredibly hard to kill.

, Once you have defeated the dragon priest, approach the chest behind his sarcophagus, open it, and get the dagger., Once you have Kahvozein’s Fang, you’ll need to find a dragon to harvest the scales from. You can either find a dragon corpse from one you previously defeated or you can find and battle a new one.

Although dragons appear randomly, you can increase the likelihood of encountering them by travelling across Skyrim on foot/horseback rather than fast travelling.
Certain locations are more likely to attract dragons than others. Any of the Shout Word Altars are likely locations. Shout Altars appear on your world map as dragon heads. One you have encountered earlier in the game is to the south of Ivarstead.

, If you found a dragon corpse for you to get the Heartscales from, skip to the next step. If you found a dragon to battle, proceed as you normally would to kill it. You do not have to use the dagger until after the battle. As usual, dragons are easiest to target when they’re stationary, so wait to hit them with projectiles until they land., After you have felled the dragon and absorbed its soul, approach the corpse with the Kahvozein’s Fang equipped. Interact with the dragon skeleton to collect the Heartscales., Return to the College of Winterhold and find Tolfdir; he can be found in the same places mentioned earlier., Talk to Tolfdir, and select the dialogue option “Here’s your Heartscale.” After this interaction, he will give you the master spell tome Dragonhide.

Activate the Purity radiant quest.,
Get a Glenmoril witch head.,
Head to Ysgramor’s Tomb.,
Enter the tomb.,
Activate the flame.,
Kill the Wolf Spirit.,
Talk to the quest giver (Farkas or Vilkas).,
Cure yourself of lycanthropy.",How to Cure Lycanthropy in Skyrim1," After completing the “Glory of the Dead” quest, talk to either Farkas or Vilkas (both can be found in their quarters, which are located in the basement floor of Jorrvaskr) as you normally would to receive work. They will seem a bit out of sorts. Be empathetic and ask what’s troubling them.


They will reveal that they want to make the same choice that Kodlak did, and cure themselves of their lycanthropy. Offer to help them.
Radiant quests are given by Vilkas or Farkas when your character asks about work for the Companions, and most of them can be repeated any number of times to make a profit. However, after the final quest of the main Companions storyline is completed, you will be able to receive the “Purity” quest.;
, If you already have a Glenmoril witch head in your inventory leftover from the previous quest, they will urge you on to Ysgramor’s Tomb (skip to the next step); otherwise, they will offer to help you get one.


Fast travel to the Glenmoril Coven. After completing the “Blood’s Honor” quest, it should be an accessible location on the world map. It is located northwest of Falkreath.
Enter the coven and you will find five Glenmoril witches there. Kill them and loot their bodies to gather at least two heads (one for the quest giver, and one for you).

, Journey to Ysgramor’s tomb with the quest giver. You can either fast travel there or follow the active quest marker on your compass. Ysgramor’s tomb is in the far northern region of Skyrim; the major hold that it is nearest to is Winterhold, whose icon on the map looks like a 3-pointed crown within a shield.


To reach Ysgramor’s Tomb from Winterhold, head north and pass over the water. The tomb is located right on the bank of a small island.
To reach Ysgramor’s Tomb from Whiterun is a much longer journey. The tomb is located northeast of Whiterun. After exiting Whiterun, go past the town walls in the north and continue heading north. You will pass many mountains along the way, but do not stop until you reach Dawnstar. After reaching Dawnstar, head northeast and cross the water to reach the banks of the island where the tomb is located.

, Open the doors to the tomb and descend the stone steps. Head straight past the torches until you reach the set of wooden spiral stairs leading down further into the tomb.


Descend the stairs, which will lead you to a large open room with a blue flame, called the Flame of the Harbinger, burning in the center.

, Approach the Flame of the Harbinger and activate it with the appropriate button prompt on the screen.

, After activating the flame, a spectral wolf will leap out from the altar and begin attacking you. Defeat it to cleanse your quest giver of his lycanthropy.


The spirit behaves like a wolf you might run into in the wild; simply keep it at a distance by casting fireball spells or using arrows to easily bring it down.
This wolf is not a particularly difficult enemy. It’s most challenging feature is it’s speed, hence the need to keep a distance. However if you favor close combat, heavy hitters will quickly be able to kill the wolf with a few swings of a warhammer.

, After defeating the wolf, you will be prompted to talk to your quest giver. He’ll ask if it’s over, and explain how he feels like a proper warrior now.


After talking to your quest giver, the Purity radiant quest will be marked as completed.

, Approach the flame, and activate it again by pressing the button displayed on the screen. A text box will appear asking, “Cast the witch’s head into the flames to cure your lycanthropy forever” Select yes (note that this is a permanent decision).


Another wolf spirit will emerge from the flame, which you must vanquish to cure yourself. Use the same methods for killing this wolf as you killed the first one.
Once you have defeated the wolf, you will be cured from your lycanthropy

Play a straightforward warrior.,
Create a thief.,
Make an assassin or archer.,
Play as a mage.,
Choose a more complex character.",How to Create the Right Character for You in Skyrim1," Do you feel like playing a straightforward, melee, damage-dealing character? If so, you have two main options. Also, check out the next step below these for more versatile options that are still focused on melee combat.


The Nord is a great option for a first character. You'll be skilled at two-handed weapons, will get more money for selling loot, and have a Light Armor bonus and racial abilities that keeps you mobile and able to survive the early game.The Orc is phenomenal at surviving damage, and dealing damage in melee.With immediate access to Orc stores and trainers, bonuses to crafting armor and weapons, and bonuses to both one-handed and two-handed weapons, you'll have many options to choose from.;
, If you enjoy playing sneaky characters, but want to specialize in stealing and exploration more than combat, make an Argonian or a Khajiit. The higher starting Lockpicking and Pickpocket skills are particularly useful at the beginning of the game, since improving them at a reasonable pace requires succeeding on the attempts in the first place.Argonians have a better Lockpicking bonus, a Light Armor bonus, and a racial ability that regenerates health once per day. All of these will make life as a low-level sneaky character a bit easier.
The Khajiit have a better unarmed damage bonus, a better Sneak bonus, an Archery bonus, and tend to be more versatile. Pick this if you are not fully committed to the thief archetype, or you want to be a well-rounded combat character as well.

, Sneaky characters who are also good at combat prefer bonuses to Sneak, Archery, Alchemy, and Light Armor. The Khajiit and Wood Elf are excellent options, while the Dark Elf is a fine choice if you'd also like to dabble in Magic., There are several different types of magic, but you don't need to pick just one. High Elves have bonuses to all five, plus large bonuses to Magicka (the energy or mana used to cast spells). They are great for an overall mage character build and are a good starting race for newcomers.Bretons are versatile mages as well, though especially excellent at Conjuration. Bretons also specialize in more magic and sword gameplay, as they often specialize in skills that aid you in battle., Dark Elves have bonuses to offensive magic and stealth, and can be played as mage-assassins or mage-thieves. They are also great for the overall adventurer as they specialize in multiple skills.Imperials are quite strong at both melee combat and magic, especially healing magic. Imperials are very charismatic and are great for a merchant, or just an over all charismatic character. Imperials have a bonus in the speech skill which is a major benefit to thieves, merchants, and assassins. Finally, Redguards are the best at using one-handed weapons, but have fairly unfocused bonuses in general. Consider playing a Redguard if you want to try out several styles of play right off the bat, but don't expect to be too powerful at any one task. Redguards are good for one-handed and sword and shield users."

Get the Dawnguard DLC.,
Accept Lord Harkon’s gift.,
Have Serana turn you into a vampire lord.,
Become a vampire lord after the Dawnguard DLC quest completion.",How to Cure Lycanthropy in Skyrim2," If you did not cure your lycanthropy in the Ysgramor’s Tomb, the Dawnguard DLC (which can be purchased on Steam, or by buying the expansion pack of Skyrim at your local/online game store) gives you three opportunities to rid yourself of your beast-blood.


The Dawnguard DLC centers on the ancient battle between vampires and their hunters, with you being forced to pick a side to fight on. If you side with the vampires, you will be turned into a vampire lord, a much stronger version of the typical vampires you come across in game.
Turning into a vampire lord will cleanse you of your lycanthropy since it is impossible to be a werewolf and vampire at the same time.

, The first time you are given the option to become a vampire lord is during the “Bloodline” quest, one of the earlier quests in the Dawnguard DLC.


After completing the “Awakening” quest, Serana will ask you to take her to Castle Volkihar, home to the first vampires of Skyrim. You can reach the castle by boat: either hire a ferryman to take you there or take an Ice-water Jetty, which is a small dock near the Northwatch Keep. Boarding the boat will take you to the castle
Ascend the hill to the stone bridge that leads up to the looming castle. The vampires will be wary of you, but they will allow you to pass once they recognize Serana.
Enter the castle to find Serana’s father. Once Serana is reunited with her father, he will approach you and give you an ultimatum: continue working with the Dawnguard, forbidden from visiting the castle again, or join the Volkihar vampires by becoming a vampire lord.
Choose to become a vampire lord, and Lord Harkon will explain that it will purge you of your lycanthropy (note that choosing to become a vampire lord will make you an enemy of the Dawnguard, who will send out soldiers to ambush you at random).

, If you did not accept Lord Harkon’s gift of vampirism, you will be offered another chance later on during the “Chasing Echoes” quest, which is the 6th quest in the main Dawnguard questline. During this quest, you and Serana must journey into the Soul Cairn, a gloomy alternate plane of reality where lost souls are doomed to wander.


The Soul Cairn is located in a secret section of Castle Volkihar that Serana will guide you to. A live person cannot enter the Soul Cairn, so Serana will offer to turn you into a Vampire Lord herself.
Select the option “Turn me into a vampire,” and Serana will bite you, and you will fall unconscious. After a short time, you will reawaken as a vampire lord, and subsequently be cured of your lycanthropy.
If you decline, your soul will be temporarily trapped in a soul gem, which greatly depletes your Health, Stamina, and Magicka while in the Soul Cairn.

, After completing “Kindred Judgement,” the final quest in the DLC, you will be able to ask Serana to turn him into a vampire lord at any time.


Serana can be found in Castle Volkihar, standing in the foyer. Approach her, and hit the appropriate button to interact with her. If you have not already become a vampire lord, she will offer to turn you into one. Accept her offer.
After being bitten, you will black out. Upon regaining consciousness, you will be a vampire lord and cured of your lycanthropy
Note that if you urge Serana to cure herself of vampirism instead, she will no longer be able to transform you into a vampire lord.

Know which racial abilities are the most powerful.,
Think about convenience.,
Don't over-think other racial bonuses.,
Choose your character's sex.,
Think about story or dialogue.,
Understand how ""class"" works.,
Plan out your build.",How to Create the Right Character for You in Skyrim2," If you're having trouble deciding, you might want to pick a race with abilities that remain powerful throughout the game. Here are the few abilities that will still feel useful even when you're a high-level adventurer:


The Orc's berserk ability and the Breton's magic resistance are probably the most powerful and versatile options.The Imperial and Nord active abilities remain unique and effective, though somewhat narrow.

, Some abilities aren't that powerful, but occur often enough to save you significant preparation or healing time. The Dark Elf's fire resistance ends up being relevant more often than most other racial resistances, for instance.The Wood Elf's resistance to poison and disease is not at all necessary, but it does save you time micromanaging potions and temple visits. (Redguards and Argonians receive 1/2 of this ability each.)


While the Argonians' water breathing and the Khajiit's night vision sound like they would open up unique exploration options, it turns out these are rarely useful.

, Your racial skill bonuses and abilities will be useful as a low-level character, making some play styles much easier than others. However, as you train skills and gain perks, your race will matter less and less. In general, once you've narrowed your choice down to a few options, there's little harm in picking the race that appeals to you on a visual or story basis.

, Your character's sex has only minor effects on gameplay. Some quests and perks give bonuses to interactions with the opposite sex, such as cheaper store prices or higher damage.Female characters are rumored to move at a slightly slower pace, but this is difficult to notice. Romance and marriage options are not affected by sex., Your character's race and sex will change NPC dialogue, but this rarely changes the fundamentals of a quest or conversation. Unless you have played other Elder Scrolls games and have an idea of which race you'd like to identify as, there's no real reason to pick one race over another for your first character. Of course, even new players often have a preferred race based on first impressions, and choosing a race you like may make the game more enjoyable.


If you make additional characters, consider choosing a variety of races, and both sexes, so you have a chance to explore alternate dialogue.

, If you've played earlier Elder Scrolls games, or almost any other roleplaying game, you might be wondering why there's no class option. In Skyrim, all your actions improve as you perform them. For instance, when you successfully pickpocket someone, your Pickpocket skill improves. Other customization comes through the ""perks"" system, but neither of these methods of advancement are restricted by decisions made at character creation.


Early on in the game, you'll be introduced to Standing Stones. While the first ones you see sound similar to classes (Thief, Mage, or Warrior), you will be able to switch between them as many times as you like., If you'd like to delve into the mechanics of Skyrim characters, you can plan out your entire character before you create him or her. This is only recommended for people who get most of their gameplay enjoyment from optimization, or for experienced Skyrim players. Try searching for character builds online, or plan out your own using SkyrimCalculator or the IGN Skill sBuilder.

You can check the level of your Destruction by pausing the game and opening the In Game Menu. Select “Skills” from the four options, and you should see the level of your Destruction Skill here, among with other skills of your character.;
, The College of Winterhold is located on the northeastern corner of the map. Take the road just outside the city of Windhelm that leads north and it will take you straight to Winterhold.

, From the main courtyard of the College of Winterhold, head right along the wall and you’ll find the Hall of Countenance. Enter this building and inside you’ll find a female mage named Faralda.


Talk to Faralda and select “What else is there to be learned about Destruction magic?” from the list of available responses. She will then give you book with a single page that you’ll need to take to somewhere north of Skyrim (this marks the start of “Destruction Ritual Spell” quest).

, From Winterhold, take the road leading westward to the city of Dawnstar. Once you’re in Dawnstar, take the road southwards and you should come across the Windward Ruins.

, In the ruins you’ll see a pedestal, just approach it and place the book Faralda gave you on it.

, The second objective will appear on the screen.


Take the book before exiting the area.

, Travel to the Throat of the World (south of Whiterun), and from there, go down the mountain path southward. You’ll come across a semi-circle stone building. This is the North Skybound Watch.

, Once you enter the Watch, you’ll see another pedestal, just place the book on it.

, This will trigger the third objective of the quest.


Take the book before exiting the area.

, From Markarth, take the open road heading eastward and continue along the path until you cross a river. Keep walking a few more miles after the river and you should find Four Skull Lookout—a building that looks just like North Skybound Watch in step 5.

, Enter the Lookout, and you’ll see another pedestal. Place the book on it.

, Some changes will happen to the book.

, After casting the last spell, approach the pedestal and read the book. It will now teach you the Firestorm spell.

Upgrade your armor to Legendary.,
Wear your new armor.",How to Craft the Best Gear in Skyrim," This will be one of the most important thing you'll need in order to make strong equipment.;
, Crafting armor requires ingredients; the ingredients vary depending on what armor you’ll craft. Collect the ingredients needed for the particular armor you’ve chosen to make.

, You could do with just Smithing, but a higher level Enchantment can boost the quality of the items further.

, These are rings, gloves, body armor, and necklaces.

, Grand Soul gems are preferred, but you can get any other type of soul gems.

, You can usually find these in alchemist shops.

, Disenchant one of your items with Fortify Smithing, and equip the other one.


You'll need to disenchant an item in order to gain knowledge of that enchantment; this is why you need two of each.

, You can use an Enchanter's Elixir for this. With a level 100 enchanting, plus an Enchanter's Elixir, your Smithing Enchantment will reach 28%.

, Wear all of your newly enchanted armor, drink your Blacksmith's Elixir, and craft all your weapons and armor.


Blacksmith's Elixir only lasts 30 secs; the time runs even when you're crafting, so be mindful of the time limit.

, Go to the Grindstone and drink another Blacksmith's elixir, then upgrade your weapon until they are Legendary. This will boost your weapon's damage to around 50% or more.

, Use the Workbench if you think you've still got time before the Blacksmith Elixir expires. Immediately proceed to upgrading your armor to legendary, if not then take a Blacksmith's Elixir first.


Like the weapon, your armor's defense will increase dramatically once it turns legendary.

, You'll probably kill almost anything in 1 hit or so. Of course, that would make the game a tad bit boring, but it's always useful for those difficult missions. Have fun!

Complete the Throat of the World quest.",How to Complete the Throat of the World Quest in Skyrim," It’s the highest peak on the land of Skyrim. From the city of Whiterun, head southeast just a couple of miles and you’ll see a snowy peak mountain on the horizon. This is the Throat of the World. Make your way to its foot and you’ll a find a series of old dilapidated stone stairwell called the Seven Thousand Steps.;
, This is the monastery of the order of Greybeards, masters of the Thu'um, or “the Voice.” It lies on the upper regions of the Throat of the World. To get to High Rothgar, simply follow the Seven Thousand Steps staircase until you get to the top, where you’ll find a large stone building.

, Arngeir is the highest priest in the Greybeard order. He wears a dark gray hooded robe. Enter High Hrothgar and talk to Arngeir about how to defeat Alduin, and he will eventually speak and teach you a dragon shout called Clear Skies, which clears rough weather of a large area.

, Arngeir will tell you that if you wish to find out how to defeat Alduin, you need to talk to a dragon, called Paarthurnax, residing at the top of the Throat of the World. Head outside High Hrothgar through the door Arngeir will point you to.

, Once you step outside, you’ll find that a very strong wind is blowing, and you’ll have a very hard time to walk. Open your in-game menu and select “Magic.” Choose “Shouts” from the menu panel on the right-hand side of the game screen, and select “Clear Skies” to calm the weather and make it easier for you to walk.

, Once the wind has calmed down, follow the path you see on the area, which leads to the top of the peak. At the top of the Throat of the World you’ll see a dragon sitting on top of a large, broken stone wall. This is Paarthurnax.


If the wind becomes strong again as you climb up, just use the Clear Skies shout to calm it down once more.

, Approach the dragon and talk to him. Paarthurnax will tell you the story of who Alduin is and how he was defeated through the use of an item called the Elder Scrolls many centuries ago. After that, he will speak and teach you the Dragonrend, a shout capable of bringing down airborne dragons.

, After you learn the Dragonrend, Paarthurnax will talk a little more about the Elder Scrolls but then tell you that he doesn’t know its whereabouts. Instead, he advises you to talk to Arngeir or Esbern, which concludes the mission.

Know the benefits for resolving the quest.,

Find Sven or Faendal, and talk to him.,
Initiate the quest.,
Decide if you want to show the forged letter to the other suitor.,
Find Camillo and talk to her.,
Find either Sven or Faendal, or whoever you have decided to help.",How to Complete the Love Triangle Quest in Skyrim," There are two bachelors in Riverwood trying to woo Camillo, the sister of Lucon, the owner of the Riverwood Trader. One is a Nord named Sven who is a Bard at the local tavern. You can generally find him either in the Sleeping Giant Inn or his home (Sven and Hilde’s House). The other bachelor is an Elf named Faendal who is an archer and works at the lumber mill.;
, Camillo is usually in the Riverwood Trader, but in the evenings you may find her at the Sleeping Giant Inn. Between 10PM and midnight, she tends to wander around the sleeping town.


Sven is usually at the Sleeping Giant Inn, but you may find him in his house (Sven and Hilde’s House).
Faendal is the most difficult to locate because essentially he has two jobs. From about 4AM to 7AM he hunts, and then he works at the mill from 7AM until 7PM. Between 7PM and 4AM, you are likely to find him in his house. Otherwise, you may need to spend a little time wandering around town looking for him. If you don’t see him around town, check the time because he is out hunting for about three hours in the morning.

, If you are certain that you want to bother doing the quest, there are indeed benefits from helping one of the two suitors.


Once you report back to the bachelor you have chosen to help, he will give you Gold for your services.
Whenever you return to Riverwood, you can recruit Sven or Faendal to follow you on quests.
As an archer who is willing to teach you, Faendal is the obvious favorite. He is considerably more helpful in fighting, meaning he is more than just a way to help carry your overflow inventory. You can also have him train you in Archery when you are on quests. There are no such benefits from helping Sven; he tells you to go to the Bard College instead of training you to be a Bard.

, You can listen to the gossip and hear that there are two guys trying to woo Camillo, but you don’t have to as neither are shy about voicing their opposition to the other to a complete stranger.

, It does not matter which one you talk to because they both have the same idea: write a deceitful letter to Camillo, and say it is from the other suitor.

, Choose who you want to go to, Sven or Faendal.


Select “You and Faendal both like the same girl?” if you go to Sven. He will tell you about Camillo and his chief romance rival Faendal. You can respond with either of the two options when he stops. He will give you a letter to deliver to Camillo. Sven’s forged letter says that Faendal is happy to have Camillo as a friend, but that they can never be more than that because it would sully his elven heritage.
You can continue to talk to Sven about other things if you like. Asking him about how he learned to play so well will initiate the quest to visit the Bard’s College in Solitude.
Select “What’s your problem with Sven?” He will tell you about Camillo and his chief romance rival Sven. You can respond with either of the two options when he stops. He will give you a letter to deliver to Camillo. Faendal’s forged letter is a poem from Sven saying that he looks forward to having Camillo take care of the cooking and cleaning.
You can continue to talk to Faendal and ask him to train you in Archery.

, If you decide to show it to the rival party, he will respond by giving you a forged letter of his own. This is optional as you can go right to Camillo once you have the first letter.


If you talk to both suitors, you will only have the letter from one when you go to talk to Camillo (unless you pickpocket it from the second man you talk to). You definitely do not need both letters as you will be able to help the bachelor you prefer when you hand over the forged letter.

, You can now either tell her the truth about where the letter came from or you can lie about it.


Telling her the truth helps the suitor who is being slandered. If you talk to both bachelors, you won’t get to tell her that they both tried to do the same thing, just the last one you spoke to.
If you tell her a lie, she will believe you. This will help the suitor who forged the letter.

, Tell him that you don’t think the other suitor will be a problem anymore. Both of them will give you Gold, and will become possible followers.

They will chase after you, but don’t worry: they are unarmed, and you can simply kill them. Kill them and take their hearts and the key to the shrine.


If you find killing the Daedras difficult, try running around the altar backward while shooting or casting magic on them. You can also use a blade.;
, Enter the shrine, where you will see two more Daedras. Kill them as well, and take their hearts.


The Daedras inside the shrine include a mage and a two-hander. Kill the mage first; he’s more dangerous.
While you’re in the shrine, you can also obtain some ebony ingots. From the door, look toward the left side of the room. You’ll see a small crate with ebony ingots inside. Take them! They will come in handy.
If you let a week pass (within the game) and come back to the Shrine of Mehrunes, the Daedras will spawn again. Every week, you can pick up two more hearts.

, You can also steal a heart. Travel to Whiterun and enter the Companions’ Hall of Jorrvaskr. Walk to your right and down the stairs to enter the living quarters. Head down the long hallway and into the room at the end of it, and you will see a Daedra heart on top of the table on your left.


If your stealth level is low, wait for all the people in the Companions’ Hall to fall asleep before you steal the heart.

, You must complete the “Dark Brotherhood” side quest first. Then travel to Dawnstar Sanctuary and look for a black door with a skull carved on it. Inside you will find an NPC (Non-Player Character) who will sell you Daedra hearts.


There is some luck involved in this method. The NPC will not sell Daedra hearts all the time.

, Enter the Hall of Attainment in the center of the College of Winterhold. Talk to Enthir and ask him, “What’s not allowed here?” When you do, he will sell you a Daedra heart.


Note that this method will no longer work once you finish the “College of Winterhold” side quest and become an archmage. After that, Enthir will no longer sell you hearts.

, If you go to Whiterun and enter Belethor’s store, he will have some ebony ingots for sale.

, Once you exit Belethor’s store, head up the stairs. At the top, go down the flight of stairs to your right. Head north until you see the Warmaiden’s shop. The man at the counter will sell you ebony ingots.

, During the day, you can find Adrianne Avenicci in front of the Warmaiden’s shop. She will also sell you ebony ingots.

, If you don’t want to buy the ingots, you can craft them. Go to Windhelm and head southwest. Keep walking until you see a stronghold guided by an orc. Skip through the dialogue and ask the orc to let you in. Once inside the small orc village of Narzulbur, walk further east past the bridge, where you will find Gloombound Mine. Take a pickax, mine the ebony ores, and then head outside to smelt your ingots.


Note that you will need two ebony ores to craft one ebony ingot.

, Leather strips are readily available in any blacksmith store. They cost only about three gold per piece.

, You can also craft the strips yourself. Use the tanning rack available in any blacksmith’s house.


Note that you will need one leather piece to make four leather strips.

, Once you have gathered all the materials, go to any forge you like. Once there, scroll down your list of craftable items, and choose Daedric Armor (also note that your smithing attribute must be at least 90).

Solve the puzzle and retrieve the Elder scroll.,
Pick up the Elder Scroll.",How to Complete the Elder Knowledge Quest in Skyrim," You can start this quest by speaking with Paarthurnax, located at the Throat of the World. Paarthurnax will reveal the history of the Dragon War. The Nords used the Elder Scroll as their last resort to banish Alduin. What they didn’t know was it simply sent Alduin forward in time, postponing the inevitable threat. In order to locate the Elder Scroll, you will need to speak with Esbern or Arngeir for further information of its whereabouts.
, It doesn’t matter who you decide to speak with when looking for information on the Elder Scroll. Both Esbern and Arngeir will point you towards the College of Winterhold as a place to start finding more on the whereabouts of the Elder Scroll. You can locate Esbern outside of the Sky Haven Temple east of Markarth. Arngeir can be found at High Hrothgar either reading, meditating, or sleeping. Your quest book will update and tell you to find more about the Elder Scroll at the College of Winterhold., Once you visit the college, head to the Arcanaeum, which can be found as soon as you enter the college to the right, where you will see a door leading downstairs to the Arcanaeum. You will need to locate Urag gro-Shub in the Arcanaeum., You can usually find Urag gro-Shub sitting on a chair at the back of the Arcanaeum reading a book. Speak with him and mention the Elder Scrolls. Urag will find you two books written about the history of the Elder Scrolls.

Urag will mention the book was written by an expert on the Elder Scrolls named Septimus Signus. He will tell you that the last known location this expert was seen at was the Septimus Signus’s Outpost.

You can avoid visiting the College of Winterhold altogether and just visit Septimus Signus’s Outpost. There is no disadvantage or change in the questline by skipping the College of Winterhold as you can visit anytime you would like., The outpost can be found just north of the college in an glacier. Once there, climb down the ladder and make your way into the single room where Septimus is located. Septimus can be seen working on a large Dwemer Box., Septimus will mention that the Elder Scroll is located deep within Blackreach, a massive underground city. Septimus will hand you an Attunement Sphere, which is required to get into Blackreach as well as a Blank Lexicon used to unlock the Elder Scroll., In order to gain entry to Blackreach, you must first head to Alftand, which is an ancient Dwemer Ruin located southwest of Winterhold. Before entering these ruins, it must be considered that the enemies within are very strong and can be difficult for weaker players. It is recommended that you are at least level 20 and have a weapon skill of 50 or greater.

When entering Alftand, you will need to travel the large glacial tunnels and follow them until you reach the Dwemer Ruins. When you come across the barred door, proceed towards the passage that heads up a ramp to the west. Continue heading north until you reach two Dwarven Spheres. You will have to kill both of them before moving on. Head through the door and up to the Dwarven Spider-infested route heading south. As you make your way through the passages, you will make your way to the Alftand Animonculory.

, Within the Animonculory, you will find Falmer nests, which you will have to fight through. When you are hidden to enemies, you will produce double the attack amount you would compared to being seen. Combining this with a bow is a fantastic way to get through this portion of Alftand., You will come across two Falmer and eventually a Dwarven Centurion. The best way to take the Dwarven Centurion out is through continuous sneak attacks with a bow. The higher your sneak skill is, the harder it will be for the Dwarven Centurion to find you. After you have dealt with the Centurion, you will come across Sulla and Umanan arguing with each other. You can either kill these two or sneak past them as they are busy arguing. After they finish arguing they will attack each other, the winner will seek to attack you.

Their argument gives you plenty of time to avoid them altogether. You won’t need to sneak around them if they are still arguing as they are completely busy. Insert the Attunement Sphere into the Dwarven Mechanism, which is located in the center of the room where Sulla and Umanan are located. This will open a stairway below in the floor and unlock the passage to Blackreach. Both Sulla and Umanan will be too busy arguing to notice what you have unlocked it!

, As soon as you enter Blackreach, head left to a Dwarven Elevator, which will lead to the surface. Once you reach the surface, you will unlock the location on your map so you can fast travel in and out of Blackreach. It is important to unlock the gate with the lever to your right, or else you won’t be able to get into Blackreach this way. Once the gate above is open, you can head back down to search for the Elder Scroll., Follow the quest marker to the Tower of Mzark. You will come across various enemies, including Falmer and Dwarven Centurions. You can either fight these beasts or sneak by. Once you reach the Tower of Mzark, you can locate the Elder Scroll inside., You can find the Oculory through the door in front of you and up the ramps to your left or right. Make your way up to the Oculory controls and insert the Blank Lexicon into the controls., The controls have the Lexicon Receptacle (where you insert your Blank Lexicon) and four positioning buttons. The two pedestals to the Receptacles left are the currently activated buttons. Press the tallest of these two pedestals until the pedestal with the blue button begins to glow. The two pedestals control the ceiling lens array. Start by pressing the tallest of these two pedestals twice until the left pedestal begins to glow. If you press this button too many times, you will have to start over. Press the newly glowing pedestal, which will make crystal lens to descend from the ceiling. This will cause a crystal to open up and reveal the Elder Scroll., As soon as you acquire the Elder Scroll, you will complete the quest leading to the next quest, Alduin’s Bane."

When facing the Frost Troll, use fire weapons, as the Troll has a weakness to this type. Using fire magic or a weapon which has a fire bonus will inflict much more damage on the troll.
Other enemies you come across should be dealt like any other. Bring along health potions and equip the best weapon you have.
If you locate these enemies before they see you while equipped with a bow, you can use a sneak attack to give your attack a 2x bonus. This will do double the damage for that one shot!

Once equipped, wait for one of the Greybeards to open the large gate. Immediately use your shout to sprint through the gate before it closes. Once completed, Arngeir will congratulate you and this will complete the quest.
