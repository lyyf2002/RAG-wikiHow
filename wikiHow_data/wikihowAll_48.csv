Know the differences in weapons.,
Learn the skills associated with each weapon type.,
Choose a weapon type.,
Craft your weapon.,
Use a grindstone.,
Loot weapons.",How to Choose the Best Weapons in Skyrim," Weapons in Skyrim range from staves to two-handed great swords. There is no right or wrong choice when it comes to weapons because the games skill versatility means that you can be a mage wielding a great axe, or a rogue with a sword and shield if you want. Some weapons are aesthetically more logical for a certain playstyle than others but because enchantments can be stripped off of one weapon and applied to another, the choice is not set in stone.;
, Where things get interesting is how the skill system works with weapons. Each weapon type has a skill tree associated with it. There are three weapon skills: Archery, One-Handed, and Two-Handed. Depending on which type of weapon you want to focus on you will want to level and receive perks for that weapon type.


Archery is best chosen if you want to use bows to do long range attacks.
One-Handed can be paired with Shields or used by a dual wielder. Using shields will add to your overall armor, and using two weapons will stack the bonuses applied from skill perks and enchantments if you take the dual wield perk.
Two-Handed is best chosen if you want to do high direct damage attacks. This bonus to damage is offset by the two hander being slower overall and making it more difficult to block attacks.

, You will want to choose your weapon type based on the way you play the game. If you are a sneaky character, dragging around a big two handed axe isn’t going to benefit you as much as a small sword or dagger. If you are a mage, going for a staff is a logical choice, but not completely necessary., By raising the smithing skill you will have the ability to craft various different weapons. These weapons are some of the best in the game and you can enchant them in anyway you wish using the enchanting skill., Using a grindstone will increase the quality of your weapons. They will then have increased stats and perform better. This is a vital part of keeping your weapons at their highest potential.

, You will find there are a lot of weapons you can buy from NPCs (Non Player Characters) or loot from bosses. Looted weapons will often be identical to the ones you can craft via smithing but occasionally you will find special weapons like Tsun’s Battleaxe which cannot be crafted. If you find a weapon that has a distinct name, keep it, as it is a unique find."

Make sure you visit a tavern located in a capital city., You will challenge Sam to a drinking contest with a chance at winning a staff. After you consume three drinks, you black out and awaken at the Temple of Dibella.

, You are greeted by a priestess named Senna who asks you to pick up a giant’s toe, a Hagraven feather, two bottles of wine, and an odd note written by Sam.


This chore can be bypassed if your speech skill is high enough. You will be able to use your speech skill before each step of the quest.

, After cleaning up the Temple of Dibella, Senna will mention Rorikstead. This small village is located in the Whiterun Hold. Upon arrival, a Redguard named Ennis will claim that you stole his goat, Gleda. You can either retrieve the goat from the giant named Grok or skip the task with a high enough speech skill. Once completed, Ennis will mention Ysolda in Whiterun.


Simply leading the goat back to Ennis is possible while avoiding the giant. However, a follower will automatically attack the giant and force you to have to slay him.

, Ysolda will ask you to locate a ring located in Witchmist Grove from your recently called-off wedding from the night before.

, Witchmist Grove is located south of Windhelm and north of Bonestrewn Crest. Moira can be found near her camp site.

Choose your armor type.,

Level up your smithing skill and armor skill.,
Craft your armor.,
Learn how to enchant armor.,
Gather enchanting supplies.,
Enchant your armor.",How to Choose the Best Armor in Skyrim," Skyrim is a vast open world where choices are not as straightforward in other games. While there are two types of armor you can choose from there is no right or wrong combination to choose. However, there are some distinct differences between light and heavy armor and each has its own merits and faults.Both light and heavy armor have their own skill tree associated with them. When you wear one or the other you will level up that skill and be able to put perks that will grant bonuses to wearing either heavy or light armor. You can wear both and level both at the same time, but this won’t benefit you in the long run.
Light armor’s advantages include being less noisy, taking less of a hit on your stamina drain when you sprint, and a low impact on your carry weight.
Heavy armor provides more physical protection. It is easier to craft and has more perks associated with its skill.;
, Your playstyle will drastically impact your choice in armor. Light armor allows for more movement, is quieter, and takes away less stamina. All things that are vital to a thief or assassin type character. A good way to look at it is, if you are going to be a sneaky type character, choose light armor. Otherwise, heavy armor is the way to go.

, Once you have decided which kind of character you are playing, the choice of heavy or light armor is broken down to which kind of armor within that category that you have the level to craft or find.


Armor sets that provide special bonuses if a complete set is worn can be found throughout the game. Many are found in dungeons and caves or off larger bosses. While there are too many to list, you will find many of these sets simply by playing through your quests or exploring in the world.

, Approach any smith in any town and you will be given a quest to learn how to smith. This quest will teach you the basics of smithing and how to craft your first piece of armor. The basics are gather the supplies, use the appropriate workstation to refine the supplies, use the anvil to craft your armor.

, Once you have learned how to craft armor you will need to use the smithing skill making more armor and weapons in order to level it up. The you will want to place perks in the tree until you reach the armor you want to craft. Look carefully at the skill tree at the armor types you can craft so you do not waste perks going up the tree the wrong way to get to the armor you like.

, Once you have the skill to craft the armor you want simply gather the required materials, and craft the armor. Go to any smithing area. Refine your materials. Then use the anvil to craft your new armor., Enchanting armor is pretty simple. You must have learned the enchantment you want to place by disenchanting any piece of equipment with that enchantment on it. You must have a filled soul gem, and use it to enchant your armor at any enchanting station. These can be found in most cities.

, The primary thing you will need when enchanting your new armor is a filled soul gem. You can purchase these from NPC (Non Player Character) merchants or you can use the Conjuration spell “Soul Trap.” You can also get them from mining or as drops in dungeons from mage-like enemies. You will also need armor that has no previous enchantment on it.

, Once you have gathered all the materials and have gained knowledge of the enchantment you want to place on your armor, go to an enchantment station and use it. You will then select your armor piece, the enchantment, and the soul gem. Once selected you will be able to enchant that armor piece.

, Here, you’ll find an Argonian (reptile) woman named Wujeeta.

, She will tell you that she’s sick. Simply give her some potion and force out some information from her about who’s selling the Skooma, either by Persuasion, Intimidation, or Bribery.

Cure your vampirism with the console (PC only).",How to Become a Vampire in Skyrim," This is the disease that will eventually lead to vampirism. You can contract the disease by getting attacked by vampire enemies. Physical vampiric weapons and the spell ""Vampiric Drain"" both have a 10% chance of transmitting the disease each time you are attacked.


Morvarth’s Lair is one of the easiest place to contract Sanguinare Vampiris, as the opening area of the cave has several low-level vampires. You will be able to take several hits before dying, giving you a greater chance to get infected. Other locations include Bloodlet Throne, Haemar's Shame, Fellglow Keep, and Broken Fang Cave.;
, If you are infected with Lycanthropy (werewolf), you will be immune to Sanguinare Vampiris. Hircine's Ring will also make you immune. Argonians and Wood Elves are less likely to contract it as well thanks to their natural disease resistance.

, The disease will take 72 hours in game to transform into vampirism. After this period, the player will become a vampire.


You will see messages accompanied by red flashes as you come nearer to the 72 hour deadline.
You will need to touch sunlight at least once before the game will allow you to transform into a vampire.
Sanguinare Vampires can be cured by drinking a Cure Disease potion or by praying at a shrine. Avoid doing either of these for three days.

, You can quickly become a vampire without having to contract Sanguine Vampiris by using the console to cheat. Open the console by pressing ~.


Type player.setrace playerraceracevampire and press ↵ Enter. For example, if you are a Khajit, type player.setrace khajitracevampire.

, This is an expansion for Skyrim, and is required to access the Vampire Lord perks. Dawnguard is available for all systems that Skyrim is available for. Vampire Lords have significantly different weaknesses to frost and fire compared to standard Skyrim vampirism.


Vampire Lords can transform into fearsome winged beasts. You will be able to cast Blood Magic and can unlock a variety of powerful vampiric abilities.

, After you install the Dawnguard expansion, guards and innkeepers will begin telling the players about the group of vampire hunters. This will begin the quest. You will need to travel to Fort Dawnguard, located in the southeastern corner of the map, to the east of Riften.

, After speaking to the Dawnguard, you will receive this quest, sending you to Dimhollow Crypt. Once there, you will find the vampire Serana, who asks the player to escort her to her father at Castle Volkihar.

, Take Serena to Castle Volkihar, located to the west of Solitude. Return Serana to Lord Harkon and he will offer to make the player into a Vampire Lord. This is your first chance to become a Vampire Lord, but you will have two more chances later on if you decline here.


In the quest Chasing Echoes, Serana offers to turn the player into a Vampire Lord. This is because living things cannot normally enter the Soul Cairn.
After defeating Harkon completing Kindred Judgment, the final quest in the Dawnguard questline, the player can ask Serana to make her/him into a Vampire Lord.

, If you'd rather not go through the quests to become a Vampire Lord, you can enable it by cheating through the console. Open the console by pressing ~.


If you are not a regular vampire, turn into one by using the commands at the end of the previous section first.
Enter the following command to give yourself the ability to turn into a Vampire Lord: player.addspell 300283b. Then, type player.addspell 301462a to gain access to the Vampire Lord spells.

, Every 24 hours after becoming a vampire, you will progress to the next ""Stage"" of vampirism. There are four possible stages, with increasing bonuses and negative effects. Feeding will always return you to Stage One.


Each stage will increase your resistance to Frost, but will increase your susceptibility to Fire.
The damage you take from sunlight increases each stage.
Each stage grants you access to more vampiric spells and increases your vampiric strength.
NPCs will become more hostile towards you as the stages increases, attacking you on sight at Stage Four.

, Sunlight will hurt you, especially if you are in the later stages of vampirism. Night-time travel will also help keep you out of sight of most NPCs. Make good use of your vampiric abilities to hide yourself from sight.

, If you want to avoid most of the negative effects of vampirism, you will need to feed regularly. If you are playing standard Skyrim, you can feed on sleeping people by approaching them and pressing the interaction button as if you were Pickpocketing. Another option will appear, allowing you to Feed.


If you're playing Dawnguard, you can feed on a conscious person if you cast the Vampire's Seduction spell first.
Feeding will cause witnesses to become hostile, and will incur a 40 gold bounty if you're caught.
Feeding on your spouse is one of the easier ways to manage your bloodthirst.

, If you've had enough of being a vampire, you can undertake a special quest to reverse the effects. First, ask any bartender for rumors and you will be told about Falion, who studies vampires. You can find Falion in Morthal.


Falion will inform you that vampirism can be reversed with a filled Black Soul Gem. You can fill a Black Soul Gem by casting Soul Trap on a humanoid opponent before defeating it. Falion will sell you an empty Black Soul Gem if you need one.
Turn filled Soul Gem over to Falion and he will remove your vampirism. This can be repeated as often as you'd like, as long as you have a filled Black Soul Gem.

, If you can't get to the quest and you're desperate to revert your vampirism, you can use the console to cheat and remove it instantly. Open the console by pressing ~.

Raise your Sneak skill.,
Use light armor.,
Make use of sneak attacks.,
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.,
Establish an escape route.,
Keep an eye on your surroundings.,
Invest in various perks.,
Stay undetected if you don't want to get caught.,
Join the Dark Brotherhood.",How to Be an Assassin in Skyrim," The higher your Sneak skill, the harder you are to detect and the more useful perks you can acquire. Sneaking without being detected raises the skill level, so practice often.


Use invisibility spells or potions to help you sneak successfully. For example, the Shadow Stone grants a 60 second spell of invisibility that can be used once a day.
You could also use the Thief Stone, southwest of Riverwood, which increases the speed of learning stealth skills by 20%.
Try sneaking around people who are sleeping - you're less likely to be detected!
The Sneak skill trainers are Khayla (Adept) who can be found with the travelling Khajiit Caravans, Garvey (Expert) in Markarth and Delvin Mallory (Master) at the Thieves Guild, Riften.;
, Light armor (Hide, Leather, Elven, Scale and Glass armor) is less noisy than heavy armor, making sneaking easier. Some of the best armor sets in the game for assassins are given to the Dragonborn at various stages in the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves' Guild quest lines, for example, the Nightingale Armor.


Raise your light armor skill, which increases the armor's effectiveness. You can do this by receiving damage while wearing light armor, or by using trainers or skill books.

, If you're undetected, these can cause much more damage than regular attacks. Perks in the Sneak tree, for example, Deadly Aim or Assassin's Blade, can raise the damage multiplier even higher. A bow, as a ranged weapon, is perhaps the best choice for a sneak attack. Poison your weapon for even higher damage.

, Always be prepared for open combat with a decent melee weapon (daggers are a great choice, as they can be used for effective stealth kills and close-up combat; swords are also useful, as is destruction magic). Always have extra potions and poisons handy.

, If you're about to attempt a kill that will have overwhelming consequences, find the quickest way to get out of the area before you kill your target.

, Guards or witnesses could turn around corners at any second, and certain pathways or hard-to-reach areas may be helpful. Know who and what is around your character, and take advantage of things like high rock outcroppings above your target or access to a rooftop.

, The Sneak, Light Armor, Archery, One-Handed, Lockpicking, and optionally some schools of magic should be your main skills. Perks for these skills will be very useful.

, If you see the eye icon (which indicates whether NPCs are aware of you) open slowly, freeze. When the eye stops opening, quietly sneak into the shadows.

, The quests will allow you to practice your skills and technique and the rewards are well-suited for an assassin character build. Speak to Aventus Aretino in Windhelm to get started.

Progress through the Epilogue.",How to Beat Skyrim," This is the first mission you’ll encounter at the very start of the game. The mission will open up with you being a prisoner and Alduin suddenly attacking the village of Helgen where you’re at.


To complete this mission, all you need to do is to head to the exit of the village and go down the mountain path.;
, This is the second mission following the main storyline. All you need to do is to head for Whiterun and talk to Jarl Balgruuf residing inside the keep at the very back of the village.


Open your map to see where Whiterun is and what roads you can take from your location.

, This is where you’ll learn your first dragon word. You’ll need to go inside the Bleak Falls Barrow, a ruin located north of Whiterun. Head inside and follow the path where it leads to a dragon wall where you can learn your first shout.

, This is where you kill your first dragon. Jarl Balgruuf will ask you to kill the dragon that’s been terrorizing the fields near Whiterun. After talking to the Jarl, exit the village and head west towards the Western Watchtower. Here you’ll find the dragon flying above the sky.


Approach the dragon and start shooting it with arrows or spells like firebolt. Once it accumulates enough damage, Mirmulnir (the name of the dragon) will land and start biting or breathing fire at you.
Once Mirmulnir lands, go near it and attack it with your melee weapons or spell. Once it takes enough damage, it will fly up again.
Keep doing this until you defeat Mirmulnir. You’ll also use the same method to attack and defeat other dragons throughout the game.

, After killing your first dragon and telling everyone that you’re the “Dragonborn,” you’ll be given “The Way of the Voice” quest where you’ll need to go to High Hrothgar, located on a mountain top southeast section of Whiterun, and talk to the Greybeards, an order that speaks the language of dragons (in game).

, After talking to the Greybeards, they will give you your next main quest mission, “The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller,” which will require you to go Ustengrav, an ancient Nord ruin and retrieve an item called the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller.


After completing this mission, the second chapter of the main quest will begin.

, The first mission of the game’s second act will require you to travel to Riverwood, a small village in Whiterun, and head inside the “Sleeping Giant Inn.” Inside you’ll see a non-playable character named Delphine, the last of the Blades, a group of warriors that protects the Dragonborn and destroys dragons.

, Next, after talking to Delphine and working together with the Blades, you’ll be asked to go inside the Thalmor Embassy at the very north of the map and find out any information about the Thalmors, the army sent by the empire, and what they know about the dragons.

, After finding out about the dragons and the empire, the third mission of the second act of the main quest will start. In “A Cornered Rat,” all you need to do is to go to Riften, a town situated southeast of the map, and talk to the other members of the Blade inside the Ratway.


The Ratway’s main entrance can be found on the southernmost lower level of Riften.

, The Blades will then escort you to the Sky Haven Temple on the westernmost area of the map, the ancient base of the Blades and where Alduin’s Wall is located—which you need to read in order to complete the quest.

, After reading Alduin’s Wall, you will now need to speak with the leader of the Greybeards—a dragon named Paarthurnax. You can find Paarthurnax on “The Throat of the World” (the same name as the quest), the mountain top south of Whiterun (where the Greybeard’s temple is). Paarthurnax will teach you how to defeat Alduin.

, Paarthurnax will tell you that you need an item called “The Elder Scrolls” to defeat Alduin. You need to find the said item, which is located inside the Alftand ruin; southwest of Winterhold. Just head inside and follow the path up to the very end of the ruin to find the item you’re looking for.

, After getting the Elder Scrolls, go back to The Throat of the World and talk again to Paarthurnax. A time hole will open where you’ll need to go inside and learn the “Dragonrend,” a dragon shout used to bring down dragons in flight.


After you learn the shout, Alduin will appear and you’ll need to fight him. Bring down Alduin with the newly learned “Dragonrend” and attack him while his down. After taking enough damage, Alduin will fly away, completing the quest.

, To defeat Alduin, you’ll need the full cooperation of every army in Skyrim. Thus, the “Season Unending” quest will require you to establish a truce between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloak army—two factions that hold control of cities in the game map.


To do this, the Grey beards will simply set a meeting between the two parties, which you’ll need to attend.

, In order to defeat Alduin, you need to get to him first. You’ll need to capture a dragon that will take you to “Sovngarde”—the fictional “afterlife” area in the world of Skyrim.


Both the Imperial Legion and Stormcloaks will arrange the trap for you. All you need to do is to wait for the dragon to appear, attack it until it gets weak enough for the traps to capture.
You’ll be talking to Odahviing (the dragon) after you’ve captured it to make arrangements and agree to take you to Sovngarde.

, After capturing Odahviing, he’ll now take you to Sovngarde. Get on the back of dragon and it will fly up, taking you to your destination.

, After you’ve landed in Sovngarde, head inside the Hall of Heroes and talk to Gormlaith Golden-Hilt, Hakon One-Eye, and Felldir the Old—the three ancient warriors who defeated Alduin. You will be enlisting them and they’ll be joining you in battling Alduin.

, Exit the Halls of Heroes, head down the path and use your dragon shout to clear out the mist, after which Alduin will come and the final battle will begin.


To defeat Alduin, simply repeat the things you did in “Alduin’s Bane.” This should be a lot easier since the three heroes will also be there fighting on your side. They can also use dragon shouts.

, After defeating Alduin, talk to Tsun standing near the Hall of Heroes and he will take you back to Skyrim.


Congratulations! You’ve just beaten Skyrim!

If you already have it, proceed to the next section. Depending on which platform you play Skyrim on, there are a few different ways of acquiring the DLC. If you have the Legendary edition of Skyrim, Hearthfire will be available for you to install on the Start screen. If you do not have the Legendary edition, you can purchase the Hearthfire DLC at online game stores. Prices will vary depending on the store, but it’s usually around $5.

Once you have purchased the DLC, start up the game as you usually would. At the Start menu, select “Options” and then “Downloadable content.” Enter the digital code, and the DLC will begin to download. Once completed, the content will automatically be added to your game.;
, If you’re playing on the PC, you can either purchase the Legendary edition or buy the Hearthfire DLC on Steam. If you’re playing the Legendary edition, Hearthfire will be preinstalled onto the game, and you won’t have to do anything to add it., Once Hearthfire has been successfully been installed and you’ve started the game, choose the first plot of land (there are 3) where you want to build. The first plot you can purchase is where you can build Heljarchen Hall, which is located in the Pale. This plot of land is nestled in the snowy mountainside of Skyrim and is the only area that allows you to build a balcony attached to your house. Although the scenery is beautiful, the occasional wolf may attack if you’re walking around outside., The second area is the base for Lakeview Manor, in Falkreath Hold. This plot of land overlooks a gorgeous lake and is surrounded by green pine trees and the mountainside. This is the only piece of property that allows you to build an apiary, allowing you to harvest your own honey.

* You will need to have an upgraded Mega Ring in order to find these Mega Stones. Hidden stones can only be found between 8-9 PM. The ground will sparkle when there is a Mega Stone hidden there.
, In order to Mega Evolve, the Pokémon must be holding its Mega Stone., You can only Mega Evolve during battles, and only one of your Pokémon can Mega Evolve per battle. The Pokémon will stay in its Mega form until the battle is over or it faints. It will stay in its form if you switch it out during battle."

Start off with a Pokémon.,
Use mostly the same rules for your second Pokémon.,
Build up your team further.,
Build on your strengths and balance your weaknesses.,
Make a few more adjustments due to what this guide says.",How to Make a Good Pokémon X and Y Rarely Used (RU) Team," There are many Pokémon in RU, some more viable than others. Either decide to build your team around 1 Pokémon, or use a certain role (Different roles are a good thing to use when actually building the team around 1 Pokémon).;
, However, after you have decided your first Pokémon, you can always make a core (pair which helps each other by making up for the other's weaknesses) between this and your second Pokémon.

, The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Pokémon apply the same. However, you should probably apply a lead (a Pokémon that sets up entry hazards/or is intended to provide support for certain Pokémon in the first turn), an anti-lead (Pokémon that intends to stop lead Pokémon from doing their ""job""), and a wall (very defensive, can take hits) or a tank (similar, but can dish out more damage) as well as a hard hitter.

, Once you have six Pokémon, look at any glaring weaknesses your team has (type disadvantages, getting walled by a certain Pokémon, getting defeated by a certain Pokémon). Then, find ways to get past said weaknesses. This includes replacing Pokémon and putting necessary moves on certain Pokémon to get past weaknesses.

, Then start laddering and battling!

, If you want your Pokémon to be able to Mega Evolve, it will need to be holding its Mega Stone. You can't do this during battle, so make sure that you've equipped it beforehand., This will cause your Pokémon to perform its Mega evolution. If you have multiple Pokémon that can Mega Evolve, only one is able to per battle. The Pokémon will stay in its Mega form until you have finished the battle or until it is knocked out. You can switch the Pokémon out and then back without having to go through the Mega evolution again."

Finish the game.,
Head to Lumiose City, then go to the station.,

",How to Have Fun on Pokémon X or Y," This is an obvious one, of course! Don't think the game is finished after you've beaten Team Flare! Head to the eighth city Gym, then head to the Pokémon League to challenge the Elite Four and Diantha. Make sure you have lots of Max Potions, Max Ethers and Revives with you!;
, There, Professor Sycamore can give you to the pass to Kiloude City. In that city, some of the main attractions include the Friend Safari, a special place where you can catch Pokémon of the same species that belong to your friend, and Battle Maison, where you can earn rewards for battling and buy items.

, Go to the cave at Pokémon Village, which should have been blocked before, and Mewtwo will be there, ready to be caught. Watch out! Mewtwo is level 70, so you'll need some fairly strong (but not too strong) Pokémon with you.

, If you chose Fennekin, you'll be able to catch the electric legendary, if you chose Chespin, you'll be able to get the water legendary and if you chose Froakie, you'll be able to get the fire legendary. Walk to somewhere you can encounter wild Pokémon and the legendary bird will appear, but flee before you can make a move. Use the Pokedex to track down where the bird has fled, and as quickly as you can, without using Fly, head to that place and encounter them again. Once you've done this several times, the bird will surrender to the Sea Spirit's Den. Head there and you can battle and catch it. Watch out! The legendary birds are level 70, so you'll need some fairly strong (but not too strong) Pokémon with you.

, You can find Zygarde in Terminus Cave. Watch out! Zygarde is level 70, so you'll need some fairly strong (but not too strong) Pokémon with you.

, It'll take a lot of hard work, but it's very rewarding when you finally get your paws on the glimmering, rare creature. Add some style to your team!

, It's next to impossible, so that is why you'll still be playing a lot.

Choose a Pokémon to breed for.,
Make sure you will get eggs.,
Get a foreign Parent.,
Take your Pokémon to the Day Care.",How to Get Shiny Pokémon in Pokémon X and Y," You should probably visit websites like Bulbapedia or Pokedb.net to see what a Pokémon's shiny counterpart looks like. Some Pokémon are completely different in shiny form such as Charizard, Lapras, and Beldum, but be aware some shines look very the same. Such as Glalie, who's eyes are red instead of blue or Garchomp who's just a shade lighter. Many Pokémon aren't that much different, which is why planning ahead is a good idea to avoid disappointment. For this article will be using an American Munna and Japanese Ditto to breed for a shiny Munna.;
, The parents must be in the same egg groups. They also both have to be opposite genders or else you won't get an egg. So for example a female Mienshao and a male Meowth will produce an egg because they are in the same egg group. But a female Mienshao and a female Mienshao will not. Also, a female Clefairy and male Vulpix will not produce an egg. If the Pokémon you want to breed is genderless then breed it with a ditto. Dittos will breed with any Pokémon in any egg group (Except Undiscovered) regardless of the gender because ditto is in it's own egg group. Dittos also come in handy when you only have one parent. To get a ditto you can either trade for one, find them in normal friend safari, or in the Pokémon Village.

, For the Masuda method to work each parents have to be from a different region. To know if your Pokémon is from a different region look on it's summary page. On the same line as the Name and Level, on the right side there may be a black box with an abbreviation like, ""JPN,"" ""FRE,"" ""SPA"" or ""GER."" (These are not all, just a few examples.) If there is no abbreviation then the Pokémon was caught/breed in your region. To find foreign Pokémon you can search the species on GTS. You can also find PLENTY of foreign Pokémon on wonder trade. So once you find your parents then it is time to put them in the day care!

, Located on Route 7, you can drop off two Pokémon and ride around until they produce an egg. To know if there is an egg, the guy standing outside will face outward, if there is no egg he will have his back to you. When you see him facing out talk to him and he will ask if you want the egg after you say yes you can either put it in your PC or bike around and hatch it. Some people like to fill up a couple PC boxes of egg to hatch later, some take a party full to Lumiose City to bike around the Prism Tower or you can just ride up and down Route 7 hatching and collecting eggs. So just keep hatching and collecting and eventually you will get a shiny!

Since Pokémon eggs take time and steps to hatch, you can get Poké Miles and new Pokémon at the same time!, In Pokémon X and Y, there is a loop around Prism Tower in Lumiose City.

, In order to evolve, Tyrunt must level up during the day. This can be Level 39, or any level after that. Daytime counts both Morning and Day, so you can perform this evolution anytime between 4 AM and 8 PM.Changing your system's clock to make daytime occur will prevent any time-based evolutions for 24 hours.

Let the evolution complete.",How to Get a Goodra in Pokémon X and Y," Goomy is the first evolutionary form of Goodra. The only place in X and Y where you can catch one in the wild is on Route 14.Route 14 is located in Northern Kalos, between Lumiose City and Laverre City. It is also called the Laverre Nature Trail.Your best bet for encountering a Goomy is to get into battles in the swampy areas of Route 14, where a Goomy has a 20% chance of appearing per encounter. In other parts of the area, they can appear 10% of the time or not at all.As a Dragon-type Pokémon, Goomy is weak against Ice, Dragon, and Fairy attacks. It is resistant to Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric.;
, Once you capture a Goomy, add it to your party and start to battle with it. It will evolve into Sliggoo at level 40. The best way to evolve it quickly is to give it lots of rare candies, though this is an expensive option.


If you don't want to fight with your Goomy, you can use the Exp. Share item to have it receive experience from fights it doesn't participate in. This item is given by Alexa in Satalune City., While catching a Goomy and evolving it manually is usually the easiest option, you also have the option of starting with the second evolutionary form. The only normal area in the game where a Sliggoo can be found is Route 19. This area is in Eastern Kalos between Couriway Town and Snowbelle City.Your best bet for finding a Sliggoo is to get into battles in the yellow flowers. Sliggoos have a 20% chance of appearing per encounter here.You can also catch a Sliggoo in the Friend Safari (on a Dragon-Type Safari). Sliggoos have a 50% chance of appearing in Slot 3.See our Friend Safari article for more information.

, Whether you catch your Sliggoo in the wild or evolve it from a Goomy, this step is the same. Continue to battle with your Sliggoo (or use rare candies) to get it to level 49. Battle a few more times to get to the point where another battle will level it up.


If the Sliggoo is already over level 49, just get it to the point that it will evolve to the next level after a successful battle or two.

, Unfortunately, there are no areas that are permanently rainy. The ""raining"" area status is partly random. However, there are areas where rain is more likely than usual. These include Route 14 and Route 19 — the places where you can catch a Goomy and Sliggoo, respectively.


Any rainy area will work. If you notice that it's raining in an area other than Route 14 or 19, feel free to proceed.

, It doesn't matter who or what you fight — you just want to get into a battle and use your Sliggoo. Ideally, however, the fight should be difficult enough that the experience will make your Sliggoo level up (otherwise you may need to fight again to get to the next level).


Be sure to use your Sliggoo during the fight. If you don't, it won't gain experience unless you're using an Exp. Share item.

, All that's required is for you to win the fight. If you're fighting a wild Pokémon, you can make it faint or catch it. If you're fighting another trainer, just make it faint.

, After you win the fight, if you got enough experience to level up, your Sliggoo will reach level 50 and immediately start evolving. Enjoy your new Goodra!


If your Sliggoo didn't evolve, make sure you met the requirements for evolution:



The Sliggoo must reach level 50 (or any higher level) from the fight.
The fight that caused the level up must have been in an area with rain.

Have a good Pokémon team.,
Be prepared.,
Know the Elite Four.,
Defeat Malva.,
Defeat Wikstrom.,
Defeat Siebold.,
Defeat Drasna.,
Approach the Champion.",How to Defeat the Elite 4 in Pokémon X and Y," It's best to have your team at around Level 60 or higher, as well as a good variety of types. Having a Fairy-type Pokémon, such as Xerneas in Pokémon X, is a good idea for the battles, as well as at least one Pokémon that can Mega Evolve.


Have your team full. The less Pokémon you have, the more chance you have of losing if your Pokémon get knocked out.
Make sure your team is all roughly the same level. You may have a Grass-type Pokémon in your party, but if it's only level 12, it's not going to make much of a dent before it gets knocked out. The Experience Share usually helps with this, but make sure you train up all lower-level Pokémon on Victory Road.;
, Before getting to the Elite Four, make sure you stock up on the Potions you'll need, status healers, and revives. You can buy them before going on Victory Road, or you can get them at the Pokémon League after getting through Victory Road.


It's best to stick with getting Full Heals as opposed to just one of each type. It'll cost you less money and you can stock up more.
Hyper Potions will work in a pinch, but the best potion to use is the Max Potion, as it will fully heal your Pokémon regardless of how much HP it has.
It's best to buy more of each medication than you think you'll need. While it can be a little costly, you'll be grateful when your most trusted Pokémon keeps fainting or losing HP too quickly.

, The four members use different types. You can defeat them in any order you want.


Malva is a Fire-type user.
Wikstrom specializes in Steel-type Pokémon.
Siebold utilizes Water-type Pokémon.
Drasna's Pokémon consist of Dragon-types.

, The best way of defeating Malva is to use Water-types, but Ground-type or Rock-type Pokémon will work as well. Be wary of her Chandelure, as it's part Ghost-type and has a tendency to use Confusion.

, Fire-type Pokémon is the best way to fight his Steel-types, though you can also use Ground or Fighting-types.

, His Pokémon are all at least part Water-types, so you can defeat him using Electric-type and Grass-type. Be careful when using an Electric-type Pokémon on Gyarados, though - it knows Earthquake.

, Her Pokémon are Dragon-types, so the best way to defeat her is to use Ice-types, Dragon-types, and Fairy-types. If you have Pokémon X, using Xerneas can help a lot, as Xerneas is Fairy-type. However, if you have Pokémon Y, Yveltal is not a Fairy-type, so you'll have to find another way of defeating her.

, If you've defeated all of the Elite Four members, you're ready to take on the Champion! Be aware that for the Champion, you'll need to use your own mix of types and moves to defeat them - as well as a lot of Revives.

Start the trading process.,
Trade the Magneton from the HeartGold/SoulSilver player.,
Have the Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum player evolve Magneton at Mt.,
Trade the evolved Magnezone back to the HeartGold/SoulSilver player.",How to Evolve Magneton," Magneton can be any level when it evolves. It is not possible to evolve Magneton in Blue, Red, Yellow, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, HeartGold, or SoulSilver.

You can evolve a Magnemite into a Magneton by raising it to level 30, or you can catch Magnetons at various locations in your game.
Magneton will need to be level 99 or lower. Level 100 Pokémon cannot evolve, since evolving happens during the level up process and 100 is the max.
If you're playing HeartGold or SoulSilver, you can get a Magnezone by trading to Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum, evolving it in that game, and then trading it back. See the next section for details.;
, Magneton only evolves in specific locations depending on the game you are playing:Diamond, Pearl, Platinum - Visit Mt. Coronet. This mountain is located in the center of the Sinnoh region, and can be accessed from Snowpoint City, Hearthome City, Eterna City, Celestic Town, and Oreburgh City.

Black, White, Black 2, White 2 - Visit Chargestone Cave. You can enter the cave from Route 6 or Mistralton City. In Black and White, you'll need to beat the Driftveil Gym first.

X, Y - Visit Kalos Route 13. This can be found in the northern area of the map, connecting Coumarine City and Lumiose City.

Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire - Visit New Mauville. This location is underneath Mauville City, and can be accessed by Surfing from Route 110 underneath the bridge.

, Once you're in the right spot, Magneton will evolve when it levels up. You can level up by fighting wild Pokémon and trainers, or by using a Rare Candy., The only way to get a Magnezone in HeartGold and SoulSilver is to trade it to Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum, evolve it, then trade it back to HeartGold or SoulSilver.Both systems will need to be physically nearby in order to trade. Internet trades are no longer possible in these games., Each player will need to have the Pokedex and at least two Pokémon., You can start the trade from any Pokémon Center in the game., This is the trading area., Once you're both in a Pokémon Center, you can begin trading.:

Talk to the person in the center of the room on the second floor. When you agree, you'll be taken to the trading room. Both players need to do this.
Enable DS Wireless Communication when prompted. Both players will be prompted for this. DS Wireless Communication needs to be enabled in order to connect for the trade.
Talk to the other player and select ""Trade."" This will begin the trade process.

, Trade this to the person playing Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum., Coronet. The player will need to take the Magneton to Mt. Coronet and then level it up to evolve it. This can be done by battling or by using a Rare Candy. The Magneton will evolve into a Magnezone., Follow the same trading process above to trade the Pokémon back. The HeartGold/SoulSilver player now has a Magnezone when it would normally not be possible."

Find a Honedge in Route Six.,
Catch the Honedge.,
Train the Honedge to Level 35.,
Allow it to evolve.",How to Evolve Honedge1," If you don't already have a Honedge, don't worry — they're not especially hard to find in Pokémon X and Y. You'll want to look in Route Six, which is the area connecting Route Seven to the Parfum Palace.Route Six is marked by two rows of shade trees along the sides of a central path. However, to find Honedge, you need to get to the tall grass behind the trees, which means entering the palace grounds and immediately exiting through one of the side paths.


Note that Honedges appear approximately 15% of the time in the tall grass. You will probably have to fight a handful of Oddishes and Sentrets before you encounter a Honedge.It's also possible to get Honedge in Alpha Sapphire/Omega Ruby. However, this can only be done through trading. You can't catch Honedge in the wild in these games.;
, There isn't a special strategy to catching the Honedges in Route Six. Once you get into a fight with one, get it down to a low HP level (without making it faint) and throw your best Pokéball at it. The Honedges you will encounter will be about level 11 or 12, so the fight shouldn't be too difficult. However, here are some things you may want to know:Honedges are extra-weak versus ghost, fire, ground, and dark type attacks.
Honedges are immune to normal, fighting, and poison type attacks.
Honedges take normal damage from water and electric type attacks.
Honedges take reduced damage from every other type.

, There's nothing out-of-the ordinary about the way you must level up your Honedge — just keep training it slowly and steadily. Since you'll catch your Honedge at about level 11 or 12, you have about 23 or 24 levels to gain until it will evolve. This can take some time, but it will be a little faster if you use experience-boosting items like:



Exp. Share: This item gives experience to all the Pokémon in your party — not just the ones that participate in the battle. You can get the Exp. Share from Alexa in Santalune City after defeating Viola.Lucky Egg: The Pokémon that holds this item will receive 150% of the normal experience it would get from battle. You can find the Lucky Egg several places:You can show the girl in the girl in the Coumarine City hotel lobby a Pokémon with a high friendship level
You can get it from beating Graffiti Eraser level two in the PokéMileage Club.f
You can get it from wild Chanseys in the Friend Safari





, Once you get your Honedge to level 35, it will start to evolve into Doublade. There aren't any time or item requirements to get it to evolve — evolution should happen automatically.

"
Find a Dusk Stone in Terminus Cave.,
Alternatively, get the Dusk Stone from Secret Super Training.,
Use another option for getting a Dusk Stone.,
Use the Dusk Stone on Doublade.",How to Evolve Honedge2," Evolving your new Doublade into its final form, Aegislash, can't be done through normal training. Instead, you must use a special evolutionary item called a ""Dusk Stone"" to get it to evolve. There are a few places in the game to get this stone. The most straightforward is to simply find it in Terminus Cave (accessible from Route 18).Note that you can't get to Route 18 until you defeat Team Flare and Lysandre at their HQ in Geosenge town, so you'll need to do this before you can get to the cave and find the Dusk Stone.
Inside the cave, the Dusk Stone can be found on the second basement level to the far left of the map. It is to the left of an Iron item on a stalactite., Another straightforward way to get a Dusk Stone is through the Secret Super Training minigame. The level you must beat is level six, ""Watch Out! That's One Tricky Second Half!"" Defeating the Aegislash balloon bot wins you an item as a prize — the Dusk Stone is one of five possible prizes for this level.You can access the training minigames at any time via the bottom screen of the 3DS.It is to the left of the Player Search System and to the right of Pokémon-Amie.
Keep in mind that only fully-trained Pokémon are eligible for Secret Super Training.
Beating the target time as quickly as possible gives you a better chance for a rare item like a Dusk Stone.

, There are a few other ways to get a Dusk Stone in Pokémon X and Y. These aren't typically as convenient as the options above, but they are worth mentioning:


You can get a Dusk Stone from beating Balloon Popping level three in the PokéMileage Club.
You can get a Dusk Stone by beating the Psychic ""Inver"" trainer on Route 18 with a score of 7-9. In these battles, Pokémon type strengths and weaknesses are reversed. Your score is the number of ""It's super effective"" hits you make minus the number of ""it's not very effective"" hits. The Dusk Stone is one of ten possible prizes for scores of 7-9 (all are evolutionary stones).
You can get a Dusk Stone by beating a Team Flare Grunt in Laverre City. However, this is only after beating the Elite Four.

, Once you have a Dusk Stone, evolving Doublade is easy. Just use the item on Doublade and the evolution sequence will begin. Congratulations — you now have an Aegislash!


This will consume the Dusk Stone, so think carefully before you use this rare item.
There is no level requirement to evolve Doublade this way, but you may want to hold off on evolving yours until it's learned all of the moves you want, as Douslash can learn moves through leveling up that Aegislash can't. Click here for a link to a page with all of Doublade's move possibilities.

Make sure you have the requirements met before you begin:

The Champion is beaten and you have access to Kiloude City (Required)
You have the Destiny Knot item (Required)
You have the Everstone item (Required)
You have all of the “Power” items (Band, Lens, etc.),
Choose your Pokémon.,
Choose your type of Pokémon.,
Choose your Pokémon's Nature.,
Choose your Pokémon's Egg-Moves.,
Catch about 12 of your chosen Pokémon from one of your friend safaris.,
Determine your boxed Pokémon’s IVs.,
Once you have determined your Pokémon’s IVs, put them in the PC and use the “Marking” to label which perfect IVs the Pokémon has.,
Start breeding.,
Before really getting into the IV breeding, we first need to add the egg move in.,
Put both Pokémon in the daycare on Route 7 and begin to bike around.,
To efficiently hatch all of the eggs, put a paper clip under the joystick of your 3DS and set yourself to constantly move in a circle around the tower.,
Grab another Pokémon from the box of friend safari Pokémon that has opposite IVs as your new baby.,
Once you have a baby with a combination of perfect IVs, use that one to breed so that you can increase your chances of getting perfect IVs.,
Continue to breed, combining multiple IVs and using power items to expedite it.,
Put the two babies in the daycare with a destiny knot and a power item corresponding to any IV.,
Breed the two Pokémon until you get a baby with your desired nature, egg moves, IVs, and Ability.,
Use Vitamins to raise your EVs by 10 each.,
Use Wings for fine tuning.,If you still need more EVs, choose one of the other two methods,
Use Punching Bags in Super Training by selecting specific statistic bag and tapping the screen to have your Pokémon hit the bag.,
Try the Soccer Challenge.,
Use this handy chart to determine which Pokémon you should battle in order to gain the specific EVs.

,
Go to the area, use sweet scent with one of your party Pokémon to instantly encounter a horde, and begin to battle with your Pokémon you plan to train.,
After battling enough hordes, you will max out your EVs.,
Wait for your full training to finish.,
Once you are done EV training, teach your Pokémon your desired moves through either level up or TM and you are completely finished!

",How to Create the Perfect Pokémon in Pokémon X and Y," (Recommended)
You have a lot of time on your hands. IV breeding tends to take a while (it can be picked back up whenever, though).;
, When you first get started with IV breeding (which will come up later in these instructions), it is recommended that you begin with a Pokémon found in one of your Friend Safaris (located in Kiloude City). In our example, we will choose Probopass (As Nosepass in the Friend Safari).

, The move-set and the natures are very important. To view the move-set of a Pokémon, go to www.serebii.net and look for your Pokémon in the XY Pokédex. You can select any level up moves, TM moves, or egg-moves. The move-set we will choose after reviewing the available ones for Probopass will be Stealth Rock, Power Gem, Discharge, and Explosion.

, To choose your Pokémon’s nature, you should look at its stats and determine what you would like to make better, and what can be lowered. The Serebii Pokédex is very helpful for this as well. For our Probopass example, you can see it has lower Speed, so we will not want to use that stat. We choose the nature “Brave” from the list provided here to lower Speed and increase its Attack in order to make it more of a tank.

, To get the egg-moves of a Pokémon, select the “details” link to see what parents in the Pokémon’s egg-group can give that move to your Pokémon. You must obtain that parent with the move and breed it with your Pokémon later. Stealth Rock is an egg-move for Probopass, so we will get an Onix that knows Stealth Rock.

, This will be helpful for the next section.

, Go to the Pokémon Center in Kiloude City and bring 6 of your new Pokémon to the man in the corner of the room. He will tell you which perfect IVs your Pokémon have. He will first judge your Pokémon’s potential with different descriptors, with “Outstanding” being the best. He will then go on to state which stats have the best IVs. If he ends the conversation with “Stats like those… They simply can’t be beaten!” It means each stat mentioned is perfect. Pokémon captured in the Friend Safari always have at least two perfect IVs.

, The labels go in order of HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. This Nosepass has 2 perfect IVs, one in Attack and one in Defense, signified by the Triangle and Square.

, This is where the Destiny Knot comes in handy. Choose the IVs that you would like to pass down. It is the most convenient to have only 5 perfect IVs because of how the Destiny Knot works. Because of Probopass’ ridiculously low speed, we will plan to have perfect IVs in everything except that., Give the destiny knot to a male Pokémon knowing the egg move, and give a power item corresponding to a perfect IV of a female of your Pokémon. We will attach destiny knot to an Onix with stealth rock, and we will give the Nosepass from earlier the power bracer to pass down attack., The more you move the more eggs you will get. Grab 5 eggs and take them to the center of Lumiose City.

, Egg hatching is determined by steps, so as you are going around the circle, your eggs will hatch. Once all of your eggs are hatched, fly back to Kiloude and figure out the IVs of your new Pokémon and label them like earlier. Once you have the same IVs as the mother Pokémon on one of the babies, you are done with egg move parent and you can move on to new IVs.

, Give one of them the destiny knot and the other a power item corresponding to one of their IVs. Put them in the daycare and do the same method as earlier to hatch and label them. For example, we would put our new baby Nosepass with Stealth Rock and Attack and Defense IVs holding a power bracer in with a friend safari Nosepass of the opposite gender with HP, Special Attack, and Special Defense IVs holding the destiny knot. If you do not have a Pokémon with the exact opposite IVs, use one with two opposite ones. Later, use a different friend safari Pokémon to add in the remaining IV (Explained in the next step)., For example, if we come up with a baby Nosepass with Attack, Defense, and Special Attack; we substitute that one with the original one in order to get Special Attack easier., You will go through dozens of Pokémon or just a few, determined only by luck. Once you have two Pokémon of the opposite gender with 5 of your selected perfect IVs and egg moves, you are done with the hard part and heading onto the natures., Constantly breed them until you come up with a baby that has your selected nature. It does not matter if the Pokémon does not have the 5 desired IVs. Give the Pokémon the everstone and put it in with the parent of the opposite gender. The everstone will guarantee that the nature of the holder is passed to the babies. Make sure the Destiny Knot stays in the mix! For Nosepass, we will breed until we get “Brave,” then breed that Nosepass holding the everstone with a parent holding the destiny knot., Here is our Perfect Nosepass:

, They can be bought for a price of 9,400 Pokémon dollars. Use them until you reach the desired number or to a maximum of 100. For example, if you want 84 HP EVs, use 8 HP Up then get the other 4 by the other methods below., Each wing adds one EV and is not limited by the 100 EV limit. Only use them if you have some on hand or if you have pokémiles you are willing to spend. Obtaining them can be tedious.,, Once the Pokémon has completed the exercise, they will gain EVs in that statistic. We want Probopass to be extra defensive, so we will train him with Defense and Special Defense Bags.

, The Super Training Soccer Challenge is very similar to the punching bag, except you play the mini-game and try to hit the targets with the ball. Pick a level that corresponds to a statistic and play it. Afterwards, the Pokémon will gain EVs in that statistic. We want Probopass to be extra defensive, so we will train him with Defense and Special Defense Challenges.

,, It is recommended that you level up your Pokémon first and teach it a move that hits all Pokémon (like Surf or Rockslide) so it can battle for itself. Use a reset punching bag after you level up so that you can start with zero EVs. Then you can battle the hordes., In order to test if your EVs are maxed, try a punching bag. The game will prevent you from using it if the EVs are maxed. Remember, once you max out one statistic’s EVs, it is a waste of time to continue to train it. Move on to the next stat you want to boost., Once you have done enough super training or horde battling and you try to use a bag of an EV that has not yet been maxed out, the game will prevent you from doing it, saying it will have no effect. This means you are done and you have a fully EV trained Pokémon! You can see the effect it has on your Pokémon by looking at the super training base screen. Here, Probopass is fully EV trained, specifying in Defense and Special Defense.

Turn the first system off at exactly 5 seconds.,
Exit the game on the second system.,
Find the cloned Pokémon on the second system.",How to Clone in Pokémon X/Y," In order to clone a Pokémon in X or Y, you'll need more than just your game and 3DS. Make sure you have the following, and consider asking a friend for help:


Two 3DSs (or 2DSs).
Two copies of Pokémon X or Y (They don't have to be the same game).
A timer or stopwatch.;
, This Pokémon will be lost during the cloning process, so make sure it isn't holding anything valuable or isn't a Pokémon you want to keep.

, This isn't explicitly required, but there are lots of reports of held items affecting the timing, making it difficult to make the clone happen.If you get a good feel for the timing, you can have the Pokémon hold items so that the item gets cloned as well. Try a few clones without items first to make sure you have a handle on the process.

, Make sure that your Wi-Fi is disabled so that the trade occurs over infrared.

, Accept the trade on both systems and get ready to start your stopwatch.

, This is the one that you will need to power off at a precise time in order to make the cloning occur.

, The system will inform you that you are trading away the good Pokémon, and that you will receive the Pokémon you don't care about.

, Right after receiving the Pokémon on the first system, the screen will fade to black. Start your timer.

, Make sure that you're turning off the system that is offering the Pokémon you want cloned (the one receiving the Pokémon you don't care about). As soon as the stopwatch hits 5 seconds after the screen went black, turn the power off on the first 3DS.Different guides suggest different amounts of time. Some suggest 4 seconds instead of 5, and some suggest as low as 3.5 seconds. If you can't get the cloning process to work, try fiddling with the timing.If you turn the power off on the other 3DS by accident, you'll clone the Pokémon you don't care about and lose the good one.

, You'll see a screen informing you that you'll need to power off the system to restart the game. Turn the system off, and then turn it back and start the game.

, If the process worked correctly, the first system should still have the Pokémon, and the clone will appear in one of the boxes in the second system's PC.

Get the right supplies.,
Find the best Pokémon.,
Choose your EV spread if you haven't already.,
Know what Pokémon to defeat to gain EVs, right?",How to EV Train a Pokémon in X & Y1," Before you begin training, you need some items if you want to train as fast as possible in as little time as you can. First, you want to get 10 vitamins for all stats (or just the stats you need, if you've already picked your spread).


You can get these in Laverre City's Pokémon Center. They're a bit pricey, but use some Bargain O-Powers and you should be able to afford them. Next, you need the Power items. You can get these in the Battle Maison in Kiloude City for BP. You need 16 BP for each though, so prepare to do a LOT of battling to get these.
Optionally, you can only battle enough to get the items you need for a specific Pokémon. These items are not required, but are greatly recommended as they will increase the number of EVs given per Pokémon. These are:
Power Bracer (For Attack)
Power Anklet (for Speed)
Power Weight (for HP)
Power Lens (for Special Attack)
Power Belt (for Defense)
Power Band (for Special Defense);
, After getting the items you need, you'll want a level 50-100 Pokémon that has a move that can attack multiple Pokémon like Earthquake. You'll also need a Pokémon with the disease Pokerus, which can be received over Wonder Trade or in the wild. It's not absolutely necessary, but like the Power items, they make the process go much faster.


Once you've acquired these, put the carrier of Pokerus in front of your party and turn off the Exp. Share in your Key Items. Battle a few Pokémon until the Pokémon you want to train has the disease, and you can put the carrier away in the PC and turn the Exp. Share back on.
Last but not least, you should get a Pokémon that knows Sweet Scent so you can force horde encounters.

, A good tool for EV spreads for Gens I through V is Smogon, but if you're training a Pokémon new to X/Y, you'll have to either look up EV spreads online or use Pokémon Showdown, an online battling simulator. Just go to Teambuilder, click New Team, choose the OU format and click Add Pokémon.


Type in your Pokémon and its Ability and Nature. You can fill in the moves depending on what role you'd like it to play on your team. After you do this, click the box under Stats and there should be a long button on top, which recommends a spread based on the moves you chose.
This isn't perfect, but it's definitely a good start if you're not sure. If you know what EV spread you'd like, we can move on to deciding which Pokémon to fight against.

, Each Pokémon gives a pre-determined numbers of EVs in a stat. To find the one you want to train against, go to Nugget Bridge's article on EV Training Hotspots and scroll down to Hordes. Depending on what stats you're training in, it will give which Pokémon are the best for which stat and where to find them. After choosing, head off to the spot specified.

"
"
Now that you can begin training, go to the spot where the specific Pokémon is.,
After you finish the first stat, do the exact same with your next stat.,
For the last stat, just use one vitamin to give it the EVs.",How to EV Train a Pokémon in X & Y2," Make sure the Pokémon with the move that can hit multiple Pokémon is up front, the Exp. Share is on and you have the Pokémon with Sweet Scent as well as the one you want to train.


Give the Pokémon you're training the item that is for their specific star (for example, if training Defense, give them the Power Belt). Feed them 10 vitamins in the stat you are training, which takes off the first 100 EVs.
Head into the grass/sea/cave and use Sweet Scent. This will force a horde encounter. Run away from anything that is not your specific Pokémon. Please note that EVs in X/Y cap at 252, so you don't have to worry about going over and wasting points. This is where things get pretty easy. Say you're fighting against Wingull, which give 1 Speed EV to train my Espurr. Espurr holds a Power Anklet, which increases the Speed EVs given from 1 to 5. Pokerus multiples this by 2, so it's now increased to 10 for a single Wingull. A horde of Wingull gives a whopping 50 Speed EVs with all of this. Therefore, it will only take a few encounters to max out the stat you are training.

, Feed your Pokémon the specific vitamins, go to the place where the Pokémon is that gives EVs and use Sweet Scent to force horde encounters while the Pokémon up front does the battling with the attack that hits multiple Pokémon at once. Make sure you switch Power items for the next stat! Run from anything that's not the specific Pokémon. After about 4-5 encounters or less, you should have maxed out your stat.

, Since you're already done EV training the other stats, it's okay to overcompensate. With that, you have now successfully EV trained a Pokémon! If done right, you can EV train in less than 10 minutes.

Mewtwo will be caught when the thrown Poké Ball shakes 3 times and turns dark in color.",How to Catch Mewtwo in Pokémon X and Y," Mewtwo is a level 70 Pokémon, and it knows Psychic, Aura Sphere, Barrier (raises its Defense), and Recover (restores half its HP). You will need Pokémon stronger than Mewtwo. Get a Pokémon that can Paralyze it, a Pokémon that knows Sing, or any other Pokémon that uses any other status condition. In this type of battle, you need more strategy than power. Do not use Toxic, Will O' Wisp, or any move that causes a HP-sapping status condition. This makes damage worsen every turn, and Mewtwo is going to faint quickly if you are not careful. When you are ready, advance.


Paralysis is best, since this condition makes Mewtwo slower, easier to catch, and less likely to use moves.;
, You will need to beat the Elite Four and complete the main game before you can get Mewtwo. See this guide for details on how to best build your team to take down the Elite Four.

, Mewtwo is a tough catch, and you will need a large number of Ultra Balls, Timer Balls, Dusk Balls, and/or a Master Ball (if you still have it).

, The Ultra Ball is ineffective, but 40 may work (this is not, however, guaranteed). Timer Balls are if there at least 30 turns. The Master Ball always works (with rare exceptions) - but you may need it later.

, Mewtwo is level 70, which means you're going to be in for a tough battle. Make sure that you have a party that can survive Mewtwo's attacks as well as put out enough damage to lower its health for capturing.

, You can find Mewtwo outside of Pokémon Village. Pokémon Village can only be accessed by traveling down Route 20 in Kalos.

, Walk to the left after reaching the village until you reach the edge of the river. Use Surf and travel up the river until you reach the waterfall. Jump back onto the ground on the right side of the bottom of the waterfall. Walk down the path to the right until you reach the cave.


The cave entrance will be blocked until you become the Champion, by defeating Diantha.

, Once you enter the cave, save your game. If you accidentally make it faint you can refresh. Don't worry if you leave before talking to it: It's going to stay there unless it's in a battle.

, After saving and ensuring that everyone is ready, walk up to Mewtwo and talk to it. After a short cut-scene, the battle will begin! If you are going to use your Master Ball, go ahead and dwindle its HP down.

, Psychic deals 90 damage (unless you have a Dark-type Pokémon). Barrier sharply raises its defense. Recover restores half its HP. One strategy is to make it waste all it moves or, give it the asleep or frozen status condition.

, Now that Mewtwo is nearly defeated, it's time to start chucking Poké Balls at it. Ultra Balls aren't guaranteed to work, so you'll likely have to throw quite a few before you can capture Mewtwo. If it heals himself, use your Pokémon to lower its health again before throwing more balls.

, Mewtwo is going to be a strong addition to your party when caught! You can only get one in the game, so be careful not to release this creature.

Catch an Eevee if you don't already have one.,
Teach your Eevee a Fairy-type move.,
Gain two affection hearts from Eevee in Pokémon-Amie.,
Level up.,
Avoid areas with a moss or ice rock when leveling up.",How to Evolve Eevee Into Sylveon," Because Sylveon is an evolved form of Eevee that can't be captured anywhere else in the game, you'll need an Eevee to start with. If you already have one caught, you can proceed to the next step, but if you don't, you'll need to catch one yourself.


In Pokémon X and Y, Eevees can be caught on Route 10, which is located between Geosenge Town and Cyllage City.
Eevees can also be caught in the Friend Safari, an area that uses another player's 3DS Friend Code to generate an area containing Pokémon of a single type. Because Eevee is a Normal-type, you'll need to use a Friend Code that generates a Normal-type safari.
Finally, Eevee can also be obtained from a trade with another player.;
, The first requirement for Eevee to evolve into Sylveon is that it must know at least one Fairy-type move. Unlike other Fairy-type Pokémon like Clefable, no moonstone is needed to evolve Sylveon. Eevee learns two Fairy-type moves from leveling up: Baby-doll Eyes at Level 9 and Charm at Level 29.Note that Eevee can't learn any Fairy-type moves from TMs.

, The second condition for evolution into Sylveon is that your Eevee must have at least two affection hearts for you in Pokémon-Amie. Pokémon-Amie is a feature new to Pokémon X and Y that allows players to develop a bond with their Pokémon by petting it, feeding it, playing minigames with it, and allowing it to play with other Pokémon on your team. Don't worry, this feature is also available in Pokémon ORAS; you can find it in the PlayNav.


Pamper your Eevee in Pokémon-Amie until it has at least two Affection hearts before proceeding. You can do this either before or after you've taught it a Fairy-type move. Make sure you only get 2-3 hearts, because maxing out Eevee's affection may cause it to evolve into Espeon or Umbreon.

, Once your Eevee has at least two Affection hearts and knows a Fairy-type move, level it up. You can do this through random battles, fights with other trainers, and so on. Once your Eevee levels up, assuming the conditions above have been met, it should immediately evolve into Sylveon. Congratulations!

, While leveling your Eevee up in the vast majority of the areas of the game will cause it to evolve into a Sylveon once the conditions above are met, there are several important exceptions that you'll want to be aware of. Failing to observe these exceptions can cause your Eevee to evolve into an undesired form! Two of Eevee's evolved forms, Leafeon and Glaceon, require you to level up the Eevee near a moss rock or an ice rock respectively to achieve the evolution. If you level up your Eevee near either of these, it will evolve into one of the other forms no matter whether or not you met the conditions for Sylveon above. In Pokémon X and Y, the spots to avoid are:


Route 20, which contains a moss rock.Frost Cavern, which contains an ice rock."

(On the PC) bring up the console by hitting the tilde ~ key.,
Type in your desired code and hit Enter.",How to Use Console Cheats Effectively in Oblivion,";
, Some useful codes are:


Player.additem (X) (#) - replace the (X) with the desired item code and the (#) with the quantity, and the item(s) will appear in your inventory. Complete lists of item codes can be found on the internet. For example, the code for gold is 0000000F, so entering ""player.additem 0000000F 100"" would add 100 more gold to your inventory; this is a cheat which can potentially be used to obtain unlimited gold. ""Player.removeitem"" can be used to reverse this.






Player.addspell (X) - this is a similar code but with adding spells to your spellbook.
Movetoqt - an essential for the impatient gamer, it instantly transports the character to the quest marker - making the game go a lot faster.
Kill - when an object is selected (by clicking on it in the console), it will die instantly.
Unlock - this will unlock any locked, selected object, no matter the lock rating.
Lock (X) - this will in turn lock any object. The number corresponds to the strength of the lock, i.e. 100 being the strongest lock.
TLC - a slightly strange command, this toggles all collisions for the selected object (or yourself, if none is selected). This means that you can literally walk through walls, NPC's and even beneath the floor and up into the sky of the game world. Although using this too much can crash the game, it is good for reaching hard-to-reach places, or help if you get stuck in a wall etc. (which can sometimes happen using 'movetoqt').
Setscale - This will resize the object you have selected, so e.g. ""setscale 2"" will double the size of the object. Sizes can go from 0.5 to 2.1, 1 being the original size. This can be very useful when roleplaying and can also be used on your character for some comedic effect.
SetPCFame (X) - This will set the player's fame to the specified amount. This can be quite advantageous when you need a certain fame level for a particular quest, etc.
SetPCInfamy (X) - As above, this will set the player's infamy to the specified amount. These two are useful in meeting the requirements for quests, doomstones or for using altars.
Player.setcrimegold (X)- This will change your bounty to the amount entered. However, if you did previously have a bounty a guard will still chase you, but when he reaches you he will only initiate a standard conversation and then leave, instead of the ""Pay Gold"", ""Go to Jail"" or ""Resist Arrest"" options.
Modpcs skill (X) - This will add X points to the desired skill, e.g. ""modpcs blade 10"" will add 10 more points to your Blade skill. This can be used to increase your skills in the game beyond what is normally possible.
Modpca attribute (X) - In a similar way, this adds X points to the desired attribute.
Player.setlevel (X) - This sets the level of the player to the specified number. (It will not give you any of the perks that come with leveling up, however). This is useful when you are doing a quest with a leveled reward (If you have a higher level you get a better reward) and when encountering leveled monsters (Lower levels mean easier kills).
Advlevel - This forces the normal level up screen, so you will be able to pick some of the perks that come with leveling up and also gain a level.
Showclassmenu - This allows you to change your class without being in character creation or about to exit the tutorial. This can have some weird impacts on your skill set however, as you'll get the skill bonuses from the class you originally picked and your new class.
Showbirthsignmenu - This works in the same way, opening up the birthsign menu.

Choose your skills.,
Level up.,
Prepare for awesomeness.,
Max out your character.",How to Reach Higher Levels in The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion," When choosing your skills, you want to make sure you get an equal balance of the different attributes to level up a good well-rounded character. (ex:Heavy armor/Endurance, Light armor/speed Alchemy/Intelligence etc.);
, Now what you want to do is to go out and max all of your skills without sleeping in a bed once. (so that you don't level) Depending on what skills you chose this may be rather difficult, but in the end it will all be worth it. Make sure that you level any skills you chose under the Endurance attribute first so that as you level you get as much health as possible.

, Now, go to the Skingrad Mages Guild and acquire any of the Drain Skill spells from the mage, Sulinus Vassinus. This spell requires you to at least be apprentice in Destruction so if you're not, pick up any novice spell you can find to help you train. Now, find a spellmaking altar and create custom Drain Skill spells affecting some of your chosen major skills.. They should be on self, have a magnitude of 100, and a duration of 1 second.

, If by now you haven't caught on to what you're doing let me fill you in. Every level you can find a skill trainer and have them train a skill 5 times per level. So, every time you sleep and gain a level find a skill trainer that trains one of your major skills, cast your custom spell, and train. The reason the skill your training should already be at 100 should become quite clear as of now. You're training your skills over 100. These skill increases will count towards leveling thus, if you continue to do this for each level you will be able to extend your levels beyond what's normally possible.

The first step is to know what your leveling up.,
Next, you need to know where you stand.,
Method One: start ""A Rat Problem"" at the Anvil Fighter's Guild.,
Method Two: This method is not as effective as Method One and will probably take you a lot longer to raise your level.,
Method Three: If you aren't relying on quests or add-ons, go to the sewers in the Imperial City and collect rats as in Method One.",How to Increase Your Block Skill Quickly in Oblivion," If 'block' is one of your major skills, this will work best for you.;
, If you are not in the fighters guild, I suggest you join. If you have not yet completed the ""A Rat Problem"" quest, then method one will work well for you.

, Make your way to Arvena's home and speak to her. When she is done, enter her cellar and kill any mountain lions there. Bring up a shield, weapon, or your fists and attack each one of the rats once. Then block and let them all attack you. DO NOT KILL THE RATS. Once all of the rats are dead, you won't have anyone to help you raise your block level. The next time you speak to Arvena, she will call off the quest since all of her ""poor babies"" are dead.

, First, you will have to purchase the ""Battlethorn Castle"" add-on from the marketplace if you haven't already. It's a little pricey, but worth it. Once you have your castle and have bought/restored your fighting room in the basement, you will get a sparring partner. Ask him to fight you with any weapon of your choice, and then block him the entire time. It is not as effective as the first method, as it will cost you a little money and time.

You can usually drop items onto the ground without having to worry about them disappearing. This only works on the main map (not in dungeons), and enemies may pick p dropped weapons.
You can safely store items in Clams, Torn Sacks of Grain, and Sacks. Any containers in the houses you buy are safe as well."
"
Before engaging in combat, go into sneak mode and hide away a bit.,
If you cannot get a good analysis of the enemy, then it's best to go into combat and watch its strengths and weaknesses as it fights you, and then pick on its weaknesses.,
If you're close to death and don't have any healing potions or spells on you, then it's best to go on the defensive.",How to Defeat Tough Enemies in The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion," While doing this, examine the armor and weapon(s) the enemy is carrying, and what kind of creature he/she/it is.


If the enemy is very heavily armored, conventional weapons may be a bit hard. In this case, it is best to use a weakening spell. ""Corrode Armor"" is highly recommended, but other destruction/alteration spells may work as well, such as Drain Health or Weaken Endurance.
If the enemy is a mage or a conjurer (These may be identified by the robes they wear and are often carrying a one-handed blunt weapon), then a ranged weapon is best, as they often rely on ranged, damage spells that will damage you before you can come close enough to hit them with a melee weapon.
If the enemy is a creature, such as an ogre or bear, then conventional weapons, melee or ranged are okay to use. Although it is best to weaken the opponent with ranged spells or ranged weapons as it is charging before fighting close-range, as most of the time creatures have fast attack rates.
If the enemy is undead, then spells work efficiently, especially high-level ""Turn Undead"" spells. Conventional weapons are okay to use, but remember: Only silver, daedric or enchanted weapons will affect ghosts or wraiths. The undead usually have slow attack rates but high damage, so strike hard whenever you get the chance.
If the enemy is a daedra, then high-damage, heavy conventional weapons, such as claymores, are best to use, as light weapons often fare badly against daedra (But it still depends how high your Blade or Blunt skill is, if its very high, such as above 75, then light weapons are okay to use.)Few spells are effective against daedra, aside from most destruction spells. High-level daedra are immune to some spells, so be careful.
If your enemy is a vampire (May be identified by the red eyes, wrinkled face and pale-white skin), then don't let them get too close, because they have a chance of getting you infected. Use bows or destructive spells to damage them as best as you can. When they close in, get out your melee weapon. Block their blows and strike in between.;
, For example, ghost's weaknesses are silver or spells, daedric weapons are the weaknesses of most enemies e.t.c.

, Block continually, and watch for your opponent's pattern of attack. Once you've recognized when he/she/it pauses, strike whenever that moment comes (Most of the time, its right after the enemy has sent a blow and you've blocked it.)

Make sure you have a bow and at least 2 arrows;
,
Pull back on the bow so you are in the position where the arrow is in the bow but it has not been fired.,
Press B and go into your journal.,
As soon as this message appears wait exactly 3 seconds.,
Go and find the item you wish to duplicate and drop it from your inventory.",How to Duplicate Items in Tes 4 Oblivion Xbox 360 Game,", Keep the bow in this position and make sure the arrow hasn't been fired.

, Highlight the arrows in the weapons section of your inventory. Click on the arrows and a message will come up on the top of your screen saying ""You cannot unequip this weapon while an action is taking place"" (This may not be the exact message but it will be along these lines but there should be a message)

, After 3 seconds click on the arrows again and you will get the same message.

To get the blood, use the dagger provided by Melisande to stab any Argonian in the game.",How to Cure Vampirism in Oblivion2," There are a number of ways to go about this:


Assault or murder an Argonian. This will result in a bounty if witnessed.
Fight one in the Arena.
Find a hostile Argonian in the wild, such as a marauder archer in a dungeon.
The Dark Brotherhood quest The Renegade Shadowscale entails killing an Argonian. If it has already been completed but Scar-Tail is still alive, it's possible to return to Bogwater and stab him there. Also, the Purification quest is a good start.
The Argonian at Peryite's Shrine won't fight back, due to being in the trance.
There is a cave north of Bravil called Veyond Cave which contains several Argonians.
Seed-Neeus, the owner of Northern Goods and Trade in Chorrol, is essential and will not die if attacked.;
"
"
 Kill the vampire Hindaril, found in Redwater Slough off of the Panther River.",How to Cure Vampirism in Oblivion3," Hindaril is behind a door with a very hard lock. The key is beyond an underwater passage and in a chest. Once he is found he may be attacked immediately, before he arms himself.

Return to Melisande and talk to her.",How to Cure Vampirism in Oblivion4," After a day, she will have a potion ready. She will give the Hero both a consumable version, and a miscellaneous item version for Rona; however, drinking the potion early may bug the quest. Return to Skingrad and talk to the steward again. She will lead the Hero to the Chamber of the Lost, where Melisande will attempt to cure Rona.After two days, the count will tell the Hero to return in another twenty four hours and talk to the steward. Doing so will reward them with a decent amount of gold - 1,000 or higher, as the amount is leveled.The cure potion may now be consumed safely.

"
"
Pull the game difficulty right down by going to Gameplay options.,
Gather tons of gold.,
Join all the Guilds.,
Try to play a 'good guy' (a character with higher Fame than Infamy).,
Go through as many dungeons and Ayleid Ruins as possible.,
Train with the Adoring Fan, creatures you summon yourself, or even exploit the duplication glitch and apply enchanted item effects permanently.",How to Create a Super Character in Oblivion,";
, To do this, you'll have to exploit glitches. If you're uncomfortable about doing that, skip this step. You can exploit the Dorian or Kvatch Horseback glitch. Either one is fine. Make sure you don't collect too much gold; it can really stuff your game. One way to get cash without exploiting glitches is to get a huge amount of ingredients (They can be found anywhere, and are pretty easy to get.)and make a lot of potions, even if they don't do anything. sell them all (Preferably to the same merchant, it raises their disposition if you sell to them often), and watch your mercantile and alchemy skills soar! When you are a master in alchemy, make huge amounts of potions with one ingredient each, and using your high mercantile, haggle and get a good price for each of them. Remember, it is also good to do the standard ""Dungeon Raiding"" technique, these are just if you want to save time.

, Thieves Guild is optional; Dark Brotherhood is strongly recommended. Take armour, enchanted items, etc. from the Guild Halls.

, If you prefer, you can be a bad guy, though; it's a roleplaying game after all.

, The Ayleid Ruins, especially, as most of them contain Welkynd Stones and Varla Stones.

, Do not apply Night Eye, Chameleon, Detect Life or Water Walking permanently. It'll be a pain.

Pick the race of Breton, someone with a high magic resistance like the Breton's will be perfect for this;
,
Play through the game as any class you like I recommend the Mage class as it works better and you will need access to the Arcane University to be able to do this.

,
Level up to mid 20's.,
Get 5 grand soul gems filled with grand souls and go the enchanting place (the Chironasium) at the Arcane University.,
Enchant all of the armor set with reflect physical and reflect magical damage.",How to Create an Invincible Character in Oblivion With No Cheats,",, it's not necessary but Daedric Armor would be cool to enchant with this, but any heavy armor should do the trick nicely

, There are also Altars of Enchantment inside the Arch-Mage's quarters and available as part of the Frostcrag Spire plug-in.

,


If done properly you should see that your PHYSICAL DAMAGE REFLECTION WILL BE 110% AND YOUR MAGIC DAMAGE REFLECTION WILL BE 105%

"
"
Begin by choosing a race.,
When it comes to birth signs, the Thief may seem obvious, but consider others such as the Steed.,
The Thief is probably your best option for a class, but if you decide to create a custom class bear in mind that your main skills will be speed, stealth and security.

,
Once you've finished the tutorial, your first move should be joining the Thieves Guild.,
Your next step might seem an odd choice, but for any character in Oblivion it is a great way of leveling up and earning extra gold.,
While it might not seem like a thief needs to have a decent set of armour, if you get caught stealing it's possible to pay off your bounty without having your stolen items confiscated.",How to Create a Thief Character in Oblivion," The best race for a thief character is Khajiit, but take time to look at the other races as well. Each one comes with their own perks - Argonians can breathe underwater, which comes in handy when travelling around Tamriel.;
, It will give your character a great speed boost, which will come in useful if your character has to quickly sneak away from a crime scene.

,, The easiest way to do this is to commit a crime and be sent to jail - if you intend to join the Dark Brotherhood a murder is probably the best choice, as it will give you the opportunity to join both factions in one. Shortly after serving your sentence you'll be approached and given a message. Follow the instructions to the Garden of Dareloth, and before you know it you'll be a member of the Thieves Guild (for further information on this quest and others try 'www.uesp.net'.)

, So, step number five is to go to the Arena in the Imperial City. Speak with Owyn to join up. Work your way through at your own pace - you can leave to do other quests in the meantime, so don't forget to upgrade your weapons and armour when you can afford it.

, It's easy to sneak into the Garden of Dareloth at midnight from outside of the Imperial City, then all you need to do is pay Armand Christophe half of your bounty. If you don't have the gold though, you'll need to go adventuring for it in mines, ruins and camps. That's where the armour and weapons come in - you do not want to be stuck in a mine with a goblin skirmisher with only a shirt and pants plus no weapon to defend yourself with.

Locate the Bloated Float Inn in the Imperial City's Waterfront District.,
Speak with Ormil, the inn's High Elf publican, about a bed and rent one out.,
Go to your rented room and sleep for however long you want by selecting the bed and choosing to sleep.,
Wait until you wake up and a quest update will explain that the ship has somehow been put out to sea.

,
Open your room door and speak with the bandit Lynch who is standing outside in the way.,
Kill Lynch and loot his corpse for the key to the storage room.,
Free the inn's bouncer, the Orc Graman gro-Marad, from the storage room using the key you looted from Lynch.,
Make your way back up the stairs to the main deck and speak with another bandit called Minx.,
Kill Minx and loot her corpse for the key to the top deck of the ship.,
Make your way outside to the top deck and speak to the bandit Wrath.,
Kill Wrath and loot his corpse for the final key, which unlocks Ormil's private quarters in which Ormil is being held by Selene.,
Enter the cabin behind the bar on the main deck where Selene is holding Ormil.

,
Decide whether you want to kill Selene or try to negotiate her surrender.,
Talk to Ormil.,
Make your way back down to your room and sleep for as long as you want by selecting the bed and choosing to sleep.,
Talk to Ormil back up on the main deck and he will inform you that there was a bounty for Selene and he will reward you with a level-dependent amount of gold (ranging from 75 gold at level 1-4, up to 450 gold when you reach level 25 or higher).",How to Complete the An Unexpected Journey Quest on Oblivion," The Bloated Float is a ship inn docked in the Waterfront's bay and can be entered via the door on its' side.;
, It will cost you 10 gold to rent a bed for the night. Ormil can usually be found behind the inn's counter.

, Your room is located below deck and is through the door on the left - the door on the right is sealed and cannot be opened.

,, He will explain that he is part of a group called the 'Blackwater Brigands' and that the ship's bouncer has been locked in the ship's storage room. After you have finished talking to him, he will attack you.

, All the 'Blackwater Brigands' are fairly easy to kill, so it will not take long to eliminate him.

, Simply walk to the door and activate it to unlock it. Graman gro-Marad will explain that he will be able to steer the ship back to the Waterfront, but that you'll need to clear the rest of the ship first.

, She will tell you that the leader of the gang is called Selene. After you have finished talking with her, she will attack you.

, Again, she will be easy to kill, so it will not take you long to defeat her.

, He will reveal that the gang are hijacking the ship in search of the treasure 'The Golden Galleon' (a fictional treasure which Ormil conjured up in order to attract customers to the inn, on which it was supposed to be hidden). After you have finished talking to him, he will attack you.

, He will be easy to kill. Graman gro-Marad will move to the top deck to guide the ship back to the Waterfront.

,, She is fairly easy to kill, but her enchanted weapon drains fatigue, so you may want to try to negotiate her surrender instead.


In order to make Selene surrender, you must talk to her and select the following dialogue in order: ""I took the key from Wrath"", ""I'm here to join the gang"", ""...three months ago?"", ""To find the Golden Galleon"", ""You mean in Bravil?"", ""I've killed all of them."" When you tell her the rest of the ""Blackwater Brigands"" are dead, she will surrender to you and give you her enchanted sword - the Blackwater Blade.
If you want to kill Selene, then try killing her quickly before her sword drains all your fatigue. Loot Selene's corpse for the Blackwater Blade.

, He will tell you the story of the Golden Galleon and then tell you to rest in the bed which you rented while the ship heads back to the Imperial City Waterfront.

, When you wake up, the ship will be back at the Waterfront District.

, He will also take back all the keys for the Bloated Float. Finish talking to him and the quest will have been completed.

Gain enough experience to reach Level 2; if you are not at this level you will not be allowed to complete the quest.,
Find Sheogorath's Shrine, one of many Daedric shrines in Cyrodiil.,
Speak to the followers of Sheogorath around the shrine, who will direct you to the Dark Elf character Ferul Ravel, who is dressed in white robes.

,
Talk to Ferul Ravel, who will instruct you to gather certain items in order to summon Sheogorath; you will need to find a lesser soul gem, a head of lettuce and some yarn as an offering.,
Gather the lesser soul gem (Easily available from any mages guild if you belong to one or magic shop), a head of lettuce (Try looking around small townships which have vegetable patches or in houses with kitchens) and some yarn (Found all over the land as random treasure in crates and barrels).

,
Return to Sheogorath's Shrine and activate the Shrine of Sheogorath with the items in your inventory.,
Listen to Sheogorath's instructions; he will ask you to go to the fellowship of Border Watch to simulate an old prophecy, the K'Sharra Prophecy, which comprises of 3 acts, although only two will be known to you.

,
Travel to Border Watch.,
Ask the locals of Border Watch about the prophecy and they will direct you to the village shaman Ri'bassa, who wears black robes and usually stays in his house (Located at the entrance to the village) or the Border Watch Inn (Located at the back of the village).

,
Talk to Ri'bassa.,
Create the first sign by talking to the owner of the Border Watch Inn, S'thasa, who has a fine collection of cheeses.,
Wait until most of the Inn's customers have left and sneak around the counter until you are standing directly behind S'thasa.,
Make your way back to the cheese counter and use the key on the case when S'thasa isn't looking.,
Go outside and you should see a fire and pot to your left.,
Wait a while and you will see a lot of rats running up the steps to the pot.,
Talk to Ri'bassa about the sign; although he will come to you if you do not come to him.

,
Wait until Ri'bassa is gone and you will see that he has left a couple of mounds of rat poison on the ground along the steps.,
Place the rat poison in the hay by activating it and selecting yes.,
Make your way to the centre of Border Watch and wait for a cool sequence of flaming dogs falling from a blood red sky.,
Return to the Sheogorath's Shrine and activate it.",How to Complete the Sheogorath Quest on Oblivion," Fortunately, it will not take much to get to Level 2.;
, It is located roughly halfway between Bravil and Leyawiin and close to the border of Elsweyr. On your in-game compass a shrine symbol should appear once you get close enough to the shrine.

,, He may also say that Sheogorath can only be summoned in rainy weather, but if you have the items he will come anyway.

,, The items will be removed and the Daedric Prince will have been summoned.

,, It is almost directly south of the Shrine, but if you don't fancy walking through the woods (Especially at night) travel east from the Shrine until you reach the main road and travel south along it until you reach the settlement of Water's Edge. From there travel a short distance west and you will reach Border Watch.

,, Make sure his disposition is above 60 or he will not tell you about the prophecy, but once it is he will explain that the K'Sharra Prophecy is how the settlement believes the end of the world will begin; first there will a vermin infestation, secondly all the town's livestock will mysteriously die. The last sign is apparently so horrible that Ri'bassa will not tell you.

, She will tell you of her prized cheese, the Olroy Cheese, which is so strong smelling that she keeps it locked in a case at the Inn. You need to steal this cheese to attract the rats needed for the first sign. There is a Very Hard lock on the cheese case, so the easiest way to open it is by stealing the key.

, When the timing is right, pickpocket the key to the cheese case from her. She may catch you, so try to save beforehand so you won't raise your bounty.

, Then take the Olroy Cheese while no one is looking - and the hardest part of the quest is over.

, Walk to the pot and activate it to bring up the option of putting the cheese in the pot; select yes and the Olroy Cheese will be removed from your inventory.

, Do not kill them until they reach the top and a message says you are successful in faking the first sign. After that you may kill the rats, although Ri'bassa will do this eventually.

,, Collect this and make your way to the right of the Border Watch Inn where you will find a sheep pen. In the middle is a feeding trough with hay.

, You can place both pieces of rat poison in, but only one is necessary. Wait for the sheep to eat the poison (Indicated by a glowing swirl above their heads) and they will eventually all die. Killing them directly will also work. You will then receive a message from Sheogorath congratulating you and telling you to go to the centre of Border Watch.

, Everyone will begin running around and the sky will remain red until you leave.

, You will be awarded with the Wabbajack, a magical staff which will turn creatures such as deer, horses, crabs and sheep into a random creature such as a goblin, ogre or rat for a limited time. You will also gain one Fame point. After you have received the staff the quest will be completed.

Purchase a Soul Trap spell or scroll from any Mage's Guild hall across Cyrodiil or from another trader dealing in Soul Trap spells - you cannot capture a soul without one.,
Acquire a soul gem - the types of soul gem are petty, lesser, common, greater, grand and black.,
Locate a creature who's soul you want to capture, or if you have a Black soul gem, an NPC (such as an Arena combatant or bandit).,
Cast your Soul Trap spell on the intended target, or hit them with your Soul Trap-enchanted weapon, and kill them with a soul gem in your inventory before the duration of the spell runs out.,
Look in your inventory at your soul gems and you'll see a filled soul gem and captured a soul.",How to Capture a Soul in Oblivion," You will need to have a Mysticism skill of at least 25 to use the most basic Soul Trap spell, although you can be of any level to use Soul Trap scrolls or a weapon with a Soul Trap enchantment on it. The longer the duration of the Soul Trap spell, the better, as you will have a longer time to capture the soul. As an alternative, the sword Umbra (part of the Clavicus Vile Daedric Quest), has a soul trap effect on strike, as do several other magical weapons.;
, Although any soul gem can be used to capture a soul, the larger the soul, the larger the soul gem needed. For example, a mud crab with a soul level of 'petty' can fit in any size of soul gem, but a Minotaur Lord's 'grand' soul level can only be trapped in a grand or black soul gem. Black soul gems are technically like grand soul gems, but can capture NPC souls as well - they can be created using methods discovered during the Necromancer's Moon Mages Guild quest. Soul gems can be bought from most mages stores, in random loot and from Mages Guild halls and range in price depending on their level. In addition, you can obtain Azura's Star, a re-usable Grand soul gem artifact, by completing the Azura daedric quest.

, The easier the creature is to kill, the smaller its soul level will likely be and the smaller the soul gem you'll need. Creatures such as deer, goblins, mud crabs and rats are easy to practice using Soul Trap spells on. When you become better acquainted with capturing souls, consider tackling larger targets such as Daedroth, Lich and Gloom Wraiths, which have high-leveled souls. If you want to capture an NPC's soul, do so where no one can see you, as casting a soul trap on someone will incur a bounty if spotted.

, If you kill them before time runs out, then the creature's soul will fill the most suitable soul gem in your inventory - for example, if you kill a mud crab with its petty soul, it will fill a petty soul gem if you have one. However, if you only have a Grand soul gem, it will fill that with its petty soul. However, if you fail to kill your target before the spell runs out, you will either need to cast the spell again or miss out on the chance of capturing the soul. For this reason, it is advisable to not cast the Soul Trap spell until the target is just about dead, in order to give yourself the maximum amount of time to capture it, or use a long-duration Soul Trap spell.

, Congratulations! Now you can use the filled soul gem to recharge your magic items and enchant weapons and armour. However, once you use them, they are gone forever, unless you are using the re-usable Azura's Star. Of course, the larger the soul level, the more re-charge they will provide. If you failed to capture the soul due to there not being a soul gem large enough to capture it, then a message will appear at the top left hand corner of the screen telling you so.

Talk to Elante of Alinor, who will now be standing at the shrine.,
Exit Brittlerock Cave and return to speak to Azzan in Anvil for the standard level-dependent gold reward and 1 fame point which you receive for completing a Fighters Guild contract.",How to Complete The Wandering Scholar Quest in Oblivion," If you ask him about available contracts, Azzan will tell you about Elante of Alinor, a wandering scholar who is studying Daedric shrines in Oblivion. Elante wants to study a Daedric Shrine in Brittlerock Cave and has asked the Fighters Guild for protection.;
, It is located on the Gold Coast, northwest of Kvatch, north-northwest of Fort Wariel and is surrounded by a few minor encampments. If you have already found the site, then it will be possible to fast-travel there once you exit the Anvil Fighters Guild.

, There are two entrances - the main entrance which is marked on your map, and a second one located outside, behind the main door about 20–30 meters (65.6–98.4 ft) away. Use your area map, as the second entrance will appear when you near it.

, She will be located directly inside the main entrance to the cave and will likely be marked with a green marker point on your map. After you have finished talking with her, she will begin to move towards the Daedric Shrine at the end of the first level of the cave.

, There are two ways of doing this, and each way has its' own merits and drawbacks:


Traditionally, you could stay close to Elante and kill any daedra which attack her. This may be viable for lower-level characters, as you likely only encounter lower-level daedra, which Elante will be able to help you kill off. However, this is still highly risky, and when you are a higher-level character, near impossible, as you will be versing the likes of Daedroth, Spider Daedra, Storm Atronach and Xivilai. The next method may be better suited if this is the case.
Alternatively, you could clear the cave of daedra and then lead Elante to the Daedra Shrine afterwards. The drawback is that you will be fighting the daedra alone and that you need to make sure that Elante is not following you. Elante only follows you if you are within a certain distance; if you simply run ahead of her, she will stay at the entrance out of harm's way. Or alternatively, simply do not talk to her at all when you enter the cave, clear it and then talk to her.

, There is a whole other level to the cave complex, but she will not enter it, so you only need to clean out the first level to make sure she's safe. A quest pop-up will appear telling you that ""Elante of Alinor has reached the Daedric shrine, and is ready to leave Brittlerock Cave"". See the Tips section if she gets stuck in the cave.

, She will tell you that she wishes to stay at the shrine for research and that you are free to go. Elante will also hand you 2920, Morning Star (v1), a Blade Skill book, as a reward. See the Tips section if she doesn't talk to you.

, If you have also completed The Fugitives quest from Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal, then you can also ask Azzan for an Advancement in rank; you will now be a Guardian and receive 10 gamerscore if you are playing on the Xbox 360. After you have finished talking to Azzan, the quest will have been completed.

You can become a vampire by contracting the disease porphyric hemophilia, sometimes caught while battling vampires or other undead creatures. On Azura's Shrine quest (Level 2) you can do her quest and enter the cave since all of them are vampires let them hit you until you contract 'porphyric hemophilia' then finish the quest for a special reward or just leave. Another way to get it is to get pretty far in the ""Dark Brotherhood"" quests, up until you stop getting quests from Vincent. Ask him about vampirism, and of course say you want to be a vampire. He will bite you the next time you sleep in the sanctuary. This is the safest and most reliable way to become a vampire. If you don't want to kill someone to join the Dark Brotherhood, then a good way to get vampirism is to do the Gray Prince's quest in the arena. There are vampires in it, and if you don't get the disease - don't worry. Complete the quest, and the Gray Prince will become depressed. When it is time to fight him in the arena, he won't fight back. This will count as murder and allow you to enter the Dark Brotherhood, but will be completely legal. Once you've contracted vampirism you'll then need to know how to deal with it.


Good areas for encountering vampires include Barren Cave, Bloodcrust Cavern, Crowhaven, Memorial Cave, some areas of the Imperial City Underground, other vampire-orientated forts and caves and anywhere where zombies can be found, since they also carry ""porphyric hemophilia"".;
, You can deal with vampirism so much more easily if you can retreat into your own house rather than having to find some random place to stay in while the sun is up. Vampirism has four stages; the first gives you a few abilities, but no real detriments other than a slight weakness to fire. However, after 24 hours of not drinking blood, your vampirism goes up to stage two where you take sun damage. The sun damage increases with each day that you do not drink blood, so finding a place of your own is a big help. The best house to buy is also the cheapest; for 2000 gold you can buy a shack in the Imperial City Waterfront, close to the beggars you will need later on. You can buy this house from Vinicia Melissa at the Office of Imperial Commerce in the Imperial City Market District. In addition, certain downloadable content, such as the ""The Vile Lair"", can be substituted for a house, although you may need to pay for upgrades to it - see further down for more information on using downloadable content to aid you in handling vampirism.

, As a vampire, you need to drink blood to keep energized. No matter which stage of vampirism you are at, whenever you bite someone's neck you will restart at the lowest level of vampirism where you do not take sun damage. You can bite someone's neck by going up to a sleeping person and pressing the action/activate button. Select ""feed"" to bite their neck and in a few seconds you'll be refreshed. The easiest prey are beggars - they sleep in the open, are easily accessible, are found in most cities and are often not around other people when resting, so your neck biting goes unnoticed and therefore, does not incur a fine. From your house in the Imperial City Waterfront, the easiest beggar to feed on is Puny Ancus, who is directly behind Methredhel's house (just up the road from yours) and right next to the garden where Armand Christophe meets new Thieves Guild members (behind the abandoned shack next to Methredhel's house). Puny goes to sleep every night at 10pm (like all beggars), giving you roughly 2 hours before Armand Christophe enters the area. Sneak up to Puny (but be careful not to be seen; if the sneaking eye is bright someone can see you) and feed on him. This can be done with anyone, but this location is the easiest.

, Don't just automatically assume that vampirism is an absolutely bad thing to have - you get awesome powers and abilities and if you can get the handle of things, it could make you more powerful than imagined - see the embedded video in this article for more information on the different skills you can gain while affected by vampirism. This could be especially helpful if you don't mind exploring at night and sleeping during the day, although you can explore dungeons and caves during the day also. Entering a night session of the Arena as a vampire can also give you the fighting edge you need, although you can only fit one night session of Arena combat in per evening before it closes, unless you have finished the Arena quest line, in which case you can battle creatures any time of the day, once a week.

, You need to be ever vigilant when you have vampirism - between sun damage and suspicious people, you'll need to make sure that you get to where you need to go before the sun comes up, or make it to a feeding site before you begin to take sun damage in Stage 2 of vampirism. It can be a real pain stopping halfway through exploration to feed, but be patient and try to complete the Vampire Cure quest if it is too much of a hassle, or find other ways to deal with the problem such as ""The Vile Lair"" downloadable content. The sun goes down at 8pm in the evening, so be sure to get out as soon as it does to start exploring and completing quests.

, In particular, ""The Vile Lair"" is made with vampires in mind - it includes a purchasable prisoner on whom you can feed and a Font Of Renewal, which will cure you of vampirism. This is most helpful as you will not need to buy it to use it. You can download ""The Vile Lair"" off the Xbox Live marketplace for 150 Microsoft points if you are playing on the Xbox 360 or off certain internet sites if you are playing on the PC. Be aware that some costs may apply or alter for downloading this content.

, The Vampire Cure quest can be started by talking to Raminus Polus at the Arcane University south of the Imperial City. The quest is long and very hard, but eventually you will be cured of vampirism. In addition to this method of cure, you can access the Font of Renewal in the ""Vile Lair"" content pack, which will cure you of vampirism and is a far easier route of curing the disease. After you have been cured, you may never become a vampire again, unless you are on the PC and use modifications.

When you create your character make a custom class with all your major skills being the seven magical attributes.,
Then get access to an spellmaking altar either through the arcane university or if you don't want to go through all that trouble get frostcrag spire (if you buy this you can access a glitch in which you can get as many of every sigil stone in the game and a very good mace which levels your blade skill) then create very weak spells for all of the skills of magic.,
Once you have weak spells for all the magical attributes, just cast them constantly as you walk around doing your own thing and you will level very fast.,
To master alchemy in like 20 minutes you must have collected the two of same kind of scroll and one of another describes earlier.,
Also every single time you sleep and level up, you should train 5 times in something before the next time you sleep.",How to Be Great at Oblivion Elder Scrolls IV,"(actually you might want to avoid restoration and destruction because they take a significantly greater amount of time than the other magical attributes. Sneak is pretty fast if you exploit the pickpocket trick where you use the adoring fan but to do that you have to beat the arena instead of just leveling at the beginning of the game. also you can go in the basement of Arvena Thelas in anvil which is a lady with a bunch of rats and do a destruction spell that won't harm any of them so they all start attacking you to quickly level your block/heavy armor/light armor. This is probably quicker than restoration and destruction so that's an option too)Selecting skills as major skills doesn't make them stronger or anything it just puts them at 25 initially and and they are the skills that leveling your character will be reliant on. So when you level your major skills 10 times you level will go up. And the other skills don't matter towards leveling. The magical skills(except restoration and destruction) are the easiest to level and you should be able to master them in about 2 hours of gameplay except for alchemy which takes like 20 minutes or something if your willing to use the duplication glitch. So these skills are ideal for fast and easy leveling. You can make the skills you want stronger the normal way.;
, (Example: light on self for 1 sec magnitude 3 for illusion) For destruction make weakness to something spell so you're not hurting your self. You can get one of these spells at the magic emporium in the market district. (also get two of any scroll and one of another for later purposes)

, (to cast at an even faster rate hold block and continually hit the cast button) Each skill should master in about 2 hours which levels your character about 7 times for every mastered skill(one level for every ten skill increases)

, This is done by exploiting the duplicating glitch which will help you significantly in almost everything. To do this you must select a scroll twice and drop anything. (you do not have to open your journal in mid-attack or anything like that) You must however have more scroll than the thing you are trying to duplicate. For example if you have 5 iron daggers and you want more you must have more than 5 of the same kind of scrolls. If you have 92 of the same kind of scrolls and you drop the daggers you will get 92 daggers. So to get a lot of scrolls so you can duplicate a lot of things you must use the 2 scrolls to dupe the one. Then pick up only one and dupe it again. them pick up all four and dupe the 2 and so on. So when you have like 100 of one scroll just get one corn and one potato or any other two compatible ingredients. (also get a mortar and pestle which you can find in the beginning sewers) them just dupe the corn and potatoes until you have like 1500 of each. then just open your journal and go to your mortar and pestle and continually press the make potion button. You will be a master of alchemy super quick. This will gain your character like 7 levels in twenty minutes.

, It is a hassle but in some skills it is worth it. You can master a skill in twenty level ups without even using the skill. This is good to do in armorer since the normal way it takes very long and it is a very helpful skill to have mastered. It takes about 96 hours of running to master but if you train while leveling it can take like an hour.

There's really just one path that you can take. Follow it, fighting leveled creatures and taking loot from the fleshy pods (if you're in Kvatch).


In Kvatch, you should end up in a relatively open plane after this. The tower is in sight. Walk up to the door and go inside.

, In one of the rooms, you'll find a door to your direct left leading outside (direct left meaning that you may need to backtrack to avoid walls).You're on a long bridge. Run across.

, Head up the ramp to find a man locked up. He tells you to kill the Daedra guarding him for the key to the sigil keep. Do so.

, You should have noticed that some doors were locked, as they required a sigil key. You have the keys now, so run across the bridge to the main tower. Unlock the door, and continue heading up like before, battling through the rooms.

, Head inside, with the key. You're nearly there! Follow the path until a large room.

, You should see a large, fiery ball. This is the sigil stone, and it keeps the gate open.

, After a little while, you will be returned safely into the real world. You have closed the gate!

From outside Tower of Hera, head east until you see a cave with a sign pointing you to Rosso’s Ore Mine. Go inside the cave and make your way through moving platforms. Merge with the mountain wall in a central platform with 2 Lynels. Use your hammer to ascend via moving platforms until you reach the top. There you will find a heart piece.
You will go through Lorule to access the Ice Ruins, pretty much the same thing with the path you took through Rosso’s Ore Mine in Hyrule. When you reach the gargoyle statues, head left and use the Tornado Rod to move north from platform to platform. Right outside the door is portal that leads you to the heart piece.
From Tower of Hera, go southwest and fall down to the center of the gap. Upon landing, head north (under a volcano) and get the heart piece.

Hatch a Chao egg from the Chao Garden (or buy one from the Black Market in Chao Kindergarten).

,
Raise it with Sonic and Shadow so it becomes a neutral Chao.

,
Give it primarily green chaos drives until turns an electric blueish color.

,
When it evolves into a Neutral Running Type Chao, it will have three quills and the color of the Chao will be green.,
Give it fruit (like Shadow Chao)and it will grow two extra quills, and then it will turn blue.",How to Get a Shadow Chao and a Sonic Chao2,",,, (Again, that's if you did it right.)

, This Chao will look a lot like Sonic! And if you want it to look more like Sonic, give it warthogs

"
"
The Sonic Chao is a neutral Chao, so to get one you have to either A) Pet it equally with both Sonic and Shadow or B) Get it so that it looks like it will be a Shadow Chao and then pet and feed it its favorite fruit only with a Hero Character.

,
People have often said that if you give your Chao any other Chaos Drives,or Animals then it will not become a Shadow or Sonic Chao, this is false.,
Do all the steps for Sonic but use a shiny yellow Chao or Gold Chao and when it evolves the second time give it some power drives too, but also give it more run drives.

",How to Get a Shadow Chao and a Sonic Chao3,", Sonic Chao are classified as Neutral/Run/Run Chao, which means they are Neutral (raised by both Hero and Dark evenly, or raised from birth in Sonic Adventure DX or the original Sonic Adventure), primarily run oriented at the time of first evolution. (you can change your chaos evolution path: I once changed my would be Neutral/Fly Chao into Neutral/Swim just before she evolved.). The second Run ( Neutral/Run/Run) means that, although you can still raise other stats besides run (give it other colored animals and drives), it is yet again primarily Run oriented. The Chao can change appearances still, as the Second Evolution (the one a Neutral/Run/Unevolved takes from Green to Blue with a blackish stomach) is gradual (it won't happen right away), and can change; a Neutral/Run/Run can easily become a Neutral/Run/Power with primarily Power (red) Chaos Drives and animals being given to it.

Beat Zaganaga.,
Beat Dharkstare.,
Beat Arrghus.,
Beat Yuga (Lorule Castle).,
Beat Yuga for the last time.",How to Defeat the Bosses in The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds," You will fight this boss inside the Eastern Palace. The idea is to stun him by shooting arrows across the center of the room when he appears after being in painting form. After you stun him, now is your chance to attack him with your sword or just continuously shoot him with arrows.


It is best just to defeat Yuga with the use of your sword because it causes more damage. This way, you will end the battle faster!;
, You will fight Moldorm in the Tower of Hera. The secret of defeating this boss is simple – attack its tail. That is the weakness you should exploit. Keep attacking the tail and son enough Moldorm will be defeated.


Be warned that each time Moldorm is hurt – it becomes faster and faster. Don’t lose your focus and just keep an eye on its tail.

, In order to beat this boss, you will need to use your Tornado Rod. Simply use it stun Margomill and then spam it with sword attack directly on its eye. Keep on doing this. Even if the boss becomes bigger, targeting on the next growth to break them off. Margomill will return to its original size then. Repeat the process until you defeat the boss.


Before facing Margomill, you will have to defeat first the House of Gales mini boss. Just like Margomill, just use your Tornado Rod to stun the creature and then attack with your sword to eventually defeat it.

, Yuga’s battle style will be a bit similar to the first time you encountered Yuga. Inside Hyrule Castle this time, he will still merge with the wall but with a twist - you will now be dealing with the three of them! It is up to you to figure out who’s the real Yuga. Simple enough, the real Yuga is the one who does not turn into a guard. After you find the real Yuga, follow his painting and attack him with your sword. Repeat the chase until he is defeated.

, Stalbind is the Thieve’s Hideout boss. Defeating Stalbind requires patience and proper timing. He is always on guard so your task is to create an opening so you can attack him with your sword. First, you must merge with his shield and attack his back upon detaching from the shield. He will occasionally breathe poison gases so you better dodge those. When you have the chance, merge with his shield again to attack him once more. After a while he will then toss his shield and charge you with his sword. Again, dodge the attack and counterattack. He could also remove his head to haunt with his foul breath but then again, dodging should do the trick. With alternate dodging and attacking, you should win the battle eventually.


There’s a mini boss in Thieve’s Hideout that can be easily beaten with proper positioning. During the battle just stand near the door and attack the creatures with your sword. This position will prevent you from being damaged.

, This battle will take place in the Dark Palace. Since it is dark, you need to light the torches in the room for you to see your foe. Gemesaur King will have an armor on so you need to destroy it first before you can do serious damage using your sword. Throwing bombs at it will weaken and eventually destroy its armor. That is your queue to attack with your sword! After a few hits, it will go berserk and blow out the torches. Just the same, re-light the torches and continue attacking it until it is defeated.


Gemesaur King’s weak spot is its head. Hit it with your sword if you have the chance.

, You will fight Grinexx in Turtle Rock. Use your Ice Rod when Grinexx goes near the centers of the room. This will do some damage. It will sometimes become angry so make sure to dodge its attacks. Then it will join you on the floor and attack once more. Again, dodge his attacks and do your own sword attack targeting its head. Repeat the process and this boss will fall eventually.

, Knucklemaster is virtually a giant armor hand that you need to defeat in Skull Woods. It has a giant eye on its palm which will be your main target when you attack. It has a devastating punch so be alert to merge with the wall when it attacks. It will be stunned after missing the hit. This is your chance to attack it with your sword. After a few more damages, it will turn purple and attempt to squash you! Again, simply merge with the wall or run around the room to dodge its attack resulting into a stun. Keep on attacking Knucklemaster while it’s stunned and it will be defeated soon enough.

, Zaganaga is the boss in Desert Palace. In order to beat Zaganaga, your main goal is to raise the sand in order to reach its position. It will create little flying creatures that will delay your sand raising but these creatures are mere annoyances since they can easily be beaten. Zaganaga will also spew sand around the room but don’t let this interfere with your main goal. When you finally reach Zaganaga, attack it with your sword and you will eventually win the battle.

, This battle will take place in Ice Ruins. That being said, the environment of this match will be a bit tricky. Since you’re surrounded with ice, it’s obvious that your Fire Rod will definitely come in handy in this battle. You will be able to attack Dharkstare after melting some ice around you. Watch out for the triangles that this boss creates and stay away from orbs when they glow white! Focus on melting ice and attacking and soon you will beat Dharkstare.


There’s also a mini boss in Ice Ruins. Well, mini bosses technically. They are a group of penguins! The technique in beating them is by going after the small ones first.

, Arrghus is the Swamp Palace boss. This battle is easier than it looks like. Your main goal is to pull Arrghus’ eyes out and attack the eyes with your sword to kill them. Just keep on doing this until all its eyes are gone. Now it will be easier for you to dodge its laser attacks and counterattack with your sword. Repeat this pattern until the boss is defeated.


You can merge with the wall during laser attacks to dodge it more effectively.
The mini boss in Swamp Palace is quite easy to defeat. All you need to do is dodge its electric projectiles and throw skulls at it. When it splits into two – just attack each of them with your sword and the should do the trick.

, This battle takes place inside Lorule Castle. This battle is pretty exhausting since there are no obvious shortcuts in winning. Yuga has now merged with Ganon. You really must rely on timing your dodges and counterattacks. You just have to keep on doing this pattern until Yuga does new attacks such as throwing its weapon towards you and occasionally vanishing at times. Again, just dodge the attacks and take advantage of the openings to deal your own damage. This will defeat Yuga eventually.

, You need to face Yuga again for the second time! This battle starts with a tennis match. After you hit Yuga – Princess Zelda will give you the Bow of Light. With this weapon equipped, you can now damage Yuga while merged to the wall. This will force him to detach from the painting and you can now attack him in his physical form with your Master Sword. At this point, Yuga will spawn a bunch of enemies and obstacles just to protect himself from you. Simply dodge these and shoot Yuga with the Bow of Light each time you have the chance. Take advantage the opportunity to damage him with your Master Sword when he is out of the painting. Keep on doing this routine until you defeat Yuga.

Run south of Kakariko Village to find the mini-game.,
Once the game starts, run your timer.,
Run up and talk to the girl.",How to Farm Rupees in The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds2," Also, make sure that you have 50 rupees because that is what it costs to play.


Rupee Rush is a mini-game that Link can partake in. The goal is to collect as many rupees as possible within 30 seconds. However, the game will not inform you of how much time you have remaining. So, for this method to work, you will need a stopwatch. Most people just use the stopwatch on their smart phone.
In Lorule, the mini-game is located south of Thieves' Town and costs 100 rupees to play.

, If you run up to the NPC, and talk to the girl with less than one second remaining on the timer, you will earn triple the amount you would have had otherwise. So, if you time it correctly, you can expect around 300 rupees at a minimum per run.


Play the mini-game as many times as you want. Another way to gauge how much time is left on the mini-game is to listen to the music. This is a matter of preference. You may not like using a timer or you may not want to keep track of the music. Simply use whichever way is better for you. The music will change in the last two seconds remaining.
You'll get a Piece of Heart if you earn at least 100 rupees (150 rupees in Lorule).

, Once you hear the shift in the music, count another second to yourself of waiting, then that’s when you actually run up and talk to the girl. This should end the mini-game at the right time."

, It is a tool that can be purchased from Ravio’s shop for 800 Rupees. It is extremely useful in this fight because using the hammer on Moldorm (anywhere on his body) will stun him. Therefore, you should make sure that you have the hammer with you.

, The only way to actually damage Moldorm is by hitting the red dot at the end of his tail. This is why the hammer is so useful. If Moldorm is stunned, it will be significantly easier to manage attacking his tail.

Remove the stylus by pulling straight out, in the opposite direction of the tonearm.,
Take note of the cartridge manufacturer's name and model and find a compatible replacement stylus.,
Slip the new stylus back into the opening in the cartridge.,
Choose a replacement cartridge based on which types are compatible with your turntable manufacturer and model.,
Remove the headshell from the tonearm.,
Adjust tracking pressure when changing the cartridge.,
Get into the underside of the turntable.,
Remove the old belt once visible, and clean it.,
Reassemble and enjoy!

",How to Change the Needle on a Vinyl Player,";
, If purchasing in a store, it will be helpful to bring the old stylus. If a compatible stylus is no longer available for your cartridge, both the cartridge and stylus will need to be replaced. Replace the cartridge as instructed in the next section before inserting the new stylus.

, The point should be facing downwards.

, The cartridge usually plugs into a jack secured in the head shell or tonearm. The cartridge is either a ""pull out"" and ""slip in"" arrangement, similar to the stylus, or held in place with small hex nuts and screws to a removable headshell. The latter is less obvious and is the one described in this article., Most head shells are secured by a compression ring or nut, which, when loosened, will allow the headshell to be separated from the tonearm. If not fitted into a socket mounted in the headshell, several individual color-coded wires with connectors crimped on the ends will need to be carefully slipped off the cartridge pins. The new cartridge will include a wiring diagram to make reconnects worry-free. Like many small electronic devices, it should be handled with care and aligned with the sockets to be eased into final position. Once the headshell is removed, use jeweler's screwdrivers to unscrew the screws.

, Cartridges have different weights, so the counterbalance (on the opposite end of tonearm) and skew adjustments (usually an adjustment at the rear and near - but not on the tonearm itself) will need to be set. When tracking pressure is properly set, the stylus will ""sit"" fully in the record's groove. The new cartridge will include a recommended counterbalance weight - often in expressed in grams. It can be accurately set by weighing the downward pressure at the stylus. The anti-skew setting helps keep the stylus pressure equal in horizontal directions - this helps prevent the tonearm from skidding across the record if bumped.

, Depending on model, it may be accessible by removing a cover on the underside, removing the platter, or removing screws that allow lifting the entire mechanism up and out from the cabinet. From here you will be able to access the belt.

, Using alcohol and a clean rag, gently clean all the surfaces that the belt contacts. Wipe the inner surface of the belt with a clean, dry cloth to remove any contaminants (do not use cleaners or alcohol on this part as these can cause the belt to dry out prematurely). When all components are dry, slip the new, compatible belt on. Never apply lubricants to these surfaces.

Purchase a headphone jack at Radio Shack, about $4.,
Cut two lengths of speaker wire, long enough to reach from the internal speaker contacts to the contacts on the headphone jack.,
Purchase an FM transmitter from WalMart, in the automotive section, around $12.,
The headphone jack will accept an external speaker providing it has a stereo mini plug at the end.,
If you use an external speaker with your new set up, use one that has a volume control on it.,
When I first thought of doing this I thought it was beyond my pay grade, but as I thought more about it I decided to give it a shot.,
With the transmitter plugged in I can now receive the music on a boom box in the house, or any radio within range, and I have that boom box hooked up to two outside speakers under the eaves on the front of my house, and broadcast the music on those at the same time as through the transmitter.,
For those who have a similar unit but have trouble with it working properly on a timer, I have this tip.,
This was an easy project and I'm glad I didn't give up on it.",How to Add an FM Transmitter or External Speaker to GE Lights and Sounds of Christmas,"  One that will accept a stereo mini plug.  Remove cover of the unit to expose the internal speaker.  Drill hole in side of the cover of the unit, in close proximity to the internal speaker.  Hole should be just big enough to allow the threaded end of the Headphone jack to slide in.  Secure it with the washer nut.
,  Using an electronic soldering iron, solder the ends of the speaker wires to the internal speaker and then to the headphone jack.  Do not remove the existing wires to the internal speaker from their contacts.  Replace the cover of the unit and secure all screws.  The headphone jack will now accept mini plugs from either an FM transmitter, or an external speaker.  If you want to allow both to work at the same time, you need to put in another headphone jack, and repeat the process.,  The one that has the 6"" patch cord and mini plug attached.  This comes with 20 pre set channel selections.  Use your vehicle as a test by turning your radio on and tuning to the channel you have set on the transmitter.  Experiment with all the channels on the transmitter to see which one gives you the best sound quality.  I chose 90.1 and can pick up the sound from my unit up to about 200' in any direction of the house.  This transmitter is run with 2 triple A batteries.  You will need to turn it off and unplug it every night and bring it in the house or the batteries won't last long.  If you live in warmer climates, just turn it off each night.,  If it does not you will need to solder one to the end of the wires.  Get one at Radio Shack for next to nothing.  Use a stereo plug even though the jack is wired from one speaker, it carries the full range of stereo sound.  Radio Shack also carries extension patch cords to allow the external speaker to be at some distance from the unit.  I have my unit in an enclosed area, out of the weather, and, I also built a wooden housing for the entire unit to keep it dry and snow free.  You can add as many patch cords as you need to acquire the length you need.  Use cords that have the stereo plugs at the ends and use stereo connectors to plug them together.  No sound quality will be lost whatever the length you chose.  I have 40' of patch cords plugged together and the sound is perfect.  The patch cords are not cheap however, and this was the most expensive part of the project.  All in all about $30 for the entire project, including the transmitter.,  This may require an extension cord as well for the speaker, for the amplified sound.  You can use a speaker without amplified sound if you prefer, but it will require a higher volume from your sounds machine.,  As it turned out it was one of the easiest projects I've done, and not at all as complicated as some would make you believe.  All it requires is a phillips screwdriver and a soldering iron for tools.  The supplies may put a dent in your debit card account, but it wasn't nearly as expensive as I thought, and the results are well worth the $30 it cost.,  Now all passersby, either on foot or in their vehicles can enjoy the music.  Fantastic addition to a really nice unit.,  Purchase a remote timer.  Stein's garden center or Walgreen's has them.  The remote will allow you to turn them on from the warmth of the inside of your house and turn them off when you want.  It also allows you to leave the power switch on the machine on.  It does not draw current to the machine when the timer is off, only to the remote timer itself.  My machine is outside, though somewhat protected, in the cold winter of Wisconsin, and have not had a problem at all.  However, I have found that these machines are power sensitive.  Dedicate one outlet for this machine and nothing else.  If you have more than one outside socket available, at different areas of the house, use one that has nothing else plugged into it.  I had to run an 80' extension cord, with this machine plugged into it, to the back of the house, to an empty socket, otherwise the songs would skip badly.  Now it works perfectly, every day, regardless of weather. ,  I hope all of you have the same great results that I've gotten.  Good luck, enjoy your efforts.  You will be pleased with the end result."

Locate the specification labels for your system.,
Write down these values.,
Calculate the total impedance of all of your speakers.,
Calculate the power each speaker will receive.,
Verify that your amp has enough power for your subs.,
Unplug your equipment.",How to Bridge Subwoofers1," Your amp should have a label near the speaker output jack that indicates the output power (measured in Watts) and the minimum impedance (measured in Ohms). Be sure that your use the values for bridged mode, it is usually double the minimum impedance as stereo mode (meaning you need a much high impedance to run a bridged system) and up to four times the power output.Your sub-woofers should also be labeled with an impedance value (in Ohms) and a value indicating the maximum power input that they can handle (in Watts).The majority of amps on the home theater market are only stable at 4 ohms when bridged. Most car stereo amplifiers can do 2 ohms.;
, You should have at least four different values written down.


Amp Bridged Output Power
Amp Bridged Minimum Impedance
Speaker Power Rating
Speaker Impedance

, To do this you should add together the speaker impedance number for all of your speakers. You want the impedance to be at least equal to the minimum impedance value of your amp on each channel, but not to exceed 16 Ohms unless your amp is specifically rated for impedance values above 16 Ohms.The formula for finding total impedance for speakers wired in series is Z1 + Z2 + Z3 …. = Ztotal. Where Z is the impedance of a given speaker.
For example, if you have three speakers with impedance values of 4 Ohms, 6 Ohms, and 8 Ohms your total impedance wired in series would be 18 Ohms (4+6+8=18).
The formula for finding total impedance of speakers wired in parallel is a little trickier. It is (Z1 x Z2 x Z3…) / (Z1 + Z2 + Z3…) =Ztotal.
So say you have two speakers with impedances of 6 Ohms and 8 Ohms. This time it would look like this: 1) Multiply the values. 6 x 8 = 48 Ohms 2) Add the values. 6 + 8 = 14 Ohms 3) Divide the top by the bottom to find your total impedance. 48/14 = 3.43 Ohms (rounded)
You can also use an impedance calculator such as this one http://www.speakerimpedance.co.uk/.

, This will be based upon the total impedance and the power output of your amplifier. You can use variations of Ohm’s Law to do the calculations yourselfor you can refer to the online calculator above. You do not want to overpower and blow your speakers.

, The output power should be stamped near the output jack on your amplifier and measured in Watts. You speakers should also be labeled with a wattage. The output wattage should meet or exceed the sum of all of your speakers. For example if you have two subs that each pull 200 W, you would want an amp that produces a minimum of 400 W. Ideally you would have an amp that produces more than what is required, this is referred to as ""head room"" and helps to avoid clipping., Wiring powered devices can be dangerous. If you are working on a car stereo system you can simply disconnect the battery terminals.

Complete the circuit.",How to Bridge Subwoofers2," You will need this wire to make the connections from your amplifier to your sub-woofers.12- to 16 gauge speaker wire is recommended for use with subwoofers.
See How to Wire Speakers for tips on connecting speaker wires.

, Check to see which two terminals are used for bridge mode on your amplifier. This will be labeled on the amp. Wire the first sub by running a wire from the positive terminal on the amp to the positive bridge terminal on the sub.

, If you wish to wire them in series, run a single wire from the negative terminal of the first sub to the positive terminal of the second sub. If you wish to wire them in parallel you will run two wires between the two subs. The firs will connect the two positive terminals, and the second will connect the two negative terminals.

, Connect the wire from the second sub's negative terminal to the negative bridge terminal on the amp. This will complete the circuit whether you are wiring in parallel or in series.

Wire the amplifier to the first subwoofer.,
Connect the two coils.,
Wire the second subwoofer to the first subwoofer.,
Connect the second sub's coils.,
Complete the circuit.,
Listen for inconsistencies.",How to Bridge Subwoofers3," The wiring here will be similar to wiring a single voice coil (SVC) sub-woofer. The difference to remember is that dual voice coil (DVC) subs have two coils, and thus four input terminals. Two of them are positive and two are negative. Choose one of the positive terminals and connect it to the positive bridged terminal of the amp.

, Just like wiring two separate speakers, the two coils within your DVC can be wired in series (increasing the sub's impedance) or in parallel (decreasing the sub's impedance).If you are wiring the coils in series then run a wire from the positive terminal of the first coil (the one wired to the amp) to the negative terminal of the second coil and from the negative terminal of the first coil to the positive terminal of the second.
If you are wiring the coils in parallel then run a wire from the first positive terminal to the second positive terminal and a wire from the first negative terminal to the second negative terminal.

, Again, you have the series verses parallel debate.If you choose to wire the subs in series, connect the negative end of the second coil in the first sub to the positive end of the first coil in the second sub (these circuits can get complicated fast). Next, connect the negative end of the first coil to the positive end of the second coil. Finally connect the negative end of the second coil to the negative bridged terminal on the amp.
If wiring in parallel, connect the negative end of the first sub's second coil to the negative end of the second sub's second coil. Connect the positive end of the first sub's first coil to the positive end of the second sub's first coil.

, Follow the same guidelines as when you connected the first sub's coils., Now comes the easy part. Regardless of which combinations of series and parallels you chose above to get the proper impedance and power distribution in your system, closing the circuit will be one easy step. Run a wire to connect the negative terminal of the second coil in your second sub to the negative bridged terminal of the amp.

, Power up your system and test it out. Start at a low volume and then slowly increase it to listen for anything that doesn’t sound right, like static or a difference in volume between the two subwoofers. If the bass and sub-bass are quiet or not present at all, something is mis-wired."

This will cause it to evolve into Golbat. You can raise a Zubat to level 22 by battling with it, or by giving it Rare Candy.Zubat can be caught at Altering Cave, Cave of Origin, Granite Cave, Victory Road, Meteor Falls, Seafloor Cavern, and Shoal Cave.
Golbats can be caught at Cave of Origin, Shoal Cave, Sky Pillar, Meteor Falls, Seafloor Cavern, and Victory Road.;
, You'll need to reach a high Friendship level to evolve Golbat into Crobat. See the section below for details on raising your Golbat's Friendship.

, You can check your Friendship level with Golbat by visiting the woman in the house in the lower-left corner of Verdanturf Town. When you talk to the woman with Golbat as the first Pokémon in your party, she'll let you know how your Friendship rates. Below are the lines you should look out for (Golbat will evolve at 220 Friendship):



150-199 - ""It likes you quite a lot. It seems to want to be babied a little.""

200-254 - ""It seems to be very happy. It obviously likes you a whole lot.""

255 - ""It adores you. It can't possibly love you any more. I even feel happy seeing it.""

, Once you think you have 220 Friendship points, have Golbat gain a level. You can do this through combat or by using a Rare Candy. If Golbat has 220+ Friendship, it will evolve to Crobat.


The friendship rating lady will not tell you when you've reached exactly 220. You'll have to guess based on what she says and what you've done since then.
Zubats and Golbats caught in the wild will start with a 70 Friendship rating.

, Your Friendship gains will decrease as you get closer to 220. The three tiers of Friendship gains are 0-99, 100-199, and 200-255. For example, gaining a level gives you 5 Friendship when your Friendship is 0-99, 3 points when your Friendship is 100-199, and 2 points when your Friendship is 200+.This section will denote the gains as a set, i.e. ""(5,3,2)"" for leveling up.

, This will give it a one point boost to all Friendship-raising activities. It will not affect the value of negative actions.

, This will give the Golbat a one-point boost to all Friendship-raising activities. You can get a Soothe Bell at the Slateport City Pokémon Fan Club. If you have the Golbat in a Luxury Ball and holding a Soothe Bell, you'll be getting 2 extra points for each action.

, Every time your Golbat gains a level, you'll gain a moderate boost to your Friendship (5,3,2).

, Using Golbat during gym leader battles, the Elite Four battle, or the Champion battle will give it a boost to Friendship (3,2,1).

, Every 256 steps you walk with Golbat in your party, you'll gain 1 Friendship point. Try to always keep your Golbat in your party for these small but easy gains.

, These items permanently boost your Golbat's stats, while also providing a boost to Friendship (5,3,2).


HP Up
Protein
Iron
Zinc
Carbos
PP Up/Max
Rare Candy

, The following items will give Golbat a big Friendship boost (10,10,10), but will have a negative impact on its EVs:


Pomeg
Qualot
Tamato
Grepa
Hondew
Kelpsy

, When Golbat faints in battle, it will lose a Friendship point. Try to switch it out if it is close to fainting. If it does faint, revive it at a Pokémon Center.

, Giving Golbat any health items like Heal Powder and Energy Powder (-5,-5,-10), Energy Root (-10,-10,-15), and Revival Herb (-15,-15,-20) will cause it to lose a large amount of Friendship. This can potentially undo hours of Friendship work in just a few minutes. Do all of your healing and reviving at a Pokémon Center, which does not affect the Friendship level.

, Trading your Golbat will reset it to 70 Friendship. The only time this is useful is if you've lowered your Golbat's Friendship below the base 70 points.

Pacifidlog town is west of Route 131, and is encountered later in the game than most areas.;
, If you don't have a Mach Bike, you can't catch Rayquaza at all, as there are weak spots in the floor that will sink you if aren't going full speed on the bike.

, You'll need to hit the ocean in order to get to Rayquaza, but this should be common by the time you're ready to fight the beast. If you don't have a Pokémon in your party with Surf, grab one from earlier in your adventures.

, Rayquaza is the most powerful natural Pokémon you'll find in the game and is already at lv70 when you encounter it. In order to weaken it enough to capture it, you'll need some Pokémon that can hold their own against a high-level monster.You can get Rayquaza either before or after the Elite 4, it is your choice.

, This is probably your best chance to use the Master Ball, which will capture Rayquaza automatically, no questions asked. But if you don't have it anymore, Ultra Balls will do, so long as you have a strong team capable of weakening him/her first.

, These moves make it much, much easier to successfully capture the Legendary Monster, and they prevent him from fighting back for a few turns. Note, of course, that the higher-level the Pokémon using the move is, the more likely it will succeed.

, In the main quest, you'll meet Rayquaza the first time you go to Sky Pillar. It'll immediately fly away, but you see him again later when he fights Kyogre and Groudon. In this necessary cut-scene (unlocked by flying to Sootopolis after awakening Rayquaza), Rayquaza appears and breaks up the fight, then flies away. As soon as this is finished, you can return to the Sky Pillar to catch Rayquaza for real.


If you haven't gotten this far in the quest, you can't catch Rayquaza."

Use them to move up to the top layer. Whenever you see cracks on the floor, use the Mach Bike to quickly skate over them without stopping. You'll fall through if you try to walk or stop.


The Sky Pillar stages are filled with strong Pokemon, but they can be avoided if you use a Max Repel. This is a good way to save your Pokemon's HP for the big battle with Rayquaza later.

, You only get one chance to catch Rayquaza, so you need to make sure you save in case you fail the first time. If he escapes, defeats you, or faints, you're out of luck. That is, unless you can re-load the save right before the fight., Moves like ""False Swipe"" and ""Tackle"" are good for dealing only a little damage at a time, preventing you from accidentally knocking him out and never catching Rayquaza.


If you're throwing the Master Ball, toss it out on the very first turn. It will capture Rayquaza automatically for you!

, Throw down one of these Status Affecting moves, then just start chucking. Ultra Balls, even when they fail, make the next ball more likely to succeed. Even if the first few don't work, don't feel like you need to weaken the monster even more. Keep it asleep or frozen and just keep throwing Ultra Balls until it is yours."

Recognize the types and type-advantages.,
Be able to have Strengths against as many if not all the Types.,
Difference in Philosophy and Trade Offs: Other than the obvious lack of Legendary Pokémon, some additional changes to the roster have been made.,
Conclusion: In the end, the final decision of which Pokémon represents your party is up to you.",How to Make the Best Generation One Pokémon Team," There are 15 types of Pokémon in the first generation : Water, Fire, Grass, Poison, Fighting, Flying, Dragon, Ice, Ghost, Psychic, Normal, Electric, Rock, Ground, and Bug. Each has its strength and weaknesses, and some have only one type while some Pokémon possess two types. For example, Poliwrath has a unique Water/Fighting type, Onyx has a Rock/Ground type, Gengar has a Ghost/Poison type, while Ninetales is a pure Fire type, Machamp is a pure Fighting Type, and Tangela is a pure Grass type. Having multiple types gives a Pokémon versatility and vulnerability, i.e. they will have the strength and weaknesses of both types. Type-Advantages are simple enough to find on the Internet, and I don't need to address that now.;
, If your party can be versatile enough to combat and command strength against all the types then your party should rarely fail if the levels between the two parties are not grossly skewed.


Battles that include Legendary Pokémon versus Battles that exclude Legendary Pokémon. Legendary Pokémon have Legendary stats: stats that are considerably higher than more common Pokémon because there are only one of them in existence. Mewtwo, Zapdos, Articuno, and Moltres are only 4 Legendary Pokémon in the First Generation. Some include Mew in this category, but technically, his stats are not Legendary, he just boast insane special stats and the ability to learn any TM or HM. Some competitors will allow the use of Legendary Pokémon, while other venues will not. So in order to fit the occasion, it is recommended to assemble a Team for each case.
Ideal Assembly of Types: The types that will need to be assembled to combat all 15 types with 6 Pokémon are as follows:

Psychic Type: strong vs- Poison, Fighting, and any resulting hybrids. Weak vs- other Psychics. No adv against others
Water/Ice Hybrid: Strong vs- Fire, Grass, Dragon, Rock, Ground, Flying. Weak vs- Grass, Electric. No adv against others.
Electric Type: Strong vs- Water, Flying. Weak vs- Ground, Grass, other electrics.
Dragon Type: Has no Strengths against anything other than Dragon, but damage reduction from Electric Types (+) but only has one real vulnerability: Ice (-).
Fire Type: Strong vs- Grass, Bug, Ice. Weak vs- Rock, Ground, Water. Normal effect against anything else but other Fire types.
Normal, Fighting or other type: Be creative and add some diversity to your team.


Legendary Inclusive Assembly:

Mewtwo- Psychic Type- Psychic, Recover, Swift, Synthesis.
Lapras- Water/Ice Type- Sing, Blizzard/Icebeam, Surf, Slam.
Zapdos- Flying/Electric Type- Thunder, Thunder Wave, Drill Peck, Fly.
Arcanine- Fire Type- FireBlast/Flamethrower, Body Slam, Hyper Beam, Dig
Dragonite- Dragon/Flying Type- Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, Hyper Beam, Surf
Tauros- Normal Type- Earthquake, Fissure, Take Down, Hyper Beam


Legendary Exclusive Assembly:

Alakazam- Psychic Type- Psychic, Recover, Swift, Psybeam
Cloyster- Water/Ice Type- Icebeam/Blizzard, Surf, Explosion, Hyper Beam
Jolteon- Electric Type- Pin Missile, Thunder, Double-Kick, Body Slam
Ninetales- Fire Type- Confuse Ray, Fire Blast, Dig, Hyper Beam
Dragonite- Dragon/Flying- Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, Hyper Beam, Surf
Tauros- Normal- Earthquake, Fissure, Hyper Beam,



, No one can argue that Mewtwo is supreme in Generation 1, however Alakazam is not to be scoffed at. With great speed, versatility in TM usage, and BA Special Stats, Alakazam is rather imposing. For example, Cloyster, Jolteon, and Ninetales respectively replace Lapras, Zapdos, and Arcanine. This is done to make a point about the different philosophies on strength/versatility versus defense and speed. Lapras has an incredible amount of HP while Cloyster boasts the best defense. While there skill maybe comparable, Lapras will be able to weather more light hit and Cloyster will be able to endure through more powerful hits. Although Zapdos was replaced due to Legendary status, Jolteon would have been added in its place anyhow. Jolteon boasts unparalleled speed and does not share in the vulnerability to Ice Types. Also Jolteon has a vast array of attack making him particularly effective against Psychic and Normal Types, while Zapdos' Flying Type attacks give it an advantage over grass, bug, and Fighting, but also incurs the vulnerability. Lastly Ninetales makes an appearance over Arcanine. This is a heated debate at which one is more practical and deadly. Arcanine boasts superior stats, while Ninetales possesses better speed and the crippling Confuse Ray technique. It is a matter of preference, BUT when it comes down to clutch hits, Ninetales will be able to deliver more quickly albeit with less of a punch. Dragonite and Tauros do not change in my parties simply because they are the best of their types and deserve their roles. Dragonite only has one weakness even though it is a devastating one. And Tauros is a reliable damage producer that can learn almost any TM, not to mention pretty impressive stats. In my opinion, you cannot put a price on speed or defense, especially when they are coupled with more than adequate firepower to get similar results.

, I have made my case for the two scenarios and my choices for Pokémon, which do indeed hold advantages over all 15 Types. But above all else, be creative! Observe partiality for your favorite Pokémon, within reason of course. And go out and prove that you are a Pokémon Master. Thanks for reading, Ciao.

Gain access to Lacunosa Town by completing the Pokémon League.,
Once in Lacunosa Town, make sure you are stocked up on Poke Balls and healing items as the battle will be quite a challenge (it is level 75 after all).,
When you get there you will be greeted by the confusing yet quite small Route 13.,
If you started this event from Undella Town, your journey is much simpler.,
Once this is done, you will arrive at Giant Chasm.,
You will be introduced to an extremely large and complex maze for you to go through.,
After this sound, the ground will cover with snow (the roar was Kyurem and the snow was his doing in case you hadn't realized.,
Once inside the cavern, getting to Kyurem is a doddle.,
Once Kyurem is caught, exit the cavern and all the snow will have disappeared.",How to Catch Kyurem in Pokémon Black or White," Lucunosa town is located east of Opelucid City, at the end of Route 12.;
, Then take the exit on the right towards Undella Town via Route 13. (If you are coming from Undella Town, bypass Step 3). If you went this way, bypass Step 4.

, Once there, go south (battle the trainer if you wish to), go through the first patch of grass, preferably on the right hand side as you can collect an item (and avoid another patch of grass). Then hop over the ledge, and keep going until you reach the clearing. Then turn left and go down the steps, through the patch of tall grass and keep to the face of the cliff (to the hero's right). Make a left when you reach the end of the beach and walk up to the far-off set of steps. Climb them, and continue onwards to the Giant Chasm. Make sure you use HM Strength to move the boulder in case you lose to Kyurem so you can quickly access it again.

, You have to arrive at Route 13 (after stocking up of course), go up the steps and follow the beach, staying as far right as possible (but do NOT turn at the end of the second set of steps to go down the very narrow alleyway of sand as this will lead you back to the start of Route 13). Then you reach the steps and continue on (also making sure to move the boulder using HM Strength).

, It looks very simple at first, but many challenges await you. First you must enter the cavern in the middle of the entrance. Once inside you will be in a dark room. You may collect items if you wish (as there are a couple of rare items in the whole of the chasm), but the main goal is to reach Kyurem. Firstly you need to go all the way around the cavern and reach the exit (HM Surf is required at this point so make sure you have a Pokémon who can use this!). Once you exit, you will return outside.

, The objective is to get to the middle where a pond-like area of water lies. This looks impossible at first, but there is a way. To do this, the easiest way (without wanting to collect items) is to go as far North as you can from the entrance, then as far West, then as far South, then as far East, then as far North again (make sure you do not go over a ledge which takes you to a part where you have already been, as this mucks up the order). Then go through a patch of long grass and you will see the pond like area. Go to it and you will hear an Earthquake-like roar.

, This now gives you a clear passage to the exit and the final cavern in which Kyurem is inside. Walk through to the exit.

, Simply walk up to him and interact with him. As all legendaries do, it will roar, and the battle will begin.

, Then exit from the East and then walk South for the quick way (If you did not earlier this would be a great time to go back and collect items, in which case go back the way you came, collecting them on the way).

;
, So now you finally know where she is, you should know what she likes so you could win her heart. this is what she likes. :


Special Foods:

Truffle Rice, Cake, Cheese Fondu, Pancakes.


Favorite Foods/Things:

Egg dishes, Stew, Curry Rice, Strawberry Milk, Sandwiches, Sweets, Rice Cakes, Diamond, Pink Diamond, Perfume



, Ann and her dad Doug are greeting people as they come in the front door. Ann notices that you've decided to pay them a visit and asks if you would like a meal. You automatically agree, so Ann asks if you would wait a little bit and then says they're going to have a feast! Of course after she announces it she remembers to ask her dad if it's all right. Doug says you're a special guest so it's all good. Ann is happy and asks you to confirm if you would like to eat with them. Select that you would like to eat (option 1). Ann is happy so Doug says he's going to organize some delicious food for them. Ann says her dad's cooking is very yummy.Soon Doug happily returns with the food and you scarf it down. Ann and Doug both ask if you though it was good, which it was. Doug laughs and asks if it's hard to resist second helpings (of food), then he and Ann both giggle. After the meal is done, Ann sees that her dad is feeling pretty good. Doug says he likes to make things, then says you should come and meet with Ann more often! Poor Ann becomes embarrassed.
Purple Heart Event: Go up to the second floor of the Inn between 10am and 1pm on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday. In one of the rooms you'll find Ann, who appears to be practicing her singing. Enter the room and she'll become startled, unaware that anyone was listening to her. It turns out that Ann was really cleaning and she asks if you like to clean too. If you tell her you like cleaning, she'll be happy. Note: Before entering Doug's house, remember NOT to hold anything in your hands or the event won't come.
Blue Heart Event: If you go to the Inn on Monday or Friday between noon and 7pm, you'll find Ann and her Dad having a conversation. Doug asks Ann what is wrong but she replies that she's alright. Doug knows something is wrong because her face is very pale. Suddenly Ann starts complaining about stomach pains and Doug gets worried. In you walk and Doug is gratefully for your arrival. He asks what he should do, so tell him to take her to the Clinic. At the Hospital Ann is feeling much better. The doctor said that she had something bad to eat. When Doug asks Ann what she ate, she tells him nervously that she ate a Stir Fry, Omelet Rice, Savory Pancake, AND Tempura. She's not done though and admits she also ate some Cheesecake, Apple Pie, Cookies, Ice Cream, and some Pumpkin Pudding! No wonder she has a tummy ache! Doug scolds her for eating so much food and Elli tells her not to eat so much. Back at the Inn Ann says she's sorry for making a mess of things. To thank you she gives you her favorite broken music box.
Green heart event: You don't get an event. Just keep on giving her gifts.
Yellow Heart Event: Go to the Inn on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, or Sunday between 10am and 7pm. Doug will welcome you in and then says he has something to discuss with you. He says it's been difficult to raise Ann since her mother died and he's tried his best. Doug asks if you ""like"" his daughter. If you tell him you do (option 1) he'll be happy.Ann will then walk in and ask what the two of you are doing. Doug acts all innocent until she walks up next to you, then he start acting cheerful. Ann won't be fooled by her father and knows he's talking about her with you. She gets mad at him and runs off. Doug nervously laughs at her.
Orange Heart Event: You don't get an event. Just keep on giving her gifts.
Red Heart event: The Blue Feather will be for sale at Jeff's store. You can use the feather as a marriage proposal item when the girl you're after reaches the Red heart level. When you think she's ready, just equip the Blue Feather and press the B button. She'll accept your feather, visit your farmhouse, and then you two can wed 7 days later.

, When you're married: The wedding will take up the whole day, so there won't be any time for farming. But after the marriage, there is lots to do.


After Marriage: The next morning you will be with your new wife in your farmhouse. She will ask you what name you would like her to call you. You can choose from one of the default names or you can pick a new one. If you're married to Elli or Mary, she'll tell you that she's going to continue to work. If you're married to one of the others you can choose if she should stay home or go to work.
Mornings, Nights,Holidays or Special events after marriage: Your wife doesn't cook you breakfast in the mornings or dinner at night, but she will cook on special occasions like your birthday and wedding anniversary.
The during the daytime: Most of the time she'll just walk around the table all day long. She won't help you with any farm work either. Some of the festivals change because of your marriage.

, You don't even need to talk to everyone on the beach like you would if you were going to watch the fireworks by yourself. Just talk to your wife to start the festivities.
Fall 13 / Mother's Hill - When you weren't married, the girl with the highest affection would meet you at the top of Mother's Hill to watch the full moon. That's still the case even when you're married, so don't expect it to be your wife all of the time.
Winter 14 / Thanksgiving - Instead of receiving gifts from the other girls, you'll receive nothing at all. That's not so bad, since when you go to bed that night your wife will get up and make you some Chocolate Cake. Instead of leaving it on the table she will leave it in your Rucksack for you to find later.
Winter 24 / Starry Night - Instead of going out with your wife's family, the two of you have a nice party at home.

, She asks if you know what today is, so make sure you remember when your anniversary is! If you answer correctly, your wife will give you a gift.


After Marriage children: About a season after you two are married your wife won't feel well one morning. When you take her to the Clinic, Doctor says she's not sick but she's actually pregnant! Your wife will be quite happy about the new baby. Now you just have to wait 60 days until your wife gives birth. She'll go around her business like normal until the 60 days have gone by. On the morning of the birth, Doctor will come by and help with the delivery of your son. Now you may have a son although he isn't going to be much fun as a baby. Your wife will carry him around when she's home, but if she has to go to work then the baby ends up in the bed until she gets home. You can't talk to your son at this stage and you can't even give him gifts. After another 60 days your wife will wake you up in the morning. She says that when she woke up she found the child on the floor! Your baby is crying and looks like he might be hurt. Your wife will ask you what you two should do. You can reply that he'll be fine or if you think you should take him to the Clinic. If you tell your wife that he'll be fine, she gets mad at you and takes him to the Clinic anyway. The correct answer would be to volunteer to take him to the Clinic in the first place! When you all return home your kid now can crawl around. Once your little squirt starts crawling you can finally start to give him gifts to raise his heart levels. Your kid likes Cakes (Cheese, Hot, etc.), Ice Cream, Honey, Yarn, Grapes, Milk recipes, and Noodles.

She's a bit airheaded, but she's very understanding and cares deeply for your character.

, The controls in this game are pretty simple:


Use the control stick for walking, running, climbing, dodging, and moving the cursor (during purchasing or navigating your inventory.).
C button is for jump, double-jump.
Use Z button to re-center the camera.
Use the D-pad for eating and drinking.
The A button is to confirm, talk, investigate, and attack.
The Minus button accesses the quick equip menu.
The plus button access the pause menu.
Use 1 Button to view the map.
Use 2 button to teleport.
The B button is to pick up items or cancel.
Shaking the Wii remote calls your monsters to you.

, As you progress your game, you will discover that you will have your very own giant golem. Ymir can be used to navigate across the water to search for new islands. While using Ymir, you have different controls:


The control stick is still for moving around.
The C button is for blocking.
The Z button is to re-center the camera.
Pressing the D-Pad down enters or exit overhead view.
Pressing the D-Pad up stops controlling Ymir.
Use the A button to dash, go ashore, or punch.
Use the A button + B button to pound the ocean to reveal what's underneath.
The 1 Button is to view the sea chart.
The B button is to pick up islands or rocks; press it again to throw islands or rocks.

, The focus of the game is to find the solution on how to split your male character's body and Sonja's soul. You need to complete quests in order to progress; these you can obtain from the tavern's bulletin board.


People on the island will also give you tasks, such as clearing monsters, gathering items, crafting, and even cooking.
You spend most of your time conquering dungeons because nearly all the items you need for your crafting, and even cooking, can be found in dungeon chests and monster drops.

, As mentioned, taking quests from the bulletin board makes you progress to the next part of the game. The more you do quest, the more places you will discover and new islands will be available for you to conquer and farm for materials.


Monsters will get stronger as well, so make sure to level up and upgrade your weapon and armor.

, If you're wondering how to upgrade your equipments, you simply have to craft a new one or do quests with weapon or armor rewards.


Some of the NPCs in the town will also sell powerful weapons, giving you offers, and it depends on you if you want to buy it or decline.
Sometimes weapons sold by NPCs have satisfying bonuses and effects; sometimes they don't. If you have extra money, it’s best to take the gamble than regret in the end.
Crafting can be done in your home. If you haven't unlocked the smithing or tailoring area, talk to James during the bazaar. As mentioned, you will be needing materials in order to craft items, and a certain level of crafting skills is needed as well in order to create a higher level of equipment.
To make it simple, begin crafting at the start of the game so you won't have to worry about it in the later part of the game.

, In the later part of the game, you will discover how to tame monsters and let them take care of the islands you have unearthed. Some of the monsters can plant flowers, crops, and even trees while other monsters can mine ores for you.


These material islands are useful for gathering items, aside from conquering dungeons, and monsters you tamed can work as your assistant and will tend the plants and ores for you.
Monsters are not just for gathering and taking care of your islands, they can also join you during your dungeon conquering. Each of them has the ability to fight and cast magic.
The more you let them join you in your exploring, the more they level and grow stronger.

, Gold is important in the game especially when you need to buy food to regenerate your health or buy raw materials from the shop. To easily get money, buy milk from the inn and then cook it into hot milk. You can sell it back to them for an easy profit.


You can do this repeatedly.
It is most ideal to buy hundreds of milk when it's on sale.

, If you're still low in gold, another method to earn quick money is to buy yard balls from the general store and then craft them into hand-knit scarves. Sell it back for even more profit.


Repeat this until you're happy with the amount of money you have.
Crafting handknit scarves can help you level your crafting skills!

, If you have a higher level of cooking and crafting skill, you can make items that can be sold for a higher price.


Before crafting high-priced items, make sure that the materials can be bought from shops at low prices.
Add the price of each materials needed and then compare it to your income off the item you're going to sell. If you're earning 1 to 100, don't bother; it will be a waste of stamina and time.

To protect from damage later on, you should drive a car, truck or van instead of a motorcycle.
The random event will be incomplete if you shoot at the Lost members before they drive away.;
, When they take off in their van, chase them and shoot out their tires. If you’re having trouble aiming for the tires, shooting at the back of the van will eventually cause them to stop and exit the vehicle. When they do, shoot and kill them, then collect the ammo they dropped.An SMG is the best weapon to attack them with, as it fast and powerful at a distance, and can be fired from within a vehicle. Its features are very helpful during the pursuit, if you’re finding it difficult to catch up to them.
Don’t shoot at the gas tank. If the van catches fire and explodes, the random event will be considered incomplete.
When they exit the van, they will shoot at you with pistols and small machine guns. If you want to avoid damage, exit your vehicle and take cover behind it.

, Once she is safe, the girl will ask you to take her to Ineseno Drive in Chumash. Four more members of The Lost MC will show up on motorcycles and will shoot at you with sawed-off shotguns. Shoot to kill them, shoot at their motorcycles to stop them, or flee from them.If you are in a fast vehicle, such as a sports car, super car or muscle car, fleeing from them is the best option. This is because they can kill the girl by shooting through your vehicle’s windows, which would cause the random event to be incomplete.

, The navigation on your radar will lead you to the location of her house. Once you arrive, she will give you her thanks, but no reward.


Although you wouldn’t be saving her, if you are playing as Trevor you can take her to the Altruists Cultists. They will pay you $1,000 for taking her to them. Doing so would contribute to the total number people Trevor has taken to the Altruist Cult. After taking four people from random events, a new random event will unlock for Trevor, which leads to a large monetary gain.

Unleash the Hounds could be the most popular card in the Hunter’s deck for it can summon minions for each enemy minion on the board. Take advantage of this effect once enemy minions are starting to dominate you.
One of the most powerful traps is the Explosive Trap. This secret inflicts 2 damage on all enemy characters – including the enemy hero. This is a very effective board sweeper especially with enemy minions with small HP’s.;
, Lots of Hearthstone players agree that the Hunter deck is one the most powerful decks in Hearthstone. Why not? It is aggressive and very hard rush. Hunter cards work so good together and can be constructed very cheaply.


The Eaglehorn Bow plays a vital role in the Hunter’s deck. Not only does it inflict 6 damage for just 3 mana – it can also prolong its use every time Rexxar activates a secret, which the Hunter has lots of!
Include two secrets in your arsenal. The ever popular Unleash the Hounds and the situational trap Misdirection. Pairing Unleash the Hounds with the Starving Buzzard seems to be the best combo here for it also allows you to draw cards equal to the summoned hounds. Summoning the Timber Wolf surely adds to the injury for it buffs beasts’ attack. These secrets can also benefit the Eaglehorn Bow.
Some opponents will pull out lots of heavy taunts just to prevent your hounds to attack. This is when the Hunter’s Mark comes handy. This spell sets a minion’s HP to one. An easy kill even for a 1/1 hound.
Flare and Tracking will help you draw your essential cards. These spells are low cost and also gives Rexxar quick access to the cards you want to get. As bonus, Flare also cancels all secrets your enemy hero has. Ouch.
Kill Command is an easy 5 damage for 3 cost! Imagine that – with two Kill Commands, you can inflict 10 damage to your enemy (even the hero) as long as there’s at least a beast on your side of the board which is very likely. Now that’s what I call synergy.
Another dual effect card is Nourish. This card can actually be a life saver for it allows you to draw 3 cards or acquire two additional mana.
Some Hunter decks include Animal Companions for instant powerful beasts for just 3 cost. The downside of this is that it can be a random beast. So sometimes it can be a beast that does not actually suit your current situation.

, Neutral minions that help inflict quick and sure damages are welcome to this deck. Not necessarily beasts but still share the synergy of the Hunter cards.


Minions like the Wolfrider and Arcane Golem are easy picks since they are charge creatures with high damage infliction. These are important summons when you are just short of little damage to depleting your enemy hero’s HP.
The Abusive Sergeant for one drop can easily buff a minion to add damage to its attack. Combined with Leper Gnome, it instantly buffs its attack to 4! Add another 2 damage when the Leper Gnome gets destroyed. Not bad for one drop minions, eh?
In case there’ll be taunts in front of you, aside from the Hunter’s Mark, the Iron-beak Owls can help you cancel this taunt effect. The silence effect can also be handy to subdue minions with powerful effects like Ysera.

, The most suiting legendary for the Hunter deck is no other than Leeroy Jenkins, almost a favorite legendary minion for rush decks. It has 6 attack power and has charge for just 4 cost.


Play this along with Unleash the Hounds and it gives you two additional hounds from Leeroy Jenkins’ whelps on the opposite side.
Reserve Leeroy for the final kill, his damage can surely be fatal but he can be very vulnerable since he just have 2 HP. His whelps can easily destroy him on your enemy’s turn so make sure there’ll be no more next turn after Leeroy attacks.

Observe the enemy boss site.",How to Play Murky in Heroes of the Storm," In the early game, Murky is more of a nuisance than anything else. For the first few levels, Murky doesn’t have much more health than a creep, so any single hero in the game can kill him in a couple of hits. This is why it’s important to stay out of team fights at the start, because you won’t be able to do much more than throw a Pufferfish and run away. It’s best to stay to your lane and keep pushing because you’ll pressure the enemy team into leaving a hero to defend instead of joining the fight.
, It’s extremely important to know exactly when to use each skill, and how to combine them properly. Since you shouldn’t join team fights before level 10, you should stay on a lane and push while everyone else is fighting. Your trait allows you to set an egg that allows you respawn after you die, so it’s important to place it as close to the action as possible. Try to place it in hidden places, or behind your gate and towers, since it can be killed fairly easily.

Your Pufferfish skill is excellent for pushing, and if you aim it properly you can clear an entire creep wave or damage a tower plus the gate. Your Slime is a skill that does low damage at first, but increases if you apply it to an already slimed target. It’s spammable, so be sure to use it on creeps at all times. Your Safety Bubble makes you invincible for a short period of time, so use it to escape.

, Murky relies on his talents and skill more than any other hero in the game. His auto-attack damage is so low that most heroes won’t even feel an attack, so it’s important to select the right talents if you want to be able to contribute to team fights after level 10. His talents also help a lot with pushing, since they provide ability power that turns your Pufferfish into an excellent minion wave clear tool. Here’s what talents you should choose to go from a nuisance to a possibly dangerous hero:

Block at level 1 – 50% damage blocked from hero basic attacks may not seem like a lot, but it adds up as the game progresses. Adds a lot of survivability!
Living The Dream at level 4 – This is a talent that relies on you staying alive. If you can do that, the extra 15% ability power provided provides a lot of extra damage for pushing and harassing on lane.
Slime Advantage at level 7 – Apply a slime and then auto-attack an enemy hero to see the effect. 100% extra auto-attack damage to slimed targets means you finally pack a punch!, You’re going to die a lot as Murky, but it’s extremely important to have your egg close-by so that you can appear right back in the fight after several seconds. Hide your egg in bushes or in hidden areas to avoid discovery as much as possible. During team fights, enemy heroes won’t have time to start looking for your egg, so you’ll be able to die and re-appear numerous times, providing a real benefit for your team. You’ll see that after a while of doing this, the enemy team will simply ignore you, because they know there’s no point in killing you without killing your egg as well. Move your egg after team fights, because the enemy team will be looking for it in that area!

Warning: bad egg placement can lead to some disastrous games!

, First of all, here are the talents that you should get:

Octo Grab at level 10 – After taking this you will finally be useful in team fights! Cast this on the enemy damage dealer, and you’ll take him out of the fight for 3 seconds.
Continuous Slime at level 14 – Since most of your damage comes from your Slime skill, it’s only natural that you lower its cooldown with this talent.
Slimy Pufferfish at level 16 – This is basically an extra slime, right where you throw your Pufferfish. An excellent combo that goes even better with your ultimate.<rev> http:
These will truly turn you into a hero that is feared in the late game. Always be sure you have your Pufferfish off cool-down, and throw right under the hero you want to catch with your ultimate. This will not only stun him for 3 seconds, giving your team enough time to kill him, but it will also do a lot of damage once the Pufferfish explodes. This combo is enough to kill most fragile heroes such as Valla and Nova in one hit, if you’ve harassed them a little with your Slime before that.

, Murky can clear mercenary camps extremely quickly with his Pufferfish and Slime. Whenever you have the chance, run to a creep camp and clear it, because it will help with your push even more! You’re not able to steal enemy mercenary camps like stealth heroes can, so don’t try that. Just focus on your mercenary camps as soon as they appear.

Warning: the boss is an entirely different story, as you won’t be able to take him down alone.

, Upgrade your ultimate at level 20 and get ready to terrorize most assassins in the game. Your upgraded ultimate now does a lot of damage as well, and your Slime allows you to easily remove from stealth heroes. This means you can chase all stealth heroes without any problems, and actually kill them when you catch them. After level 20 Murky becomes extremely dangerous, and most players don’t realize this. Use this to your advantage!, Heroes will still be hunting you after level 20, even though the tables have turned a little. This is an excellent opportunity to ambush and kill them when they least expect it. You’ll see that most heroes will chase you even if they have low health, because they think you’re an easy target. Simply run into a bush, throw your Pufferfish, then use your ultimate when they enter, and you should be rewarded with a kill!, You can’t kill the boss on your own, but this doesn’t mean you can’t prevent the enemy team from getting the boss, after level 20. A Pufferfish thrown in the right location can cause the enemy team to run right into a boss stun. Combine that with your Safety Bubble and you may even be able to steal it if timed properly. Don’t be afraid to use your combo on enemy damage dealers if they’re low health, because it doesn’t matter too much if you die, but they probably have a 60 second respawn time."

Heed the number one rule of alliances.,
Make alliances in the lobby.,
If you have the higher ground or a better weapon, this is a good time to team.,
Don't betray your teammates.,
Hide.,
Use knockback.,
Block off water sources.,
Loot.,
Note that aggressive victories change the rules of alliances a bit.,
Charge!",How to Win a Game of Cloudy Combat," It is: Never request an alliance with somebody who has much better weapons than you. Even if they accept, the chances of betrayal are extremely high. However, if they requested the alliance, it's a good idea to accept.;
, This is a good idea because you don't know what sort of weapons you'll get. They may still betray you, but given that there's a chance your items will be better or the same, the chances are a bit lower.

, As the choice is accept or die, it will most likely be the latter.

, Firstly it's not that nice, secondly others will be less likely to team with you afterwards, and thirdly the dead teammate may return as a spectator to stop you from winning.

, It may sound obvious, but hiding until everyone else is dead actually works a lot better than you think.

, If you were lucky enough to get a knockback ink sac, then use it. It's a peaceful and relatively clear of ways to backfire.

, Be quick when you do this though, otherwise they'll swim back up. If you get stuck in a water source, make sure you have plenty of wood at hand.

, It's next to impossible to pull off an aggressive victory without good stuff. Kill people with good things, some maps have diamonds on the bottoms of islands––be creative!

, Don't request alliances and don't accept them unless the player has good loot. Moreover, it's up to you if you want to betray teammates, but as mentioned, this can easily backfire.

, If there is someone in your range, then go for them.

, Choose one of three different hero classes. The three heroes presented are random each time you enter the arena, so choose one you are already familiar playing if possible.


Each hero has a special power that can be played during battle. Check what the hero’s power is before choosing.

, Choose one card from a set of three at a time until you have a deck of thirty cards. The cards can be any card from the chosen hero’s card list as well as the neutral card list. The cards are not restricted to collected cards and can include nearly any card in the game.


Build your deck around the first few cards you choose, keeping in mind your hero’s ability.
If you choose to build a high cost deck, include cards that can protect you while you build up mana to play those epic cards. Good cards to include are healing cards, creatures with taunt, armor cards, and weapons.

, There is no time limit while building your deck. By reading the cards now, you will be familiar with them when it is time to do battle.

, Don’t be nervous! You will be pitted against opponents of similar rank and skill as you. You won't be playing against a veteran arena player until you are ready.

, You have the option to discard and draw new cards at the beginning of each match.

, The timer is in effect at this point in the game, so don’t spend too long reading cards. You should be able to easily recognize them because you read them carefully while building your deck.

, Choosing a strategy early in the game and during deck building can go a long way towards winning repeatedly. You want to have a solid plan in place when you begin to play but also keep yourself open to changing strategies based on what you draw during any given turn.


The 1-2 Strategy: This deck has many cards that require one or two mana crystals. A good strategy is to play as many creatures as possible during any given turn. Keep some creatures in reserve to block. When attacking, try to hit the player directly instead of focusing on their minions.
High cost deck: In the early game you will need to rely on your hero ability and cards that protect or heal you until you gain enough mana crystals to play the higher cost cards in your hand. This style of play is an advanced technique. It probably shouldn’t be tried till you have played in the arena a few times.
Spells: Use this strategy to do direct damage or to buff/heal you and your minions. Damage spells are also effective at taking out creatures with taunt. Playing minions that increase spell damage with this deck can enable you to do devastating damage to your opponent and give them limited options to block.

, You will continue to play with the same deck until you either lose three times or cumulatively win 12 matches. If you need to stop after a match, you can come back to the arena to keep playing until you have won or lost the set amount of times. If you forfeit during a match, it will count towards your number of losses.

, Each win upgrades your key which you use to unlock your loot chest. Losses do not downgrade your key; only wins are factored in.


Don’t forget to go and open your packs if you got any!

Go to http://www.naturalmotion.com/csr-racing/97, CSR Racing's webpage, to download your free CSR Racing game.,
Understand the structure of the game.,
Build a cash reserve using RR (Regulation Races).,
CSR Racing has two types of racing events.,
Buy new cars.,
Get started in Tier 1.,


,
Play the game.,
CSR Racing is not that easy though.,
Advance to the next tier.,
Work on Tier 5.,
To Beat Tier-5 (Errol).",How to Win at CSR Racing," Play the CSR Racing video there to get an idea of what to expect in the game.;
, This game is structured in tiers from Tier-1 to Tier-5. You advance through the tiers by winning races against some of the best opponents. You start the game racing in Tier-1 so you have to use a Tier-1 car. When you qualify for Tier-2 you have to buy a Tier-2 car. The Audi A1 is an example of a Tier-1 car. You can't use the Audi A1 in Tier-2 competition and so on. There is some overlapping though, for instance, you can use the Audi A1 in Tier-2 in a limited way. It is limited to RR Racing, to build cash in Tier-2 until you're ready to purchase the tier-2 car that you want to use for advancing to Tier-3.

, There are 3 levels of difficulty in RR, Rookie, Amateur, and Pro. The best way to build cash in RR is to select the difficulty level to suit your level of winning, or to match your cars level of winning. Of course, you can start upgrading your car to win more times per race, and build even more cash.

, One has a 1/4 mile race and another has a 1/2 mile race. Some cars will do best on a longer track, but another car will like the short track better. This depends mostly on the how you upgrade your car and how fast you are at shifting with proper use of the throttle.

, There is the temptation to buy more cars than you need but you can only use one car, for the most part, in one tier, and you can't sell your cars in this game. Your agent will randomly offer you a different deal, like 70% off on a new car. When she makes that offer on the car you want, accept it, it's a good deal. But don't buy 6 cars in the first tier, they will be just sitting unused, and you may only be able to upgrade the one used for competition.

, When you begin the game in the first tier, you are given a car to get you started. Usually it's a Dodge Dart and you won't have any money at first. You have to use that car to start building up some cash to buy the car you really want. The best way to build cash is to select ""Regulation RR"" play which will build up the most money the easiest way. It won't take very long to win $10,000 or $20,000 to purchase your new car.

,, You don't actually drive the car in this game. You only have to shift gears and control throttle at precisely the right moments to win some races. You should be able to build up enough cash to purchase upgrades for your current car, allowing you to win more per race. Then you can advance through this tier and purchase the car you want to drive for the next tier.  

, You start out with a stock car and the only way to win anything and go on to the next tier is to upgrade the car with horsepower and speed increasing items like new engines, turbo chargers, gear boxes, and even new tires for better traction. You will get pretty good at this in time.

, At some point you will have to defeat a Pitt Crew and their boss to advance to the next tier. The best way to handle this competition is to race one or two trials with the first crew member. If you lose, don't keep trying. You will really need to upgrade your car. You can purchase upgrades to the next upgrade level, then go back to try again. Repeat this until you can progress through the entire crew. At the same time, you can always go back to RR and get more money for more new upgrades.

, Tier-5 is the last tier (for now). It is also the toughest to win. You could win all tiers by using nitrous but you should be able to win without it, with determination, and clever upgrade selections. The toughest pit boss to beat is Tier-5 Boss; Errol.

, Practice increasing your shifting speed (this is important) and fully upgrading, to at least 702 hp, your BMW Z4 GT3, or equivalent car. With this preparation, you should be able to beat the last and toughest boss. Good luck.

Start by placing a Ninja Monkey where he can see as much as possible.,
After Round 2 on Impoppable, you should be able to afford the first upgrade, Ninja Discipline.,

Assuming you lived until after Round 15, place a Monkey Village to where it can see the Ninja Monkey and a space suitable to put a glue gunner.,
After Round 19, buy Double Shot for the Ninja.

,
As soon as you can, buy the mentioned Glue Gunner and place him within sight of the village, but as close to the beginning of the track as possible.,
After Round 34, buy Glue Splatter for your Glue Gunner.

,
By Round 40, you should upgrade the village.,

, You should be able to comfortably coast from Round 7 to the end of 15. If something gets scary, press the pause button and return to the main menu. Open up the save file and play in regular speed, holding road spikes at the ready for some stray bloons.

, I suggest stretching the distance between the Glue Gunner and the Ninja Monkey as much as possible, so try to account for that when placing the village. Eventually, the village will be (2,2).

,, Give the Gunner Bloon Soak, Stickier Glue, and the Acid Upgrade(2,1). Change the Gunner's priority to Strongest. Give the Monkey Village the Monkey Beacon upgrade and Monkey Fort. Eventually, the Glue Gunner will be (3,2).

,, Buy Jungle Drums and Radar Scanner. We are now done upgrading the village.

, Place one next to the Glue Gunner. Make sure the chipper is within the Village's range. Upgrade at your leisure for the next few rounds to get the chipper to (4,2). Set the Bloonchipper's priority to Strongest.

, There's a MOAB coming soon, but don't be afraid. That's what the chipper is for.

, We are now done upgrading the Ninja.

, We are done upgrading the Gunner.

, Literally. You should be safe until Round 60. If you can afford it, buy some Banana Farmers. If you get the Farmers, give them a range-boost with another village. Make sure to put as many of the farms within the village radius as possible to make them cheaper. You could make sure to buy all of the farms, you would be using first, and then upgrade them. Start with (2,0) farms, and once they are all (2,0), make one of them (4,2). After that, work at getting them all (4,2) one at a time. *Note*- When I was taking screenshots, I accidentally set my towers to Last instead of Strongest. That will cause many problems, especially when you have to face the Regen Rainbows of Round 56.

, Keep upgrading farms, and if you need to, sell one of them temporarily to build more Bloonchippers set to Strongest. This will get you through Round 84.

, Yeah, you read it right, sell it all. Count to five: . Build one village, and within it's radius, place two of each of the mentioned towers. Upgrade one super monkey to (3,2) and the other to (2,4). For the rest of the towers, buy the most expensive upgrades. Once all of the towers are upgraded, buy the Temple of the Monkey God.

, To race in the All-Star Race in 2006, gain an average of Gold in the All-State Qualifiers at the beginning so you can drive for a Sprint Cup team to race as a driver. If you are an owner, upgrade your pit crew even if you are using unlimited fuel and tires and racing in minimum number of laps (which is what this page is assumed). The reason will become clear later.

, Once you have done that, win at least one Sprint Cup race up to and including Dodge Challenger 500. Then on the Wednesday of the weekend, you will be asked to have a qualifying race, which you must win from last place just to get into the race, even when you have won every race in the season thus far. That day will clash with a Truck race. If you also own a team in the Craftsman Truck Series, hire a driver on the Monday of that week.

, The set up should serve you well for the week, and also the week after that. This is a non-championship race that has no championship points at stake, but next week's race at the same circuit does. So set it up well.

, The race proper is split into three segments. The first part is a 10-lap race that you will start from last on the grid (off a field of only about 11), but you must make a 4-wheel pit stop on a green flag lap.

, The best call is to pit earlier than everybody else. Pit after laps 1 or 2 because most never pit until late in the race. Your pit crew (even on perfect upgrade) needs a little more than 15 seconds to change all four tires... and that is not including the time you get into the pit lane at 70 mph (110 km/h) or less (or else you incur a time penalty), and out of it in full speed.

, For extended qualifying session, don't be disheartened if you are a lap down. When the others pit, you'll catch up to them if you drive cleanly. You may not know your track position with all the shuffling going on, but you should win comfortably if you pit early and keep the pace up.

, The field will be randomly jumbled at this point, and you will surely be shuffled back. This is basically the same as a qualifying race you did with a reduced field, but you have only seven laps to get as far up to the front as possible because this is effectively the qualifying session for the segment three: the race proper.

, Passing from the inside is easier than going the long way around.

, If you have unlimited tires and fuel, that's fine; but if you don't, you must make a pit stop, and the position you come out of it is what you'll start your final segment on. You have five laps to finish the job off. Stay inside, and stay out of trouble. Though, since caution flags do not count, watch out for any warnings. Don't go causing any yellow flags yourself.

, If you win, you've guaranteed yourself entry in this event for the next 10 years (so no more Wednesday qualifying), unless if you win again to extend the free pass. However, don't get complacent. As mentioned above, the race has no bearing on the Sprint Championship. On the next week, you will have a proper race weekend here (""Coca-Cola 600""). But of course, with a car nicely set-up, and you knowing the track very well, winning again 'should' be easier, unless if any rivals you made are trying to shunt you off. In this case, it's just like a normal weekend. Qualify well in the two laps given, then stay out of trouble to win. And DO NOT pit. Nobody will in a short race, and you'll be left behind.

Choose a crown tower to focus target and then attack it, but remember to defend too.,
When playing, let the enemy go first, or activate the card.,
Be sure to have a good deck.,
Always remember to take care and keep eyes on your tower.,
After the crown tower is destroyed, either attack main tower or attack the other tower.,When you knock both towers down, go after the King's tower.",How to Use Strategies and Tactics in Clash Royale1," It is most popular for people to push on the right lane so if you push left, it may help to catch them off guard.
, This is recommended so you can find their weakness. When their troops goes to your side, attack the troop. Remember that the more time you wait, the more time your opponent can place more cards and think., Use a card that will attack the towers such as fireball in case you're running out of time and your opponent won't let you get the final hits on the tower. Have a card that can attack air troopers like Balloon, Baby Dragon, Hordes, etc. Use a strong card like Mini P.E.K.K.A or Prince to eliminate high hit-points such as Giant and the rest should be based on ground troop. Use arrows well., Don't let your opponent reach them.
, Note its not recommended you go after the king, because if you do, your enemy will more likely attack your princess towers. Remember to build your hordes as countering and powerful to take out the other tower. Although you might or might not get a three crown, but you at least saved your trophies.,"
"
Use this method at the beginning of every match.,
Make good elixir trade-offs.",How to Use Strategies and Tactics in Clash Royale2," It is a great head-start advantage that should pack a punch on the crown towers! But take great precaution as your opponent may use the advantage of you losing a large part of your elixir.

Wait until your elixir is around or on the ten mark and then place down lots of troops with the elixir!
Remember, though, that the opponent might place down his troops too soon. Quickly place down a cheap troop and position it away from the crossing bridges so that the troops will get distracted quickly giving time.

, Use less elixir to counter a troop than it cost to place it.

Use a knight against witch, musketeer, and giant skeleton.
Use arrows against Minion Horde, but don't use it to counter goblins because they are two elixir and arrows are three.

"
"
Prepare a duo of troops.,
Grab the troop you have with the most lives and the troops you have with the most damage.,
Place down your Giant to distract the crown tower and troops.,
Act quickly if a skeleton army is used against you.",How to Use Strategies and Tactics in Clash Royale3," This method requires quite a lot of elixir but it is very useful for attacking crown towers and allowing at least a troop to attack while guarding opponent troops attack the other., You may also take a summoner behind the tank. For example, you might use a Giant and Witch or Musketeer., Place the Witch or Musketeer behind to attack the crown tower and hopefully destroy it!, The Giant and Mini P.E.K.K.A duo can be easily countered by a skeleton army. To remove that army fast, before your duo is destroyed, drag arrows or Zap spells and follow the duo with it. Use it when someone places a large infantry group."
"If you're using Tombstones and Goblin Huts and want to make them last, place them behind the King.,Place it on the desired side of the opponent's area you want applied to the King.",How to Use Strategies and Tactics in Clash Royale4,","
"When your opponent placed down a highly durable troop, place any card of your choice.,
While they are hitting the troop, keep placing more troops really fast.",How to Use Strategies and Tactics in Clash Royale5,", Before you know it, you'll have a collection of cards, provide your hoard with a tank and you will have a greater chance of victory."
"
Simply place a troop behind the crown tower that shoots, like Musketeer, Witch, Wizard, Princess, Ice Wizard, etc.,
If they have multiple troops attacking, place a durable troop for distraction (eg.",How to Use Strategies and Tactics in Clash Royale6," The crown tower will act as a wall for your troops. Now you have a double team fighting your opposing troops!, P.E.K.K.A).

The way you or someone might use it is to place the shoot troop on the battlefield to distract the opposing troop. That's the most common mistake and the hard way. The troop defending will soon be killed but this method protects the troop. So go ahead and give it a shot!

"
"At the start of the game, wait for your elixir to fill up.,When your elixir is full, choose the troop that does the most damage (like a Giant, for example), and spawn it.,
Spawn your next two most damaging troops.,
The three troops should destroy the first tower.,Keep slamming your opponent until their middle tower is destroyed.,
*Keep in mind that these combos may be countered and defeated if there is a shared weakness.",How to Use Strategies and Tactics in Clash Royale7,",, eg. the most used strategy is a witch and a musketeer., While your elixir keeps filling up, spawn more troops with their focus on the King's tower.,, For example: If you use mini P.E.K.K.A and prince, your opponent can simply place a skeleton army to counter your push for six less elixir."
"
Use Minions and Baby Dragons when someone uses a Balloon.,
Use the Zap spell against the Skeleton Armies.,
Use Goblins, Skeletons, or anything fast to push the giant, if you want your slow, tank troop to go faster.,
Use the Rocket when people use those pesky spawners.,
Use the Fireball against Barbarians and Witches.,
Use the Princess to take out Spear Goblins, Goblins, Minions, Archers, etc.,
Use the Bomber wisely.,
It is best to destroy spawners with spells as they can be launched anywhere on the map .,
Use a highly durable troop if someone places a Minion Horde just after your Wizard or Baby Dragon is down.,
Counter a P.E.K.K.A when you need to!,
Make your opponent have second thoughts to Inferno Towers!",How to Use Strategies and Tactics in Clash Royale8," If you don't have that, you can alternate with the Musketeer. Avoid using Minion Hordes as they can be countered with Arrows. (Since Arrows only cost 3 elixirs and Minion Hordes cost 5 elixirs, your enemy will have an advantage of 2 elixir.) Mega minion is a better choice because it cannot be arrowed., It only costs two elixir and it is faster to strike than Arrows, but you have to be accurate, as the Zap Spell has a shorter range.

The Zap Spell can do more than just smashing multiples of enemies! If your opponent places down annoying Inferno Towers and Sparkys, use the Zap Spell to freeze them for a split second! It will reset their charge giving you more time to destroy it. Use it at the right time though.

, The Valkyrie and the Prince deals massive amounts of damage! Just use the Prince to push the Valkyrie. Also the Valkyrie and Goblins is a good duo as the goblins can push the Valkyrie but the duo is counter-able with flying units., The Rocket when used statistically can deal a large amount of damage within a group of highly durable troops , but the Lighting Spell is good too because it will zap up to three targets at once with long range which is really handy., The Fireball allows an Arena Tower to finish off the Barbarians and Witches because they have almost no lives left. Other troops that can be fireballed are Ice Wizard, Wizard, and Mega Minion., Also, use the Baby Dragon to take out Barbarian Hordes and Fire Spirits., It throws Bombs that actually deal a lot of damage! They throw from a distance while is handy, so if you want to take out Barbarians, you can substitute the Valkyrie for a Bomber. Just remember to place it a distance away from a enemy troop group, as the Bomber doesn't really have lots of HP., Damage can be dealt to barbarians and goblins with Bomb towers , but the furnace is more cheaper than the Bomb Tower. Use it with caution however, because the furnace is a spawner, and the fire spirits it produces can be quickly destroyed before they launch their explosive attack!, You can place a Knight or a Valkyrie, for example. That will make the Horde attack it, giving your Arena Towers some time to land some hits on the Horde! However, this is not advised because the troop will be destroyed., Her weakness is that she walks too slow. Using a Knight, Skeletons, Barbarians, Goblins, or anything that is cheap and either durable or spawns a lot is the best counter strategy. A Musketeer would be great for supporting the troops attacking the P.E.K.K.A too!, If you place down a tank, you can also spawn a Battle Ram behind it, so anytime your opponent uses a Inferno Tower, or any other tower, the Battle Ram will rush forward and smash it up! Plus, you will also have 2 extra Barbarians to support the tank! Zap can reset an Inferno Tower's target and damage."

Create your own deck for the Priest.,
Don't waste the deck on high mana cost cards or spells only.,
Select a good number of spells and low-cost minions.,
Find minions with Battlecry, Deathrattle, or Charge.,
Choose minions with Taunts.",How to Use the Priest in Hearthstone1," A basic deck is not that powerful and contains only 20 basic cards. Visit the Hearthstone app on your device or computer, and log into your account. Click ""My Collection"" and select ""Create Deck"". Select the Priest and choose the right types of cards to create your own deck.;
, Minions can help more since usually spells just deal low damage, keep to the curve:

,


Choose good and powerful low-cost minions since when you have too many high-cost minions, you will not be able to put any good minions down in a battle at the beginning, and by then, the enemy will have several minions on his battlefield that you cannot destroy.
Find good quality spells that are helpful for the priest, such as ones that restore health, give """"attack"""" to other minions, weapons, or spells that destroy strong enemy minions. A good spell you can choose is giving """"attack"""" to other minions since the priest doesn't have many high attacking low-cost minions.
Choose a good number of spells and minions, and be sure they are balanced. 10 spells and 20 good minions would be helpful. 15 and 15 of each will also help.

, These can help you win a battle more easily. With Battlecries and Deathrattles, minions can do helpful things when they die or when they are put on the battlefield. Choose minions with Charge as well. Minions without Charge have to wait for the next turn when they are put on the battlefield to attack; while Charge minions can attack right away.


A minion with """"Battlecry"""" does something when it is put on the battlefield. This can be """"drawing cards"""", """"dealing damage"""", or """"giving other minions more attack power"""". It can also even be giving a minion """"Taunt, Charge, Spell-Damage or Stealth"""".
Add minions with """"Deathrattle"""" as well. These minions will do something when they die, and if it is severe, your enemy will probably not want to kill it, e.g Sylvanas Windrunner, otherwise keeping the minion on the battlefield and """"silencing it"""".
Charging minions can be useful as well. They can be used not only to attack the enemy hero right away but also to kill powerful enemy minions. Charging minions are almost made to kill an enemy minion and come another time, even when they die too.

, If a minion with Taunt is put on the board, the enemy will not be able to attack your hero until they kill the taunt. Minions with taunt act as a shield for your hero, and if you have several of them, you're in luck.


Find more low-cost minions that have Taunt, even if they don't have much health. The Goldshire Footman is a good choice, as well as the Ironfur Grizzly. They can still be hard to kill when the battle just starts since there is not a lot of mana for cards to kill the taunt.
Choose Taunts with a lot of health, along with some spells that might be useful. Most Taunts have health like 6 or 5. Those Taunts can be helpful, especially if you have some spells you can use to reinforce them. Spells like the ones that double health or give Divine Shield/more attack and health can be helpful, since it makes the Taunt harder to kill.

Review the cards you have drawn.,
Wait until your turn.,
Save good cards.,
Heal your hero and minions only when needed.,
Don't run out of cards.,
Use spells when necessary.",How to Use the Priest in Hearthstone2," Be sure they are low cost. If they are too high cost, are all spells, or just won't help out in any way, remove them. Look at the new cards you draw and make sure they are good. If they are still a high cost in mana, it's best to try to exit this battle and try another one.

, If it is your turn, it is normal to just end your turn without doing anything. However, if you have something good to start off with, choose it and put it on the battlefield. A good one you can start off with is a one cost Taunt, or a one mana cost charge, such as the wild boar. You can also put down a 0 cost card if you have any.

, Some cards that have high attack or is a good spell/secret can be exciting to put down to defeat your opponent. However, your opponent usually will have spells such as Execution, (this is a spell that destroys a minion no matter if it has Taunt, Divine Shield, etc.). They can also have cards that change a minion's health to 1, which makes it easier to kill. Put down your good cards when it seems that your opponent doesn't have any more spells or has run out of cards.

, Don't always heal yourself when you have the chance to deal damage that turn. Heal it when necessary, such as when you are low on health, or a really important minion is about to be killed. Put down minions that can attack, but can restore health as their Battlecry if you really need to.

, Do not put down a lot of cards that draw more cards or discard cards. You get about 25 cards in your deck, and if you run out of cards, you will easily lose the game since when you don't have any more minions to put down, your minions will be killed, and nothing will be left to fight with.

, The Priest doesn't have many spells, so it's best to use them only when needed. Put down spells after you put down a minion if it gives """"attack"""". Use spells that restore health on your hero when it is low on health, or when an important minion you need is about to die.


Choose good secrets to put down. There is a number of secrets that each hero should have. Since the Priest uses other strategies using mostly minions, it doesn't have many secrets either unless you get them using Kezan Mystic. Use them only when they're really needed since they are in short supply.

Use potions.",How to Use Potions in the Legend of Zelda," Every town in every version of the game has a shop you can buy potions from. Just approach the attendant to buy one. There are three types of potions you can buy, namely:


Red Potion – Costs around 30 Rupees. When used, it refills one of Link’s heart containers. It’s the generic type of potion, available in all versions of the game.
Green Potion – Costs around 30 Rupees. When used, it fully refills Link’s magic gauge. Green potions are available in games where Link can use spells, like A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and The Wind Waker.
Blue Potion – Costs around 100 Rupees. It has the combined effects of a red and green potion. It can refill all of Link’s heart containers and the magic gauge all at the same time. Just like with green potions, blue potions are available only in games where Link can use spells, like A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and The Wind Waker.;
, If you want to save on Rupees, you can get free potions from treasure boxes found in dungeon rooms. The type of potions you can get from treasure chests are at random, however, and it’s not a 100% chance that you’ll get one.

, Killing low level enemies, like Moblins or Octoroks, can sometimes drop potions. However, just like obtaining one from treasure chests, it’s only by chance and at random that you’ll get a potion., Press the “Start” button on your controller to open Link’s bag and show your character’s item inventory.

, Use the arrow keys on your controller to move around the inventory list and highlight the potions. Once selected, press the Action button where you want to assign the potions to, and press the “Start” button again to go back to the game screen.

, Back in the game screen, press the “Action” button where you assigned the potion to and Link will use it, replenishing his heart container, magic gauge, or both.

Map your carny holes before you start the level: Carney holes are the small nooks and crannies in a level that improve your tactical standing.,
Use Splash: If you have in your hands a rocket launcher or splash weapon, the best target is not the torso or the head; the best target is usually an enemies feet.,
Use Baseball: On rare occasions, a game may include a splash melee weapon.,
Use the Bouncer: For cripes sake, lead your enemy with grenades!,
Use the Tapper: When you have to fire a machine gun at long range or dual machine guns, it is often better to tap the trigger to maximize your damage.,
Clear Screen Tactics: Never underestimate the true value of a small weapon.,
Use Screen Peeping: The best players are screen peepers, admitted or not.,
Take advantage of Visual pollution: Some games allow you to throw weapons.,
Understand Hierarchy: Very simply, have a firm understanding of the weapons that suck.,
Feign death: Some shooters allow you to feign death.,
Strafe Melees: These attacks work on newly introduced shooters who have their sensitivity turned down terribly low.,
Use Grenade Donkey Punch: Some shooters allow one to throw their opponent back with splash damage.,
Use Grenade Jumps: Although very common, grenade jumps are often misused.,
Control Sensitivity: It is a good practice to have your control sensitivity turned up very high.,
Use Flag Armor: A good practice is slowly shoot your enemy when he has a flag.,
Sneak around: In some FPS, one team has objectives that can be captured.",How to Use Advanced First‐Person Shooter Game Strategies," For instance, the top lips of doorways, the shade of an overhanging pipe or even the old hide in the enemy base trick.This can be just as enjoyable as playing the game. Whether it's hiding in a tree in Halo 3 or hiding on top of the door in Call of Duty Four.;
, Rockets, after all, are easy to dodge. However, an enemy under normal circumstances cannot dodge splash damage which, due to proximity, may kill them regardless of a direct hit.

, In even rarer circumstances, that weapon may have a direct effect on projectile weapons. Let's face it, Halo 3 is the only forthcoming example, but don't forget about such an advantage. A rocket, grenade, or even a sword wielding enemy can be fouled by a properly timed hammer strike.

, Many a new player has died for lack of consideration. A well bounced grenade or leading grenade will inevitably kill an opponent intent on moving forward.

, With two buttons and two machine guns it is also a good consideration to alternate triggers, one side, then the other in rapid succession.

, In short, smaller weapons allow for more view-able gaming area. For instance in Halo Two, one could argue that dual pistols allow a greater viewing area than the battle rifle, therefore adding advantage to a closer quarters battle.

, This is due to two separate advantages. By looking at another player in split screen, you can identify your tactical advantage in reference to the other player. Also note that your peripheral vision is better at picking up movement; therefore, many screen peepers are able to play two screens at once and still easily win.

, Throwing your weapon at your opponents neck will most likely provide enough visual pollution to give enough time to finish them off.

, That may not be measured universally, but on your own skill and merit. Some are better snipers, some are better flak monkeys. Adjust your hierarchy as such.

, The irony is that most people do not know that. Map your controls and have that one handy. Lying on the ground with your tongue hanging out can have three effects. First, is that your enemy will walk right over you allowing you to easily shoot him in the back. Second, you will be accused of hacking or ""popping out of the floor."" Third and most likely, if they do figure out what is going on, they will waste ammo on every corpse they come across. Giving you even more to laugh about.

, Ironically, you can beat them whilst running circles around them.

, Whilst following an enemy, throw a grenade in front of them whilst running forward. The resulting blast should throw them backwards into your awaiting melee strike.

, When one is being ""lightly"" shot at from behind, a well placed grenade can, with practice, epically throw you over a wall or other impediment that places you out of the reach of your potential killer.

, This is for two reasons. One is to provide easy multi kills and draws against multiple opponents. The other advantage is to be able to address a potential killer to your rear. A person with low sensitivity would stand little or no chance in such a scenario.


Get used to small jerky movements with your hands. A good tip with a mouse is to have your lower palm straddling the end of a table for leverage and quicker movements.


, In this, your objective is not to kill but to goad your enemy into seeking good defensive cover where you should then kill him. This is to give your teammates a decent position to defend the flag as it respawns.

, They are assigned to defend these. If you happen to be the last person left that round, and there are several other enemies, some of who are camping, you might want to sneak past their lines.


Do this by first firing wildly into the air, so the enemy knows you're there. Then, take the longest way to the objective as possible. The enemy, hungry for more blood, will attempt to take the shortest way to you to kill you and win the round. Thus, you will bypass the restless defenders, and it will be easier to win the round as last man standing.

Talk about the social effects in your life.,
Discuss the mental benefits of video games.,
Explain your new skills.,

Ask for support.,
Play together.",How to Talk to Your Wife About Video Gaming," One of the hardest parts of talking about difficult topics is opening the discussion. You may feel nervous or full of anticipation. Before you speak, think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. Whatever it is that you’re wanting to talk about, put some thought into it. Use “I” statements and say, “I want to discuss my feelings about gaming and why it’s important to me” instead of “Gaming is important to me and I don’t want you to take it away from me.”Choose a time when both of you are calm and not rushed to do anything.
State what you want upfront. Say, “It would mean a lot to me if you understood gaming, and I want to share it with you.”;
, Don’t assume how your wife feels or how she will respond.Your wife may not respond in the way you assume, so let her be free to have whatever reaction she has. If you’re not sure about something, ask.


For example, instead of saying, “Well, you’re always upset when you see me playing video games” instead say, “Does it make you upset when I play video games?”

, Don’t make the talk all about you. Take time to notice how your wife is feeling and responding. Acknowledge her feelings both in the moment and in relation to your gaming.Look at her body language, facial expressions, and nonverbal cues. Check in to see if you’re interpreting her feelings correctly.


Say, “You seem upset when I play video games all day and you’d rather me do other things. Is that right?”

, Intentional dialogue incorporates listening and speaking techniques that can help foster healthier communication between you and your spouse. Start by repeating your wife's concerns so that she knows you understand her. Then reaffirm her concerns and acknowledge that you want to work on exploring ways to address them.Express empathy for her perspective as well as yours, so that she knows you value and appreciate her. Don't be afraid to ask for similar empathy in return. Allow her to feel heard instead of trying to make her feel wrong.

, If your wife has not spoken or shared how she feels, ask her to respond to what you’ve said.If you want a response about what you’ve said or how you feel, ask for her input. However, be ready for whatever response she may have!


Say to your wife, “I want to be honest with you and share how I feel. I’d like to know how you feel, as well.”

, You may not feel great after your conversation or you may need to have more than one conversation.If you’re hoping for a certain response, don’t get your hopes up. Be ready to keep discussing things and to hear your wife’s feedback. You may also need to make changes once you find a resolution.

, Video games may play a larger role for you than just entertainment. For example, you may play video games as a way to socially connect with others.Perhaps you play video games with your friends or use video games as a way to make new friends. Tell your wife the benefits you receive from playing video games and why you find them so enjoyable.


Say to your wife, “I find video games fun and challenging. My group of friends enjoys interacting through gaming and it’s a way that we connect.”

, Studies have shown that playing video games can improve mental functioning. For example, video games can have positive effects on perception, attention, memory, mental flexibility, and making quick decisions. Video games can improve hand-eye coordination and improve reflexes.You may enjoy the challenge of beating a level and trying multiple ways of doing something better.


Let your wife know that video games aren’t all about wasting time or aggression and that you enjoy practicing different skills.

, Beyond questing, video games can help you learn new skills. For example, you can learn how to play an instrument, practice dancing skills, and learn yoga all through video games. Talk about the positive effect these have had on your life and what you’ve gained from them. Say what you’ve enjoyed about learning new skills through video games.


For example, if you’ve enjoyed learning to play an instrument, say, “Learning to play the guitar through a video game has been fun and enjoyable. I like knowing I can take a class any time I want to and don’t have to wait for a teacher. I’ve been able to go at my own pace and learn songs I enjoy.”

, While no psychological disorder exists to classify a gaming addiction, it can be considered an impulse control disorder.If you think you may be addicted to gaming, talk about this with your wife. Some signs of addiction include:The impulse to play for longer periods to feel satisfied
Postponing or disregarding your daily responsibilities and personal well-being so that you can focus on gaming
Feelings of withdrawal when you are unable to play
Others expressing concern or complaining about how much you game

, If your wife is upset with how much time you spend gaming, make a compromise. Your wife may feel like your time with video games steps over time she’d like to spend with you. Find an agreement that both you and her feel is fair. Be willing to acknowledge your wife’s desires without sacrificing your own.You may spend one hour a day playing video games, or play video games on the weekends and not on the weekdays.


Say to your wife, “I know we have different views on gaming. I want to respect your desire for me to play less, so let’s find a compromise we both can agree upon.”

, Ask your wife to support you in making changes to your video game habits. Instead of guilt-tripping you, ask her to notice when you do things right, not wrong. For example, you may want encouragement, appreciation, and praise. Ask your wife for the kind of support you’d like to receive. Say to your wife, “It’s not easy to make these changes. Please support me in making these changes by encouraging me and noticing when I’m doing well.”

, If your wife dislikes video games, invite her to join you in playing a 2-player game. You can also invite some friends over to play in multiplayer games. She may be hesitant to join you, but let her know it’s important to you and that you’d like her to join. Invite her into a part of your world to experience it together.


Say, “I’d like you to play with me this weekend. It would be nice for you to see what I enjoy and for us to experience it together.”
Choose a game that’s engaging and interactive. Have fun and maybe even invite a bit of competition!
If you do begin to game together, don’t make gaming the only time you spend with your wife.Notice her and give her attention outside of gaming.

, On the welcome screen, tap the “Play” button at the bottom. You will be brought to the many different worlds inside Plants vs Zombies 2. You can swipe left and right to see all of them. Each world has its own theme. You will see: Ancient Egypt, Pirate Seas, Wild West, Far Future, Dark Ages, Big Wave Beach, Frostbite Caves, and many more to come.

, Tap the watering can button on the header menu. This will take you to your Zen Garden. The Zen Garden can contain a maximum of 12 pots. You can put and grow one plant on each pot.

, In order to grow a plant in the Zen Garden, you need to have sprouts. Sprouts are another type of currency and reward in the game, similar to gems and coins. Each sprout can be planted in a pot in the Zen Garden. You can see your total number of sprouts on the header, right beside the plant picture. Tap on an empty pot to plant a sprout.

, Each sprout you plant generates a random plant. You cannot control what plant comes out. Once the sprout is planted, you can see the plant appear.

, Plants in the Zen Garden need watering. A water droplet will appear beside a plant that needs watering. Tap on it, and a watering can will appear and pour water over it.

, After a plant is watered, the time until its next watering will appear. You can see the time in a black box in front of the plant. You need to water a plant in the Zen Garden twice before it fully matures and can be used. A water droplet will appear again on the plant when the time comes.

, Every now and then, you will see a bee flying over your Zen Garden, usually over the first row of plants. The bee has some magic that you can use to shorten the time required for the plants to grow. Tap on the bee, and it will be temporarily frozen in place.

, Plants that are still growing will be highlighted after you tap the bee. These are the ones that can benefit from a little bee magic. Tap on a plant, and the bee will go to the plant and sprinkle it. The time needed for the plant’s next watering will shorten.

, The bee can only use its magic one at a time. After it sprinkles a plant, it will go to its corner and sleep for a bit. You cannot apply its magic right away. Once the bee is re-energized, it will fly again. You can then tap it again to apply its magic on another plant.

, Continue growing plants and using bee magic until the plants have fully matured.

, After you’ve watered a plant twice and the required duration for its growth has passed, a picture of the plant with a bright orange background will appear in front of it. These are the plants that have already matured, and you don’t need to water them anymore.

, Tap on the picture of the plant, and a message will appear indicating that the plant now has a boost of Plant Food. Tap the “Boost” button. The next time you use this plant in your game, it will automatically come with a boost of plant food that will last for one level.

Leave your DS/PSP in your room before bedtime.,
Make sure no one awake is on the same floor.,
Be aware as you play.,
Hide your handheld quietly and quickly.,
Don't stay up too long.",How to Stay up Playing a Handheld Video Game Console," This way, you don't have to sneak it up and risk even getting to play at all. But if you do forget to leave it in your room, you can try one of the following:


Put it your pants pocket. This is your best bet, since most people won't be looking at your pants. But if your pocket bulges a bit, try covering it with a long shirt or sweater. NEVER use a shirt pocket unless you can cover it with a loose sweater.






Use the ""sneak hand"" technique. To do this, hold your DS/PSP behind your back with one hand. If someone passes you, you need to swiftly move your game hand to a side where they can't see it. For example, if someone's going the opposite direction of you, you would move your game hand back, side, then front. I suggest practicing with someone you trust before attempting this.






If all else fails, put it in your underwear. As disgusting as this sounds, this will actually work better than the pocket technique. Try suggest wearing loose pants or a long shirt/sweater cover it. Just make sure it's your DS/PSP and you go to the bathroom first, for obvious reason.





;
, Obviously, you wouldn't want to start playing when a parent is in the hallway. Make sure everyone on the same floor is either gone or asleep.

, This is the hardest part because you have to focus on your game while still being aware of what's happening outside your bedroom. Here are some things to do while playing:

If you hear footsteps or voices approaching or see light coming through your door, HIDE YOUR HANDHELD IMMEDIATELY. They may come into your room to check on you.






NEVER, and I repeat NEVER TURN YOUR VOLUME UP. Even if you have something like a radio to cover, there is that occasional silence in between songs where your game can be heard. Also, don't play games that require you to listen the game's music, like ""Rhythm Heaven"".






Be light when you press buttons. Only press the buttons as hard as you need to because button presses can be heard. This is even harder when using the Touch Screen of a DS. Nonetheless, tap it lightly.

Make a sleeping bag.",How to Survive in Rust," After joining a server or creating your own, your character will spawn at random areas of the map. You can find the status bar at the lower right of your screen. At the top part is where you can find your health. A very simple text of “Health: 100.”


You can reduce the amount of damage you receive by wearing armors.
Health can be restored by eating cooked food.
If your Health reaches 0, your character will die, and then a window will appear, making you choose to respawn (respawn near the place you died or in random part of the map) or go back to the camp.
When you die, all the items in your inventory will be dropped, including the basic tools you have when you first started the game.
Players who killed you can loot your body.
Aside from players, you will be facing wild animals as well, so be careful during your travels.;
, Just like in Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, and other multi-survival game these days, food has become a necessity. Calories, found under your health, determines the food and water satisfaction of your character. Your max calories is 1,500, and then this then gradually decreases as your character moves.


Once your calories reaches 0, your health will slowly decrease until your character dies.
To simply put, calories is your hunger meter.
When it turns night, and you do not have any type of clothing, your character will have a cold effect. In this state, you will lose calories faster than normal.
If you couldn't find any clothing, the best way to fight off the cold effect is by making a campfire. Standing near the campfire will give you the comfort effect, which makes your hunger to deplete slower.
To have clothing, you can either craft it or loot it from enemies or supply boxes around the world.

, Rads can be found at the bottom-right corner of your screen, just below the calories. Rads displays the amount of radiation you have absorbed. Radiation can be noticed by a Geiger counter sound (rapid clicking).


Once your character is exposed to radiation, your hunger will go down faster.
Once your character reaches +500 rads, you will gain radiation poisoning. You will start to lose health until you reach 1 HP.
To deplete your radiation level, leave the irradiated zone or take anti-radiation pills or food with anti-radiation properties, which can be obtained from loot.

, Gathering materials is easy since you already have the basic tool for hunting. Wood is one of the vital resources for your survival since it is used to make campfires, houses, storage containers, and many others.


Your main tool to gather wood is the Rock. To use the Rock, simply press 1 or the assigned shortcut slot for the item, which can be found at the bottom of your screen.
To gather wood, simply approach the nearest tree with the Rock equipped, then start hitting the trunk by right-clicking. You will then receive message on the right side of the game window notifying the number of wood you have gained.
Once the tree is depleted, another message will appear, stating that there's no more wood for you to gather. When this happens, simply move to another tree to gather more.
This is the easiest way to gather wood but not recommended. Your calories burn with less wood since per hit, and you only get 1 wood each.
Pile of wood is scattered around the world. This is the fastest way to get wood and also burns a small amount of calories. Pile of wood gives many more pieces of wood per hit than trees.

, This can obtained by breaking mineral rocks, which can be found around the world. You can use the Rock tool to mine until the resources is depleted.


These materials are required to create gunpowder and weapons.
Stones are also used for building campfire, which is why it's advisable that you gather stones as you search for any pile of wood.

, If you're willing to kill and loot players, then you have the option to become a bandit. Anyone can be a bandit by their choice, killing new players and then taking all the loot they have. This path can be fun, but needs a lot of preparation, such as having the proper weapon and decent armor.

, To hunt for fresh meat, you need to find an animal and then kill it. Using the weapon you have, you can use the starter weapon, kill the animal with it. Once your target is dead, swing your weapon at the corpse to get all the loot.


Rust is a developing game and still in their alpha. With that said, keep in mind that all meat you receive, regardless what animal you have killed, drops chicken meat.
You can gain cloth (which is useful for medicine kits, beds, and even creating a bow.), leather (from bears), blood (from wolf or bear), and many others.
If you don't have a decent weapon, kill rabbits with the Rock. It only takes two hits to kill it.
Chicken are easy targets as well. They run slower compared to rabbits.
You can also sneak behind the animals to prevent them from running. Simply hold left+ Ctrl.

, You can scavenge for canned food or rations from crates. You can also search for items and weapons inside the building, but while doing this, be cautious about your surroundings for many bandits camp nearby to kill new players in order to loot their items.


Most areas with buildings are irradiated. Proceed to your searching if you have enough anti-radiation pills.

, Shelter stands as your camp in the game. It will protect your storage and other items inside the house from thieves and bandits.


There are two ways to create a shelter; the first one is the basic wood shelter with 1,000 HP. It’s a small house that can be crafted using only wood. Though quick and easy to set up, it can be broken down by melee hits or grenades.
The basic shelter is great for new players that are still gathering materials for a better home.
To make a wood shelter, simply press Tab to open your inventory and then click the crafting button found at the upper part of your screen. This will enable the list of crafting items. Click the wood shelter to see the requirements.
You will need 50 wood to craft this.
After you crafted the shelter, simply equip the item and then choose a leveled ground for it to build.

, The second way to build a home, and much more tougher compared to wood shelter, is by building it using wood planks. Building a structure requires a lot of materials since 1 wood plank requires 10 wood. Compared to wood shelter, you will be crafting each part of the house to build it.


Wood foundation - You will need this before you can install the pillars. Wood foundation requires 8 planks.
Wood pillar - These are required to place a window, doorway, wall, stairs, and even ceilings. You can only build wooden structures between the wood pillars. You can craft wood pillar with 2 wood planks.
Wood wall - This requires 4 wood planks to create. Walls can be destroyed with 1 to 3 explosive charges. Walls do not take melee damage.
Wood doorway - This is where you can place your door. Before leaving a server, make sure to install a door for other players may place their own and claim the house you built. To craft a doorway, you need 4 wood planks.
Wood ceiling - In the current game, wood ceiling are not destructible. To make a ceiling, you need 6 wood planks.
Now that you have a shelter, you can start storing your items inside your home. It will be safe there. If your character dies, all the items inside the storage will remain, so make sure to put gathered materials inside your shelter before leaving to do more hunting or gathering.

, You are now set to survive longer compared to the other players in the game, but before you head out to kill players or do what is needed to be done, you must make a sleeping bag.


Sleeping bags give you a spawn point. If your character dies, you will be given an upon to respawn somewhere or spawn back in your camp (where you placed your sleeping bag).
To make a Sleeping bag, you need 15 cloth to build. Simply place it inside your home to activate the spawning point.

Choose a character that goes with your play style.,
Look for alternate paths when traversing a dungeon.,

Use the bonfires.,
Learn when and how to efficiently use souls.",How to Stay Alive in Dark Souls," Of course, this goes without saying; if you're the type to rush in head first, then a Mage class is obviously not for you. Always choose a class that you'll be able to play with your style. Here are some information that will let you choose which is best for you:


Knights have the highest amount of vitality among all of the classes. They also have a decent armor set at the beginning of the game. It's also the most balanced class, but of course, if you play as a Knight, you'll have to be up close and personal with the enemies.
Pyromancer are a Mage class, and Mage classes are well-known to be squishier than warrior types. The plus side on this job is that you'll be able to kill enemies from a distance, provided you can dodge well.
Using a Knight or Pyromancer is best for new players.;
, A general rule of thumb when it comes to Dark Souls is that when the path you're taking is too difficult, there's probably a better route to take.


Take your time and look around the areas; this may end up as a trial-and-error method, but certainly better than continuously charging at enemy mobs and dying.
This strategy also applies to boss battles. Some bosses like the Asylum will require you to think outside the box in order to beat it.

, In any hack-and-slash game, it's always important that you know when to block, hit, and occasionally run. Learn your enemy movements and strike when they give you an opening; chances are you'll be able to get away unscathed by carefully planning your movements in battle.


Occasionally running away from battle is nothing to be ashamed of, especially if you have to go through 40 whole minutes again before you get your souls back.

, Bonfires are the save point and checkpoint of Dark Souls.


Much like some other games (e.g., Witchers), you'll have to be at the Bonfire in order to level up; meaning if you die before reaching one, all your souls will be left at the place where you died—very, very frustrating.
Another thing about bonfires is that it will cause all the enemies that you've killed to re-spawn, thereby letting you conveniently farm souls!

, Souls are a very important element in Dark Souls; after all, without them you'll be stuck at level 1 with your newbie weapons. You’ll also be stuck with getting killed over and over, so use your souls wisely.


Souls can be used not only for leveling up but also for purchasing items, upgrading some items, or even crafting rare weapons (boss souls only). Good Luck!

One of the most popular free options is Open Broadcast Software (OBS). This program is completely free and open source, and can record as well as most commercial programs. You can download OBS Multiplatform for Windows, Mac, and Linux at obsproject.com., The installer is very basic, and you can leave all of the settings at their defaults. As long as you downloaded the program from obsproject.com, you shouldn't have to worry about adware., You can find this by clicking the ""File"" menu and selecting ""Settings,"" or by clicking the ""Settings"" button in the main window., This will allow you to adjust your basic video settings for your recordings. There are a few options that you'll want to take a look at:

Video Bitrate - This is the quality of the video. A higher bitrate will lead to a higher-quality image but lead to a larger file.
Recording Path - This is the location that recorded videos will be saved on your computer.
Recording Format - By default, this will be set to ""flv."" You may want to select ""mp4"" for maximum compatibility.

, This will allow you to assign specific keys to starting and stopping your recording. This will allow you to start recording while in the middle of a game., You can use single keys or combinations. Try to use a key that you won't be using in the game, such as one of the Function keys or a combination of Ctrl and another key., There are several things you might want to change before starting to record:Output (Scaled) Resolution - This is the resolution that your recorded video will be displayed in. A lower resolution will lead to a smaller file, but the quality will suffer. If you want the output to be the same as you see, set it to the same value as the Base (Canvas) Resolution.
Common FPS Values - This will lock the framerate of the video to the number you set (as long as your game can perform at that framerate). YouTube now supports 60 FPS video, so you may want to change this setting.

, If you want to record your voice along with the gameplay, you can check and enable your microphone on this tab. You can also enable push-to-talk for your microphone so that you can record your voice when the key is held.

Close the Settings menu after checking your audio settings.

, This will create a new Game Capture entry in the Sources list., Once you've got OBS configured, you can start playing your game. You can play any game on your computer from any source, including Steam, Origin, or games installed on their own., You won't receive any indication that recording has begun, but OBS will be recording in the background., Again, you won't receive a notification that recording has stopped. The video file will be created, and you'll be able to find it at the location you set earlier."

These consoles don't have built-in recording options, and a capture device will result in a perfect recording. Some of the more popular capture devices include:Hauppauge HD PVR 2

, The process for this varies depending on the capture device you are using. Typically the software will come on a disc with the capture device. If you don't have the disc, you can download the software from the manufacturer's support site., Most capture devices will connect to your computer via USB. Try to use a USB 3.0 port if you have one for the best performance. Do not plug it into a USB hub, as this will usually slow things down too much., Plug the game console's video and audio cables into the capture device instead of your TV, using the IN ports., Use the OUT ports on the capture device to connect it to the TV. This will pass the signal from your console through the capture box back to the TV, allowing the capture box to record the signal in between., After everything is hooked up properly, start the recording software that came with your capture device. The interface will vary depending on the capture device you are using., Start playing your game on the console. You should see a small version of your TV's display in the recording program on the computer. Once you're at a spot that you want to start recording, click the Record button in the capture program.

Walk around and show off.,
Speak with popular players or other nice looking players.",How to Raise Your Physical Appeal on Spiral Knights,"

Different players have different physical appearances that appeal to their style, thus the unique appearance of every player in Spiral Knights. By using the image as a reference:

A player may choose to look lavish and somewhat intimidating, utilizing their accessories at their disposal to the best of their ability.
Another player may choose to look completely simple, restraining from becoming excessive with their accessories, but still showing off stand-out attributes.
Finally, a player may choose to wear their wealth with rare accessories and show off their skills with color-coordination.;
,

A player should (but they don't have to) keep up with the times and see what other players are wearing. Specifically, a player should analyze which themes (Regal, Prismatic, Dusky etc.) are popular at the moment. This does not need to relate to the current promotion that the game is hosting, such as the Diamond Box Promotion and Slime Box Promotion—but instead it can just be what you tend to see very often while walking around Town Square.,

Wearing much more rarer pieces of ""clothing"" is essential to maximizing your physical appeal, so it's important to look around for rarer pieces of clothing prior to making a costume so you won't have to trash other items and feel some remorse later.

A rare item is usually denoted by its obnoxiously higher price on the Auction House. If it's really nice looking and expensive, chances are it's a rare item.
When an accessory is added to a costume, it cannot be taken off and kept unless you pay a fee. In most cases, players are forced to remove an item to replace it for another. Removals are free, but the item is destroyed. Keep this in mind before you start your purchases early.

,

Using this technique is an extremely smart and useful way to predict how you may look prior to buying. Previewing an accessory, costume, sword, or piece of gear costs nothing and may be the prime determiner of whether you choose to bid or buy it later in the future.

You can also use the preview action when visiting Bechamel in the Bazaar of Haven. Using this can also help with the current unused costumes, accessories and gear pieces in your arsenal.

,

A friend or a merchant or the auction house? This is very important and can make the difference between you getting ripped off by other players and you getting a bargain.

For starters, you should check the auction house to see the current prices on your desired item.
Otherwise, you can ask a merchant for their price on the item. Merchants are useful, but tend to have their own ""exclusive"" prices, which may be lower or higher.
Merchants are useful, but tend to have skills which may make it easier for them to scam you.

,

Similar to step 1, you could take days to find a good price, and generally this is a good thing for both you and your crown wallet. Don't be foolish and purchase too early, and realize the next day there is the same item for half price. Patience is a virtue.

Take notice of the four Hunter Gold Buckled Coats. The first has a drastically higher price than the other three.

,

If you are satisfied with the accessories you have chosen, click the armor or costume piece and the accessory, then proceed to click the ""Accessorize"" button to put them together.,

You can always change your costume, and decide to make changes to it should you see fit.

Remember to look unique! Players are more compelled to talk to you and compliment you if you are different from the others.

,

As simple as it sounds, your physical appeal can determined by a number of factors. Many revolving around players friend requesting you randomly, admiring your look, and complimenting you. This gives you a genuine idea of how high your physical appeal is, and how compelling you seem to be.

A simple ""I like your wings"" can be a nudge to someone saying they like your outfit, and your appeal is good.

,

Not narcissistically though. Do not yell out ""Look at me!"" or ""Hey guys I look so great"". This will not only make you sound narcissistic, but also make you sound very annoying and immature. However, don't be afraid to ask ""Do you like my new look?"" or ""Like my wings?"" in a conversation.

Basically, just be polite.

,

Increasing your physical appeal involves you getting around with the right crowd. You can raise your appeal by speaking with the right players, and they can give you advice on how to change your outfit or do some quirks.

This is an important point, and is remarkably true. You tend to see wealthier-looking players hanging out with other wealthier-looking players, and vice versa.
Finally, you can give advice to other players on how to look good, and in turn you can help other players with their appeal.
Be a social butterfly and raise your appeal!

Recognise the different bars.,
Attack.,
Jump.,
Block the opponent attacks.,
Train.",How to Play Street Fighter Alpha 31," All fighting games have one thing in common: a health bar. At the end of the match, it decides who is the winner and who is the loser. But in Street Fighter Alpha 3, there are other bars on screen.



Health Bar = Red Arrow. Attacking your opponent with various moves lowers their health bar until it is empty.

Guard Gauge = Blue Arrow. To keep your health from reaching zero, you need to have defense. Holding back (away from the opponent) to block stops normal attacks from reducing your health bar and reduces special attacks' damage. However, blocking for too many attacks reduces the gauge and when the gauge empties, the character is 'guard broken,' meaning their guard gauge is smaller than before and they're open for a free attack.

Super Combo Gauge = Green Arrow. The meter bar varies depending on what style the player choose before the match. Different styles offer different advantages. This bar is filled whenever the player attacks, defends, is attacked, and uses special moves.;
, In Street Fighter, there are 6 attack buttons. Low punch (jab), Medium punch (straight), High punch (fierce), Low kick (short), Medium kick (forward), High kick (roundhouse), and 8 directions of movement.

, When moving around in Street Fighter, pressing Up will cause your character to jump. This can be combined with towards the opponent or away from the opponent by pressing Up and Left or Up and Right. These can also be combined with attacks when in the air.

, In order to win in Street Fighter, you need to block opponent attacks. To block, press the directional button that is away from the opponent. For example, if the opponent is on the right side of the screen, press and hold the Left directional button, if the opponent is on the left side, then press and hold the Right directional button.


Also, there are 2 types of blocking: High blocks and Low blocks. High blocks are performed by pressing away from the opponent, but if they are across the screen, then you will back yourself into the corner. To stop that, most of your blocks should be low blocks. Low blocks are performed by pressing away from the opponent and down, a diagonal direction. Blocking low will block most attacks on the ground and keep your position. However, if an opponent is jumping at you, you have to block high or else you will get hit.

, Knowing the basics, go to Training Mode, select a character, and get used to the controls.


Note: Not all characters play the same. For example, most characters have the same jump but Dhalsim has a 'floaty' jump and long limb attacks.

Learn the controls.,
Jump on enemies.,
Get a running start when making a jump.,
Hit blocks.,
Look for shortcuts.,
Run whenever possible.",How to Play Super Mario Bros," On the original NES game, and in most remakes, the controls are A to jump, B or Y to run or shoot a fireball, and the direction pad to move, Start to pause, and Select to switch between Mario and Luigi in the overworld (if the 2 player mode is used). To butt bounce, press A, then, while in the air, press the down button. To jump on walls, press A, then, while on the wall, press the left or right button to jump walls. To carry an item, like a turtle shell or trampoline, press Y and release to let go.;
, Often, this is the only way to defeat them. Koopas (the turtle-like creatures) and Buzzy Beetles will turn into a shell when jumped on. Hitting the shell will send it gliding. You will get extra points if it hits other enemies. Goombas can be defeated when stepped on, but you'll have to butt bounce if you have mini Mario. You can shoot fire at most enemies as well (and get a coin as a reward). However, shooting fire at Dry Bones has no effect. Step on Dry Bones to stun him for a short while.

, Sometimes, it is impossible to jump onto something without getting a fast start on your jump. Before jumping, run up to the object with B or Y on the Direction Pad.

, The levels in Super Mario have loads of blocks. Some blocks have question marks, which either have a coin, a red mushroom, a green 1UP mushroom, or a fire flower. A red mushroom makes you grow into Super Mario, and a fire flower lets you shoot fireballs at enemies, Coins are worth 200 points, and collecting 100 will give you a free 1UP, as will a green mushroom. Make sure to hit regular blocks also. Many contain nothing, but some have items or even several coins in them. Invisible blocks also exist, though they can be difficult to find. Some blocks have a button. Press down on it and a change will be set, such as blocks changing to coins or a tube. Be fast!


Some blocks have a vine to climb. So be careful which direction you choose to hit a block; it may be a vine leading to a secret pipe.

, A test for a pipe that leads to the underground, or underwater levels, is to simply press the down direction on the Direction Pad while on top of a pipe. Going underground will often yield several coins and a shortcut. Another type of shortcut is the warp zone, which can advance you several levels (only for SMB speedrunners)

, Unless absolutely necessary, never stop running. Remember, you have a time limit to finish the level, and the faster you get through the better your score will be.

,,, Watch the video to see V-ism.

, Each character has a set of special moves. A set of input directions and an attack button. You should roll one input into another. For example, Ryu's Hadoken inputs are Down, Down+Forward (diagonal direction), Forward with a Punch button. When executing this motion, you should slide your fingers across the inputs, so as you press Down, you should already be sliding into Down+Forward, then finishing with pressing Forward and Punch at the same time. Refer to these 2 webpages for the move list on all characters: / There are another set of characters that are called Charge characters. Charge characters required to hold a direction for a second then press another direction and an attack buttons. Charge characters are harder to understand and get the timing for, so it is suggested to start off with basic characters, such as Ryu or Ken.
The webpages refer the inputs if the player is on the left side. If the player is on the right side, then the inputs are reversed.

, Alpha counters are attacks made while blocking an attack. To Alpha counter, push forward and the same punch and kick buttons (Low Punch+Kick, Medium P+K, High P+K) when you have the resources to execute it.

, To perform ground and air recoveries depends on what buttons you press and where you were hit, air or ground. To recover on the ground, press 2 kick buttons and/or a direction to roll as soon as you hit the ground. To air recover, press 2 punch buttons and/or a direction to change your direction of recovery.

, Throws are unblockable attacks. To throw your opponents, get close and press either forward or back along with 2 punch buttons (some characters can use 2 kick buttons). To minimize damage while being thrown, press back and 2 punch to land on your feet.

Disrupt the enemy formation with the Controller.",How to Play Rehgar in Heroes of the Storm," Chain Heal is Rehgar’s Q ability, which heals a target ally and heals up to two other allies for around half the original amount; prioritizing heroes over minions or summons. This ability is pretty straightforward, although you need to be quick and accurate enough to heal your ally just when he or she needs it the most. The 9 second cooldown, however, means that you need to pick your targets very carefully. This is why you need to prioritize allies that are being focused down by the enemy to keep them alive.
, Lightning Shield is Rehgar’s W ability, which places a buff on the target that damages nearby enemies and damages nearby enemies over the duration of Lightning Shield. This ability is great when used on melee heroes that can stick close to their target, as it gives them bonus damage that can force enemies to retreat from the continuous damage over time effect. This is especially effective when used on tough heroes that can “stick” to the enemy. (e.g. Arthashastra, Diablo, Chen, Stiches etc.), Earthbind Totem is Rehgar’s E ability, which creates a totem on the target area that slows nearby enemies over its lifespan. This ability makes Rehgar a powerful ally when roaming the map to ambush isolated heroes, especially when partnered with another hero that can disable targets from afar and buy time for Rehgar to drop his totem right on their heads. It is also devastating against enemy teams that clump up together during team fights; making it easier for your team to get in position and destroy enemies caught in the totem’s area of effect. And finally, the totem itself has a respectable sight radius, which you can exploit by dropping the totem along enemy paths of approach to spot them if they try to flank you or your teammates., Bloodlust is Rehgar’s first ultimate, which significantly boosts the attack and movement speeds of nearby allies when activated. Of course, heroes that rely on basic attacks to deal most of their damage (e.g. Illidan, Raynor, Tychus etc.) will benefit the most from Bloodlust, but the attack and movement speed buffs will still be immensely useful for your entire team. The added speed is the true clincher here, as it gives you and your teammates an advantage in positioning; making it easier to chase down fleeing enemies or fall back when taking too much damage., Ancestral Healing is Rehgar’s second ultimate ability, which heals a single target hero for a massive amount of health after a short delay. This ultimate ability can give your ally a second life, which is especially useful for warriors that lead the charge and absorb a large chunk of damage for the team. Just remember that it takes about two seconds for the heal to kick in. The cooldown will trigger as you cast Ancestral Healing – regardless of whether your target is healed or not. This means you need to cast Ancestral Healing when the target has lost enough health to make it count but not before the target dies while being focused down by the enemy., Instead of mounting up like most other heroes, pressing the mount key (default Z) causes Rehgar to instantly transform into a Ghost Wolf. He can maintain Ghost Wolf form even when taking damage, and will only break form when attacking or casting abilities. His first basic attack while in Ghost Wolf form will deal twice his normal damage. This trait gives Rehgar a significant advantage in combat, and is especially useful for letting him get close to enemies or to get away from them even while taking fire., This build focuses on maximizing Chain Heal so that it heals more health, heals more heroes at once and can be used more often. All you need to do is sit back in the rear, cast Chain Heal along with Lightning Shield on heroes that are being focused down by the enemy, and prevent the enemy from penetrating your formation by using Earthbind Totem near your allies. Only pick Cleanse if the enemy team has heroes with lengthy slows, roots or stuns (e.g. Murky, Thrall, Jaina, Malfurion etc.). A well-timed Cleanse can allow your allies to escape what would have been certain doom if they had been disabled all the way. Also, Storm Shield is generally the better pick for dealing with large burst damage, but Farseer’s Blessing is also competent if your enemies are focusing all their damage on a single player on your team.

Talent Build: Spiritwalker’s Grace > Chain Reaction > Earth Shield OR Cleanse > Ancestral Healing > Healing Surge > Tidal Waves > Storm Shield OR Farseer’s Blessing

, This build revolves around Lightning Shield and is best used if your team is lacking in damage due to the absence of hard-hitting assassins or if you already have a healer and your main warrior or melee assassin needs some extra damage to threaten the enemy ranks. Simply cast Lightning Shield on the melee heroes charging the front and follow it up with a timely Bloodlust to further improve their mobility and damage output. You can even join the fray when you get Lightning Bond since it automatically casts Lightning Shield on you as well - complete with all the benefits from the talents you chose.

Talent Build: Empowering Charge > Storm caller > Earth Shield > Bloodlust > Reactive Spark > Lightning Bond OR Earthgrasper Totem > Gladiator’s War Shout

, This build is all about boosting Earthbind Totem while giving you more mobility options to weave into and out of combat. Feral Lunge gives you the ability to close in faster to put down your Totem at a more optimal location, while the stealth from Shadow Wolf gives you the ability to get closer without alerting the enemy and then to disengage more easily once the enemy is hot on your trail. Rewind’s purpose is to allow you to put down two Earthbind Totems – which is a very real threat in large team fights where the enemy team is tightly clumped up and vulnerable to the Totem’s hefty slowing effects. Forward Momentum is the preferred choice since you’ll be joining the battle, but Earth Shield is a respectable choice as well if you have trouble managing the damage the enemy team throws your way.

Talent Build: Colossal Totem > Shadow Wolf > Forward Momentum OR Earth Shield > Bloodlust > Feral Lunge > Earthgrasp Totem > Rewind

Use Cleave to surprise and harass enemies.,
Use Singularity Spike to control enemy heroes.,
Use Blink to get in range or fall back from the fighting.,
Use Shadow Assault to dash in and cut heroes down.,
Use Void Prison to tear apart enemy formations.,
Use Permanent Cloak to get into position.,
Close in for the kill with the Attack Assassin.,
Split enemy attention with the Decoy Assassin.,
Burst enemies down with the Cleave Assassin.,
Break apart enemy formations with the Controller.",How to Play Zeratul in Heroes of the Storm," Cleave is Zeratul’s Q ability, which causes Zeratul to spin and damage nearby enemies. A pretty straightforward skill that is useful against clumped-up minions, isolated heroes and teams that are packed up too tightly. This ability synergizes extremely well with Blink, as you can walk up to a target, hit Cleave and then Blink out to safety.;
, Singularity Spike is Zeratul’s W ability, which releases a spike that sticks to the first enemy hit along its path; slowing and damaging the affected target after a short duration. The Spike takes around half a second to reach its furthest point, so you need to aim the ability just a little bit ahead of your target to land it if it is moving. The real kicker of this ability is its slowing effect, which allows you to effectively chase and isolate targets from a distance.

, Blink is Zeratul’s E ability, which instantly teleports him to the target location. This skill is what gives Zeratul so much flexibility, as it can be used conservatively to keep him alive or aggressively to hunt down and destroy targets from afar. Avoid Blinking blindly into the enemy though, as your innate frailty makes you vulnerable to focused fire should you get ambushed by the enemy team.

, Shadow Assault is Zeratul’s first ultimate ability, which significantly increases his attack speed while causing him to rapidly close the distance between him and his target with each strike.This ultimate is essential if you plan to kill targets with basic attacks, as the charge effect allows him to consistently land those hits even when the target is backpedalling.

, Void Prison is Zeratul’s second ultimate ability, which traps all units in a small area – freezing them in place and making them immune to damage. The fact that this ability lasts five seconds can wreck enemy teams by isolating two to three heroes so your team can focus on the remaining ones. Once the effect ends, you can then turn your attention back to the trapped heroes to finish them off. Even trapping a single hero can often be enough for your team to gain a decisive advantage in tight team fights – although you can also mess up by trapping your allies or turning your enemies invincible just as your allies are about to land the killing blows.

, Permanent Cloak is Zeratul’s trait, a passive ability that turns him invisible once he has been out of combat for three seconds. This means that attacking, being attacked or using abilities will disrupt your cloak and reset its timer. Basic attack and targeted abilities won’t work against you if you’re invisible, but area-of-effect damage or abilities that don’t need a target will still affect you. Other players will also see a slight shimmer if they look carefully, which is why it is better to operate on the assumption that your opponents can see you instead of recklessly diving in with the belief that nobody is aware of your presence., This build is all about maximizing Zeratul’s basic attacks to kill targets in as little time as possible – from increasing basic attack damage to increasing his attack speed. This build, however, will make you easy to kill if the enemy team focuses its fire down on you. This is why your job is to hunt down heroes that like to split off from their team, like specialists that roam the map to try and push lanes or supports that hang back away from the fight. Position yourself in the rear before the fight even begins and jump in to focus the isolated heroes just as the two teams crash together for a massive fight. Try to save Blink for jumping out of the fray when attention shifts to you, but don’t be afraid to Blink in when you see an opportunity to take out one or two fragile in exchange for your own life. Assassin’s Blade is the better pick in most situations, although Giant Killer works well if you are up against multiple enemy warriors with large health pools.


Talent Build: Rapid Displacement > Focused Attack > Follow Through > Shadow Assault > Assassin’s Blade OR Giant Killer > Berserk > Nexus Blades

, This build functions identically to the Attack Assassin except for one difference: you are able to absorb and regenerate a lot of health in exchange for dealing reduced damage. This gives Zeratul increased survivability without sacrificing his ability to neutralize enemies, and is especially effective when the enemy team is not capable of putting out a large amount of burst damage. You will thus be able to better join the thick of battle by taking a few hits, especially since you can still Blink out if you are taking too much heat. Again, Giant Killer should be taken only when up against high-health enemies, while Stoneskin should only be picked if there’s one or two enemy heroes with nasty burst abilities that can kill you right away or disabling abilities that can prevent you from attacking.


Talent Build: Block > Vampiric Strike > First Aid > Shadow Assault > Assassin’s Blade OR Giant Killer > Berserk OR Stoneskin > Nerazim Fury

, This build is all about maximizing the destructive power of Cleave to hurt enemies from the shadows and then Blinking back out to safety. This build is especially effective against low-health heroes that cannot retaliate in time, especially when you get Worm Hole which lets you Blink out after Blinking in to use Cleave. Double it all up with Rewind and you could virtually kill off squishy heroes in the blink of an eye. Do note though that this build will not be as effective if the enemy team has one or two supports that can simply heal the damage you do with Cleave. Still, a coordinate Cleave can help add just enough damage for your teammates to finish off the enemy.


Talent Build: Greater Cleave > Gathering Power > Void Slash > Void Prison > Worm Hole > Rending Cleave > Rewind

, The Controller is all about punishing the enemy team with Void Prison and Singularity Spike. The slowing effects of a talented Singularity Spike will prove devastating in ambushes while preventing enemy teams from moving smoothly across the battlefield. A well-timed Void Prison talented with Protective Prison will make it even easier for your team to isolate and finish off the enemy team at your leisure. Do note, however, that the Controller is not built for straight-up combat. You sacrifice your own damage output for the ability to slow and disable your enemies, so you’ll need your damage-oriented teammates to finish off the enemies you are controlling.


Talent Build: Rapid Displacement > Sustained Anomaly > Shadow Spike > Void Prison > Wormhole > Double Bombs > Protective Prison

Get to Level 10.,

Understand how ranked battles work.,

Get a good battling setup.",How to Play Rainmaker Mode on Splatoon1," Before you can even try Rainmaker, you need to understand that ranked battles require being Level 10 or higher. You can increase this by battling in regular mode. Be sure to paint plenty of the map, excluding walls, and remember that you level up faster when your team wins, but don't get too competitive!
, Ranked battles involve a certain type of battle and ranks. When you win a battle, it goes towards increasing your rank, and the other way around. Ranks go from C- to A+, and the elusive S-, S, and S+ rank., This means a good choice of gear and weapons. First, it comes with choosing a great weapon that's easy for you to use. The most popular weapons happen to be snipers since you can get your enemies from afar, but as long as you can easily ""splat"" your enemies, as well as spread a good amount of ink, your weapon should be good.

You also some great gear. Try getting 3-star gear, as it can hold more abilities at once. Make sure the gear you get comes with abilities to help with your weapons work more efficiently. For example, sloshers use up quite a large amount of ink, so use gear with abilities that give you the power to use less ink with any weapon. It's not just about looking good, but if it looks great and works well, then that can make you more confident in battle!

Go directly towards the rainmaker.,

Obtain the rainmaker.,





Understand the boundaries of using a rainmaker.,
Aid the player with the rainmaker on their journey.,

Make it to the enemy base.",How to Play Rainmaker Mode on Splatoon2," Look at your gamepad, and quickly, yet carefully, decide the best route from your base to the center of the map, where the rainmaker lies. Don't let anything else loose your focus. Only destroy your enemies if they are absolutely in your way, and be quick, or the other team gets the rainmaker., Make sure there are no enemies nearby, and at least one player nearby if possible. You'll notice that there is a glowing ring around the rainmaker which can be destroyed by using your weapon until it bursts. When it does, it spreads a large amount of ink in the area around it, quickly sending all enemies in the area where the rainmaker's ring exploded back to respawn. Then swim straight towards it to collect it, or let another teammate do so if you're feeling generous., A rainmaker may seem cool since everyone is trying to get it, however, there are some drawbacks. First of all, a rainmaker is very heavy, so it is impossible to super jump to the enemy base and just win. Second, it works similar to an inkzooka, how it just blasts ink and knocks you back, but there is always a charge time, where you have to hold ZR and let go after a few seconds if you want the impact to immediately splat someone., Since they have the rainmaker, they are a popular target for the enemy team, considering that when the player with the rainmaker is splatted, the rainmaker is dropped, and the ring around it reforms, ready for someone else to try and grab it. To win, you need to be able to protect the player with the rainmaker, becomes sometimes having a powerful weapon that takes a while to charge isn't exactly convenient., Within enemy turf, lies a pillar where the rainmaker is placed by your team, and vice versa. It is tall, and you can't just jump on it, so you have to ink the side of it, and swim up to the top, and watch as your character places the rainmaker on the pillar, and thereby winning the battle."
"





Think about how the battle went.,
Take a break.",How to Play Rainmaker Mode on Splatoon3," It may sound highly unnecessary but in order to improve in future battles, you should spend time thinking about what you think worked really well in battle, and what you think you could improve on. Try thinking of techniques based off of what other players used, including your enemies, that could help you win next battle. This is a good idea, even if you lost your previous battle., After you've played 20 battles, you should consider letting yourself rest. This way, you can let your fingers, neck, and eyes relax. You can calm down after being so worked up over the battle. You can even help avoid an epileptic episode, due to Splatoon's bright, flashy colors."

Use Storm Bolt to initiate your attack with a stun.,
Use Thunder Clap to keep enemies within striking range.,

Use Avatar right as you get into a major fight.,
Use Haymaker to knock enemies out of position.,
Use Second Wind to stay in the fight after a brief recovery period.,
Shut down attack heroes with the Anti-AA Tank.,
Absorb the hard hits with the Anti-Burst Tank.,
Disrupt enemy formations with the Controller.,
Knock some heads around with the Brawler.,
Blast down enemy waves with the Crowd-Clearer.",How to Play Muradin in Heroes of the Storm," Storm Bolt is Muradin’s Q ability, a ranged skillshot that stuns and damages the first target it hits. This versatile ability gives Muradin a hard-hitting disable that he can use from afar – land the first blow in a duel, catch a fleeing enemy or cancel the channeling abilities of other heroes (e.g. Azmodan’s All Shall Burn, Nazeebo’s Ravenous Spirit, E.T.C.’s Mosh Pit etc.).;
, Thunder Clap is Muradin’s W ability, which deals damage in an area around him and slows all affected targets by 25%. This makes Thunder Clap very good at slowing heroes and prevent them from fleeing. The thing about Thunder Clap though is that it has so much utility depending on the talents you pick. It can shut down melee heroes that depend on auto-attack, it can echo for a second miniature clap, it can be cast more often the more targets are hit, it can heal you for each target hit or it can deal a significant amount of damage if only a single enemy gets caught in it.

, Dwarf Toss is Muradin’s E ability, which makes Muradin to jump to a target location while dealing damage to all affected targets. This skill allows Muradin to close the gap between him and a fleeing hero or to get out of a bad situation if he is caught out of position. It will be up to you to decide when to use it, although try to avoid committing to a blind jump when you can’t see where the other enemy heroes are on your minimap.

, Avatar is Muradin’s first ultimate ability, which grants him bonus health for 20 seconds while causing each basic attack to stun for a brief amount of time. This skill allows Muradin to walk right up to the frontline and take a ton of hits for the team. The ministun helps slow down fleeing heroes while also ruining the day for ones that have channeling abilities, what with each hit stunning and interrupting them.

, Haymaker is Muradin’s second ultimate ability, which knocks a hero back while doing damage in the process. As an added bonus, any enemies hit by the targeted hero are knocked back as well; receiving some damage in the process. If used correctly, this skill can let you reposition enemy heroes to either knock them out of a team fight for a few seconds or to punt them closer to the jaws of your waiting allies.

, Second Wind is Muradin’s trait, which passively restores his health when he has not taken damage in the last four seconds. This restoration accelerates when he is below 40% health – 50% if talented. This gives Muradin the ability to re-enter a fight after hanging back for a short period of time, which works especially when since his abilities can help him disengage from combat at will., AKA the anti-autoattack tank, this build is designed to mitigate the damage from heroes that rely on basic attacks to deal their damage (e.g. Illidan, Zeratul, Raynor, Valla, Sgt. Hammer, The Lost Vikings etc.) If the enemy team has ranged autoattack heroes, pick Block and Avatar. If the enemy has melee autoattack heroes, pick Reverberation instead to punish autoattack heroes that get near you. Skullcracker and Avatar also help you slow down the attack of these auto-attack heroes by stunning them for brief windows of time – further reducing their damage output as you brawl against each other.


Talent Build: Block OR Reverberation > Third Wind > Skullcracker > Avatar > Healing Static > Imposing Presence > Unstoppable Force

, This build is all about negating ability-based damage while making it easier for Muradin to fall back, recover health and rejoin the fight. Block, Avatar, Spell Shield and Hardened Shield will allow you to better withstand bursts of damage directed at you. Landing Momentum and Dwarf Launch serve two purposes: to help you escape after absorbing damage, and then to come back and better re-engage once you’ve healed up enough. This build is thus ideal against enemy teams that rely on hard-hitting ability damage (e.g. Jaina, Kael’thas, Kerrigan, Nova, Falstad, Zeratul etc.)


Talent Build: Block > Third Wind > Landing Momentum > Avatar > Spell Shield > Dwarf Launch > Hardened Shield

, This build is all about bringing and keeping your opponents where you want them to be – either to prevent them from hurting your teammates or to bring them closer so that your teammates can chew them up. Infused Hammer lets you toss out Storm Bolt so that you can save more mana for Thunder Clap and Dwarf Toss. Those two skills in turn will be heavily talented to let you better position yourself, isolate enemies with all the slows, and then knock them away from their teammates with Hay Maker. Pick Grand Slam if you think you can jump safely into the enemy team’s formation to knock two squishy heroes to your teammates. Pick Rewind for a safer approach, since you can jump into their formation, unleash the rest of your skills, hit Rewind and let loose another Storm Bolt and Thunder Clap before jumping back out of their formation with a refreshed Dwarf Toss. All this makes the Controller very tricky to use – but also very rewarding if you manage to play it right.


Talent Build: Infused Hammer > Thunder Burn > Landing Momentum > Hay Maker > Thunder Strike > Dwarf Launch > Grand Slam OR Rewind

, This build is as simple as the Controller is complex. Walk in, hit people until they die and jump out when you take too much damage. Block/Reverberation gives added survivability against ranged and melee basic attacks. Thunder Burn, Skullcracker and Avatar all stand to gain from the 75% damage bonus of Give ‘em the Axe. Burning Rage adds even more damage simply by walking around. Rewind gives you the ability to further throw down disabling abilities and open up a path of escape with a refreshed Dwarf Toss. You won’t be as tough with this route, but this build will punish enemy teams who tend to ignore the warriors to focus down assassins or supports.


Talent Build: Block OR Reverberation > Thunder Burn > Skullcracker > Avatar > Burning Rage > Give ‘em the Axe! > Rewind

, This utility build specializes in dealing with large crowds of minions. It shines when your enemy is pushing too aggressively and is able to mass up a large number of minions and summoned creatures to batter down your gates.(e.g. specialists like Zagara, Azmodan, Sylvanas, Gazlowe, Abathur etc.) You can also regain a surprisingly large chunk of health with Healing Static and Crowd Control due to all the enemy units on the screen - not to mention the cooldown reduction from Battle Momentum and the ability refresh of Rewind.


Talent Build: Reverberation > Crowd Control > Battle Momentum > Avatar > Healing Static > Heavy Impact > Rewind

Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald – Ralts can be captured on Route 102 connecting Oldale Town and Petalburg City. Ralts is rare, so you may have to spend some time finding one.
Pokémon Diamond and Pearl – Ralts can be captured on Routes 203 and 204. You have to use your Poké Radar to encounter it. You also have a very small chance of finding a Kirlia, which will save you some time.

Pokémon Black and White – Ralts can be found in the White Forest in Pokémon White, but cannot be found by Pokémon Black players. Pokémon Black players will need to trade with another game to obtain Ralts.

Make your movements difficult to follow once you are the lead dancer.,
Have and use mostly moves that correspond the the type of contest you enter.,
Try to be the one who fills up a judge's voltage bar.,
Use moves to your advantage.,
Don't try guessing which judge the other contestants will choose.",How to Win Pokémon Contests in Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum," The five possible categories are tough, cute, cool, beauty, and smart. Certain Pokémon and moves are more suited to a category than others; the only other differing factors between the categories are the prizes won and the opponents you go up against.;
, It would be more advantageous if their favorite food corresponds with the type of contest you entered. If picking the right Pokémon isn't already vexing enough, then you'll be ever so happy to hear that the Pokémon's nature will also factor into their favorite flavor of Poffins.


Best suited berry flavors and natures:

Cute: sweet berries/Poffins; sweet berries will be their favorite food if their nature is timid, hasty, jolly, or naive
Cool: spicy berries/Poffins and a lonely, brave, adamant, or naughty nature
Beauty: dry berries/Poffins and a modest, mild, quiet, or rash nature
Smart: bitter berries/Poffins and a calm, gentle, sassy, or careful nature
Tough: sour berries/Poffins and a bold, relaxed, impish, or lax nature
Neutral natures: hardy, docile, serious, bashful, and quirky. Therefore, Pokémon with any of these five natures will eat anything.



, The higher the level, the more moves your Pokémon can learn.


If you have a couple heart scales on hand, go to the moves tutor in Pastoria City. To find him, go to the top of the Pokemart, then up until you see a house, then directly right. You can teach your Pokémon a move for one heart scale.

, Rarer berries make better Poffins and can also be traded in for accessories.


There's a woman whose house is left of the moves tutor's house in Pastoria, the berry master who can be found through the left exit of Hearthome, and a girl inside of the Floroma flower shop who all give out free berries each day.

, Feeding your Pokémon Poffins will increase their condition, and in turn, their score in the Visual portion of the contest. Check the tag on the berry before making it into a Poffin, though. Poffin flavors correspond with your Pokémon's favorite food and will increase their condition in usually only one respect. For instance, if you give a Pecha berry (which is sweet, so it increases cuteness) to a Marill whose favorite food is sweet and has a jolly nature, and you plan to enter them in a Cute contest, then it would be the best match.


The Poffin house is in Hearthome.
In Pokémon Platinum, you can buy Poffins, berries, and other contest items in the Veilstone Department Store's basement.

, Talk to lots of people, everywhere you go! Trade berries in for accessories in the Floroma flower shop, get a massage in Veilstone, or take a walk in Amity Square with a cute Pokémon.


Easy, useful accessories to get:

Three masks: 2nd floor of Jubilife TV, 1st floor of Veilstone Department Store, and Pastoria City
Flag: Route 206
Big tree: Eterna Forest
Crown or tiara: Pal Park, with FireRed or LeafGreen in GB slot



, The house is located in the north-east; the boy will give you a scarf based on your first slot Pokémon's highest condition. Have your contest Pokémon hold the scarf.


Cute: pink scarf
Cool: red
Beauty: blue
Smart: green
Tough: yellow

, There is a practice room in the contest hall that you can use beforehand. It's just a run-through of the actual contest, without anything being official.

, Some items work better for some themes more than others. Use your best judgement. If you have a theme called ""The Natural"", then it'd be best to use items such as rocks and leaves, not fake facial hair.

, You have 60 seconds to dress-up your Pokémon; don't let it go to waste.

, Try tapping your foot along to the music and correctly hit the castanets when it's time for the backup dancers to follow along.

, Use all four castanets and leave erratic gaps between your steps. Some people recommend ending with the blue castanets, but there's no actual proof that this always works.

, If you use a cool move in a smart contest, then you'll get a lower score for that round and the judge's voltage will lower.

, Once it's full, then whoever gave that judge the last voltage will get five points added on to their score. Be careful about it- if the judge you're going for needs only one more voltage and you're last in line, then chances are that you won't be the one to get it.


Dexter, the head judge, awards eight points instead of five once his voltage bar is full.

, If you usually score low in the Acting portion, then you will probably be first in order most of the time (Pokémon are ordered based off of their score from the previous round; lowest scorers are up front and highest scorers are at the bottom). If this is the case, then have a move that gives you a bonus for being first in order.

, It's random. Just don't even try.

, It would also be wise to have a Pokémon who knows the move False Swipe. No matter how strong your Pokémon is, the move False Swipe will always leave the target with at least 1 hp.

, Dusk Balls are very effective at night, or in dark places such as caves.

, Wild Pokémon may surprise you by having high-damage dealing attacks.

, Beware of moves that burn or poison, as they will drain the Deino's life, possibly before you can capture it.

, Deino doesn't evolve into Zweilous until level 50.

Complete the Sinnoh Pokedex.,
Go into a grassy field.,
Walk over to the shaking grass.,
Recharge the radar if needed.,
Defeat the Pokémon you meet.,
Persist, persist, persist!,
Head for sparkling grass.",How to Use the Poke Radar," You don't have to catch them all, just see them all. Once you've done this, go talk to Professor Oak in front of Pal Park and he'll give you the Poke Radar.;
, The Radar only works in short grass, so you'll have to find some. Use a repel, which will make it so you only encounter the Pokémon found in the shaking grass (granted your first party Pokémon is a higher level than the wild Pokémon in the area). Also, make sure you're not on your bike. Once you have the spot you want, use the radar.

, You'll need to keep track of which patches were shaking. Aim for grass farther away, for more chance at finding the same Pokémon again. Be careful not to go to grass right on the edge however, as this heightens the chance that the radar will not find any more shaking spots. If this happens, just recharge the radar.

, This can be helpful if the shaking grass patches are all different to the ones you've seen previous, you're searching for a shiny patch or the radar finds no shaking grass patches (""The grassy patch remained silent...""). Do this by walking 50 steps, being careful not to run into a shaking patch or let your repel run out.

, If you defeat the Pokémon you meet, the grass around you will keep rustling. This saves time, meaning you don't have to bother recharging the radar.

, Often, you'll meet dirt common Pokémon repeatedly. Don't fret. The Pokémon you can only catch with the Poke Radar are fairly rare. If you meet it once, there's a high likelihood you'll meet the Pokémon more regularly.

, If the grass is sparkling, there is probably an ultra rare shiny Pokémon there, so don't miss that opportunity.

Stock up with healing items and of course balls for catching the Legendary Pokémon.


You will receive a Master Ball after defeating the Elite Four that you can use, but you might want to save that for more difficult Pokémon such as Landorus,or Kyurem.
Zekrom can only be caught in Pokémon White. If you are playing Pokémon Black, you will need to trade for Zekrom.;
, Before proceeding to the main castle where Zekrom is, you have to defeat the Elite Four first. They will have different types of Pokémon so make sure you have a well-rounded team to beat each member.


After beating the Elite Four, activate the glowing statue to descend into the mountain. After a scene, you will be taken to N's castle.

, When you capture Zekrom, you can immediately add it to your party if you have five Pokémon in your group instead of six. You can find a PC to do this on the third floor. In the second floor of the castle, you can heal your Pokémon team.


You can leave the castle if you need to get some more supplies or level your Pokémon up some more. Go to the third room from the right on the third floor of the castle. Talk to the Plasma Grunt and you can be teleported away. When you're ready to return, talk to the Grunt at the Pokémon Center at the Pokémon League.

, You'll find N at the top of the tower. After a cutscene, Zekrom will be summoned. You'll have a chance to save your game, and then talking to Zekrom will start the battle. Make sure to save in case you mess up the battle and need to retry.

, Use your strongest Pokémon to lower Zekrom's health. One strategy is to use Pokémon with the Dig or Dive ability to elude Zekrom's strong attacks such as Fusion Bolt. Keep in mind that Zekrom is at level 50 when you battle against it.Zekrom is weak to Ice, Ground, and Dragon attacks.
Since you want to capture Zekrom, you would want to keep his HP low and then go for the capture! If you get it's health ball into the red, start throwing Ultra Balls at it. Keep chipping away at the health and tossing balls until you catch it.
If you fail to capture Zekrom here, you have another chance to do so at the 7th floor of Dragonspiral Tower, which can be found to the north of Icirrus City.This is where Zekrom can be found in Black 2 once you receive the Dark Stone from N.

Assess whether or not you're ready.,
Capture Cobalion.,
Travel to the top floor, pushing boulders using Strength when needed.,
Wear him down and try to capture him.,
Head off to Victory Road to catch Terrakion.,
Walk straight ahead until you reach a funny looking cave, different from others, such as Mistralton or Chargestone Cave.,
Capture Virizion.,
Find the area called Rumination Field, and Virizion will be standing in the clearing.,
Use the right technique.",How to Catch the Musketeer Trio in Pokémon Black or White," To stand a chance of catching these Pokémon, you will need :


Pokémon of lv.50 or higher, with at least one knowing False Swipe. False Swipe can be obtained from Professor Juniper, as long as you have seen at least 30 Pokemon.
Several Revives, Potions and Ultra Balls, all of which can be obtained from any Pokémon Center
50-100 Dusk and Timer Balls for each Legendary. Both can be obtained from Opelucid Cities Poke-mart.
The HM's Strength and Fly.;
, Before you can catch Terrakion or Virizion, you'll need to capture Cobalion. To catch him, on Route 7, near Chargestone Cave, surf to Mistralton Cave.

, When at the top, an old man will explain the legend behind Cobalion. Walk on, and you will see Cobalion. Walk up to him and speak to him to battle him.

, If you catch him, great! If you defeat him, great! If he defeats you, it doesn't matter, you'll see him again soon. Now the other two will appear.

, It would be easier to Fly to the Pokémon League, then head into the cave at the top. Take a left once inside.

, Go in, and you will find Terrakion. Fight him.

, Even if you made Terrakion and Cobalion faint, you can capture Virizion. To do this, go to Pinwheel Forest.

, Well done! You've seen them!

, When trying to catch them, whittle down their health with any type, just not four time effective moves as they will usually kill before you can get the health bar down to yellow. Once the health is in yellow, use false swipe to get down to one health. Once their health is at one, use forty Dusk Balls, as they have max effectiveness, until turn 41ish, when Timer Balls gain a better chance.

Deposit one or two Pokémon into the Day Care center that you want to level up.,
Travel to the Battle Train Station, and find a path that won't be obstructed if you keep walking in the circle.

,
Press A over the dark spots.,

Catch Cobalion.,
Prepare well.,
Go through Victory Road and reach the Pokémon League.,
Attempt to catch him.,
Throw a Dusk Ball once he is down to 1 HP and has a status change.",How to Catch Terrakion in Pokémon Black and White," Terrakion will not appear until Cobalion is caught. Cobalion can be found on the third level of Mistralton Cave, where he will be waiting for you in the northwest corner. To find Mistralton Cave, Surf north on the river to the left of the Scientist's house on Route 6, bypass the rocks in the way, and Surf east on the river where you will see a cave entrance.
, Terrakion is as difficult to catch as any other Legendary, with the lowest capture rate possible. If you have all you need, catching him will be easier. Bring strong Pokémon and plenty of healing items for your Pokémon.

Have a Pokémon with False Swipe of at least Level 30. Axews can be found in Mistralton Cave knowing this move at Level 24 or higher. Professor Juniper will give you the TM once you have seen at least 30 Pokémon.
Have a Pokémon who knows Strength.
Own a Pokémon who can inflict paralysis, sleep, or freeze. Yawn, though it takes longer, is a more accurate way to make a Pokémon fall asleep than Hypnosis, so keep this in mind.
Get, at a minimum, one Quick Ball, a few Timer Balls, 25 Dusk Balls, and 20 Ultra Balls. The more Poke Balls, the better.

, From the Pokémon League, backtrack to the gate where there is a cave entrance to the east. Go through here, go west down the stairs, south, and then west again along the narrow passage. You will see a different sort of cave entrance on the northern wall. Go through it and you will see Terrakion sitting in a small room, waiting for you. Save the game and then talk to him., Throw a Quick Ball at him on the first turn. It might catch him, it might not, but it's always worth a try, though only on the first turn.

Avoid super-effective moves. Be careful - you don't want him to faint. If he does, you can always turn off the device and retry again, but be on the safer side!
When you use False Swipe depends on how powerful your Pokémon who learned it is, but don't loose your chance - try in the yellow, and then red. When you see a tiny little sliver of HP, this is probably the lowest you can go.
Putting him to sleep or freezing him will give you a higher rate of capture than paralysis, remember. Do one of those.

, Keep throwing them; they are your best shot. If you can get a Heavy Ball, use it, as Terrakion is heavy! After about 40 turns, bring out your Timer Balls. If you feel the battle is going poorly or if you need more Poke Balls, you can always turn off the power and try again, but hopefully, you will have caught him!"

Prepare for the battle.,
Get your own Master Ball.,
Defeat the Elite Four.,
Enter N's Castle.,
Create your Reshiram-catching party.,
Find Reshiram.,
Battle with Reshiram.",How to Catch Reshiram," You will be taken to your first chance to capture Reshiram directly after defeating the Elite Four. Reshiram is an extremely dangerous Legendary Pokémon. When you fight it, it will be Level 50. That being said, you should have a good Pokémon team that can go head-to-head with Reshiram. Stock up with healing items and at least 30-50 Ultra Balls.;
,


You will receive a Master Ball after defeating the Elite Four that you can use, but you might want to save that for more difficult Pokémon such as Volcarona or Kyurem.
Reshiram can only be caught in Pokémon Black. If you are playing Pokémon White, you will need to trade for Reshiram.

, You will need to beat the Elite Four in order to gain access to N's Castle where you can fight Reshiram. The Elite Four will each have different types of Pokémon, so make sure you have a well-rounded team to beat each member.


You will be able to change your party after fighting the Elite Four, so don't worry if you don't have the right group for catching Reshiram.

, After beating the Elite Four, activate the glowing statue to descend into the mountain. After a scene, you will be taken to N's castle. You will be treated to a few scenes, and then you will need to track down N in the castle and confront him.

, When you capture Reshiram, you can immediately add it to your party if you have five Pokémon in your group instead of six. This will make the rest of the castle much easier. You can find a PC to do this on the third floor of the castle. In the second floor of the castle, you can heal your Pokémon team.


To make catching Reshiram as easy as possible, make sure your party has a Pokémon that knows False Swipe and a Pokémon that knows a move that causes sleep or paralysis. You may need four to six Timer Balls.
You can leave the castle if you need to get some more supplies or level your Pokémon up some more. Go to the third room from the right on the third floor of the castle. Talk to the Plasma Grunt and you can be teleported away. When you're ready to return, talk to the Grunt at the Pokémon Center at the Pokémon League.

, You'll find N at the top of the tower. After a cutscene, Reshiram will be summoned. You'll have a chance to save your game, and then talking to Reshiram will start the battle. Make sure to save in case you mess up the battle and need to retry.

, Use a heavy-hitting Pokémon to take some chunks out of Reshiram's health. Once it starts to get low, use False Swipe to take the health down to 1 HP without knocking Reshiram out. Use a move that causes sleep or paralysis, as this will make Reshiram much easier to catch.Reshiram is weak to Ground-, Rock-, and Dragon-type attacks.
Once Reshiram is asleep or paralyzed and at 1 HP, start throwing Ultra Balls at it. If it wakes up or becomes able to move again, use the move again.
Keep throwing balls! You may not catch it on the first ball, but you will catch it eventually.
If you fail to capture Reshiram here, you have another chance in doing so at the 7th floor of Dragonspiral Tower, which can be found to the north of Icirrus City.This is also where Reshiram can be found in White 2 once you receive the Light Stone from N.

Analyze the weaknesses of your opponents.,
Pick a Flying or Fire type to fight Aaron.,
Pick a Grass type to fight Bertha.,
Pick a Water or Ground type to fight Flint.,
Pick a Dark, Fighting, or Ghost type against Lucian.,
Round out your lineup to take on Cynthia.,
Use Hidden Machines (HMs) and Technical Machines(TMs) to teach your Pokémon powerful abilities.,
Assemble your team.",How to Select the Best Pokémon to Beat the Elite Four in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl," Each member of the Elite Four specializes in a certain Pokémon type. Aaron prioritizes Bug type, Bertha prefers Ground type, Flint likes Fire type, and Lucian excels in Psychic type.


Since you cannot change lineups between fights with the Elite Four, you will need to bring a powerful, but diverse lineup.;
, Unfortunately, no single Pokémon fits both so you’ll have to pick one. If you started the game with Chimchar, his evolved form will take you through the bulk of the fight. Here is a list of Aaron’s Pokémon and their potential weaknesses:


Dustox: Bug/Poison. Weak to Flying, Ground, Rock, Fire, or Psychic
Heracross: Bug/Fight. Weak to Flying , Fire, Psychic
Vespiquen: Bug/Flying. Weak to Flying, Rock , Fire, Electric, Ice
Beautifly: Bug/Flying. Weak to Flying, Rock , Fire, Electric, Ice
Drapion: Dark/Poison. Weak to Ground

, All of her Pokémon share a weakness to it. Torterra is especially good if you started the game with a turtwig. Here is a list of Bertha’s Pokémon and their weaknesses:


Quagsire: Ground/Water. Weak to Grass Hippowdon: Ground. Weak to Grass, Water, Ice
Sudowoodo: Rock. Weak to Fighting, Ground, Steel, Grass, Water
Whiscash: Ground/Water. Weak to Grass Golem: Rock/Ground. Weak to Fighting, Ground, Steel, Grass , Water , Ice

, A Gastrodon is perfect here. If you started the game with Piplup, the evolved form will get you through most of this fight as well. Here is a list of Flint’s Pokémon with weaknesses:


Rapidash: Fire. Weak to Ground, Rock, Water
Infernape: Fire/Fight. Weak to Flying, Ground, Water, Psychic
Steelix: Steel/Ground. Weak to Fighting, Ground, Fire, Water
Lopunny: Normal. Weak to Fighting
Drifblim: Ghost/Flying. Weak to Rock, Ghost, Electric, Ice, Dark

, Fighting has good defense against Psychic, but may lose usefulness beyond this fight. Strong dark attacks can work through this fight very quickly. A Spiritomb will do very well, but there are many options.


Mr. Mime: Psychic. Weak to Bug, Dark, Ghost
Girafarig: Normal/Psychic. Weak to Bug, Dark
Medicham: Psychic/Fight. Weak to Flying, Ghost
Alakazam: Psychic. Weak to Bug, Dark, Ghost
Bronzong: Steel/Psychic. Weak to Fire, Ground Note: Bronzong will have the ability Levitate (causes user to be unaffected by ground types)

, Cynthia is the Pokémon Champion that immediately follows the Elite Four. A Togekiss is a good choice to beat her Spiritomb. Otherwise fill in the gaps from your choices for the Elite Four to create a well rounded team.


Spiritomb: Ghost/Dark. No weaknesses. Just don't use any normal moves.
Garchomp: Dragon/Ground. Weak to Ice , Dragon
Gastrodon: Water/Ground. Weak to Grass Milotic: Water. Weak to Grass, Electric
Roserade: Grass/Poison. Weak to Flying, Fire, Psychic, Ice
Lucario: Steel/Fight. Weak to Fighting, Ground, Fire

, Moves like Surf, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Flamethrower, and Earthquake can be super effective against the Elite Four's Pokémon when used in the correct situation. They can also give your Pokémon more diverse attack type options. Moves that cause status effects (Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Sleep Powder) as well as moves that raise your Attack and/or Speed (Swords Dance and Dragon Dance) can also be very helpful.

, Unique Pokémon like Palkia or Dialga will always be a strong choice, but if you don’t have access to them or don’t want to use them for a challenge, there are many options for a well rounded team. Sensible switching to exploit differences in the fight will be key. Good luck!

Often, hacked Pokémon are created at Lv.,
Another way to tell the Pokémon is a hack is whether or not it is shiny.,
Another way is that a hack Pokémon's catch date is sometimes ""Jan 0, 2000"".

,
A hacked Pokémon's stats can also give you a hint as to if a Pokémon was hacked.",How to Spot a Hack Pokemon in Diamond or Pearl," 100. If it is a hack, then the Pokémon's description may say, ""Apparently had a fateful encounter at Lv. 100."" It may also have a location where Pokémon cannot normally be captured, such as in the Pokémon League. The highest leveled wild Pokémon in either game is the wild Arceus, which is at level 80. The event for this Arceus has yet to occur.;
, Most hacks are shiny, but please note that it may not be. Shiny legendaries are easier to obtain without hacking, however, because players can save right before encountering the legendary and use a method known as 'soft resetting' for a shiny. Therefore, do not always assume that a shiny legendary is hacked either.

,, High stats are fine, but if a Pokémon has a speed of 500, it is obviously a hack. Also look at a Pokémon's ability. Often, hackers will make their Pokémon's ability something like Wonder Guard, which prevents damage unless the move is super effective (and is exclusive to the Pokémon, Shedinja).

,
Battle competitively with this Garchomp and you may win many more matches than you previously did.",How to Raise a Perfect Garchomp,";
, Jolly might be the best, because then Salamence, Pikachu, and Celebi will not be faster than your Garchomp, and you can outrun faster Pokémon such as Gengar. You can either keep on catching Gible until you get one or you can breed until you get one. Giving the Gible parent an Everstone to hold will probably increase the chances of getting a good nature. These natures are the ones that you'll want because they don't lower any of Garchomp's perfect stats.

, You can use Protein and Carbos for the first 100 EVs in each stat if you have enough money.

, If you do not mind extra training, then breed for a Gible egg. Its stats (could) be higher and it can learn powerful egg moves like Thrash. Placing it in the day-care will require a lot of walking, but allows higher EV training.

,, If it is not in the daycare, train it in Attack and Speed. Fighting Pokémon with normally high Attack or Speed stats will raise Gabite/Garchomp's total ability.

,, At level 49, the Gabite can learn Dragon Rush, a highly powerful but slightly inaccurate move. Evolving it at level 48 will give a marginal amount of extra Attack. Evolving it at level 49 lets you learn Dragon Rush earlier. It's your choice.

, When you have Garchomp, the following moves are highly recommended:


Earthquake
Stone Edge or Rock Slide
Dragon Claw, Dragon Rush, Dual Chop, or Outrage. Dragonbreath and Dragon Pulse are optional, as is Draco Meteor, but it wastes the use of Garchomp's Special Attack stat (but this can be easily changed by switching your Garchomp out).
Fire Fang/Crunch
Dragon Dance
Substitute
Protect

,, If you use Garchomp on the same team as a Tyranitar, Garchomp will get a 20% chance to avoid getting hit. Just remember to have other Pokémon that can take in Water, Grass, Ice, Fighting, and Fairy attacks. Another good idea if you want to do this is to give it a Yache Berry to hold. This will let your Garchomp survive most Ice type attacks.

Get some good starters.,
Have a balanced team.,
You may also want an Electric or a Grass-type to counter water Pokémon.,
If you want to use a flying type who can be use to fly and can be good in battle.,
As for your 6 Pokémon; you can use any Pokémon.,
Choose your starter wisely.,
Have an HM Slave.,
Know the types of Pokémon the Elite Four uses.,
Train your Pokémon to be at least lvl.",How to Make a Good Team on Pokemon Diamond and Pearl," Starter Pokémon can be a big help in the game. Turtwig turns into a Grass and Ground-type, Torterra who is good at its attack and defense but not the best with speed. Chimchar the Fire-type evolves into a Fire and Fighting-type, Infernape who has great attack and special attack like many Fighting-type Pokémon have and also good speed. Piplup evolves into a Water and Steel-type which is a very unique type, Empoleon. Empoleon is good with special defense and attack.;
, If you didn't pick Empoleon, a Water-type is needed. Good Water-types are Floatzel, Gyarados, Gastrodon and Palkia if you're planning to use legendary Pokémon. If you didn't pick Infernape you can get the Fire-types Rapidash and Magmortar since there isn't many Fire-types in the game.

, Good electric Pokémon are Luxray, Raichu and Electivire. A good Grass-type would be Roserade who is part position type.

, Staraptor is a great Flying-type who can learn close combat which can cover for it's weakness to Rock-types and is great with attack and speed. Another Flying-type is Honchkrow which you can get in diamond. Drifblim is a great Pokémon with high health and also a part ghost type but it's defense isn't the best which isn't a good match with it's high health since high defense and high health will be good.

, You may consider picking a Pokémon that's super effective to your team's weakness. Garchomp is also a great Pokémon and so are Lucario and Blissey.

,


Turtwig evolves into Torterra, which is good at attack and defense but horrible at its special attack. However, it can learn Dark-type moves like Bite and Crunch, which could save one of your Pokémon slots as you do not need a Dark-type.
Chimchar evolves into Infernape which is a decent Pokémon.
Piplup evolves into Empoleon which is a Steel and Water-type. A good mixture of types as being a Water-type, Fire-type moves would not be super effective even though it is a Steel-type.

, Do not use an HM and ruin a Pokémon with a good moveset. Instead get another Pokémon that is pretty much useless to be an ""HM slave"". It is recommended that you choose Bidoof, which evolves into Bibarel, as it can learn most of the HM except Fly and Rock Climb.

, It doesn't matter if your Pokémon has a type disadvantage against gym leaders. What's more important is to have a type advantage over the Elite Four!

, 65-70 so you can get pass the Elite Four much easier."

Choose your starter wisely.,
Understand the effectiveness or some types against others.,
Know the informal classes of each Pokémon.,
Understand how a Pokémon's stats affect its effectiveness.,
Level up your team to at least level 50.",How to Make a Balanced Team in Pokémon Platinum1," The first Pokémon you get in the game will, in many ways, determine how the rest of your team develops. You have three options to begin, the water-based Piplup, the fire-based Chimchar, and the grass-based Turtwig.



Piplup grows into a water/steel hybrid Pokémon, and can learn ice moves as well. Because it is both water and steel, he has very few weaknesses and can learn a variety of useful moves, making his evolved form very powerful. Often seen as the best possible starter.Turtwig is slow, but has great attack and defense and functions well against almost every gym leader in the game. He is a good pick for entry-level players.Chimchar becomes a fire-fighting hybrid, which makes him useful in a lot of scenarios and useful in almost every gym. Platinum has less fire Pokémon than other games, so Chimchar is a good choice if you want to save the hassle of looking for other fire Pokémon.;
, The main concern when building a team is making sure you are not weak to any one type of Pokémon. That is because the game is built on a complex ""rock-paper-scissors"" system where one type of Pokémon will get an advantage over another based on type. For example, Fire attacks are effective against Grass Pokémon, and their moves do twice as much damage. The inverse is also true, as a Grass attack will only do half its normal damage to a fire Pokémon. Attacks of the same type will only do half damage as well in most scenarios (Flying attacks against flying types do not have any extra effectiveness.) A complete table of effectiveness can be found on the Pokémon Database.


A status move will have the same effect no matter what type it is used on.
Most effectiveness is based on logic -- Flying beats Bug (because birds eat bugs), Water beats Fire, Steel beats Rock, etc.
A Fire-type Pokémon who uses a Normal-type move, like Tackle, will not be effective against Grass-type Pokémon. It will do normal damage as Normal-type moves aren't super effective against Grass types in most scenarios. However, if a Pokémon has an ability like 'Pixilate' which turns certain typed moves to another type, this may be the case.
Some moves will do no damage whatsoever to the right type. For example, a Ground attack will never hurt a Flying Pokémon., Longtime players have developed a lingo around certain Pokémon that makes it easier to think about building teams. These terms don't refer to a type of Pokémon, like Fire or Ghost, but rather the function of the Pokémon.



Sweeper: The most common Pokémon in your team, sweepers are powerful offensive Pokémon used for dealing damage and taking out the enemy. You will likely have 3-4 in your team of 6, and some players want 5-6.

Try Alakazam, a Legendary Pokémon, Metagross, Luxray, Scizor.



Wall These Pokémon have high HP (health points) and defense. They can survive a lot of damage while you use items to heal up the rest of your team, making them invaluable for staying in the fight. Sometimes called ""Tanks.""

Try Shuckle, Steelix, Bastiodon, Torterra, Rhyhorn, Aggron or Blissey.



Support: These Pokémon use a variety of stat-boosting (for themselves) or stat-depleting (for your enemy) moves to weaken the opposing team. For stat boosts, they need to know the move ""Baton Pass,"" which gives the next Pokémon you sub in the same stat boosts that you just used.Try Raichu, Sandslash or Umbreon



HM 'Slave': Generally not used for fighting, HM Slaves are sometimes used for travel, as they can learn a variety of moves like Surf, Fly, Strength, etc. that are essential for moving the game along. They are usually subbed in and out when needed, not used for battles.

Try Linoone, Charizard or Bibarel.



Catcher: This Pokémon, usually not used in battles, is used to catch new Pokémon in the wild. They usually have a mixture of powerful moves, some neutral, weak moves, and sometimes Sleep or Paralyze to make a Pokémon easier to catch. They almost always know the move False Swipe.

Try a Scyther, Farfetch'd, Raticate or Gallade., Different attacks do different damage based on your stats, and knowing how the stats work will help you craft an effective team. For example, if you have a Sweeper who uses mostly Special Attacks, like Luxray, you want to make sure it has a high Special Attack. If you are fighting a trainer with lots of Physical Attacks, like a rock gym, sub in a Pokémon with a high defense stat, like Shuckle.



Attack: Affects the power of a physical attack such as Scratch or Tackle.

Special Attack: Refers to mental or indirect attacks, like beam attack or environmental attacks. All non-physical attacking moves utilize the Special Attack stat.

Defense: Determines the amount of damage taken by a physical attack.

Special Defense: Determines the amount of damage taken by special attacks.

Speed: Determines who attacks first. Speed stats are compared between the two fighting Pokémon and the fastest Pokémon attacks first. In a tie, it is chosen randomly., You will need a team with all the Pokémon around this level in order to compete against the best trainers in the game, specifically the final bosses, the Elite 4. Leveling up increases your stats, teaches your Pokémon new moves, and gives you the chance to evolve your Pokémon into stronger forms.

"
"
Pick your starter.,
Decide what your line up should be.,
Learn about your party.,
Practice different move sets on all the Pokémon.",How to Make a Great Pokemon Team on Pokemon Diamond," Your starter Pokémon should know how to Fly, and another that knows how to Surf. These are the best HM's for a moveset. You will also need more Pokémon to create a ""party"".;
, For example: if a Gym Leader trains Bug-types, sent out a Flying, Fire, or Rock type out.

, Your party should be strong at all times unless you're training weak Pokémon or hatching eggs.


Note that there are weaknesses to other Pokémon that you might not have. Try teaching your Pokémon moves that are not their type. They might not be as strong, but at least you can counter other trainers' attacks!

, Also, it might not be best to have all legendaries. Use good Pokémon that you like.

"
"
Aim for balance in your team, not just the strongest Pokémon.,
Grab an Electric type Pokémon.,
Make sure you snag a water type: Water Pokémon can use Ice moves and only have two weaknesses, Electric and Grass.,
Have a Psychic/Dark type Pokémon.,
Get a Ground, Rock or Fighting-type Pokémon.,
Consider a Grass-type if you didn't start with one.,
Find a Fire-type Pokémon.,
Fill out any holes with good overall Pokémon that compensate for your weaknesses.,
Know that having solid move sets, which are a Pokémon's four moves, are as important as choosing balanced Pokémon.",How to Make a Balanced Team in Pokémon Platinum2," Having three Electrics and three Fire type Pokémon, no matter how strong, is going to mean trouble when you run into a Ground Pokémon. You want a wide variety of types so that you don't have any of the same types of Pokémon in your arsenal. This is the biggest key to a balanced team, and this will get you through just about every single battle.


Think about the roles your Pokémon play. While you want mostly ""Sweepers"" (strong, attacking Pokémon), you should get at least one ""Wall,"" like Snorlax or Blissey, (lots of HP and defense) to help you heal everyone in a time of need.

, Probably one of the most important types, electric Pokémon are weak against only Ground, but are resisted by Grass and Dragon type Pokémon. They can learn a large variety of moves. You can catch a Shinx early in the game, and it's evolved form, Luxray, can be an indispensable member of your team.


Try Electivire or Raichu if you don't want a Luxray.
If you can catch the Legendary Bird Zapdos then you will be well armed for the challenges ahead.Use moves like Thunderbolt, Thunder, and Thunder Fang.

, However, since Ice moves are effective against both Grass and Dragon types and work normally against Electric Pokémon, Water Pokémon are incredibly useful, and HM Surf is actually powerful. If you didn't start with Piplup, you can try:


Floatzel, Gyarados, or Vaporeon.
Utilize moves like Surf, Waterfall, Hydro Pump.

, These rare but powerful Pokémon are invaluable to your arsenal, especially a Pokémon that can learn both types of moves. You will be good against other Psychics, Bugs, Poison, and other Dark Pokémon. More importantly, these Pokémon usually have a high Sp. Attack and a lot of special moves.


Metagross, Alakazam, Espeon, Gallade and Hypno are all Psychic or Dark types.
Get moves like Psychic, Night Slash, Bite and Psycho Cut.

, Many of these Pokémon share types and can learn moves from each set, making them viable against a variety of Pokémon. They also cross frequently with other types, making the even more versatile. Fighting types are usually quite frail, while Rock and Ground types are usually quite bulky.


Mamoswine, Bastiodon, Golem, Infernape and Lucario are examples of Fighting types.
Use Earthquake, Rockslide, Rock Smash, and Close Combat when possible.

, Grass Pokémon, though weak to a lot of types, have a wide and powerful moveset that makes them great in certain situations. Roserade is generally the most common, as it can learn Psychic and Poison moves and has a high Special Attack.Tropius, Torterra, Carnivine and Venusaur are all grass-type Pokémon.Use moves like Giga Drain, Energy Ball, and Leaf Blade.

, Since there are unfortunately not many Fire-types in Platinum, snag a Ponyta early in the game that you can level up to the quick, powerful Rapidash. If you chose Chimchar to start, he will be able to get you out of just about every mess needing Fire Pokémon, including almost every gym. You will also be super effective against Grass, Ice, Bug, Rock and Steel types.


Legendary Bird Moltres is a great choice as well if you can get your hands on one.
You can get an Eevee in Hearthome City in the house above the Pokémon Center. This Pokémon can evolve into a Fire, Water, Electric, Psychic, Dark, Grass, or Ice type if you have the requirements completed.
Learn moves like Flare Blitz, Fire Blast, and Sunny Day.Fire Pokémon are not strictly necessary -- a good Fighting Pokémon can often compensate for a missing Fire type., There is an online generator that lets you plug your team in to see it's stats. It will tell you where you are weakest and offer suggestions to fill the hole. Some good Pokémon to consider are:


Flying Pokémon, like the powerful and popular Staraptor (must know Fly and Close Combat).Any Legendary Pokémon. These are the Pokémon that only appear once in each game, like Mewtwo or Latios. They are incredibly powerful and will be a valuable asset on any team.

Try Giratina. It is a Ghost and Dragon type of Pokemon, so you get the advantages of Dark type moves and Dragon type ones that have a wide variety of effectiveness and low weaknesses.
Find Heatran, a strong Fire and Steel type Pokémon that works well if you need some heat.



, While having the right types of Pokémon is essential to survive against any type of Pokémon you face, you won't be able to succeed offensively without the right move set. Just like you need to balance your Pokémon types, you need to balance the types of moves you have to fight well against anyone.


You want to balance offensive and defensive moves in every Pokémon.
STAB moves give you a 50% attack bonus if the type of move (ie. a Fire Move, like Ember) matches the Pokémon's type (ie. Infernape, a Fire Pokémon, using Ember). When possible, teach Pokémon moves that match their type."

Exercise proper caution.,
Ask people you know personally.,
Check out online stores or auction sites.,
Check out a store or garage sale.",How to Get Pokémon Diamond," As Pokémon Diamond isn't officially in production any longer, you'll need to make sure to be cautious when searching for a copy. While it's not a dangerous job, you'll need to be on high alert for people trying to scam you or extort money out of you. You may naturally know what's a warning sign, but there are many things to look out for, such as price, playability, and if it's actually the right game.

Pokémon Diamond is only in the form of a Nintendo DS cartridge (which is basically a plain black, square-shaped cartridge). If you find one that's offered as something such as a Game Boy Advance cartridge or a 3DS cartridge, it's fake.
Ask to test the game before buying it; some games may be corrupted to the point of unplayability, whether it's due to a physically damaged cartridge or a failed run with an Action Replay. If this isn't possible (e.g. you're buying online), ask the seller if they know for sure that the game is in working condition, and get proof of this statement in case they give you a broken copy.
Don't pay too much for the game. The average cost of a used copy of Pokémon Diamond in US dollars is currently around 30 dollars or less. You should not be paying over a hundred dollars for a game, even if it's still brand-new.;
, If you have any friends or family who you know have old games (whether or not you know they're Pokémon), try asking them if they have an old copy of Pokémon Diamond that they don't want anymore. Be prepared to pay them money for it; some people are willing to sell their games at a price. However, if you have a good friend who's not too attached to their Pokémon Diamond game, you may be able to get the game for minimal costs, or for free.

Don't pressure. If you know someone with Pokémon Diamond, don't force them to give it to you. If they reject the notion of giving you the game, whether or not money is involved, drop the subject and move on.

, Sites like Amazon or eBay are fairly reliable; somebody may be selling their old copy of Diamond that they don't want anymore. You may want to search for listings that are normal sales, as auction prices can get very high, and you don't want to pay too much for a simple game that didn't have any ""limited edition"" types.

Make sure to read things thoroughly. Some people will just sell the game's box and note this somewhere you aren't likely to read, and when you complain, will point out that it's written on the item description. You don't want to get scammed because you didn't read the whole thing; most sites will be unwilling to refund your money because you didn't read the item description.
If you pay money for a game that's said to be in good condition, and then you don't receive the game or get a damaged game that's unplayable, contact the site's support. Many reputable websites will be willing to refund you if you were victim to a scam.

, You don't have to limit yourself to an online shopping search. Game stores such as GameStop or other stores may host old copies of Pokémon Diamond that you can buy. Thrift stores may also sell old games for considerably cheaper than a game store, and garage or yard sales can be a great place to find Pokémon Diamond for cheap prices. The game shouldn't be too expensive at a normal game store, but if you're tight on money, consider thrift stores or garage sales instead.

Some game stores are dedicated specifically to games for older consoles that are no longer in production. While these kinds of stores would be more likely to host things for consoles such as an N64, you may find DS games here, including Pokémon Diamond.

Access Features.",How to Play Like a Pro in NBA 2K14," It may seem simple enough to know how to move around the court but there are some things that you need to learn and unlearn in order to get used to NBA 2k14’s basic mechanics.


Majority of the main controls are untouched. The analog stick for consoles still controls your player’s movements and the same goes to the pass button and such.
One of the biggest game changer though is that the right analog stick now controls both dribbling and shooting for your player. This is quite hard to get used to at first since it all depends on how much pressure you put on the analog stick.
For consoles, the L2 button (left trigger) now manages how you pass the ball, some sort of a pass modifier. Remember, you can configure your controller setup to your preference. This applies to both consoles and PC format.;
, Before you decide on completing a season or career, it is advisable for you to practice your basketball skills first just to make sure you are on top of your game when you go head to head with tough AI opponents.


The 2 player mode is one of the most effective mode to practice your basketball prowess. Simply start a quick game and you are off to the old exhibition mode between you and a friend. An AI team opponent team can also be arranged.
You might want to work on your outside shooting mostly since NBA 2K14 made it harder now for players to hit those nasty three pointers. Also, the AI of the opposing team's players are now tweaked to make it harder for you to drive and simply shoot the ball into the basket.

, Since winning a ball game on NBA 2k14 is not as easy compared to its previous versions, keep in mind that you will have to strategize and play wisely to beat the opposing team.


Distribute the ball evenly among your players. Do not keep the ball in the hands of your superstar because eventually, opposing players will flock over your scorer and you won’t have any choice but to pass the ball. Make sure you have other threats aside from your star player.
Outside shooting is a must! More than inside scoring, long shots will be your best friend if you want to win in ball games. AI Defense has been raised in NBA 2k14 and scoring inside the paint will not be a walk in the park no more.
Different teams have different strengths and weaknesses - so bear that in mind. Something that works for Spurs might not work against Lakers. Just be sure to study how teams play and more so, learn from them.
Master player rotation to deepen your bench. Your superstars will eventually feel fatigue and will definitely require rest. This is the time that your sideliners should step up. Remember, you should not depend your team’s success on one or two players only because sometimes accidents happen and they might get fouled out or worse - get injured.

, There are a few game types available in NBA 2K14 that you can play which offer different kinds of game modes to your liking. Some requires constant play through that actually simulates an actual whole NBA season.


Association mode is back and puts you in the shoe of a team’s general manager. You may not be battling it out on court but you are battling a different kind of challenge behind the sidelines. You will handle trades and other important aspects of handling a team such as choosing the best player for drafting.
MyCareer has always been a favorite among NBA 2k players. Why not? It is actually a game mode that allows you to create a player from a rookie to a superstar! This is the closest thing you’ll have to actually experiencing an actual NBA season as a bona fide NBA player.
A new addition to this game is the mode Lebron: Path to Greatness. Not all NBA 2K14 fans like this addition but it will surely appeal to those who adore Lebron James. This mode simply puts you in the role of Mr. James himself as he build his career towards championship dynasty. You can say it is somewhat like MyCareer mode but this time it is focused on you being Lebron himself.
Another mode that made a comeback is the Crew mode. This mode offers a more casual approach in playing NBA 2K14 for this allows half court action with 3 on 3 or 5 on 5 basketball matches. This mode is more fun with friends playing as your team mates.

, It is quite impressive that NBA 2K14 acknowledges not only NBA teams but also teams outside the NBA realm. Sure enough, even if these Euroleague teams lack superstars, they can surely teach you a thing or two about the barebones of basketball skills. Mind you, some players from the Euroleague actually reaches the rank of 100 on offense!

, This new feature allows you to conduct plays for your team in a very effective manner. Plays like pick and roll will be executed with ease with the use of this feature. Opposing teams also uses this feature so you should pay attention and learn from the plays they call.

, Features in NBA 2K14 is vast and very rich in content. Everything in this section has something to do with stuff you can unlock or buy. Stuff like unlocking retro teams to shoes or even customizing color can be tweaked in this section.


This adds replayability to the game since there’s a lot of unlockables that can be shared via 2Kshare to complete your collection.

Harass and reveal enemies with Moonfire.,
Zone enemy heroes with Entangling Roots.,
Rejuvenate your entire team with Tranquility.,
Neutralize ability-reliant heroes with Twilight Dream.,
Replenish mana-reliant heroes with Innervate.,
Keep your team alive with the Pure Healer.,
Keep the battle going with the Refresher.,
Harass the enemy with the Burner.,
Disrupt enemy formations with the Controller.",How to Play Malfurion in Heroes of the Storm," Regrowth is Malfurion’s Q ability, which instantly heals your target while simultaneously applying a secondary heal over time. This skill does wonders for keeping the health of your teammates up in the long run as it’s the secondary heal over time that recovers the most damage. Your teammates could literally walk out of a big fight bruised and battered only to re-engage the enemy team with most of their health restored.;
, Moonfire is Malfurion’s W ability, which does minor damage to enemies within a small radius while simultaneously revealing them for the next two seconds. Moonfire may not deal a lot of damage straight-up, but its low cooldown and low mana cost make it a very real threat against heroes that cannot recover their health fast enough. If you have a keen eye for spotting the slight shimmer of invisible heroes, you can use Moonfire to reveal your targets and make it easier for your teammates to focus them down.

, Entangling Roots is Malfurion’s E ability, which creates a large circle on the ground. A patch of grass will appear in the center of the circle and will radiate out towards its edges over three seconds – damaging and rooting all enemies caught within the affected area. This skill is devastating when cast on areas you don’t want your opponents going. Cast it behind them if you want to prevent them from fleeing, or cast it in front of them if you don’t want them chasing. Enemies will then be forced to either stay rooted for 1.5 seconds or stay away from the circle – hopefully zoning them so that they’ll end up where you want them to be.

, Tranquility is Malfurion’s first ultimate ability, which gradually heals all nearby allies in a large radius for the duration of the ability. This ability is what allows Malfurion’s teammates to survive large engagements, especially when coupled with Regrowth. The heal over time is relatively slow though, meaning that Tranquility won’t save a hero who’s out of position and is being focused down by the enemy team. Still, this ultimate ability serves as a beacon that can restore just enough health for your team be more aggressive since they’ll have much more survivability during and after the initial clash.

, Twilight Dream is Malfurion’s second ultimate ability, which after a short delay damages enemies in a large radius and prevents them from using abilities for the next three seconds. If Tranquility’s weakness is heroes that can burst down you or your teammates with abilities, then Twilight Dream squarely patches over that weakness by silencing all affected heroes. Casting Twilight Dream just as your team clashes with the enemy team will shut down their abilities; giving your teammates a short window of opportunity to penetrate the enemy lines and land their own hard-hitting abilities before the enemy has a chance to react.

, Innervate is Malfurion’s trait, an active ability that will restore 15% of the target’s maximum mana over a short period of time. This skill is obviously worthless against heroes that don’t use mana (e.g. Murky, Illidan, Sonya, Abathur, The Lost Vikings and Chen) but it is an absolute godsend for heroes that do use mana (everyone other hero) Couple Innervate with Regrowth, and Malfurion becomes the perfect hero for sustaining his allies on the battlefield., This build is all about maximizing your ability to keep your allies as healthy as possible. Using it is relatively simple: spam Regrowth on the targets that need it the most, then spam it some more to keep everyone’s health maxed out. Serenity is typically the better choice at level 20, but Storm Shield is an equally useful talent if your teammates are fragile and the enemy team is filled with high-damage heroes. Just remember to stay in the rear and avoid getting into combat, especially when you want to keep your health up so that Hardened Focus will take effect.


Talent Build: Scouting Drone > Rampant Growth > Enduring Growth > Tranquility > Life Seed > Hardened Focus > Serenity OR Storm Shield

, The Refresher combines Malfurion’s innate ability to heal allies with a more diverse set of skills. You sacrifice some healing potential to keep your allies’ mana reserves up with talents boosting Innervate. Calling down a MULE will also help your structures survive longer against enemy heroes that tend to push a lot, while Cleanse can save your teammates from devastating disables that would otherwise have isolated them and made them easy kills. Again, choosing Storm Shield over Serenity is ideal only when up against an enemy team capable of putting out a lot of damage in a short span of time.


Talent Build: Shan’do’s Clarity > Versatile > Calldown: MULE OR Cleanse > Tranquility > Life Seed > Hardened Focus > Serenity OR Storm Shield

, If your team is lacking in the damage department, you can help add in a few hard hits with the Burner - a build that focuses on improving your damage output through Moonfire-related talents. Stand back in the rear, unload Moonfire after Moonfire, watch the enemy team’s health steadily tick down and punish any aggressive maneuvers with Strangling Vines and Twilight Dream. This build is also effective at defending against heavy minion and mercenary pushes since Moonburn doubles Moonfire’s damage against the aforementioned units.


Talent Build: Moonburn > Elune’s Grace > Strangling Vines > Twilight Dream > Full Moonfire > Lunar Shower > Nightmare

, The Controller is all about forcing the enemy team apart with slows and roots. The added range from Elune’s Grace makes it easier for you to land Moonburn and position Entangling Root, while Shrink Ray is reserved against heroes that deal most of their damage using basic attacks or against heroes that stray too far from their teammates and are ripe for the kill. Coupling Tenacious Roots with Rewind is great for punishing enemies that clump up too tightly by hitting them with Entangling Roots, while Hindering Moonfire with Nightmare gives you even more options to isolate solitary targets with consecutive slows.


Talent Build: Scouting Drone > Elune’s Grace > Strangling Vines > Twilight Dream > Shrink Ray > Tenacious Roots OR Hindering Moonfire > Rewind OR Nightmare

Beat people’s faces in with the Brawler.",How to Play Johanna in Heroes of the Storm," Punish is Johanna’s Q ability, wherein she swings her mace to slow and damage all units within a short range. This skill takes advantage of Johanna’s durability to engage and then hold enemies in position either to facilitate your escape or to make it easier for teammates to position themselves and rain damage down upon the target. Punish can be talented to return mana on each swing, to hit slightly harder and/or to slow affected targets down even further.;
, Condemn is Johanna’s W ability, and it is one of those skills that make her so effective at disrupting enemy formations. After a short delay, it will damage, pull and stun all targets caught within its radius—extremely useful for clumping up the enemy teams so that your allies can rain down area-of-effect abilities on them. You can invest many talents into Condemn to help deal with large numbers of enemy minions, cast it more often, make you move faster while it charges up and deal additional damage to targets caught within its radius.

, Shield Glare is her E ability, which causes enemies within a long, narrow cone to take damage and miss all their basic attacks for a brief period of time. This is especially useful for neutralizing enemy heroes that rely on auto-attacks to deal damage, like Illidan, Raynor, or Tychus. You can talent Shield Glare so that affected enemies will take damage when hit and/or you heal yourself for each enemy affected by Shield Glare.

, Falling Sword is Johanna’s first ultimate ability, and it sends her flying up into the air towards an area to deal damage and briefly stun enemies near the landing zone. This is especially useful for penetrating the enemy formation to target their softer support and assassin heroes as well as escaping bad situations where you are caught out of position.

, Blessed Shield is Johanna’s second ultimate ability, which is a skill shot that involves tossing out a shield in a straight line to damage and stun a target before bouncing to additional targets for slightly less damage with a short stun duration. The skill’s relatively short cooldown and potential for disabling enemies from afar makes it especially useful when you practice landing those shots, although it can be a bit tricky to use when there are a lot of enemy targets blocking the way.

, Iron Skin is Johanna’s trait, wherein activating it with the D key will give her a hefty shield while simultaneously making her Unstoppable. This is what makes Johanna such a hard tank, because it not only adds to her innate toughness but also makes her immune to stuns, slows, roots, and other nasty effects for as long as Iron Skin is up. You can pick talents that let you cast Iron Shield more often, make it absorb even more damage and/or make you move a lot faster when you take damage.

, There are four different ways you can build up Johanna. The first is the Hard Tank, which is all about building Johanna in such a way that she cuts a significant portion of the damage thrown at her. This is most effective against enemy compositions that depend on abilities that rain down burst damage against their targets (e.g., Jaina, Kael’thas, Kerrigan) while being somewhat useful against other forms of sustained damage. You will, however, deal little to no damage on your own—meaning that enemies can ignore you for longer periods of time and focus on your teammates instead. This build will also work best when you have a competent healer to keep your health up during the course of the fight. The key to using this build is to charge in, check the enemy advance to protect your team, and buy enough time for your team to position themselves to kill the enemy team.



Talent Build: Reinforce > Amplified Healing > The Crusade Marches On > Falling Sword > Hold Your Ground OR Spell Shield > Imposing Presence OR Holy Renewal > Indestructible

, The Sustain Tank is similar to the Hard Tank in terms of play style, but with one crucial difference: you trade your short-term toughness for long-term survivability. This build is all about being able to take a series of hits and then healing the damage you just took. This build will work a lot better against heroes that rely on basic attacks to deal their damage (e.g., Illidan, Raynor, Valla, Tychus, etc.) and being able to recover a significant portion of your health on your own.



Talent Build: Regeneration Master OR Reinforce > Laws of Hope > Battle Momentum > Falling Sword > Hold Your Ground > Holy Renewal OR Imposing Presence > Indestructible OR Storm Shield

, The Controller is all about trading some measure of survivability for being able to keep enemies within arm’s reach. This makes it a lot easier for your teammates to get into position and finish off those who you’ve trapped with your control abilities. It also gives you the ability to make it harder for the enemy team to get past you to target your softer, squishier allies while also making it easier for you to catch up to fleeing enemies and prevent them from getting away. This build is particularly effective for ganking enemies and for blocking hotly-contested chokepoints. You will, however, not be able to take as much damage as the dedicated tank builds, so you need to be careful not to overextend yourself.



Talent Build: Knight Takes Pawn > Eternal Retaliation > Conviction > Blessed Shield OR Falling Sword > Subdue > Fanaticism > Radiating Faith OR Heaven’s Fury

, Lastly, the Brawler is all about giving Johanna enough sustained damage to punish enemy teams who ignore you in team fights. Sure, Johanna isn’t Illidan or Raynor when it comes to damage output, but choosing the Brawler build lets you do a surprising amount of damage for a warrior. This gives the added benefit of forcing enemies to retreat from the fight and heal up because of the damage you’re putting out. You won’t be able to take as many blows or chase down enemies as often as you like, but you’ll still be tough enough to exchange blows on the front line. This works particularly well when you have another warrior on the team or don’t have enough assassins to quickly take down enemy targets.



Talent Build: Righteous Smash > Roar > Battle Momentum > Falling Sword > Burning Rage > Blessed Hammer > Heaven’s Fury

Try the crocodile cap prank.",How to Beat the End in Metal Gear Solid 3," Let him shoot you once; then check your body to see where the dart came from. If the dart is stuck on your left side, with a right-ish angle, then he shot you from the right of where you stand. If he shot you on the left side, but the dart angle is left-ish, then he is hiding somewhere on your left. Once you find the pattern, it will become very easy to end this boss battle. Act immediately. Once you're out of the menu, spot him and shoot him. Don't give him the time to hide again.


Also remember, these examples are using a first person perspective of snake; when you use the heal menu, from your point of view, the right-ish angle will be left-ish, like when you see yourself in the mirror.;
, It's fun, but it can easily blow your cover. If he detects you, you may as well as run before he catches you.

, This one vibrates your joystick only when a human is near you and also makes a sound continuously. The more the human is near to you, the faster the sound becomes.

, There are sniping points marked in a white circle. When the end shoots you with a tranquilizer dart, check out the map, one of the white circles will turn red, that's where he is. shoot him with a SVD sniper rifle or anything.

, Did you know the end also keeps an eye on your footprints? Well, He does. He tracks all the way where you are and freezes you from behind. If frozen from behind, you won't be able to move.

, If you find a colourful parrot somewhere it's his and it means a sign of him nearby. From this point you have a number of choices, either kill the parrot or capture it alive by shooting the EZ gun or MK22 at it. Eat the parrot if you want (which is utterly pointless). It is horrible. Covers a barely noticeable amount of stamina. If you captured it alive, and cannot find the end, throw the parrot somewhere. Then use the Directional microphone, you will hear the end scolding loudly to his parrot. Sneak up to him or attack him once you've pin pointed his location.

, Whenever you notice a bit of whiteness, check it up using the binoculars. There's a chance you'll find him!.

, You will find it in the swamp after you meet Eva the first time. Keep swimming around until you find logs blocking your way, go under it by diving using the X button.

Catch fleeing enemies and be an all-around nuisance with the Chaser.,
Negate enemy disables with the Counter-Controller.",How to Play Kharazim in Heroes of the Storm," Radiant Dash is Kharazim’s Q ability, which you can use to instantly teleport to an ally or an enemy. If used against an enemy, you will immediately smack that enemy with a basic attack. This is very useful for engaging into or disengaging out of combat. Radiant Dash can also be talented extensively to increase its utility, from holding more charges and doing more damage to revealing cloaked enemies and increasing your movement speed. You even pick a level 20 talent that can instantly add two charges to Radiant Dash.
, Breath of Heaven is Kharazim’s W ability. Pressing it will instantly heal you and nearby allies while giving everyone affected a 10% boost to movement speed for three seconds. Both the heal and movement speed bonus give it a surprising amount of utility no matter what build you choose to stick with, although Breath of Heaven can be talented to heal more or to protect yourself and your teammates from slows, roots, blinds and silences., Deadly Reach is Kharazim’s E ability, which is a self-targeting buff that doubles your attack speed and attack range for two seconds. This synergizes well with Kharazim’s traits and can help him deal a surprisingly large amount of damage over time – as long as your target is within striking range. It can be talented to boost your movement speed, last longer and be cast more frequently., Seven-Sided Strik is Kharazim’s first ultimate, which causes him to become invincible, sit still in one position and create a large glowing circle around him for a short time. He will strike the hero with the highest percentage of health for 7% of its maximum health within that circle, and he will do so up to 7 times – 11 times if you pick the appropriate talent at level 20. This skill is absolutely devastating if you manage to catch a hero alone – especially warriors with their large health pools – but its effectiveness starts to go down the more heroes there are within the radius as the strikes will be spread out among the enemy team., Divine Palm is Kharazim’s second ultimate. Casting it upon a hero (yourself included) will protect that hero from death for 3 seconds – reviving and applying a large heal if that hero should die while under its effect. This skill is pretty hard to time, but mastering it will give your team a massive advantage in team fights, from giving the tank a second lease on life to rescuing a hero that was caught out of position. Getting Peaceful Repose at level 20 will be useful if your timing is off, but it can also help when playing against smart enemies that hold off on killing your target while under the effect of Divine Palm., Kharazim is able to pick one of three possible traits at level 1. Each will drastically change Kharazim’s capabilities in a fight and will play a large role in how you use him.

Transcendence gives Kharazim the ability to heal a nearby hero with every 3rd basic attack; prioritizing the one with the lowest percentage of health. This makes Kharazim a useful tool for keeping the entire team’s health topped up – assuming he is able to keep landing those blows.
Iron Fists doubles the damage of every 3rd basic attack. It’s a straightforward damage buff, and synergizes well with the right talent build to allow Kharazim to quickly bring down the health of all targets that cannot get away fast enough from him.
Insight restores a small amount of mana with every 3rd basic attack. This allows Kharazim to keep throwing out his abilities without worrying too much about his mana reserves. This will synergize well with utility builds that rely on frequently casting abilities to aid allies while frustrating enemy attempts to disable your team. The benefits of Transcendence and Iron Fists, however, often far outweigh the benefits of Insight in Kharazim’s current form.

, Kharazim is an extremely versatile hero and is able to fill drastically different roles depending on which talent build you work with. Picking the right build and knowing what to do with these builds will be key to utilizing him properly, from hanging back to support your allies to rushing forward to take advantage of an opening in the fight. This is especially important to remember when you consider the fact that Kharazim is a melee hero with a low health pool., This build maximizes the healing potential of Breath of Heaven while restoring your allies’ health as you attack whatever you can in range to trigger Transcendence as often as possible. Using Breath of Heaven will force you to stay dangerously close to the front line, but Radiant Dash talented with Quicksilver will help you get out of a bad spot when you start taking too much damage. If you notice that the enemy team is focusing you down with burst damage though, then you may want to swap out Quicksilver for Spell Shield instead. Storm Shield is the preferred pick at level 20, but Peaceful repose works if you have trouble timing your Divine Palms or are up against a smart enemy team.

Talent Build: Transcendence > Healing Ward > Echo of Heaven > Divine Palm > Quicksilver OR Spell Shield > Circle of Life > Storm Shield OR Peaceful Repose.

, This off-tank build allows Kharazim to deal damage while keeping him and his teammates topped up as he batters down the enemy with his fists. The point of this build is to talent Blazing Fists so that you are able to attack as often as possible while still preserving his ability to keep himself and his allies alive. This build is particularly effective at sieging enemy forts and capturing mercenary camps. These situations let you attack as freely as you wish; restoring health to the hero that needs it the most while you do so. It loses a lot of its effectiveness, however, if the enemy team has high burst damage that can take you out in the blink of an eye if they catch you out of position. Again, pick Peaceful Repose over Storm Shield only when you are having trouble with Divine Palm or are up against a team that knows how to hold off on the kill.

Talent Build: Transcendence > Overtake > Echo of Heaven > Divine Palm > Fists of Fury > Blazing Fists > Storm Shield OR Peaceful Repose.

, This build is all about doing as much damage as possible with your basic attacks. It’s a straightforward build, where all you need to do is find something to punch and then pummel it to oblivion. In practice, however, you will find that you will need the aid of an ally or two to hold your enemies in place. Talenting Deadly Reach will allow you to stay close to your target, but you will only be able to maximize your damage potential if your target is significantly slowed down or held in place with a well-timed stun. This build will also make you a lot easier to kill, so it is only recommended if you have another support to keep you alive or if you have heroes with lots of disables on your team.

Talent Build: Iron Fists > Overtake > Way of the Hundred Fists > Seven Sided Strike > Fists of Fury > Blazing Fists > Transgression.

, This utility build revolves around the idea of zipping around the battlefield and disrupting the enemy team’s attention while catching up and then punishing enemies that flee. At high levels, you will be able to significantly boost the movement speed of your allies thanks to Quicksilver and your multiple charges of Radiant Dash. You can also better chase down fleeing enemies so that you can annihilate them with a well-timed Seven-Sided Strike once they’re alone. You can then finish them off using talented Radiant Dashes. In exchange, you won’t do a lot of sustained damage and you won’t heal as much as you could. Getting Foresight and Clairvoyance also gives you the ability to neutralize the stealth capabilities of heroes like Nova or Zeratul while giving your teammates the speed they need to pin them down once they’re revealed. The added vision from these talents also gives your team an edge when fighting around corridors or visibility-blocking elements like tall grass or steam vents.

Talent Build: Transcendance OR Iron Fists > Overtake OR Foresight > Way of the Hundred Fists OR Clairvoyance > Seven-Sided Strike > Quicksilver > Blinding Speed > Epiphany.

, This is a utility build that focuses not just on healing allies but on countering enemy teams that rely too heavily on disables. Enemy teams filled with heroes that have long-lasting disables (e.g. Jaina, The Butcher, Leoric, Malfurion, Gazlowe, Murky, Nova, Thrall etc.) can make it virtually impossible for a hero to react – much less escape - once focused down with all these disables. Use Cleanse and Soothing Breeze to release allies from their status effects while protecting them with heals, shields, Quicksilver, Divine Palm and Storm Shield. This will ensure that your team will be able to weather the initial barrage to come out and finish up the enemy team once they’ve run out of disables. Timing is everything though, as you need to be far enough away not to be caught up in the disables and then jump in at the right moment to negate the control abilities tossed at your allies.

Talent Build: Transcendence > Protective Shield > Cleanse > Divine Palm > Quicksilver > Soothing Breeze > Storm Shield.

Download the Pokémon GO app and create an account.,
Find out if your business is or is located near a PokéStop or a Gym.,
Buy a Lure in the PokéShop.,
Use the Lure near your business and wait for trainers to arrive.,
Advertise phone charging stations.",How to Use Pokémon GO to Generate Sales for Your Business1," There's another way to do this that doesn't require you to have a Pokémon account discussed below, but the most effective approach to this method involves you having the app.;
, These are two amenities in the game that players will naturally be inclined to head towards. Once you have the app, check the game's map from your business and see if it is located near a PokéStop (a blue icon with a floating cube) or a Gym (a tall, ringed structure with a light beam piercing through its center).

, A Lure is an in-app purchase that increases the number of Pokémon that appear near a PokéStop for 30 minutes when used there. They come cheap and, as of yet, have offered most businesses a great return on investment (ROI).If you find that your business is located near a PokéStop, using a Lure near it will incentivize increases in the amount of foot traffic by way of Pokémon trainers . You can buy Lures in varying quantities, and their prices are as follows:


1 Lure Module - 100 PokéCoins ($0.99)
8 Lure Modules - 680 PokéCoins ($6.73)

, For 30 minutes, Pokémon trainers in the area will be more greatly attracted to your business to catch Pokémon. This phenomenon in and of itself may be enough to successfully stimulate business interactions, but in order to increase sales even more, read on.


If you don't want to buy and use lures yourself, consider marketing a discount or reward offer to trainers who use a lure at your business.

, Pokémon GO is notoriously power-consuming for phones. Once you have attracted Pokémon trainers to your business, you can strengthen your value proposition by offering free charging stations to customers.


If demand for charging stations becomes particularly high, consider investing in power strips for multiple trainers to plug into.

Host a Pokémon tournament.,
Host a PokéHunt.,
Use Pokémon for branding.",How to Use Pokémon GO to Generate Sales for Your Business2," If your business is located near a Gym, consider marketing a Pokémon GO tournament. All you have to do is advertise a date and time during which Pokémon trainers are invited to come and battle each other at your business. Although many players will be happy to have a reason to take part in a tournament under any conditions, you can incentivize more people to come by offering a reward - cash prizes and free product are both fair game - to the winner.

, If your business is located near neither a gym nor a PokéStop, you can still generate Pokémon-based buzz around it by hosting a Pokémon hunt that begins and/or ends at your business. Invite trainers to congregate at your business and map out a local route for trainers to travel through together in search of Pokémon. Have the hunt end back at your business (this is particularly effective for restaurants). As always, you can incentivize competitiveness and participation by offering a reward to the trainer(s) who catch the rarest Pokémon.

, Offer customers a deal for posting screenshots of Pokémon found at your business to social media, tagging your business in the process. Particularly in the case of rare Pokémon, this will often cause other trainers to come to your business to seek out the Pokémon spotted at your business. This can be effective for general use as well as a way to ride on the reception of a Pokéhunt or a lure party."

, Open the map on your Pokémon GO app (the main screen). Look for the largest structures on the map: the tall columns surrounded by rings and pierced by a vertical beam of light. These are gyms, where Pokémon trainers congregate to pit their Pokémon against one another.


If you can't see any gyms in your immediate vicinity, pinch your screen with two fingers to see a zoomed out view of the map.
If you still don't see any gyms in the area, try heading to your nearest town center. Gyms are generally placed in central locations, so if you live somewhat off the beaten path you may need to travel a ways to find one.

, Unless the gym appears on your map as white, which is quite rare, it will be controlled by either the Blue, Yellow or Red team, and display as this corresponding color.


If you do happen to find a White gym, you can claim it as your own and defend it against challengers (discussed below).

There is no inherent difference between each team
This will only happen during your first visit to a gym.
You cannot change teams once you have chosen one to join., The next screen you see will display the Pokémon you are up against.

Tap the icon at the bottom-right corner of your screen.
Tap on the Pokémon you would like to challenge your enemy with.

, button to commence the battle. Make sure you're ready before you commit to battling!

, Pokémon are all categorized by certain ""types"", and perform differently when pitted against certain other types. Find out how choose Pokémon with the best advantage against the Pokémon you're against using this chart. The arrows point to the types of Pokémon with the greatest advantage.

, The Pokémon you encounter at gyms will often be stronger than individual Pokémon in your pack. In order to prevent your team from getting knocked out, send your Pokémon with the greatest CP level up first to do the bulk of the damage to your enemy.

, Tapping on your enemy will cause your Pokémon to use its primary attack and lower its CP. When a Pokémon's CP reaches zero, it will faint.

, You'll want to dole out as many attacks as you can in as short a time as possible to do more damage to your enemy than it has time to do to you. If possible, use both of your thumbs!

, When you see your enemy launch an attack at you, swipe the screen left or right with your finger! When timed correctly, you'll dodge the attack and preserve your CP. This is an essential tactic when your opponent is stronger than you., Watch the blue bar underneath your CP bar. You'll notice it slowly filling up. When it's full, tap and hold on your opponent to unleash a special attack, which is more powerful than your regular combat moves.

, To defend a gym, you must find a gym that is already controlled by your team, or you must take control of a gym controlled by another team.

, Defending a gym proceeds by having a trainer choose one Pokémon to ""station"" while other trainers approach and battle it. When you take over a gym, you will be prompted to station a Pokémon there when you enter it, which will automatically battle trainers while you are away.


Station a strong Pokémon that you do not mind being without.
If the gym has low prestige, the number of Pokémon that can be stationed there is lower, and you may not be able to station one there immediately.

, For every 21 hours that you have a Pokémon stationed at a gym that is under your team's control, you will earn a defender's bonus of 10 coins., This will add up to 100 Pokécoins per day. Not bad!

, Not all PokéStops are created equal. While you can find PokéStops all around the world, PokéStops that are at placed at cultural landmarks will yield better and larger amounts of items. To find the best PokéStops, try heading to locations such as:


Monuments
Well-known buildings
Parks
Murals
Piers
College campuses
Historical sites

, Once you use a PokéStop, it will turn temporarily purple, indicating that you have visited it recently. PokéStops that are purple need time to reset before they will yield you more items, so head back to your map to look for a PokéStop that is blue if you'd like more items.


The time it takes for a PokéStop to reset is five minutes. If there are no other nearby PokéStops, you can stay around the one you're currently at and wait five minutes for it to reset.

, As your trainer gains experience, you will gain access to better items at PokéStops. Before you are level 5, you will find only Pokéballs and Eggs at PokéStops. However, as you level up, you'll have a shot at finding the full selection of items in the game, including:


Potion (Level 5) - restores 20 Combat Points (CP) when used on a Pokémon
Revive (Level 5) - restores half of the CP of a fainted Pokémon in battle
Razz Berry (Level 8) - when thrown at a Pokémon in the wild, makes it easier to catch
Super Potion (Level 10) - restores 50 CP when used on a Pokémon
Great Ball (Level 12) - a ball used to catch Pokémon, better than a Pokéball
Hyper Potion (Level 15) - restores 200 CP when used on a Pokémon
Ultra Ball (Level 20) - a ball used to catch Pokémon, better than a Great Ball

, A Lure Module is an item that is purchasable from the PokéShop. By using these at a PokéStop, you can lure Pokémon to your location for 30 minutes. This is a great tactic if you're trying to level up or just want some new Pokémon for your pack.

Avoid publicly restricted areas.,
Only play in well-lit, populated areas.,
Travel with friends.,
Bring a battery pack.,
Avoid physically treacherous areas.,
Stay alert.",How to Stay Safe While Playing Pokémon GO2," There will be some areas where Pokémon appear that aren't intended for public access. Playing Pokémon GO in these places can lead to severe legal consequences. For this reason, avoid actively searching for Pokémon, PokéStops, and gyms at:


Police stations
Airports
Schools grounds that are not your own
Private residences and yards
Courthouses
Office spaces

, Predatory Pokémon GO players may take advantage of players in vulnerable environments. You will be better-equipped to avoid being a victim of scams and other malicious activity by avoiding playing Pokémon GO in highly isolated or poorly lit areas.

, This will significantly reduce your vulnerability to predatory Pokémon GO players. Be sure to travel in groups when heading to unfamiliar areas.

, Pokémon GO drains phone battery very quickly. When you're out in the world, running out of battery can cause players to get lost or stranded far from home. Bringing a battery pack can significantly reduce this risk by extending your phone's ability to run the game for longer. Other steps to extend your battery life include:


Turning off the Augmented Reality setting. This can be done in the settings of the Pokémon GO app.
Use your phone's low battery/power saver setting, if it has one.

, Many Pokémon will be placed in natural areas such as parks, hiking trails, and by water. While this presents a great opportunity to explore the natural world, practice extreme caution when the app leads you to:


Mountainous areas
Areas with poison oak and ivy
Open bodies of water

, Maintain awareness of your physical surroundings at all times. This is especially important while crossing the street or in busy thoroughfares where inattentiveness could lead to bodily injury or put your personal belongings at risk.

On an iPhone, head to Settings -> Wallpaper & Brightness. Turn off Auto-Brightness and drag the brightness bar to its lowest option.
On an Android, go to Settings -> Device -> Brightness. Adjust your brightness to be at its lowest setting.

, When attempting to capture Pokémon, toggle the ""AR"" switch at the top-right corner of the screen to off (gray). This will significantly lessen the amount of power your phone uses during battles.

, If you're venturing from Point A to Point B (such as a Gym or PokéStop) and don't plan on catching Pokémon, find out where that location is and the directions you need to reach it. Then, close the app until you arrive so that it doesn't continue to use battery-exhausting location services while you walk.

, Zooming in and out of the map and using its 3D functions all use valuable battery life. Whenever possible, refrain from using them to extend your play time.

Head east to Route Seven.,
Enter the gatehouse to Saffron City.,
Talk to the police officer.,
Fly to Saffron City.,
Walk to Saffron City.,
Bike to Saffron City.",How to Get to Saffron City in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen," To get to Saffron City, first, you'll need to go back to Celadon City. As a reminder, this is the city where the six-story department store is located and where Erica, the grass-type master, is the gym leader. It is located directly to the West of Saffron City, connected to it by Route Seven.If you have a Pokémon who knows the ""Fly"" move (HM02), you can simply fly to Celadon City.If not, reach it from Fuchsia City via the Bike Tunnel (Route 17) or from Lavender Town via the Underground Path.;
, Once you're in Celadon City, visit the Celadon Mansion. This building, located next to Celadon's Pokémon Center, is where you probably originally received an Eevee., On the first floor of the Celadon Mansion, you should find an old woman. She is sitting at a table above and to the left of the entrance. Talk to her.

, The old woman should give you a hot tea drink. Congratulations — you now have what you need to get into Saffron City!


Since you're already at the Celadon Mansion, you may want to take the time to visit the second floor, where you can find information about Erika, the Saffron City Gym leader. This is a must if you're attempting the Fame Checker sidequest., Once you have the tea, you'll want to leave Celadon, exiting the city to the east (which is the right side of the screen). You don't necessarily need to heal your Pokémon at the Celadon City Pokémon Center, though it won't hurt — there are no enemy trainers on Route Seven.

, Route Seven is very short and safe compared to other routes — all you need to do to reach the Saffron City gate is walk south, then east (down, then right). Hop or walk down the ledge and enter the skinny, sideways facing building.


The only way to get into a fight on Route Seven is to walk through the patch of tall grass above the path you need to take. This isn't necessary to get to Saffron City, however.

, Inside the gatehouse, you'll see a police officer. Originally, this officer would have kept you from entering Saffron City. Now, however, you'll want to approach him and talk to him — he should take the tea and drink it. After this, he will let you through the gate without any harm done.


Congratulations! Exit the building to the right and you'll have made it to Saffron City!

, Once you've visited Saffron City for the first time, the easiest way to get there in the future by far is to fly there. All you need is a Pokémon that knows the Fly move (HM02) and you can reach Saffron City basically instantly from most parts of Kanto.


To fly to Saffron City, select a flying-type Pokémon in the Pokémon menu who knows Fly, then select ""Fly"" from the menu and select Saffron City on the map. Saffron is the city at the Center of the ""cross"" on the east side of the map., If you don't have a Pokémon who knows Fly in your party or you're looking for a little extra experience, you may want to walk to Saffron City. There a number of different ways to do this since Saffron is centrally located between four different towns. Below are brief directions for reaching Saffron City from each direction:


From the north: Starting in Cerulean City, head south through Route Five. Note that the northern end of the Underground Path exits into Route Five.From the south: Starting in Vermillion City, head north through the winding path of Route Six. Note that the southern end of the Underground Path exits into Route Six.From the east: Starting in Lavender Town, head west, following the road through Route Eight. Note that the end of the Underground Path exits into Route Eight.From the west: Use Route Seven as described in the section above.

, If you don't have a Pokémon who knows Fly in your party and you just want to Get to Saffron City as quick as possible, using the Bike is probably your best bet. With the bike, you can use any of the land routes listed above — you'll just be able to move through them faster.


To get the bike, you must take the Bike Voucher (obtained from the Pokémon Fan Club in Vermillion City) to the bicycle shop in Cerulean City. Normally, the bike is 1,000,000 Pokémon dollars — one more than you can ever obtain in the game.

, This cave will take you to Route 2.

, Professor Oak's aide on Route 2 will give you the essential HM05 Flash, which you'll need for the Rock Tunnel. In order to get this ability, you'll need to have caught at least 10 different species of Pokemon.

, Head back to Vermillion City and then keep going north until you reach Cerulean City.


Stock up on Potions while you're in the City. You'll be facing 15 total trainers in the Rock Tunnel, so having Potions will be helpful. You may also want to pick up a few Escape Ropes and Repels.

, This will open up Route 9, which will allow you to get to the Rock Tunnel.

, You'll have to face off against a variety of trainers along the way. Try to avoid using any of your healing items so that you can save them for the tunnel. Once you enter Route 10, you'll find a Pokémon Center directly to the south.

, The Rock Tunnel up ahead is long and tough, so make sure your Pokémon are well-rested at the Pokémon Center before heading in.

, The Flash ability will light the screen, allowing you to see as you make your way through the tunnel.

, You'll have to go down a little bit to avoid the dead end, and then back up to find the ladder. This will take you to B1F.

, This will lead you to another ladder taking you back to 1F.

, This will take you from 1F to B1F.

, This will take you to the final ladder.

, This will pop you out back on the south side of Route 10.

, Lavender Town is dominated by the Pokémon Tower, but you can't get to the upper levels until you get the Silph Scope. The Silph Scope is located in Celadon City.

, On the far west end of Route 8, you'll come to the gates of Saffron City. Unfortunately, the gates are barred, so you'll need to find a way around.


You can catch a Growlithe by using Cut on the tree to get into the fenced area, which will come in handy against the Celadon City Gym Leader.

, This building will allow you to access the Underground Path. This tunnel will pop you out on Route 7, right out of Celadon City.

, The small patch of grass on Route 7 is a great place to do some training before you take on the Gym Leader in Celadon City.

, Head to the upper-left corner of Route 7 to enter Celadon City. This is one of the largest cities in Kanto, so you'll find a whole lot to do here., The Celadon City Department Store is one of the best places to buy items in the game. You can get a variety of TMs and stones here, as well as any recovery item. You can also buy Great Balls, which are perfect for capturing elusive Pokemon.

, Talk to the Old Lady on the first floor of the Mansion to receive some Tea. Take this to the guard outside of the Saffron City gates to gain access to the City.

, If you take a party of five or less Pokémon to the back door of the Mansion, you can get an Eevee from the Know-It-All Man. Expose it to a Water Stone, Thunderstone, or Fire Stone to get a Vaporeon, Jolteon, or Flareon.

, Erika will likely be one of the easiest Gym Leaders that you face. This is because she uses Grass-type Pokemon, which have a large number of weaknesses. Fire, Ice, Bug, and Flying will all be effective against her Pokemon.

, Walk into the arcade and examine the poster in the back. You'll find a switch here, which will reveal the entrance to the Team Rocket hideout. You'll have to make your way through several floors of Rocket goons before facing off against Giovanni. Giovanni's team are vulnerable to Grass, Water, and Fighting Pokemon. Defeating Giovanni will cause him to leave his Silph Scope behind., You can use the Silph Scope to see the ghosts in the Pokémon Tower and access the upper levels.

, The Rocket Warehouse is located close to the town, and you'll need to navigate the conveyor belt maze in order to make your way through. The maze is actually pretty straightforward, and it's worth going through all of the routes to pick up the items and fight the trainers.

Type in the code below.,
Understand that if you wanted Jirachi, for example, it is #385 in the National Dex.,
Walk into some grass while holding L, once that is done.,
Basically, all you have to do is find out the number the Pokémon is in the National Dex, then make the total number of Masterballs you are carrying in the Item's Bag equivalent to this number:

",How to Get Any Pokémon on Diamond or Pearl," and buy an Action Replay.;
, Once the code is in, you will receive 493 Masterballs in the Item's Bag, or one for every Pokémon.

, You would have to put away 108 Masterballs. The reason for this is that it results in 385 Masterballs on-hand, which is necessary for the 385th Pokémon to appear using this glitch.

, If you don't get into a battle with Jirachi right away, run away from that battle, then hold L again until you get into a battle with Jirachi.

Check your Items Storage.,

Check your Bag.",How to Get 99 Items in Pokémon Light Platinum," To enable this code, you will have to make sure that the Pokémon Light Platinum ROM is loaded up on your mobile phone/computer’s GBA emulator.;
, As soon as you’ve loaded the ROM, go ahead and open the Cheats section on your emulator’s menu. If you happen to be using VBA-M (Visual Boy Advance) for Windows PCs, you can find “Cheats” under “Tools” on the emulator’s menu bar.

, Look for an option for list/add cheats and then input this code: D261DC6D197B4DC2. As its name implies, enabling this code will result in you getting 99 of an item you specify (using another code) on the first slot of your PC’s item storage., In order to complete this cheat, you’ll then need to add another code to specify the item that you want to replicate 99 times. Two must-have items that you ought to try with this code are Rare Candies (82025BCC0044) and Masterballs (DCEEEC34AFEADC26).You can only use the 99 Items code with only one of the item modifier codes enabled. Enabling two or more item modifier codes will glitch and/or crash your game.
Make sure to add the Item Modifier code as a separate code.

, Once these codes are enabled, just go ahead and start playing the game., As soon as you enter a City, make sure to head straight to the nearest Pokémon Center. If you want to get your items as fast as possible then the nearest one to your starting point (Yellow Town) would be at Central City.

, Upon entering the Pokémon Center, head to where the Nurse is and access your character’s PC through one of the terminals near her station.

, Once you’ve logged in to your PC, go ahead and check Item Storage. You should now be at a screen presenting you with the option to Withdraw, Deposit, and Toss Items.

, You only need to concern yourself with the first option. If you enabled the cheat codes earlier, you should now be seeing the 99 Potions and a glitched number for the item you specified after choosing the Withdraw Item option. Withdraw all the Potions, and you should now be left with just 99 of the specified item that you can then proceed to withdraw as well.


Don’t worry about withdrawing all the items. They will automatically replenish back to 99 so long as the cheats are enabled. This means that you’ll have an infinite supply of the items that you associated with the 99 Items Code earlier.

, After withdrawing the items, log off the PC and pause the game. If you check your character’s Bag, he/she should now have the same amount of items that was withdrawn earlier from the PC. You are then free to use these as you see fit.

It has a 5% chance of appearing, so it may take a while to encounter. The Gabite will be Level 41., Gible will evolve into Gabite when it reaches Level 24. The quickest way to raise Gible's level is to use it in as many battles as possible.

This means you'll need to upgrade the blocks you place quite a bit, since the area has a 30 item limit. You can upgrade the blocks by using the Safari Zone a lot., Once your Rocky Beach area is properly configured, you can encounter a Gible by walking around.

, The Gible you receive is only Level 1, so it will probably take a little while to raise it to Level 24.

Choose your first Pokémon.,

Get a HM slave.,
Know your move sets.",How to Finish Pokémon Diamond," Not too far in the game, you'll find a briefcase. Then, you will be attacked by a Starly. At this point, you choose your starting Pokémon. You can choose Piplup - the water type, Chimchar - the fire type, or Turtwig - the grass type. The chosen Pokémon will then battle the Starly. Note: whichever Pokémon you choose will become your starting fighter.;
, Gain experience by fighting wild Pokémon. Practice with all of your Pokémon, not just your starter. Sometimes, trainers only ever do this at the beginning of the game and forget to train later on. You only need to continue this until you find the VS Seeker. Once you find this, you can battle other trainers instead of wild Pokémon.

, At the beginning, worry less about only choosing good Pokémon. Just work at getting more. Later on, however, you should be more selective.

, Gyms are good practice. If you are unsure who to use in battle, talk to the person standing at the gym entrance. His suggestion will be based on Pokémon type matching. He does not take into account your skill with a particular Pokémon.

, All HM's apart from Surf are useless in battle. Don't waste a move slot with one of these. A HM slave is a Pokémon who you teach HM's to, you never use this Pokémon in battle. Bidoof, Bibarel, Geodude, Graveler, Marill, and Azumarill are good choices, but experiment for yourself.

, Choosing moves for your Pokémon may seem daunting, but it is really quite simple. Don't teach more than one attack to any one Pokémon. Pay attention to PP and Accuracy as well as Attack Power. A move with at least 15 PP, 90% Accuracy, and 70 attack power is alright. Teach all your Pokémon at least one basic attack move, then you can go wild with moves that will boost stats, and moves that will cause your opponents status problems.

Do not leave the battle.",How to Play Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft," You can do this after signing up for the game and downloading the client from Blizzard website. The tutorial explains the mechanics of the game, and you will have your first battle under the tutorial.


Hearthstone battle is a one-versus-one match between two opponents, a turn-based style with players taking turns to play cards from their hand casting powerful spells, equipping your hero with weapons, or summoning powerful minions to do battle on your behalf.;
, After completing the tutorial, you get to play against human players or one with an AI computer, depending on your preference.


Each player is represented by their chosen hero, an important character from the Warcraft lore.
Each hero represents a particular class, determining the special cards and unique hero power.
Each hero in the battlefield holds 30 Health. If that number is reduced to zero, the hero is destroyed and that concludes the game.

, This can be found in the main menu.

, You will be able to start customizing your own deck.

, Then name the deck by clicking the default name and typing in the name you want. Press Enter if you're done.


All cards are drawn by the player during a game.
A pre-made basic deck for each class is made available to the player once that hero has been unlocked, but players are free to create their own custom decks with which to do battle. This is useful for players who wish to create a strategy of their own.
Keep in mind that in standard play, you only get to put 2 of the same card in each deck and only 1 of each legendary card.
In the arena, however, players can pick up the same card unlimited times.
You can have up to 9 custom decks at any time, and you can also name them.
There are many types of decks—control decks, aggro decks, and mid-game decks. Although many decks combine elements of each of these styles, the selection of class allows for additional customization, with certain classes having a natural synergy with certain types of deck.

, To add cards in your deck, simply choose any card you wanted in the list on the left side of the screen and then click it.

, This option is located in the bottom right of your screen.

, Creating an aggro deck is suited for players who takes an aggressive approach in dealing damage to the opponent as quickly as possible, generally through the summoning of a large number of low-value minions.


Aggro decks are often weak against an area of effect spells, such as Arcane Explosion and Whirlwind. These can single-handedly wipe out a board full of low-health minions, making them one of the best counters to an early aggro deck.
The use of low-cost minions allows aggro decks to put several into play very early in the game, allowing them to take control of the board and put pressure on the opponent to defend themselves. This is effective with a hero that possesses skills that can summon minions like Paladin or Shaman.
A deck full of minions that summons another minion when put into play is another strategy for aggro deck. If you're aiming for this build, focus on low mana cost, minion summoning, and cards with attack buff.

, Druid class has the worst starting deck of all the classes, and players who try out this class may be discouraged by the starter build. However, the druid class can be great if you have unlocked the important card between level 2 and level 10.


This guide works for other magic users as well, such as Mages.
The magic deck is considered as mid-game deck, and as the name implies, this build works effectively in the middle of the game, with enough mana and magic cards in hand.
Magic decks work well if you have a mix of minions and spells. Going too spell-heavy or too minion-heavy may actually hurt you.
Cards like Swipe and Starfire benefit greatly for spell-power buffs, allowing you to hit harder than you would.
Minions such as Dalaran Mage with their +1 spell damage buff can combo well with Mage and Druid decks.
If you want to try this deck, build it with + 1 spell damage and cards with magic cast and area damage.
Cards that inflict 1 damage to all summoned enemies in the play is useful for this deck, especially against aggro decks. Added with spell damage, the 1 damage will increase depending on how many minions with +1 spell damage buff are in play.

, If you don't have good premium cards, creating a beginner deck will be useful until you reach beyond level 10. The beginner deck is consist of Murloc cards in par with aggro deck that ends game with its quantity.


Be reminded that Murloc has low HP, but the low mana requirement makes this card effective in the early part of the game.

, During the tutorial, you're automatically given your very first hero, Jaina Proudmoore, which represents the Mage class. This hero possesses magic attack Fireblast, which can be used against any target and can bypass units with taunt.


This hero power can be used strategically to remove Divine Shield from an enemy or to hit one of your minions with Enrage to make them stronger. Despite of being a magic attack, Fireblast is not affected by spell damage.

,


Malfurion Stormrage represents the Druid class in Hearthstone. This too focuses on magic attacks.

Druids have the ability to shapeshift, a buff that gives + attack for one turn and + 1 armor that stacks and remain throughout the game.


Rexxar represents the Hunter class. Hunters possess the hero power Steady Shot, which deals 2 damage directly to the enemy hero. While it is very effective for bypassing enemy minions, the Hunter cannot use Steady Shot on any other target.

Steady Shot is a reliable source of damage, and works with an aggressive approach to build pressure on the opponent.


Uther the Lightbringer, or Sir Uther Lightbringer, represents the Paladin class.

Paladins have a unique ability, Reinforce, that summons a 1/1 Silver Hand recruit. This can be used together with cards that work well with more minions on the field like Raid Leader and Frostwolf Warlord.


Anduin Wrynn represents the Priest class.

Priests are masters of healing and can heal themselves and their minions using their hero power. Priest deck card consist of minions that can heal and even buff.


Valeera Sanguinar represents the Rogue class. Rogues are backstabbing assassins known for their stealth, speed, and deadly efficiency.

Rogues possess the hero power Dagger Master. Rogues can equip 1/2 dagger, which enable them to attack either a minion or hero.


Thrall represents the Shaman.

Shamans possess the hero skill Totemic Call, which can summon a random totem. Totems are helpful for survival or for aggressive play. Every time you use the shaman hero power, it will randomly summon a healing totem, which heals all damaged friendly minions for 1 health at the end of your turn.
Stone Claw totem is a summon with 0/2 with taunt. Searing totem is a minion that has 1/1, similar to silver hand recruit from Paladin's Hero Power. Wrath of Air totem is a summon with 0/2 + 1 spell power.


Gul'dan represents the Warlock class.

This character has two hero powers, Inferno and Life Tap. Inferno summons a 6/6 Infernal while Life Tap draws a card, and in return, you will receive 2 damage.


Garrosh Hellscream represents the Warrior class. His hero power is Armor Up, which gives 2 Armor and can be used in every turn for 2 mana. It stacks and is useful for survival.

The premier mechanic of the Warrior class is Enrage, which gives an attack buff to a creature when it takes damage, like Amani Berserker and Grommash Hellscream.



, When you start a new account, doing Practice mode can help get new heroes and gain exp to get the basic cards in your hero's class. Playing in practice mode will help you to learn the basics of the game, or you can put your new deck to the test before playing in the Play mode.


There is also something called Adventure mode. Adventure mode is where you battle other heroes from different classes that are not possible to earn for your own heroes. You can gain more exp, and other rewards from beating these heroes.

, You can play against other real players of similar skill in random matches. Players can choose to play Casual Friendly or take part in ranked play, earning ranks and special rewards.


In Casual mode, you can play against a random play to gain exp, cards, or just for fun. These games can be useful for upgrading your hero more.
In Ranked mode, gain stars to move up ranks. Once you reach at least rank 20, at the end of the month, you will get some rewards, like card packs, one kind of card, or coins.

, Play with players forging a new deck from random selection of cards before using it to do battle in series of games. Doing well in Arena can grant substantial rewards, but each admission costs gold. If you lose 4 times, you will have to get admission with some gold.

, Players can also choose to challenge players on their friends list. To do this, simply click your friend's name in the list and then choose Duel. Challenging friends can be just for fun, or to gain exp for your hero.

, Each week, there is a new twist to the Tavern Brawl. For example, there can be a tavern brawl that gives you more mana to use, or there can be a tavern brawl where your deck is only one type of card and some spells. These twists can help you win, and give you a card pack if you win at least one game. You can also brawl your friends as well., Quests are special objectives players can complete to earn gold and, occasionally, special cards. You get new daily quests each day, up to a maximum of three.


Quests are the main way for players to earn gold.
If you don't like the idea to do a 40 gold quest, just exchange it for another one! You can only do this once per day.

, If you have poor Internet connection, which can lead to disconnection, during a game of Hearthstone, the system will give you 60 seconds to re-log into the game, in which case you will immediately be returned to the game you're playing.


The game will not be paused during disconnections, meaning that returning players may find their turn has expired or the state of the battle has progressed.
Reconnect feature is currently enable in the Americas region, but not in other regions.

, When you first start playing Bad Piggies, you’ll only have access to the first set of levels, categorized as “Ground Hog Day.”

, After the game launches, you’ll be shown a screen with six empty boxes placed in a grid pattern, along with various supplies at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to drag and drop each of the supplies into the grid to create a vehicle that can be used to transport your piggy to the finish line. For example, level one provides you with two wheels and three boxes.

, For example, in level one you must move both wheels to the bottom of the grid, then place all three boxes on top of the wheels to create a boxcar, or wagon.

, This places the piggy in the vehicle so it can be driven to the finish line.

, Your vehicle will start driving by itself toward the finish line. Once you’ve crossed the finish line, you can advance to the next level., These buttons feature extra tools such as balloons, bottle rockets, motors, and engines that can be used throughout the journey to help you reach the finish line.

, When pointing downward toward the ground, Soda Bottles allow your vehicle to fly high so you can conquer hills and collect stars.

, This allows you to see whether any hills, gaps, or other obstacles should be taken into consideration so you can build a vehicle that takes your piggy to the finish line.

, Not all vehicles must be built in a traditional manner to help you advance toward the finish line.

, This can help prevent your vehicle from surging forward and crashing when all soda bottles are activated at the same time.

, The goal of these levels is to cross the finish line with your entire vehicle intact.

, Longer vehicles are less likely to tip over than shorter vehicles, and will help you maintain balance.

, Your vehicle may end up driving more efficiently when weight is distributed properly."

, Coins are necessary for gameplay. A good way of getting coins is getting new animals. Try breeding the animals you already have, or buying new ones. Completing battles as the victor in the Battlegrounds also earns you coins (and food).

, Gems aren't as necessary as coins, but it's a good idea to get some. You can do this by completing quests.

, Choose two animals to breed together. Be careful or you could get an animal you already have! Try breeding different elements.

, When your animal reaches a certain level, you can't feed it until you evolve it by placing it in the Evolution Flower.

, Your animal is now adolescent.

, You can evolve your animals several times, but it takes a lot of time, because as they grow they need lots more food.

, If you have enough Coins, upgrade them. Upgrading them will allow you to grow different foods, like Rune Prunes and Mystic Mangos.

,, You now have food. Certain crops will produce more food than others, but Aura Apples, which give you the least food by themselves, produce food faster. Choose wisely.

, The animals' ancient Battlegrounds are tricky to navigate. You don't know who your opponent will be until you're fighting them. But luckily, you usually have at least two stamina when entering the ring.

, For example: Fire is weak to Water, Plant is weak to Fire, and so on.

Lead the way with the Tank Build.",How to Play Azmodan in Heroes of the Storm," Globe of Annihilation is Azmodan’s Q ability, which summons a gigantic globe that can travel a long distance and strike a large area for direct damage. This skill is exceptionally effective at clearing out minion waves, and can deal a significant amount of damage when used against tightly-clustered enemy teams. Azmodan has a lot of talents that improve Globe of Annihilation.


There are talents that increase its damage based on the distance traveled or based on the number of minions you kill with it. Then you have talents that speed up its travel time while dealing minor damage over time, reduce its mana cost and cause it to spawn a Demon Warrior should it hit an enemy.;
, Summon Demon Warrior is Azmodan’s W ability, which spawns a Demon Warrior that attacks the nearest hostile target and moves on to the nearest enemy lane. This ability’s most obvious use is to assist in pushing lanes, but it can also be used off-lane to scout around and give you a heads-up if an enemy is attempting to flank your position. It can be talented to increase the damage of the Demons while reducing the ability’s mana cost, as well as another talent so that the Demons receive less damage from non-heroic sources while wrapping them in a damaging aura.

, All Shall Burn is Azmodan’s E ability, which causes him to shoot out a laser from his hand to deal continuous damage that increases the longer the target is being attacked. Targets that don’t get away fast enough will suffer significant damage, making it exceptionally useful against towers, mercenaries and disabled enemy targets. It can be talented to reduce its mana cost while increasing the damage to structures, return a portion of the damage dealt, increase its maximum damage and be able to walk around at a reduced speed while using the ability.


Do note that All Shall Burn will be interrupted if Azmodan is stunned or if the target moves out of range.

, Black Pool is Azmodan’s first ultimate ability, which creates a pool of darkness around the target area which increases the damage of Azmodan’s abilities, basic attacks and summoned minions. This skill gives Azmodan the ability to deal significantly more damage over a short period of time, especially when coupled with properly-talented abilities. Its level 20 talent, Fifth Circle, slows both the attack and movement speeds of targets damaged by Azmodan’s abilities and basic attacks while under the effect of Black Pool.

, These Demonic Grunts can absolutely wreck enemy minions and structures, as well as unguarded mercenary camps. Toss it down when a lane is left unguarded, and watch the Grunts break down fortresses in the blink of an eye, especially when supported by minion waves and capture mercenaries.

, General of Hell is Azmodan’s trait, which creates a Demon Lieutenant at a targeted minion, mercenary or summon that you can target from anywhere in the map. The Lieutenant boosts the damage and maximum health of all nearby friendly minions, mercenaries and summons by 15%. This active trait gives Azmodan the ability to significantly improve both the attack and survivability of minion waves and charging mercenaries, especially since you can use General of Hell on any target across the map no matter where you are., The Demon Lord build is all about talenting Azmodan to make his summoned minions as deadly as possible while giving him the ability to quickly capture mercenary camps in the process. Azmodan can use Bribe, General of Hell, Summon Demon Warrior and Demonic Invasion to apply intense pressure on one unguarded lane before going off to support his teammates on the objective. Picking Mercenary Lord and Bolt of the Storm makes it a lot easier for Azmodan to push a single lane and giving him a much-needed escape option if he gets caught alone, while picking Army of Hell and Forced Recruitment give Azmodan the ability to more easily push multiple lanes simultaneously. This is not a build optimized for combat though, so the Demon Lord will not be as effective in team fights as other builds.



Talent Build: Bribe > Mercenary Lord OR Army of Hell > Bound Minion > Demonic Invasion > Hellforged Armor > Demonic Smite > Forced Recruitment OR Bolt of the Storm

, This build is all about capitalizing on All Shall Burn’s potential to do a ridiculous amount of damage against single targets. This gives Azmodan the option to quickly burn down bases that have been left unguarded or to fight on the front lines with his teammates as he focuses down vulnerable enemy heroes. This build relies heavily on All Shall Burn, which means that Azmodan will not be as effective if he is targeted by stuns as he focuses a target down. He will also be less effective the target’s mobility allows it to quickly escape Azmodan’s reach. Still, the Burner will prove to be a very real threat that the enemy team has to deal with or risk receiving huge damage if left unchecked.



Talent Build: Master of Destruction > Sin’s Grasp > Infused Power > Black Pool > March of Sin > Blood for Blood > Fifth Circle

, If the Burner is all about All Shall Burn, then the Bombardier is all about Globe of Annihilation. This build improves Azmodan’s ability to neutralize large enemy minion waves from afar while punishing enemy teams that stick too close together during teamfights. Sieging Wrath is the preferred talent in most situations, but Taste for Blood can give you more damage in situations where you have a teammate that coordinates his or her abilities to damage enemy minion waves so that you can more easily kill waves with Globe (e.g., Tassadar’s Psionic Storm, Sylvanas’ Shadow Dagger + Haunting Wave, Jaina’s Blizzard, Kael’thas’ Flame Strike, etc.).


Blood for Blood is also the preferred pick in most situations, but Battleborn gives Azmodan the ability to snipe enemy heroes and prevent them from turning in objectives in certain maps (e.g., the Dragon Statue in Dragon Shire, Blackheart in Blackheart’s Bay, Tributes in Cursed Hollow, and Shrines in the Tomb of the Spider Queen). This build, however, is not as effective when Globe of Annihilation is on cooldown and will become very inefficient if the Globes are reliably landed on multiple enemy heroes at once.

Talent Build: Sieging Wrath OR Taste for Blood > Sin’s Grasp > Infernal Globe > Black Pool > Hedonism > Blood for Blood OR Battleborn > Fifth Circle

, Azmodan has a very large health pool, which is surprising considering his specialist class. This allows you to build Azmodan in such a way that you boost his survivability on the battlefield while dealing enough damage to force the enemy to deal with him. You can effectively turn Azmodan into a front-line fighter to lead the way, which is extremely useful if your team does not have a warrior in its roster or needs an extra hand in absorbing some damage.


March of Sin is generally better than Relentless, but the latter talent is invaluable if you find yourself being the target of many stuns, slows, roots and other disables. Blood for Blood is also a good pick against enemy teams with lots of high-health warriors, while Imposing Presence is best used when the enemy team has a lot of heroes that deal heavy damage with their basic attacks (e.g., Illidan, Raynor, Valla, Tychus, etc.).

Talent Build: Master of Destruction > Gluttony > Gluttonous Ward > Black Pool > March of Sin OR Relentless > Blood for Blood OR Imposing Presence > Bolt of the Storm

The N64 controller’s revolutionary analog stick works much better with this game because it was designed for this game. Using any other controller feels somewhat awkward.
The console itself is sturdier than the newer technology that comes out these days. These things were made to survive a nuclear blast.
This guide will refer only to the N64 controller. However, don't be discouraged if you're stuck using the Virtual Console controller. It feels different but it is largely the same.;
, The N64 controller streamlined 3D gaming with the analog stick, so movement in a 3D environment is now hard to imagine without it. The analog stick is key to understanding this game along with most other 3D games.


Ignore the left handle (the one with the D-pad). It is a sad, pathetic waste of plastic that is the one design flaw in the controller. Grip the center handle with your left hand, so that your thumb rests over the analog stick and your index finger rests on the Z-trigger (I'll explain that later).  Grip the right handle with your right hand.
No need for a run button.  Unlike the original Super Mario Bros. on the Nintendo Entertainment System where you held B while moving in order to run, the analog stick does everything.  Running, walking, and tiptoeing are all possible depending on how much you tilt the control stick with your thumb.
You can make Mario run around in endless circles by slowly rotating the control stick.  This was truly innovative in 1996 and a good example of the freedom of movement allowed with an analog stick.  Give it a whirl.

, Even to this day, developers of 3D games struggle to find the right perspective to utilize so the player can see what needs to be seen on screen.  Since SM64 was one of the first, its system is dated and difficult to use at times.  The camera is controlled by the four yellow C-buttons (yes, four C-buttons), each containing a directional arrow. Press the one with the up arrow and the camera zooms in, allowing you to look around. Press the down C-button to zoom out and press the left and right C-buttons to swing the camera to the left and right, respectively. Sounds easy? Good! Don't ignore it.


The camera system screws up on its own, so sometimes manual adjustment is imperative.
You do not want Mario running toward the camera or to a spot off camera that could lead to your possible death in the game. This game contains lava, ice water, quicksand, and bottomless pits. Oh yes, and there's also a world where you ride a magic carpet in the sky along a rainbow.  You need to set the camera so that you can see where you're going!
Setting the camera at the right angle can uncover a secret below, above, or to the side of you. 
Practice running around while adjusting the camera view with the left and right C-buttons. Note that the camera is always reluctant to shift and is constantly re-centering itself. Sometimes you have to tap the left and right buttons more than once for the ideal angle.

,  Mario's got the moves, over twenty in his arsenal, but all can be reduced to three simple actions: jumping, punching, and crouching.  You jump with the blue A button, punch with the green B button, and crouch with the Z-trigger that your left index finger is resting on.  Here are a few key things to remember when using these buttons.


Jumping is the most important of these actions, as it has defined Mario since his 2D iterations.  Learn to time your jumps.
You can almost get away with completely ignoring the punch button.  Most enemies can be easily avoided or killed with the classic jumping attack (making pancakes out of Goombas). 
Some enemies, such the first boss, can be picked up by Mario by pressing the punch button when standing behind them.
Crouching isn't necessary most of the time, but it leads to some of more advanced moves that Mario can do.  More on that later.

, This is the perfect opening for the game, as there are no enemies, and you have a small little field to practice all of your moves. Take your time, and just have fun moving Mario around.  Here are a few things you can try.


Mario can climb trees and poles in this game.  Outside in the garden are plenty of trees to climb.  To do this, just jump toward the tree and Mario will automatically grab onto it.  You can then climb up and down it or jump right off by pressing the jump button again.
Master the triple jump.  This will bring style to your game and will allow you to reach higher platforms. To perform a triple jump, keep running, and then jump, and then jump again right when Mario lands, and then repeat once more, all while running forward.  You will be amazed. You will also fly if you're wearing a certain cap with wings.
Swim.  Just jump into the water and press A for a breast stroke.  Tilt the control stick down and press A to dive into the water.  Hold A for a slow flutter kick which will allow you to swim underwater in a more controlled manner.  You can do breast strokes underwater, but believe me, it is difficult at first.

, It is the link to all 15 worlds in Mario's first 3D outing, where the majority of the game's action takes place. There's no point in explaining the story of the game (it's a Mario game after all), so here is the concept:


The goal of this game is to collect stars in the 15 worlds in this game to unlock other parts of the castle. You do this until you reach Bowser's lair on the top floor. Each world contains 7 stars along with scattered ones hidden in the castle.  You find stars through exploration and completing certain mission objectives in each world.
Not every star is necessary in order to complete the game.  There is a reward for those committed gamers who collect all 120 stars, but in the end, that isn't necessary to save the princess.  You need only 70.  This gives the gamer options, to complete the levels they want from the world's they want to spend more time exploring.  If there's a swimming level that doesn't quite tickle your fancy (world 3), then neglect it, and collect stars from other worlds.
The castle paintings are the portal to the various worlds in this game.  To enter the first world, enter the door to your left after entering the castle, and you will find a giant painting of a walking, ticking bomb (called a bob-omb).  Jump into the painting and that will take you to world 1. Look for paintings throughout the castle. This is your link to the games numerous worlds.

,  By today's gaming standards, the difficulty of the game is rather modest.  The developers, realizing at the the time that they were creating a new way to play games, did their best to make the game as accessible as possible.  Therefore, the game is forgiving, perhaps since the game itself has some glitches and hiccups that can screw over players.


There is no timer. This allows the player to focus on exploration instead of just going from point A to B.
Refill your life meter with coins. You earn coins by finding them throughout the world. Some are well hidden, concealed in the iconic question mark block, and some are easily viewable out in the open.
Find all of the cap power ups. Mario can fly, turn into metal, or gain invincibility temporarily by finding certain caps hidden in blocks. These power ups must first be unlocked by finding secret passages in the castle. Good luck.

,  For example, while running, if you press the Z-trigger and then the A button, Mario will perform a long jump. This is an advanced move that isn't required to complete this game, but it is awesome!


Hold Z and then press A to do a back flip.  If you press B instead then you will do spinning kick on the floor. Mario's got some mad breakdancing' skills.
Jump and then press Z to do a butt-stomp.
Run, jump, and then press the B button to do a diving attack.
Run in one direction, and then quickly tilt the control stick in the opposite direction and press A.  This will cause Mario to do a quick somersault, one of my favorite moves for reaching high ledges. Practice!
Hold Z and move the control stick around for some laughs.

,  If you can play SM64, then you at least know the basic concept for most 3D games.  Here are some examples.


The Grand Theft Auto games.  Liberty City is your hub world, linking all of the mission objectives contained in the game.  Just as in Mario, you can explore the hub world and complete the missions that you want to as you please.  Now running over innocent pedestrians, that's an innovative feature the Grand Theft Auto series introduced.
Most games implement some sort of camera system.  However, instead of using four yellow buttons to change the angle, most games use the dual analog system today, an evolution of the original N64 controller.  One analog stick is used to control player movement, and the other is used to control the camera.
Platforming games, such as SM64, have changed over time in the way they approach exploration versus platforming skills.  For example, new games mix in portions with camera control and portions without.  More focus on fast-paced action instead of exploration, combining the best parts of 2D and 3D platforming into a collage of awesomeness.

, This is far more important than any other decision you will have to make, because if you buy a brilliant console and none of the games are to your liking, why bother? Although most consoles support a huge mix of games, they are usually better at some things than others.

, Bear in mind that saving up for a while and getting a better console than you would have may be a good idea.

, You don't even need to do that much, just check around the internet or talk to people you know. If all your friends have one console and play online regularly, then you may be more inclined to invest in that one. Just do general research and find out background information. Read reviews, weigh up what the advantages and disadvantages of each console you're interested are.

, Yes, literally walk, with your feet, to where you see the rustling grass on the map! When you approach the spot, a Pokémon may appear on your screen.

, When you get close enough to a Pokémon, tap on it to enter the game's ""capture"" mode. It's battle time., A Pokémon's Combat Points, or CP level, is the number shown in the grey bar above its head, and it denotes their strength. A Pokémon with a low CP level will be easier to capture than a Pokémon with a high level.

, There are different types of Pokéballs you can use to capture Pokémon, and they yield different levels of effectiveness. A Pokéball is the most basic and weakest kind of ball to use - it's also the kind of Pokéball you receive as you start the game.


You can stock up on Pokéballs at a PokéStop, which will be discussed more in this article.
You can also buy PokéBalls at the PokéShop.

, Look for the ring that sits inside the circle where the Pokémon is standing. It'll be red, orange, or green depending on how difficult the Pokémon is to capture. It'll also change in size; when this ring is at its smallest, the Pokémon is most vulnerable and your chances at capturing it are highest (but only if your Pokéball lands within the ring).

, You'll throw a Pokéball at it. If you miss, or the Pokémon bursts out of the Pokéball, you can try again until it flees. If it runs away, don't fret - return to your map, and move on to your next attempt at finding and capturing a Pokémon!

, The single most important factor that affects your ability to successfully capture Pokémon is the technique you use to fling a Pokéball at it. To throw a Pokéball, simply use your finger to flick the Pokéball towards the Pokémon on the screen. To improve your throws, be sure to:



Get your angle right. If you accidentally throw your Pokéball too far to the left or right, you'll miss the Pokémon.

Use the right amount of force. A slower, shorter flick will cause you to throw the ball with less force. A quick, longer flick will cause the ball to fly faster and longer. Try to throw the ball with some force, but be sure not to overshoot the Pokémon during your throw!

Turn off Augmented Reality. Battles in Augmented Reality require you to have greater throwing precision as you try to capture Pokémon. To have a better shot at catching them, turn off AR in the game's settings.

, As you venture around the world, look for floating blue cubes on your map. These are PokéStops, where you can acquire valuable gear for your journey as a Pokémon trainer.

, As you approach it, it will change shape, turning into a medal shaped like a Pokéball. This signals that you are close enough to use the PokéStop.

, This will bring up a close-up view of the PokéStop.

, A number of items will appear around the medal.

,, After you use a PokéStop, it will turn purple, indicating that you've recently used it and it needs time to reset before you can collect more items from it. To collect more items, head to a PokéStop that appears on your map as blue.

, Gyms are places around the world where Pokémon trainers meet up to battle each other. To learn the different ways to level up your Pokémon trainer, check out the Strategy and Advanced Tips section.

, Gyms are the largest objects that appear on your map. You can recognize them as tall pedestals surrounded by light.


Gyms are most likely to be found in prominent meeting places, so if you can't see one in your immediate vicinity, try zooming out on your map.

, This will lower the other Pokémon's CP. When one Pokémon's CP reaches 0, it will faint, and the next Pokémon in the pack will be sent to fight.

, If the enemy has just sent an attack towards you, consider dodging it to save your CP instead of immediately attacking them back.

, When you start out the game, you will be given a choice between Squirtle, Charmander, and Bulbasaur as your starter Pokémon. If you walk away from all three of these Pokémon and wait for them to reappear on your map near you, the fourth time, you will eventually see Pikachu appear along with them.

, Not all PokéStops are created equal! PokéStops located at more central locations tend to yield better items. To find Pokéstops with serious plunder, check out locations such as:


Monuments
Well-known buildings
Parks
Museums
Graveyards
College Campuses

, At some Pokéstops, you'll be able to collect eggs. After walking a certain distance with an egg in your pack, it will hatch, adding a Pokémon to your team without you having to catch it.

, As you journey through the world, you have opportunities to gain experience that will allow you to level up as a trainer. At level 5, you can access gyms where you can battle other trainers. As you level up, you will also begin to encounter rarer, more powerful Pokémon in the world and have access to better items at PokéStops. You gain different levels of experience for completing different tasks, and the amount of experience you gain increases once you become a more powerful trainer. Here are some things you can do to level up your trainer and the XP rewards you get from them at the beginning of the game:100 XP – Pokémon Caught
500 XP – New Pokémon
10 XP – Curve Ball
10 XP – Nice Throw
50 XP – Great Throw
100 XP – Excellent Throw
50 XP – Checking in at a PokéStop
100 XP – Battling a Pokémon Trainer at a Gym
150 XP – Beating a Pokémon Trainer at a Gym
50 XP – Beat a Pokémon in training at a Gym
200 XP – Hatch a Pokémon
500 XP – Evolve a Pokémon

, When you're battling another trainer, you can charge up a special attack by holding a long tap on the screen and letting it go when the bar is full. These attacks are more powerful than your Pokémon's regular combat moves.


This takes a long time to charge up, so it may not be possible during all gym battles.

, All Pokémon have types that are strong against certain other types and weak against others. When battling, try to match your Pokémon up against a Pokémon that will give yours an advantage. This chart shows you which Pokémon are stronger and weaker against others (the arrow points to the strongest types).

, Pokémon Go will devour your battery if you don't take measures to save it. To do this, tap the Pokéball icon at the bottom of your screen and then the ""Settings"" icon at the top-right. Tap on the ""Battery Saver"" option for a greatly-improved battery life.

Tap the Pokémon when you get close enough to see it in the map screen.",How to Locate Pokémon in Pokémon GO1," You should see a gray rectangle in the bottom left hand corner of your home/map screen. This gray rectangle is your nearby tracking box. This box will help you find Pokémon that are close to you.;
, It will show you up to 9 Pokémon that are relatively close to you. If you have seen or captured the Pokémon before, it will show up as a picture of the actual Pokémon. If you have never seen or captured a Pokémon before, it will show up as a silhouette.

, If a Pokémon has no footprints underneath it, it is extremely close to you, probably within catching distance. If a Pokémon has one footprint underneath it, it’s relatively close to you. Two footprints means it’s farther, and three footprints means it’s even farther.


Once you’ve clicked on the nearby tracking box in the home screen, you will have brought up the nearby tracking box. This will show up to 9 Pokémon. If you click the “X” and minimize it again, it will show three nearby Pokémon in its minimized mode.
However, if you want to track one particular Pokémon, open the nearby tracking box and tap the Pokémon you want to track.

You can incubate your Eggs in small increments. If you want to hatch a 2km Egg, you can walk 1km, 0.5km, and 0.5km all on different days, and your Egg will still hatch.

, Without your doing anything, the app will open a screen that says “Oh?” The Egg will then crack, and your Pokémon will appear!, When your Egg hatched, it vacated its space in the Incubator. Take advantage of the empty space. Put another one of your unhatched Eggs in the Incubator.

, Flip a bike upside down and attach your phone to the inside of one of the wheel's spokes. Pedal the bike with your hands and the Pokémon GO app will register movement, allowing an Egg in your possession to hatch as if you were walking.

, With duct tape, secure your phone very carefully to the blade of a standing fan or to the top of a ceiling fan. With the fan on, Pokémon GO will register movement and make it possible to hatch your Egg.


If you are using a standing fan, make sure that its base is secure and can handle the weight of the phone without falling over.
The farther from the center of the fan you tape the phone, the more quickly it will cover distance.

, With the record player turned on, your phone will spin around the perimeter and cover distance on the Pokémon app as if you were walking.

, Doing this can cause the game's location function to glitch, making your trainer avatar ""walk"" erratically near your location without you ever moving around.

While certain types are not advised over others, a basic team of six should have at least one of the following:


A flying type
A fire type
A water type
A grass type
An electric type
A physic type;
, In order to evolve Pokémon, you need a certain amount of the basic Pokémon's candies. These amounts range from 12-400 candies depending on the Pokémon, and you'll also want to have more to power them up. There are three basic ways to get candies, each with different amounts:

Catch more Pokémon. For each Pokémon you catch, you'll be awarded 3 candies. This might seem like a small amount, but it adds up very quickly and if you're in the right spot, you'll be swimming in candies in no time.
Transfer Pokémon. Aside from the fact that this will free up space in your Pokémon Storage System, it will also award you 1 candy for each transfer. Just remember to not transfer your highest CP Pokémon, as this should be used for the powering up and evolving process.
Hatch eggs. The amount of candies given per eggs depend on four things: The type of egg, the type of Pokémon, the rarity of the Pokémon and its stats. You never know how many candies you'll get, so try to hatch as many eggs as you can.

, This is needed to power up Pokémon. There are two simple ways to do this:

Catch Pokémon. You'll be awarded about 200 stardust per catch, and you'll also earn some XP and candies as a bonus.
Become a defender. Go to your local team gym and add one of your Pokémon to it. Try to choose a gym with a lot of higher CP Pokémon that is harder to defeat. That way, you will have a steady flow of stardust and Pokécoins once a day over the course of a week.

, That way, you'll save time and resources needed for later powering-up and evolving. You'll also be able to have a higher chance of having a better Pokémon., Simply click the ""Power-Up"" button in the Pokémon screen and watch as your Pokémon's stats change dramatically. Repeat until your Pokémon's CP meter is maxed out. By now, it's time to begin evolving., The maximum CP will be increased more and the bar will be filled quicker if you do so. If you don't remember which Pokémon has maximum CP, just organize your Pokémon by CP in the storage system., Just click the button that says ""Evolve"" and watch the magic happen! Make sure to check and see if you need to evolve it further. If so, you might want to begin collecting more stardust and candies. If not, proceed with the evolving process., Make sure to power-up before you evolve so the stats are better, and repeat this process until the Pokémon can no longer evolve and has maximum CP., That way, your team leader will give you advice on whether or not they should be used in a battle. Write the more important notes on paper so you don't forget!, This will help you identify them when you build your team and when you want to check their stats., This can be of your team color or another team's color. Either way, you'll need to be right at the gym's location to do this, so make sure that's where you are., Open up the team menu and choose the six Pokémon that you chose earlier. Now, make sure they are all fully healed and ready to go, and close the menu., Do this so you can test how powerful your new Pokémon team is and maybe gain a new gym for your team. Nothing is better than ending a day of making a Pokémon team with taking over a gym for your team."

Throw a Pokéball at Pikachu to catch it.",How to Catch Pikachu in Pokémon GO2," Catching Pikachu in the wild is a little more difficult, but is possible. He can appear anywhere, but he has been reportedly found frequently near power plants and science museums, presumably because of his connection to electricity. If you have a power plant or another source of electricity local to you, this may be a good place to check first., Trainers have also seen Pikachu appear as late as 3am. Try waiting until very late to up your chances of encountering Pikachu in the wild.

, When Pikachu is near, you'll see its silhouette appear in the sidebar in the bottom-right corner of your screen.

If there is one, it means the Pokémon is only a few meters or so away. If there are two, it means that the Pokémon is slightly further, and with three it is even farther., If the Pokémon is on the top left hand corner it means it is closer to you than all the other Pokémon. If it is on the bottom right hand corner, it is further away than other Pokémon., Be sure to keep an eye on the grid.

If you see the Pokémon change its position on the grid, judge if you are going the right way. If it is on the top row and before it was on the bottom row, you are getting closer.
If you find that the Pokémon is on the bottom row and before it was higher up, you should turn around and walk the opposite direction

The one with more CP and HP will be more powerful in the battlefield.This strategy works best for Pokémon that you can collect a lot of (like Pidgey or Rattata). If you get two rarer Pokémon, you might want to save them and not transfer them to Professor Willow.

,,, Transferring a Pikachu to Professor Willow will give you Pikachu Candy. You cannot undo a transfer. Do not transfer the Pokémon if it is your last Pokémon; you won’t have one left to evolve!You will get one Candy for each Pokémon you transfer to Professor Willow."

Find a friend with Mew.,
Build up good trade stock.,
Make the trade.",How to Get Mew in Pokémon FireRed1," Trading for Mew is the only legitimate way to obtain a Mew in FireRed anymore. Mew is an Event Pokémon, and was only available during a single event in 2006.


There is a glitch that people claim will work to find Mew, but this only works in the original Pokémon games. It does not work in Fire Red.;
, Mew is exceedingly rare, and your friend won't likely give it up easily. You'll need to sweeten the pot, so ensure that you have a good selection and be prepared to part with multiple top-tier Pokémonto get it.


Any of the Legendaries make for good trade stock. This includes Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. Also, if you have some of the event Legendaries, such as Lugia and Ho-oh, these will make your trade much easier.
Mewtwo will most likely need to be traded in order for your Mew trade to happen.

EV-train your trade stock. A group of Pokémon that have been expertly EV-trained will command a much better trade value than freshly-caught Pokémon. Invest some time to build up your team before you start the trade.

, When you've finally convinced your friend to make the trade, connect your systems and get it done! Walk away knowing that you have one of the rarest Pokémon in the game, and that you got it legitimately.

Battle the existing Pokémon in the gym to claim the gym, if you are planning to claim the gym.,
Wait, if you are not claiming the gym.,
Challenge your friend in a battle at the gym, if your friend claimed the gym.",How to Battle Friends in Pokémon GO," If you have not reached Level 5, you will not be allowed to join a team or go to the gym.;
, There are three teams in Pokémon GO: Team Instinct (yellow), Team Mystic (blue), and Team Valor (red).These teams battle for control of the gyms. Right now, there is no way to change teams in Pokémon GO.

, Since Pokémon GO is based off of GPS location, you and your friend will need to be physically together in order to go to the same gym. You can only battle other Pokémon at a gym you’re physically close to.

, Look on the map screen for gyms. Gyms are huge towers that rise higher above the ground than anything else in the game. Sometimes you will see a Pokémon on top of the gym. The gyms will be blue, yellow, or red. If you are on the blue team, look for a blue gym, etc.

, To find one, you may need to walk around your area for a while or go to a more populated area, like a town center.


If you and your friend are on the same team, you should try to find a gym of that same color. This way, you can engage in friendly battle, where your Pokémon will give up the fight with 1 HP (hit point) rather than “passing out.”

, You will see options for choosing which Pokémon you want to battle. Choose the Pokémon you want to battle. Your friend should do the same.

, Either you or your friend should battle the existing Pokémon at the gym in order to own the gym. Whoever has the stronger Pokémon out of the two of you should do this.

, Either you or your friend should do this. The idea is to “claim” the gym with a powerful Pokémon and then, either you or your friend, whoever does not claim the gym, should challenge that person in a battle afterwards.Once you are in the battle with another Pokémon, tap the screen to attack. You can dodge your enemy’s attack by swiping to the left or right.

, It may take a little bit of time for your friend (or you) to fight off the existing Pokémon in the gym. You may not be able to do this, in which case you will need to come back another day with more powerful Pokémon.

, However, you will not actually be battling your friend in real time. You will be fighting in real time, but your friend will not. Your Pokémon will benefit from this “training” in a friendly gym.


In a battle at another team’s gym, your Pokémon will faint if you lose. But in a friendly training battle, where both you and your friend are in your home gym, the battle will stop when he has 1 HP (hit point) left, so he can heal."

Know what you’re up against.,
Stock up on Ultra Balls.,
Keep it from fleeing.,
Battle it.",How to Get the Legendary Dogs on Pokémon FireRed," The Legendary Beasts only appear in the later stages of the game. You will need to defeat the Elite Four before you can find them., You will need to do this in order to get the National Pokedex. Keep in mind that they need to be 60 unique Pokemon.

, Catching 60 unique Pokémon will trigger an event at Professor Oak’s house. Go speak to him, and he will give you the National Pokedex.

, The Legendary Beasts roam the Kanto region at random, so finding them requires a lot of wandering through the grass with your fingers crossed. Using Max Repel will help you avoid endless encounters with low-level Pokémon while you do so. Make sure the first Pokémon in your party is level 49 or below, or this won’t work., This is pretty straightforward. Riding your bike rather than walking will help you find Pokémon more quickly, as you will encounter more Pokémon in a smaller amount of time. With any luck, one of them will be a Legendary Beast.

, If you finally track down a Legendary Beast and it gets away from you, don’t despair. It will now show up in the map in your Pokedex, which will make the process of finding it much quicker.The Legendary Beast’s location will change every time you fly, battle, go into a building, or change routes. This may seem like a hindrance, but you can use it to your advantage. Hop on your bike, pop a Max Repel, and start trekking through the grass. If you haven't had a hit after about 30 seconds, head into the house. When you come back out, the Legendary Beast’s area of roaming will have changed. Rinse and repeat until it appears before you.

, Only one of the three Legendary Beasts will appear in each game, and which one it is will depend on the player's choice of a starter Pokemon. The Legendary Beast in your game will always be the type that is super effective against your starter, so if you chose Squirtle it will be Raikou, if you chose Bulbasaur it will be Entei, and if you chose Charmander it will be Suicune. Plan your party accordingly.Raikou is an electric Pokemon, so ground types will be strongest against it, while water and flying types will be weak.
Entei is a fire Pokemon, so water, ground, and rock types will be strongest against it, while grass, ice, bug, and steel types will be weak.
Suicune is a water Pokemon, so grass and electric types will be strong against it, while fire, ground, and rock will be weak.

, You will need these to successfully catch a Legendary Beast. It will be difficult to catch, so pick up around 15 to be safe., The Legendary Beasts are skittish, and they will always attempt to flee rather than engaging in battle. The best strategy is to use a move like Curse, Mean Look, or Block.Sleep or Freeze will also work, but since status effect moves like those are temporary, they’re not the best strategy.
Alternatively, you can simply throw an Ultra Ball at it. Your chances are very small here, though, as the Legendary Beast will just probably escape the Pokeball and flee.

, Once you’ve found a way to keep the Legendary Beast from fleeing, the process of capturing it is the same as with any other Pokemon. Reduce its HP as much as you can without knocking it out, throw an Ultra Ball at it, and cross your fingers.


Save frequently as you go, because if you accidentally knock out the Legendary Beast, you will not have another opportunity to catch it.

Purify your Shadow Lugia using the purification chamber.,
Transfer it to Fire Red using a Gameboy to GameCube transfer cord.",How to Get Lugia in Pokémon Fire Red1," There are not a whole lot of places to find Lugia once you've missed the event needed to catch it in Fire Red. However, you can get Lugia in Gold, Silver, and Pokémon XD, though a little work is required to transfer it to Fire Red.


If you know someone who has caught Lugia in Gold or Silver, this is the easiest way to get the Pokémon and trade it over. Simply use a Gameboy transfer code and move it to your Fire Red game.
If you own a GameCube and Pokémon XD, you can trade for a special Lugia with a unique move.;
, Unless you've beaten Pokémon Silver, your only other chance to get Lugia is through Pokémon XD. To do so, you'll need some supplies, and must meet a few conditions:


Gameboy with Pokémon XD
Gameboy Advance with Pokémon FireRed.
Gameboy to Gamecube transfer cord.
Your must beat the Elite 4 and get the National Pokedex on your Fire Red game to trade from XD.You must beat Greevil in Pokémon XD.

, Lugia is much easier to catch here than in Fire Red, so make sure you nab it on your way to beating the game. Luckily, even if you knock him out, you can always come replay the level and try to catch him again.You can find Lugia during your battle with DeathGold.
You should strongly consider using your MasterBall on Shadow Lugia, as it is extremely difficult to catch without it., FireRed doesn't have information for Shadow-type moves, so you can only trade Lugia if you purge it. TO purge it, you need all nine chambers of the purification chamber to be at ""max tempo,"" meaning that each chamber has a perfect cycle of types. But there is an easy way to do this without catching a ton of different Pokemon:Go to Oasis Pokestop.
Catch 36 Hoppips at any level.
Fill all nine chambers with Hoppips
Purify Shadow Lugia in one of the tanks., To transfer, turn on both games and connect the cable. Head to the ""Basement"" in XD and to a Pokecenter in Fire Red, clicking on the computer in the right corner. You should see a ""Network"" option that allows you to trade Pokemon.

Lugia is a level 70 Pokemon. Make sure your team is strong enough to handle this.
Action Replay and Game Shark are actually the same company, they just rebranded. AR is the most modern name., The AR acts as a port between your Gameboy and the Game, changing the code as it flows from the game and allowing you to access your cheat codes.

, The title screen will appear, and then you'll be offered the chance to import your code.

, The following codes are for Lugia and two other Legendary Pokémon that can be found right next to the white bird. You might as well input them all while you're working. You can only go to the island where the birds live once all game, so if you only input Lugia's code you will never be able to get the other two.Lugia & Ho-Oh 82031CF0 0002.

Deoxys: 82031CF0 3A02 , Now check your inventory -- you should have an item called the ""Mystic Ticket."" Save your game and head off to the Seagallop Ferries.


If you turn the game off, turn the cheat code off when you turn it back on. You should still have your ticket., Once you give the ferryman your ticket, you'll have a chance to go catch your Pokemon. However, you will only have one chance at this -- once you leave Naval Island you cannot return, even with cheats. Make sure you are well prepared for the fight ahead:


Many, many Ultra Balls (30-50)
Full health.
Several Pokémon at or above level 70.

, Enter the cave and head down the tunnel. At the far end of it, on the first floor, are two staircases. The one on the right goes to Lugia, the one on the left goes to Ho-Oh., This strong Pokémon will put up a good fight, so be ready to chip away at it for a while. You catch it just like any other Pokemon, but because of its level it is especially difficult to nab. Some good hints include:


Use something to put it to sleep or paralysis the bird -- they are much easier to catch this way.
Get its health down as low as possible with moves like tackle and false swipe -- anything that doesn't do a ton of damage and might kill it before you catch it.
Even if your Ultra Ball fails, throwing one ball makes the next one even more effective, so keep chucking them."

, Once you have beat Gary, head east where you will find another staircase. Climb it to proceed.

, The third floor is the first floor where you will find wild Pokémon. Chances of encountering a Haunter on any given floor is about 1-15%; higher floors will yield better chances. You will have much more luck catching a Gastly, but the process of evolving it takes longer.


An alternative to catching a Haunter is catching a Ghastly, which can then be evolved into a Haunter by levelling up to LvL25 and using a rare candy. Keep in mind that both Ghastly and Haunter are Ghost-type Pokémon, making them immune to Normal, Fighting, and Ground attacks.
If you catch a Gastly, you will need to evolve it into a Haunter before proceeding.

Return to Valley Windworks on a Friday during the day.,
Do not set your Nintendo DS clock ahead to make Friday happen early.,
Approach Drifloon and talk to it.,
Lower Drifloon's health.,
Use your Poke Ball when Drifloon is low on health.,
Come back a week later if you accidentally knock it out.",How to Find Drifloon on Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl2," Drifloon appears in front of Valley Windworks every Friday. If you defeated Team Galactic there on a Friday, you'll have to wait until next Friday to find it.


Make sure to come during the day, as Drifloon will not appear in the morning or at night. You'll need to visit Valley Windworks between 10 AM and 8 PM., Setting your clock forward will disable any time-based events for 24 hours, including Drifloon appearing. The best you can do is set the date to Thursday and then wait 24 hours for Drifloon to appear.

, Drifloon will be visible in the overworld, much like a Legendary Pokemon. Talking to it will begin a battle with Drifloon.

, Drifloon is Level 22, so it may take a while to whittle down if you haven't leveled your Pokémon up much. Drifloon is weak to Ghost, Rock, Electric, Ice, and Dark attacks, so use these if possible to make the fight go faster., Once Drifloon's health bar is red, you can start throwing Poke Balls to try to catch it. You can use advanced balls to make it easier, but Drifloon shouldn't be difficult to catch with a regular Poke Ball.

, If you accidentally knock Drifloon out, or you miss the time that it appeared, it will show up again next Friday during the day.

Focus on having a varied team.,
Evolve your Pokémon.,
Follow a sample team.,
Train your Pokémon.",How to Get Good Pokémon in Fire Red," Throughout the game, there will be many different trainers with many different types of Pokémon. Pokémon types have many strengths and weaknesses, and knowing what these are is just the first step on getting good Pokémon! In Fire Red, the Gym Leaders and the Elite Four will focus on the following types on the list below. So, adding Pokémon that have advantages against these types will help you along your journey through the game. If you focus on one type, you will be at a big disadvantage!


Rock (Fighting, Grass, Ground, Steel, and Water types will help)
Water (Electric and Grass types help here)
Electric (Ground types help here)
Grass (Bug, Fire, Flying, Ice, and Poison types will help)
Poison (Psychic and Ground types will help)
Psychic (Bug, Dark, and Ghost types help here)
Fire (Water, Ground, and Rock types help here)
Ground (Water, Grass, and Ice types will help)
Ice (Fighting, Fire, Rock, and Steel types will help)
Fighting (Flying and Psychic types help here)
Ghost (Dark types and other Ghost types help here)
Dragon (Ice types and other Dragon types will help);
, Evolving a Pokémon makes it stronger, and might help it gain a new type as well. The most common method of evolution is leveling up the Pokémon so it gains a certain level before evolving. However, there are many different methods of evolution as well, such as:


Evolutionary Stones (Fire Stone, Water Stone, Thunder Stone, ETC.)
Evolutionary Items (doesn't have to be a stone)
Happiness Level
Having a specific Pokémon in your party
Some Pokémon have gender exclusive evolutions
Trading (unless you have a copy of Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Leaf Green, Emerald, or another copy of Fire Red, at least two Game Boy Advances, and at least one Link Cable). Training Pokémon that evolve with this method, such as Kadabra and Haunter into Alakazam and Gengar respectively, is not recommended. Trading with Fire Red is especially difficult since it was released before Pokémon introduced wireless trade without the requirement of an item to make it possible, and it is very difficult, almost impossible, to find a copy of one of these games and a Link Cable, making trades in this game almost impossible itself.

, While you don't have to use this exact team, here's an example of a good (and possible to form) team in Pokémon Fire Red. Notice how the Pokémon in this team are of various different types, and can be great Pokémon with the right training.


Venusaur: a double Grass and Poison type Pokémon, it is the Final Evolution of Bulbasaur, who is one of the three starter Pokémon at the beginning of the game)
Pidgeot: a double Normal and Flying type Pokémon, this Pokémon is the Final Evolution to Pidgey, who can be obtained in early routes of the game)
Hitmonchan: a Fighting type Pokémon, this Pokémon can be obtained as a choice when you arrive at the Saffron City Dojo, which is next to the gym)
Raichu: an Electric type Pokémon, this Pokémon evolves from Pikachu when you use a Thunder Stone on it)
Arcanine: a Fire type Pokémon exclusive to Fire Red (in Leaf Green, you can get a Ninetales as a replacement,) this Pokémon evolves from Growlithe, which can be captured on certain routes, the one connecting Lavender Town and Celadon City coming to mind)
Vaporeon: a Water type Pokémon, this Pokémon is one of the Kanto Eeveelutions (along with Flareon and Jolteon), which is obtainable using a Water Stone on Eevee, a free one can be found in a certain building in Celadon City

, Now that you have a possible plan of your final team, it's time to learn how to train them! Seeing from experience how Fire Red is one of the more difficult games in the series, it's a good idea to grind your way through to a decent level before facing your next Gym Leader or try to foil Team Rocket again. If you try to go with the flow without real training concern, you can easily end up in a tight spot. You can be the most overleveled trainer when you're around gym three, but be horribly underleveled by gym five.


Fight every trainer you see (it may not be fun seeking out every trainer in the area, but it will be worth it in the end).
Battle as many wild Pokémon as possible (unless you're in a rush, don't be afraid to challenge every single wild Pokémon you run into).
If you are able to find items that increase experience points, use them!
If there is a certain Pokémon in your party you want to level up, send them out as the lead of your party, and switch them with a stronger Pokémon in your party. Remember that this is the third generation of Pokémon, and not the sixth generation, where you can turn on and off the Experience Share, which will share experience with all of your Pokémon at once, at will.

You will need to enter a Friend Code that gives you access to the Fighting-type Friend Safari.

, The Ranch can be accessed towards the beginning of the game. It is located to the north of Route 20.

, Riolu can be found while walking through the tall grass. Riolu has a 5% chance of appearing. Riolu can be between Level 5 and Level 7.

, The only way to get Riolu in Pokémon Black & White is to beat the story first and become the Champion.

, The cave entrance is located on Route 9. You will not be able to enter the cave until after defeating the Elite Four as well as Team Plasma. Once you have fulfilled the requirements, the person blocking the entrance will allow you to pass.


The cave is dark, so you will need Flash to navigate, as well as Surf to traverse the stream.

After 30 days, Peak blocks double in value. After 40 days, Waterside blocks double in value. After 50 days, Plains triples. The cycle continues until every block has quadrupled in value.

, In order to reach the Iron Island, you will need access to Canalave City. After entering the city, walk North and cross the bridge to your left. You may have to fight your rival as you cross the bridge if you haven't already. After crossing, walk back down until you see the boats in the harbor.

, You will be presented with two staircases. Take the staircase on the right to access an elevator to take you to a lower basement. You will again see two staircases. This time take the left staircase and you will meet Riley.

, Once Riley has joined you, you need to continue through the rest of the cave, until you reach the Galactic Grunts. Defeat the Galactic Grunts and Riley will leave you. As a parting gift, he will present you with a Riolu Egg.


If you don’t have room in your party for the Egg, he will wait there until you come back with an open space.

, Keep the Egg in your party to hatch it. Eggs are hatched by taking steps in the game. Each Egg has a set number of cycles, and a cycle is complete after 256 steps. When the Egg has less than 5 cycles remaining, the Status screen will display the message: “It’s making sounds inside! It's gonna hatch soon!”


Once the Egg is hatched, a Level 1 Riolu will be born.

Use Gabite in battle against high-level Pokemon.,
Fight enemies that are weak to your attacks.,
Use Rare Candy to gain a level or two.,
Receive a traded Gabite for better leveling.,
Avoid giving Gabite an Everstone.,
Raise Gabite to Level 48.,
Consider canceling the evolution for one level.",How to Evolve Gabite," A Lucky Egg is a held item that will boost Gabite's experience gain by 50%. You have a small chance of finding Lucky Eggs on wild Chanseys, or wild Happiny in some games. Have Gabite hold the Lucky Egg while you're leveling it up., Share. This item allows Gabite to gain experience even when it's not in battle. Whenever the Pokémon that is holding the Exp. Share gains experience, Gabite will gain some as well (as long as they're both in your party)., The best way to gain experience for Gabite is to simply use it in battle as much as possible. You'll get more experience for fighting tougher enemies., If you're trying to power-level your Gabite, you'll do it most efficiently if you're fighting high-level enemies that are weak to its attacks. This will let you mow through more enemies in less time, gaining lots of experience.

Gabite has a lot of Ground moves which are highly effective against Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel Pokemon.
Gabite's Dragon moves are effective against most other types, making them powerful moves to use when leveling. Avoid fighting Steel and Fairy Pokemon, as Dragon attacks are weak or completely useless against them.

, Giving a Gabite a Rare Candy will raise it one level immediately. This can be useful for getting the last level before evolving., Gabites received via trade will gain 1.5x the regular experience, which will significantly boost your evolution speed. If you can get a Gabite from another country or language, it will gain 1.7x the normal amount of experience.You can't trade a Gabite to someone and then have them trade it back. The Gabite must have been caught on a different system.

, The Everstone will prevent Gabite from evolving when it reaches the right level. Make sure Gabite isn't holding one., Use the steps in the previous method to raise Gabite to Level 48. Once it reaches this level, it will attempt to evolve into Garchomp., You may want to prevent Gabite from evolving until after it learns Dragon Rush at level 49. It will take Garchomp until Level 55 to learn this move.To cancel an evolution, press and hold B while the Gabite is evolving. This will cancel the evolution and prevent it from turning into Garchomp.
Once the Gabite reaches Level 49, it will learn Dragon Rush and then try to evolve again. You can now let it safely evolve, as there are no more moves that Gabite will learn, and Dragon Rush is a very powerful move to have for your new Garchomp that it normally wouldn't learn for another seven levels.

Level Eevee up with high enough friendship between 8PM and 4AM to get Umbreon.,
Level up Eevee with max friendship between 4AM to 8PM to get Espeon.",How to Evolve Eevee in Pokémon Platinum," You'll be needing eight if you also want a spare, unevolved Eevee. Catching an Eevee in Pokémon Platinum is extremely difficult, but you can get your first one from Bebe in Hearthome City or in the Trophy Garden.


Breeding Eevee is the best option. Be sure to have a female Eevee or one of it's evolved forms, and another Pokémon in it's breeding group. To breed them, put two Eevee, one male and one female, in the Solaceon Daycare. Wait for a while and you will get a Pokémon egg that will hatch into an Eevee. Or, put Ditto and Eevee (any gender) in and you will get an Eevee egg.;
, Water Stones are found on Route 213 which is in the Solaceon Ruins. You can also get one on Route 230 if you have the Dowsing App on your Poketch.

, Fire Stones are found Solaceon Ruins, Fuego Ironworks (near Floroma, by surfing), and on Stark Mountain if you have the Dowsing App on your Poketch.

, Thunder Stones are found on Sunnyshore, by unearthing while underground, in Solaceon Ruins and Route 299 with the Dowsing App.

, This will take some time, so be patient. Also, make sure you are close enough to the moss rock, otherwise you might get an Espeon or Umbreon.

, Again, be close enough to the rock or you'll get another evolution. This will take more time than using one of the stones.

, Be careful that you are not close to the moss rock or the ice rock, or it will fail. Make double sure that you have enough friendship.

, Here it is the same, make sure you have enough friendship and are not close to the rocks. If you are press B while its evolving.

Know the requirements needed to evolve Mantyke.,
Head to a body of water.,
Get into battle with a Remoraid.,
Weaken the Remoraid and capture it.,
Use Mantyke in battles to gain experience points (XP) and level up.,
Use Rare Candies as an alternative.",How to Evolve Mantyke," In order for Mantyke to change to Mantine, you need to meet the only condition it needs to evolve: that is to have a Remoraid in your Pokémon party while Mantyke levels up at least once.


Remoraid is a water-type Pokémon introduced in the second generation of the game (Gold, Silver, and Crystal) and can be identified by its light-blue body, big eyes, and two large tail fins.
Remoraid can be found in any bodies of water (lakes and seas) throughout the entire game series. You can usually find it in places where you can also catch a Mantyke.;
, Preferably a lake or a sea.

, Once you get to a lake or a sea, you can either use a fishing rod (an in-game item acquired through quests) or swim in and use a Pokémon to encounter a Remoraid and battle it.

, Once you get to battle one, weaken it using any Pokémon in your party.


When it’s about to get knocked out, throw a Pokéball at it (an ordinary Pokéball will do) to catch it and include it in your party.

, Once you have a Remoraid in your party, it’s time to level up Mantyke. There is no specific kind of battle you need to do, but fighting trainers, which can be found anywhere in the game, gives off more XP compared to defeating wild Pokémon.


You can also fight fire, ground, and rock types (these types are weak against water Pokémon like Mantyke) for easy wins.

, If you don’t want to level up Mantyke through Pokémon battles, you can always use in-game items like Rare Candies.


Rare Candies allow your Pokémon to gain one level instantly without doing any Pokémon battles.
Each game only has a limited number of Rare Candies that you can get from side quests or special shops, but since Mantyke only needs to level up once to evolve, you only need one Rare Candy.

Level up Eevee.",How to Evolve Eevee in Pokémon," Eevee can change into Vaporeon, Jolteon, or Flareon if given a Water, Thunder, or Fire Stone. Giving the Eevee one of these stones will cause it to immediately evolve into the form related to that stone.


These evolutions are available in every Pokémon game, and are the only evolutions available in Blue, Red, and Yellow.;
, The locations and methods for obtaining the stones change depending on which version of Pokémon you are playing. They are arguably the easiest to find in the original games, since you just need to buy them.



Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow - The stones can be purchased at the Celadon Department Store.

Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald - You can trade Shards to the Diving Treasure Hunter for the stones. You can also find a Water Stone at the Abandoned Ship, a Thunder Stone in New Mauville, and a Fire Stone at the Fiery Path.

Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum - Stones can be found by mining in the Underground. In Platinum, they can also be found in the Solaceon Ruins.

Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2 - Stones can be found in Dust Clouds in caves, and in a variety of shopping locations depending on the version you are playing.

Pokémon X and Y - Stones can be purchased in Lumiose City from the Stone Emporium, earned through Secret Super Training, or won from defeating Inver on Route 18. You can also find Fire and Water Stones on Route 9 and Thunder Stones on Routes 10 and 11.

, Once you have the stone that you want, you will need to give it to your Eevee. The evolution will begin immediately, and in just a few moments you will have your new Vaporeon, Jolteon, or Flareon. The evolution is irreversible, and can be performed at any level.


Performing the evolution will consume the stone.

, To get either of the evolutions, your Eevee will need to have a high friendship (a.k.a. happiness) level with the trainer. The friendship level must be 220 or higher.


You can only evolve Eevee into Umbreon or Espeon in Generation 2 or later games. This is because there is no time element in the original games, or in FireRed and LeafGreen.

, Using Eevee a lot in battle and keeping it in your group will help to raise your friendship, allowing you to evolve it. You can also perform special actions to raise your friendship level quicker. Having it hold a Soothe Bell will increase the friendship bonus.


Getting your Eevee groomed will give you a large friendship bonus.
Leveling up Eevee gives it a good bonus each time.
Every 512 steps (Gen II), 256 steps (Gen III and IV), or 128 steps (Gen V and VI) will give you a small friendship boost. Note that in Generation V and VI, the chance that you will get the friendship boost is 50%.
Letting Eevee faint will decrease its friendship by 1. Using Revival Herb, Energy Root, Energy Powder, or Heal Powder will decrease friendship significantly.

, There are many NPCs scattered throughout all the games that will give you a rough estimate of this value. When you talk to them, they will say something different at different friendship levels.


Kanto (FireRed and LeafGreen) has Daisy Oak in Pallet Town. Johto has a woman in one of the houses of Goldenrod City, Hoenn has a woman in Verdanturf Town and a man in Pacifidlog Town, and Sinnoh has a woman at the Pokémon Fan Club at Hearthome, an Aroma Lady at the Pokémon Center in Eterna City, and Dr. Footstep on Route 213, as well as a Friendship Checker Pokétech app. Unova has a woman at the Pokémon fan club in Icirrus City and a woman in Nacrene City. In B&W 2, you can also call Bianca on the Xtransceiver. In Kalos, there is a woman in Santalune City and a person at the fan club in Laverre City.

, The evolution will differ depending on whether it is day or night. You can either level up during a battle or by using a Rare Candy.


Level up your Eevee during the day (4 AM to 6 PM) to evolve into Espeon.
Level up your Eevee during the night (6 PM to 4 AM) to evolve into Umbreon.

, In Generation 4 (Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum) and later you can find Moss Rocks (Leafeon) and Ice Rocks (Glaceon) at certain locations in the world. Level up your Eevee in the same area as one of these rocks to start the evolution.


The Moss and Ice Rock evolutions will supersede any other evolutions you may be eligible for, such as Umbreon or Espeon.
These Rocks are objects on the game map, and cannot be picked up or purchased. You only need to be in the same area as the Rock; it does not have to be on your screen. The Rock can be found in different locations depending on the game you are playing.

, The Moss Rock will evolve your Eevee into a Leafeon. There is one Moss Rock in each game it can be found in.



Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum - The Moss Rock is in Eterna Forest. You can trigger the evolution anywhere in this forest except at the Old Chateau.

Black, White, Black 2, and White 2 - The Moss Rock can be found in Pinwheel Forest. You can trigger the evolution anywhere in this forest.

X and Y - The Moss Rock is located on Route 20. You can trigger the evolution anywhere on this Route.

, The Ice Rock will evolve your Eevee into a Glaceon. There is one Ice Rock in each game it can be found in.



Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum - The Ice Rock can be found near Snowpoint City on Route 217. Evolving anywhere near this rock will work.

Black, White, Black 2, and White 2 - The Ice Rock is located on the bottom floor of Twist Mountain to the west of Icirrus City. You must be in the same room as the Ice Rock in order to trigger the transformation.

X and Y - The Ice Rock is located in Frost Cavern, to the north of Dendemille Town. You will need Surf in order to get to the Rock and be able to evolve your Eevee.

, In order to trigger the evolution you will need to level up Eevee. You can either level up through battle or use a Rare Candy. The evolution will happen automatically if you are near the Rock.

, In order to attain Sylveon, you’ll first need to ensure that your Eevee has learned a Fairy-type move. As you level Eevee up, you will learn Baby-Doll Eyes at Level 9 and Charm at Level 29. Eevee will need to know one of these moves before it is eligible for evolution.

, In Generation 6 (X and Y), you can play with your Pokémon, raising its Affection towards you. Raising Affection affects a variety of attributes and stats, but also allows for some special evolutions. Raising Eevee’s Affection to 2 Hearts will allow it to become Sylveon.


Affection and Friendship are unrelated stats.

, In the Pokémon-Amie minigame, feeding your Eevee Poké Puffs will raise the Affection level. The fancier the Puff, the more Affection you will gain.

, Performing the right interactions will help to raise your Affection level. You can high-five by holding your stylus in one place for a few moments. The Eevee will raise its paw, and you can make contact with it to raise the Affection.

, Once you’ve got a Fairy-type move and 2 Affection hearts, you can evolve Eevee into Sylveon. In order to trigger the evolution you will need to level up Eevee. You can either level up through battle or use a Rare Candy.


Make sure you don’t try leveling up in an area with a Moss or Ice Rock, as these will take priority and give you the wrong evolution."

SAVE BEFORE YOU FIGHT GIRATINA!,
Use Dusk Balls at first.,

Weaken it to red health and then use a sleep-inducing move like Sleep Powder, and start chucking Poké Balls.",How to Easily Catch Giratina in Pokémon Platinum Without the Master Ball," Because if you faint it, you might even have to start in the distortion world all over again.;
, Dusk Balls work the best and are probably the way you will catch Giratina if you don't use Ultra Balls. Note that Dusk Balls work only as well as regular Poké Balls when it isn't nighttime.

, Timer Balls work extremely well if you are in battle with Giratina for an extensive period of time. After 20 turns, Timer Balls match Ultra Balls; after 30, they match Dusk Balls at night; after 40, they beat Dusk Balls.

, Have A) a Pokémon that can withstand Dragon and Rock attacks (i.e. Bronzong, Lucario, Steelix) and B) a normal type (i.e. Snorlax, Clefable) to render Giratina's Ghost Type moves--Ominous Wind and Shadow Force--useless.

, In a pinch, paralysis works too, but bear in mind that it is half as effective as sleep and freezing are at facilitating the catch.

You will need to use smaller frames for guns such as regular plasma shooters and machine guns. You will use much larger handles once you’re making guns that shoot saw blades from the bottom and grenades from the top however!;
, These dictate what kind of projectiles your gun uses. Always make sure you’re using combos that make sense. You need to find your own balance between those powerful tools that rip necromorphs to pieces, and the smaller less powerful tools that will keep them at bay.


For example, it may seem like a great idea to pack two powerhouses on one gun, but that is not always the case. Two powerhouses also will mean slow shots.

, Use the tips to adjust exactly how your tool fires. There are hundreds of different ways you can make different tips and tools work together. The best way to figure it out is to experiment!


For example, you really love that pneumatic torch but wish there was a way you could make the fire come out in a smaller area with more power. Easy peasy: you would need to attach a compressor.

, You can have up to two attachments on your weapon at all times, and they alter the way your gun fires in general. You can connect a safety guard if you’re using a grenade launcher. This will prevent you from taking any splash damage if you should happen to get trigger-happy in a narrow hallway.

, It’s the last way that you can edit your gun. Most tools can hold up to 4, so 8 total for each of your guns. These have a variety of effects that alter the damage you do, your reload speed, ammo capacity and more.


The more you begin to think about it the more you realize that in Dead Space 3 your guns really are all your own. You can make them, experiment, change a few things, and try again. Before you know it you will have your ultimate weapon combo!

, This is used for one-handed weapons which prove to be most efficient. At a crafting station, simply go to ""Frame,"" and select it from the list of available frames.

, For this custom weapon a good combination of tools would be the plasma core as the top tool and the pneumatic torch as the bottom tool. They can be added at a crafting station by going to the tool section of the crafting table, scrolling through your list of tools and selecting them.

, If you choose the plasma core, go with a compact-directed ejection field. This tip will spread out your plasma shots further so that you can hit more enemies per shot. Keep the torch as is, this way if enemies get close you can burn them to a crisp over a large area. These can be added by going to the tips section on the crafting table and selecting the appropriate tip.

, The best ones for this weapon would be a damage support for your torch. This way the fire can inflict even more damage if you get into a bad situation. Also, for your plasma core you’re going to want to stick with a stasis coating. This will make it so that every time you shoot something it slows it down with stasis, allowing you to get even more shots off. These can be added and crafted from any crafting bench.

, This is used for one-handed weapons which prove to be most efficient. At a crafting station, simply go to ""Frame,"" and select it from the list of available frames.

, To make the Shootbanger, you need to set the upper tool to the military engine, and then set your lower tool to the survey charge. This can be done by going to the crafting station, and selecting the tool tips on the weapon-part crafting menu.

, You should set your top tool tip to the rail accelerator. The bottom tip is set to default in the blueprint; however, you can add your own custom tip. These can be added by going to the tips section on the weapon-crafting table and selecting the appropriate tip.

, The weapon attachments for these weapons are set to attach one as being the ammo sweeper. The second attachment would be the safety guard. These can be added and crafted from any crafting bench by going to the weapon attachments on the weapon-crafting table and selecting it.

Always be creating villagers.,
Do not ignore your military!",How to Make Your Economy Boom in Age of Empires 21," Villagers are the key to a great economy, as they gather resources and build buildings. In fact, if for any instant that you are not creating villagers from your town center, then that is valuable time wasted, especially in the Dark Age (your performance of the first two minutes of the game on any civilization can determine whether your economy is superior to other players).;
, This guide should not be used for full game-play! Success in the game is from a strong and well-developed military, but in order to do that, you need a strong economy. Beware of rushers that will invade your civilization in the Feudal Age, early Castle Age, or late Castle Age. If you neglect militaristic development (unless you are in wonder race), you will lose the game.

"
"
When the game begins, there are a few steps that must be done in very quick succession:



Immediately create 4 villagers from the town center, depleting all 200 food.,
When the 4 sheep arrive at the town center, have all but two of them place themselves right outside the town center, and two of them placed at the town center.,
Research Loom once the four villagers have all been created.,
Build a mill near the berries with one villager that is not chopping wood.,
Lure boars.,
Keep creating villagers until you get to 30 population.,
Research the Feudal Age.",How to Make Your Economy Boom in Age of Empires 22," The default hotkeys are H for town center and C to create a villager (only after selecting the town center). Thus, the fastest way to do this is to press H and then press shift-C. The shift selects 5 at a time. This pattern is perhaps the most important hotkey pattern in the game.

Have two villagers build two houses. This will temporarily increase the population to 15, allowing more villagers to be created. Do not have one villager build one house each - both villagers build one house at a time in order to keep the steady flow of villager creation. Once the two houses are completed, have the two villagers build a lumber camp near a forest (your scout should have already found at least one by now).

Select your scout and scout around what is currently visible to you. Finding the 4 initial sheep is critical in the Dark Age - the earlier they are sighted, the better. Occasionally, one of the sheep may already be visible in the fog. If this occurs, have the scout go to where the sheep is. The 4 sheep will be converted to your colors and you can continue scouting for the other 4 sheep (in pairs) that are farther away, the berries, two boars, deer (not available on some maps), gold mines, and stone mines.
Have the other villager chop wood near the town center.

, Have the newly created villagers gather food on one sheep at a time (divide the shepherds roughly in half if you run out of room, which will be inevitable). Also, deposit the wood the other villager has chopped and have him gather sheep as well.

, Loom allows villagers to survive a wolf on its own (essential at higher difficulties, as the wolves become very aggressive) and to have greater health during a boar lure. Your goal is 1:40 when you click Loom (1:45 on multiplayer due to lag).


During this time, the villagers may eventually exhaust one sheep's food. Simply select all of them and gather the one that is at the town center, not the other two right outside it. Make sure that you are keeping exactly two sheep at the town center so that the villagers do not have to walk in order to deposit.
After Loom is researched, keep creating more villagers. You may have to brute force the shepherds (selecting all of them and deposit) in order to reach the 50 food requirement. Make sure that you keep an eye out for your population reaching 13 - you'll need to build another house.

, This will satisfy the two Dark Age building requirement for the Feudal Age and will provide your civilization with a secondary, slower but steadier food source. Eventually, as more villagers are created, more can be allocated to the berries.
Once the other 4 sheep (in pairs) are found, repeat the procedure with the 4 initial sheep.

, Boar luring should be done when the sheep are almost exhausted of their food. Select one villager and attack a boar. Once the boar is running towards the villager, have him walk back to the town center. Once the boar is near the town center, have the villagers still gathering sheep (If there are any sheep left. The villagers should be idle if not.) deposit, and attack the boar.


Keep an eye out as the villager may die. There is also a risk of the boar returning to its initial location. Beware of this as time will have been wasted.
There are two boars to hunt. When the food count for the first boar reaches about 130-150, send one villager (NOT the one used for the first lure) and repeat the luring process.
When the two boars' food run out, hunt for deer. 3 villagers should hunt one deer. They are easily killed, but cannot be lured.

, Keep building houses until you can support 35 population. Some new villagers should be allocated to wood, which is very important from the Feudal Age on. You should have about 10-12 villagers on wood.


Build a mining camp next to your gold pile located near your town center. While you don't need gold to advance to the Feudal Age, it is important to start in the Dark Age (or at least while researching Feudal) because you won't be in the Feudal Age for very long. Some civilizations start out with -100 gold, and it is highly recommended to get a head-start on gold. No more than 3 villagers should be allocated to gold.
Farms are the primary source of food later on, but can be made in the Dark Age. 60 wood is the requirement, and you'll need to create some farms because your deer and berries will be exhausted of food. Farms are based on wood, and you may even need to allocate food-gathering villagers to chopping wood. Farms, ideally, should be located around the town center, as they can garrison, but if you run out of room, farms can be located around the mill.

, To wrap up, your population should be 30.

"
"
When you hit the Feudal Age, there are a few things that need to be done in very quick succession:


Select three villagers from wood and build a market.,
Get to 800 food.,
Research the Castle Age.",How to Make Your Economy Boom in Age of Empires 23,"

Select one villager from wood and build a blacksmith. This apparent asymmetry is due to the fact that the market is built much more slowly than the blacksmith. Once the market and blacksmith are finished, the 2 Feudal Age building requirement will have been completed, and the villagers should be sent back to chop wood.

Create 1 (at most 2) villagers from the town center. The created villagers should be sent to chop wood.

Do not research anything yet. The food and wood (indirectly) are critical to the Castle Age requirements. Any villagers gathering food that are not on farms (except for berries) should already be on farms by now.
Your scout should always be scouting, especially in a 1 vs 1.

, Due to the massive food gains during the Feudal Age research, 800 food should not be far off. In fact, once the market has been built, your civilization should have 800 food and 200 gold (that is your goal). If you are only creating one villager, you may have to brute force 800 food in the market.

, The Feudal Age is a ""transition"" stage - using this strategy, you don't stay in Feudal for very long at all.


During the Castle Age research, research the technologies from the mill and lumber camp.
When you do research the Castle Age, your wood supply will probably be very low. As the research goes on, 275 wood should be a goal for your villagers.
Build a mining camp next to stone. Two villagers from wood should do this task. Stone is important for town centers and for your castle later on.
Your population should be 31 or 32 during research.

"
"
As with previous ages, there are a few things that should be done in very quick succession:Select three villagers from wood and create a town center in a strategic place, preferably next to a forest and a gold or stone mine (if all three are found next to each other, then that is ideal).,
Research heavy plow.,
Build a university and castle.,
Keep expanding your civilization.,
A monastery may be built to create monks.,
Trade carts are an excellent way to get gold if you are playing with at least 1 ally.,
Research the Imperial Age.",How to Make Your Economy Boom in Age of Empires 24," If you do not have enough wood, make sure you stock up 275 wood, and then build the town center. Building more town centers is extremely important to your civilization as you can create more villagers using both town centers. Town centers, along with the 275 wood, also cost 100 stone. If you need to, trade resources in the market. In the Castle Age, you'll want to build 2 to 3 more town centers for optimal growth.



Create more villagers from your town center. In order to continue with the steady flow of villager creation, you'll need to remember to frequently build houses with your lumberjacks. New villagers should be allocated evenly to food, wood, and gold, but it is important to have about 8 villagers on stone.

, This costs 125 food and wood, so you may have to wait a while before researching. Additionally, as you get more wood, you'll want to reseed farms using the queue in the mill.
There are other technologies that can be researched. Examples include Bow Saw, Gold Mining, and Wheelbarrow. Remember when you are researching Wheelbarrow, it is common sense to make sure the other town center(s) keep on creating more villagers.

, Universities have useful technologies, both related to the economy and military. When you have 650 stone, build a castle using four villagers from stone mining. If 650 stone is too far out, especially if you are getting rushed, a monastery may be built (or a castle age military building), fulfilling the two Castle Age buildings requirement.

,
Keep building more farms with your newly created villagers. Reseeding is important, as manually reseeding is annoying and, when you're micromanaging your military during rushes or simply all-out attacks, very frustrating. The town centers being created should prevent you from having to build another mill.


Unlike the mills, more lumber camps should be built. This is especially important in the castle age, as rushers will target lumberjacks that are normally found outside the town center vicinity (when you garrison, the lumberjacks will not head to the town center). Lumber camps should also be built because forests will be cut down, and new lumber camps will decrease the walking time that is gradually being increased.

Villagers should be allocated to mining gold. Thus, more mining camps should be built. If you are not steadily allocating villagers to mine gold, then the 800 gold requirement suddenly becomes a much harder target. The allocation to mining gold is especially important in the Castle Age because that is when you should be developing your military. Most military units will cost gold (for some civilizations, it is even more critical as their militaries are expensive). Mining stone is a much lesser priority as stone is primarily only used for towers, town centers, castles, walls, and Murder Holes.

, The relics, which can only be picked up by monks, provides a constant stream of gold to your economy and is an excellent source of gold when there is a lack of it (and when trading in the market becomes very inefficient).

, The farther away their market is away from yours, the more gold the cart gets per round trip. Additionally, researching Caravan doubles the speed of the carts. Beware that these carts are highly vulnerable to attack by cavalry units.


The population will vary once you research the Imperial Age. As the game continues, more and more of your resources will be used for military units, upgrades, and technologies, and less on the economics. Keep in mind that your population should still be increasing during Imperial research.

, The time when you click the research button will vary. Assuming you are not rushing and building a military (which you should be doing, except in the wonder race mode), your goal is 25:00. Ideally, you'll want to use your very first town center to research as the land around it will have been developed. During the Imperial Age research, you can research Handcart from another town center (Wheelbarrow is prerequisite).


Often times, you will ignore your population limit. One villager should frequently be building houses as the game progresses (not necessarily the same villager, however).

Support Anora for the throne.,
Propose marriage.,
Choose the right options during the Landsmeet.,
Don’t die.,
Aim for a great epilogue.",How to Marry Anora in Dragon Age: Origins," You cannot marry Anora and take the throne with her if you support Alistair instead, so,when choosing who to put forth as candidate, make sure that you choose Anora.


This will happen during a dialogue with Anora in Arl Eamon’s estate. Once you have rescued her from Arl Howe, talk to her by right-clicking on her. She will ask that you support her for the throne. Agree by choosing the dialogue option that says you will do so.;
, Make sure to fully explore all of the various dialogue options with Anora when talking to her in Eamon’s estate. There will be an option to tell Anora that you wish to marry her. She will be surprised, but agree that it could be a very advantageous move.


This step is very important. If you miss this step, you will not be able to marry Anora. It sets up the marriage and the proper Landsmeet outcome. From here, it is about choosing the right options so that you don’t break the agreement with Anora.

, During the Landsmeet, it is possible to either have Loghain killed or spare him. It is also possible to exile Alistair. There are a few different combinations that will allow your marriage with Anora to proceed, and a few that you’ll need to avoid.


In order to marry Anora, you must not kill Loghain. If you want Loghain to die, then Alistair will have to be the one who duels Loghain. Alistair will then kill Loghian during the duel, and Alistair’s life will be spared.

However, if Alistair is hardened, he will choose to take the throne. Thus, the only way to marry Anora and have Loghain die, is for an unhardened Alistair to kill Loghain.


Other options that will allow you to marry Anora are to spare Loghain and have Alistair killed, or to spare Loghain and persuade Anora to spare Alistair (although Alistair can be spared, he will be enraged that you’ve spared Loghain and will leave your party).
These are all dialogue options that are capable of being selected during the Landsmeet. They become relevant when you reach the point of choosing who to duel Loghain.

If Alistair duels Loghain, he will kill Loghain during the duel.
If you choose to have your Grey Warden duel Loghain, then you will have the option, upon defeating him, of either executing him (preventing your marriage to Anora) or sparing him (guaranteeing the safety of your marriage to Anora).


Just read the dialogue choices carefully, and make sure that you choose a combination that will not cause your marriage to fall through.

, The Grey Warden and Anora won’t be married until after the game is completed. Therefore, your Grey Warden must survive the end of the game in order to actually marry Anora.


This means that you must either accept Morrigan’s proposition prior to the final battle, or have Alistair fight the Arch demon at the end.
If the Grey Warden dies, Anora will assume the throne by herself.

, If you have done everything right, then the epilogue will note how you and Anora married and rule together.


It’s nice to be king, and remember, the major restriction to marrying Anora is that you are playing as a male human noble. Any other origin will be deemed unsuitable for a political marriage.

Get Experience Crystals.,
Feed your Eidolons with Experience Crystals.,
Feed Eidolons with Crest Stats.,
Stop feeding Crests when you’ve reached the cap.,
Equip your Eidolon with accessories.,
Evolve your Eidolon.",How to Make Eidolon Stronger in Aura Kingdom," These crystals can be obtained through hunting open-world monsters, opening daily quest rewards, and also through Eidolon interaction.


Most players use Eidolon Dialogue since it's more convenient than hunting in open world.;
, To feed Eidolons, simply click on the Eidolon button found below the screen, click on your Eidolon, and then choose an Experience Crystal in the list. Each Experience Crystal has different sizes that gives different amounts of experience points:


Crystal Experience Dust gives 1,315 EXP but has a level 25 cap.
Medium Experience Crystal gives 1,000 EXP but has level 50 cap.
Large Experience Crystal gives 15,000 EXP.
Pure Experience Crystal gives 20,000 EXP.

, Unlike players where you get to distribute your free stats, Eidolons have to be fed with certain Crest to increase specific stats. Crest stats are useful in strengthening your Eidolon, and each Eidolon has their own main stat base.


Crest of Flame will give DMG 3–6 if fed to Eidolon
Crest of Ice gives DEF 1–3
Crest of Wind gives SPD 1–3
Crest of Thunder gives CRIT 1–3
Symbol of Sand gives HP 5–10
Symbol of Forest gives EVA 1–3
Symbol of Darkness gives DMG 1–4, CRIT 1–2
Symbol of Light gives HP 2–6, DEF 1–2
Note that Crests are consumable items and cannot be reused.

, Eidolon have stat caps as well, like everybody else, so make sure to know the max stat to avoid wasting Crests.


DMG (750)
CRIT (250)
SPD (250)
HP (1250)
DEF (250)
EVA (250).

, Yes, you can equip your Eidolon with accessories, which gives them decent stats. Each Eidolon can equip up to two accessories.


Accessories can be crafted after purchasing the recipes from the blacksmith in Navea City. These accessories will take time to be completed since it requires you to gather materials.
You can see the list of materials needed in your recipe. Some can be obtained through mine (such as Alloy) while others are dropped from the dungeon monsters.
Level 50 Eidolon accessories requires small experience crystal as well.
If you have gold to spare, you can buy these materials through the Auctioneer.

, Eidolons can evolve to their next stage, which increases all the stats to a higher grade. Eidolons much reach level 40 to evolve, and the owner must have certain materials.


Most Eidolons need a small Experience Crystal, Key of Gaia, and a certain crest. You can check this through your Eidolon Info tab and then choose Evolution.
The more you evolve your Eidolon, the stronger they get.

From now on, the military will dominate gameplay.",How to Make Your Economy Boom in Age of Empires 25," As such, you should continue to research new military technologies, upgrade units, and to create more units for a well-equipped army. There are a few things that should be done for your civilization, however:


As with previous ages, keep creating villagers! The ideal civilization contains around 100 villagers. Against hardest AIs and human opponents, do not cease villager creation, as villagers will die from attacks and raids. Allocate villagers according to your resources - if you have, for example, 7000 wood and only 400 food, it would be a good idea to use some lumberjacks and create more farms, as well as reseed in the queue. Wood on land maps generally becomes less important than food and gold in the Imperial Age.
Research Crop Rotation, Two-man Saw, and Gold Shaft Mining. Stone Shaft Mining is optional, but not a necessity, and resources can be better spent on your military. Treadmill Crane is also a useful technology that is found at the university.

Reach out to video game companies and offer to review games.",How to Make Money Playing Video Games1," Whether you are creating a blog or using YouTube, you need to have an attention-grabbing moniker. This can be something simple, such as your given name and “video game reviews” after your name, or you can build a brand from the ground up, creating an entirely new name, website graphics, and even a theme song or jingle.
, You can use YouTube or start a blog to create an online presence, but having some sort of venue online with which to provide your review is essential. If you start a YouTube channel, make sure you have a decent video camera and a place to set up.Some people make great money via YouTube, and have even gone so far as to make it their full-time job. This is rare, and can take years of hard work, so don’t expect a quick payout.

, Start reviewing new games; most people will not be interested in older ones. When a new game comes out, you can either buy it or rent it, though buying it will make making a profit difficult. When you review, touch on what makes the game great, what it is lacking in, and what type of audience it is best suited for.Know your audience. If you are targeting videogame players directly, speak or write as though you are talking to players. If you are targeting parents of videogame players, use language that explains games clearly to a novice.

, Encourage them to share with others if they like what they see. The best way to build your business is to get your name out there. Even if you feel embarrassed or silly, tell your family and friends what you are doing, and ask them to please share your website or channel if they like what they see. This is a simple, easy way to garner more interest in your site., In social media, hashtags are quite useful in linking your name to the names of others who are doing similar work. Whether you are using Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter to talk about your new venture, make sure you are using hashtags., Although you might hope for sponsorships in the future, these programs are a great way to start out making a little bit of cash., Once you have established your presence online (think at least a few hundred followers and 6 months of consistent posting), reach out to various video game companies and offer your services as a reviewer. While you might not hear back from large-scale companies, smaller or up-and-coming companies may be just as eager to get their name out as you are.

When reaching out to companies, use formal language, and always be polite. Give them links to your site or channel, and explain how many pageviews or video views you receive on a monthly basis. These numbers are important in determining how effective you would be as a means of advertisement.

If you do not want to record, you can take pictures to illustrate your points and give visual learners a better means of understanding., Use social media to promote your online presence. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are all great ways to promote yourself. Use hashtags and regular posting habits to keep your name and brand relevant. If you have friends who are active in online gaming or tutorial sites, ask them to share your information, as well. , If you choose to go the route of a site versus a YouTube or Vimeo channel, make use of Google AdSense, a program that uses your online space to advertise with predetermined companies. Typically, AdSense shows up as ads in the sidebar, or ads across the bottom of the webpage that can then be clicked out of.

Use discretion when choosing online ads for your site. Although most people do not mind a few ads, being overwhelmed by ads on both sidebars, as well as pop-ups and mid-text ads may discourage viewers from visiting your site in the future. If your site seems cluttered or difficult to read, scale down on your ads.

If you played the game once, but are largely unfamiliar with all of its levels, this is not a great game to play competitively. Instead, seek out tournaments that take advantage of games you are extremely familiar with., Many tournaments will have different levels to enter. If this is the case, be realistic with your own skill level and accurately identify whether you are an amateur, possess mid-level skills, or are practically a professional in your ability to maneuver through the game in question. If you are a lower-level user, but want to improve, spend a few weeks working on the game., If you are entirely new to the world of video game tournaments, start out in small ones, with lower payouts. Once you have gotten your feet wet and become familiar with how they work, you can move on to larger tournaments with higher payouts and more competition., Some tournaments will require an entrance fee, while others will require travel. If you cannot afford to travel, or you cannot afford the entrance fee, resist the temptation to enter, anyway. Although you would certainly make your money back if you won, if you do not win, you are out money you could not spare in the first place., Tournaments range widely in terms of payout. Some tournaments do not pay at all, some pay in merchandise, some pay as little as $10, and some pay as much as several thousand dollars. Do your research before entering a tournament and don’t discount those that only provide merchandise as a reward; this merchandise can then be sold for profit and may make you even more than if you’d entered a cash-paying tournament."

Fill in the defensive cards.,
Decide on cycle or utility cards.,
Add a building.,
Put at least one spell in your deck.",How to Make a Powerful Deck in Clash Royale," This will be the card that does the most damage to the opponent's towers. You will build a deck around this win condition. It should be high-enough level to be strong in your current arena.

Some win conditions are: Hog Rider, P.E.K.K.A., Royal Giant, Balloon, X-Bow, Miner, Golem, Rocket, and Three Musketeers. There are much more possible win conditions.;
, The archetypes are beatdown, siege, control, cycle, spell bait, and hybrid. They each have their own strengths and weaknesses.

Beatdown focuses on creating a huge push that the opponent can't stop. This method has a heavy tank with high damaging units behind it. Beatdown is weak to control decks. To counter it, never let your opponent build up that push in the first place. Continually pressure their towers and don't let them build up elixir.
Siege archetypes have a building as their win condition: either Mortar or X-Bow. It is a rare deck archetype and its goal is to defend their building to do damage on the towers. This archetype is weak to huge beatdown pushes but is strong against control.
The control type decks are the most diverse. Cycle is a type of control where the deck is very cheap and quickly cycles their win condition faster than the opponent's counters. Otherwise, these decks chip away at the other towers, doing damage over time. Any amount of damage matters.
Spell bait isn't really an archetype. They can be beatdown, control, or hybrid. These cards are all usually countered by the same spell. If you get your opponent to use that spell, you can attack and leave him with no good way to stop you. Skeleton army, Princess, Goblin Gang, and Goblin Barrel are common in these decks.
Hybrid decks are the most powerful and the most difficult to create. They combine two archetypes and two win conditions for a deck that is hard to defend against. A hybrid deck might have an X-Bow and a Giant in the deck.

, The most effective decks are 3.5-4.5 in average elixir cost.(AEC) There are good decks higher or lower than that. Cheaper decks are faster but have less tank-oriented troops. Heavy decks have a slow play style and are usually beatdown.

If you have an average elixir cost of 4.0 or above, you might want to consider having the elixir collector in your deck. This card will collect more elixir for you and allow you to play troops faster.

, Do you want a fast deck continually attacking the opponent? Do you want a slow deck that builds up momentum? Or do you want a balance of the two. It is up to you.

Troops have different movement speeds. Fast decks might want speedy hog riders, elite barbarians, or goblins. A slow deck could include the mighty Golem or executioner.

, Get troops that attack air, do splash damage, deal heavy single target damage, and troops that do more than one at a time. You will need one of each in your deck to make it effective.

Musketeer, Minions, Mini Pekka, and some more do single target damage.
Wizard, Witch, Bowler, and Ice Golem have splash attacks.

, These cards compliment your win-condition and help defeat its counters. You should try to play these with your win condition. They need support to be effective and are usually glass cannons.

For example, Wizard is good with P.E.K.K.A. because it is good at removing swarms which the P.E.K.K.A. is weak to.
Some support cards are Valkyrie, Musketeer, Witch, and Electro Wizard.

, These are generally slow moving cards good for protecting your towers. Some are swarms of low health cards that do a lot of damage.

These include Ice Wizard, Barbarians, Minion Horde, and Skeleton Army.

, These can be used whenever you need to. Cycle cards are cheap and cycle your deck for a better card to use. Utility cards can be used to counter almost any card and are usually cheap. Both of these help you make positive elixir trades, or when you spend less elixir to counter a troop than it cost for your opponent to deploy it. This allows you to have more elixir than your opponent.

Cycle cards include Ice Spirit and Skeletons.
Some utility cards are Spear Goblins, Minions, and Fire Spirits.

, These are also part of your defense, Some buildings spawn troops periodically. Others do damage against enemy troops. Most decks will have one of these in them.

The inferno tower does damage that increases over time. It will do heavy work against all tanks.
The cannon is cheap (3 elixir), so your can use it to kill Hog Riders and defend small pushes. The Tesla is like a cannon that targets air.
Bomb tower deals splash damage.
Barracks spawn barbarians, Goblin Hut spawns Spear Goblins, Furnace hatches Fire Spirits, and Tombstone raises Skeletons.

, These offer direct damage and are incredibly useful. They all are different.

Zap is cheap and stuns troops. Log knocks back cards and deals splash. Lightning deals high damage against the 3 highest health units. Rocket does the most damage to a small area. Arrows pepper a large area and Fireball is a lighter Rocker.
Other spells affect troops. Heal spell, well, heals your troops. Rage increases movement speed and attack speed. Freeze freezes troops in place.

Get slow or melee weapons.,
Go for body shots.,
Always collect stars.,
Avoid multiple kill weapons.,
Die on purpose.,
Always collect ammo.",How to Make Money on Puppet Wars," This may sound weird but slower kills means more time to go to the star. Good things include mops, katanas, hand-guns,and nose-pinchers.;
, If you just can't get a slow gun and don't like melee, then getting body shots is your next best option. These take multiple shots to kill with and you have more time to get there.

, No matter how far away always collect them. These are the only way of getting money period. Nothing else gives you money in the game.

, This makes it harder to get all the stars in time before they shrink. Examples of things you should use are: Rpg's, Grenades, Katanas, any rapid firing gun.

, This will allow you to keep killing puppets, thus giving you more chances to make money. This is best done on levels with 100 puppets and when you've killed about 90. You don't lose any weapons or money however.

, This will get you more ammo to kill puppets with. It is a green box with what appears to be a bullet and a yellow circle around it.

Download and install a Nintendo DS emulator.,
Download a HeartGold or SoulSilver ROM (game backup) on your Windows computer.,
Extract the ROM.,
Download the Sacred Gold and Heart Silver files.,
Extract the ""2sg2ss4105.zip"" file.,
Open the 2sg2ss4105 folder and then open ""Patches"".,
Run ""xDelta GUI.exe"".,
Click .Select Patch.,
Load the patch.,
Click .Select ROM.,
Click .Apply patch.,
Copy the patched file to your device (if necessary).,
Start your emulator and load your patched ROM.,
Get ready for a challenge!",How to Play Pokémon Sacred Gold and Storm Silver," Since Sacred Gold and Storm Silver are fan-made mods of HeartGold and SoulSilver, they can only be played through a Nintendo DS emulator. You can install an emulator on your computer, or you can install it on your Android or jailbroken iOS device. There are several emulators available depending on the operating system and device you are using. Regardless of what you install your emulator on, you'll still need to use a Windows computer to build the game file.


Windows and Mac - The two most popular Nintendo DS emulators are DeSmuME (Windows and Mac) and NO$GBA (Windows only). You can download DeSmuME from desmume.org/download/, and NO$GBA from problemkaputt.de/gba.htm.
Android - There are several DS emulators available for Android, including DraStic, nds4droid, and Open NDS Emulator. All of these are available on the Google Play Store.
iOS - You'll need a jailbroken device in order to download and install nds4ios, which is a port of DeSmuME. Jailbreaking your device will void your warranty and can cause problems with stability. If your device is jailbroken, you can get nds4ios from the cydia.myrepospace.com/Gamer6401/ repository in Cydia.;
, You'll need the US version of HeartGold to play Sacred Gold or the US version of SoulSilver to play Storm Silver. You can find ROM files by searching ""HeartGold/SoulSilver rom"" using your favorite search engine. Make sure that you download the US ""(U)"" edition. The ROM file will download in RAR or ZIP format.


Both Sacred Gold and Storm Silver allow you to get all 493 Pokémon without trading. This means that there's no real difference between using HeartGold or SoulSilver, outside of a few small encounters.
In many regions, it is illegal to download a ROM file for a game that you don't own.
This process must be done on a Windows computer, as the patching tool was designed for Windows.

, You'll need to extract the NDS file out of the RAR or ZIP file that you downloaded. If it is a ZIP file, you can simply double-click it and then drag the NDS file out of the archive. If it is a RAR file, you'll need to install a program that can open RAR files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. Once you've installed one of these free programs, double-click the RAR file and extract the NDS file inside.

, These files are fan-made, and need to be downloaded from the forum thread that the creator made. You can find the thread here. Click the ""Patches and Documentation"" link at the bottom of the post. Select the ""Mediafire"" link, as Rapidshare no longer works.


Follow the link to download the ZIP file. It should be named ""2sg2ss4105.zip"".

, Double-click this downloaded file and select ""Extract All"". This will create a new folder will all of the 2sg2ss4105 files inside.

, This folder contains the tools you need to create the modified ROM file.

, Allow the program to run if your operating system warns you about unknown programs. If you are prompted to install the .NET Framework, follow the prompts to download and install it.

, This will open a window allowing you to navigate to the patch you want to use. Open either the Classic Version folder or the Complete Version folder to find the patch file.


The Classic Version contains the new adventure, but does not modify the stats, movesets, or other data for any of the Pokémon. Choose this if you want a new adventure with familiar Pokémon.
The Complete Version makes many changes to various attributes of almost all of the Pokémon. Choose this if you want to be surprised as to how your Pokémon grow and evolve.

, Select the patch for the version of the game you are modifying. Open it to return to the patcher window.

, Browse for the NDS file that you extracted from the ROM you downloaded. Make sure it's the same version of the game (HeartGold or SoulSilver) as the patch you selected.

, The change will be made instantly. A copy of the file will be made with ""_patched"" at the end of the name. The copy will be located in the same location as the original NDS file.

, If you're planning on playing the game on your smartphone or on a Mac, you'll need to transfer the file to that device. If you're moving it to a Mac, you can just put it on a USB drive and copy it that way. If you need to get it on your Android, you can connect it to the computer via USB and copy it directly onto the device. You can also load it into a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox. This is the best way to transfer it to a jailbroken iOS device.

, Load up your emulator and open the ROM file. The process for opening a ROM file varies, but generally you can open one from the File menu or the main menu of the emulator app. You'll be able to tell that you're running the patched version when Professor Oak greets you at the start of the game. The opening text will inform you that you're playing a Sacred Gold or Storm Silver hack.

, The creator of these hacks has upped the difficulty of the original games by a fair amount. All Gym Leaders and other big boss trainers use six Pokémon during battle, which means you'll need a large team from the start. Because all Pokémon through Generation IV can be found, you'll be battling a much wider range of Pokémon than you would in the originals as well. Take full advantage of the massive number of Pokémon available to create the ultimate team.

Choose your starter Pokémon.,
Create a good defense for your starter.,
Catch Pokémon that have a type advantage over the Elite Four.,
Use all six Pokémon team slots wisely - you can't take more than six with you.",How to Make a Good Team in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver," A starter Pokémon is the very base of an effective team. There are three for HeartGold and SoulSilver:


Choose Chikorita, the Grass-type, if you want your starter to deal primarily with the Defense stats and status conditions. This Pokémon is excellent for setting up Reflects and Light Screens, and also learns a few powerful moves at later levels.
Choose Cyndaquil, the Fire-type, if you want a starter with powerful Special Attack. This Pokémon's offensive movepool, coupled with its stats, can often make it effective enough to be the lead.
Choose Totodile, the Water-type, if you want the starter to have an excellent Attack stat. While the number of Special Attack moves in its movepool can be a bit of a hindrance, this Pokémon is often seen as the most powerful of the three starters stat-wise.;
, It's good that you cover your starter with the type that can beat the type that your starter is weak to.


To protect Chikorita, a variety of different Pokémon can be used on account of its many type weaknesses. It is recommended to use Fire-types like Growlithe or Vulpix to protect it from Bug and Ice, or Ground-types like Sandshrew to combat Fire and Poison.
To protect Cyndaquil, employ a Water-type like Wooper or Psyduck in order to defend it from Rock- and Ground-type attacks. An Electric- or Grass-type may also be effective for its Water-type weakness, so Mareep and Bellsprout are viable options.
To protect Totodile, use Ground-type Pokémon to defend it from Electric attacks, or Fire-type Pokémon to defend it from Grass attacks.

, A Psychic-, Dark-, Fighting-, and Ice-type lineup, for example, can be used to beat the Elite Four and the Champion easily.

, Make sure you have some dual types!

Identify Dunsparce’s strengths and weaknesses by knowing its Pokémon type.,
Increase Dunsparce’s level.,
Use in-game items to level Dunsparce.,
Allow Dunsparce to learn new moves.",How to Use Dunsparce Effectively," Dunsparce is a Normal-type Pokémon; this means that it generally takes normal amount of damage from all types of Pokémon, except from Fighting-types where it receives twice the damage.


When Dunsparce gets attacked by a Ghost-type Pokémon, it receives no damage, but it can’t also deal any damage to Ghost-type Pokémon.
Generally, Dunsparce deals normal damage to all Pokémon types. In short, to effectively use Dunsparce in battles, avoid pitting it against Fighting and Ghost-types.;
, You can easily gain experience points (XP) once you learn how to effectively use Dunsparce’s type against opponents.


Facing Pokémon types that Dunsparce is stronger against will allow you to earn quick wins. At the same time, avoiding Fighting-type Pokémon will help you conserve its HP to lessen your trips to Pokémon Centers.

, If you don’t want to fight battles to gain XP, you can use items to increase Dunsparce’s level. Items like Rare Candies instantly increase a Pokémon’s level by one point.


Rare Candies are food items that can be bought from shops or from non-playable characters (NPC).

, As it levels up, Dunsparce will naturally learn new moves and skills, which can be quite cool and powerful.


Skills such as Ancient Power (automatically learn at level 19) and Take Down (learn at level 22) are pretty strong attacks that deal heavy damage to all types of Pokémon (except for Ghost-types, as mentioned).
Just be patient, and Dunsparce can become a great asset to your Pokémon party even though it doesn’t evolve into a more powerful Pokémon.

, Change the name of your Sneasel to “XXXXCELEBI”, where four X’s represent any four letters. The game will automatically delete the four letters later on.

,,, The game will prompt you to save before you can switch boxes.

, The screen should read “Saving… Don’t turn off the power.” Once it has completely shut down, turn the game back on.


Because you are turning off the power when the game is trying to save, it is crucial that you save your game earlier on, just in case something goes wrong.

,, If you’re lucky, you’ll have created a “bad” clone in the process of making several clones. If not, keep repeating the cloning process while experimenting with the power switch; turning the power off a little earlier or later can be the difference between a good and bad clone. A bad clone is identified by all of the following traits:


The clone’s name will either be a question mark (?) or missing entirely.
The clone’s level is 0.
The clone’s gender will be different from the original Sneasel and the good clones.

,,, Its name should now look like “???????????????????”.

,, This will back your bad clone back into the second slot.


A “sacrifice” Pokémon is one that you are willing to give up. It will be deleted in later steps.

, Don’t take it back just yet.

, Close the PC again.

,, Its name has changed, and your Sneasel has now become a Celebi!

Have a team of Pokémon leveled up to around level 60 (preferably higher).,
The first Elite Four is Lorelei.,
After you fight Lorelei, the next Elite Four is Bruno.,
After Bruno, it's Agatha.,
After Agatha is Lance.,
Once you beat Lance, it's time to fight Champion Blue/Kaz/Gary/YOURRIVALSNAMEHERE.,
Victory!",How to Defeat the Elite Four in Pokémon FireRed or LeafGreen," A good team is 1 each of Water, Fire, Electric, Ghost or Bug, and Ice types (each will be explained when they are useful in the individual Elite Four members' details section). If you take this route, you should aim for at least level 65 just to be safe, and you can use one of your extra party slots (you will have 1-3, depending on whether you use a water/ice dual-type and include the bug/ghost) to put a lower-leveled Pokémon that you want to train up and give it the Exp Share. It will be easier if you have a full team consisting of all of the above plus a strong defender (Dragon types (of which you can only get Dratini and its evolutions before beating the Elite Four) work best since their only weaknesses are Ice and Dragon type moves, while they resist Fire, Water, Electric, and Grass).;
, Lorelei uses Ice types, but don't think about using Fire moves here, since all of them except for Jynx are water/ice dual type (meaning fire will have regular effectiveness). Instead, shock all of her Pokémon with electricity, and use Shadow Ball or Fire Punch on her Jynx.

, Bruno utilizes Fighting types, with 2 Onixes to cover his weakness to Flying types. Make sure you either use a very strong Flying type here, or use Psychic types to smash down his Pokémon. Use Surf on his Onixes, and you should be fine. The reason you should use Flying over Psychic moves is the fact that his Pokémon all have high attack stats - and Psychic Pokémon have low defense stats. Slowbro is really strong here since not only does it have higher than average defense stats (compared to other Psychic types), but its water typing gives it an edge against Bruno's 2 Onixes.

, Agatha uses Poison types (with most of them being Ghost type as well), so your Psychic Pokémon will destroy all of these with a single Psychic attack, and you can electrocute her Golbat if you want to (but it's unnecessary). Well leveled teams shouldn't have any trouble here.

, Lance is the master of Dragon types. Make sure to lead off with your Electric type to hopefully OHKO his Gyarados (dual Water/Flying type means Electric type moves will be 4x effective). Once he's down, switch to your Ice type Pokémon, and his team will have a hard time. However, his Aerodactyl and Dragonite will possibly kill your Ice type if you're not using Articuno. If this happens, switch to your defender and either try to outlast them (which will be relatively easy if said defender does decent damage) or use a Revive and whatever potion on your Ice type, and switch it back in as soon as you can.

, This is a tough battle, since he doesn't stick to one type of Pokémon. The best thing to do is just switch out to whatever kills his next Pokémon. Ice moves will take out Venusaur, Exeggutor, Pidgeot, and Rhydon, Electric is good against Charizard, Gyarados, Blastoise, and Pidgeot. Water is useful against Arcanine, Rhydon, and Charizard, Fire will take out Exeggcutor/Venusaur, and use your Bug/Ghost (if you brought one; if not, just go with whatever you have that does the best damage and isn't fighting or poison-type, and doesn't mainly use psychic-type moves) against his Alakazam.

, You've defeated the Pokémon League!

You'll need 30+ Ultra Balls. Reset to your save point if you accidentally faint him or run out of Pokeballs.
The only attacking move Zapdos knows is Drill Peck. This means he is easier to catch if you bring a Pokémon who resists Flying attacks. Geodude, Graveler or Golem are perfect for this as they're Rock type, have high defense, and are immune to Thunder Wave. Give them Leftovers and have them use Defense Curl a few times, if you like.
Bring Zapdos' health down to the red and apply a status condition such as sleep or paralyze before attempting to catch him. Sleep and freeze are most effective, but are difficult to use because they're not permanent. A Thunder Wave user will usually do the trick.

Find Articuno in the Seafoam Islands.,
Be prepared.,
Consider bringing a Seel or Dewgong in your party.,
Catch Articuno.",How to Catch the Three Legendary Birds in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen1," Articuno is the ice-type legendary bird. It is the most powerful of the three birds. Fly to Fuchsia City and surf down Route 19, then surf left down Route 20 to the Seafoam Islands. Enter the island. You will need to navigate through a maze of ice and rapids to get to Articuno.You will need Pokémon with Strength and Surf to reach Articuno. There is a complicated rock-moving puzzle along the way!;
, Bring a few repels to keep wild Pokémon away. Make sure that you have at least 30 Ultra Balls – Articuno may be the weakest of the three birds, but it is still a very strong Pokémon. If you run out of Ultra Balls in the midst of the battle, then you might not be able to catch Articuno!


Save before the battle. Once you find Articuno, make sure that you save before you try to catch it. This way, you can try again if you mess up.

, Seel and Dewgong take 1/8 damage from ice moves, and Ice Beam is Articuno's only attacking move. Try to catch a Seel in the cave on your way to Articuno.


Give the Seel or Dewgong the Leftovers item to make the battle even easier. When held by a Pokémon, Leftovers make that Pokémon gradually recover HP throughout a battle. Find Leftovers on Routes 12 and 16, hidden underneath where the Snorlaxes were sleeping., The most successful way to catch this bird is to get its health into the red, then give it a status condition. Freeze and Sleep are best. However, Paralyze may be the easiest since it doesn't wear off. Keep throwing Ultra Balls until you get it – and make sure not to injure the bird so much that it faints before you can catch it!


Avoid status conditions like Poison and Burn that gradually injure the afflicted Pokémon. These are risky: you'll run the chance of killing the Articuno before you can catch it.

Catch Zapdos.",How to Catch the Three Legendary Birds in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen2," Zapdos is the second hardest bird to catch, but it is not that easy to get to.Once you obtain the HM Surf from the Safari Zone, fly to the Rock Tunnel entrance and walk up to the grass patch, get through the open fence and surf down the river to the Power Plant. Enter the Power Plant, and proceed counterclockwise through the building to reach Zapdos.


You'll know you've found Zapdos when you see a bird Pokémon standing in your path, outside of the battle screen.

, Be sure to buy at least 35 Ultra Balls – and consider using the Master Ball, if you want Zapdos more than anything. Bring a couple of repels with you to ease your way through the Power Plant – you'll encounter a lot of strong electric-type Pokémon.

, This is the only attacking move that Zapdos uses, so a resistant Pokémon on your team will make the fight much easier. Geodude and Graveler are perfect for this: they resist all Flying moves, they have high defenses, and they are immune to Thunder Wave. Avoid using this Pokémon as you wind your way through the Power Plant – save it for Zapdos!


Give your Pokémon Leftovers to hold so that they heal throughout the battle.
Have Geodude or Graveler use Defense Curl several times. This will boost its defense even more.

, This fight will be a struggle, but you can do it! Once you find the legendary bird, make sure to save before you engage it. In the fight, bring the bird's health into red, then inflict it with a weakening status condition like Sleep, Paralyze, or Freeze. Once the bird is weak, keep throwing Ultra Balls until you catch it!

, Make sure that you have at least 30 Ultra Balls. Also, bring a couple of Max Repels – the way to Moltres is long, and there are a lot of strong Pokémon there.

, This makes your Pokémon immune to Moltres' only two attacking moves. It will make the battle much easier – Moltres won't be able to hurt you at all!Vulpix has Flash Fire, as does Ponyta. You can catch a Ponyta right outside of Mt. Ember, where Moltres is found. It will take zero damage from Moltres for the duration of the fight, so level and HP don't matter.

, Make sure to save before the battle. The most successful way to catch this bird is to get its health into the red, then give it a status condition like Freeze, Sleep, or Paralyze. Once you have weakened Moltres, keep tossing Ultra Balls at the bird until it's caught.

Stock up on essential items.,
Head North upon reaching One Island.,
Climb Mt.,
Approach Moltres.,
Start the fight.,
Start throwing Poké Balls.",How to Catch Moltres in Pokémon Fire Red," In order to find Moltres, you will need to beat Blaine at the Cinnabar Gym and earn the Volcano Badge. You will receive a ferry ticket that will open up access to One Island and Mt. Ember where Moltres resides.;
, Fighting Moltres is going to be a tough battle, so make sure that your team is up to the challenge. Moltres is a level 50 Fire/Flying type Pokémon. You'll want Pokémon that can take a beating and are hopefully effective against Fire-type Pokémon. Bringing along a Pokémon with the ability Flash Fire will make them immune to Moltres' only two attacking moves, meaning he can never deal damage to them. Ponyta can be caught in the grass outside Mt. Ember where Moltres is found.


One of the most effective ways to catch Moltres is to have a Pokémon with False Swipe, which can get Moltres down to 1 HP without knocking it out.
You should also have a Pokémon that can paralyze or put Moltres to sleep. This will make it much easier to catch.
You will need a Pokémon with Strength or Rock Smash. You will receive Rock Smash on One Island.

, If you want to be absolutely safe, stockpile at least 40-50 Ultra Balls. Moltres can take a lot of Poké Balls to lock down. Also bring lots of Revives and Hyper Potions to heal your team.

, Once you get to the Island, head to the North. You will have to battle a lot of trainers along the way, but your team should be pretty powerful by now. You'll encounter wild Ponyta and Rapidash, which is the only place they can be found, so scoop one or two up if you feel like it.

, Ember. After reaching the top of Kindle Road, you'll need to Surf across a small body of water to reach Mt. Ember. Before crossing, you can heal up your Pokémon at Ember Spa.


You will need to navigate the maze of boulders inside and out of Mt. ember in order to reach the summit.

, At the summit of the mountain you will find Moltres nesting. Save your game before you start the fight. If you accidentally knock out Moltres or your party is wiped out, you can quickly reload and try the fight again. This is the only spot in the game to get Moltres, so better safe than sorry.

, Start off with your power hitters, and try to drain as much of Moltres' HP as you can. Once it starts to get low, switch to your Pokémon with False Swipes. Keep using False Swipes until Moltres only has 1 HP left.


Once Moltres' HP has been depleted, use a Sleep or Paralyze move to bind Moltres. This will make it much easier to catch. Switch back to your Flash Fire Pokémon if you brought one with you.

, Now that you have Moltres where you want it, start chucking your Ultra Balls at it. The battle now becomes a test of patience. You may burn through almost all of your Poké Balls before you are able to catch Moltres, but it is possible. If Moltres wakes up or becomes unparalyzed, hit it with a special move again and resume throwing Poké Balls.

Understand why you need to trade.,
Find someone with a Latias to trade, or catch one yourself in another game.,
Beat the Elite Four in FireRed.,
Connect the two games.,
Visit a Pokémon Center in each game.",How to Catch Latias in Pokémon Fire Red1," The only way to legitimately get Latias in your FireRed game is to trade from Sapphire, Ruby, or Emerald. Latias cannot be caught in the wild in FireRed unless you enter a cheat code using a CodeBreaker cheat device, or an emulator.;
, It is easiest to catch Latias in Sapphire and Emerald. In Ruby, you'll need an event ticket that is no longer available.


To catch Latias in Sapphire or Emerald, you'll need to defeat the Elite Four first. After defeating the Elite Four, you'll need to track Latias down, which can take a long time since it appears randomly across the map. Once you've tracked down Latias, use your Master Ball to capture it, or whittle its health down and use Ultra Balls. See this guide for detailed instructions on catching Latias in Sapphire, and here for instructions in Emerald.
If you're going to be trading for someone's Latias, you're going to need to be able to offer something equally rare in return. Legendaries like Rayquaza, Groudon, Kyogre, Deoxys and Mew all make good trading stock. You can also offer to trade a full team of well-trained Pokémon in exchange for the one Latias.

, Before you can trade Pokémon from Sapphire, Ruby, or Emerald, you'll need to defeat the Elite Four in FireRed. After defeating the Elite Four, you'll need to get the Ruby from Mt. Ember, the Sapphire from Ruin Valley, and the Sapphire in Five Island Meadow.

, You'll need two Gameboy Advance (GBA) consoles in order to trade between the games. You cannot use Nintendo DSs to perform the trade.


You can connect the two GBA devices using a GBA Link Cable, or by using the GBA Wireless Adapter for each GBA., You can initiate the trade by stalking with the person on the right when you enter the Pokémon Center.

Reduce Entei to a low enough HP (red is certainly enough) and paralyze it in your first few encounters.,
Catch a level 61 Golbat in the basement floor of Cerulean Cave.,
Give your Golbat the item Leftovers.,
Stock up on Ultra Balls, Full Restores, and Hyper Potions.,
Start with Mean Look.,
On the turns when you don't use Taunt, throw an Ultra Ball or heal your Golbat.",How to Catch Entei Without a Master Ball in Pokémon FireRed or LeafGreen," The damage is saved in each encounter even though it will flee.


It usually helps to paralyze first with a fast Pokémon, since you can then use slower Pokémon to deal damage during future encounters. If your lead Pokémon is slower than Entei, it will flee before you can deal any damage.
Your goal is not to catch Entei now; simply to weaken it for a later step. If you try to trap it, it will use Roar and you can never see it again.;
, Teach it TM 12 - Taunt, and if you have it, use your PP Max on Taunt (or at least a few PP Ups). Adding more PP isn't necessary, but it helps a lot. Pokémon with the Pickup ability can pick up PP Ups.

, You can get these by going to the locations where Snorlax was sleeping and using the Itemfinder.

, Then track down Entei one last time with the Golbat leading your party. Be sure to save at this point.


If you don't have any Ethers or Max Ethers, search online for some locations where they are hidden in the game. If you've used all of them up, you can still catch Entei, but you may need to soft reset a few times (especially if you did not PP Up or PP Max the Taunt).

, Entei will try to flee, but fail. Then, use the move Taunt. Taunt prevents Entei from using Roar for two turns, including the turn it was used on, so you must use the move Taunt on every other turn from now on. If you forget and Entei uses Roar, you have to reset the game, since Entei will permanently disappear.

, Since Entei doesn't know any powerful moves and Leftovers can restore most damage Entei deals, you won't need to heal too often. If Ember burns Golbat, use the Full Restore when Golbat's health is low. Otherwise, Hyper Potions are a cheaper alternative that work just as well.


Since Entei has the ability Pressure, even with PP Max, you can only use Taunt 16 times (10 times without any PP Ups). When you run out, use an Ether or Max Ether on the move Taunt, but remember to do so on a turn immediately after Taunt (i.e. a turn you would heal or throw an Ultra Ball).

See Catch the 3 Regis in Pokémon Sapphire or Ruby for instructions on getting the three Golems.


There are essentially two scenarios for obtaining the three Golems and Regigigas in Platinum. The common way is to transfer the three Golems from Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald, then capture Regigigas in Platinum. The other way involves using a special event Regigigas in Platinum to obtain the three Golems without Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald. Since the event is over, this is no longer possible without cheating.

Ideally you'll want a Pokémon that also knows a Bug, Ghost, or Dark attack, as these will be the most effective against Mesprit. False Swipe is also an good move for lowering its health safely, but can take a lot longer.
An alternative option is to put a Wobbuffet or Wynaut with the Shadow Tag ability at the front of your party. Shadow Tag can prevent the Mesprit from fleeing. Wobbuffet is much slower than Mesprit, however, and will likely not last long in battle., Since Mesprit has a high speed, Quick Balls get an extra catch bonus against it. Stock up on these; you may need 40 or more if you're unlucky. You'll also need a lot of repels to ensure that you only encounter Mesprit

, You'll need this tool from the Poketch Company in Jubilife City in order to know when Mesprit is in the same area as you. You'll need to find the three clowns around town and answer their trivia questions.


You'll find one clown next to the Pokémon Center, one in front of the Poketch Company headquarters, and one in front of the TV station.

, Once you've defeated Team Galactic and your party is ready, you can head to Lake Verity and cause Mesprit to appear. Flying to Twinleaf Town is the quickest way to get to the lake.

, You'll find the Verity Cavern entrance in the middle of the lake.

, You'll see Mesprit in the center of the room.

, It will look like the battle is about to start, and then Mesprit will run away before it begins. Professor Rowan will inform you that Mesprit is now roaming throughout Sinnoh, and that you can track it on the map.


Roaming Pokémon like Mesprit will change locations every time you move between locations. This can make tracking them down difficult, but there's a trick you can use to speed it up.

, Walking between these two locations is the most effective way to encounter a roaming Pokémon due to the close proximity of tall grass on each side and the low level wild Pokemon.

, Each time you walk from one location to the other, Mesprit will move to a new location in Sinnoh. You can see its current location flashing on your Marking Map in the lower screen.


Mesprit's movements are random, so you may have to go back and forth many times until you're both in the same spot.

, Once you've changed locations and Mesprit is in the same location you are, use a Repel so that you don't encounter any other Pokemon. If you encounter another Pokémon or start a battle with a trainer, Mesprit will move and you'll have to start over.

, Save before attempting to encounter Mesprit so you can quickly try again if you accidentally mess up.

, Since you're using a Repel, you won't encounter any Pokémon lower than your first Pokemon's level. This will prevent you from encountering any of the wild Pokémon in these two areas. If your first Pokémon is over level 50, the Repel will prevent you from encountering Mesprit.

, Your first order of business is making sure Mesprit is affected by Freeze, Paralyze, or Sleep. This will make it easier to catch. Mesprit will escape immediately after, but the status ailment will still be present when you encounter it next.


You can use your Master Ball to catch Mesprit instantly, but you may want to save it for other elusive rare Pokémon later.

, After Mesprit runs away from your first encounter, you can walk back and forth between Route 205 and Valley Windworks until it appears again. Remember to use another Repel once you're in the same location, then enter the tall grass or surf to encounter it.

, This will take a big chunk of its health down. You'll hopefully get it down to yellow health, or even red if you're lucky. Mesprit will run, but the damage you've done will stay when you encounter it again.


If you accidentally knock Mesprit out, you'll need to load your save and try again.

, Mesprit will always run after your first action, so do the back-and-forth again until it appears. You'll be getting very familiar with the entrances to these two areas! Remember to use a Repel once you're in the same location.

, You can use regular attacks that aren't very effective, or use False Swipe to lower it to 1 HP. The goal is to get the health bar into the red zone. Every time Mesprit runs, you'll need to walk between the two locations until it appears again.


Make sure you don't knock it out! If you knock out Mesprit, you'll need to load your saved game and try again.

, The first time you encounter Mesprit when it has red health, throw a Quick Ball as your first move. If you're lucky, you'll catch Mesprit on the first try. Chances are it will break free and run, though.

, Mesprit will run after your first move each time. This means you'll only get one Quick Ball throw in per encounter. It may take 20-30 tries, but you should eventually catch Mesprit this way."

,,, Bring your Master Ball if you have one. Have high level Pokémon that are at least level 50 or higher.


You'll be in a cave, so Dusk Balls are very good balls to use to catch Giratina. Ultra Balls work well, too.

, A good Pokémon to use is a normal/flying Pokémon like Staraptor because Giratina's offensive moves (apart from Slash) won't hurt it. This comes in use because Giratina's move (Shadow Force) is also very powerful.

, You will only be able to access this path after you receive the National Pokedex.

, It is called this because once you enter a room from another, if you come back the way you came, you won't end up in the same room you came from. It can be very confusing as it is a maze.


You need to find your way past three pillars in the cave before you go through thirty rooms. If you encounter a pillar, it will tell you how many pillars you've passed (the number on the top) and the number of rooms you have been through (the number on the bottom.) Thirty rooms is a lot to go through and many people make it past three pillars and to Giratina before reaching that.

, It will automatically lead you to Giratina. Giratina will be standing there in a mighty way. Talk to it. The battle will ensue.

, It can be in the yellow, but getting it in the red is recommended. Try not to faint it. Ice, Ghost, Dragon and Dark type moves are very effective. Use Fire, Water, Electric, Bug, Grass and Poison type moves to get the health down slowly so you won't make Giratina faint.

,


If you run out of Poke Balls, get defeated or faint it, reset. In case you don't know the drill, always save before attempting to catch a very rare Pokémon if you can (which you can with Giratina before talking to it).

She has over 800,000 HP and can wipe out your entire party in 1 hit if you go in unprepared. To be prepared, you will need the following:


Fully upgraded Celestial weapons with Break Damage Limit for your party (Increases the damage you can deal from 9,999 to 99,999)
Break HP Limit (Raises your HP limit from 9,999 to 99,999)
Auto-Haste (Constant Haste effect that will give you more turns in battle)

, Travel to Besaid by choosing it from the list of places available on the airship.

, You will be blocked by a member of Yu Yevon, who will summon Dark Valefor.

, To begin, make sure that you have Wakka in your party.

, This should be done as soon as the battle begins.

, You can also use the skill Quick Hit (Sphere Grid skill) to attack Dark Valefor; each hit will still do 99,999 damage.


It’s recommended you use Tidus, Wakka, and Rikku for this method since they have the highest agility, making them attack faster and therefore have more turns.

,


Getting 2 hits on the reel mini-game takes some practice, but is highly worth mastering as it gives a high amount of damage boost.
If you get 2 hits, Wakka will attack with 12 hits; paired with the Break Damage Limit skill from his Celestial weapon, he will do a total of 1,199,988 to Dark Valefor, which will instantly kill her.
If you fail to get 2 hits on the reel, Wakka will only attack 6 times.

There are two methods to do this.",How to Know Who's a Slasher on The N's Slasher Game1," The second is a cheat. If the first way doesn't work for you or help/improve your skill, then try out the second one!

"
"
Pay attention and always be playing.,
Act like a plain ol' camper, not a special role or slasher!,
Don't trust anyone!,
Don't tell ANYBODY who the slashers are if you know.,
Don't lie to yourself.,
Watch closely who's on and who's not.,
Don't reveal any personal info or slashers may slash you next!

,
Don't say you know who the slasher is or you think you know who is/have clues.,
Listen to others and not majority.,
Don't give up!,
If you don't know who might be a slasher, try killing off a person that's always been offline.,
Also, if 2-4 people are blaming other people a LOT, they are most likely slashers trying to protect themselves.

",How to Know Who's a Slasher on The N's Slasher Game2," At night you can go do something else but you must come back when it's day! (In-game day and night.);
, Acting mysterious or strange will automatically get people to kill or eliminate you. Also, when ANYBODY private messages you or whatever asking you what your role is, say you are a camper. Make sure you sure SOUND like it! You can watch other campers do the same and copy their methods if they are doing really good.

, If someone asks who you are, just say you're a camper and that's it. Say it's pretty boring and don't let them try to drag anything else out of you!

, Only tell the ones that FOR SURE are campers and you have real proof/reasonable reasons to back that up!

, You can lie to all the other players, though!

, Are some people on for a while at night and then go off or stay on and then at day, they leave? That's most likely a slasher!


Is anyone on the entire time but aren't talking, especially during the day but might be only private messaging SOME people? They're probably slashers!

,, The slashers will tell each other you know too much and they'll kill you off! So whenever you are going to tell people stuff like that and you're sure the slashers are going to kill you, have the cop protect you! Don't know who the cop is? You can ask others!

, Only do majority voting (vote for the person with the most votes so far) when people (larger amount of campers than slashers left) have good enough back-up/evidence!

, This makes you a good victim to kill off for the slashers!

, This works, too, because sometimes all the other slashers are dead already and every night nobody's been attempted to be killed. Eliminate all the offline people, then!

,"
"
You can't be the reporter/slasher or this will not work!

,
Zoom in to 400% and scroll down, right, up, left, whichever directions until you find the game.

,
You should see the slasher chat box!,
You might be saying, ""But how will I know who's talking?"",
Make sure the cop protects you for the best, safest results!

,
Following ALL of these steps EXACTLY and accurately gives your team about a 98% chance to WIN!

",How to Know Who's a Slasher on The N's Slasher Game3,",, Don't click to go to ""Normal Chat"", though, or the cheat will stop working.

, Well... you'll get to see their names! You might not find all of the slashers, though, because one or two might not be chatting there.

 Practice, practice, practice.",How to Learn the Basics of Tekken," The first thing you will notice about Tekken is their large character select. In Tekken 7 there are a total of thirty-three characters, not including DLC. So, the first you will want to do is find a character that you connect with whether it be aesthetics or a certain move you like.
, Once you have found a character that you can relate with, you will want to work on movement. Tekken is a 3D fighter, meaning that you can move around the whole arena, you are not confined to just walking back and forth.

Since Tekken is a 3D fighter you should familiarize yourself with back dashing and side stepping (stepping into the background/foreground) these movements will help you avoid incoming attacks.
As for blocking, you automatically block incoming attacks unless they are low then you simple crouch. You can always hold back to make sure the character blocks.
There are also moves associated with movement, such as tackles or shoulders when you dash fullscreen. Another move is a low parry, where all you have to do is crouch when they hit you with a low attack.

, After you are familiarized with movement you should start to work on basic combos. There is specific move list for each character in the game. You can enter practice mode to access this menu, the game will allow you to have one move on the screen while you play. There are around one hundred moves for each character, so there is a lot to practice., Now that you have your movements and basic combos down, you can work on simple juggles. A juggle is a continued strain of moves that can deal massive amounts of damage. To start a juggle you first need to learn the launchers for your character. Launchers throw the opponent into the air then you can do the combos you learned previously to do more damage. There are also screw moves which you use to make your combos longer., Another area that you should familiarize yourself with is grapples. After you block enough of your opponent's moves, they will usually go for a grapple, but don't worry as they can be reversed with practice.

Grapples are a huge part of Tekken and can deal massive amounts of damage if not broken. Grapples are performed by pressing two buttons at the same time (2+4/triangle+circle/Y+B) these buttons vary depending on what you are playing the game on. Most grapples can be reversed by pressing one of the punch buttons, but there are special grapples where you need to know what two buttons they pressed.
There are also chain grapples with some characters that can take half your health bar away if not broken, so try to learn those sooner rather than later. The most infamous character for these chain grapples is King.

, There is also a new mechanic introduced with Tekken 7 that you should familiarize yourself with and that is rage arts/drives. These special moves activate when you are low on health and can change the whole course of the match.

When you are low on health your character starts to glow red this means you are in rage, when in rage you do extra damage and have access to these special moves. The lower your characters health is the more damage rage arts do.
The other move that you can do is called a rage drive which starts a combo for you. Rage drives are really useful for pressuring your opponent. When you use the rage drive your character will glow blue for the duration of the move.

, Another new mechanic added in Tekken 7 are power crushes. Power crushes are certain moves that each character has that gives you armor while you attack. You will still take damage while you attack, but your move will still connect. Just beware when using these moves you won't die, or that you will get the better trade in health., Like most fighting games, Tekken has walls, and that means massive amounts of damage. Wall splats are one of the most useful tools in fighting games, the wall will let you trap your opponent and drag your combos on longer. In Tekken when you opponent is against the wall and you hit them it adds extra damage. Each character has their own moves that work well with this mechanic and learning those moves will make you exponentially better., In Tekken you can also punish your opponent. A punish is when you block, side step, or parry a move and get a combo off of it. All the moves in Tekken have different rates of recovery, so with learning the game through experience you will be able to find when those opportunities arise and profit from them., One last thing to take into consideration when comboing is wall carries/the location of your character and the wall. As mentioned previously wall combos can do massive amounts of damage and can win you the game. There are some strains that carry your opponent farther across the map towards the wall. Learning the moves will help you get that wall damage you need to finish off your opponent., Once you have taken all the previous steps into consideration and are more comfortable with the game, move on to online matches. Practice mode and AIs can only get you so far, eventually you will have to move onto the real deal. Unfortunately there is no set way to play this game, so every match you play will be unique and you will have to react quickly if you want to succeed., Just like most things in life, practice makes perfect. Obviously, the more you play the game the better you will get. Unfortunately there is no shortcut to experience, so no matter how discouraging it might be just keep pushing through and practice. After playing the game long enough you will be able to see character moves and know when to punish them or where you need to block. Hopefully you found this article helpful and best of wishes in your Tekken career."

Complete all the loyalty missions.,
Be forewarned: some loyalty missions have conditions that will prevent them from becoming loyal if met.,
Deal with in-fighting.,
Purchase your ship upgrades.,
Go to the Omega-4 Relay quickly.,
Choose your squadmates' roles wisely for the infiltration.,
Assign roles for moving through the seeker swarm.,
Assign Mordin to help the crew return to the Normandy.,
Decide who to leave holding the line.",How to Help All of Your Crew Survive the Final Mission of Mass Effect 2," Securing the loyalty of your squadmates helps their chances of survival greatly. This is accomplished via the completion of their respective loyalty missions.;
, They are as follows:


Zaeed: If you choose to help the refinery workers, and lack the Paragon points to open up the subsequent Charm dialogue option with Zaeed, Vido will escape, and you will not gain Zaeed's loyalty.
Tali: If you present evidence of Tali's father performing illicit geth experiments to the admirals, his name will be stricken from the ranks of every ship he served on and he will be posthumously exiled. Although Tali will be cleared of her charges of treason, you will not gain her loyalty.
Thane: If you take too much time keeping Thane apprised to Talid's location, his son Kolyat will assassinate him, and you will not gain Thane's loyalty.
Samara: If you fail to capture Morinth's attention, or make her lose interest in you while talking to her, she will leave, and you will not gain Samara's loyalty.

, At two points, there will be in-fighting among your squadmates after completing both of their respective loyalty missions: one between Miranda and Jack, and another between Tali and Legion.


If you have accrued a high enough Paragon/Renegade score, you can open a Charm/Intimidate dialogue option to defuse the conflict while maintaining both squadmates' loyalties.
If you do not have a high enough Paragon/Renegade score, however, you will be forced to side with one or the other. In this case, you will lose the loyalty of whoever you sided against, although you can gain back their loyalty afterwards by talking to them with a high enough Paragon/Renegade score to unlock the Charm/Intimidate dialogue choice that will get you back in their good graces.
If you side against Jack in her feud with Miranda, however, your loyalty will be permanently lost.

, There are three ship upgrades you can purchase for the Normandy through the Research Terminal in Mordin's lab. Purchasing them will ensure your squadmates' survival. Lacking any of them when you pass through the Omega-4 relay will result in the death of one squadmate for each upgrade you lack. They are as follows:


Heavy Ship Armor: Unlocked and after completing Jacob's loyalty mission. If you do not have it, Jack will die.
Multicore Shielding: Unlocked after Tali's loyalty mission. Without it, one of your crew members will die.
Thanix Cannons: Unlocked after Garrus's loyalty mission. Without it, one of your crew members will die.

, After getting the Reaper IFF, you will be able to perform one more mission before the Collectors abduct the Normandy's crew. Afterwards, you will need to act quickly. If you do more than one mission after the crew's abduction, they will die by the time you reach them.


As such, it's recommended to save the Reaper IFF mission until you have completed everything you wish to complete, then use the short time you have before the Collector's abduction of your crew to complete Legion's loyalty mission.

, Once you pass through the Omega-4 relay and arrive at the Collector Base, you will be tasked with sending two teams through the base. You will also need to choose an infiltration specialist to work their way through the ventilation ducts to ensure both teams can rendezvous. Ensure that whoever you choose is loyal: if they are not loyal, or you choose anyone except those listed below, the infiltration specialist will die.


Infiltration Specialist: Legion, Tali, or Kasumi
Fireteam Leader: Garrus, Miranda, or Jacob

, After the infiltration, you will need to choose a second fireteam leader and a biotic specialist to help you move through the seeker swarm. If you choose an disloyal or unideal biotic specialist, one of the squadmates accompanying you during the next segment will die. If you choose a disloyal or unideal fire-team leader, they will die.


Biotic Specialist: Samara/Morinth or Jack
Fireteam Leader: Garrus, Miranda, or Jacob

, Before setting off for the next segment, if you arrived in time to rescue the crew of the Normandy, you will be given the option to send one of your squadmates with them to help them return to the Normandy. Mordin is the most ideal squadmate to help the crew return to the Normandy: his relatively low defense stats makes him susceptible to dying later on.

, Before heading off for the final battle, you will be given one last opportunity to choose squadmates, while the rest remain behind to hold the line and keep the Collectors busy. It is most ideal to take squadmates with lower defensive stats with you, such as Tali, Kasumi, Mordin, and Jack, since they're more likely to die while holding the line. In contrast, it is best to leave tankier squadmates such as Grunt, Zaeed, and Garrus to hold the line, as this will ensure the survival of everyone else holding the line (so long as they are loyal, of course).

Know that you'll need to stay on the move.,

Get a mouse with extra buttons.,
Browse a reputable retailer for your options.,

Pick useful buttons.,
Bind the buttons you use most, followed by useful buttons out of reach.

Use a mouse with more than 4 buttons.,Bind more functions to the mouse so your hand has to leave WASD even less.,
Get used to using extra buttons.,
Decide on button use through experience.",How to Keybind a Gaming Mouse for FPS Style Games," Mobility is the most important thing when playing an FPS game; a stationary target is a dead target. This means when playing a game taking your hands off movement control can be a death sentence.
, This is what you'll need to access easily to keep you moving.

Mobility keys include W+A+S+D, Space Bar, ⇧ Shift, Ctrl or C, your mouse pointer and Scope (Aim Down Sight/ADS).

, More keys than posted above are needed to play a FPS. You'll need commands for melee, reload, gadgets, menu, voice chat and others.

To activate these commands that are integral to playing the game you often have to remove your fingers from movement keys.
Extra buttons that the other hand can activate means you are more likely to survive.

,


A gaming mouse can fill some of these extra button slots so that your hands don't have to leave WASD.
Gaming mice can be cheaper than $20, but good mice can be $30-60. They often come with close to 4 extra buttons, some have more than 10.
This is a lot of wiggle room for deciding which buttons should be migrated to the mouse.

, Amazon offers many mice from the very cheap to the extravagant. A low-end mouse may suit your needs, so don't assume it has to be high end.

Many gaming mice come with software that will allow you to easily bind commands to the extra buttons

, Most games use commonly use buttons mapped around WASD, but some are easier to reach than others, and some more used than others.


Q, E, R, T, and Tab ↹ are very easy to reach and generally do not need to be rebound.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, T, and G are also fairly easy to reach but depending on use, may be useful on the mouse.
The most used buttons should be rebound first, followed by useful buttons that are further away.

,

3 of the most useful buttons are Ctrl, C and V.

Ctrl and C are usually crouch or prone. This is a hitbox transformation which allows the player to use cover effectively.

V is generally Melee, this allows the player to kill an enemy at very close range and is also incredibly useful.
These are both recommended to be rebound to the mouse

,,

At this point most people will have 1 or 2 buttons left to bind if Crouch and Melee have been bound.

,

If teamwork is very important and there is a built in team-speak function, this should be bound to one of the buttons. This will allow for better team communication without game performance sacrifice.
For games where the player mainly plays a sniper, one button could be rebound to a DPI switch (some gaming mice will have a switch built, but most gaming mice software will allow the player to create a custom switch). This will allow the player to switch the sensitivity of the mouse with a single button press for more accurate shots.
If there are gadgets the player uses that are outside of the number buttons this could be bound. For example, T to equip the gas mask in Battlefield 1.
You may also find that some keys which are close by but unnatural to click would be useful on the mouse. For example, activate ultimate in Overwatch is Q, but binding this to the mouse instead will reduce accidental ultimates.
If the FPS game is single player like Far-Cry, then there are many tools for the player like crafting and map, binding these to the mouse will make activating them less annoying.

,, The Razer Naga has 17 programmable buttons all together so this allows many more functions to be bound.There are also many other mice with programmable buttons ranging from 5-20 in number.


In Battlefield 1 where there are many gadgets and keys that follow, this is especially useful.

,, Having a mouse with programmed functions will take some time getting used to, especially if the player is migrating to PC from console.

Throughout gaming you might find that you use some buttons more than others, so binding these to the mouse instead of others will make more sense for your personal gaming style.

, Play the game more often and find which keys will work best for you on your mouse.

In the end buttons on the mouse are up to the individual to decide; this is just a general guide for binding keys strategically to a mouse.

Stock up on healing items.,
Navigate your way through Mt Silver beforehand.,
Build your team of Pokémon.,
Get to know Red's Pokémon.,
Climb Mt.,
Battle Red.,
Defeat Red.",How to Defeat Red in Heartgold/Soulsilver," Red's Pokémon are extremely high leveled, with his pikachu topping the numbers at a whopping Lv.88. It is best advised that your Pokémon are at least Lv75. The higher the better. If your Pokémon are lower than this level, it is highly uncertain that you will succeed against Red.;
, You will need a ton of powerful healing items and boosting items. It is highly recommended that you carry enough Revives, Full Restores and Full heals. 30 of each should do the job.

, Navigating through Mt. Silver is a good choice before actually meeting with Red for the battle. If you can easily traverse through the mountain without any hiccups or without any Pokémon fainting, you're almost ready to battle Red. If your Pokémon are not quite up to the mark, then consider training at Mt. Silver itself, as the wild Pokémon are pretty high leveled there as well.

, Your average team to battle trainers and elite four might not cut it in front of Red. As such a specialized Pokémon is needed to beat all his six Pokémon. Consider choosing six Pokémon from the recommended list below.


Recommended list:

Steelix, Best against Red's Pikachu
Electric Pokémon, Ampharos/Electabuzz recommended, against his Lapras/Blastoise
Rock Pokémon, Tyranitar recommended.
Your Starter Pokémon
Fighting Pokémon/Mewtwo. Given Mewtwo's incredible power and versatile moveset, it's recommended to use him instead.
A HM slave Pokémon/Filler Pokémon. This Pokémon may not have much use in the battle. Use it to revive a much more powerful Pokémon, or to heal other Pokémon. Alternatively, Use a powerful legendary Pokémon in this slot, such as Ho-Oh.



, Red's Pokémon have some unique moves to help them counter their weaknesses.His Pokémon are:



Pikachu. His highest level Pokémon and the one he leads with. It is Level 88 and holds a Light Ball, an item that doubles Pikachu's Attack and Special Attack, making it all the more dangerous. Fortunately, it succumbs easily to Ground type Pokémon, especially Steelix, since none of it's attacks can put a scratch on it. Red's Pikachu knows Volt Tackle, Iron Tail, Quick Attack, Thunderbolt, all of which simply fail against Steelix. The Pokémon he calls out next depends on which Pokémon you lead with.

Snorlax. This might as well be his hardest Pokémon to defeat, given is colossal HP stat. It knows crunch, so it might be well advised to keep your Mewtwo away from him. Snorlax knows Giga Impact, Crunch, Shadow Ball and Blizzard. Blizzard is especially deadly since it has perfect accuracy and an increased chance of sustaining a freeze condition. A Strong fighting Pokémon should bring him down to its knees fairly quickly. Have a Pokémon with High HP and resistance to Ice moves, such as lapras can also work.

Lapras. Being the only member in Red's team to be immune from hail damage, it may take a hit or two to bring Lapras down, given its massive HP stat. It knows Brine, Blizzard, Psychic and Body Slam. The best counter to Red's lapras is to have a Lapras of your own which knows Thunderbolt and preferably has the water absorb ability.Beware of body slam however, since it may easily render your Pokémon paralyzed.

Venusaur. First of Red's three Kanto starters, Red's Venusaur is not a particular pain to battle and bring down. However it can be extremely annoying since it knows Sludge bomb, a move that can easily poison your Pokémon, and Sleep Powder, rendering your Pokémon useless for at least a few turns. It also knows Giga Drain and Frenzy Plant, which may very well take your Pokémon out, or two.

Charizard. Second of Red's three Kanto starters, and one of his strongest Pokémon. Charizard has an especially high Attack and Special Attack stat, it also knows moves to abuse its ridiculous attack stats such as Flare Blitz, Blast Burn, Dragon Pulse and Air Slash. It is by no means a slouch either, being fairly quick. Rock Pokémon shut Charizard down instantly, especially Tyranitar with its sand stream ability.

Blastoise.The last of his Kanto starter Pokémon. Not a particularly difficult Pokémon to defeat. Beware, however, of his Blizzard attack since it has perfect accuracy in hail. It knows Blizzard, Flash Cannon, Focus Blast and Hydro Cannon, but can be easily shut down with a strong electric Pokémon.

, Silver again. This time however, go forward with your elite team of Pokémon. Keep in mind that you need to use some HMs to climb to the very top, where Red resides.

, Save beforehand to be on the safe side!

, Beat the ultimate trainer and watch the credits roll for the second time. Congratulations, you've beat all of Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver!

Entei and Raikou.,
Well, first things first, complete the entire game before trying to capture the legendary Pokémon.,
Wake up the sleeping Snorlax outside of Diglett's Cave and catch it using Poke Balls that would suit the Snorlax for example, Heavy Balls (only do this after you've completed the Kanto region as well as Johto).

Once you have Snorlax, fly back to Johto.

,
Open up the PokeGear and click on the map icon, you should see the images of both legendary Pokémon on your map.

Cianwood City.,
Route 42, outside Mt.,
Vermillion City.,
The final area is Route 14 of Kanto.,
After you encounter it these five times, you'll need to go to Cerulean City.

,
You then have to find the Gym Leader, Misty, who is located at the small mountain grove near Bill's house.

,
After you defeat Misty at her Gym, Suicune will be in the grove where you met Misty.

,
It's suggested that you capture Zapdos before you face Suicune and teach your Zapdos 'Charge Beam' as Suicune is a water Pokémon so electricity will affect it the most.

,
But, if you started out with Chikorita then Grass-type moves will work just as well.

,
Try capturing Suicune in the same way as the other two, with Dusk Balls and Ultra Balls.,
You should've been able to catch all 3.

",How to Capture All Three Legendary Dogs in Pokémon SoulSilver and HeartGold,";
, You see, both Entei and Raikou will just escape from a battle whenever you try to catch them. Through work, however, you can beat them. Here's a way that has successfully worked.

,,,, In this tutorial we will go after Entei. Some attempt to go after two at a time but it doesn't work nearly as well as simply choosing one and sticking to it.

, It's recommended to do this at night *game wise, not real-world *, as this means you can use both Ultra Balls and Dusk Balls.

,).

, After finding Entei this is automatic.

,, You should only do this one. There are also few other Pokémon you can use to catch Entei.

,, It won't take much damage, and it heals itself anyway with it's item, 'Leftovers'.

,, It isn't tricky to capture, but it takes a few encounters before you can catch it.

, You can't find it by searching your PokeGear. Instead, you have to encounter it several times in order to finally capture it (you don't need Snorlax for this one).

,,, Suicune is at the north of this island. As always, it will vanish but Ensuine (Pokémon fanatic who is also after Suicune) will battle you.

, Mortar. You should be able to surf west a bit and find a tree you can cut. It will lead you to a small grove with three tree with berries in the middle. Suicune will be there.

, Suicune will be there on the port leading off of the S.S. Aqua.

, It's towards Route 13.

Level Muscle to at least level 18.,
Use its Low Kick and Karate Chop attacks against the Miltank.",How to Defeat Whitney's Miltank in Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal1," He'll ask for Drowzee in Gold and Silver, and Abra in Crystal. Both can be found on Route 34, the route below Goldenrod City. Abra can also be bought from the Game Corner for 200 coins if you don't want to deal with it fleeing from a wild battle.;
, Whitney's Miltank is level 20, so you'll want to level it up high enough to stand a chance against the Miltank.

, Given that those attacks are Fighting-type attacks, they'll be super effective. It'll also be resistant to Miltank's Rollout (a Rock-type attack), and if it's female, immune to its Attract attack.

"
"
Have a Pokémon with an attack that lowers accuracy such as Smokescreen or Sand-Attack.,
Use your accuracy-lowering attack against the Miltank.,
After using your accuracy-lowering attack against the Miltank a few times, attack it.",How to Defeat Whitney's Miltank in Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal2," If you started with Cyndaquil, it'll learn Smokescreen while Pidgey can learn Sand-Attack. Both should be evolved to their second forms by the time you reach Whitney.

, By lowering its accuracy, its attacks will miss more often, giving you a better chance of defeating it.

, Special attacks such as Thundershock or Ember will work better than physical attacks, given Miltank's lower special defense. You can buy Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, and Ice Punch in the Goldenrod Department Store if you have any Pokémon that can learn one or more of those attacks (Abra, in particular, can learn all three and has a high special attack).

"
"
Capture a Gastly and have it learn Curse.,
Use Curse against her Miltank.,
Attack and/or status the Miltank while it's under the curse.",How to Defeat Whitney's Miltank in Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal3," Curse will cut down Gastly's HP in exchange for a curse that damages the opposing Pokémon every turn.

, Stomp won't affect your Gastly, so if your Gastly is female, Miltank will have to resort to Rollout, which will be unlikely to KO your Gastly on the first turn.

, Eventually, Miltank should go down to a combination of your attack damage and the damage from the curse.

"
"
Get a Pokémon with an attack that inflicts a status on the opposing Pokémon.,
Use your status-inflicting attack on the Miltank.,
Attack the Miltank while it's under the status you inflict on it.

",How to Defeat Whitney's Miltank in Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal4," By this point, you'll be able to inflict paralysis, poison, or sleep. If you started with Chikorita, it'll be able to learn Stun Spore and Poison Powder.


Paralysis lowers a Pokémons' speed and has a 25% chance of stopping the Pokémon from making a move during a turn.
Poison damages the opponent a bit at the end of their turn.
Sleep makes the opponent fall asleep, preventing them from moving until they wake up.

, Poison or paralysis is your best bet here, given that sleep isn't always reliable, but whichever you use is your preference.

,"
"
Get the TM for Rollout, which is north of Goldenrod City on Route 35.

,
Teach it to a compatible Pokémon, which includes Geodude and Quilava.

,
Use Rollout on Clefairy.",How to Defeat Whitney's Miltank in Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal5,",, By the time Clefairy is KO'd, Rollout should have already gone for 3 or 4 turns, making it very powerful. When Miltank comes out, it'll be hit by Rollout, and (depending on your level) should do a good amount of damage against it, if not a one-hit KO. If it misses at any point, you get flinched by Miltank's Stomp attack, or your Pokémon is immobilized by love through Attract, though, Rollout will end, making this strategy dependent on luck.

"
"
Catch a Geodude or Onix.,
Use it against the Miltank.",How to Defeat Whitney's Miltank in Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal6," Preferably, a female one, since a female one will be immune to Attract. You can trade a Bellsprout for Onix in Violet City, or catch one in Union Cave. Geodude can also be caught in Union Cave, along with Dark Cave and the bottom part of Route 46.

, Both Geodude and Onix are Rock/Ground-types and have high defense, making them a good choice to use against Whitney.

"
"
Choose Totodile as your starter Pokémon and have it learn Rage.,
Use Rage against Clefairy.",How to Defeat Whitney's Miltank in Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal7," Rage is an attack that increases your attack power when you're hit, as long as it's used consecutively. By the time you reach Whitney, Totodile should have evolved into Croconaw.

, If you get lucky, Clefairy will use Double Slap and hit you 5 times with it, increasing your attack power with each hit. By the time it's KO'd and Miltank comes out, you should hopefully have enough attack power to do a good amount of damage against Miltank. If Rage misses or you use a different attack, though, the attack power will reset, so be sure that you're using it constantly.

"
Battle Electric-type Pokémon.,
Avoid fighting Ice, Water, Grass, and other similar Ground-type Pokémon.,
Gain enough XP, or experience points.",How to Evolve a Pupitar," Pupitar is a Ground-type Pokémon and is generally immune to attacks of electric types, receiving little to no damage at all.;
, Pupitar is weak against these types and will take severe damage if attacked by either a Water- or Grass-type Pokémon.

, Pupitar evolves to Tyranitar at level 55, so until then, you have to make Pupitar battle as much as possible.


You can’t use stones to make Pupitar evolve. There are no in-game stones, such as Fire and Water Stones, that you could use to force it to evolve.

Obtain a Super Rod.,
Head to the Safari Zone.,
Start fishing.,
Throw a Rock.,
Throw a Safari Ball.,
Train your Dratini.",How to Catch Dratini in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen1," You will need the best rod in the game in order to catch Dratini. You can get the Super Rod on Route 12 in the house with a Fisherman inside. Talk to him and you will receive the Super Rod.;
, Dratini can only be caught in the Safari Zone. You don't need to worry about which Pokémon you will use to fight, as there are no battles in the Safari Zone. You can get to the Safari Zone from Fuchsia City., Dratini can be caught in any of the four areas of the Safari Zone. Throw your line out into any body of water you see to start fishing. There is a 15% chance that the Pokémon you catch will be a Dratini.


When you hook a Pokémon, you will need to press the A button to set the hook, otherwise the Pokémon will get away.
There is a 1% chance that you will catch a Dragonair, Dratini's evolution.

, You have four options when you start a Safari Zone battle: you can throw Bait, a Rock, or a Safari Ball, or you can Run. Throwing Bait will make it less likely to run away but decreases the catch chance. Throwing a Rock will make it easier to capture, but increases the chance it will run away.


Throwing Bait followed by a Rock will cancel the effects of each. If you want to improve the catch chance, either throw one Rock, or a Bait followed by two rocks.

, If the ball doesn't capture the Dratini, it will have a chance to run away. If it runs, you will need to fish again to catch another one. If it stays, you can try another Safari Ball on your next turn.

, Once you've caught your Dratini, you can start training it to eventually evolve it into a Dragonite. Dratini can be used in a variety of party builds, thanks to its speed and Dragon-type attacks. To get the most out of your training, make sure to check out this guide on managing EVs, which can greatly affect the way your Dratini plays."

Release Suicune into the wild.,
Stock up on essential items.,
Assemble the team.,
Save your game.,
Start the battle.,
Start throwing Poké Balls.",How to Catch Suicune in Pokémon Crystal1," In order to make Suicine available for capture, you will need to trigger certain events in the game. Only after triggering these events will you be able to go to Tin Tower and attempt to capture the legendary Pokémon for yourself.


Visit the Burned Tower in Ecruteak City and talk to Eusine.
Fall down the hole after battling Eusine.
Walk onto the platform to awaken the three Legendary Pokémon.
Surf to Cianwood City to catch a glimpse of Suicune.
After beating Pryce at Mahogany town, go beat Team Rocket at the Johto Radio Tower.
Return to Ecruteak City and visit the Tin Tower. The guard will allow you to pass.;
, Before battling Suicune, you'll want to ensure that you have enough items to keep you alive for a long fight. Grab lots of Hyper Potions, and as many Ultra Balls as you can afford (it is recommended that you have anywhere from 30-50 Balls).

, You can make quick work of Suicine with the right team. Since you don't want to knock Suicune out, but you want to get it as weak as possible, one of the moves you'll want to have on your Pokémon is False Swipe. Put a high-level Scyther or Scizor in your party for this role.


You'll also want someone to put Suicune to sleep with a move like Hypnosis. Gengar or Haunter may be good choices for this role.

, Immediately before fighting Suicune, make sure that your game is saved. This will make it easy to retry in case you accidentally knock it out or your party gets wiped out.

, As soon as the fight starts, put Suicune to sleep. Once Suicune is asleep, switch to your Scyther or Scizor and start using False Swipe. False Swipe will always leave the opponent with at least one HP, so continue using it until Suicune has only one hit point left.


If Suicune wakes up at any point, switch back to Haunter/Gengar and use Hypnosis again.

, Now that Suicune only has one hit point left, it's time to start chucking Poké Balls at it. Use any ball––Ultra, Master, Great, Poke, Fast, and Lure Balls all work. This can take a really long time, so be prepared to keep throwing balls. Make sure that Suicune is asleep, as this will make it much easier to catch."

Use GameShark or any other similar device.,
Put in the code.,
Insert the second code.,
Catch Celebi.",How to Catch Celebi in Pokémon Crystal1," The only way to obtain Celebi in Pokémon Crystal is by unlocking the Celebi Quest, which is hidden within the game. GameShark can be purchased online.


If GameShark isn't available, you can use Code Breaker or Game Genie. These devices are already proven and used by many console gamers.
If you plan on using another method aside from using GameShark, keep in mind that there are risks of messing up your Pokedex. The safest way to obtain Celebi is by using this method.;
, Before anything else, start your game with your GameShark or other similar device and then inject this code into your game: 0173D2D0.


After inserting the code, head to any Pokemart and buy one GS Ball.
After purchasing GS Ball, save your game and then shut it off.

, Switch your game back on with GameShark (or other device) and then insert this code to unlock the quest: 914089DA.


After inserting the code, make your way to Kurt, who lives in a house in the northwest corner of Azalea Town.
Talk to him and he will then take the GS Ball from you.
Kurt will then tell you that he will give it back the next day. Do so and retrieve the GS Ball from him.

, Now that you have the GS Ball, head straight to Ilex Forest as Kurt suggested. The forest is located in southern Johto, directly west of Azalea Town. Find the shrine, a small structure located within the Ilex Forest, and once you find it, approach the structure and put the GS Ball in the shrine. Celebi will then appear.


Catch Celebi like you would other Pokémon: decrease its HP or throw a Pokeball that has higher rate of capturing Pokémon without the need of halving its health.
The Celebi that appears will be level 30 and has the chance of capturing a Psychic or Grass-type.

Know that your specific Legendary Dog will only appear after certain conditions are met.,
Beat the Elite Four.,
Earn your national Pokédex by catching 60 types of Pokémon.,
Understand that the dogs move randomly.",How to Capture the Legendary Dogs in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen1," In order to keep you from running into the dogs when you are too weak to fight them, the Legendary Dogs will not enter the game until you have progressed near the end of the game. You will only be able to capture one dog per, and that depends on the Pokémon you started with:



Squirtle starters can capture lightning dog Raikou.

Bulbasaur starters can capture fire dog Entei.

Charmander starters can capture water dog Suicune.;
, The final bosses of the game, the Elite Four, must be conquered in order to reveal the Legendary Dogs. You can only fight the Elite Four after collecting every gym badge.


You will need several Pokémon around Level 50 to beat the Elite Four, and these Pokémon should be strong enough to capture the dogs too.
The Elite 4 covers a wide variety of Pokémon, and each of the 4 trainers has a specialty you need to counter:

Lorelei uses Ice and Water Pokémon. Counter with Fire, Fighting, Grass, and Electric Pokémon.

Bruno uses Fighting and Rock Pokémon. Counter with Flying, Psychic, Fighting, Steel, Grass, and Water Pokémon.

Agatha uses Poison Pokémon. Counter with Psychic and Ground Pokémon.

Lance uses Dragon Pokémon. Counter with Electric, Dragon, and Ice Pokémon.




, After you have caught or trained 60 unique Pokémon, Professor Oak will grant you the National Pokédex. Once you have this and the Elite Four are eliminated you will be able to find the dogs.


You must return to Professor Oak's house at the beginning of the game to get your national Pokédex., Unlike other Legendary Pokémon, the dogs do not appear in one set place and wait for you to find them. Every single time you enter a building, start a battle, or change regions the dog's location on the map will change, making them incredibly difficult to find. There are, however, some tricks to reveal them."

Before you insert the code, make sure that Kurt is not checking any Pokeball already.
Kurt will automatically give you a GS Ball, which you can use right away in the Ilex Shrine to capture Celebi.
Note: You can use this code as much as you want, but keep in mind that there will be a few resets whenever you do this.

, There will always be a reset whenever you use the codes for Celebi. In the Dragon Shrine, the master will give you another Dratini for unknown reasons but can easily be fixed by talking to him again. Just accept the Dratini, and he will be back to normal.


Another one is the girl in front of Sudowoodo. She will be standing there like before, and you have to talk to her to make the girl go away.
The man you encountered before who explained that there was something odd in the Underground Chamber that made him flee will say the exact thing again, as if it's the first time talking to you. To fix this, just talk to him once more, and he will be back to normal.
Aside from those resets, nothing majorly changed in the game.
After you obtained Celebi, make sure to save your progress.

Buy as many Ultra Balls as you can afford at a Poké Mart.,
Train several Pokémon up to level 55 or above.,
Make sure you have a Pokémon with a status-affecting move like Sleep or Paralysis.,
Bring along several Potions and Repels to keep your team healthy on the way on the way to Articuno.,
Know the HMs Strength and Surf.",How to Catch Articuno in Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green1," The closest one is at Fuchsia City, but you can buy them anywhere. While you could catch Articuno, theoretically, with any ball, the Ultra Ball has the highest chance of success.;
, Articuno is at level 50, and it will put up a good fight when it comes across you. Be prepared to chip away at its health with a few strong Pokemon.While you don't want to kill it before capture, a Fire and an Electric Pokémon will make powerful additions to your team here. Make sure you also have a strong, basic Pokemon, like a Normal type, to fight as well.

, Some of the of the best moves to have are Thunder Wave, Hypnosis, and/or Sleep Powder. These effects will greatly increase your ability to capture Articuno, as they up the percentages of a successful ball throw., You'll be making a decent sized trip to get to Articuno, and you don't want to be left with weak Pokémon when the fight begins. Bring Revives, TM Boosts, and Potions to make sure your team is in top shape when you arrive, or simply use Repels to avoid fighting wild Pokemon.

, You'll need both of them to reach Articuno, so don't attempt it until your have 1-2 Pokémon with the moves in your party.

Test the high grasses around Kanto.,
Purchase 10-20 Max Repels.,
Chose a Pokémon level 49 or lower as your starter.,
Walk through the grass for 10-20 seconds to search for the dogs.,
Walk indoors or into a new region if you cannot find the dog.,
Repeat this process of adding repel, checking the grass, and resetting location until you see the dog.,
Use your Pokédex to find the dogs again if you miss your chance.",How to Capture the Legendary Dogs in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen2," The dogs are found by walking through the high grass, just like any other Pokémon. Find a route with a lot of grass and weak Pokémon, such as Pewter City, Route 2, or Route 7, and start walking randomly through the small shrubs.You can also ride the bike to move around faster.

, Repels keep weak Pokémon from attacking you, but the Legendary Dogs will ignore it. This means that the only Pokémon you will encounter, if you encounter anything, is a Legendary Dog.


Max Repels work for roughly 250 paces before you need to use a new one., Go to your ""Team"" and set it so that your first Pokémon is lower than level 50. All of the dogs are level 50, and Max Repel scares away any Pokémon with a level even with or lower than your starter.Your best bet is to set a Level 49 Pokémon first. This way you will only find Pokémon level 50 and up, which only includes the dogs.

, Remember, the dogs move randomly each time you change regions. You can test the same patch of grass for hours, but if you do not ever change regions that the dog will stay where it is.

, The easiest place to do this is in the house on Route 2 above Viridian City. After you've checked the grass out front for 10-20 seconds, walk into the house and them leave immediately. This will force the dog to pick a new location, which is hopefully your little field of grass., Keep checking the grass with your Max Repel on until the dog appears. This may take some time, as the dog's location is chosen randomly. Remember, however, that the dog can move anywhere. You will need to be patient to get your chance.

, Once you see a Legendary Dog for the first time your Pokédex will automatically update the location of the dog after that. This makes it much easier to find it again if you cannot capture it the first time. Open your Pokédex, scroll down to the dog, and check the ""Area"" section to find it.If you accidentally KO the dog it will not appear again later in the game.
Remember, however, that as soon as you try to go to the dog's current location it will move. Check your Pokédex every time you enter a new area to see if it is in the same place as you.

"
"
Know that the Legendary Dogs are some of the hardest Pokémon to catch.,
Make sure you get to attack first by upping your Pokémon's speed.,
Use blocking attacks to immediately prevent the dog from escaping.,
Put the dog to sleep, freeze it, or paralyze it to make it easier to catch.,
Try to prevent the dog from using Roar.,
Weaken the dog until it has less than 10% of its health left.,
Use as many Ultra Balls as you can to capture the Pokémon.,
Alternatively, use your Master Ball on the very first turn.",How to Capture the Legendary Dogs in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen3," While powerful, the dogs will not be hard to defeat with a team of 6 Pokémon. The dogs, however, do not want to be caught, and will try to run from your the moment you encounter them. This makes them slippery and difficult to get a hold of permanently.


Any damage you do to a dog will last. If you run into them once and bring them to half health before they run, they will still be at half health the next time you see them., If you do not get the first turn the dog will likely run away before you do anything. To prevent this, make sure your opening Pokémon has enough speed to attack first. You can attach ""Quick Claw"" to ensure that your Pokémon attacks first as well. The go first, your speed rating needs to be higher than the dog's:



Suicune has a speed rating of 85.

Entei has a speed rating of 100.

Raikou has a speed rating of 115., Some Pokémon, such as Wobbuffet, have an ability named ""Shadow Tag"" that prevents a Pokémon from escaping at any time. Other Pokémon can use abilities like Mean Look, Block, and Arena Trap that keep the dog in place as long as the Pokémon is still in battle.


Attacks like Wrap and Fire Spin do damage over a few turns and will keep Pokémon from running. They will last for 3-5 turns before needing to be re-applied., These effects are often difficult to land, but when successful they will keep the dog from fleeing and make your capture balls more effective. Try moves like:


Sleep
Spore
Paralyze
Poison.

, This obnoxious attack shared by Entei and Raikou forces you to run away from the battle and the dog to disappear. While there is not a lot you can do to avoid it, putting the dog to sleep or paralyzing it will prevent it from using Roar against you.


The attack ""Taunt"" will negate the effects of Roar, but you need to use it your first turn to be effective., If you kill the dog you will be unable to capture it ever again. Use quick, effective moves like False Swipe and Night Shade to get their health down without causing massive damage.Don't ever gamble with a big attack -- if they run before you capture them they will reappear with the exact same health they left with. This means you can take your time.

, Every time a ball misses the Pokémon becomes a little easier to capture, so don't be disheartened if the first few fail. You can put the animal back to sleep or paralyze it to make capturing even easier.


You will likely need 50 or more Ultra Balls to succeed. You would rather have them, after all, than run out of them when you need them.
Timer Balls, which gain power the longer the battle goes on, reach their peak performance after 25 turns. Use your Ultra Balls to weaken the Pokémon, then launch your Timer Balls later in the battle to use them effectively., Using the Master Ball is the simplest way to catch a difficult Pokémon because it is impossible to miss. Once you've met the dog, forget about trapping it or lowering its health -- immediately throw the Master Ball. This is a guaranteed method of catching your legendary dog.


Remember, however, that you only get one Master Ball in the game. That said, this is one of the perfect places to use it.

Use Surf off of the Southern coast of Fuschia City.,
Surf down and to the left until you reach a small cave.,
Drop the two boulders in the cave through the holes in the floor using HM Strength.,
Head down to the lowest level once you've pushed all the boulders through.,
Surf down the river until you reach Articuno.",How to Catch Articuno in Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green2," Once you're situated with Pokémon and Ultra Balls, head down to the bottom-most end of Fuscia City and hop in the water.

, You'll be going southwest. Start by going straight down until you get stuck, then turn hard to the left to reach the Seafoam Islands, the home of Articuno. You'll see a little cave that you need to enter.


There are two entrances to this cave, but only this entrance will work to get Articuno., When you enter, there will be a small boulder next to a hole in the floor. Use Strength to push the boulder through the hole. Off to the left, on the same floor, is another boulder that needs to be pushed through as well. Without leaving that floor, push that boulder the whole near it as well. Then return to the first hole and drop through along with the boulders.


Do not use the ladder in the cave, as it will reset your boulders.
The boulders halt the current in the lower levels of the cave, allowing you to surf on the river and find Articuno.

, Keep pushing the boulders down the holes until you're at the lowest level of the cave. There will be a river with two boulders blocking it off, slowing it down enough to surf on.


If you try and surf on this water without getting the boulders placed you will be swept away and out of the cave.

, It will be sitting on a small, raised platform, and will be clearly visible from the water. You won't fight it until you talk to it."
"
Save the game before ""talking"" to Articuno.,
Lower Articuno's HP down to the red zone.,
Put it to sleep or paralyze it once you have its health in the red.,
Throw Ultra Balls at it until it is caught.",How to Catch Articuno in Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green3," If you miss this chance to catch the bird, you will not get another one. Avoid this mishap by saving before you click on the bird. Approaching and hitting A will trigger the fight, so prepare your team and save before starting., Fight the Pokémon like you'd fight any other you wanted to catch. When possible, use moves that deal damage but aren't super effective, as you don't want to unintentionally knock the bird out. Normal moves like Slash are good, as are moves like False Swipe. To help you capture the bird, remember it's strengths and weaknesses:



Weak Against: Fire, Electric, Rock (x2, so be careful with Rock attacks), and Steel.

Strong Against: Grass, Ground, Bug, and Dragon., Once you've weakened it enough, it's time to slow it down and make it easier to catch. Obviously, the lower the health you can get it to the better, but don't risk knocking it out if your attacks are hitting strongly. Use Sleep Powder, Paralysis, Thunder Wave to ensure that Articuno is lulled out of combat, making it easier to catch., Even if an Ultra Ball fails, it makes the next one slightly more likely to succeed. That means you 10th attempt at catching the bird will be far more likely to succeed that the last. Keep Articuno paralyzed or asleep and you'll scoop it up in no time.

Know what to expect.,
Build a team with Pokémon that are strong against Rock/Ground types.,
Consider your starting Pokémon (Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur).,
Try not to use Pokémon that are weak against Rock types.,
Consider going up against Brock with the following team:


Bulbasuar or Squirtle level 14 (starter Pokémon); you can also train him to level 16, at which point Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur and Squirtle evolves into Wartortle.,
Get through Viridian Forest.,
Train your starter Pokémon to level 14.,
Train a Rattata.,
Catch Caterpie and train it to level 10.,
Catch Mankey and train it until it knows Karate Chop (which it learns at level 11).,
Catch Nidoran (male or female) and train it to level 12.,
Train until you have a strong, diverse party.,
Heal your Pokémon before you enter the gym.,
Enter Brock's gym in Pewter City.,
Save the game before you challenge Brock.,
Challenge Brock.,
Start with a Pokémon that is strong against Rock types.,
Get TM39.,
Continue your adventure.",How to Beat the First Gym Leader in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen," The first Gym Leader, Brock, can be easy or relatively difficult to beat depending on which Pokémon types you have in your party. In FireRed and LeafGreen, Brock has two Pokémon: a level 12 Geodude with Tackle and Defense Curl, and a level 14 Onix with Tackle, Bind, Harden and Rock Tomb. Brock is an especially challenging fight because both of his Pokémon have defense-raising moves (Defense Curl and Harden). Your Pokémon will mostly be able to use basic physical attacks early in the game, so the battle could get progressively harder depending on how many times Brock's Geodude and Onix are able to use Defense Curl and Harden.


Brock's Geodude only has one attack: the Normal-type attack Tackle. This means that any Pokémon should be able to knock him out if it also has a normal type attack.;
, Know which Pokémon types are strong against Rock types. You will want to stack your team with Pokémon of these types:


Water
Grass
Ice
Ground
Fighting
Steel

, The battle to come will be easier if you chose Bulbasaur or Squirtle, and it will be harder—though by no means impossible—if you chose Charmander.


The easiest way to beat Brock is to choose Bulbasaur or Squirtle as your starter—both Water and Grass attacks do 2x damage against Brock's Rock/Ground-type Pokémon. As a bonus, Squirtle's early-game Water-type move, Water Gun, is a Special move, meaning that it won't be weakened by Brock's Pokémons' high Defense stats.
If you chose Charmander as your starter, you may have a difficult fight—Fire types are notably weak against Rock types. You may support your Charmander with Pokémon that are strong against Rock types: Mankey (Fighting type) and/or Rattata (Normal type, but does not take 2x damage from Rock attacks).

, Catching a Pidgey (Flying type), Caterpie, Weedle, Kakuna, Metapod (Bug types), and/or a Pikachu (Electric type) will make your team stronger in the long run, but it will only help you so much in this battle: Rock types do 2x as much damage against Fire, Flying, and Bug types.


A team that includes Charmander, Pidgey, Caterpie, Weedle, Kakuna, Metapod, and/or Pikachu can still battle Brock and win, as long as they are of high enough levels or you carry them in great enough numbers.
Pikachu will be very useful against the second Gym Leader, but he will not help you much against Brock. Although neither of Brock's Pokémon have a Ground-type move (which would do 2x damage against Pikachu) he will not be able to do any damage in the battle: both Geodude and Onix are immune to Electric attacks due to their secondary Ground type.

,
Butterfree level 12 (evolves from Caterpie and Metapod, which are found in Viridian Forest)
Mankey level 12 (found on Route 3 near Pokémon league—west of Viridian City)
Pikachu level 10 (found in Viridian Forest. Pikachu won't be much use against Brock, but he will come in handy for the next gym. Pikachu is very rare, so you will need to spend some serious time walking around the tall grass of Viridian Forest). (Also consider raising the Pikachu to level 26 before the second gym to learn a more powerful Electric type move)
Pidgey level 10 (found on Route 2, on the way from Pallet Town to Viridian City. Pidgey knows sand attack, which will drop Brock's Geodude and Onix's accuracy way down).
Nidoran level 12 (Later, you can evolve him to Nidoking for a serious power Pokémon).

, Brock's gym is in Pewter City, so you will need to make it there if you want to battle Brock. Make sure to heal all of your Pokémon at a Pokémon Center before you go, and make sure to bring a few Pokéballs. While you're in the forest, take the opportunity to catch a Caterpie, a Pikachu, and perhaps even a Weedle.

, You will need to walk around in tall grass and fight every wild Pokémon that you encounter—even if it's only level 3. Fight any trainer that you meet. Keep battling wild Pokémon until your Pokémon are close to fainting, then get to a Pokémon Center before it's too late. Train your starter until it learns its powerful type-specific moves:


If you chose Bulbasaur or Squirtle as your starter Pokémon, then you're in luck. By the time you face Brock, they should naturally learn moves that are strong against Rock types: Razor Leaf and Vine Whip (level 7) for Bulbasaur, and Bubblebeam (level 7) and Water Gun for Squirtle.
If you chose Charmander, you might have a tougher time beating Brock. However, Charmander can do okay with its Ember attack. You can also train Charmander to level 13, when it learns Metal Claw; Metal Claw is a Steel-type move, and thus is super effective against Rock-type Pokémon.
If you train your Charmander to level 16, when it evolves into Charmeleon, it may be strong enough to hold its own against Brock. The same goes for Bulbasaur and Squirtle, which evolve into Ivysaur and Wartortle at level 16. However, it is not always wise to rely on just one Pokémon.

, If you chose Charmander, it is a good idea to train a Rattata: Normal types deal 1/2x damage and take 1x damage against Rock and Ground types, which will make the fight a bit easier for you. You can catch a Rattata in tall grass

, At level 7 it will evolve into a Metapod and learn Harden. At level 10, Caterpie evolves into its final stage, Butterfree, and learns Confusion. Confusion is a powerful attack for such a low level, and having it in your roster will give you a much easier time beating Brock. Confusion is not super effective against Brock's Pokémon, but it will deal a significant amount of damage.


You can find Caterpie and Metapod by walking around in the tall grass within Viridian Forest. It is a good idea to catch a Caterpie instead of a Metapod: Caterpie naturally knows Tackle—an attack move—whereas wild Metapod only know Harden (a purely defensive move).

, A level 11 Mankey can take out Brock's level 14 Onix in two turns. Karate Chop is a Fighting-type move—super effective against Brock's Pokémon—so you should be able to easily win with it.


If you have trouble with Brock's Onix only, then you just need to raise Mankey until it learns Low Kick. Mankey usually learns Low Kick at level 9, but there is a chance that it will learn the move at level 6. This move is helpful against Onix because the heavier the foe, the greater the damage.
You can find Mankey on Route 22—on the way to Victory Road—which is off to the left side of the screen when you are in Viridian City. Keep following this path until you come to a patch of tall grass. Note: You will need to battle your rival here, so make sure to bring your strongest Pokémon.

, You do not absolutely need a Nidoran, but it will be more useful than, say, a Pidgey or a Pikachu. You can find Nidoran in the same areas that you can find Mankey: on Route 22, when you walk west/left-of-the-screen from Viridian City. Nidoran eventually evolves into Nidorino or Nidorina (depending on the gender) and then Nidoking or Nidoqueen, which are two of the most powerful Pokémon in the game.

, You should at least have a level 12 Mankey, a level 14 Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander, and/or a level 12 Butterfree. It wouldn't hurt to have a level 12 Nidoran or Rattata. When you think your team is strong enough, you are ready to battle Brock and win your first badge.

, Visit a Pokémon Center and make sure that all of the Pokémon in your party are at full health. Stock up on potions—you can buy them at any PokéMart. You can use a potion to heal any Pokémon by 20 HP in the midst of battle; the act of healing takes the place of an attack turn. This is a great way to give yourself extra insurance when you face Brock.

, Battle and defeat the first trainer that you encounter. You need to beat this trainer in order to get to Brock. This fight should give you an idea of what you will encounter when you face Brock: both trainers use only Rock-type Pokémon, although Brock's team is stronger. Once you beat this first trainer, go heal your Pokémon one last time before you challenge Brock. You want your team to be in top fighting shape.


If you don't beat this first trainer, then you aren't ready to beat Brock. Go train your Pokémon until they are stronger.

, You should save the game before you enter any Gym Leader battle—or any important battle, for that matter. This way, you can always start over and try again if you mess up.

, When you have trained your team, beaten the first Gym trainer, saved the game, and brought all of your Pokémon to full health, you are ready to battle Brock. Walk to the figure standing in the center of the Gym, and talk to him. He will say a few words, and then the battle will begin. Brock will send out Geodude first, and then Onix.

, Attack quickly and efficiently before Brock's Geodude and Onix have the chance to use their defense-boosting moves; the more times they boost their Defense stats, the harder it will be to beat them. Use the Pokémon and attacks that are most effective against Rock/Ground types. Use potions, if necessary, to keep your strongest Pokémon in the fight.


If you have Pokémon that are strong against Rock types, use their type-specific moves. Have Bulbasaur use Vine Whip and Razor Leaf; have Squirtle use Bubblebeam and Water Gun; have Mankey use Low Kick and Karate Chop. If these Pokémon have reached high enough levels, they should make short work of Brock.
If you have a Pidgey, repeatedly use Sand Attack to weaken the accuracy of Brock's Geodude and Onix—this will make their attacks less likely to hit. Pidgey will stand no chance against Geodude; the goal here is to make it easier for your other Pokémon to dominate the battle. Just use Sand Attack as much as possible.

, When you beat Brock, he will give you TM39, which you can use to teach one of your Pokémon the move Rocktomb. This is a solid Rock-type move that lowers the opponent's speed on contact. Save this TM until you catch a Rock-type Pokémon (such as Geodude or Onix) that will be able to use the move effectively.

, Once you beat Brock, there is nothing important left for you to do in Pewter City. Leave the city along the road to the east/right-of-the-screen. Walk onward toward Mt. Moon, which takes you to Cerulean City, and continue with the rest of your adventure.

",How to Beat the Gym Leaders in Pokémon Fire Red," You should have a starting team that is like this: Starter, Pikachu, Spearow/Pidgey, Mankey, Beedrill/Butterfree, and another Pokémon.;
, Your Pokémon should be level 9 or more. This is a good chance to level up a weakling or two. Use Metal Claw if you have Charmander, Bubble or Water Gun if you have Squirtle, or Vine Whip if you have Bulbasaur.

, Also, your Pokémon should be around 20 to 25 (Bulbasaur or Pikachu).

, You can find a Diglett in the nearby Diglett's Cave. You can even use Dugtrio! Also, your Pokémon should be in the late 20's.

, If you picked Charmander, than you've got nothing to worry about! If you chose Squirtle or Bulbasaur you can use a Pidgey or Pidgeotto, or use a Spearow or Fearow. Otherwise use a Fire-type (Vulpix, Flareon, Growlithe, Arcanine, Ninetales).

, Either that or a very powerful Pokémon. If you're using a Ground-type, be aware that Koffing and Weezing have the Levitate ability, preventing you from using Ground-type moves against them.

, Or you could evolve Weedle up into Beedrill, who knows Pin Missile (Jolteon also learns this move). If this fails, use a Pokémon with a strong physical move. Kadabra and Alakazam may have a high special attack and speed stat, but they don't fare well against physical attacks due to their low defense stat. Pokémon such as Fearow and Snorlax are good physical attackers.

,, You could also bring a Psychic-type to deal with Nidoking and Nidoqueen.

, If you're battling in the Wi-Fi Battle Tower, you get 3 Pokémon; in this case, a hard-hitting offensive approach is a good idea. If you're doing a Friend Battle, you get 6 Pokémon, so this offers more variety.

,, The best one out there is Kyogre; its rain-boosted Water Spout does more damage than most any other attack. Wobbuffet is another good choice, utilizing Encore, Shadow Tag, and Counter Coat to trap and KO attackers or switch out and set up on supporters.

,, This is more useful in Ubers, as most Kyogre cannot touch it).

,).

, Also, the user, regardless of Special Ability, will be unaffected).

, A Tyranitar, obtainable only by Diamond. A Salamence, Obtainable only by Pearl, but that's arguably Uber, etc.

, If that person uses a Arceus and you are using a Uxie with 45 HP, and all other Pokémon are fainted, don't disconnect! Run like a man and acknowledge your defeat.

, Newcomers will, for example, switch a Gliscor in to wall Lucario only to be one-shot by Ice Punch. Likewise, switching a Garchomp in on a Magnezone won't do much good if it Magnet Rises to dodge Earthquake and subsequently Explodes.

, This is often exploited by using two Pokémon together; Gyarados lures in Thunder and switches to Electivire, whose Motor Drive blocks the attack, boosts its Speed, and allows it to sweep. Likewise, Scizor lures in a Flamethrower and switches to Heatran, who takes the attack with its Flash Fire and mauls everything with boosted Fire Blasts.

, For example, if your opponent likes to switch their Gyarados in on your Garchomp to dodge Earthquake and weaken you with Intimidate, use Stone Edge on your opponent's Electrics to catch Gyarados with a super-effective hit. Protect, Baton Pass, and U-Turn are useful for this sort of thing.

, For example, if your opponent's Exeggutor is using Solar Beam, and it's their first turn charging, switch to a Grass resist like Salamence, set up a Dragon Dance or two, and wreck their team. Or, predict the attack, switch in Tyranitar to cut the move's power in half, and take out Exeggutor with Crunch.

Catch Arceus.",How to Capture Arceus in Pokémon Diamond or Pokémon Pearl," This is the only legitimate way to get an Arceus in Diamond or Pearl. Arceus was available for a limited time as a reward for attending a Nintendo event in 2009 and 29010. It is now no longer possible to get an Arceus unless you trade for one or cheat to get one.


Since Arceus is super rare, you'll likely need to offer up some big names to get your hands on one. Get ready to trade your most valued Pokemon, including Landorus or Deoxys. Shiny Legendary Pokémon such as a Shiny Mew can also make good trade offers.;
, If you can't trade for an Arceus, the only other option is to cheat to get it. You can use an Action Replay to cheat on your DS system, or you can use an emulator's built-in cheat tools to cheat when playing on your computer.


You can transfer your save file from your DS to a computer (and vice versa) by using a flash cart like an R4 or Cyclo. See Mod a Nintendo DS with an R4 Flashcart for details on using a flash cart to access your DS files.

, You'll need this in order to use the special item that gives you access to Arceus, even if you cheat for it. You can complete the National Pokedex by beating the Elite Four and seeing all 150 Pokémon from the Sinnoh Pokedex. You don't need to capture all 150, just encounter them.


See Select the Best Pokémon to Beat the Elite Four in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl for tips on building the best Pokémon party to take on the Elite Four.

, The process for adding codes varies depending on if you're using an actual Action Replay or an emulator:


Action Replay - Plug the Action Replay cart into your DS, and then plug the Pokémon cart into the Action Replay. Start Action Replay and tap the Code Select button. Tap ""<Add New Code>"" to enter in your code.
Emulator (DeSmuME) - Start the Pokémon ROM file in your Emulator. Click the ""Tools"" menu, select ""Cheats,"" and then ""List."" Click the ""Action Replay"" button to enter a new code.

, This item is required to get to the island where Arceus can be found. Enter the following code into either the ""<Add New Code>"" section of your Action Replay, or into the Code field on your emulator. Click ""Add"" or ""Save"" after entering the code:, After adding the code, you'll see it in your list of codes. It will usually be enabled automatically after adding it, but double-check to make sure it is selected.

, After loading the cheat, play your game as normal. Head to the nearest Pokemart, but don't go inside yet.

, This will activate the code you entered after a moment.

, You should see a green man that isn't normally there.

, The green man appears during special events, which you triggered using the code above. He'll hand you the Azure Flute, which you'll be using to find Arceus.


The benefit of using this code as opposed to cheating to get an Arceus directly is that it will obey your commands and will be treated as a ""legitimate"" Pokémon since it doesn't have any hacked values.

, You'll have to fight Arceus before you can capture it, and Arceus is Level 80. This means it will be one of the toughest fights you encounter in the entire game. Make sure your team is up to the task, and that you have a large selection of Poke Balls to throw at it.


You may want to consider using your Master Ball on Arceus to capture it instantly.
Having a Pokémon with False Swipe can make it easier to lower Arceus's health without knocking it out. Having a Pokémon with Sleep or Paralyze can make Arceus easier to catch as well.

, Coronet. You'll be using the Azure Flute here to access Arceus.

, You can find this at the top of Mt. Coronet.

, When you reach the Spear Pillar, the game will prompt you to play the Azure Flute. When you use the Azure Flute in front of the Spear Pillar, a staircase will appear, allowing you to enter the Hall of Origins. You'll find Arceus inside.

, Saving right before the fight will make it easy to reload in case you accidentally knock out Arceus or you get wiped out.


If you enter the room before saving, you'll automatically start the fight and won't be able to save.

, You'll approach automatically when you enter the room. Use your strongest Pokémon to whittle down Arceus's health until it's red. Use False Swipe as the health gets low so that you can lower its health further without knocking it out.

, Once Arceus's health is in the red, start putting it to sleep or paralyzing it. Once it's asleep or paralyzed, you can start throwing Ultra Balls at it. Keep trying, even if it keeps breaking free. Eventually, you should be able to catch it.


If you accidentally knock Arceus out, or all of your Pokémon are knocked out, you can load your save and try again.

Deposit a piece of junk, and ask for a slightly better piece of junk (AKA unobtainable starter).,

Get a Gen 4 trade evolver.,
It's finally time to get your first legendary.,
Get a repeatable mascot legendary.,
Now, with a mascot in hand, trade for anything you want, as long as it can be traded.,
Get the stats you want.",How to GTS Barter for What You Want," For this step, one can trade a Budew for a Mudkip. Mudkip is nearly worthless at Level 1 because It can be obtained so easily by breeding a Swampert you get from Pokémon Bank. However, since mudkip is not found through normal gameplay, someone who wants to complete the dex without a B/W or B2/W2 game will want a basic to get the ball rolling. That's why you start small.;
, For this, trade the Mudkip for a Cloyster. Cloyster's Skill link ability is desired by competitive players, but it is also available to be caught (though rare) in Cyllage city while fishing. With some luck, someone looking for dex filler will trade your starter for an OU. Kadabra is a good choice for this trade because then you can offer an Alakazam in your next trade.

, Trade the Cloyster for a Charizard in this step. Charizard is easily obtainable in game, and if you advertise its ""good moves"" in the message box you can find a trader pretty quickly.

, Trade the Charizard for a Tyranitar in this step. Tyranitar is easily obtainable in game by evolving Pupitar, and Mega Tyranitar is a meta wrecker with sand stream and awesome defense. Other candidates for this trade are Aggron, garchomp, and maybe dragonite although it has no Mega.

, For example, trade the Tyranitar for a Goodra. Goodra is a pseudo legendary and can only evolve at level 40 if its raining naturally. Since casual players are too lazy to wait for rain, you will get a trade quick from the people who are impatient in the next step.

, All five of these, (Electrivire, Magmortar, rhyperior, Dusknoir, and porygon-Z) are fairly useful competitive Pokémon,and they are in high demand because they need special items, ones requiring BP, to evolve. Trade Goodra for Rhyperior because Rhyperior, long story short, is a boss. Don't ask for the pre-evolution thinking someone will give it that held item. They might not.

, Trade your trade evolver for a legendary trio Pokémon that someone would most likely have multiple of, AKA anything catchable as repeats in B2/W2. This means the Lake spirits, Forces of Nature, or Swords of Justice (look 'em up). Rhyperior was traded for a Virizion, and it was pretty awesome to see this thing coming in from a Budew. But we're not done.

, A mascot legendary is the one that shows up on the box. Every mascot legendary is repeatable due to the vast amounts of special events for each one, so this can actually be the easiest step yet. However, It's best to start with one That's more common and weak, AKA NOT DIALGA, PALKIA, GIRATINA, HO-OH, LUGIA, or RAYQUAZA. Don't get those until the next step. Everything else is pretty much fair game. Virizon was traded for a Yveltal here.

, Any Pokémon received in a special event cannot be traded over GTS, so don't waste your time trying to get Arceus, Deoxys, Jirachi, Victini, etc. The final trade was Yveltal for Kyogre.

, This is the longest and most boring part of the bartering if you're not lucky. If you're lucky and got a beautiful perfect Kyogre on the first try, good for you! But you may not be nearly as lucky on your following barters. This is just alternating trades for two legendaries, over and over and over again. But if you're just trying to get dex filler for these, you don't need to worry about this step. Well That's all! Now enjoy your new legendary that you just got from a piece of junk!

",How to Give Gifts in Dragon Age," The first approval rating is +5, and all subsequent gifts will go down by one point until you only gain +1 for a gift.


If you give a character a gift specific to their interests or to a story they tell you, you will get +10 for the first gift. Every subsequent gift will go down a point. For example, if the first gift you give Allister is Duncan’s Shield, his approval will be +10. If the next gift is his mother’s amulet, his approval will be +9.
However, if you give him a generic gift first, when you give Allister Duncan’s Shield, the approval will be +9. Then, if you give him another generic gift, the approval rating will be +3. By the time you give Allister the amulet, the approval will only be +7.
If a character has 100% approval rating, gifts will have no effect.;
, If a party member has negative feelings toward you, the approval rating from gifts will be halved.

, The best way to learn what gifts go with which party member is to spend time talking to each of them.


For example, one of the stories Morrigan tells is of her stealing a mirror and how Flemeth smashed it. Over the course of the game, you will find a Golden Mirror that you can give to Morrigan as one of her special gifts. This is also a plot gift, so it will trigger a cutscene allowing to you can see that Morrigan is really touched by the gift.

, Other gifts are less special, but still very much appreciated. Like the sweets Dog finds can be given to Sten for higher approval points, or the Etched Silver Symbol for Leliana.


Sten loves sweets, which you find out through conversation and one particular cut scene if he is in your party when you are preparing to cross over to the Tower.
Leliana also talks about pretty things that she likes in several of the conversations you have with her. All of Oghren’s gifts are alcohol-related, different types of brews and ales. The more elegant alcohols, like wine, are special gifts for other party members.

, If the character is not in your current party, you can change your party to include the character.


You can also give gifts to your party in camp. This is particularly helpful when you give a plot gift because they trigger a cutscene, and you don’t want to be in the middle of a battle when that happens.

, Depending on the console you’re using, the buttons will vary:


LT for Xbox360
L2 for PS3

, Every time you scroll over, another character will fill the left side of the screen, and their name will appear over their image. Stop when you see the party member you want to give a present to.

,, Watch the space under the character for a +. This tells you how many points you have earned with that character by giving the gift. The party member will also thank you for the gift in his own way.

Build a Town Hall.,
Build a House or Boarding House.,
Build a Market.,
Build a Trading Post.,
Build a Hospital.,
Add more Farmers.,
Add more Fishermen.,
Control the Population.,
Build Chapels or Tavern.,
Build a Cemetery.",How to Get Nomads in Banished," The town hall is an administrative building in the game; it is where you see the records and ledgers of the town’s status, as well as the population, resources amount, food reserves, and other population data as it changes over the years. You also be able to see the current information about your citizen such as jobs, health, happiness, education, food production and many more.


To build a Town Hall, you need 64 Logs, 124 Stone and 48 Iron, labor required is 160.
Town Hall building size is 10 x 8;
, Accepting nomads requires you to build them Houses or Boarding Houses to give them a place to stay and will serve as their temporary home. Even if you have Boarding House, you still have to build houses for them as their permanent home.


To build a Boarding House, you need 100 Logs, 45 Stone and 150 Labor. Keep in mind that Boarding Houses can only hold 5 families.
To build a Wooden House, you need 16 Logs, 8 Stones and 10 worth of Labor.
To build a Stone House, you need 24 Logs, 40 Stones, 10 Iron and 10 worth of Labor. Note:

, Market is also needed in order to attract nomads; it acts as a distributor of resources for your citizens, where they can collect items such as food and firewood to bring to their homes. Your citizens will no longer travel far just to get to the stockpile or storage house to get the supplies they needed.


A market has a range of 90 squares; every citizen within this range will prefer to get goods from the market instead of traveling far.
To build a Market, you need 58 logs, 62 stones, 40 irons, and 100 worth of labor.
The more vendors you assign working in the Market, the more food, tools, and materials they will distribute.

, A Trading Post is a useful building where merchants make trades with you; they will offer food, resources, livestock and new types of seeds. Any sort of money is not available in this game; you need to make a resource exchange in order for you to purchase.


Building a Trading Post requires 62 Logs, 80 Stones, 40 Iron and 140 worth of labor. You must build the trading post in a large river with access to the map border in order of the merchants to reach it.

, At this point, you must built a Hospital for your people as soon as you can; nomads may carry diseases from other part of the world and these diseases may spread and cause death to your citizens. If you have herbalist, the herbs they have gathered will be more effective.


To build a Hospital, you need 52 Logs, 78 Stones, 32 Iron and 150 worth of labor. Each hospital can accommodate 30 patients.
You can only assign 1 physician.
If you have huge population, it's advisable that build more hospital.

, Since Nomads are uneducated upon entering your town, they will be dragging your educated citizens down, making the production low and slow. Also, adding nomad in your town means that the food reservation will be lowered due to the fact that you have more adults now.


To avoid starvation, build more farms and assign the nomads to work as farmer. Make sure to fill in all the vacant job to get the fastest and best production of crops.
If nomads have children, you don't have to worry about them. Children will attend the school like everybody else.

, If you still have jobless nomads at this point, build a fishing dock and assign them to catch fish. Citizens working in fishing docks, unlike farmers, won't stop catching for food even during winter season.


To build a Fishing Dock, you need 30 logs, 16 stones and 45 worth of labor.
Compared to Trading Post, you can build fishing dock in a close body of water. Though, as year passes, fish may become instinct.
Educated workers are preferred to work as builders, woodcutter and gatherer since they produce more, compared to uneducated citizens.

, As your town grow, more nomads will arrive in your town with more than 30 people. Remember, every population added in your town requires more food and firewood; you also need houses for them which requires materials.


Accepting nomads will be able to help you fill in vacant jobs, but the downfall is that they might have diseases and will lower your supplies. Deny any request if you're unsure.
If you really want to add more people in your town, best to prepare your supplies first. Gather more logs, make more firewood; produce more food, tools and clothing.

, Happiness is important in maintaining a huge town; build chapels or tavern to keep them happy. Unhappy citizens work less and produce small food or materials. Though tavern requires ale to effectively work, it can be created with the use of orchards products such as Apples, Pears, Cherries.


To build a Chapel, you need 50 logs, 130 stones, 30 iron and 150 worth of labor.
To build a Tavern, you need 52 logs, 12 stones, 20 iron and 90 worth of labor.
You can get orchard seeds from traders. If you don't have any orchards, producing ale with wheat works as well.

, Now that you have a huge population, old citizens may die at the same time and the result of their death are unhappy members of the family. Members of the family may stop working then go back toward normal happiness after a few years.


Townsfolk living near a cemetery get a happiness boost.
To build a cemetery you need 1 stone per unit area. The maximum size of the cemetery is 20 units long.
Tombstones will eventually decay and disappear after approximately a generation, allowing the reuse of cemetery plots.

Use Siege Giants to break down forts from afar.,
Use Bruisers to apply more pressure on a lane while draining ammunition from defensive structures.,
Capture Boss Golems to punish enemy teams that cannot react fast enough.,
Kill all mercenaries in the camp.,
Capture the camp with your hero.,
Decide whether to escort the mercenaries or do something else.",How to Get Mercenaries in Heroes of the Storm," These mercenaries come in twos and are some of the easiest mercenaries to deal with. Capture them, and they will march down a lane to deal long-ranged, high-damage attacks that deal splash damage to nearby targets. They also have the added benefit of being able to shoot far enough that towers, forts and keeps cannot retaliate – allowing them to demolish these structures if left unopposed.

Khazra come in threes and replace Siege Giants in the Diablo-themed Battlefields of Eternity and Infernal Shrines. They don’t do splash damage, but they attack much faster than their regular counterparts while doing bonus to non-heroic units and structures.;
, These can be found in camps containing three melee knights and one ranged wizard. They are much harder than Giants to capture thanks to their high health pool and respectable damage output. This also means that towers, forts and keeps will have to eat up a lot of their ammunition to deal with them – making it easier for subsequent pushes should these defensive structures run out of ammo. And that’s not mentioning the actual damage the four mercenaries can dish out on their own, which can often push a lane all the way to the core if left unopposed.

Fallen Shamans replace Bruisers in the Diablo-themed Infernal Shrines and Battlefields of Eternity. There is one shaman that uses ranged attacks in each camp accompanied by two infernal hounds. These shamans are particularly adept at pushing lanes because they keep summoning their infernal hounds whenever they fall – although they don’t resummon these hounds while you’re battling them respective mercenary camps.

, These are the biggest, baddest mercenaries you can capture. Not all maps contain Boss Golem camps and there is only one Boss Golem per camp, but that one golem does a lot of damage with each swing while also possessing a huge amount of health. It can also slam the ground to stun nearby players and lay down roots that will damage and root ranged heroes. If left unchecked, a Boss Golem can literally break down a complete fortress - even a keep - almost all by itself. The high health and high damage of the Boss Golem, however, means that you’ll need about three or four heroes to take it down – five if you want to do so quickly. This makes you particularly vulnerable to ambushes while fighting Boss Golems, so be very careful in choosing when to make the attempt., This one is pretty straightforward: get to the mercenary camp, start hitting them and wait until they die. Stay close to draw the attention of mercenaries, and stay far so that they will switch targets. Mercenaries will prefer minions and summoned monsters over heroes as well, meaning that heroes with the ability to summon minions (e.g. Zagara, Rehgar, Azmodan etc.) will be quite useful for capturing mercenary camps.

Using the Bribe talent will instantly neutralize one mercenary per charge, and will work against all mercenaries except Boss Golems. You will need to store up charges for the talent though, which is only gained by staying near enemy minions as they die.
Heroes with the Scouting Drone talent, Clairvoyance talent or other abilities that give vision (e.g. summoned minions, Zagara’s Creep Tumors, Tyrande’s Sentinel, Tassadar’s Oracle etc.) can use these to protect their flanks while capturing mercenary camps. This is especially useful when capturing Boss Golems, as the advance warning can help prevent your team from getting ambushed by the enemy team.
You can also use summoned minions to scout around while you are engaging the mercenaries in combat. They usually walk toward the nearest lane, so you can place them in such a way that they will give you as much vision as they can en route to their lane.

, You can kill the mercenaries using abilities or summoned minions (e.g. Zagara’s roaches, Azmodans demons, Gazlowe’s turrets etc.), but a hero needs to stand within the capture circle for a few seconds to actively capture camp. Walking out of this circle will reset the capture time, and you can leave the camp to capture it later on as you will. Cleared camps, however, will be indicated by a unique icon on the mini-map that is visible to all players in the match - so you had better guard that camp or capture it quickly if you don’t want your enemies to steal the camp from you.

Getting Bribe significantly cuts down the time you need to capture mercenary camps. In the case of Siege Giant camps, you could practically capture them in the blink of an eye. This lets you steal mercenary camps that are located near the enemy team’s base – depriving them of mercenaries while forcing them to deal with a threat from behind.
If you walk in on an enemy hero that has just cleared a mercenary camp, contest it by walking into the capture circle. The circle will stay neutral as long as at least one hero from the opposing teams are on top of it.
Zagara’s Devouring Maw, Zeratul’s Void Prison and Stitches’ Gorge can temporarily put enemy heroes out of the game – giving you a short window of time to capture the camp. These skills make it possible for you to “ninja steal” those camps, which is particularly useful with Boss Golem camps.
Each of the maps in Heroes of the Storm will have an objective that will force both teams to contest them, like gathering skulls in the Haunted Mines or tributes in Cursed Hollow. These objectives will usually take some time before they appear on the map, and capturing camps just before the objectives spawn will force the enemy team to make a choice: capture the objective and let the mercenaries go on a rampage, or send someone to deal with the mercenaries while losing their aid in the fight for the objective. Both are desirable situations for your team, so make sure to capture the camps during these times to make the most of captured mercenaries., Once you have neutralized the mercenaries and capture the camp, you will have to make a choice. One, you accompany the mercenaries to protect them and help them deal maximum damage. This is best done when your hero is an assassin or specialist that can deal a lot of damage to minions and enemy bases. Two, you leave the mercenaries alone and focus on something else - like pushing another lane or assisting your allies. This is best chosen when the objective is up and your team needs your assistance to beat back the enemy team. You can also push a separate lane if the enemy team is completely absorbed on the objective and is not paying your or your mercenaries any attention.

The Mercenary Lord talent is invaluable if you choose to escort your mercenaries. This talent causes nearby non-Golem mercenaries to deal 50% more damage while receiving 50% less damage from non-heroic sources.The added damage and survivability for nearby minions can sometimes even be worth skipping out on helping capture an objective, especially if the rest of your teammates are holding their own against the entire enemy team. This gives you the opportunity to blast down forts and even keeps while your teammates keep the other team busy by stalling for as much time as possible.
On the other hand, using Bribe to instantly down two mercenaries at once (or even three if you pick certain heroes like Raynor that have enhanced versions of Bribe) is of great help when timing your captures. You’ll be able to join the fight for the objective much more quickly – making Bribe especially useful for surprising the enemy team by suddenly unleashing mercenaries and then popping back in to join the team fight.

Marathon: A Tetris player can't be called a Tetris player unless they've played Marathon at least once in their lifetime.,
Sprint: Now that Marathon has been explained, all other game modes of Tetris are based off of this.,
Survival: Survival is just like Marathon, in that you have to clear lines to get to the next level.,
Ultra: This mode is also a fairly classic mode of Tetris, and back in the day, the only two modes available were this and, of course, Marathon.,
Sprint 5-Player: This is going to be a mode that you will play a lot in the beginning, and then maybe leave later on.",How to Get Better at Tetris," In certain versions of Tetris, a T-Spin will count for extra points. (Don't worry, it's easier than it looks!)


Set up a T-Slot. A T-Slot should be exactly the same size as a T-Block, with one central block on the bottom and three horizontal blocks on top. See the picture at the beginning of this step for reference. Make sure your space going down to the T-Slot is only two blocks wide.
Let the T-Block fall slowly toward the bottom. Keep an eye on it as it moves.
When the T-Block is close to the bottom, press up to start rotating it. It looks impossible, but you can actually rotate the T-Block beneath the overhang.
T-Spins can be worth 400 points. Clearing 2 lines with a T-Spin is worth even more.
When the level and speed get high, you can rotate the piece constantly to lengthen the amount of time you have to drop it. Learn to use both clockwise and counter-clockwise keys to rotate, and remember to sometimes hold an I-Piece in your Hold. You can set up combos by leaving a two block wide gutter at the side of a stack, and then when its almost to the top, insert pieces vertically into it. Play it smart and you can get up to 9 combo or more.

, A ""tetris"" is when you clear four lines at once. The easiest way to do this is to build up four solid lines, and leave a one-block column clear on one side. Then, when you get an I-Block (the long, skinny one), use it to clear all four lines at once. Tetrises help you gain points fast, and are a good weapon in 2-player mode.

, There are several ways to play Tetris, but here are two common beginner styles:


Horizontal: Most people start out this way, trying to make sure every piece is laid horizontally and not caring about garbage, just making sure that it's flat.
Vertical: Some people experiment with this after horizontal. This usually happens when they get more familiar with garbage and the horrors it brings. They try to usually lay everything vertical, but caring more about filling in holes and and not letting garbage appear.

, Garbage is, quite simply, the holes that form in the Matrix because of a misplaced block. Because of garbage, certain rows cannot be cleared, as there is a hole and an unfilled space where a block should be. It is usually a pain in the neck to get rid of garbage, so that's one of the reasons it got it's name. Usually, players try not to let garbage appear, instead opting to do anything but let it. Or sometimes, if they are sure that they can clear it, they let it happen, then get rid of it.

, Don't just restart a game that's going poorly - try to save it! If you can set your level at the beginning of the game, try to pick one that challenges you without making the game insanely difficult. Practicing like this will make you better in no time.

, 2-Player Battle is a common mode in most types of Tetris. In this mode, you and an enemy player face off in a battle of wits, determination and calculated button-mashing. The first person to top out (that is, get blocks all the way to the top of the screen) loses.


Learn how to attack in 2P. Lines are sent to your opponent's Matrix whenever you clear two or more lines, do a combo, or do a T-Spin. When you send two lines to your opponent, they receive one, when you send 3, they receive 2, but when you send a Tetris (four lines), they receive the full four. T-Spins also do hilarious amounts of damage to your enemy, and so do combos.

One thing that is almost never mentioned or done is a Dual-Tetris. It sends 10 (4 for first Tetris, 6 for second if back to back) lines towards your opponent, and considering that the height of the Matrix is 20 Minos high, that's half their Matrix! Many times it is easy to destroy a person with one of these. So here's how you do it. In Tetris, there is a Hold Queue. You can press C or SHIFT(default) to place a piece in your Hold Queue. When you get a little bit better, you can set up a stack of pieces at least 8 lines high. Beware of the risks though, if the enemy does a Dual or even a regular Tetris at that moment, you're pretty much done. While you're setting up those 8 lines, you should HOLD one I-Piece(stick),then when you receive another one, pull off the move. When one I-Piece is dropping and you have the other one in your Hold, use one for a Tetris, then press the Hold button again to switch to the other one, using it for a Tetris as well.



, You know when they say: when you practice something, it becomes easier. The cool thing about Tetris is that when you play it once, you feel yourself getting better after 1 minute. Just play a lot, and if you really love the game, through your playing you will eventually find your own personal style of playing.

, This is where it all began. Basically, Marathon is the classic game mode of Tetris, where different blocks fall from the top, you have to rotate them and stick them into holes so you can fill entire rows and clear lines. A line gets taken off of the Matrix (playfield) when an entire row is solidly filled with squares. When the line is cleared, all the pieces on top of it move down one row to fill in the empty space.;
, The way you score is the same, but different strategies are necessary. Sprint is exactly like Marathon, the only difference is that you're not trying to survive as long as you can (hopefully to level 16 when the game ends at Tetris Friends). Instead, your goal is to clear 40 lines as fast as you can. You don't worry about score or anything, just wanna clear those 40 lines. There's a timer at the top of the screen that tells you how well you're doing. Generally, anything under 2 minutes is a very good score, anything under 1 minute and 30 seconds is excellent, and if you can get under one minute, you are a top dog.

, The thing is though, that instead of clearing more lines every time, you always have to clear 10, and instead of getting to level 15, you have to get past level 20 for it to count as a very good game and 40 Tokens. There's a catch, though. As soon as you beat level 20, a Bonus Round commences and all the blocks you've laid down so far start to flicker and disappear. Every once in a while, you get a glimpse of the pieces. This is why it's called Survival. In order for you to truly get far in the Bonus Round, you need to have an excellent memory, and remember exactly where every single piece has fallen.

, In Ultra, you have 2 minutes to get as much points as possible. Think of is as a time trial. This is a good training mode for speed. Speed is a huge component of Tetris.

, The reason is that it's the first multiplayer mode you get (and the only one you get if you don't have an account). In it, you go face to face with 4 other people and attempt to make them breathe your dust as you try to clear 40 lines faster than any single one of them. It gets pretty hectic at times. In this mode you can gain Ranks (which is kind of like leveling up), and the higher Rank you are, the harder the competition gets.

Escape the witch's house.,
Run for your life.,
Get the knife.,
Stab the legless girl.,
Avoid the black cat.,
Meet the demon.,
Do not move.",How to Get Different Endings in the Witch's House," The game ending only depends on how you end the story. The puzzle-solving or actions you do during the early part won't affect the outcome of the story.


Play the game until you reach the part where Viola enters the room where the witch is, and then read her diary to trigger the final part of the game.;
, Do not forget to save the game since in this part, you will be encountering many deaths because the legless girl moves ridiculously fast.


Avoid going inside rooms, and head straight to the hallway.
Do not stop until you reach the exit of the house.
Once you successfully leave the house, you will be reunited with Viola's father. The good ending will then commence.
Spoiler: Viola’s father will ask if Viola’s all right. Then as they are about to leave, the legless girl will appear and crawl after them. She will incoherently try to communicate, but Viola's father panics and shoots the girl twice in an effort to protect his daughter. The legless girl will die in a pool of blood and vanish. Viola and her father will then leave the forest.

, In the room, right after reading the witch's diary, the legless girl will start chasing after you. Before leaving the house, retrieve Ellen's knife from the black closet in the upper-right room on the first floor, the closet that initially said “Open when the house returns to normal.”


Avoid the legless girl while doing this.
Don't go to the other rooms to avoid being cornered, and then head straight to the exit.
Just like the good ending, make sure that you have saved your file to avoid losing your progress.

, After leaving the house, approach the patch of roses. Use the little bottle to get rid of them so you can pass through. The legless girl will continue to crawl after you, leaving a trail of blood.


An event will occur, and instead of running away, Viola will finally speak to the legless girl, remarking on her stubbornness before stabbing her in the eye with the knife you retrieved earlier.
Spoilers: Viola, the character you've been using, reveals that she's the true witch, and the real Viola, whom she had befriended and convinced to switch bodies with her, is trapped in Ellen's mutilated body.
Ellen admits that she used Viola's compassion and pity to her advantage until they switched bodies, with a promise of returning it back after a day. However, Ellen refused to return it afterward.
Ellen also explains how the house guided her out the whole way and also senses that the real Viola is worried for her father. Ellen promised her that she will give him Viola's share of love.
Viola's father will show up and rush toward Ellen, mistaking her as his daughter because of her appearance. The legless girl, the real Viola, tries to call out to him, but in the state of panic, he shoots her twice in the head. The father and Ellen leave the forest after that, but Ellen can be seen giggling before exiting the frame.

, To get this ending, you must play the entire game without interacting with the black cat at all, starting from the beginning until the part where you're about to enter the witch's room.

, Once you reach the part where you're about to enter the witch's room, the black cat will greet Viola. Notice that in the regular endings, Viola will only encounter a black cat's corpse in this hallway, but since you avoided the black cat, this event will be triggered.


In a brief speech, the cat will say that it knew Viola would not need its help and that the house acknowledges its true master. The cat will then say “Ellen, my faithful witch” before lying dead on the floor.
Take note that halfway through the dialogue, the name Black Cat will change to Demon, and right after its speech, if you choose to investigate the body, it will say “The corpse of a black cat possessed by a demon.”
Spoilers: At the regular ending, when you read the witch's diary, it barely explains the truth behind Ellen's body, but in this secret ending, it will unlock more content. It goes into greater detail of the reason why Ellen's body is in its mutilated state after switching with Viola.
Ellen in Viola's body gouged her eyes and cut off her legs so that Viola in Ellen's body could not try to find help. She was also given a throat burning medicine that made her unable to speak, ensuring that she could never talk to anyone.
The rest of the ending will be identical to either the good ending and the bad truth ending, depending on the player's actions.

, This is the fourth ending of the game and wasn't written in the game-maker's readme file of the latest version. This ending will require time to trigger but is easy.


When Viola wakes up in the forest at the start of the screen, DO NOT move for 10 minutes.
When the black cat gets bored and tells you to move on, remain still. After 50 minutes without moving, the cat will leave the frame.
After an hour, you will be taken to the other screen where the patch of roses vanished. Viola can walk out from the forest and then the game will end.
To make this work, your window has to be active. Do not tab or do anything else.
If you move even a little, the simple ending won't happen.
This ending gives the players an expression that Viola is still Viola since the truth was never revealed.

Get the Fast Time record.,
Earn a high score.,
Get a good ring total score.,
Cheat injury and death.,
Increase your overall skill.,
Unlock the Chaos Emeralds.",How to Get an S Rank in Sonic Colors," Try to beat the level as fast as possible. Depending on if it's a 2D or 3D stage, you may have to go for a certain possible time record.


If it's a 3D stage, then aim for two to four minutes (depending on how long the stage is, of course). If it's a 2D stage or an extremely short stage, aim for thirty seconds to over a minute.
Remember that dying multiple times and starting from a check-point does not reset the timer and only adds up to the amount of time you wasted dying in the level.;
, Earning a lot of points to get a better score also improves your rank tremendously, as getting a simple fast time alone won't get you an S rank (unless you can beat the level beyond the recommended time records). To gain points, you can beat enemies, do combo attacks, take grinding rails, drift properly...pretty much anything you do required to beat a level can get you points.


Remember to also earn as many bonus points as possible by Color Wisps, finding Red Star Rings, or performing Quick Steps. Whenever you earn bonus points, the upper right corner of the screen will tell you in blue letters.

, Collect as many rings as possible and bring them to the end of the level with you to score a perfect S rank. If you acquire many rings but lose them before reaching the end, you will not get points for that. Do not hesitate to collect any rings and don't worry about wasting time collecting them, as it will make up for your slow time. Make sure to avoid losing rings from enemies, hazards, or even death.


As long as you get at least over 100 rings, you should do fine and achieve an S rank.

, Make sure that you do not lose any lives at all when beating the level. You must be perfect in every way, so losing even one life will drop your rank from S to an A (not that A rank is bad or anything). Avoid losing your lives (even one) by passing check-points, avoiding bottomless pits, having rings at all times, knowing how to overcome hazards and obstacles, defeating enemies, and speed-boosting.


Try to avoid getting hit as well as losing lives. Getting hit not only shows how much you suck at the level, but also makes you lose rings and precious ring points (that later add up to your score at the results screen).

, This is the most important thing to do in any video game in general to become good. Try to find alternate routes, collect hidden goodies, use expert techniques for the right situation, destroy all enemies, and so on.


You should also try practicing and training in older levels by repeatedly playing them again and again to get better at the game. Backtracking is one of the most important things to do to increase your skill level in any video game.

, Completing all the levels in Sonic Simulator (which can be unlocked via Red Star Rings) will unlock all 7 Chaos Emeralds. This leads to Super Sonic, which can get you an S rank in the normal levels just by activating and staying in that form alone!

Play in the Arena.,
Craft a legendary.,
Open new packs.",How to Get Legendaries in Hearthstone," One way to get Legendaries is to play in the Arena mode. Arena mode is unlocked using 150 in-game gold or by paying $1.99 USD. You will have the chance to gain arcane dust which you can use to craft Legendaries or you may even get a legendary as a reward for winning, if you get 8 or more wins. When playing in the Arena, level up your key as high as possible. This will increase the amount of loot you get and will increase your chances of getting a pack that has a legendary in it.
One thing to keep in mind is that Arena can reward legendaries from any set, so it isn't as helpful for trying to get a specific legendary, and if you can't average more than about 3 wins per arena run, it probably isn't worth it.;
, Go into the crafting screen via the “My Collections” tab on the main page. Click “Crafting” at the top of the screen to be shown all possible cards you can craft. Sort through these until you find the legendary you are interested in creating and click it. If you have enough dust saved up (1600 Arcane Dust per legendary card) you will be able to create your own legendary.If you do not have enough dust, you can earn dust by playing ranked matches, playing in the Arena, or disenchanting cards. Be careful you don’t disenchant cards that are being used in your decks currently.
It is a good idea to save up your arcane dust to create Legendaries or epics. Don’t waste your dust on cards you will likely get simply from opening new packs.
The best way to ensure you get the legendary you want is to craft it. Every other method is luck based and you are not guaranteed to get the exact card you want. However, some Legendaries, like “The Elite Tauren Chieftain” and “Gelbin Mekkatorque” are not craftable and only able to be obtained during certain events or by opening packs.
It is probably a good idea to verify that the legendary you are wanting to craft is actually useful so that you don't waste your hard-earned arcane dust.

, You will have the chance to get a legendary card in any pack you open. While using this method is the luck of the draw, you can buy packs directly from within the game or even on external sites. Good Luck!"

Keep playing instead.,
Decide again here whether you want to finish the game, or continue on to the Blood Stained Sanctuary (also known as Hell).",How to Get Better at Cave Story," All of the weapons in Cave Story have their advantages and disadvantages, each for specific purposes.


The Polar Star is the first gun you will acquire. It is probably the most basic weapon out of the game, and therefore is one of the guns you will be using more often. Like the other weapons, it has three upgrade stages, each increasing damage and range. This weapon is effective against most; if not all enemies in the game. The weapon is semi-automatic meaning you will need to press the shoot button for every shot. However, you should not only use this weapon.
For safely taking out enemies downhill, the Fireball may be a better option. Instead of shooting strait forward, the Fireball's projectiles move along the floor until making contact with a foe or going to far. Upgrades include projectile output number, damage, and range.
For bosses, the rocket launcher reigns supreme nine times out of ten. That other one is against the first version of Balrog in which you don't technically have it. Upgrades effect damage. The only downside of the rocket launcher is its limited ammo, so it's recommended mostly against bosses.
The bubbler is practically useless until its third state, in which it surrounds the player in a bubble dome absorbing attacks. Note when you release the shoot button the bubbles turn into projectiles. This is effective against a flying enemy that shoots at you.;
, How will you know which weapons to use? Taking a look at your environment is crucial. Look at all of your foes, and decide weather or not to go full bore with a rocket launcher stream, or pick them off with Polar Star blasts.

, Jumping is one of the most notable yet irritating things in Cave Story. There is, however, a way to master it. Quote will jump higher the longer you hold the jump button. Tapping it will make him hop. When you let go of the jump button, or Quote reaches his maximum height, he will begin his descent. When you come to a certain point of the game, you can double tap the jump button to use the Booster jetpack.


Note that you can't jump as high when under water.

, This step is, without a doubt, a must-read if you plan on completing the game with a perfect run. If not, continue to the next part. In some parts of the game, you will come across a point in which you will do some decision making. Some decisions dictate the outcome of the game, while others can make changes to your inventory. Here are the steps to the best weapons, and the best outcome:


The first time you are asked yes or no will be by Sue in the chamber of egg no. 00. This decision will not matter if you choose yes or no. You will just get a different reaction out of Sue for one chat line.
The next choice will be Grasstown (or Bushlands if you're on the Wii) when you come across the mysterious shouting in the building. You have to choose yes, or else you will not continue on in the game.

, After you defeat her, she will ask if you are going to slaughter the rest of the Mimiga. Say no, and she will become your ally. She will then offer if she can trade her gun for yours. This choice is entirely up to you, in which you will receive the Machine Gun. It is a limited ammo weapon, but unlike the Rocket Launcher, the ammo will regenerate so long as you have the MG equipped. Leveling it up increases the damage.


On level three, you can shoot downward and it will propel you upward. However, if you decide to keep the Polar Star, you can trade that for an ever better weapon knows as the Spur. This, unfortunately, won't come until later on in the game. Or, you can trade it for the snake, mentioned next.

, When you get to the part of the Labyrinth where you have the enemies who shoot at you, you can go into a shop near the entrance of this part and trade the Polar Star for the Snake. No, it's not a legit snake. Just go to the cockroach thing that is behind the counter. The Snake is like the Polar Star in which its projectiles shoot forward, but the projectiles can go through walls. Upgrades include range and damage.

, The decision you make here is crucial. You will see a brief cut-scene of Professor Booster falling. Do not go and check on him. Instead, save your game before attempting the jump across the gap. This way, if you fall, you can just reload. Note there will be a red spot on the floor where you will jump off of to get to the other side. Do not go to Booster because he will give you the Booster v0.8 jetpack. It sounds cool, but if you wait you will get an even better one later on. Also, this one can dictate a major part of the game for the worst.

, Before you continue to Curly after opening the blast door to the Core, go along the bottom and look for something that is sparkling in the water. It will ask to pick up the Tow Rope. Accept. After you defeat the Core and you ""drown"" you will be able to use the Tow Rope to carry Curly, and continue your adventures with her.

, When you reach the waterway shack, go to the bed and rest. You will set Curly down. Go to the computer and then the bookshelf. Search the bookshelf and you should learn how to drain flooded robots. Drain Curly. When she falls asleep, do not leave her. You will carry her back into the waterway.

,


Note that this is the worst ending and will make you look like a coward. Just say yes to Kazuma when he wants you to escape with him.
If you say no, just climb your way up the outer wall. Unless, you want to trade the Blade for the Nemesis. Again, this is your decision. Just jump off the edge, and cut back under the metal to a doorway. Ask the little people if they want to trade, then accept.

, This decision will make a different outcome of the game, but it will be more humorous than anything. Just keep the mimiga mask on in the plantation and fly on the rocket up to the Last Cave rather than talk to Momorin Sakamoto.


Assuming you went to get Ma Pignon, he will try to fake you out with some questioning. Just look at the question carefully and answer accordingly. Examine the ""Mushroom Badge"" in your inventory and talk to him again, and you will battle him. Win to get the real mushroom badge.
After Curly eats Ma Pignon an tells you everything that happened with you two, talk to her again to get the Iron Bond.

, Unlike the previous ending, this one isn't entirely bad and you get to see the end credits. Just follow Sue all the way after battling the Undead Core. Otherwise, go into the shack you saved your game in before you fought the three bosses. Note that to get out of this situation, you just talk to the bookcase on the left.

Winning one battle in Monad at level 65 can boost your level up to 72 in an instant.
In Persona 3 FES, you will need to defeat the Reaper at the top of Tartarus in order to unlock access to Monad.
It is immediately available if you start New Game+ mode in Persona 3 FES.;
, The most essential party member for this method is Alice, as she has the ""Die for me!"" skill. It is much like Mamudoon (instant death to all enemies), except that it gives a higher chance of success.


This skill will be essential for ensuring that the enemies don't get a hit on you.

, Chances are you are going to die often, so you'll want a save file that you can quickly restore to.

, It is located at the first floor of Tartarus, that huge double door at the right side of the stairs. You can't miss it.

, Find a shadow and make sure you get a preemptive strike by striking it from behind.


The shadows at Monad range from levels 88–98, making it a great place to level-grind with instant kill spells. However, failure to get preemptive strikes will also cause your party to die instantly.

, If a Grand Magus, Vehement Idol, Chaos Cyclops, or a Void Giant appears at the higher floors, immediately abort the battle. These four shadows will either block or reflect your ""Die for me!"" skill.

, If you encounter enemies that cannot block or reflect Dark Spell, start spamming ""Die for me!"" until you win the battle.


""Die for me!"" gives an 80% chance to instantly kill shadows via Darkness magic.

If your hardware is slow, you may end up losing some valuable time. Dedicate your system’s resources to the game and close all the others applications.;
, Even before getting the word “Go” to signal the official clock, you can already start moving and clearing some gems. These additional gems add to your score.

, This is the most basic move there is in every match-three type of game. Go ahead and match them to clear them out of the board.

, As much as possible, aim to get and clear 4 or 5 gems in a row to get those Power Gems and Hyper Cubes. These will contribute a lot to getting you a high score.


Refer to Part 2 to know more about Power Gems and Hyper Cubes.

, After getting those Power Gems and Hyper Cubes, do not use them right away. Save and collect them until you have plenty on your board. Use them when you have a lot on the board to increase your Multipliers, which in turn will multiply the points you get.


Multipliers appear when you remove 12 or more gems with one move, caused by multiple Power Gems, Hyper Cubes, or a series of cascades.

, Do your matches quickly enough and you will be awarded with a Speed Bonus. Don’t remain idle for too long.


Once you get the Speed Bonus, take advantage of it by continuously clearing more gems on the board. All the matches you make, together with the Speed Bonus, will surely bring you huge points. Think and act fast!

, At the start of every game, you can equip up to three boosters. Do that and use them appropriately during the game.


Refer to Part 3 to know more about the boosters.

, At the start of every game, you can also harvest some Rare Gems for you to use within the next game. Rare Gems can enhance your game play and increase your scores.

, Dedicate your full attention on clearing the board, and don’t mind the clock counting down. You will lose focus and some precious seconds when you do.

, The more you play, the more familiar you get with how the whole thing works. Before you know it, matching multiple gems and generating series of cascades will be second-nature to you.


Play often to get better experience, which in turn will get you higher scores.

, Flame Gems, a type of Power Gem, are generated by matching 4 similar gems in a row, either vertically or horizontally.


Flame Gem, when used, will explode clearing out itself and all the gems adjacent to it.

, Star Gems, a type of Power Gem, are generated by matching similar gems that form either a T or an L shape.


A Star Gem, when used, will zap and clear out both the row and the column it belongs to.

, Hyper Cubes are generated by matching 5 similar gems in a row, either vertically or horizontally.


A Hyper Cube, when used, will destroy all the gems of one color on the board.
If you happen to have that rare situation of having two Hyper Cubes side by side, swapping these two will destroy all the gems on the board. Be sure to take a moment to watch this spectacular show on your screen.

, The Mystery Gem booster adds a random special gem on the board at the start of the game. If you want to try your luck, go for this booster and be surprised with what you get


This costs 6000 coins.

, The Detonator booster detonates all the special gems on the board when used during the game. It acts and works like the Last Hurrah event at the end of the game.


This can only be used once and it costs 3000 coins.

, The Scrambler booster shuffles or scrambles the gems on the board, giving you a fresh board to work on. It’s a good booster to use when you’re stuck.


You can use this twice in a game and costs 4000 coins.

, The +5 Seconds booster adds an extra five seconds on your game play at the end of the game. In a time-limited game like Bejeweled Blitz, five seconds can be a lot.


This costs 4500 coins.

, The Bonus Multiplier booster adds a multiplier gem on the board at the start of the game. Having this in play will significantly raise your chances of getting a high score early on.


This costs 7500 coins.

, It would be ideal to have a grass or water type Pokémon for this gym battle, but at the very beginning of the game your options are extremely limited. There are 4 helpful Pokémon that can help you obtain the Boulder Badge.


Mankey is a fighting type found on Route 22 and is very helpful in the battle against Brock because fighting-type moves are super effective against rock types.
Nidoran in either female or male form because both learn Double Kick as they level up which is a fighting type move. Nidoran is also found on Route 22 as well as Route 2.
Butterfree learns Confusion as soon as it evolves from Metapod (which evolves from Caterpie, found in Viridian Forest) at level 10, which is useful because Geodude and Onix's special stat are low and Confusion does neutral damage against them.

, If you really truly want to use Pikachu, you should level it up to level 15 so that it knows Quick Attack and Double Team. Mankey should be between the level of 9 to 13 at the lowest. Nidoran should be leveled up to around 14 at the minimum. Butterfree should be at least level 12.


You shouldn't have a problem leveling up your Pikachu because of the mass amount of Pidgey and Spearow that you will run into. Just Thundershock them and gain some quick experience.
Once Mankey (Low Kick) and Nidoran (Double Kick) have learned a fighting type move, they can make quick work of normal types like Rattata. The same goes with Butterfree once Metapod evolves into it.

, Now that you have your party all set make sure you have a few Potions (3 to 4) and then challenge the Pewter Gym.


There is only 1 gym trainer who has a level 9 Diglett and a level 9 Sandshrew. Both of these Pokémon are strictly ground types so your fighting type moves won't be super effective against him. Take out his Pokémon with moves like Quick Attack and Gust (if you have a Pidgey or Pidgeotto) and then heal if you wish before taking on Brock.

, Now you're ready to take on Brock; nothing is standing in your way. After defeating Brock you will earn the Boulder Badge and TM34, which is the move Bide.


Brock starts things off with a level 10 Geodude. Geodude is a rock/ground type so your fighting-type moves will be super-effective. Geodude only knows Tackle so you should be able to take him out rather easily.
Brock will then send out his other Pokémon Onix which is level 12 and is also a rock/ground type. Onix knows Tackle, Screech, Bide and Bind. The only move you should really worry about is Bide. Once you see Bide used you should hold off your attacks and use status moves like Tail Whip to lower its defense until Bide is over, that way you won't take damage from it. Once again fighting-type moves are super-effective, so just keep attacking as long as Onix isn't using Bide. If you're using Butterfree, attack it with Confusion. As with Mankey or Nidoran, use one of its status moves (Harden, String Shot, Stun Spore, Poison Powder, or Sleep Powder) when Onix is using Bide.
Use a Potion whenever your Pokémon's HP runs low and you shouldn't have too much of a problem.

Keeping your Pikachu with you and safe will increase the number, while stowing it away and losing it in battle will lower the number.You can hit the “A” button when facing Pikachu and his response will help reveal how happy it is.;
, This is the fastest way to increase happiness (though perhaps also the most tedious). Health potions can be purchased from the store and used repeatedly on Pikachu to increase happiness.


Potions will increase happiness even when Pikachu is at full health.
Different items will increase happiness by the same amount.

, Pikachu will become happier anytime it levels up. This can be from combat out in the world or from using rare candies.

, Using Pikachu during these battle is enough to get a happiness bonus. However, gym leaders are finite and it’s difficult to find enough to consistently increase happiness.


You can put Pikachu and the head of your party then immediately swap it out at the start of the fight and still receive the bonus happiness.

Note that since only the least significant of the two Special bytes is used for this, you can also add 256 to the values listed above and use that Special to get the same Pokémon.",How to Find Mew in Pokémon Red/Blue3," Now that you know how the trick works, use it to catch other Pokémon. Fighting the Youngster will always result in a Mew encounter because his Slowpoke has a Special of 21 (15 in hex). But if you fight something else before returning to Route 8, it will change which Pokémon you encounter. For example, say you chose a starting Pokémon other than Bulbasaur and regret your decision. Bulbasaur's hex number is 99, which converts to 153 in decimal. Now, you could fight a wild Pokémon with a Special of 153, but the only place to find that is on a Level 64 Chansey in the Unknown Dungeon, and those Chansey are quite rare. Worse, they only have a one-in-sixteen chance of having the right Special. Fortunately, there is a solution: Ditto's Transform, which copies the stats of the opponent. This means that you can catch any Pokémon in the game by following the steps set forth in this section.

, You can find a complete list of which decimal value is needed for each Pokémon at the bottom of the page.

, Fly away from the Gambler battle.

,,,,, This is important because there are a few Pokémon, such as Kangaskhan, whose identifying value is lower than the minimum Special that any Pokémon can have. In Kangaskhan's case, you can find her by using a Special of 258 (2 + 256).


Also note that when you perform this trick, any trainers you fight after the Gambler will be ""used up."" Make sure you have enough unused trainers to catch all the Pokémon you want! Fortunately, the Gambler can be used to initiate the trick an unlimited number of times.

, The DexNav is the red square with a Poké Ball and Pikachu on the bottom screen.

, When a hidden Pokémon is nearby, a magnifying glass will appear on the screen. Touch it, and a target will appear. As you get closer to the Pokémon, it will glow red.

, Sneak up on it by lightly pushing the control stick in the direction you want to go. Once you've snuck up to it, you'll get into a battle with it. If you go too fast, it will spot you and disappear.

, This will make it appear on your DexNav.

,, Press the search button, and the DexNav will search for it in the area. The target will glow red if the Pokémon is spotted nearby, otherwise, you'll be told it couldn't find the Pokémon.

, The higher the search level, the more likely you'll be to find Pokémon with hidden abilities (abilities a Pokémon wouldn't normally be able to have if you catch it normally in the wild), egg moves (moves it would normally learn by being bred), and high IVs. IVs determine how high a specific stat is. The higher an IV is, the higher the stat is. IVs are indicated by stars, and for each star filled in, the Pokémon has an IV of 31 (the maximum possible) in a specific stat. The DexNav indicates hidden abilities, egg moves, and high IVs with a red circle with an exclamation mark next to the info.

Buy a lot of Repels.,
Get False Swipe.,

Move to the middle of the grass.,
Use your first Repel, and then search for the Pokémon that you want.,
Sneak, don't walk or run.,
Defeat the Pokémon.,
Keep repeating this process until you have a shiny.",How to Shiny Chain in ORAS," Shiny chaining can take hours, and once you start chaining, putting your 3DS into standby mode will break the chain.;
, This step is not required by any means, however it will help. You can obtain the shiny charm from Professor Birch after completing the National Pokedex (Barring event Pokémon).

, These items will keep Pokémon that are below your main Pokémon's level from attacking and breaking your chain. As you will not be relying on getting random encounters when chaining, these items will be a godsend.



Be sure that you have enough Pokeballs to catch the shiny when you find it. It is recommended that you get Timer Balls, Ultra Balls, and Dusk Balls for when your planning on chaining during the night.

, This step will save you so much trouble in the long run. False Swipe is a move that always leaves the opposing Pokémon at 1 HP. This move can be taught by TM, and 16 Pokémon can learn it naturally. You can find it in the Rustboro City Poké Mart.


On that note, be sure to also bring a Pokémon that can inflict a status condition like sleep or paralysis.

, In order to start chaining, you need to use the DexNav to search for the Pokémon that you want. You can't search for the Pokémon you want until you have already caught at least one of them.

, If there's multiple patches nearby, then move to the middle of them. This will give you enough room to move in any direction.

, Once you hit the search button, a patch of grass will start to shake, and part of the Pokémon you're searching for will stick out of it.

, If you push the circle pad gently, your character will start to sneak instead of walk. Make sure you don't scare off the Pokémon, or else you'll break the chain.

, Once you've done that, repeat step seven. This will be a very long and tedious process, so be prepared to spend hours fighting Pokémon. Remember to not run away from a Pokémon, as doing that breaks your chain.


If a Pokémon runs away, your chain is broken, restart.
If a Pokémon uses Teleport, your chain is broken, restart.
If you leave the area or get into a battle with a Trainer, your chain is broken, restart.
Note that getting the message ""The Pokémon couldn't be found. Try looking in a different area!"" will not break the chain, nor will encountering another Pokémon, as long as it was hidden. Said Pokémon running away will also break your chain.

, The chance of encountering a Shiny Pokémon increases by 0.5% per encounter after 40 chained encounters, and will remain at that rate as long as the chain continues, meaning a 50% chance of encountering a Shiny Pokémon in the first 130 chained encounters. It's a tedious process, but when you finally get that shiny, it'll all have been worth it!

Don't worry about your Pokémon fainting, since Healing Wish, which is the only move the Blissey will know, faints the Blissey, and fails if one is left, allowing you to defeat them easily. As Blissey has the highest experience yield in the game, you'll gain at least 10,000 experience points per Blissey, and you can get even more (possibly over 50,000 experience points per Blissey) by following the tips below. You can battle with the person in the base once a day.

Weaken the Pokémon.,
Use status ailments.",How to Catch Pokémon in Pokémon Red/Blue1," Go to Items and choose Poké Ball. The trick is to get its health as low as you can without letting it faint. Use a combination of weak and medium power attacks to do this. See the numbers after each technique? These are called the Power Points or PP. Generally, the higher the PP, the weaker the attack.;
,


Poisoning or burning the wild Pokémon will cause its HP to gradually deplete, making it easier to catch, but increasing the risk of causing it to faint.
Putting it to sleep or paralyzing it are more reliable methods, however sleep only lasts a few turns and paralysis still allows it to fight back sometimes.

This will make it easy to reset if you accidentally knock out the Legendary Pokémon, or you get defeated., Walk through the cave entrance and then walk to the back of the cave., Confirm that you want to reach into the portal and the battle with the Legendary Pokémon will begin., Use your Pokémon that have effective attacks against the Legendary Pokémon (Ground-, Rock-, and Dragon-type for Reshiram, Ground-, Ice-, Dragon-, or Fairy-type for Zekrom). Use these attacks to take a significant portion of the Legendary Pokémon's health down., The False Swipe attack can be used to drop the Pokémon's health down to 1 HP without knocking it out, making it easier to capture., Once the Reshiram or Zekrom's health is lowered to 1 HP, use the move that gives Paralyze (Reshiram) or Sleep (Zekrom).

If at any time during the battle the Pokémon breaks free or wakes up, use the status effect again to keep it trapped.

, Continue to throw Ultra Balls until you've either caught the Pokémon or you've reached approximately turn 30., This late in the battle, the Timer Balls are more effective than the Ultra Balls. Keep at it, and you'll soon have the Legendary Pokémon captured., If you've knocked out Reshiram or Zekrom and forgot to save right before the battle, you can get another chance by facing off against the Elite Four again, If you have Alpha Sapphire, you can't capture Reshiram. If you have Omega Ruby, you can't capture Zekrom. The only way to get the Legendary Pokémon you can't catch is to trade someone for it. This means coming up with a trade offer that someone would accept.

Enjoy your powerful Pokémon!",How to Breed the Perfect Pokémon in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire," The first step is simply to decide what Pokémon you wish to breed. This is simply up to you and what you want. It may be very beneficial for you to look up your Pokémon on a site like Bulbapedia or Serebii.net and keep the page open for reference as these will give you valuable information on the Pokémon for anything from the Pokémon's stats, to its abilities, to its movepool (including egg moves).;
, It is important to know about egg groups before you begin breeding, as these are what allow Pokémon to be breed. Pokémon will have one to two egg groups and can only breed with another Pokémon that shares their egg group.

It is important to note that one group of Pokémon – the Undiscovered egg group – cannot breed. This includes most legendary Pokémon and “Baby” Pokémon. In the case that a Pokémon is in this egg group, there is a chance that one of its evolutions will not be in this egg group and can breed with other Pokémon, as is the case with most baby Pokémon. However, if all of the Pokémon in the evolutionary family are in the Undiscovered egg group, or if the Pokémon has no evolutions, then the Pokémon is not possible to breed in any way. Pick a different Pokémon to breed if you find this happening to you.
To check the egg group of your Pokémon, you can use this List of Pokémon by Egg Group on Bulbapedia.

, Natures affect the stats of Pokémon, most natures will increase one stat while decreasing another, while some will not change any stats for the Pokémon. This is important to remember when considering how to specialize the Pokémon. Will it be an attacker? A defender? Natures are a big factor in determining how well the Pokémon can play that role. The above image shows how each nature affects stats. The boxes in yellow are the natures which have no affect on stats.

If you ever wish to check the nature of a Pokémon, open up the pause menu, go into the Pokémon tab, select the Pokémon you wish to look at and then hit Summary.






Here you can view the moves of your Pokémon, its stats, ability, type, name, level, and so on. If you press right twice from this screen, it will take you to another screen that will list the nature of the Pokémon at the top of the top screen.

, Most Pokémon have more than one ability that they can have. These are very important in battling, as they can seriously affect how the Pokémon is best trained. This is also very important for obtaining the Pokémon desired, as – if the Pokémon has two abilities and a hidden ability), how the bred Pokémon inherit abilities will become extremely important. The following is a basic summary:

Male with plain ability bred with Ditto / Male bred with Female with plain ability:

80% Chance of father’s ability (male with a ditto) or mother’s ability (male with female)
20% Chance of other plain ability
0% Chance of hidden ability


Male with hidden ability with Ditto / Male bred with Female with hidden ability:

20% Chance of plain ability 1
20% Chance of plain ability 2
60% Chance of hidden ability


Notice that when the male Pokémon is coupled with a female of the same species, the ability it has does not matter at all. This is important to note because if a male of the species has the desired ability to be bred, then it should be paired with a ditto or female with the same ability for the bred Pokémon to be more likely to inherit the desired ability. Also note that not all Pokémon have two plain abilities, and some don’t have hidden abilities.
If the Pokémon does not have a hidden ability, but has two plain abilities, refer to the first list, as this still holds true.
If the Pokémon has one hidden ability and one plain ability and possesses the plain ability it will pass down the plain ability 100% of the time. If it has the hidden ability, it will pass down the hidden ability 60% of the time and the plain ability 40% of the time.
If the Pokémon has just one ability, then that is simply what it will have.
If you want more information on the abilities your Pokémon can have, look on the webpage of the Pokémon (the one from Step 1). It should list the abilities of the Pokémon relatively close to the top of the page with a clickable link to a page that describes the ability.

, Some moves can only be learned by Pokémon through breeding, rather than by leveling up. In these cases, they must get the move(s) from their father, which must be a different Pokémon in the same egg group who currently knows the egg move(s) desired.,







To Get the Destiny Knot

Travel to the Sea Mauville (You will need the move Surf)
Enter the ship through the entrance
Look for the couple in the first door on the right of the left-hand hallway of the ship.
Battle with the couple.
Leave and wait for them to become battle ready again. You can check if they are ready using the Area Navigation feature on the bottom screen.
Head back to them and battle them again.
Repeat the previous two steps until they give you the Destiny Knot. (Note that this is entirely random and could take as little as 2 battles or more than 15 battles before they give the Destiny Knot)
Alternately, this item can be received as a random award for winning Master Rank Pokémon contests, or as a 1% chance from a Pokémon between level 51 and 100 with the ability Pickup after any battle.



To get the Everstone

(Important Note: Mach Bike is necessary for this)
Fly (or Travel) to the Granite Cave (bottom-left corner of the map)
Follow the path inside until you see a divide with a staircase leading down one way and a dirt slope going up the other.
Use the mach bike to travel up this slope and follow the path until you reach a ladder going down. Climb down.
Follow the path on this floor until you see the first dirt path heading up.
Use the mach bike to go up this path.
Head right, up another slope and follow that path until you reach a ladder heading down and take it.
Make your way to the left-hand side of this floor and walk up the stairs on this side.
Head up and to the right to reach the top of the center of the room, where there is a slightly raised platform with a rock in the center of it.
The Everstone is hidden inside. Simply walk up the stairs and press A on the rock.
Alternately, these can be obtained quite commonly from wild Roggenrola.



, It is strongly recommended as Flame Body and Magma armor are both wonderful abilities in the realm of breeding as they cut the time it takes to hatch an egg in half if you keep them in your party! Because breeding tends to be a very long process anyway, this is very helpful. The Bulbapedia page links below both give a description of the abilities and a list of the Pokémon who can have them.

Magma Armor

In order to get on the (relatively) fast track to obtaining a perfect Pokémon, one of the best things to do is hunt for the Pokémon using the DexNav, as this can lead to finding Pokémon with 3 perfect stats, the ability desired (including hidden abilities), specific gender, and even some egg moves more reliably than any other method of capture (some of these being impossible without chaining).

Note: A strong physical attacker Pokémon with False Swipe is highly recommended and another Pokémon with a move such as Hypnosis, Spore, or Sleep Powder may also be used to make catching when the time comes easier.
If you need a guide on this process, go to .
If you do not know where to find on the Pokémon, look on the webpage for the Pokémon (the one from Step 1), there will be a section called ""Locations"" or ""Game Locations"" depending on which website you went to. Under this, it will list where/how to obtain the Pokémon in each game. Look for Omega Ruby and/or Alpha Sapphire. It will list either a route number (or some other location), or some specific action such as ""Evolve (Pre-evolution)"" or ""Trade.""
In the case your Pokémon does not have an in-game location, do not lose hope. If you either already have one, can transfer it from another game, or are just willing to try trading, then you can use this and simply get several compatible partners that cover all IVs necessary.

, Keep finding and knocking out the Pokémon until one shows up with 3 IVs (and, if desired, keep going until it has the correct ability, gender etc.). Keep in mind that if egg moves are desired, then this Pokémon should be the female so that the bred Pokémon will inherit moves from the father otherwise unobtainable by the Pokémon. Also, if a hidden ability is desired, finding one with the correct ability is a must, as there is no other way of breeding this without a parent with the ability. Once one like this shows up, be sure to catch it. Maximize the chance of success by using False Swipe until it only has a sliver of health and then using move to put the Pokémon to sleep (if applicable and desired).

Note: Most of the time, a Pokémon will only use Physical Attack or Special Attack exclusively and not the other, making 5 perfect IVs suitable for most Pokémon. As such, generally a Pokémon with perfect IVs in Attack and Special Attack is much less desirable than having perfect IV’s in the stat it will be using for offense, and any other stat. (For instance, a physical attacker would want Attack and Defense over Attack and Special Attack).

, The next step is getting a compatible Pokémon or a Ditto to breed with. If egg moves are desired, find a male Pokémon which can pass a move it learns as an egg move to the Pokémon. If not, it is generally fastest to catch the opposite gender in the same species. If a male Pokémon was caught, then a female with the desired ability is recommended (if not, then a Ditto should be used). The second Pokémon should also have 3 IVs, preferably with 2 being in stats not matching the first (and also usually not in the opposite offensive stat).

, Now it’s time to begin the breeding process. In order to breed, access to a Pokémon Daycare is required. There are two in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, however, the more ideal of them is located at the Battle Resort. This is because the Battle Resort is an island that can be looped around regularly, and the Stats Judge is located in the Pokémon Center on this island.

, If one of the parents has the desired nature for the bred Pokémon, give that parent the Everstone. This will ensure that that parent’s nature is passed down. Give the other the Destiny knot, which will cause the bred Pokémon to inherit 5 IVs from their parents instead of the usual 3. This gives the best chance of obtaining a Pokémon with 4 or more perfect IVs (Assuming the two parents each have 3 perfect IVs each with at least 4 stats covered between them). If neither parent has the nature desired, either search for a Pokémon with the correct nature that can be bred into the desired Pokémon, or give neither parent the Everstone and simply breed until the correct nature shows up. The Destiny Knot can be given to either parent in this situation.

To put the Pokémon in the DayCare, talk to the girl inside and tell her you want to leave your Pokémon there and then select the ones you want to put in the Day Care from the menu that pops up (this will happen one at a time).
As a tip, be sure to talk to the boy outside of the DayCare, he will say one of a few things:

""They really seem to like hanging out!"" - This means that the Pokémon will have a 70% chance of having an egg every 256 steps you take.
""The two seem to get along all right."" - This means that the Pokémon will have a 50% chance of having an egg fro every 256 steps you take.
""But they don’t seem to like each other very much..."" - This means the Pokémon will have a 20% chance of having an egg every 256 steps you take.
""Seems they’d rather play with other Pokémon—not so much with each other."" - This is the one you want to look out for, as it means the Pokémon you have put in the Day Care together are either not compatible or at least one cannot breed. To solve this, check that neither Pokémon is in the Undiscovered egg group, that not both are male, and that both Pokémon share an egg group.




, The longest part of breeding for perfect Pokémon is obtaining and hatching eggs. All of this is determined by number of steps taken. As stated in the previous step, there is a chance of obtaining an egg every 256 steps. A step in the game is really just a unit of distance traveled (barring flying), so the fastest way to cover this is to simply use the mach bike and ride in circles around the island.

To make the breeding process as fast as possible, when you place the Pokémon to breed in the DayCare, put all of your Pokémon into the PC other than your Pokémon with Flame Body/Magma Armor (if applicable). This will allow you to hold onto and make progress on hatching 5 eggs at the same time. You can also use the Hatching O-Power if you would like to speed things up further.
If you would like to know more about O-Powers, you can refer to O-Powers on Serebii.net.

, When you are passing the boy outside the DayCare, look to see if he is facing toward or away from the fence. Normally, he will face toward the fence, but when he faces away, it means that an egg has been found for you. Talk to him whenever you see this.

You can usually get five eggs in with you (the max you can hold) before the first one hatches.

, This will just take time. Keep making laps around the Battle Resort and this will eventually happen.

, The Stats Judge in the Pokémon Center at the Battle Resort is your way of telling what the IVs of your Pokémon are like. Here is how you determine the stats based on what the Stats Judge says:

""This Pokémon's potential is (see list below) overall.""

""Decent"" - Total IVs are between 0 and 90
""Above Average"" - Total IVs are between 91 and 120
""Relatively Superior"" - Total IVs are between 121 and 150
""Outstanding"" - Total IVs are between 151 and 186


Next, he will continue to list the Pokémon's best stat
""Incidentally, I would say its greatest potential lies in its (best stat)""
He will continue on to list other stats equal to it if such a case exists, saying the following for each.

""But its Attack stat is good, too.""
""Hmm. And its Defense stat is good, too.""
""Although its Sp. Atk. is equally good.""
""Its Sp. Def stat seems just as good, though.""
""And well, its Speed stat is good, too.""


(There is no added text for the HP stat because he goes through the stats sequentially HP, Atk, Def, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Spe).
Based on the Pokémon's individual highest IV, he will make one of the following statements:

IV between 0 and 15 - ""It has rather decent stats, I'd say. That's how I judge it.""
IV between 16 and 25 - ""It's definitely got some good stats. That's how I judge it.""
IV between 26 and 30 - ""This Pokémon has some fantastic stats. That's how I judge it.""
IV of 31 - ""Stats like those... They simply can't be beat! That's how I judge it.""


So, combining this with the last set of statements, if a Pokémon has perfect IVs in HP, Attack, Defense, and Speed, he would say this.

""Incidentally, I would say its greatest potential lies in its HP. But its Attack stat is good, too. Hmm. And its Defense stat is good, too. And well, its Speed stat is good, too. Stats like those... They simply can't be beat! That's how I judge it.""


This is how you will tell which stats have perfect IVs for your newly hatched Pokémon.
Also be sure to check the Pokémon summaries yourself, so you can check for nature (if needed) and to make sure the Pokémon has the correct ability.

, Whenever a Pokémon is hatched with more IVs than its parent, it is likely that you will want to switch this Pokémon in for the old one. However, this is not always the case. Here are some examples to give you an idea of what to look for.

If neither parent had the desired nature, and the bred Pokémon has the nature and ability desired, as well as at least 3 IVs matching with one of the parents, then it would be best to replace that parent with the one bred from it. Be sure to give this Pokémon the Everstone before you take out the parent and put it in the DayCare.
If the Pokémon has more IVs than one of its parents, while sharing the three the parent has (as well as ability and desired nature), then it would be best to switch out these Pokémon. However, if they do not share three stats, then one stat would not be covered and thus it would not be better to switch them out. There is one exception to this and that is if the other parent covers the stat that child does not have as well.

ie. Father with Attack, Defense, Sp. Defense, mother with HP, Defense, Speed. If the Child were to have HP, Attack, Sp. Defense, Speed, it would be OK to switch then too because Defense is still covered by the opposite parent.


If the child does not have the ability desired, it is not usually recommended to switch out a parent for it, unless the parent it could switch out with is the father in a father/mother breeding scenario
Note: Keep in mind the genders of the parents and the gender of the child when swapping out. In the case Ditto is one of the parents, it doesn't matter at all, but in the case of having two parents, males can only replace the father and females can only replace the mother. Also, these few examples should give an approximate idea of when is good and when is bad to switch out breeding Pokémon, but they do not cover all intricacies. Just be careful when switching Pokémon out and think through everything logically.
If you do not switch out the Pokémon in the DayCare, then either place the newly hatched Pokémon in your PC, or release them through your PC so that your party is clear of all Pokémon other than your Flame Body/Magma Armor user. If you do plan to switch out Pokémon, it is still easiest to release or place in the PC the ones that will not be used prior to switching out the Pokémon (as you will need at least one free space in your party to withdraw the one you are replacing).

, This is where the long and tedious part of this process comes in. Because everything is determined by basic random chance, you could receive the Pokémon of your dreams within one egg (which is almost negligible chance) to hundreds of eggs. Ultimately this guide can only seek to maximize your chances and minimize the time it takes to get your Pokémon., Congratulations Trainer! Your hard work has paid off. Now you just have to EV train the Pokémon to have it realize its true potential (a whole other process that you can learn about though ."

Identify which Pokémon Luvdisc is weak against.,
Identify which Pokémon Luvdisc is strong against.,
Gain experience points (XP).,
Use in-game items to level Luvdisc up.,
Continue leveling Luvdisc up to learn new moves.",How to Train Luvdisc," With the help of the good old Pokédex (accessible inside the game), you can identify which Pokémon types Luvdisc is strongest and weakest against. This will help you win Pokémon battles easily and more effectively.


Luvdisc is a water-type Pokémon, so it’s severely weak against grass (like Bulbasaur and Chikorita) and electric types (like Pikachu and Jolteon).
Luvdisc will take twice the normal damage than it will get from other types and could even get knocked out instantly when hit with pure-type attacks like Thunderbolt and Solar Beam.;
, In contrast, Luvdisc is super effective against fire, ground, and rock types.


Luvdisc can deal twice or, if the Pokémon has two types that are weak to water, four times the normal damage to Pokémon like Charmander, Geodude, and Diglett compared to other Pokémon types. In some cases, Luvdisc can even take down these Pokémon with only one shot using pure water-type attacks like Hydro Pump.

, Once you get to understand how to effectively use Luvdisc’s type, go out and do Pokémon battles to gain XP. Battle Pokémon types that Luvdisc is most effective against for easy wins, and avoid types that can inflict severe damage.


There is no specific kind of battle you need to do, but fighting trainers, which can be found anywhere in the game, gives off more XP compared to defeating wild Pokémon.

, If you don’t like to grind just to level up Luvdisc, you can always use in-game items like Rare Candies.


Rare Candies allow your Pokémon to gain one level instantly without doing any Pokémon battles. This is the quick-and-easy way, but each game only has a limited number of Rare Candies that you can get, usually from side quests.

, As Luvdisc levels up, it will naturally learn new moves and attacks.


Powerful attacks like Water Gun and Water Pulse can be learned when Luvdisc reaches specific levels (level 7 for Water Gun and level 22 for Water Pulse). These moves are very effective and strong enough that it can knock down an opponent with one attack, provided it’s a fire, ground, or rock Pokémon (types that are weak against water Pokémon).

Team Magma and Team Aqua will accidentally awake these Pokémon in the Seafloor Cavern after you pass through Sootopolis City for the first time. As long as you play through the story, you won't be able to miss this event.


You can have Goldeen learn Waterfall by leveling it up to Level 38, but you'll still need the Rain Badge in order to use it outside of battle to climb waterfalls.;
, You can do this as soon as you exit the Seafloor Cavern after Kyogre and Groudon are awakened. You'll see the two Legendary Pokémon fighting in Sootopolis City, causing the severe weather changes.

, You'll find him outside of the Gym, which is closed for now due to the Legendary battle. Steven will take you to the Cave of Origins, where Wallace is waiting.

, This is the location of Rayquaza, which you'll need to awaken in order to stop Kyogre and Groudon.

, You'll need the Mach Bike in order to make your way to the top of the Sky Pillar. You can Fly to Mauville and get one from Rydel's Cycles if you don't have it yet.

, This will be the quickest way to reach the Sky Pillar. If you prefer to take the long way, you'll need to Surf from Route 126 out of Sootopolis all the way to Route 131.


You may not have visited Pacifidlog City yet, in which case you'll need to surf from Route 126 to Route 131, passing through 127, 128, 129, and 130 on the way. Make sure to visit Pacifidlog to the west of Route 131 so that you can Fly there easily later.
You may want to go the long way and do some training, as well as catch a very useful Wailord on Route 129. This is the only place in the game that you can get one.

, Surf to the north end of Route 131.

, Wallace will appear and say that he's unlocked the door to the Sky Pillar.

, You'll need to use your Mach Bike to cross the cracked sections of the floor. The Sky Pillar is five floors, so you'll be battling quite a bit to make it to the top.


On the fourth floor, you'll need to fall through the second cracked section along the top of the big gap. This will drop you into a blocked area on the third floor. Head up the stairs back to the fourth floor, and then up the stairs again to the fifth.

, It will shake the Sky Pillar and fly off to Sootopolis City.

, You can use Fly from the roof of the Sky Pillar. When you arrive at Sootopolis, you'll see Rayquaza drive off Groudon and Kyogre.

, Archie and Maxie will realize that they've done a bad thing, and return the orbs they stole to Mt. Pyre.

, He will give you HM07 Waterfall, and inform you that you'll need to earn the Rain Badge by defeating the Sootopolis Gym Leader in order to use it. After giving you Waterfall, he will move aside and allow you to enter the Gym.

, Juan, the Gym Leader, uses a Water-type party, with a Level 46 Kingdra as his most powerful Pokemon. Try to have a Dragon-type in your part to quickly take down the Kingdra, and plenty of Grass-type Pokémon to do heavy damage to the Water Pokemon.

, You'll need to walk across the ice in the correct order to make the staircase to the next section appear. Start from the top of the stair case and move the following directions to complete the first puzzle. If you mess up, you'll fall into the basement and be forced to fight trainers.


↑1, ←1, ↑1, →2, ↑1, ←1

, Start from the top of the second staircase and perform the following steps:


↑1, ←3, ↑2, →2, ↓1, →2, ↓1, →2, ↑2, ←3

, This last puzzle is fairly complex, but if you do it correctly you'll end up right in front of Juan:↑1, ←5, ↑3, →1, ↓1, →1, ↓1, →1, ↑2, →1, ↓1, →1, ↓1, →1, ↓1, →1, ↑1, →2, ↓1, →1, ↑3, ←2, ↓1, ←1, ↑1, ←2

, This badge will allow you to use Waterfall outside of battle to climb waterfalls throughout the world. You can now teach HM07 to whichever Pokémon that you want to have it. It is usually best used on the same Pokémon that knows Surf. You'll need Waterfall to access the Elite Four in Ever Grande City.

Link up two Game Boy Advances.,
Go to the Vermillion City Trading Center.,
Make the trade.,
Verify on Emerald that the trade has gone through.",How to Get Eevee in Pokémon Emerald1," While Emerald is sorely lacking in the Eevee department, FireRed and LeafGreen both have a way you can get the Pokemon. If you want to get Eevee without resorting to cheating, you'll need to start a game of either and get at least as far as Celadon City.


It's important to keep in mind you'll need to have collected at least 60 Pokémon and completed the Sevii Islands sidequest to open up trading.;
, Once you've opened up the possibility for the Trade Centre, it's time to find Eevee. Eevee may be found in the Pokémon Mansion in Celadon City. Go to Celadon City, and enter the mansion via the backdoor. Get to the roof; on the roof, you'll find a room. Inside, you'll find Eevee's Pokeball. , In order to trade, you'll need too Game Boy Advances, a copy of Emerald and FireRed or LeafGreen, and a game link cable to join the two. Get it all plugged in before you try to access the Trade Center.


Ask a friend to borrow his Game Boy Advance; this will save you having to purchase another console in order to make the trade.

, With the two devices hooked up, you can now head to Vermillion City and access the Trading Center. Go up to the desk and speak to the hostess. From there, you can access the trade panel.

, Ensure the game link cable is joining the two consoles safely, then proceed to make the trade. The data will be erased on the LeafGreen/FireRed game, and copied onto Emerald.

, Now that you've made the trade, it's always good form to look on your Emerald file and make sure the file has gone through. If the trade has been made, you should see a little Eevee smiling back at you! If for some reason the Eevee isn't there, it's quite possible the trade wasn't completed. It's highly unlikely that one game would erase it without copying on the other, so try again and you should be able to get it down right.

This is also the location most Hoenn centered games start off.;
, For you to trade with another player, you will need at least two Pokémon in your party. Trading works on a principle of demand, or else by virtue of kindness. Many players are willing to help others out by offering spare Pokémon they've collected for trade online or among friends. However, it may help the process if you have a desirable Pokémon to trade.


The Pokémon exclusive to Sapphire, and therefore more valuable to players of other versions, are:

Lotad
Lombre
Ludicolo
Sableye
Seviper
Lunatone
Kyogre, Unlike newer versions of the Pokémon game series where you can make use of a wireless Internet connection, Sapphire will require the Link Cable to perform a trade., Since your Link Cable can only connect Nintendo consoles, like your Gameboy Advance and a Gameboy Color, or even the original Gameboy, you will need another player with a different version/console, one in which Ditto can be caught. When you've found another player with a Ditto who is willing to trade, connect your Gameboys with the Link Cable and get ready to exchange.

, Place the Pokémon you wish to trade for Ditto in your party, then head to the closest Pokémon Center. There you will find a receptionist who will ask you if you'd like to trade Pokémon with another player.Follow the prompts and in a few short moments, Ditto will be in your party.

You will obtain a badge, and this will trigger an event in the Space Center.

, Team Magma has sent a letter to the Space Center informing them that they will be stealing their rocket fuel. By the time you earn the Mind Badge at Mossdeep Gym, Team Magma will attack the center—it's your job to stop them.

Shoal Cave
Victory Road

Capture the Pokemon.,
Train your Pokemon.",How to Get Dig in Pokémon Emerald2," If you have missed out on the TM, you're going to have to find, capture, and train a Pokémon that naturally learns the ability Dig in order to get it. In Pokémon Emerald, there are only two naturally appearing Pokémon in the game that learn Dig: Nincada and Trapinch., Some Pokémon can be found through the in-game world, others are only located in certain areas. Both Nincada and Trapinch, however, can be found in the region of Hoenn. To find these Pokémon you'll need to:


Go to Route 116 to find Nincada. This route is in western Hoenn; it connects to Rustboro City and Rusturf Tunnel. Walk in this area until you randomly encounter Nincada.Travel to Route 111 or Mirage Tower to find Trapinch. Route 111 can be found in the main region of Hoenn. It connects Mauville City to Route 112. The Mirage Tower will appear at random in the desert along Route 111. Walk in this area until you randomly encounter Trapinch., Pokémon have certain weaknesses and strengths. You might use these to your advantage when capturing Nincada and Trapinch. However, you should be careful not to do too much damage; doing so will result in the Pokémon fainting and you having to find a new one to capture.


Nincada is a small bug-type Pokémon with a decent defense power. It is weak against flying, fire, water, and ice type attacks. It is strong against fighting, poison, and ground type attacks.
Trapinch is also a bug-type Pokémon with decent attack power. It is weak against water, grass, and ice type attacks. It is strong against poison and rock attacks.Once Nincada or Trapinch is weakened by your attacks and has low HP, you'll have to throw a Pokeball to capture it. Be sure you have enough of your best Pokeballs in your inventory before leaving to capture one.
If you find that your Pokémon are too strong and do too much damage to either of these wild Pokemon, you might want to use attacks Trapinch and Nincada are strong against. This will do reduced damage. This way, you can do small amounts of damage until the Pokémon is weakened enough for you to catch it.

, You'll have to train Nincada to level 45 before it will learn the ability Dig, and Trapinch doesn't learn the skill until level 41. This means you'll have to fight other non-player trainers, fight randomly encounter Pokemon, use items (like Rare Candy) to raise its level, or take your Pokémon to the Daycare Center where it'll be trained for you."

Load your game with your cheat cartridge.,

Access your game data.",How to Get Dig in Pokémon Emerald3," GameShark is one of the most popular brands of cheat cartridge, but there are many others you might use to get the Dig ability on your game.Due to the fact that you will be using your cheat cartridge to adjust the data of your game, there is a risk that you could corrupt your data or do permanent damage to your game.


Cheat cartridges can be bought at most video game stores and electronics retailers. There are cheat cartridges available through online sellers and digital cheat programs that you can use for computer emulated games.
If you intend on using a GameShark cheat cartridge, be certain you purchase version 2.1 or higher. Lower versions of GameShark will not work on color games., This will bring up the code handler, where you will have to insert a code. You can find lists of codes for your cheat cartridge online. These codes need to be input into your code handler to give you items (like TM28, which teaches Dig), or can be used to add Pokemon that naturally learn the Dig ability to your team.


Some cheat cartridges are buggy or are poorly adapted to certain games. In cases like these, you might have to plug your game into the cheat cartridge several times before it works correctly., The code you use will depend on the way you intend on learning the Dig ability, either by TM or a Pokémon that learns the ability. You should be careful when inputting your code, as a single missed or incorrect character can result in a failed attempt or deleted/corrupted data. Some codes you might use include:The TM28 code: 82005274 013C

Wait for a bite.,
Continue to press the ""A"" button at the right time.,
Fight the Pokémon.",How to Fish in Pokémon Emerald," The fishing rod you are using determines the level of Pokémon that you can catch. You will come across more powerful rods as you travel. There are three rods in the game:Old Rod - This can be obtained from the fisherman near the Dewford Town gym. This will let you catch Pokémon up to level 15 (mostly Magikarp).
Good Rod - This can be obtained from the fisherman on the right side of the river on Route 118. This will let you catch Pokémon up to level 30.
Super Rod - This can be obtained from the fisherman living in the house on the northern cliff in Mossdeep City. This will let you catch any swimming Pokémon.;
, You can fish from any spot directly next to water, or from the back of a surfing Pokémon. You can't fish if you are too high, such as on a cliff.


The chance of finding a certain Pokémon is based on the area, not on your fishing spot. There is no one spot that will be better for catching a specific Pokémon than another. The only exception to this is Feebas, who can only be caught on certain tiles in a specific area.

, Open your menu by pressing Start and select your Rod from the Key Items, or press Select if you've registered your rod as a shortcut. Your character will begin fishing., Once your line is out, the text box will appear at the bottom of the screen. Dots will appear as you wait. If a Pokémon bites, the text ""Oh! A bite!"" will appear. As soon as that happens, press the ""A"" button.


If you don't press ""A"" soon enough, the Pokémon will get away.

, Each time you press the ""A"" button correctly, the waiting period will begin again. The amount of time between bites will change each time. After hitting ""A"" at the right time enough times in a row, you will pull the Pokémon out of the water.

, Pulling the Pokémon out of the water will start a battle. You can defeat the Pokémon or try to catch it. If you are farming for a specific Pokémon and catch the wrong one, the fastest way to get out of the fight is to run away.
