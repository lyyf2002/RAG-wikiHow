Catch Relicanth.,
Catch Wailord.,
Fly to Pacifidlog Town.,
Fly to Lavaridge Town, or somewhere near the Desert.,
Now that you've caught Regirock, it's time for Regice.,
Next on the list is Registeel.,
Congrats on catching the Regi Trio!",How to Find the Regis in Pokémon Emerald,"

Wild Relicanth can be found underwater around Sootopolis City. All you need to do is dive underwater and look in the patches of seaweed. Finding Relicanth might take a while because Clamperl mostly appear, but after a few encounters one will be sure to show up. Using a Dive Ball or a Net Ball would be best because Relicanth has such a low catch rate with other Pokeballs.



 

;
,

Encountering a wild Wailord in the wild is very rare so it would be best to level up Wailmer to level 40. They can be caught with a Super Rod around Dewford Town, etc. Using a Net Ball would be best, also.







, Use Surf and find the area where the currents start. Ride the currents around until you get to a diving spot around Route 134. Use Dive there. You will come to a cave entrance. Go in there and you will find a cave with slabs of rock with Braille on them. Go to the far end of the cave and stand in front of the middle Braille. You need a Pokémon that knows Dig. Now put Wailord in the front of your party and Relicanth last. Have your Dig Pokémon use Dig. An earthquake should occur next.

, Regirock's tomb is located south in the desert. Go inside. Now go to the back wall of the cave. After that, walk two steps left, then two steps down. Now use Rock Smash. The wall should now open. Inside a level 40 Regirock is waiting for you.

, Fly to Petalburg City or Dewford Town and go to Route 105. Regice's cave is located there. Once inside, do a clockwise lap around the cave, staying by the wall the entire time. The door will open. Regice is waiting to be caught inside at the usual level 40.

, It's the hardest one to catch of the three. It's home cave is located on Route 120 so Fly to Fortree City. Once inside, go to the center of the cave and use Flash. The door will now open. Registeel will be inside waiting to be challenged. It is as the usual level 40.

, If you own a Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum version of Pokémon, you can migrate the Trio through Pal Park and catch Regigigas! (Note! Pal Park is only open after you have completed the main story and seen every Pokémon in Sinnoh.)

Fight Latios.",How to Find Latios in Pokémon Emerald," In order to access Latios, you'll first need to beat the main game. See How to Beat the Elite Four on Emerald for more details.;
, After beating the Elite Four, return to your home in Littleroot Town and speak with your mother. A TV show will play and your mother will ask you a question about what appeared.

, This will enable Latios to be found in Hoenn. If you select ""Red"", Latias will roam instead, and you will need an Eon Ticket in order to get Latios.


If you've already selected ""Red"" but want to get Latios as well, click here.

, Latios can be an incredibly difficult Pokémon to catch, as it tries to escape on every turn, forcing you to hunt it down again. Make sure you're prepared before starting your hunt, and it'll make catching Latios much easier.

, If you haven't used your Master Ball, this is one of the best uses for it in the game. The Master Ball will instantly catch Latios when you use it, making it the most efficient way to catch it.


If you have a Master Ball, you don't really need to worry about any other preparations, and can skip down to the next section. If you don't have your Master Ball anymore, read on.

, Latios is an incredibly fast Pokémon, and if you want to have a chance to capture it without a Master Ball, you'll need a Pokémon with a high enough speed that it can act first. Not only that, you'll need a Pokémon that can learn the skill ""Mean Look"". Gengar and Crobat are two of the best candidates that meet both requirements.


Train your Gengar or Crobat up to at least Level 50. This will ensure that they have enough speed to beat Latios.
When leveling up your Gengar or Crobat, make sure that you don't forget the Mean Look skill. Gengar learns it at Level 13, while Crobat learns it at Level 42.
If you want to use the Super Repel trick to make finding Latios easier (see below), use Gengar and keep it at Level 39.

, Another strategy for catching Latios is to use Wobbuffet, who has the Shadow Tag ability. This prevents the enemy Pokémon from escaping.


Train Wobbuffet to Level 39 to use the Super Repel trick (see below).
Make sure that Wobbuffet is the first Pokémon in your party so that it can trap Latios.

, Once Latios is trapped, you'll need to lower its HP so that you can capture it. The best way to do this without risking knocking out Latios is by using a Pokémon with the False Swipe ability. This will lower the enemy Pokémon's health but will never take it below 1 HP. This will ensure that you don't knock Latios out.


It will also help to have a Pokémon with the Paralyze ability to help keep Latios trapped.

, You're likely going to be throwing a lot of Pokeballs at Latios, especially if you're trying to catch it before it flees.

, This item will increase the encounter rate, which will help you find Latios faster. You can get the White Flute from the Glass Workshop on Route 113. You will need to walk 1000 steps in the Soot in order to get it.


Once you have the White Flute, give it to whichever Pokémon is at the head of your party.

, This trick can make finding Latios easier, but requires your lead Pokémon to be Level 39. The Super Repel keeps with Pokémon with lower levels than your lead Pokémon from attacking you. Since Latios is Level 40, you'll need a Level 39 lead Pokémon for this to work.

, Before you try to track Latios down yourself, trade with a friend first if you can. When Latios is added to your Pokedex, you'll be able to see its current location at any time, making tracking it down much easier. If you don't have someone to trade with, read on.


Have a friend trade you their Latios, and then trade it back right away. You simply need to receive it in a trade in order for it to appear in your Pokedex.

, This is a good location to try hunting Latios, as it lets you switch areas quickly to change its location.


Note: If you traded with a friend, use the location in your Pokedex to find Latios instead.

, If you are using the Super Repel trick, take one before you start walking around. Otherwise, walk around until a battle starts.

, If Latios still isn't appearing, you'll want to try changing its location.

, If you aren't finding Latios, enter and exit the Safari Zone. Every time you change areas, Latios moves to a new route. The goal is to keep doing this until it appears in the grass outside of the Safari Zone.


If you traded and are tracking Latios with your Pokedex, don't leave the route that its on until you've found it.

, Once you've finally started the battle, you'll need to trap and then capture Latios.


If you have a Master Ball, throw it immediately to catch Latios.
Make sure to use your trap ability (Shadow Tag, Mean Look) as soon as the battle begins.
If you have Wobbuffet, Mirror Coat is very useful as Latios uses a lot of Special Attacks.
Use Paralyze to help keep Latios from fleeing.
Use False Swipe to get Latios down to 1 HP.
Start throwing Ultra Bars as soon as Latios's health is low.

, Latios will try to run at every opportunity, but once you've encountered it once, you can see its current location on your Pokedex. Travel to its new location and don't leave until you find it again.

, If you accidentally released Latias by answering ""Red"" when you talk to your mother, the only way you can legitimately find Latios is by trading for it. You can use Gameshark codes if you are using an emulator and don't have someone to trade with (see the next steps).

, The Eon Ticket was a special event item that was distributed to players, which allowed players to access a special island where they can catch Latios or Latias, depending on which one they released. Since the ticket is no longer available, you'll need to use cheat codes to get it. To use Gameshark codes, you'll need to be using an emulator like Visual Boy Advance.


While there are codes to get Latios directly, it's recommended that you use the ticket instead. When you add Pokémon using codes, they can be fairly buggy, so use the ticket instead and catch the Latios as the game expects you to. This will also make the Pokémon legitimate for tournaments, as it is not a hacked Pokemon.

, In order to successfully use the Eon Ticket, you'll need to enter a code for both the ticket and the event. You'll also need to enter two Master codes, making four codes total that will need to be entered.


Make sure Pokémon Emerald is running and click the ""Cheats"" menu.
Select ""Cheat list..."" and then click Gameshark... to enter a new cheat code.
Enter the following codes, creating a new code for each separate box. Enter the ""Description"" into the ""Description"" field, and then copy the code into the Code field.

  Description: Eon Ticket

  Description: Southern Island
  0D6A02AA B44948BD

, After entering all of the codes, restart Pokémon Emerald and go to your PC in the game. You should be able to find the Eon Ticket in Slot 1. Withdraw it from the PC and add it to your inventory.

, When you're holding the ticket, you'll be taken to Southern Island instead of Slateport City.

, Once you're on Southern Island, you can fight Latios by using the sphere at the center of the island. Latios won't try to run in this fight, so use the techniques outlined above to wear it down and capture it.

, After saving, walk up to Rayquaza and press A, thus initiating battle. Rayquaza will be level 70, so be prepared for a tough fight.

, To catch it more easily, it is suggested that you freeze it at the beginning of the battle, use False Swipe multiple times so that is gets down to one HP left.

Based on your choice, you may encounter Trainer battles, wild Pokémon, having your Pokémon healed by the maids on duty, or a Trainer whose Pokémon will inflict a status problem to your Pokémon. The Battle Pike tests your luck in making decisions., Before you select a room, there is a maid standing near the rooms. If talked to, she gives a hint as to what to expect in one of the rooms. By heeding her advice, you can save yourself from unnecessary battles or have your Pokémon healed frequently., The main nuisance of the Battle Pike is to be afflicted by status ailments such as poison and paralysis, so it is recommended that you either carry useful berries (such as Pecha or Cheri Berries), or carry Pokémon that are immune to certain status ailments. For example, carrying a Steel-type Pokémon will avoid poisoning, as Poison-type moves do not affect Steel-type Pokémon., The Frontier Brain of the Battle Pike is Lucy, also known as the Pike Queen. She is encountered after you go through 27 and 139 rooms in a streak. This means that Lucy will be in the final room of the 2nd consecutive pass through the Battle Pike for the Silver challenge, and in the final room of the 10th consecutive pass for the Gold challenge. Upon her defeat, she will award the Luck Symbol."

Choose your Pokémon wisely.,
Defeat Spenser.",How to Conquer the Battle Frontier in Pokémon Emerald Version6," Battle Palace is located to the south of the Battle Arena. This facility is unique from the others in the sense that you, the Trainer, do not give any commands to your Pokémon in battle. Instead, the Pokémon fight on its own. For each challenge, you battle Trainers with 3 of your Pokémon. Defeating 7 Trainers successively clears one set in the facility. The Battle Palace tests how close you are with your Pokémon., Natures as well as movesets of the Pokémon entered into a Palace challenge can determine how each battle plays out. There are 3 categories that moves can fall in at the Battle Palace:

Support moves: These include non-damage dealing moves that cause trouble for the opponent in the form of causing status problems, lowering their stats, limiting their movement, etc. The only exceptions are Counter and Mirror Coat. Although these moves deal damage, they do so by redirecting the opponent’s power back at them – unlike normal damage dealing moves that utilizes the user’s own power. Examples of support moves are Poison Powder, Nightmare and Curse.
Defense moves: These include moves that benefit the user in the form of raising their stats, providing protection from attacks, restoring HP, etc. Examples include Withdraw, Protect and Heal Bell.
Attack moves: These are just any other moves that do not fit into the two categories above. These moves directly inflict damage on the opponent. Examples include Thunderbolt, Tackle and Focus Punch.

, The Frontier Brain of the Battle Palace is Spenser, also known as the Palace Maven. He is encountered after the 20th and 41st wins in a streak (Gold Symbol). This means that Spenser will be the final Trainer of the 3rd consecutive set through the Battle Palace for the Silver challenge, and the 6th consecutive set for the Gold. Upon his defeat, he will award the Spirits Symbol."

Defeat the main story of the game by beating the Elite Four and the Champion.,
Get to the Battle Tower.,
Gather a team of strong Pokémon.,
Prepare for battle.,
Choose your team.,
Battle!,
Win the next seven matches.,
Enjoy your victory.",How to Defeat the LV. 100 Battle Tower in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire,";
, In post-game, after defeating the Champion, Professor Birch will award you with an S.S. Ticket. This item allows you to board a cruise ship to the final frontier of the game: the Battle Tower. Take either the cruise ship to the Battle Tower, or have a Pokémon use Fly to the location if you have already taken the ship.

, You want to make sure they are each within the LV. 85 - 100 range; otherwise it will most definitely be impossible to beat the Tower. Anything lower will generally result in a one-hit KO from the opposing Pokémon.


Pokémon eggs and legendary Pokémon are forbidden by Tower rules. However, lower-tier legendaries are allowed. The lower tier legendaries tend to be legendary Pokémon that run in trios. The entire list for this game is as follows: Articuno, Moltres, Zapdos, Entei, Raikou, Suicune, Regirock, Registeel, Regice, Latios and Latias.

, Equip each one of the Pokémon with a hold item (many hold items can be won in the Tower after battle 42, for each consecutive win of 7). Leftovers, Choice Band, and Focus Band are generally a good three to use.


You should use Leftovers because of the healing properties it has (it will heal some HP (hit points) to your Pokémon at the end of every turn).
You can use Choice Band because it will significantly raise the attack of one move your Pokémon can use. The key here is to attach the band to a Pokémon you know only one move is necessary for. For example, you can use it on Hariyama and have him/her use Brick Break, which is pretty effective universally except for on Ghost-types.
Using Focus Band is a great decision because it will save your Pokémon from fainting occasionally when hit by an opponent, giving you the extra attack you may need to win. In addition, a Pokémon specializing in defense, one specializing in special attack, and one specializing in attack are a sure-fire way to win.

, The order cannot be switched until you either lose or you have won consecutively seven times in a row. Be wary that the enemies increase in difficulty as you advance. Their attacks will become more competent, they will target your weaknesses, and the opposing trainer will begin to use specific strategies, such as having all three of their Pokémon know Explosion/Self-Destruct, which is extremely harmful to you and your team.

, Pay attention to type match-ups, switch out team members if need be, and win. The key during the battle step is to focus and not make any mistakes, such as using ineffective attacks.


After winning seven consecutive rounds of seven battles (49 battles), the desk attendant will tell you that for each seven battles you win from this point on, you will get awarded with a ribbon. Which is of course, the goal you are striving for.

, Be extremely careful because the enemies are ruthless and many are lower-tier legendaries like Latios or Regirock. The game, at this point especially, is trying to get you to lose, as this ribbon is a grand prize of sorts for the game.

, After winning Battle 56, each one of the three Pokémon you used for the last seven matches will each get a ribbon and as long as you don’t lose, each consecutive win of 7 will get the ribbon for other Pokémon. Good luck, and remember that it may take more than one try.

Know your facility.,
Defeat Anabel.",How to Conquer the Battle Frontier in Pokémon Emerald Version7," The Battle Tower, which was introduced in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, makes its return in Pokémon Emerald. It is the most standard of the facilities in the sense that there are no special rules here – The objective is just to keep a winning streak for as long as possible. In a Battle Tower challenge, you face Trainers using 3 of your Pokémon. Defeat 7 Trainers in succession in order to clear a set. The Battle Tower tests your ability to keep your win streak going., The Frontier Brain of the Battle Tower is Anabel, also known as the Salon Maiden. She is encountered after the 34th and 69th wins in a streak. This means that Anabel will be the final Trainer of the 5th and 10th consecutive sets. Upon her defeat, she will award the Ability Symbol."

Know your facility: The Battle Pyramid, located in the top right corner of the Battle Frontier, is a large orange pyramid comprising of 7 floors completely enveloped in darkness.,
Hunt for items.,
Use Pokémon that can adapt.,
Defeat Brandon.",How to Conquer the Battle Frontier in Pokémon Emerald Version8," Using 3 of your Pokémon, you must navigate the dark passageways and climb the pyramid floors until you reach the top. In addition, the player will not be allowed to carry their Bag inside. Instead, a special Bag is provided for item gathering during the challenge. In addition to finding items, you may also encounter Trainers and wild Pokémon. If you clear 7 floors successively and climb to the top of the Battle Pyramid, you clear a set. Furthermore, every time a set is cleared, the inside mazes change. As you are basically walking blind, the Battle Pyramid tests your bravery in the face of the unknown., The Battle Pyramid is the only facility in which you can freely customize the items that you give your Pokémon. Since the floors change with each run through the pyramid, the items will also change. It is a good idea to collect as many different items as possible, as well as keeping your floor streak up., With each run through the Battle Pyramid, you will encounter wild Pokémon which will either be of a certain type, or will know moves that cause a status ailment. Therefore, it is a good idea to carry Pokémon with either abilities or moves that cancel or counter these problems. With regards to status problems, the following list shows how to cure/prevent each possible ailment:

Poison – Pecha Berry, the Ability Immunity
Paralysis – Cheri Berry, the Ability Limber
Confusion – Persim Berry, the Ability Own Tempo
Sleep – Chesto Berry, the Abilities Vital Spirit or Insomnia
Burn – Rawst Berry, the Ability Water Veil
Freezing – Aspear Berry, the Ability Magma Armor
Infatuation – Mental Herb, the Ability Oblivious

, The Frontier Brain of the Battle Pyramid is Brandon, also known as the Pyramid King. He is encountered after the 21st and 70th floors in a streak. This means that Brandon will be at the peak of the pyramid of the 5th and 10th consecutive sets. Upon his defeat, he will award the respective Brave Symbol."

You get HM03 (Surf) for defeating Norman, the Petalburg Gym leader. Dive can be obtained from Steven in Mossdeep City.;
, You'll need to have beaten at least the first seven gyms to be able to access all of the moves you need to get the Regis. After defeating Tate & Liza in Mossdeep Gym, you'll gain the ability to use Dive in deep water. This is the last necessary skill to unlock the Regis.

, This is a rare Pokémon that can only be found in Underwater areas. In Ruby and Sapphire, use Dive on Route 124 and 126 to try to encounter a Relicanth, which has a 5% chance of appearing. In Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby, you can find additional Underwater areas on Routes 107, 129, and 130. There are also several underwater areas scattered throughout the world.

, You can fish for Wailmer in most areas in the game. Once you level Wailmer up to level 40, it will evolve into Wailord. You can also try to catch a Wailord by surfing around on Route 129, though it only has a 1% chance of appearing.

, This is the easiest place to start your Surf. If you miss the right currents, you can fly back to Pacifidlog Town and try again.

, This will take you to Route 132 in a moment.

, Walk across the island and then surf again to the shallow spot. Walk around to the other side and then Surf again from the southwestern side of the shallow spot.

, Walk to the far-western side of the island. Make sure that you are at least three steps down from the top of the shore, and at least three steps up from the bottom of the shore.

, The currents should drag you directly to the dark spot of the water that you can Dive into.

, You can find the dark spot in the bottom-right corner of Route 134, surrounded by six rocks.

, This will be on the other side of a loop in the cave.

, You will surface in the Sealed Chamber.

, There will be lots of Braille inscriptions in the cave, but you're looking for the one along the back wall of the cave. The Braille inscription reads ""DIG HERE"".

, Walk up directly to the inscription and face into it. Use the Dig command. This will make a door appear in the wall.

, Relicanth will need to be the first Pokémon in your party list, and Wailord will need to be the last. Use your party screen to reorganize your Pokemon.

, If Relicanth is first and Wailord is last, an earthquake will occur. This indicates that the doors to the Island Cave, Desert Ruins, and the Ancient Tomb have all been opened around the world. These three doors lead to the three Regis., Regice is a level 40 Pokemon, but it is recommended that your party be at least level 50 in order to stand a chance. A common strategy to weaken Regice without knocking it out is to use a Pokémon with the False Swipes move. This lowers the enemy's health without knocking it out. Another common strategy is to try to put the opponent to Sleep or to Paralyze it. This will increase your chances of capturing the Pokemon.

, Ultra Balls will give you the best chance to catch Regice. Depending on Regice's health and status effects, you may need quite a few Ultra Balls.

, The Island Cave on the western side of the route will be open now. Head into this cave.

, The Braille inscription asks you to wait ""twice"", which means you need to sit and not move for two minutes. Set your game down for a few minutes so that you don't accidentally move your character. If you do move, exit the cave and try again. After two minutes, a door will open.

, You'll only have one chance to fight Regice, so make sure you save before fighting. This will allow you to reload your game if you accidentally knock out Regice before capturing it, or if it wipes your party out.

, Walk up to Regice and begin the fight. Whittle down its health and then try to put it to Sleep or Paralyze it. Once Regice is in the red and is asleep or frozen, start throwing Ultra Balls at it., If you want to be able to capture Regigigas, you'll need to give Regice a nickname. You can do this as soon as you capture it, or you can take Regice to a Name Rater to give it a new name. The Name Rater can be found to the south of the Contest Hall in Slateport City.

, This move is required to gain access to Regirock.

, Like the other Regis, Regirock is a level 40 Pokemon. Bring Water Pokémon to land effective hits. Bring along a Pokémon that can put Regirock to Sleep or Paralyze it, as well as a Pokémon that has False Swipes. Finally, make sure you're stocked up on Ultra Balls.

, You'll find the Desert Ruins on the east side of the Route.

, The Braille gives you instructions on waht you need to do to access Regirock.


Walk two steps to the right and then two steps down.
Use Strength at this spot and the door will appear.

, You only get one shot at Regirock, so you'll definitely want to save before approaching it. This will allow you to quickly reload your game and try again if something goes wrong.

, Start the battle with Regirock. Use your Water-type Pokémon to take out big chunks of Regirock's health, and then use False Swipes to lower it as low as possible without knocking it out. Hit Regirock with Sleep or Paralyze, and then start throwing Ultra Balls at it.

, You'll need this move to open the door to Registeel.

, Like the other two Regis, Registeel is a level 40 Legendary Pokemon. It is a Steel-type, which will make it tough to damage. Bring Fighting, Ground, or Fire-type Pokémon to do good damage to Registeel. Also bring a Pokémon that knows False Swipes, as this will allow you to lower Registeel's health without knocking it out. If you can bring a Pokémon that knows Sleep or Paralyze, that can help you capture Registeel. Bring Ultra Balls as well!

, The cave of the Ancient Ruins is on the western side of the Route.

, The Braille inscription gives you instructions for accessing Registeel.


Move to the middle of the room.
Use the Fly move and the door will open.

, You only get one chance to catch Registeel, so make sure that your game is saved right before starting the fight. This will allow you to reload and retry if you accidentally knock it out.

, Start the fight and lower Registeel's health as fast as possible with your Fighting, Ground, and Fire moves. Use False Swipes to lower Registeel's health without knocking it out. Once it's health is in the red, put it to sleep or paralyze it, then start throwing Ultra Balls., You cannot encounter Regigigas until you have defeated the Legendary Pokémon that is wreaking havoc in your game.

, You'll need Regirock, Registeel, and Regice in your party in order to encounter Regigigas.

, If you didn't give Regice a nickname when you caught it, travel to Slateport City and speak to the Name Rater. You can name Regice anything, it just needs to have a nickname before you can encounter Regigigas.

, Your Regice needs to be holding a Snowball, an Icy Rock, a Never-Melt Ice, or a Casteliacone.


Snowballs can be won at the Battle Maison, or found on wild Snorunts.
Icy Rocks can be found at the Weather Institute.
Never-Melt Ice can be found in Shoal Cave.
Casteliacones can be won from the Contest Hall or bought in Mauville City if you have Regice in your party.

, This is the cave that you found Regice in. Make sure that you visit during the daytime, as Regigigas does not appear at night.

, The fight will begin as soon as you enter the cave if you meet the requirements. Save before entering, since you only get one shot at Regigigas.

, Unlike the three Golems, Regigigas is Level 50, so you'll likely be in for a tough fight. Regigigas is weak to Fighting-type Pokemon, so use these to take down the majority of its health. Once its health is low, use False Swipes to drop it lower without knocking it out. Use Ultra Balls once its health is almost gone.

, This will prompt you to enter a new code.

, If you want to use a Master Ball to catch Mew but don't have yours anymore, you can cheat to get as many as you'd like. Enter the following code and the next time you enter a Poke Mart, all of the stock will be free Master Balls.

8BB602F7 8CEB681A

, Open the Cheat list again and enter a new Gameshark code. The following code will take you to Faraway Island, where Mew can be found.8DEB234A 4C8DC5EC


Since you are cheating to get to Faraway Island, and not to specifically get Mew, your Mew should appear legitimate when checked for hacks.

, Once you've entered the code, walk through a door or change locations to automatically teleport to the Faraway Island.

, After you've teleported to Faraway Island, you'll need to disable the code or else you won't be able to change locations again. Open the Cheats list and uncheck the Faraway Island code., By following the winding path through the forest, you should be able to find the entrance to another area. The entrance to the second area will have a deep shade of green beneath the trees. This will take you deeper into the forest. Once you enter this second area, you'll see Mew ahead of you.


The entrance to the second forest area is located on the right side of the forest at the top of the hill.
If you walk through the entrance and are taken back to the start of Faraway Island, you'll need to disable the Faraway Island teleport code. This code will teleport you back to the start of Faraway Island every time you try to change locations.

, Mew will continue to run away from you as you chase it through the grass. The grass will shake to show where Mew is running. You'll need to chase it down until you can corner it. Once you have Mew cornered, talk to it to begin the battle.

, If you have a Master Ball, you can throw it immediately to catch Mew. If you don't have a Master Ball, you'll need to lower Mew's health.

, If you need to catch Mew with traditional Poke Balls, you'll need to lower its health so that the bar turns red first.


The easiest way to do this without knocking Mew out is to use False Swipe. This will lower Mew's health, but will not drop it below 1.
Putting Mew to Sleep or Paralyzing it will make it much easier to catch.

, Once you've captured Mew, you can leave the island. Return to the bottom of the hill to take the boat back to Lilycove City.

Travel to the location that Latias is marked.",How to Catch Latias in Pokémon Sapphire," You won't be able to find Latias until after you have defeated the Elite Four and become the Champion. Click here for tips on defeating the Elite Four.;
, After the credits complete, you'll be taken back to your room. Go downstairs and watch the television. You'll receive a message that a red flying Pokémon has been spotted. This is Latias.

, You'll be doing a lot of walking while looking for Latias, so it's highly recommended that you stock up on Max Repels. These items will keep wild Pokémon from attacking if they are lower-level than your lead Pokémon.


If you've already used your Master Ball, you'll need lots of Ultra Balls.

, Latias is incredibly fast, and will run at the first opportunity. You'll need a Pokémon that will be fast enough to act first, as well as have an ability that can keep Latias trapped. This isn't as important if you have a Master Ball.


A Level 35-39 Wobbuffet is one of the most popular lead Pokémon due to its Shadow Tag ability. This will keep Latias from escaping, and you can swap out to one of your fighters.
Another popular choice is a Level 39 Golbat with the Mean Look ability. The Golbat will usually be able to act first, and the Mean Look ability will keep Latias from running.
Give your starting Pokémon the Quick Claw. This will increase the chances that you will have the first attack.

, One of the best moves for lowering a Pokémon's health without knocking it out is False Swipe. This will damage the opposing Pokémon, but will not lower its health below 1. This makes the Pokémon much easier to capture.


If you're using the Master Ball, you don't need to worry about lowering Latias's health.

, If you have a friend with Latias, trade with them and then trade the Latias back. Adding Latias to your Pokedex will allow you to track it on the map, making it easier to find.

, Latias appears at random around Hoenn, and changes locations every time you enter a building or move to a different area. You can speed up the hunt by finding a place that allows you to fight and change locations quickly. A popular spot is the tall grass outside of the Safari Zone.

, If your lead Pokémon is Level 39, the Max Repel will keep all Pokémon Level 39 and lower from attacking you. Since Latias is Level 40, this increases the chances that you'll face Latias in a battle (if it's in the area)., If it is not Latias, either defeat the Pokémon or flee. Repeat this until you've either encountered about 10-20 Pokémon. If after that many encounters you still haven't seen Latias, there's a good chance that it's not in your area.

, Latias will move to another random area in Hoenn. Enter the tall grass and start trying to find Latias again., You don't need to move to different areas, you just need to keep resetting Latias's position until it is in your area. Eventually you will encounter Latias.

, Your Master Ball will make quick work of Latias, allowing you to capture it immediately. If you don't have a Master Ball, you'll need to lower Latias's health before capturing it.

, This will allow you to then switch to a heavy-hitting Pokémon to start taking down Latias's health.

, You can increase your chances if you can put Latias to Sleep or Paralyze it. You'll likely have to throw multiple Ultra Balls before Latias is captured.

, There's a good chance that Latias will run when you fight it for the first time. Luckily, you're given a few advantages for finding it again. First, Latias's location will be shown on your map after you've encountered it once. Second, Latias will not regenerate health between fights, meaning if you lowered its health significantly the first time, you don't have to worry about doing it again.

, Walk around in the tall grass using Max Repels until you encounter it. Repeat this process until you've captured Latias.

, Latios is a roaming Pokémon and will be found just about anywhere. To make Latios easier to catch, you'll want to go in an area where you can reload easily, such as opening up a cave near a field using a secret power.

, Search around through the grass or other environment until you find Latios. Don't waste time fighting other Pokémon; run from any other battles. If you haven't found Latios in an area after 5 minutes of running around, exit the area and reenter.

You'll have to defeat all of them in one go, or else you start over, so make sure you're prepared.


Stock up on Hyper Potions. These are the most cost-effective potions in the game. Most Pokémon won't have more than 200 HP, making these just as effective as a Max Potion for much less money.
Stock up on Revives as well. You'll want to be able to bring back your key Pokémon between rounds.
Make sure your party is Level 56 or higher. Every Pokémon in your main party should be at least Level 56 before you take on the Elite Four. If you have Rayquaza, use it in this battle since it is much higher level than the Elite Four's and Champion's Pokemon.
Save after you beat each Elite Four member. This will allow you to reload instead of starting over from the beginning.
See How to Beat the Elite Four on Emerald for more details.;
, Kyogre is a Level 70 Pokemon, so you'll want a party that can take a beating and keep fighting. Leveling your entire party will take a while, so you can probably focus on just raising a few of your most powerful Pokemon. Rayquaza will be a big help, since it is Level 70 when you catch it. Grass- and Electric-type attacks will help quickly lower Kyogre's health.


You'll need to have a Pokémon that knows Dive in order to access the cave that Kyogre is in.

, Net Balls are the most effective Poke Balls to use against Water-type Pokemon. Try to have at least 40 of them in your bag. Timer Balls are also very useful, and are more effective than Net Balls after the 30th turn.


Make sure to do all of your prep before you go hunting Kyogre, as it won't stay in one place for very long.
If you have your Master Ball, you can use it on Kyogre to catch it instantly. You only have one though!

, Once you are given control of the game after beating it, use Fly to quickly head to Fortree City. Head west onto Route 119 and enter the Weather Institute in the northwest corner.

, Kyogre's location varies, and if Groudon is active you'll have to either catch it first or wait for the weather to change.


If the scientist says that there is ""Heavy downpour"" on a certain route, this is where you can find Kyogre. Possible routes include Route 105, Route 125, Route 127, and Route 129.
If the scientist says that there is a ""drought"" on a certain route, that means that Groudon is active. You'll need to either go to this location to catch Groudon, or wait for the weather to change and then speak to the scientist again. See How to Catch Groudon for more details.

, Fly to the nearest city and then head to the route that the scientist told you about. You'll notice rain and lightning as you walk around.

, A dark spot will appear in the water when it is raining. This spot changes depending on the location, so you'll just have to Surf around until you find it.

, Use Dive when you're on the dark spot in the water, and you'll end up in an underwater cave.

, At the back of the underwater cave, you'll see an entrance. Swim through it.

, Once you pass through the entrance, you'll be prompted to surface. This will take you to the Marine Cave.

, Create a save here before fighting Kyogre. This will allow you to quickly reload in case you accidentally knock out Kyogre or your party gets wiped. If Kyogre gets knocked out, it will disappear forever, so you'll need to reload your saved game.

, Make your way through the cave and approach the pool that Kyogre is in. It will swim up to you and the fight will begin.

, Use Grass- and Electric-type moves to take large chunks of Kyogre's health. You'll want it in the red before you start trying to use Poke Balls.


If you want to use your Master Ball to catch Kyogre, simply throw it at the start of the fight and Kyogre will be caught instantly. Remember, you only get one Master Ball.

, Net Balls will give you the best chance to catch Kyogre, so start throwing them once its health is in the red. Throw a ball every turn that you can.


Kyogre has a move that will put it to sleep and completely restore its health. Don't be disheartened! Your chances of capturing it actually increase while it's asleep, so keep throwing balls. Once it wakes up, take its health back down.

, Once 30 turns have passed, Timer Balls become more effective than Net Balls. Make the switch to improve your chances.

, Kyogre has a move that that damages itself as it damages you. This means it may knock itself out. When knocked out, Kyogre disappears forever. If this happens, you'll need to reset and reload your game. You'll also want to reload if you get knocked out, since Kyogre will move and you'll have to start all over."

Have your Pokémon ready.,
Buy tons of Ultra Balls.,
Use your abilities.",How to Catch Latios in Pokémon Ruby2," You're going to need a Level 40 Pokémon to take on Latios. Get a Trapinch or a Wobbuffet or any high level Pokémon that knows Mean Look (such as a Golbat or Crobat). Give a Pokémon that has Mean Look the Quick Claw ability and buy some Carbos for it (to be sure it's a top speed). Put this Pokémon at the top of your party.


Wobbuffet and Trapinch are useful because their Shadow Tag (Wobbuffet) and Arena Trap (Trapinch) abilities will keep Latios from escaping.

, These will be your best bet for catching Latios. A regular Poke Ball is not recommended.

, If you chose Trapinch or Wobbuffet, whittle down his HP and throw tons of Ultra Balls. Otherwise, use Mean Look right at the beginning of the fight. If you make Latios faint, reset. If he gets away, you can now track him with your Pokedex, in the style you use to track the legendary dogs in G/S/C.

Use a Pro Action Replay code.",How to Catch Feebas in Pokémon Emerald," This is the only area in Pokémon Emerald that Feebas can be found. #*Route 119 is located in the top-center of the map, and connects Fortree City and Route 118.


You will need the bike to reach the area above the waterfall.
Bring a Pokémon with the Surf ability so that you can reach any water tile.;
, There are hundreds of water tiles in Route 119, but Feebas can only be found on six of them at any one time. These six tiles are random, and the spot you find Feebas will likely not be the same spot that your friend does.

,, Any rod will allow you to catch a Feebas, but the Super Rod only catches Feebas and Carvahna, making it easier to tell if you’re successful or not.

, Start at the top of the river, and move back and forth as you make your way south. Make sure to stop at every tile possible.

, Feebas won’t always show up the first time you fish a tile. To ensure that you don’t accidentally skip a good tile, fish each spot at least five times.

.

Carvahna can appear in the same tile as Feebas.

, Once you’ve located a Feebas, catch a few extra while you’re there. You can catch multiple Feebas from the same spot, and the spots don’t change once you leave the area. You can use your extra Feebas to trade with people who don’t want to spend the time tracking one down.

, If you feel like shuffling the tiles will help you find Feebas, you can speak to the boy outside of the Dewford town hall. Entering a new “Trendy Phrase” will shuffle the tiles where Feebas can be found. Even if the tiles are shuffled, Feebas can still only be found in Route 119.

There is no trendy phrase that makes finding Feebas “easier”. Each trendy phrase simply shuffles the tiles where it can be found around, and the same phrase on two games will result in different tile locations.
You can find a Feebas without setting a Trendy Phrase at all.

, If you feel like taking a little shortcut to getting your Feebas, you can use the Pro Action Replay cheat code system to generate Feebas for you to easily capture. You will need to enter two codes in order to make Feebas become the next Pokémon you encounter in the wild.Master code:

Walk around on the small piece of land until you encounter Bagon.,
Use a Pokémon with False Swipe to lower Bagon's health.,
Use Sleep or Paralyze to trap the Bagon.,
Throw an Ultra Ball for the best chances of capturing Bagon.",How to Catch Bagon in Pokémon Emerald," You'll need to complete most of the game's story before you can get Waterfall. This Hidden Move is required in order to access the area where you can find Bagon. Waterfall allows you to travel up waterfalls throughout the world. You'll get the Mind Badge in Mossdeep City.;
, After getting the Mind Badge, you'll gain the ability to use Dive while traveling. Use this in the deep blue water south of Mossdeep to find the Seafloor Cavern.

, If you've already been to Sootopolis, you can use Fly to reach it quickly. Find Steven on the north side of Sootopolis City.

, You'll be asked by Steven to find Wallace in the Cave of Origin. Talk to Wallace and answer ""SKY PILLAR"".

, You can get to the Sky Pillar from Pacifidlog Town. Rayquaza will fly off and head to Sootopolis City. Use Fly to follow.

, You'll find Rayquaza fighting of Groudon and Kyogre, and then it will fly off. Speak to Steven outside of the Sootopolis Gym, and then speak to Wallace. Wallace will give you HM07 as a thank you for saving the town.

, After getting Waterfall, you won't be able to use it outside of battle until you get the Rain Badge from the Sootopolis Gym. This is the final Gym in the game, so make sure that you're properly prepared for tough fights. Once you get the Rain Badge, you'll be able to use Waterfall around the world., You have already visited this cave earlier in the story, so Fly to Fallarbor Town to quickly reach Meteor Falls Cave. The cave is located between Route 114 and 115.

, After you enter Meteor Falls Cave, you'll come to a pool of water. Walk to the north and use Surf to travel across the water.

, Approach the waterfall and press ""A"" to bring up the prompt to use Waterfall.

, After climbing the waterfall, you'll see a small piece of land and a cave entrance. Get off on this small piece and walk through the entrance.

, Head to the right and then up a little bit to find a ladder. Take the ladder down to the lower level.

, You'll be challenged by a duo of trainers. After defeating them, use the stairs to climb to the top of the room.

, The ladder you need to reach is in the bottom-left corner of the room. Skip down the ledges and stay left to reach the ladder.

, Make your way to the north side of the room and get off on the piece of land with the cave entrance.

, This room is long and narrow, and you'll have to Surf across the water to cross the room. Get off on the small piece of land at the top of the room.

, This small patch of dry land is the only area in the entire game that you can encounter Bagon. Bagon has a 20% chance of appearing when you encounter a wild Pokémon here, so it may take several battles until one appears., False Swipe is a great move for capturing Pokémon, as it can reduce the wild Pokémon's health down to 1 HP but will never knock it out. Farfetch'd, Cubone, Scizor, and Nincada are some of the Pokémon that can learn this move by leveling up, or you can use TM54 to teach it to a different Pokémon.


If you don't have a Pokémon with False Swipe, you can use regular moves to lower Bagon's health as much as you can without knocking it out.

, These moves will increase the chances of your Poke Ball capturing Bagon. There are lots of Pokémon that can learn moves that cause these conditions, and chances are you already have at least one.

, Ultra Balls are expensive, but they can catch the Bagon much more reliably than other balls. If you've lowered Bagon's health to 1 HP and it is asleep or paralyzed, just about any Poke Ball should do the trick,

Train the other Pokémon to level 50 or higher.,

Gloom (lvl 52)

Ninetails (lvl 51)
Kadabra (lvl 56)
Machoke (lvl 55)
Raichu (lvl 58)

, If you have a line-up as described in the previous step, it should be simple to beat the elite four. Note that you can even have them in the high 40's, (48-52), and still manage to beat the elite four.

, This is very important or you might have to start all over again.

"
The first Pokémon of hers is a Swablu.,
Next is Tropius, a Flying/Grass-type.,

Skarmory is next, and harder than any Pokémon you ever fought.,
Altaria, the final Pokémon, uses Earthquake, which doesn't help at all.",How to Beat the 6th Gym Leader in Pokémon Emerald," Be careful, because it has the move Perish Song, which can take you out in 3 moves.;
, Use a flying or fire move, and you can have a nice win against it.

, It usually uses Protect, and confuses you. Use an Electric-type, like Manectric, as Pelliper has a 4x weakness to it.

, Don't use Flying or Steel-type moves, or you're in trouble. Use a water move like Surf or Water Gun, or use fire moves. Skarmory is also weak to Electric-type moves.

, Dragon Dance, which raises attack and speed, which isn't good when it uses Aerial Ace. Don't use Ground-types, and you can win the battle.

It's time to beat the Elite Four!,Here's the list of the trainers of the Elite Four of Ruby and Sapphire~

,
Sidney: Mightyena, dark, level 46.,
Phoebe: Dusclops, ghost, level 48.,
Glacia: Glalie, ice, level 50.,
Drake: Shelgon, dragon, level 52.,
Steven: Skarmory, steel/flying, level 57.,
In Pokémon Emerald, the only difference is the last member of the Elite Four:

,
Wallace: Wailord, water, level 57.,
As you can see, there are some trainers who are tough to beat, like Drake and Steven/Wallace.

,
To beat the Elite Four, I recommend you to choose Torchic as a starter.,
Phoebe is a very tricky trainer because there are good ghost Pokémon with good Sp.,
For Drake, a fast Salamence will do the job.,
Catch Magneton!,
Steelix (evolved from Onix) is a good Pokémon because you can switch into it easily (except fire and water types because of special attacks).,
As for the last Pokémon, a grass type.,
So, there's the list of Pokémon i recommend to beat the Elite Four:

,
Blaziken: Fire Blast, Sky Uppercut, Bulk Up (sometimes you'll need some defense), Flamethrower (because Fire Blast misses some times)

,
Salamence (level 60 to beat Drake's Salamence in Speed): Earthquake, Dragon Claw, Fire Blast, Hydro Pump (if you can get an egg move) or Dragon Dance

,
Starmie: Ice Beam, Thunderbolt (great combo with Ice Beam), Surf/Hydro Pump (accuracy/power), Recover

,
Magneton: Thunderbolt, Zap Cannon, Lock-on (awesome combination with Zap Cannon), Thunder Wave (to paralyze faster enemies)

,
Steelix: Earthquake, Iron Tail, Toxic (combines with Steelix's great defense), Roar

,
1st choice - Sceptile: Leaf Blade, Dragon Claw (can help you with Drake), Brick Break, Hyper Beam (last resort move)

,
2nd choice - Ludicolo: Surf/Hydro Pump (same thing as Starmie), Rain Dance, Giga Drain, Leech Seed (annoying healing set)

,
Choose Swift Swim for speed and Rain Dish for HP.","How to Beat the Elite Four on Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald"," First of all, I recommend to put all your pokemons in level 55-60 because the champion will cause you a lot of pain if you don't do it.;
,, Shiftry, dark/grass, level 48. Cacturne, dark/grass, level 46. Sharpedo, dark/water, level 48. Absol, dark, level 49.

, Banette, ghost, level 49. Sableye, ghost/ dark, level 50. Banette, ghost, level 49. Dusclops, ghost, level 51.

, Sealeo, ice/water, level 50. Sealeo, ice/water, level 52. Glalie, ice, level 52. Walrein, ice/water, level 53.

, Altaria, dragon/flying, level 54. Flygon, dragon/ground, level 53. Flygon, dragon/ground, level 53. Salamence, dragon/flying, level 55.

, Claydol, ground/psychic, level 55. Aggron, steel/rock, level 56. Cradily, rock/grass, level 56. Armaldo, rock/bug, level 56. Metagross, steel/psychic, level 58.

,, Milotic, water, level 58. Tentacruel, water/poison, level 55. Ludicolo, water/grass, level 56. Gyarados, water/flying, level 56. Whiscash, water/ground, level 56.

,, In the final form (Blaziken), it learns powerful fighting moves such as Sky Uppercut, which will be very useful to beat Sidney (dark type trainer), Glacia (ice type trainer, but IMPORTANT, most of her Pokémon are part water type too, so be careful) and Steven (steel type which is covered by fighting and fire moves).

, Attack but, unfortunately, ghost moves are physical in this game (poor Gengar). The same goes for dark types. Good Attack but dark moves are special in this game. So, to beat Phoebe, use all your Pokémon.

, Besides dragon moves being special in the game, Salamence can still win. A water Pokémon will be useful too if it can learn Ice Beam (Starmie will be a great choice).

, Apparently, it may not be a great choice but you're wrong if you think that way. Awesome Special Attack and average Speed will make it one of the best electric types in the game. Use Magneton against Glacia and Wallace.

, If you are having a problem, change into steelix and just use roar on your opponent.

, It will resist a lot of Wallace's Pokémon attacks and if it is faster, use it to beat Glacia. I recommend Sceptile, but if you can't get it, use Ludicolo.

,,,,,,,,, Good Luck beating the Elite Four! ;) -Miguel

Level up your Pokémon to get the best stats possible.,
Be diverse with your party.,
Make sure you have a Pokémon who knows a move that would be considered super effective against the gym leader's primary type of Pokémon.,
Understand STAB bonuses.,
Keep an eye on items.","How to Beat the Gym Leaders in Pokémon Emerald, Ruby or Sapphire1"," By the end of the game, you should have most of your Pokémon near level 50. Check out the levels of each gym leader below to see where you should be -- you want most of your party of 6 Pokémon to be at or above the level of the gym leaders to be assured of victory.
, Build your party with dual-type Pokémon. A dual-type is a Pokémon with two primary types like Magneton, who is Electric and Steel Type, rather than just one type like Pikachu, who is only electric type. When you use dual-type Pokémon, they have the ability to learn two or more different types of moves. The more dual type Pokémon you have, the more move types you have under your belt.

You want to cover your weaknesses. If you are wondering what Pokémon are strong/weak against other types, check out this comprehensive chart.


, For example, you would want to use water or grass type moves against a rock type gym leader like Roxanne., Make sure that the Pokémon you use is the same type as the move you want to use. This makes your move 25% more effective. For example, a water type move done with a water type Pokémon is more effective against rock than a grass type Pokémon using that same water type move, if it can even be learned., Throughout the game, you should be collecting items, whether as part of scripted events or by scavenging stray Poké Balls. Certain items can be given to Pokémon to increase certain attributes or to help in battle. Try and have all of your Pokémon holding a helpful item.

You'll need to purchase several potions and revives at the Poké Mart. It's best to be smart about whether to use regular, super, hyper, or max potions depending on how much money you have and what each of your Pokémons' max hp's are. These helpful items can give you that extra edge during battle."
"
Train your Pokémon equally.,
Each Pokémon's 'personality' differs and they all grow differently.,
Catch and use Legendary Pokémon such as Kyogre, Groudon or Rayquaza.,
Team Aqua and Team Magma really like two common Pokémon types: Poison and Dark types, much like Team Rocket or Team Galactic.,
Take full advantage of all the in-game items and bonuses; they can really help!

,
If you want a complete walkthrough, look it up on a cheater's walkthrough website.",How to Beat Pokémon Emerald," Don't train just one Pokémon and leave the rest weak, which gives you a disadvantage, especially if you come against a type disadvantage.


Every gym is different, plan ahead and train specific Pokémon to battle. Have one back-up of similar type, just in case your main Pokémon faints.;
, Make sure to take advantage of those different personalities.

, They come between levels 50-80 and can be much stronger than other Pokémon, if trained right. However, this is a cheap way to win, and they won't always be the best just because they're Legendary Pokémon. For example, many Pokémon like Metagross and Salamence are more commonly used in the competitive battling metagame.


Even if you get the legendary Pokémon, still train the regular Pokémon up. You want power to battle, plus, it's fun just to train. Keep in mind what was said above -- Legends can often ruin the fun of the game.

, They usually use Zubat/Golbat and Poochyena/Mightyena. Raising Pokémon that are strong against Poison and Dark types can give you an advantage into beating Team Magma and Aqua. This, however, is unnecessary if your team is already full, because utilizing a couple of Psychic/Fighting-Type moves is more efficient than just taking a random Pokémon with a type advantage.

,, Usually, it's best to go with it and have the adventure of the game.

Blow by Winona's Flying gym with a variety of Pokémon.,
Use a strong, balanced team to get by the Psychic team.,
Avoid using fire, ground, or rock Pokémon to crush the final Water Gym.","How to Beat the Gym Leaders in Pokémon Emerald, Ruby or Sapphire2"," The first gym is the easiest to get past and a few Pokémon trained up to level 15 or higher should be enough to beat Roxanne. If you started with a fire-type Pokémon, you may need to train your other Pokémon extra hard.


Rock types are weak to Grass, Water, Ground, Steel and Fighting.
Rock types are strong to Flying, Bug, Fire and Ice, so avoid using these Pokémon when possible., You want Pokémon around level 20, likely 3-4 of them.


Fighting types are weak to Flying and Psychic.
They are strong against Dark, Ice, Steel, Rock and Normal Pokémon .

, Train your Pokémon enough to handle Wattson's level 23 Magneton, and you'll be okay. You need to make sure, however, that you aren't relying on flying or water types, which will be quickly disposed of.


Electric types are weak to Ground (Ground is immune to Electric)
They are strong against Water and Flying.

, Any Water, Ground, or Rock Type move will work well. Fire Pokémon have a variety of weaknesses that are easily covered by common Pokémon, but a water Pokémon is usually your best bet. Your Pokémon should be able to fight against level 26-28 Pokemon.


Fire types are weak to Water, Ground and Rock.
They are strong against Bug, Grass, Ice and Steel.

, Use almost any of your moves for this gym, since they all hit neutrally with very few exceptions. Norman, the gym leader, has three Pokemon, the strongest of which is only level 31.


Normal types are weak to Fighting but immune to Ghost attacks., All of the Pokémon you fight here are around level 30, so make sure your team matches that. With a balanced team, flying Pokémon are a cinch.


Flying types are weak to Electric, Rock and Ice.
They are strong to Bug, Grass and Fighting and immune to Ground., Some of the best Pokémon in the game are Psychic, and they don't have many weaknesses. That said, a solid team above level 40-45 will handle the battle easily.


Psychic types are weak to Dark (doesn't effect), Bug and Ghost.
They are strong against Fighting and Poison.

, By now, you should have a strong, well balanced team that can get through the Water Gym. If you've got a solid electric Pokémon, like Raichu, you can usually get by with very few others. You will be fighting Pokémon from level 40-43.


Water types are weak to Electric and Grass

, In order to obtain the Shiny Charm, an item that increases the odds of finding shinies, you will need to first register every Pokémon in the Alola Pokedex as caught. This does not however include event Pokémon such as Magearna. Trading will be required to register version exclusive Pokémon from the other version.

, Go to the Game Freak office in Heahea City after completing the Alola Pokedex and there, you will be given the shiny charm.

, This is important for this shiny hunting method. Since S.O.S chaining will be used to find a shiny, you'll need a powerful Pokémon with False Swipe to knock Pokémon to 1HP. If the shiny Pokémon you want happens to be a ghost type, the Pokémon with False Swipe will either need the move Odour Sleuth or the ability Scrappy, so it can use False Swipe on those Pokemon.

, Since the main shiny hunting method in Pokémon Sun and Moon can be very time consuming, your Pokémon are going to get attacked a lot, and they're going to run low on PP. To make sure they don't faint or run out of moves, keep healing items stocked in your bag.

, Most of the Pokémon in the game can be S.O.S chained except for legendaries, Ultra Beasts and Pokémon found using island scan so there are a lot of options available for you to choose from.

, As soon as you find the Pokemon, use an Adrenaline Orb. This will make the Pokémon nervous and likely to call for help. Keep the Pokémon on 1HP with False Swipe so it calls for help. Every time a new Pokémon appears, defeat it until the Pokémon that shows up is shiny.

, Once in one of those places, go through the tall grass until you find a Grubbin.

, Net Balls are a good ball to catch it with, since they work best on Bug and Water-type Pokémon. If it's the beginning of the game, all Poké Balls have a 100% catch rate on Route 1 (note that this won't be the case later on in the game).

, Since Grubbin is a Bug-type Pokémon, the best Pokémon to face are Grass, Dark, and Psychic-type Pokémon. Once your Grubbin is level 20, it will evolve into Charjabug.

, Level up your Charjabug there, and it will evolve into Vikavolt. This works at any level except for level 100, so you can have a Vikavolt as low as level 21.

You have a 20% chance of finding it at Route 8, and a 30% chance of finding it at Wela Volcano Park. You'll find it at anywhere from level 16 to level 20.;
, Only female Salandit are able to evolve; male Salandit will not evolve at all. This can be difficult, since Salandit has only a 12.5% of being female. The easiest way to find one is to use a male Pokémon with the ability Cute Charm at the lead of your party. Cute Charm makes it easier to find a Pokémon of the opposite gender. Sylveon is a good Pokémon for this, since most Eevee are male, and Sylveon gets Cute Charm as its regular ability.

You shouldn't need to do more than weaken it slightly and throw a normal Pokéball at it.


If you have a Pokémon that knows false swipe, then simply use that to get the Fomantis to 1 hp, and catch it that way.;
, This can either be done by battling, or eating rare candies, which level your Pokémon up by 1 each time they are eaten. You may have a long way to go, as your Fomantis will need to be level 34.

, In order to get a Lurantis, it must be daytime. Keep in mind that in Pokémon Moon, your in game clock is twelve hours ahead of the time on your 3DS, so that can help you plan accordingly.

Have your Bounsweet gain experience.,
Train your Steenee to level 29.",How to Evolve Bounsweet in Pokémon Sun and Moon," It can be found in Lush Jungle, or in an in-game trade for a Lillipup in Route 5's Pokémon Center. If you're looking in Lush Jungle, you'll have a 40% chance of finding one in the northwest area. It'll be between level 18 and 21. If you're doing the in-game trade, Lillipup can be found on Route 4, Route 5, Route 6, Brooklet Hill, and Paniola Ranch. You have a 30% chance of finding one on Routes 4, 5, and 6, a 20% chance on finding one on Brooklet Hill, and a 40% chance of finding one in Paniola Ranch. You'll find one between level 11 and 17, depending on where you're looking for one. The in-game trade Bounsweet will be at the level your Lillipup is at and nicknamed Bouncee.;
, Once in the northwest area of Lush Jungle, look through the tall grass until you find a Bounsweet. If you're doing the in-game trade, go to one of the areas in the first step and go through the tall grass until you find a Lillipup.

, Nest Balls are a good Poké Ball to catch one with, since they'll be at a fairly low level. If you're doing the in-game trade, go to the Pokémon Center on Route 5 after catching the Lillipup and talk to the boy near the cafe section. Say yes when he offers you his Bounsweet for your Lillipup, find your Lillipup, and select ""Trade"" to do the trade.

, Since Bounsweet is a Grass-type Pokémon, the best Pokémon to face are Water, Rock, and Ground-type Pokémon. Once your Bounsweet is level 18, it will evolve into Steenee.

, Once it reaches level 29, you'll be offered to have it learn Stomp. Have it learn Stomp, and it will then evolve into Tsareena. Don't decline to learn Stomp, since it won't evolve without having learned Stomp.

Have your Cubone gain experience.,
Once Cubone reaches level 28, it will evolve into Marowak.

",How to Evolve Cubone in Pokémon Sun and Moon," It can be found in the bottom area of Wela Volcano Park. You have a 24% chance of finding one at any time of day. It'll be between level 16 and 19.;
, Go through the tall grass until you find a Cubone.

, Nest Balls are a good ball to catch it with, since they work well on low-level Pokémon.

, Cubone caught in Alola will only evolve during the nighttime. In Pokémon Sun, the in-game clock matches your console's clock, while in Pokémon Moon, the in-game clock is 12 hours ahead of your console's clock. So if you have Pokémon Moon, make sure you're playing during the daytime, not the nighttime.

, Since Cubone is a Ground-type Pokémon, the best Pokémon to face are Electric, Ground, Steel, and Rock-type Pokémon.

Identify where the Crabrawler can be found.,
Go to a berry tree in any one of the areas in step 1 and press A on the berries.,
Catch the Crabrawler.,
Go to Mount Lanakila.",How to Evolve Crabrawler in Pokémon Sun and Moon," You'll find it at berry trees on Route 2, Route 3, Route 4, Route 5, Route 8, Route 10, Route 16, Route 17, Secluded Shore, Poni Plains, and three areas of Poni Wilds. Route 10 and Poni Plains give the best chance of finding one. Depending on where you're looking, you'll find one between level 7 and level 57.;
, If a Crabrawler is there, an exclamation mark will appear above the player character's head and you'll go into a Pokémon battle. If you go without finding a Crabrawler in any of the trees, you'll have to wait for the berries to re-appear to find one.

, If it's a low-level Crabrawler, you can use a Nest Ball to make catching it easier.

, Level up Crabrawler there, and it will evolve into Crabominable. This works at any level except for level 100, so you can have a Crabominable as low as level 2 (if you bred a level 1 Crabrawler instead of catching one as described in the previous steps).

Identify where Wimpod can be found.,
Go to one of the areas where Wimpod can be found.,
Go on your Tauros Charge and hold B while running to chase it.,
Catch the Wimpod.",How to Catch Wimpod in Pokémon Sun and Moon," It's found on the beaches of Route 8, Poni Breaker Coast, and Poni Wilds. Depending on where you go to find it, it'll be between level 17 and level 43.;
, It'll be found in areas with a grey-colored ground and a small hole nearby. You'll see it just standing around, until you get close, in which case it'll run away and try to go back to its hole.

, It'll try to run away, but as long as you don't hit any of the rocks in your way, you'll be able to catch it. After catching it, a red exclamation mark will appear above its head and you'll go into battle with it. If you don't catch it, exit and re-enter the area to respawn it. It may not end up respawning, in which case try again until it does.

, Unlike with most wild Pokémon, it's not as simple as weakening it and throwing a Poké Ball. Its ability, Wimp Out, makes it flee the battle if it gets below half health. Your best bet is to throw a Quick Ball at the start of the battle and hope it captures it. If that fails, weaken it a little bit, making sure its health bar is still green, then throw Poké Balls at it. If you're capturing it on Route 8, you can use Nest Balls for an easier capture.

"
Identify where Rockruff can be found.,
Once you find a Rockruff, catch it.,
Have your Rockruff gain experience.,
Once your Rockruff reaches level 25 during the daytime in Pokémon Sun or during the nighttime in Pokémon Moon, it will evolve into either Midday Form Lycanroc (if you're playing Pokémon Sun) or Midnight Form Lycanroc (if you're playing Pokémon Moon).

",How to Evolve Rockruff in Pokémon Sun and Moon," It's found at the outside area of Ten Carat Hill, which is near your player's house. You need Tauros Charge to get there. You have a 20% chance of finding a Rockruff, which will be between level 10 and 13.;
, It shouldn't be too difficult for you to catch.

, Since Rockruff is a Rock-type Pokémon, the best Pokémon to face are Bug, Fire, Ice, and Flying-type Pokémon. For it to evolve, you'll have to train it during the daytime in Pokémon Sun, and during the nighttime in Pokémon Moon. Note that Pokémon Moon's in-game clock is 12 hours ahead of the 3DS' clock, so be sure to keep track of the time if you're playing Pokémon Moon.

,, Be careful not to faint it, or you'll have to search for another one.

, Any ball will do. Your best bet is to use a Nest Ball, since it'll be at a low level.

Rescue Nebby first.,
On Route 3, proceed south until you reach the southernmost patch of grass.,
Use False Swipe or Hold Back to get Bagon to 1 HP.,
Use Ultra Balls to make Bagon easier to catch.,
Wait for Bagon to evolve into Shelgon at level 30.",How to Catch Salamence in Pokémon Sun and Moon1," This is the better method for people who have less patience, but have more time on their hands. To start, you must have beaten the normal type trial and rescued Nebby from Melemele Meadow.
,  The grass should be located on an overhang on the east.  Run around in the grass until you find a bagon.  Bagon has a pretty low encounter rate, so it will take a while to encounter.,  Then paralyze it or put it to sleep to make it easier to catch.,  After you have caught it, put it in your party.  Now you need to train Bagon.

The easiest method to train Bagon would be turning the Exp. Share on and taking on the Pokémon League over and over.

,  When Shelgon reaches level 50, Shelgon will evolve, and you will have yourself your very own Salamence!

To evolve Bagon and Shelgon faster, use rare candies and EXP boost drinks found in Poke Pelago.

Unlock Adrenaline Orbs.,
On Route 3, proceed south until you reach the southernmost patch of grass.,
Use an Adrenaline Orb to make Bagon more likely to call for help.,
Wait for the second Bagon.,
Knock out the Bagon and repeat until it calls a Salamence.,
Catch the Salamence.",How to Catch Salamence in Pokémon Sun and Moon2," For this method, you should have progressed through the game and cleared Akala island to unlock Adrenaline Orbs in the Poké Mart.,  The grass should be located on an overhang on the east.  Run around in the grass until you find a bagon.  Bagon has a pretty low encounter rate, so it will take a while to encounter.,  Then use False Swipe or Hold Back to get Bagon to 1 HP., When Bagon calls for help, it usually will call another Bagon.  ,  It will take a while, as there is a 1% chance of finding a Salamence, but be persistent and you will find one., Since Salamence can sometimes be challenging to catch, try using Ultra Balls once again.

If you knock Salamence down to 1 HP by using false swipe or hold back once again, you will likely be able to catch him with a regular pokéball.

Once you find a Sandygast, catch it.",How to Catch Sandygast in Pokémon Sun and Moon," It can be found on the beach area of Hano Grand Resort. You have a 20% chance of finding one at any time of the day. You'll find one between level 21 and level 24.;
, It's located to the east of Heahea City on Akala Island. Use the Charizard Glide to get there faster, if you're not already there.

, Go into the sand clouds to encounter a Pokémon, which will be either Staryu or Sandygast. If you use up all the sand clouds without finding a Sandygast, exit and re-enter the area to respawn the sand clouds.

, Since it'll be fairly low level, you can use a Nest Ball for an easier catch. If it's nighttime, you can also use a Dusk Ball.

Receive the Lapras ride pager and the fishing rod from Lana.,
Head to the professor's house on Route 1.,
Head to the ocean on the right with Lapras and surf to the Melemele Sea.,
Repeat going back and forth in between Route 1 and the Melemele Sea to find a rippling spot until one of the Pokémon you encounter this way is called Corsola.,
Attack, and knock out everything Corsola calls for help that isn't Mareanie.,
Catching Mareanie is simple.",How to Catch Mareanie in Pokémon Sun and Moon," At the start of the second trial in the game on Akala Island, you will receive the way to surf in this game from Lana, the trial captain. You cannot access it until this point. You have to complete the trial to get the fishing rod, so this cannot be done until the trail is complete.;
, At this point in the game you will have already been there once, but if you don't remember, it's right below your house on Route 1.

, Go back and forth until a fishing spot (a small collection of rocks under the water) is bubbling/rippling and then press A to fish. Be sure to approach the rippling fishing spot slowly, or else it will stop rippling. Press A again whenever the line starts shaking.

, Lower Corsola's health until it's red. Be careful though, if you knock it out, you have to repeat the previous steps. Lowering Corsola's health into red will cause it to call for help. If Corsola uses a healing move instead, keep the health low.

, There is only a 20% chance it will spawn a Mareanie, so be patient. Eventually if you keep Corsola A's health low and attack and knock out all the Corsola it summons, you will get a Mareanie.

, Get it down to low health and throw either a Great, Ultra, or Net Ball at it for best chance. If it's night, also try Dusk Balls. You don't have to worry about finishing off Corsola the turn after Mareanie appears as Mareanie will attack it for you. Use that turn to lower its health. After it's in the red, throw your ball of choice.

Know where Mimikyu can be found.,
Beat the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart trial if you haven't already.,
Walk around the Megamart for awhile until you encounter a Mimikyu.,
Lower the HP of the Mimikyu to at least half before you try to catch it.,
Enjoy your Mimikyu.",How to Catch Mimikyu in Pokémon Sun and Moon," There is only one known place where Mimikyu can be found, and that's the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart, the site of Acerola's ghost trial, on Ula'ula Island. Mimikyu has a pretty low encounter and capture rate of 5 percent and 45 percent respectively, so be prepared beforehand, with a lot of patience, and make sure that you have a lot of pokéballs on hand.;
, This step is vital, because you cannot catch any Pokémon in the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart until you have beaten the trial completely.

, As stated above, Mimikyu has a pretty low encounter rate of 5 percent, so be prepared to run into a lot of Haunters and Gengars before you run into one Mimikyu.


There is no grass in the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart, but just walk around and you will get encounters with wild Pokémon as you go.

, Once it is at half, use Pokéballs such as Great Balls or Ultra Balls. If it is nighttime in your game, then use a Dusk Ball, because Dusk Balls are more effective for catching Pokémon when it is nighttime in your game. If you want to get the battle over with, you could also attempt to throw a Quick Ball once the battle first starts.

, Give it a nickname and/or add it to your party, if you wish to.

Look out for a patch of grass.,
Boost your chances if you can.",How to Catch Jangmo‐o in Pokémon Sun and Moon2," Once you are almost done with Poni Canyon, you will see a small patch of grass near the trial site.


In this patch, you have a 5% chance to find a Jangmo-o.

, Your chances can be boosted by having a Pokémon with the move Sweet Scent in your party, or an ability that increases encounters with wild Pokémon.

Go to the Steelix-shaped house located in Seafolk Village.,
Proceed to the balcony, where there will be a fisherman and a fishing spot.,
Be patient as you try to find it.,
Be prepared for some failure to catch it.,
Keep trying until you catch Dhelmise.",How to Catch Dhelmise in Pokémon Sun and Moon," Walk to the very end of the house, then go through the door to the outside.;
, The fisherman is not very important, but the fishing spot is, as it is the only place you can catch Dhelmise in the entire game! You will need the fishing rod from Lana in order to try and catch it.

, Dhelmise is a very rare find. There is only a 1% chance to catch it when the water is still, and a 10% chance when the spot is bubbling, so be patient!


A secret tip to maximize your chances of acquiring this elusive Pokémon is the door you went through. If you don't know, going through a door will reset the bubbling at the spot, so if you aren't lucky the first time you can keep going in and out of the house until you catch one.

, It has a low catch rate. You have a 3.3% chance to catch it with a normal Pokéball at full HP, and it has a catch rate of 25. For comparison, the catch rate for most Pokémon on the first route of the game is 255, meaning you'll need both luck and a lot of special Pokéballs!

, While it might be difficult, with enough patience and persistence you can have your very own Dhelmise to fight and train.

"
"
Proceed to the point in the game where you have passed the water type trial on Akala Island.,
Go to the far right of the wood bridge near the entrance to Brooklet Hill.,
If the fishing spot is rippling, continue with the method.,
Fish in this spot.,
Repeat this process until Feebas is found.",How to Catch Feebas in Pokémon Sun and Moon," You need Lapras and the fishing rod from Lana for this.;
,  From here, you should look directly south and get on Lapras.  You should see a fishing spot.

,  If it is not, leave Brooklet Hill and return.  Keep in mind that going too fast near the fishing spot or traveling on top of the fishing spot will cause it not to ripple.

,  When it is rippling, there is a 5% chance of finding a Feebas.  When it is not rippling, there is a 1% chance.  It is very easy to leave Brooklet Hill and come back from this spot.

,  From here, you should weaken it with False Swipe or Hold Back, and then paralyze it or put it to sleep.


If it is night, you can use a dusk ball, but a dive ball will work well any time.  Feebas has a relatively high catch rate, so it should be easy to catch.

Once you think you're ready, challenge the Totem Pokémon.",How to Beat the Totem Pokémon in Pokémon Sun and Moon," A Totem Pokémon is a larger-than-normal Pokémon that has boosted stats and can call ally Pokémon into battle to help them. You'll know them by the aura that surrounds them during the battle. Totem Pokémon and their allies cannot be caught.;
, They are as follows:


Totem Gumshoos/Totem Alolan Raticate (You face Gumshoos in Sun and Raticate in Moon)
Totem Wishiwashi (in its School form)
Totem Salazzle
Totem Lurantis
Totem Vikavolt
Totem Mimikyu
Totem Kommo-o

, Totem Pokémon will have powerful movesets and ally Pokémon that have movesets which help the Totem Pokémon. For example, Totem Lurantis has Trumbeak and Castform as its allies. Trumbeak has Rock Blast to cover Lurantis' weaknesses, while Castform has Sunny Day so that Lurantis' Solar Blade doesn't have to take a turn to charge (Lurantis also has a Power Herb which causes Solar Blade to skip the recharge turn even without Sunny Day), and its Synthesis heals more of its health.

,


Totem Gumshoos and Totem Raticate are both weak to Fighting, while Raticate is also weak to Bug and Fairy.
Totem Wishiwashi is weak to Electric and Grass.
Totem Salazzle is weak to Water, Ground, Rock, and Psychic.
Totem Lurantis is weak to Fire, Ice, Flying, Bug, and Poison.
Totem Vikavolt is weak to Fire and Rock.
Totem Mimikyu is weak to Ghost and Steel.
Totem Kommo-o is weak to Dragon, Fairy, Ice, Psychic, and Flying.

, You don't want to go into a Totem Pokémon battle with half or more of your team being weak to the Totem Pokémon's attacks.

, If you go into a Totem Pokémon battle underleveled, you have a higher chance of losing the battle. Their increased stats mean they can easily sweep even a six Pokémon team.

, As simple as it may sound, super effective moves can mean the difference between winning and losing. Don't be afraid to use status moves, either. Even a simple paralysis can make a battle much easier.

, Unless you're doing a no items in battle rule for your run, you'll want Potions and Revives handy.

, They'll be much different than the gym battles of years past, but if you're prepared, you should be able to beat them.

Have a good team of Pokémon.,
Train your Pokémon.,
Buy a supply of healing items and Revives.,
Go to Mount Lanakila.,
Go up to the guards, who will tell you that you can't leave after going inside the Pokémon League, then ask you if you accept that.,
Know about the Elite Four.,
Defeat Hala.,
Defeat Olivia.,
Defeat Acerola.,
Defeat Kahili.,
After you defeat your fourth Elite Four member, a teleporter will appear in the middle of the main Elite Four room.,
Defeat Professor Kukui.,
Enjoy the credits!",How to Beat the Elite Four in Pokémon Sun and Moon," Preferably, you'll want a team of six Pokémon that all have different types, without overlapping any types. Unless you're doing a challenge run with unevolved Pokémon, they should all be fully evolved (though there are some Pokémon that don't have a pre-evolution or evolution). You should also pay attention to their movesets - for example, a Primarina with a moveset of Sparkling Aria, Ice Beam, Moonblast, and Psychic would be better than having a moveset with more than one Water and/or Fairy-type move. Held items can also help you - for example, having a Primarina hold Primarina Z will allow you to transform its Sparkling Aria into Oceanic Operetta, a super-powerful move that can deal a ton of damage!;
, Your Pokémon should be at least level 55 before taking on the Elite Four for the first time. To make training faster, have the Exp. Share on, so that all your Pokémon gain experience in a battle. You should also play with your Pokémon in Pokémon Refresh, so that they'll gain boosted experience in battles.

, You'll want to buy Hyper Potions, Max Potions, Full Restores, and Revives. Keep in mind, Hyper Potions heal 120 HP, rather than the 200 HP it healed in previous Pokémon games. This will end up being expensive, so spend your money wisely. If you have any items that you can sell, such as Nuggets and Star Pieces, sell them, so that you'll have more money to spend.

, From the Pokémon Center, go left, then up to reach the Pokémon League. It's a fairly long stretch, so you may want to consider using the Tauros Charge to reach it faster. The first time you go to Mount Lanakila, you'll be challenged by Hau, who has a team of Alola form Raichu, Jolteon/Flareon/Vaporeon (which one he uses depends on the starter you chose), Komala, and the fully evolved form of the starter whose type is weak to the one you chose (Incineroar, Primarina, or Decidueye). Beat him if you haven't already done so.

, Say yes, and the door to the Pokémon League will open. Go inside.

, The four Elite Four members you'll be facing are Hala, Olivia, Acerola, and Kahili. The next four steps will detail them in that order, but you can choose the order you face them in.

, He uses Fighting-type Pokémon. He has a level 54 Hariyama, level 54 Primeape, level 54 Bewear, level 54 Poliwrath, and level 55 Crabominable. Fighting types are weak to Fairy, Psychic, and Flying type moves. In addition, Bewear is weak to Fighting type moves, Poliwrath is weak to Electric and Grass type moves, and Crabominable is weak to Fire, Fighting, and Steel type moves.


Bewear has the Fluffy ability, which halves the damage of moves that make contact, but doubles the damage it takes from Fighting type moves. Your best bet is to use special moves, Fire moves, or moves that don't make contact.
Hariyama's Knock Off will do some serious damage if it uses it against a Pokémon with a held item, so beware.
Crabominable has the Fightinium Z, so it can use its Z-Move, All-Out Pummeling.

, She uses Rock-type Pokémon. She has a level 54 Relicanth, level 54 Carbink, level 54 Alola form Golem, level 54 Probopass, and level 55 Midnight form Lycanroc. Rock types are weak to Water (Relicanth's part-Water typing negates this), Fighting (Carbink's part-Fairy typing negates this), Grass (Probopass' part-Steel typing negates this), and Ground. In addition, Relicanth is weak to Electric type moves, and Carbink is weak to Steel type moves.


Both Golem and Probopass have the Sturdy ability, so you can't defeat them in one hit.
Lycanroc has the Rockium Z, so it can use its Z-Move, Continental Crush.

, She uses Ghost-type Pokémon. She has a level 54 Sableye, level 54 Drifblim, level 54 Dhelmise, level 54 Froslass, and level 55 Palossand. Ghost types are weak to Ghost (Sableye's part-Dark typing negates this) and Dark (Sableye's part-Dark typing negates this as well). In addition, Sableye is weak to Fairy moves (its only weakness), Drifblim is weak to Electric, Rock, and Ice type moves, Dhelmise is weak to Fire, Flying, and Ice type moves, Froslass is weak to Fire, Rock, and Steel type moves, and Palossand is weak to Water, Grass, and Ice type moves.


Try not to let Drifblim set up Amnesia, since it can use Baton Pass to pass the boosts to another Pokémon in her party.
Sableye and Froslass have Confuse Ray, which can cause you problems if you're unlucky with your Pokémon hitting themselves in confusion.
Palossand has the Ghostium Z, so it can use its Z-Move, Never-Ending Nightmare.

, She uses Flying-type Pokémon. She has a level 54 Skarmory, level 54 Crobat, level 54 Baile Style (Fire/Flying-type) Oricorio, level 54 Mandibuzz, and level 55 Toucannon. Flying types are weak to Rock (Skarmory's part-Steel typing negates this weakness), Ice (Skarmory's part-Steel typing and Oricorio's part-Fire typing negate this weakness), and Electric type moves. In addition, Skarmory is weak to Fire type moves, Crobat is weak to Psychic type moves, and Oricorio is weak to Water type moves.


Skarmory has the Sturdy ability, so you can't defeat it in one hit. It also uses Spikes, so that your Pokémon take damage every time you switch them.
Crobat and Oricorio can confuse your Pokémon, which can cause you problems if you're unlucky with your Pokémon hitting themselves in confusion.
Don't use a move that makes contact while Toucannon's using Beak Blast; otherwise, it will cause your Pokémon to be burned.
Toucannon has the Flyinium Z, so it can use its Z-Move, Supersonic Skystrike.

, Go into it, then go up and sit in the chair. You'll get a cutscene with Professor Kukui, who tells you that you have to defeat him to become champion, then challenges you.

, Unlike the Elite Four, he doesn't specialize in one type. He uses a level 57 Midday form Lycanroc, level 56 Alola form Ninetales, level 56 Braviary, level 56 Magnezone, level 56 Snorlax, and level 58 fully evolved form of the starter that the starter you picked is weak against.


Lycanroc is Rock-type, so use a Water, Grass, Ground, or Fighting-type attack. Beware of Stealth Rock, which hurts your Pokémon when you switch them in (doing low damage to Pokémon that resist Rock type attacks, normal damage against Pokémon that have no weakness or resistance to Rock type attacks, double damage to Pokémon with a single weakness to Rock type attacks, and quadruple damage to dual type Pokémon whose types are both weak to Rock type attacks).
Alola form Ninetales is Ice/Fairy-type, so use a Steel, Fire, Poison, or Rock type attack. Steel is especially good, since Ninetales takes quadruple the normal damage from it.
Braviary is Normal/Flying-type, so use an Ice, Rock, or Electric type attack. Note that it has Tailwind, which doubles the speed of his entire team for 3 turns.
Magnezone is Electric/Steel-type, so use a Fire, Fighting, or Ground type attack. Ground is especially good, since Magnezone takes quadruple the normal damage from it. It has the Sturdy ability, so you can't defeat it in one hit.
Snorlax is Normal-type, so use a Fighting type attack.
Incineroar is Fire/Dark-type, so use a Water, Ground, Fighting, or Rock type attack. It has the Firium Z, so it can use its Z-Move, Inferno Overdrive.
Primarina is Water/Fairy-type, so use a Grass, Electric, or Poison type attack. It has the Waterium Z, so it can use its Z-Move, Hydro Vortex.
Decidueye is Grass/Ghost-type, so use a Fire, Flying, Ice, Ghost, or Dark type move. It has the Grassium Z, so it can use its Z-Move, Bloom Doom.

, You'll be seeing a long cutscene, so make sure your console is charged (don't let it die on you, or you'll have to do at least the Professor Kukui battle again). During this cutscene, you'll be able to catch Tapu Koko. Don't worry if you accidentally faint it - after the credits, you can go back to catch it again at any time.

Put on the goggles and gloves (non-optional!).,
Make sure the area is well ventilated before mixing.,
Use a non-metallic basin.,
Gently pour one part hydrochloric acid into every two parts hydrogen peroxide (add acid to water).,Make enough of the solution to completely submerge the circuit board.,
Gently put in the circuit board and agitate it for about ten to fifteen minutes.,
Continue stirring until all copper has dissolved, and the solution has taken on a slight green tinge.

,
For cleanup, make sure you are wearing gloves.,
Mix a one to one ratio of acetone and rubbing alcohol.,
The etching solution is toxic to fish and other water organisms.",How to Etch a Circuit Board," Always remember safety first. You can easily blind yourself!;
, The chemicals will produce hazardous fumes. You can lose your sense of smell!

, Check if it can withstand the acid using a few drops.

, When mixed, they form a substance that is a severe skin irritant, and will produce toxic chlorine gas.,, The solution will get warmer and fume more. Don't put your face over it!,, Wash the board off in cold water to remove any etching solution. Then use a paper towel or rag to dry it off completely. Set it aside. Assure that there is no solution in the workspace or containers then remove the gloves and goggles.

, Take a paper towel, dip it into the solution, and gently rub it over the surface of the board. The permanent marker will begin to come off. Continue rubbing until all the marker is gone. You should see that your circuit is now inscribed in the copper.

, Don't pour it in the sink when you are done. It is illegal to do so and might damage your pipes.


You can reuse the solution by adding a bit of Hydrogen Peroxide right before the next etch and a bit of acid when the solutions stops working (every 4 or 5 etches). Store the solution in a completely new and different container and not pour it back into the hydrogen peroxide or HCL container.
If you have to dispose of it label it and give it to chemical waste facility.
You can also fell out the copper (video) and then safely pour the remaining liquid in the sink.

Clean Up your Desktop: Cleaning up your desktop is like cleaning up your room because of two reasons: One; even though you hate doing it, looking at the end results can alone pull a heavy weight off your shoulders, and two; doing so makes it much easier to sort through your belongings.,
Run Disk Cleanup: This is a useful program that comes with Windows computers.,
Defragment your Computer: Defragmenting is a term for organizing files into an orderly fashion and, while it may not sound like a very efficient way to maintain your computer, it's actually one of the best ways ever.,
Scan your computer for viruses and malware: Viruses can be dangerous to computers, and malware will slow it down a lot.,
Optimize Start-up Programs: So, you start up your computer.,
Uninstall some programs: We all use programs on our computers, but after years and years of using it, we cram it with some useless programs.",How to Extend Your Computer's Life," Plus, it makes the computer start up quicker by having fewer icons to load up.


To clean up your desktop, first start the Desktop Cleanup Wizard by right-clicking the desktop, go to ""Sort By..."" and click ""Run Desktop Cleanup Wizard"" Click Next and select the icons you want to clean up. This will not delete the icons, but instead put them into a folder where you do not have to see them for now. Click Next and then Finish.
The Desktop Cleanup Wizard will only move shortcut icons, so the remaining files are for you to delete/move. Remember to organize it to where it makes files easy to find and open.;
, It deletes any unneeded files safely.






To open it, go to Start and My Computer. Right-click your disk drive and click Properties. Click Tools and click Disk Cleanup. This will start up the Disk Cleanup process. Wait for the program to analyze your free space. When it is done, simply click OK. It may take a while, but the results are great.

, It does take a while, though.


To do so, follow the same steps as Step 2 except, when you click on Tools, click Disk Defragment. This will launch the Disk Defragment program. Simply click the Defragment button and watch it go! It will take a few hours depending on your hard drive size however, so be patient.

, Of course, your computer's security is more important than how fast it is, so doing this may save you from a possible data loss .






To scan for viruses, you will need a virus scanner. A good one is Bit Defender Free version. For malware, a good one is Malware Bytes Anti-malware. To scan with these, simply start it up, select Full Scan, and click Start. Again, these scans take a while, so go grab a drink or two while you wait for it to finish.

, First comes iTunes, then Google Desktop, then MSN... See a pattern here? These programs are most likely not needed to start immediately after your computer starts up. This can cause the effect that makes your computer seem to take forever to simply load your desktop. Disabling some of these can help speed up the boot process, so there's no need to go grab a coffee while your computer starts up.


To do this, click Start, Run, and type this: msconfig. A rather lengthy-looking box will pop up. Don't get scared; there's only one thing you need to change. Click the ""Startup"" tab and a list of every program that starts up when you turn on your computer. Shocked? Uncheck all of the programs you don't need to start up. When you're done, click OK and click Exit without Restart.

, Uninstalling programs can free up your storage on your computer and speed it up.


To uninstall some programs, go to Start and open Control Panel. Under ""Programs"" category, click ""Uninstall a program"". Now, uninstall any program that you don't need, never used, or rarely used.

Computer security not only protects the privacy of your patients or clients, it also protects you from legal liability if that information is stolen or released from your organization.Antivirus programs ensure your data is protected from being corrupted or destroyed by computer viruses or malware.If your computers came with antivirus programs pre-installed, make sure they are updated regularly. You also should make sure that any network you've created for your offices has sufficient security and antivirus protection.
If you've ever been the victim of a computer virus, you know how they can destroy files and corrupt data in your system. If the affected files and data contained private medical data protected by HIPAA, you would be in violation of the law.;
, Saving all data to an off-site location ensures the data is secure and protected in the event of hard drive or server failure.HIPAA covers all health information in any form that personally identifies the patient. The HIPAA security guidelines ensure patient health information doesn't fall into the wrong hands, and isn't accidentally altered or destroyed.Backing up your data at an off-site location ensures that private medical information will be protected from loss or corruption if a disaster such as a flood or fire occurs in the office.Back-ups also ensure that any files or data accidentally deleted can be recovered.Consider also creating a contingency plan to recover data in the event of an emergency or accidental deletion. Any such plan should be written down so it can easily be implemented if necessary., All machines with private medical information on them must be password-protected and kept in secure locations.For example, you shouldn't put a computer in a hallway or high-traffic area where anyone other than staff would have access to it.
Computers should time out after a brief period of inactivity, and passwords must be kept secure. Staff should memorize computer passwords rather than having them posted on or nearby the computer itself.Make sure employees don't leave documents that contain patient's private medical data in scanners, printers, or fax machines.Your computer system should have an audit trail feature in place, so that you can pull up the history of a particular file and have a record of every employee who accessed the file, when they accessed it, and what changes were made., If you get new computers or other equipment, you must make sure that it has the same levels of protection in place.


You also should make sure any new equipment or machines you put into service have sufficient security features themselves.
Keep in mind that a machine may have appropriate security but not be compatible with your current system. Likewise, new equipment that's compatible with your existing system may require upgrades to ensure data is secure., Using encryption on emails and mobile devices can help keep patient's medical data from being accidentally disclosed.


HIPAA doesn't prohibit the use of email or mobile devices to transmit patient information, nor does it specifically require that emails be encrypted. However, encryption can be put in place fairly easily and is a cost-effective method to ensure the data is secure.Even if you don't encrypt your emails, you must have a policy in place on how private patient information is handled in emails and mobile devices.To determine whether you should use encryption to comply with HIPAA, you must conduct a risk assessment to analyze whether private patient information is at risk of being accessed by unauthorized users. If the risk is relatively high, then you generally should use encryption.In most cases, it's better to err on the side of caution and encrypt electronic data, even though it's not specifically required by HIPAA.If you allow patients to request or access their medical information using email or a mobile app, include a disclosure statement and make sure they understand the risks involved in accessing their information that way.If your organization allows storage of private medical information on mobile devices, you should have policies to protect that information and regulate the removal of those devices from your office.Patient contact information also must be kept secure, including any mailing lists or other programs that could connect names or email addresses to particular medications or types of treatment., If you have contractors or tech companies that service or maintain your systems, you must make sure that they understand the security required by HIPAA.


Keep a list of all the hardware, software, and network components such as routers that your organization uses. Make sure all of them have adequate security in place, such as encryption or firewalls, when they are installed.You also should make sure that any tech vendors with whom you contract understand HIPAA requirements and are willing to work with you to ensure each of the separate components of your computer systems are coordinated to meet the security standards., To best ensure HIPAA compliance, make sure your policies are universally applicable to everyone in your organization who handles or has access to patient medical data.HIPAA requires written policies that include mandatory employee training and sanctions for policy violations.All policies and procedures should be thoroughly documented in writing and generally available to all employees.Any agreements you have with other business associates that may handle medical data also must reflect a commitment to HIPAA compliance. If you have any existing agreements executed before the law went into effect, make sure they're updated so that the continuing relationship reflects HIPAA requirements.Keep in mind that there's no one-size-fits-all policy mandated by HIPAA. Rather, you must create policies and procedures that address your organization's particular privacy and security needs., Your officers should fully understand and be up-to-date on all aspects of HIPAA.


HIPAA security standards require that you appoint at least one person to work as your security manager. This person not only needs an understanding of the legal requirements, but also of your particular organization's systems and how they work together., Each patient generally should sign a written document acknowledging receipt of your organization's policies.Your written notice must explain to patients their rights regarding their health information and tell them how their health information will be used or shared.In addition to giving patients their own copy of the notice, make sure you have the notice posted in a prominent place in your office so anyone can refer to it as needed.Patients are not required by law to sign the form, but if a patient refuses to sign you must make a record indicating that you didn't get his or her signature.If you need to share a patient's private medical information for some reason other than treatment or bill payment, you must first obtain the patient's authorization., If an employee does not follow your organization's policies or procedures, he or she should be disciplined accordingly and the violation logged.


Keep in mind that if you don't document something, you won't be able to prove it happened later. If a breach in protocol or gap in security is revealed, you must thoroughly document how the problem was found and what steps were taken to eliminate or alleviate the risk.If there is a breach in security, you also must notify any patients' whose information was involved.If the breach affects more than 500 patients, you also must notify major media outlets in the state or region where those people live., Each employee should have his or her own copy of the policy for reference.HIPAA requires a written policy, and this must be shared with all employees who have access to private medical information.You should review and update your policies regularly to conform with HHS regulations or opinions.All employees must be trained and quizzed on the policy and on HIPAA requirements before they begin working with private medical information.Keep in mind that other individuals who may have access to private medical information, including volunteers or interns, also must have training regarding HIPAA requirements, even if you don't pay them or consider them employees., Continuing education ensures your employees don't forget correct procedures.


HIPAA is enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). You can request an OCR speaker to discuss health information privacy with your staff by filling out the form on the HHS website.Document your training efforts so you can demonstrate to HHS that the training is in place and employees who deal with private patient information understand HIPAA's requirements., If your policies change, you should make sure your employees are educated on additional requirements or new procedures.


Staff should be regularly tested to ensure that they understand HIPAA's privacy and security standards. Keep the scored tests in each employee's personnel file so copies are available for your OCR auditor., Employees should understand the consequences of violations, and discipline should be applied consistently and universally.


Employees who violate your privacy policies should be sanctioned, and there should be no exceptions to your procedures. Making an exception creates a gray area regarding how secure patient data is kept, and won't be tolerated by HHS., Use a company not connected with your organization to conduct your risk assessments.The firm must be familiar with HIPAA requirements and run tests using federal HIPAA standards and guidelines.Since you will be subject to regular audits from the OCR, you must keep records of the company with which you contract and the results of the risk assessment for review by the auditor., You should have the company run risk assessments at least once a year to ensure your systems are in compliance.Risk assessments are especially important if you are using computer systems that were installed before HIPAA took effect. Newer systems are more likely to be in compliance than existing systems that weren't required to secure data in any particular way.The risk assessment should compare your computer systems to the type of system required by HIPAA, and identify any gaps not covered by your system that the law requires.Even if your organization has a high level of compliance, the best risk assessment companies still will uncover areas where your system can be improved., If security risks are uncovered by the assessment, take the steps necessary to remedy the problem.


When revisions are made to HIPAA, or new regulations are issued by HHS, you should review your systems and determine what changes need to be made to make sure you remain in compliance.If a breach in your security protocol has occurred, you should investigate it immediately and document the results of that investigation. Depending on the type of breach that occurred, it may be necessary to notify affected patients or to notify HHS or other authorities., Some risks uncovered in your risk assessment may require developing new procedures to best secure patient's medical data.


If changes are necessary to ensure HIPAA compliance, make sure you communicate with employees who will be affected by the change and make sure they're on board.Communication within particular departments is essential, especially since employees who work within the system on a regular basis may have better ideas for how to implement the change more efficiently."

Do a mini detox.",How to Do a Digital Detox," Deciding to do a digital detox can be a big decision. You may worry about what you’ll miss by logging out. You might even wonder what you’ll do with your time. You can do a digital detox if you remind yourself of all the good reasons why you should take this time to log off and unplug.Make a list of three to five things you want to try to get done during your detox time.
For instance, you might write that you want to work in your garden, organize your closets, or catch up with old friends.
Remind yourself of the benefits of the detox. For example, tell yourself, “I’ll feel more relaxed, in tune with myself, and in tune with my family and friends.”
Tell yourself that the detox will give you a break from some of the information-overload you may be feeling.;
, Although you may want to start your digital detox right now, you should think about the timing of your detox first. Deciding to log off during a peak work time or around exam time during school may not be best decision. Choose a time when you have fewer responsibilities and when there will be less consequences for missing a message or two.Think about having your detox over a weekend, school break, or holiday. You are less likely to receive important messages during those times.
Look at your calendar and pick a time when you don’t have any upcoming deadlines or important events. This way you won’t miss updates about them.

, You may not realize all the ways in which you depend on your smartphone and other devices in your day-to-day life. For instance, if you use your phone as an alarm, do you have an alarm clock you can use while you detox? If you want to listen to music during the detox, do you have a radio? If you use your phone or computer for driving directions, do you have maps so you won't get lost? Before your detox, try to note all the different ways in which you rely on your devices and think of other ways to meet your needs.

You may also need to think about how you will do this if your family is not participating in the detox. What will you do if everyone is watching TV? Do you have a digital-free area where you can retreat to read or work on a craft project? How will you fill your time and avoid the temptation when other people are using their devices?

, In general a digital detox will last for about one to two days.This gives you time to connect with your friends and family and do some of the things you’ve been meaning to do. But, if you have a lot of obligations, this might be too long for you. Deciding how long to detox will help you plan for it and anticipate any issues that may come up during your detox time.


Consider your responsibilities and obligations. How long can you digitally detox without getting behind in your work?
Think about people that depend on you. Ask yourself if there is anything you would need to do online for them during this time.

, If you are including work or school in your digital detox, you may need to let others know what you are doing.This way they can let you know what’s going on and you won’t miss messages about major deadlines or other important information.


Do you have a landline so that someone can call and reach you in case of an emergency? You might also want to let family members know that it's okay to show up unannounced if there is an emergency.
Ask someone to contact you with important messages if your digital detox is going to last more than 12 hours. For instance, say something like, “Could you call me on my landline if we have a schedule update at work?”
If you primarily communicate with people via text, email, or messaging, you may want to let them know what’s going on.

, Nothing can ruin a digital detox or any peaceful time like an electronic device that’s beeping, binging, and chirping every two minutes. Staying logged in will make it easy for you to quickly turn on your device, especially if you have widgets, and check your social networking updates. Logging out and turning off all notifications for social media can help you stick with your detox.


You don’t need to disable your account, but you can log out of the app on your device. You can log back in once your digital detox is over.
Make sure you know your login information before you log out of the app.
Turn off your alerts and notifications if you can’t or don’t want to log out of your apps.

, When your device is right by your side you may be tempted to check it to make sure you aren’t missing anything. Keeping your phone, tablet, or laptop at a distance will make it easier for you to do a digital detox.Remember the adage “out of sight, out of mind.” Put your device in a closet, drawer, or somewhere out of sight.
If you need to, ask a family member or close friend to keep your device for you during your digital detox.

, One great way to make the most of your digital detox is to spend some of your time doing something to help someone else. It doesn’t have to be a big thing like repainting their house, but you can take an hour or two to do something that benefits someone else.


Volunteer for a cause or organization that you support or attend a charitable event in your neighborhood.
Offer to go grocery shopping for your dad, walk your neighbor’s dog, or help your friend wash her car.

, During a digital detox is a great time to practice relaxation techniques and calming strategies.When your detox is over, these strategies will help you release stress and tension when you begin to feel digital overload or stress in general.


Try spending just five to 10 minutes meditating. Get comfortable and try to focus on your breathing. If you find your thoughts drifting, gently bring them back to your breathing.
Practice deep breathing techniques. Slowly inhale into your belly, hold it, and then slowly exhale. Repeat these steps for a few breaths.

, One of the challenges of doing a digital detox is boredom. You may be so used to being online that you don’t know what to do with your time. You can use your time during your digital detox to try a new activity or learn a new skill.Read a book or article about a topic that interests you. You can even go to the library to look at a hard copy instead of a digital one.
Take a class or lesson to learn a new skill or talent. For instance, take a gymnastics class or sign up for foreign language lessons.

, It can be easy to let social networking and messaging take the place of face-to-face or even phone interaction. You can make the most of your digital detox by spending at least some of your time with your family and friends.You can use this time to catch up, talk, or just hang out.


Give them your undivided attention when you’re together. You don’t have your electronic device distracting you, so look them in the eyes and show them you’re listening.
Invite them somewhere or accept their invitations to go out. Catch a movie, grab some coffee, or play some basketball.

, Ease yourself back into the digital world. This way you won’t become overwhelmed by the information and entertainment. It will also give you the opportunity to think about which social networks, apps, and games and actually want and need to use.Start by logging back into your primary email account. Prioritize your messages and respond to those you need to.
Delete any messages that aren’t important and take a few minutes to unsubscribe to any newsletters or updates you don’t really need.

, After your detox, try setting limits for your digital time. This way you can avoid getting caught up in the never-ending cycle of emails, alerts, updates, and posts.Try checking and responding to emails only in the morning (between the hours of 9 and 10am, for instance) and at the end of the day (from 4:30 to 5pm).
Turn your notifications off on social media apps and sites. This way you won’t be tempted to check every time your electronic device beeps.
Limit the time you spend on social networking sites. For example, you might set a limit of 15 minutes for being on Twitter or Snapchat.

, You will get the most benefit out of your digital detox if you make it something that you do more than once.You don’t have to do a full detox for a day or more, though. Doing a mini detox, even for just an hour or two, might help you briefly recharge and relax.


Consider the hour before bed as a non-digital time. Put your electronic devices on vibrate and turn any non-essential alerts off.
Have a regular weekend detox for a few hours. For example, you might want to spend every Sunday morning free of your electronics.

var coordinates = , , , ];
var polygon_feature = new ol.Feature({

This road runs alongside the Zancudo River.It is recommended that you be well equipped before entering the military base. Purchasing extra armor and ammo is a must.
Using a fast vehicle when entering the base is a great way to quickly find a tank and avoid enemy fire.;
, Having a fast car comes in handy when looking for a tank. You don’t want to waste any time when you are in the base. You will have to avoid enemy fire and vehicles.

, Before the enemy tank has time to react, you must drive up as close as you can to it and then hijack it. If you give the tank too much time, it will be able to fire a shot at you.


Use buildings and other structures to avoid tank fire. The tank shells cannot shoot through these obstacles, and they offer fantastic defense.

, There are bound to be other enemy tanks nearby, so getting out of the base and away from them as quickly as possible will ensure your tank stays alive. The most direct way to exit the base is to go the same way you used to enter it.

Drive to the Richman area of Los Santos.,
Chase the thief and kill him or knock him off of the bike.,
Take the sports bike back to the owner or keep it for yourself.",How to Take the Sport Bike from the Thief in GTA V," The thief will take the sports bike at 1003 Richman Street. If the random event has been triggered, you will see a dot on your radar that flashes blue and red. This indicates the decision you can make: help the victim or take the bike for yourself.


Since this event requires you to chase the thief, it is a good idea to take a fast vehicle.
This objective can be made easier by taking a car, such as a Comet or Infernus, instead of a motorcycle, since slamming into him with a car will eject him from the bike.;
, If you want to kill him, you can shoot him off of the bike with an SMG or Pistol. Otherwise, knock him off of the bike by driving into him.Once he is dead or away from the sports bike, exit your vehicle and get onto the bike.

, The random event can be completed either way. If you want to keep it, drive away from the owner. If you return the bike to the owner, you will not be rewarded.


To repeat this event, take the sports bike from the thief, then go back to the owner and shoot him or shoot near him to scare him.This will make the random event incomplete, and you can keep the bike. Returning to this location will trigger the event again, but you will have to wait several hours in-game for it to become available again.
If you decide to return the Pegassi Bati 801, you can still obtain it by purchasing it for $10,000 on the Southern San Andreas Super Autos website. The website can be accessed via any in-game computer or phone.

, Something like a very rough draft, which I would follow when designing the case.

, These joints adjust for the kerf created by the laser. This joint is 0.2"" long and .125"" wide. The holes on the corners have a radius of 0.02"" and the spacers in the middle are offset 0.01"" along the length and 1/16"" from the corners. This ensures the joints will fit tightly when put together.

, This piece of plywood is where you will mount your motherboard, power supply, and wood stubs for mounting hard drives.

, In this instance, you want the hard drives to be accessed from the back, so build sleds to screw the hard drives onto. Those sleds would be mounted onto wood stubs that connected to the mounting plate.

, I built this plate to be mounted in front of the hard drives with spacing for 92mm fan mounts which would blow air across the hard drives, Make sure there is an inch of space between the mount and the hard drive sleds! I also made a hole for a 22mm power switch, which would be pushed through both the plate and the front panel. A mount for front panel connectors such as USB 3.0 ports can be cut into this as well.

, On mine, these need to fit over the mounts on the top and bottom of the component plate. I added spaces for 120mm fan mounts on both panels.

, The ones I designed are to be pushed into the top and bottom much like the wood stubs for the hard drives. Make sure to correctly measure where the IO shield and front panel connectors (switches, USB ports) would fit on the front and back panels.

, These need to fit in the spacing on the front and back panels. Also add air intakes to give the components adequate cooling and to keep the wood from becoming less fatigued.

, If you're happy with your design, you can send it to company that does laser cutting to get your plywood parts. Assembling your computer should take under an hour.

Keep driving until the highway turns into its first curve to the left and you’ll see some small lodgings on the left-hand side of the road; this is the area where you can find the Altruists.;
, Drive slowly around the curve and on the right-hand side of the road you’ll find a parked car. Beside the car will be two naked old men harassing a girl on the ground. These are the rogue Altruists you’re looking for.

, Step out of your car and slowly approach the two men. One of the two men will threaten you and tell you to walk away.

, Take out your gun by pressing the corresponding weapon button on your controller and shoot at the two Altruists. They won’t be wearing any armor so it’s very easy to take them down with only one or two bullets to the body.


You could also kill the rogue Altruists with a melee weapon like a bat or a knife, but since one of the two old men has a gun, it’s best to simply shoot them down.

, Once the two Altruists are dead, the girl will ask you to take her home in Sandy Shores up north in Harmony. Get in your car and she’ll ride with you. To get to her house, take the same highway you took from the Redwood Lights Track.


Keep driving pass the Redwood Lights Track heading north until you get to the first crossing. Turn right at the crossing and drive for another block where you’ll see a green house on the right-hand side of the road. She’ll tell you to stop at the front, and she’ll get out of your car, completing the quest. She’ll reward you with $80 for your trouble.

Speak with Caesar.,
Follow Caesar’s orders.",How to Join Caesar's Legion in Fallout: New Vegas," Once you complete the quest “Ring-a-Ding-Ding,” you will exit the Tops Casino located on the New Vegas Strip. You will be confronted with one of Caesar’s men, who will bestow upon you a necklace called the Mark of Caesar, which gives you safe passage to the fort where Caesar is located. The Legionnaire will point you towards Cottonwood Cove, where you can board a boat to reach the fort.;
, Cottonwood Cove is a Legionnaire camp located at the southeast part of the map. There will be a set of docks along the river near the campsites. Locate the campsites and stone buildings, then follow alongside the waterway to the docks. Speak to Lucullus the ferryman. He will be found beside a boat at the docks. He is easy to find since he is the only Legionnaire at the docks and the boat is the only boat near him. Walk up to him and speak with him.

, You can either speak with Lucullus to initiate the boat ride or click on the boat directly. However, if this is the first time seeing Lucullus, you will need to speak with him before you take the boat ride to the fort.

, As soon as you get off the boat, follow along the dirt pathway passing by Legionnaire guards. The dirt path can be found immediately and will take you all the way up to the fort. Follow it up the stairs until you reach the top of the hill.

, Enter the large gates at the top of the hill, and once inside, head straight towards Caesar’s tent. His tent is straight ahead; however, you will need to go around the fighting arena to reach the tent. The dirt pathway heads various ways around the inner workings of the fort. Luckily, you can easily see his tent as it is the largest one in the fort and is on top of a hill overseeing the fighting arena.

, Once you enter Caesar’s tent, he can be found straight ahead sitting on his throne. Speak with him by clicking on him. When you speak with Caesar, he will order you to enter a vault behind his tent to destroy what is within. Caesar will give you the platinum chip to open the vault door.

, Make your way through the underground vault, killing the enemy defense robots within. Once you clear out the vault and make your way to the bottom, you have the option to either self-destruct the dormant robot army within or activate it. Use the platinum chip to operate the console, which will give you the option to either activate the army or initiate the self-destruct sequence. Whichever you decide, you will never get to interact with the robot army. You will instead be able to see them through a window from the operations console room.


Whatever choice you make, Caesar won’t know the difference as he will just hear a sound from below the fort, thinking that you destroyed what was inside. If you do activate the robot army, Mr. House will be pleased with your decision.
You will be serving for Caesar once you complete this task. From there on, Caesar will order you to do various quests (as part of the Legion), including killing Mr. House, gaining support from the Boomers, dealing with the White Glove Society, and destroying the Brotherhood of Steel.

Try to be kind to everyone!,
Try to get physically strong!,
Look the part!,
Dress the part!,
Try to smile even though you may be in a hopeless situation!",How to Act Like Tifa Lockhart," At least give everyone a chance. You might be surprised by people. Tifa is described as a kind, although often quiet character. And even though she is physically strong, she is emotionally shy. Unless you already are shy by nature, acting shy is completely optional. Tifa is very friendly, and despite her often revealing choice of clothing, you'd never hear a bad word from her. She is also rather independent.;
, When Tifa fought Loz in Advent Children, she moved with ease and proved to have very strong arms in particular. Make sure to do something physically challenging every day! Run, bike, dance, learn how to do some kind of martial art, for example jujitsu, karate or maybe even taekwondo. Make sure to stay in shape, and you'll gain a much healthier life style while you're at it, too!

, Tifa has long, dark brown hair, red eyes, sometimes appearing brown, and tan skin. If you're like me, and have blond hair, blue eyes and sorta pale skin, have no fear! You could just try to get a tan in the summer, and if you want to, but only if you want to, you could get a fake tan in the winter. As for the hair, if you don't want to dye it or you simply aren't allowed to, see if you can get highlights! They're more effective for the look than you might think. And when it comes to the eyes, you don't have to do anything special about them if you don't feel like it. Tifa also has very fair skin, so if you have dry skin, try to take a moisturizing lotion every night, and if you have acne, get acne medication. A bonus is that you'll probably feel more confident about yourself if you have fair skin, too. For makeup, use some black eyeliner and mascara. Don't use lipstick, just put on some lipbalm to make sure your lips stay good in general.

, In Final Fantasy VII, Tifa wears a white tank top, a black skirt with red boots and red gloves. In Advent Children, she wears a white top under a black zip-up vest and black shorts which fold at the waist, creating an additional utility pocket at the front, plus a short duster at the back extending to her heels with black and white sort of converse like short boots, and black leather gloves. IN Crisis Core, she wears a cowgirl outfit with cowboy boots and a brown skirt with a leather vest and a cowboy hat. Seeing as you probably don't want to wear only these three outfits every single day, try to wear neutral colours like black, white, brown and the occasional red and blue. Often wear quite short skirts, shorts and tank tops. If it's too cold to wear this, try to have leggings underneath, or maybe jeans and a tunic.

, Tifa is known for being bright and optimistic and she cheers up the other when they are down.

Create a background story.,
Now, you're going to need to know the main rules about roleplaying.",How to Roleplay on San Andreas Multiplayer," Roleplay is acting as if you're in real life so you're going to need a character name such as Emilio_Carino.


Once you have your name, you'll need to determine where he/she is from, how old he/she is and how tall he/she is, also how much he/she weighs. This is extremely important for roleplay because you'll need to communicate with other people and you need to fit in the right group or you'll get hurt.;
, You're going to need to know the following terms: Metagaming, Powergaming, Bunnyhopping, Deathmatching, Revenge killing, In character, Out of Character. There are so much more but these are the main terms you must know. So, we'll start off with metagaming.


Metagaming is using out of character information, in character. So, let's say your friend is getting robbed and he private messages you where he's getting robbed and by who, so you come over and kill the robbers. This is metagaming as you didn't find this out in character.
Powergaming is forcing action upon another character without allowing them to roleplay back such as you punching your enemy and creating the emote with this; *Emilio Carino punches John Doe in the face, breaking his nose and knocking him out* This is powergaming and is not allowed. There is another type of powergaming which is doing things that are physically and mentally impossible such as *Emilio Carino picks up a garbage truck, throwing it over a tall building* This is impossible and considered powergaming.
Bunnyhopping is quite simple, bunnyhopping is pressing the jump button multiple times in a row to get somewhere quicker and abusing the system.
Deathmatching is killing someone for a horrible reason such as killing because he/she told you to f**k off.
Revenge killing is killing someone who has previously killed you within an hour or so and they haven't done anything. Once someone has killed you, it means that you cannot approach them again and kill them or have previous memories.
In Character is asking as if you were in real life.
Out of Character is PMs, and other things with the out of character brackets (( ))

Ensure you have a legitimate copy of San Andreas installed.,
Download the mod from sa-mp.com.,
Run the installation file.,
Optionally, download and install a server client.,
When you're ready to play, run the SA-MP file.,
Find an appealing server.,
Join a server by right clicking and selecting ""Connect"".,
Enjoy!,
Familiarize yourself with SA-MP's interface while you play.,
Observe good etiquette while you play.,
If you can't get SA-MP to run, try downgrading to V 1.0.,
If SA-MP still won't run, remove any other mods.,
For connectivity problems, adjust your firewall settings.,
If other players' nametags are invisible, get a new graphics card.",How to Play Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Multiplayer," SA-MP, the program that allows you to play San Andreas as a multiplayer game, is a mod (short for ""modification""). This means that, for the mod to work, you must already have San Andreas installed on your computer. As a standalone program, the mod has no gameplay capability. Ensure that you have a functional copy of the game installed before proceeding.


To be perfectly clear, it's impossible to play San Andreas multiplayer without already having the game installed on your computer.

Note that, in addition to the system requirements for the base copy of San Andreas, the SA-MP additionally requires 5.6 MB of hard drive space and an internet connection (broadband is recommended for smooth play).;
, When you're ready to begin, visit the official SA-MP site, sa-mp.com, to find the San Andreas Multiplayer mod. From the site's main home page, click ""Downloads"" in the tab on the left side of the screen. On the next screen, click any of the download links for the main SA-MP client (the option at the top of the page) to begin to download your file.


Downloading the SA-MP client is free, and, because of the install file's relatively small size at roughly 11 MB, will not take long on most systems.

, When your download has completed, run the installation file by finding it in your download directory and double-clicking on it or selecting ""Run"" or the equivalent option from your browser's download menu. An installation wizard should pop up with simple instructions guiding you through the rest of the process. Follow the prompts to complete the installation of SA-MP.


During the installation process, you'll be asked to specify the directory in which your copy of San Andreas is installed. The relevant ""Destination Folder"" text box comes pre-filled with the game's default installation directory, so if you installed San Andreas in the default directory, you won't have to do anything besides click ""Install"". However, if you installed San Andreas in a different directory, you'll need to locate this directory by clicking the ""Browse..."" button next to the text box and selecting the game's installation directory.

, Besides a valid copy of San Andreas, all you'll need to play online multiplayer is the mod discussed above. However, if you'd like to host online game servers, rather than simply play them, you'll need to download and install an additional server client. The client is available for both Windows and Linux operating systems from the same download page as the main mod client above.Note that the download package that contains the server client also contains the PAWN scripting tools used for creating custom scenarios in SA-MP. See the SA-MP wiki for more information on scripting., After installing the main mod client and/or the optional server client, you're ready to play! The automatic installation process should have created a shortcut on your desktop named ""San Andreas Multiplayer"". Simply click this icon to launch the mod. If you don't see the shortcut, you may need to check for the San Andreas Multiplayer file in your main San Andreas directory.


When you run this file, a browser window titled ""San Andreas Multiplayer"" should launch. In the next section, we'll use this browser to find and join a game.

, After launching the SA-MP browser window, click the ""Internet"" tab at the bottom of the window to populate the windows with game servers. From here, you're able to browse the list of available servers by using the scroll buttons.


Note that you can also filter results by map, game mode, and several other criteria by using the tools in the ""Filter"" section at the bottom left of the window.

, When you're ready to play, select the server you want to join from the master list by clicking on it, then right click and select the ""Connect"" option. If all goes well, you'll be connected to the game server and you'll be able to start playing immediately.


Note that some private servers (usually created for play among friends or groups of people who know each other) are password-protected. If you don't know the password to the server, you won't be able to join.

, From this point forward, you'll be playing in one of many online scenarios and interacting with other SA-MP players. The type of game you play and the quality of your experience is up to you. While SA-MP is home to dozens of custom game modes, some of the most common are listed below:DM (Deathmatch): Players compete (in teams or individually) to see who can kill their enemies the greatest number of times.
CTF (Capture the Flag): Teams of players attempt to score points by stealing the flags from each others' home bases and returning them to their own.
Freighter: One team guards a secure base, while the other team attempts to infiltrate.
Moneygrub/Land Grab: Players compete to acquire the most wealth and/or real estate.
Cops and Robbers (aka Cops N Gangs): Players are grouped into teams of criminals and police and compete in a variety of objectives (for instance, one scenario may have the teams both trying to capture the same van).
Free roam : No objectives! Simply explore the landscape at your leisure.
...and more!

, While the actual core gameplay of SA-MP is very similar, if not identical, to single-player San Andreas gameplay, certain aspects of the mod's interface can be confusing to first-timers. Some of the interface changes you may want to make note of are:The chatbox: this addition to the upper-left corner of the screen allows the players in the game. Use the T or F6 key to chat. Toggle the chatbox on and off with F7.
The kill info window: this new window located on the right side of the screen provides information about each player's in-game deaths. The window shows who has killed who, in addition to the method of death. Toggle the window on and off with F9.
The class selection screen. The first thing you see when you begin your game will be the class selection screen. On this screen, you can choose your character's skin, or appearance. Depending on the gamemode, the skin you select may have an effect on which team you are on or your role in the game.

, Online SA-MP game servers aren't necessarily the most serious, dignified places to be — both the conversation and the game content itself can range from irreverent to downright vulgar. However, the vast majority of players will ultimately want to have good, clean fun. Some bad apples, however, are heart-set on ruining the game experience for others. To avoid being one of these people, try to observe the following in-game etiquette:


Don't be a sore loser. Hurling insults at other players or deliberately sabotaging the game after you lose is pretty pathetic.
Don't cheat. Using custom-made ""hacks"" or deliberately exploiting in-game mechanics doesn't just rob other players of the chance at a fair competition — it also robs you of the chance to score a real victory.
Don't use abusive language. Racism, sexism, and other ugly prejudices have no place in the SA-MP community.
Don't spam. Mindlessly shouting or re-posting the same text over and over again isn't funny, so don't do it.

, One of the most common errors encountered in SA-MP stems from the fact that later versions of the core San Andreas game (like 2.0, 3.0, etc.) are somewhat incompatible with many mods, including SA-MP. Luckily, free third-party utilities exist for ""downgrading"" San Andreas from a later version to 1.0 (one such utility is available from the main SA-MP download site). If you are experiencing problems with SA-MP and your copy of San Andreas is not V 1.0, download, install, and run one of these utilities to switch back to V 1.0


One common error that occurs because of this version mismatch is that, upon launching a game through the SA-MP client, the single-player version of San Andreas will load, rather than the multiplayer mod.
Another error that can occur is that the mod may not even launch at all. Instead, in this situation, the error message ""San Andreas cannot be found"" displays.

, Another common problem that can prevent SA-MP from running results from compatibility issues with other mods. Running several mods at once can cause conflicting modifications to the game's code which can make the game unstable and prone to crashing or even prevent it from loading in the first place. The easiest way to work around this issue is usually to disable or uninstall the offending mods before running SA-MP.

, Firewalls are great for protecting your computer from viruses, malware, and other online hazards, but they can be a serious pain when you're trying to get online games to work. By restricting the types of traffic that can flow into and out of your computer, certain firewall settings can prevent SA-MP from connecting to game servers. Unfortunately, because your situation may vary depending on your firewall and the settings you've chosen for it, there's no one single solution that will solve all connectivity problems. Consult your firewall's maker for more information.


Common connectivity problems include not being able to see any servers in the SA-MP browser window and the game stopping at the ""Connecting to ip:port..."" message when connecting to a game.

, Some low-end PCs, particularly those with hard drive-integrated graphics cards, rather than separate, dedicated graphics cards, have difficulty displaying all the graphical information in SA-MP. One common symptom of this is that other players' nametags are rendered invisible. Because this problem is caused by an inherent lack of graphical processing power in the computer itself, a hardware upgrade is the only definitive fix. Compared to the price of a new graphics card, simply ignoring this problem may be preferable.


Note that some game modes  can have nametags disabled as an aspect of the gameplay.

Don't worry too much about taking territory early on.",How to Start a Gang in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas," You gain and lose Respect as you proceed through the game, and it is one of the hardest stats to increase. There are a variety of factors that influence the Respect that you gain or lose. Below is how the Total Respect bar is broken down to total 100%:


Running Respect: 40%
Completing Missions: 36%
Territories owned: 6%
Total money: 6%
Muscle: 4%
Progress with girlfriend: 4%
Appearance: 4%;
, 40% of your Total Respect comes from the Running Respect category. These are actions that you can take throughout the game that add or subtract from this total. Below are the actions that can gain or lose your Running Respect. Remember that these actions just affect your Running Respect, which makes up 40% of the Total Respect:Killing a dealer: +.005%
Killing a rival gang member: +.5%
Killing a Grove Street gang members: –.005%
One of your gang members dies: –2%
Take a territory: +30%
Lose a territory: –3%

, Your Total Respect will increase as you complete missions, gain money, workout, and dress up. As your Total Respect increases, you'll gain the ability to command more gang members.1%: 2 gang members
10%: 3 gang members
20%: 4 gang members
40%: 5 gang members
60%: 6 gang members
80%: 7 gang members

, You'll find Grove Street members near your starting area, and in any Grove Street territories. You'll be able to tell that they're Grove Street by their green clothing., You'll need to aim your gun at the Grove Street member that you want to recruit.

PC: Right-mouse button
PS2: R1

Xbox:  RT 


, Once you have the Grove Street member targeted, press the recruit button to get them to join you. Remember, you can only recruit as many members as your current Respect level allows.PC: Press G. You may have changed this when setting your controls, so refer to the Settings menu if this doesn't work.

, Any of your gang members that are following you will try to get into your car automatically. Get a four-person car to get the most firepower possible. Drive past enemy gang members and your recruits will start shooting automatically.


If you have more than three gang members following you, you'll only be able to transport them by bus and they won't all shoot out of the windows.

, Your gang members will follow you around, though they are quite a bit slower than you are. Recruits will automatically shoot back at anyone that attacks you, and will fire on rival gang members and cops on sight. Make sure not to leave them behind if you're in a hurry.

, You can give your recruits a command to hurry to your current location.

, This mission will unlock the Gang Wars feature, and will allow you to take and defend territory from rival gangs. You'll need to complete the mission before you can start taking territory.

, Taking territory will earn you money, as well as provide some fun gunfights. Territory that you control is also safer to travel through, as the rival gangs will be replaced by your crew. Check your map for colored blocks, indicating ownership by a rival gang. Darker shades on the map indicate a larger number of rival gang members, while lighter shades mean less resistance.


Purple - Ballas
Yellow - Los Santos Vagos

, Round up as many Grove Street recruits as your Respect level will allow. They aren't that great in a fight, but they're good for distracting enemies from shooting at you.

, In order to initiate a Turf Battle, you'll need to kill three rival gang members while inside the colored block. Finding three rival gang members isn't an issue in the darkly-shaded blocks, but it can be difficult to find three in the lightly-shaded blocks. One trick is to stand in a lightly-shaded block and shoot into a neighboring darkly-shaded box.

, Once the turf war has started, the block will begin flashing on the map. Rival gang members will begin appearing in three waves of increasing difficulty. You'll need to fight off all three waves in order to take control of the block.


Find a high spot that allows you to easily shoot down into the street. This can make it easier to protect yourself from getting surrounded.

, Without going into too many spoilers, you won't be able to do gang battles for most of the middle of the game, and all of your early progress will be undone during the story. Only worry about gang wars when they're first introduced if you really need the money.


Taking over 100% of the territory is not required in order to 100% complete the game, but once you've taken all of the blocks, none of them will come under attack from rival gangs.

The rioting is basically done just by a bunch of cheats combined together.,
When you get use to the riots and are ready to face the big-time killing, type in this final cheat.",How to Start a Perfect Riot in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas," if you have never typed in a cheat code before, you must simply press the buttons during gameplay without messing them up.I will Explain which ones you need to put in and what they do to help.


First cheat, circle, right, circle, right, left, square, triangle, up. this cheat will stop the cops from chasing after you. Now you will never have any stars appear. This is an important cheat because the whole city will be going crazy and you will be the only one getting into trouble. This cheat will stop that. So now you won't get chased by the cops.
Press L2, right, L1, up, X, L1, L2, R2, R1, L1, L1, L1. This cheat will make more crappy cars appear on the streets. More crappy cars will make it seem more like a riot.
Next, R2, circle, r1, L2, left, R1, L2, left, R1 L1, R2, L2. This is an important cheat. it will bring the riot to the streets. cars will not stop for traffic or lights, they will constantly run people over and cops will chase after many of them. Many more pursuits and drive-bys will occur now.
Next, and most importantly, L2 right, L1, triangle, right, right, R1, L1, right, L1, L1, L1. This is the most important one because this will officially launch the riot. People will beat up each other, buildings and houses will be burning, you will hear the loud yells and screams of the rioters. Many will be stealing thing and you can see them run away with a TV or a radio. You will hear constant gunshots. Helicopters will constantly be patrolling with searchlights looking for rioters to shoot. (If you look closely, you can tell that nobody is flying the helicopters.) Drivers will be pulled out of their cars and beaten to death. Cars will constantly explode. It is exactly like the rioting experienced (Spoiler) on the last few missions.;
, R2, R1, X, triangle, X, up, down, R1, L1, L1. Now the rioters will have access to guns! There will be 10x more carnage and killing. You will have a much bigger chance of being killed now.

Learn how to change the wanted level.,
Learn how to get the vehicles.,
Learn how to handle shootouts.",How to Play GTA San Andreas Without Resorting to Cheats," If you cannot play well, you may want to avoid doing anything especially dangerous or foolish in the game. Remember, cheating can make certain missions impossible to complete and it can also damage the game irreparably.;
, Instead of cheating to get more health, you can regenerate by eating, drinking soda, or getting in an ambulance. All of the above options offer very little health increases, but they are much better than cheating.

, A normal newbie or cheater will just usually spawn 'em. But where is the fun with that? The only other option that you have is to hunt for them, which can be both tedious and dangerous. Cheating, however, can have the more dangerous effect of lowering your Criminal Rating.

, By gambling, killing drug dealers, or performing a bike stunt off of the Los Santos tower, you can get money. (If the gambling backfires, you can reset the game.)

, Like usual, many players will take the easy and dishonest route to adjust their wanted level. Despite this, there are simple tricks on how to remove wanted level, such as receiving ""bribes"", taking special missions, or saving the game.

, Unfortunately, many of these are obtainable solely by cheating. To get the cool vehicles, you may have to do some things that resemble cheating. For the Phoenix, you can save it to your garage, and it will stay there. The Monster truck, Hotring racer, and the Bloodring banger can all be attained by normal gameplay means. (The Monster truck and Hotring racer can be attained at the Stadium in Los Santos just a few feet far behind Grove Street. It is very easy, just do the P.I.T. Maneuver which will make them spin out of control and give you advantages. Do not destroy them, under any circumstances.) The Hunter, Hydra and Stuntplane can also be attained without cheats, but the Hunter and Stuntplane will require you to do some tasks at the AC tower Graveyard, while the Hydra is obtained throughout the storyline. To get the Stuntplane, get at least silver on all of the tests at the Tower. For the Hunter, finish all of the tests with the rank ""Gold."" It may be hard at first, but you will find it easy after a few gaming hours.

, Normally, players will use a Rocket Launcher and fire. It is easier to just get the miniguns which will not be obtained through cheats, but by finding them. The Minigun is extremely powerful because it is capable of destroying a car with just 3 bullets, and it has 500 bullets by default. If you take it from Toreno's ranch (a place where powerful guns spawn for free), you will only have 200 bullets, but with a bit of cheating (repeatedly saving and reacquiring the weapon), you can easily get past 200 rounds.

Shoot the drivers of the motorcycles, and the engines of the cars.,
Pre-aim the gun (and hold down the shooting button,) to make shooting easier.",How to Pass the Tough Missions in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas1," The game will complain, but as long as you do not lose them (then you have a big problem because without the bike they do not get a marker on the map), you will be fine. Switch cars under the freeway intersection (where your homies stop) so that you do not catch fire.
, Getting into a car raises enemy accuracy (obviously) and it stays high even after getting out of the car (I do not know when it turns back to normal though). If you switch from the car to a two-wheeler, their accuracy drops by a factor of 3! (proof: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2Z-62GSk9E) This fact applies to (afaik) every single enemy in the game: if you get into a car after he has spawned, he will become very accurate; if you then get onto a bike, his accuracy is back to normal. In many missions, this 'bug' is not an issue because the enemies are spawned after CJ has left his vehicle but for the rest, keep it in mind., They should be as accurate as if you had been in a car (see ""Sweet's Girl"") so do not underestimate them.^^, The race will be SO much easier if you do. Another good option is a Savannah (although not as fast with as good of steering as a Voodoo.) Some speed runners use the Remington which drives away from the meet in the mission ""Cesar Vialpando"" instead., Else they are probably going to spin or crash into you which cost a lot more than one second., And gradually work your way to the right lane, for the 1st real turn. Watch out for the poles. The Voodoo has very good top speed, so it will be easy to lose the competitors on the straights., This will make it easier for your car during the turns., Don't crash, look at what's ahead of you. Don't hit any poles, etc. And it should be easy to win the race by a large margin. Also, you can use the right stick to look around corners, to see farther, etc., or the left stick (push forward on it) to see farther ahead. This makes safe driving at fast speeds much easier., This will make the motorcycle handle much better, and will let CJ lean forward for more speed, if you want. OG will magically appear at the end., It's much easier to know where to go if you've seen the route before. It may help to watch some videos to learn where to turn, etc. The turn off of the highway is right after the billboard or overhead street sign., You don't have to catch Jeffrey, and there are some places where he stops and waits (but he doesn't stop and wait once on the highway.) So the main thing is to not crash., the downhill before the highway,) release the accelerator, to slow down, and to get more control over the bike, etc., The following is the 'pro' strategy: twitch.tv/tduva/c/4053924?t=17m0s In the two areas he is shooting him, he is not invulnerable for a short period of time after the short stop (where normally he waits for you if you are far away), so you memorize the first stopping location, drive straight there (it won't fail the mission), wait for him and then you can kill him using auto-aiming with a good gun. Try the AK or maybe the shotgun., That will let Big Smoke shoot the gang members without hitting the train instead. Most people drive too close to the train., That will make the mission easier. Also in general, line up Big Smoke with the gang member he's shooting. That will make it easier for him to hit the target., Skip the cars that get taken out automatically by the rig., The bikes always take the same path, so you can make shooting and aiming much easier by pre-aiming the gun."

Insert the GTA: San Andreas CD into your computer's CD drive.,
If the autorun window doesn't display, open the install file manually.,
Choose a directory in which to install the game.,
Choose between ""Complete"" and ""Custom"" install types.,
Wait for the game to install.,
After the installation is ready, insert the ”Play” CD.,
Consult Rockstar Games' online troubleshooting resources if you can't get your copy of the game to run.",How to Install Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas1," To begin the installation process, put the San Andreas installation CD in your computer. Most of the time, this will cause an autorun window prompting you to begin the installation process to appear immediately.


San Andreas is a decade-old game and, as such, has relatively low system requirements. Most modern computers should be powerful enough to run it. However, if you're not sure of your computer's suitability, consult Rockstar Games' official system requirements for San Andreas.;
, For a number of reasons (for instance, because the game isn't designed for modern hardware), it's possible that the autorun prompt won't immediately launch when you insert the San Andreas CD. If it doesn't, try opening the game disc via ""My Computer"" and running the executable (.exe) install file.

, Follow the installation wizard's prompts as directed. Eventually, you'll be asked to specify a location to install the game in. The vast majority of users will want to go with the default location, but if you'd like to install the game elsewhere, specify your desired file location in the text box.

, Eventually, you will be asked to choose whether you want a ""complete"" or ""custom"" installation. Most users will want the pre-selected ""complete"" option, as it's simpler and easier. However, if you'd like to save disc space by choosing which specific game components you'd like to install, choose ""custom"" and follow the additional instructions.

, When you've finalized your installation choices, the game will begin to install. This process can take several minutes to complete.

, Once the installation has completed, you should be able to play your game. Insert the ""Play"" CD and begin playing your game via the onscreen Autorun menu that should appear.


If the autorun doesn't appear, try manually running the game's .exe file with the disc inserted.

, As noted above, San Andreas is a fairly old game. Because of this, you may experience difficulty getting the game to run even after a successful installation. If you're having trouble, try visiting Rockstar Games' support forumsfor help.

Abandon the quad and use a bike.,Load up on SMG ammo (or the sub-machine gun of your choice) before the mission, and shoot the vehicles yourself.,

Using the Buffalo is fine for this one. Go fast during the straights, but take the turns safely., For the farm, go to the left of it, sliding along that wall. Be careful on the next bridge also, and the next downhill, towards the water. And watch out for the bump in the grass on the last turn, going up the hill. You can use that as a guide for making that turn easier too., (You can use that bump to help you turn also.), That will put you well ahead of the rest of the cars., It will be easy to win the race once you're ahead of the competitors. The main thing is not speed here, but to simply not crash, or to go a wrong way, etc., For the farm, go between to the two buildings to the right of the corona, but watch out for the fence afterwards., The car doesn't turn as well if you're holding down the accelerator button."

It helps a lot to get the homing rocket launcher before this mission.,
Drive ahead of the preacher's limo.,
Don't shoot at the bikes.,
At the beginning, you can often position yourself to grab one or two packages from the bikes right away.,
For regular bike driving, drive on the center line to avoid most of the traffic.,
Use the homing rocket launcher for this one.,Approach the helipad from the east side to make it easier.,
these do not work, you cannot acquire a military helicopter before flight school (all gold even, iirc) and the pilot spawns after you reach the helipad and the heli is already in mid-air as the cutscene ends.,

Shoot the planes while they're far away.,Get the groups of planes in particular.,Once a plane has passed by or dropped its bomb, it may be possible to ignore it entirely after that, so move to the next planes.,
Concentrate on accuracy.,
To fly the plane, simply hold down the accelerator (although you may want to release it while shooting to give you more time to shoot,) and use small left-stick adjustments to control the plane.,
Start with the nearby courier, then the bike one, then the SUV one (usually west,) then check the map.",How to Pass the Tough Missions in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas3," To get that, drive a car up next to the guard station at the airport. Have CJ climb on top of the car, then jump up onto the office. Then run around to open the gates. Also, you can park your car in front of the gate to keep it open, and just stand CJ on the line between the sidewalk and the road, to make the jump onto the top of the office. The rocket launcher is on the eastern-most side of the airport, between some fuel tanks, which are to the right of the hangars south (or right) of the control tower., (Don't shoot them yet.) Get out far enough ahead, and aim the homing rocket launcher. Shoot the limo twice, and it will be done. Also make sure it's far enough away to protect the pimp-mobile., Simply drive up close and press the appropriate button (L1 on ps2) repeatedly to grab the package off of the back., Use the middle line for the road as a reference., But watch for turning cars, etc. If you can, drive on the side of the road, if there's a gap between the sidewalk and the traffic., (See ""Jizzy"" steps for how to get it.) Simply shoot it twice before the helicopter turns the corner.,, If you would like it to be even easier, you can always chase Toreno in a hunter or simply use the sniper rifle on the pilot before take-off. Do not chase the chopper in a car!, If a cop approaches the car while CJ's getting in, honk the horn to keep him from getting too close., To make the minigun more stable while aiming, release the firing button. And move between targets quickly to help save time.,,, If you shoot the gun accurately right from the get-go, the mission will be much easier. Watch the sparks of the machine gun hitting, to see where it's actually hitting. Once you have accuracy, you can shoot the couriers from much farther away, which is quicker, easier, safer for the Red Baron, etc., Most people's mistake is making too big of movements with the left stick, causing the plane to go everywhere. Use the degree of the plane's bank to control the turning speed of the plane, with an occasional pulling back., If the van courier has gone somewhere way too far, it's usually best to retry the mission. (It can happen sometimes.) Otherwise, get the Sanchez next. It's particularly important to get the Sanchez from far away (accuracy), because it can really shoot up the Red Baron. Then get the van courier, and head straight back for the home base. Try to keep the plane flying level to maximize speed. And just fly into the corona."

It helps so much if you use the pause trick to get a good time.,
Do the pause trick until before the car reaches the first turn.,
Continue the race as normal, without the pause trick.,
For the turns, concentrate on using the handbrake to turn the car quickly, and watching the side of the car and the inside cone (the one on the end.),To fix the camera after a turn, simply tap or click R2 or L2 (the side-view buttons on the ps2) quickly, to reset the camera to looking directly forward.,
Use the pause trick (see Burn and Lap) to gain an incredible advantage in this.,
In general, it helps to use the trolley tracks as a guide, to avoid the traffic.,Release the accelerator on tough turns, to keep the car from sliding out, and use the right or left sticks to look farther forward, to get a better view of the road, traffic, etc.",How to Pass the Tough Missions in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas4," Here is how you do the pause trick: When the race beginning shows up, press Pause. Then while exiting the menu, hold down X (the accelerator.) Then as it exits the menu, quickly press Pause again. Doing this, you can start the car moving, and drive, without starting the timer., (If you go farther than that, it won't count the first turn.), You have now gotten a 2-3 second head start. (This is an easy way to get gold on it too.), Concentrate on starting the handbrake turn as soon as possible, but not too soon.,, You can save 45+ seconds using the pause trick all the way to the first corona. (You can't do it after that, because it won't count the corona.), Also, you can go drive on the sidewalk down by the docks for a good, easy, clear line. But with the pause trick, it will be easy to get gold no matter what route you use.,"

Download San Andreas from a reputable source.,
Extract the downloaded file.,
Run the install file.,
Follow the install prompts as directed.,
Avoid pirating games.",How to Install Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas2," To begin, you'll want to obtain a functioning, virus-free copy of San Andreas. Only download from ""clean"", reputable online sources or reliable torrents. Never download anything from sites that you're not familiar with, that look suspicious, or that contain pervasive advertisements.


If you're ever unsure whether a certain website is safe, try downloading and using any of the free or paid online security utilities available via a simple Google search.

, Usually, downloaded or torrented copies of games come in a ""compressed"" form that must be decompressed (or ""unzipped"") before they can be used. Locate the compressed file you downloaded, right click on it, and choose ""Extract"" or a related option (which may vary based on the zip utilities you have installed). Then, specify a location for the decompressed file as directed.


To unzip a compressed file, you'll need a special type of application made for this purpose. Luckily, there are a variety of free and paid solutions available for download. For example, 7zip, a free utility, should serve most unzipping needs.

, After you've unzipped the .exe install file, find it in the file location you specified and run it. You should be presented with an introductory screen offering options for beginning the installation process.

, Because ""hacks"" or ""cracks"" of games are, by their very nature, unofficial and non-uniform, the precise process for installing your downloaded game copy may differ from that of another. Usually, all you'll need to due is follow the prompts of the decompressed install file as you would for a normal copy of the game.


One thing you may need to do to get the installed game to work is to ""mount"" an ISO image of the game disc to a virtual drive. Essentially, this is a process by which the computer is tricked into thinking that the game disc is inserted when it is not. See wikiHow's guide on mounting ISO images for more information.

, The act of pirating computer games is considered illegal almost everywhere. Though anti-piracy measures are often not well-enforced (especially for decade-old games like San Andreas), piracy is still considered a crime. Additionally, there's virtually no way to determine the quality of a pirated copy of the game. Not only can pirating a game like San Andreas leave you open for criminal prosecution - it can also net you a buggy or non-functioning copy of the game. Finally, pirated copies of games are notorious for bearing viruses and other malware.If you choose to knowingly pirate computer games, you do so at your own risk.

Raise the landing gear quickly (R3 on ps2) to gain speed earlier.,
Use small flicks or adjustments of the left stick to control the plane, while holding down the accelerator.,
Fly the fuselage (body) of the plane through the inside edge of the corona.,
Using 3rd-person view is recommended, because that lets you see the plane and the corona.,
For landing, land early, and drive the plane like a car into the corona.",How to Pass the Tough Missions in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas5," Fly level at first to gain speed before climbing altitude., If you use large adjustments, the plane will go all over the place. Use rudder controls simply for correction, not for general steering., That way you can take a shorter path, which saves time, and will trigger every corona as you go through. For sharp turns, tilt the plane, then pull back. Then level out., So it's easier to save time., The main thing for gold is that it's lined up left and right, even if you go slightly past the corona (too far,) or don't stop directly in the center."
"
Use the homing rocket launcher, from the San Fierro airport.,
Fly over the ocean.,
This is apparently only tough on the PC version.,During the chase, the Dodo gets height 'for free', so steering up yourself is a waste of speed.,
On the original ps2 version, you can shoot the car from close-up right away with the AK-47 or M4 (and apparently also the sawed-off shotguns,) and it will stop right away.,
Otherwise, shoot one or two of Pulaski's wheels out at the beginning before he drives off.,
Three really cool ways to do the mission (first two are without any weapons) are these:

If you do not feel like watching them, 1 is turning his car before he gets in, so that he is forced to turn, giving you time to hijack his car, 2 is the same, but running against the car to turn it, 3 jumps on top of the car and waits until he crashes into a sign, then using that opportunity to hijack his car.

,
Get a car and go east on the freeway.,
After putting the bike on the Packer (truck), take the Julius Freeway north to the parking lot of the hospital.,
For the 3rd bike, cut across town, and go to the police station.,
For the 4th bike, go to the nearest overpass to the bike, and get out of your vehicle there.",How to Pass the Tough Missions in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas6," See ""Jizzy"" on how to get that., That's hands down the easiest way. Otherwise, fly towards the airport, and over the highway, but watch out for trees, poles, etc. that may not spawn until the last minute. Remember, use small adjustments of the left joystick for best control. Make sure not to go over the radar limit unless you want to get shot down by a Hydra., Apparently adjusting the frame rate will make this mission much easier.,, The close-up firepower of those weapons bypasses the immunity requirement of the car. So equip a regular weapon (i.e. a Tech-9) to *run* around the buildings, then quickly switch to the assault rifles and shoot the car from close-up range., That will make it easy to keep up with him.,, When you get to the first bike, simply get on the bike. Don't shoot the police officer., Run into the bike to knock the cop off it. Get onto the bike and go west to the highway., Get out of your vehicle early and shoot the 2 foot (0.6 m) cops next to the bike. Then you can just run up and get on the bike. Go north on the main Strip in Las Venturas, and there's a church there, with a ramp to the right of it. Use that ramp to get onto the highway easily., Shoot the last cop from a distance, to keep him from getting on the bike. Get on the bike, use the same overpass to get back onto the freeway, and put the bike on the packer, to complete the mission.

The key of this strategy is it avoids any long chases to get the bikes. So you can simply get on the bike, and put it on the packer.

"
"
Use the Hunter (military helicopter) or Rhino (tank) if possible.,
For the HPV-1000 (police motorcycle,) get a lot of ammo, and concentrate on keeping your distance from the cars.,
Keep shooting the car until it blows up.,
Use body armor, snacks / food, and police bribes to make it easier.,
OPTIONAL: An excellent trick for the HPV-1000, Ranger, or police car, is to use the mini-gun.,
Do them in Angel Pine.,
If you stay close enough to the main pack, you can shoot them with the sniper rifle at the end of the race (*before* CJ finishes it,) and it will move CJ into first place.,If there's a corona on the other side of the arena, just wait for a closer one to appear.,
Release the accelerator to make quicker turns than your opponents.,If you have to, ram through some cars to get to a corona nearby.,
If possible, use the train tracks to get to your destination.,
When not on the train tracks, try to stay off-road as much as possible.,Lean forward as much as possible to gain as much speed as possible.,
Hit the ramp, and before you land, lean the bike slightly forward, so the front wheel touches the ground first.",How to Pass the Tough Missions in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas7," Those are hands down the easiest way of doing the vigilante missions., If CJ's weapon skill is high, he probably has better range than them, so you can hang back and shoot them., That will hopefully get rid of all the criminals quickly. If you have to, while shooting and finishing off the vehicle, honk the horn , to keep cops on foot from approaching the bike. Honking the horn works on all pedestrians and cops, but not enemy gang members. Also don't let them approach too closely, because they could still knock CJ off the bike., Try to keep CJ's wanted level down to 2 stars or lower. And be extra careful on levels 10 through 12, because the shotguns can do a lot of damage., This blows up cars tremendously quickly. So drive to where you can get a quick shot on the cars, jump out, and fire away. The mini-gun is difficult to come by though at the beginning of the game. (It's in Las Venturas.), It's very easy there. Also, Fort Carson may work., This does not work with all weapons.,, This also tends to throw off their aiming.,, It is so much easier like that. If you go through Los Santos, stay as far away from the roadblocks as possible, while going full speed. And if you go through the desert, be careful to not jack knife the truck when going downhill in the tunnel., Obviously use your judgment; don't drive on rain-soaked grass on a hillside. Plan your route out carefully, so you don't have to backtrack or try to make a U-turn.,, If the front wheel touches the ground slightly before the back wheel, and you've gone far enough (i.e. right before where you stop,) the game will count it as a stoppie, making an easy gold."

Start with stamina.,
Build other physical stats.,
Master vehicle stats.,
Become a weapons master.",How to Be Good at Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas1," Unlike other GTA games, San Andreas' protagonist, Carl “CJ” Johnson has a wide array of stats that can be altered by player choices. With high stats, missions get significantly easier; with low stats, they can become next to impossible. Start with the easiest and cheapest stat to train, stamina. Every in-game day, spend some time sprinting CJ around until he gets tired. Other ways to improve stamina include riding a bicycle and swimming.


The gyms around town also provide exercise equipment for quickly and efficiently improving CJ's stamina and other physical stats. Try the treadmill and the exercise bike.
You can get stamina as high as you want with no ill effects. Eventually, once you complete the optional “Burglar” mission (by stealing a total of $10,000 worth of goods from houses), CJ will be granted functionally infinite stamina; before then, training it will save his life in cop chases and other high-energy situations.;
, In addition to stamina, CJ has muscle mass and body fat whose percentages can be altered with work. To build muscle mass, lift weights at the gym. You're aiming for a rating of around 75-85% to maximize physical strength without sacrificing speed or agility. Body fat can be lowered to about 5% with no ill effects; get rid of it completely, and CJ may lose muscle mass during strenuous physical activity. All exercise decreases fat over time.


You may also want to build up CJ's lung capacity, allowing him to stay underwater for longer periods of time. Lung capacity can be trained by swimming underwater until the last second and then surfacing for air. Finding oysters on the ocean floor also has a minor effect on it. Lung capacity isn't exceptionally useful except in a few places.
Don't forget to eat properly as you train. Eating most foods will cause CJ to gain some fat, but food is also very important to building stamina and muscle mass. Whenever you eat, if your body fat is above about 3%, order a salad, as it's the only food that doesn't add fat. If you're practically out of fat, eat anything else to gain it back (up to 3% per meal), then work it back down to around 5% before each mission.

, In between training CJ's body, spend time driving or piloting everything you can get your hands on. There are four vehicle stats: bicycles, motorcycles, automobiles, and aircraft. The only way to train any of them is to ride a vehicle of the appropriate type. As CJ's skill goes up, vehicles begin to handle better in terms of turning, braking, and general stability. High skill with motorcycles and bicycles also gives CJ a better chance to avoid being knocked off his ride when hit by a car.


Mastering vehicle stats takes a fair amount of time. Just keep at it steadily and space out your vehicle training with other types of training sessions.

, CJ's weapon skills are trainable just like his vehicle skills; unfortunately, as opposed to those, there's a separate skill gauge for nearly every individual weapon. Weapon skills are trained by shooting people or vehicles, and range from “Poor” to “Hitman.” At the Hitman level, CJ can dual wield some weapons, including sawn-off shotguns, pistols, and machine pistols (the Micro-Uzi and the Tec-9).


Some weapons can't be trained. These include thrown weapons like grenades, sniper rifles, all melee weapons (bats, hammers, etc.), and all heavy weapons, such as the rocket launcher. CJ will deal more damage with a melee weapon if his muscle mass is high.
It can be difficult to safely train CJ's weapon skills, since shooting people will get you into hot water with the police in short order, and shooting vehicles only counts until the vehicles are destroyed (at which point they explode). Try shooting from nearby a save point or change of clothes, both of which will reduce your wanted level when used.

"
"
Raise your respect level.,
Save up money.,
Complete the training side missions.,
Find special items.,
Collect useful vehicles.,
Think laterally.",How to Be Good at Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas2," Respect is another stat that can be raised in GTA San Andreas, but unlike most of the stats listed above, it's next to impossible to raise it significantly from the beginning of the game. The higher your respect level, the more members of CJ's Grove Street Families gang you can recruit to help you with missions. Having a posse alongside you can make many missions significantly easier than they would be otherwise, so it pays to build a lot of respect.


Respect is gained in the normal course of the game by completing certain missions. You can also increase respect passively by making sure CJ wears green, the color of his gang, whenever he's inside Grove Street Families territory.
Conquering another gang's territory and annexing it (by starting and winning a gang war, which essentially involves shooting a whole bunch of gang members) will raise CJ's respect by a whole bunch (about 30%). Tagging over another gang's graffiti grants a small increase.
Killing drug dealers, police officers, and members of rival gangs grants slight increases to respect. Killing your own gang members, or letting them die, reduces respect.

, Fairly early on in the game, it's possible to start making a decent amount of money if you put your mind to it. Missions provide a good amount, of course; citizens can also be killed for their cash. Eventually, CJ can purchase businesses to provide him with regular income, but until that point, saving your money whenever you can afford to will grant you significant advantages later.


Drug dealers not only grant you respect when killed; they're also a great source of money. They tend to be short-tempered and well-armed, but if you snag a heavy vehicle like a semi truck and flatten them, they won't have much of a chance to fight back. You can also use sniper bullets to waste them from a distance.
Getting busted or wasted will cost you money. If you save regularly, you can just reload the game instead and avoid the fees, although they aren't really that high. Another hidden cost of getting wasted or busted is the loss of all your weapons. If you've managed to collect a nice little arsenal, consider reloading to save yourself the cost and trouble of finding or buying your guns again.
If you really want to game the system, save the game, then bet everything you have at an Inside Track betting shop. If you lose, reload and try again until you win. Each time you win, you'll multiply your money by a significant factor, and soon end up with more than you even knew you wanted.

This type of trick is commonly known as “save scumming.” It's effective, but many people consider it to be not in the spirit of the game, since it provides near-instant gratification with no immersion in the game world required. Set aside an extra save before you take advantage of it, just in case you find that the rest of the game's money missions become dull and lackluster afterward.



, There are a few basic types of side mission you can activate by appropriating specific vehicles. Paramedic missions activate from an ambulance, vigilante missions activate from a police or military vehicle, and taxi missions activate from a taxicab. There are a set number of missions available for each type of vehicle; complete them all and you'll be granted some very useful ability bonuses.


Completing the level 12 Firefighter missions makes CJ fireproof.
Completing the level 12 Paramedic missions gives CJ the maximum possible health.
Completing the level 12 Vigilante missions increases CJ's maximum body armor rating to 150%.
Completing the level 12 Taxi missions allows all taxis to make unlimited jumps and nitrous boosts.

, Like most GTA games, San Andreas is chock-full of hidden items, scattered all across the state. If you manage to find all of a certain type of item, you'll be rewarded with multiple weapon spawn points, as well as money in some cases.


Tags are graffiti tag spots that CJ can mark with the Grove Street Families tag. Tag all 100 tag spots to unlock several weapon spawns at his house on Grove Street.
Horseshoes are just what they sound like. Collect all 50 of them to give CJ a much higher chance of winning when gambling, and spawn some powerful weapons at the Four Dragons Casino.
Snapshots are photo opportunities scattered around the city of San Fierro and nowhere else. Snap all 50 of them to earn a bit over $100,000 and some new weapon drops at the Doherty Garage.

, As long as you have garage space (more space can be acquired by purchasing additional properties), you can store vehicles for later use. At times, especially useful and/or hard-to-find vehicles will be available to snag and store. Having these special vehicles can make difficult later missions significantly easier.


Look for armored vehicles. The most obvious of these is the Rhino armored tank, which can be carjacked from Area 69 and stored in a garage for later use. Getting the Rhino home isn't exactly easy, but if you can manage it, once it's in your garage you can keep it.
“Mission jack” super vehicles. There are many amazingly durable vehicles you can only use during missions. By failing these missions (usually by killing the mission boss or destroying the wrong vehicle), you'll be left with a locked version of the super car. You can push or drag the dead car into a garage to restore its functionality.
Grab a Monster. The appropriately named monster truck of GTA San Andreas has ludicrously high clearance, and can simply drive over the top of most other cars, making it useful in some races and chase missions. Its excellent suspension and high clearance also make it ideal for off-road endeavors. You can sometimes find one at a spawn point in the trailer park near the Flint Intersection in Flint County.
Save a tow truck. Having a tow truck on hand will allow you to mission jack many special vehicles by dragging the car back to a garage after you fail the mission. It's also useful for returning destroyed vehicles you'd previously stored back to their garage spaces, restoring them once again.

, There are many missions you have to approach one way only, but there are many you can be creative with, as well. Don't hesitate to take a helicopter to a shootout mission and land on a nearby roof to snipe enemies, or defeat a barricade by accelerating a heavy car to ramming speed and then jumping out of it as it hurtles forward, snagging a smaller and faster car to follow through once the blockade has been destroyed.


If you can't make things work one way, keep retrying the mission from different angles, and with different weapons and vehicles. Never give up, and you'll eventually find a way to pass the mission.

, You'll have an easier time finding the icons if you go at night. Between the times 00:00 and 05:00 in-game, a bright glow will appear around the snapshot icons, making it much easier to pick them out against the dark background.

, For an easier time, find a map of all the snapshot locations. Load the map on your phone or print it out so that you can easily reference it while playing the game..

Once the two of you come to a full stop, approach the car and pull the thief out of your car to get it back.

The time of day doesn’t matter, so try visiting one of the locations below:


Globe Oil Gas Station, Cypress Flats (north of the Ammu-nation), Little Seoul (near the Asian strip mall), Little Seoul (outside the Lucky Plucker), Paleto Bay Market, San Andreas Ave, the man-made canals in the center of Los Santos, El Rancho Blvd., and the Del Perro ramp.
The security vans will appear as a light blue dot on the minimap when you drive by these areas. Now, depending on whether the van’s is parked or on the move, you can either kill its guards or take down its back door, respectively.;
, If the van is parked, you’re in luck as this is the easiest way to get the money since can just rob it before the guards drive away. If it’s on the move, proceed to the next step.


Approach the two guards and gun them down (aim using the L2 button (PS3), LT button (Xbox 360), or Right click (PC); and shoot using R2 button (PS3), RT button (Xbox 360), or Left click (PC).
The guards are armed, so be sure to take them out as quickly as possible. Once you have killed the two guards, one of them will drop a briefcase and you will get a level-two wanted level.

, This method of getting money is arguably more difficult, as it involves accurate shooting while driving. If you encounter a security van while on the highway, get directly behind it. The vehicle is bulletproof and can take quite a few hits before the back doors open.


You can shoot while driving by holding down the L1 button (PS3), LB button (Xbox 360), or left click (PC). Try to aim at the back tires of the truck if you want to force the driver to pull over, or simply shoot at the doors and they will eventually swing open, causing the money to fall out.
Shooting at a moving security van will automatically yield you a wanted level of two stars, so be wary of nearby police attempting to stop you.

, After your vehicle has reached a stop, exit it and look on your minimap for the bright blue dot, which represents the location of the brief case. Walk over it to pick it up.

, Once you’ve successfully killed the van’s guards or open its back door, you’ll find a blue dot on your mini map; this is the money briefcase. Simply approach the dot and walk over the briefcase to pick it up.

, The police will be there soon, so re-enter the vehicle you were driving before and get away. Get in your vehicle (Triangle button for PS3, Y button for Xbox 360, or F key for PC) and scram. You can accelerate by holding down the R2 button (PS3), RT button (Xbox 360), or W key (PC), and steer by using the toggle stick (PS3 and Xbox 360), or directional arrow keys (PC).

, The police will register on your minimap as red and blue flashing dots. Their field of vision is displayed as a blue triangle in front of their vehicles. If you enter an officer’s field of vision while being pursued and continue to flee, another star will be added to your wanted level, making it harder to escape.

, Keep an eye on your minimap, and avoid the police at all costs. Make sure to take back roads and drive through the mountains whenever possible. Once you have successfully escaped the police, the stars in the top right-hand corner of the screen will disappear.

, There are eight tennis courts in Los Santos for you to choose from:


West Eclipse Boulevard – Michael’s Mansion
Dorset Drive – Weazel Courts
West Eclipse Boulevard – Richman Hotel Courts
Great Ocean Highway – Chumash Hotel courts
Palomino Avenue – Vespucci Apartment Courts
Vespucci Beach – Vespucci Courts

Picture Perfect Drive – USLA Campus Courts

, You have the option of picking one game, one set, three sets and five sets. Picking a game is the shortest option, where you only need to score six points against your opponent to complete the match. You’ll need to score seven points if your opponent manages to get at least five points on you. One set means winning at least six games, three sets involves winning at least 18 games and five sets means you need to win at least 30 games.

, Start off with easy to familiarize yourself with the controls, then move on to normal or difficult for greater challenges. You’ll be able to duke it out with one of four AI opponents when playing in single-player mode:


Donato
Norman
Rae
Amanda De Santa – she’ll be your opponent in Michael’s mansion or when she’s accompanying her husband Michael.

, Aim for the middle section of the bar for a nice balance between speed and control. If you want a fast shot with the most force behind it, aim to serve when the bar hits the red area. Use your analog stick or mouse to aim where the ball will go.

, Circular markers on your side of the court will indicate where the ball will land. Get near or behind these circles in order to intercept the ball, and strike it in a way that your opponent will have difficulty returning it back to you.


Base Swing – This is the default return that is useful for returning most shots. It is the easiest to consistently hit for the beginning tennis player.
Lob Shot – Launch your ball high in the air to catch opponents unawares. This can force them toward a particular side of their court and give yourself time to re-position yourself accordingly.
Top Spin – A fast, high-bounce ball to take advantage of opponents that are far away from the side of the court opposite yours. Available when the marker turns red.
Back Spin – A slow, low-bounce shot that has a tendency to make it difficult for your opponents to return balls the way they want to – sometimes resulting in them hitting them the net with the ball instead of returning it to your side of the court. Available when the marker turns yellow.

, Switch up your shots, return the ball so it hits the opposite sides of the court, and you will eventually score a point as you force your opponent to fumble. Harder opponents will do this to you in turn though, so keep your eye on the ball and note where your opponent will most likely aim his or her shot.

A green F will appear on the world map, right above Franklin’s home. To begin the mission, simply head over to the green F icon.


Hood Safari begins at Franklin’s house; a cutscene ensues between Lamar, Denise, and Franklin. Trevor appears, and declares that he wants to join Franklin and Lamar on their drug deal.;
, Once the cutscene has ended, drive to the mission checkpoint. There will be a yellow path on your mini map that will guide you to Grove Street.


Once you arrive at the destination, a cutscene will begin. Lamar will interact with the dealer and sample the drugs. Right before the transaction is made, Trevor insists to see the back of the bag. A brief struggle between Trevor and the dealer ensues, revealing that the back of the package to be drywall.

Enter the vehicle that you want to customize.,
Pause the game and locate a Los Santos Customs or Beeker’s Garage on the map.,
Approach a garage and drive in when the doors raise.,
Select the categories of modifications you want to make, then click on the modifications to purchase them.",How to Modify Cars in GTA V," Since customizing a vehicle can be pricey, consider customizing the characters’ personal vehicles. Even when they are left behind or destroyed, they will respawn at the characters’ residences with their upgrades still intact.


Service vehicles such as police cars cannot be customized. The same goes for planes, helicopters, boats, semi-trucks, and security vans.
Vehicles with the most unique (even bizarre) potential modifications include the Karin Rebel, Bravado Rat-Loader, Vapid Sandking XL, and Trevor’s Canis Bodhi. For instance, the Karin Rebel can be modified to remove most of the vehicle’s body, leaving only the frame.
When playing Grand Theft Auto Online, other players will likely leave you alone in Freemode (instead of opting to attack you) if you have an expensive vehicle, such as the Truffade Z-Type, since it implies you must also have expensive weapons.;
, These locations are marked by cans of spray paint. Click the location on the map to a waypoint to the garage if you’d like to have GPS guidance to the garage.There is no functional difference between Los Santos Customs and Beeker’s Garage. The same services are offered for the same price at both garages.

, If your vehicle is damaged before you enter the garage, you will be forced to pay for repairs before you can make any modifications. The amount you pay for repairs depends on the severity of the damage and the model of the vehicle. Light damage to a high-quality vehicle (such as the Truffade Adder) will cost about $300 to repair.

, The categories include “Transmission,” “Turbo,” and “Brakes.” Some of these categories are further divided into subcategories. For instance, when respraying a vehicle, possible subcategories include “Primary Color,” “Secondary Color,” “Metallic,” “Matte,” “Pearlescent,” etc. Scroll over the various options until you find what you most prefer, then select it.For improved gameplay, you can purchase turbocharging (for faster speed and acceleration), armor and bulletproof tires.
Performance enhancing upgrades will show their effectiveness on the ratings bars underneath the list of customization bars. The ratings bars are labeled “Top Speed,” “Acceleration,” “Braking,” and “Traction.”
Visual upgrades will be reflected in the car model, but won’t be applied permanently until you actually buy them.
Upgrading a car to its peak performance should be expected to cost at least $200,000, depending on the player’s aesthetic preferences. New vehicles and some modifications like new chrome rims are available during in-game flash sales for a reduced price.
Bear in mind that all sales are final, and you can’t resell your vehicle.

Travel to the Ammu-Nation in La Mesa.,
Follow the woman up the stairs and into the alley.,
Kill the attackers.",How to Save Yourself in the Alley in GTA V," It appears on your map as a gun icon. The alley in which this event takes place is directly east of the Ammu-Nation.If this event is available and has been triggered, your minimap will flash. A blue dot will also appear on your minimap, which signifies that someone nearby needs your help.


Unequip any weapons before approaching the woman. She will not ask for your help if you have a weapon equipped.;
, Keep your distance from her as she leads you into the alley. A man will appear from behind the corner of the building, and the two of them will draw their pistols and start shooting at you.


If you don’t keep your distance from the attackers, they will steal $500 from you. It is still possible to retrieve the money they stole after killing them, however.If one of them steals from you, they will stop attacking you and take off running. If you do not shoot and kill them before they run away out-of-sight, you will not be able to retrieve your stolen money.

, It is best to use a gun with good range, such as a submachine gun. Using a close-range weapon, such as a sawed-off shotgun, may require you to stand too close to the attackers and risk being robbed. Once you successfully kill both attackers, the random event will be complete and you can walk up to them to retrieve their dropped ammo and the money they may have stolen.


You have the option to flee from them instead. Doing so will complete the event, but you lose out on the ammo they drop.
If you do decide to flee instead, wait for the second attacker to appear before you run away. They will not pursue you once you leave the alley.

Go to your next tee or to your ball.,
Complete the game.",How to Play Golf in GTA V," The only golf course in the game is the Los Santos Golf Club located in the Richman District. To get there, take Route 18 from Vinewood (center of the map) and head west. Keep driving for a few miles and you should see the golf course on the left side of the road.;
, Park your car and enter through the front entrance of the course. A menu window will appear on the top left corner of the game screen. Press the “Select” button to choose “Start Game” to begin.


Playing golf costs $100. After paying for the fee, your character will immediately change to his golfing outfit and will be given his own golf cart.

, Drive your golf cart to your first tee marked with a blue icon on the map at the lower right corner of your game screen. Once you get to the tee, get off your car and approach the golf ball you see on the ground. Your character will now get into position.

, Press the “Aim” button and move it from left to right to adjust it to your desired position. Proper aim allows you to shoot the golf ball to the right hole.


Because GTA 5 can be played on PC, PS3/4, and Xbox, the player control varies from one platform to another. Don’t worry, though. A prompt will show on the game screen telling you which button of your controller was set to “Aim,” “Swing,” or “Shot,” so you’d know which one to press.

, Once you’ve set the right aim, press the “Swing” button and your character will start swinging his golf club. An intensity bar will also appear right beside your character, letting you gauge the strength of the swing.


You’ll see a yellow dot on the intensity bar as your character swings. This yellow dot points out the right strength of swing you need to use for that particular shot you’re making. The closer the intensity bar is filled to the yellow point, the better shot you’re going to make.

, Once the intensity bar is filled to your desired strength, press the “Shot” button and your character will strike the golf ball, sending it shooting up towards the direction you aimed for.


The camera view will also change to focus on the ball so you can watch it as it travels through the air or grass.

, If you didn’t get the ball into the hole, approach it (walk or drive to it), and repeat steps 4 to 6 to take your shot again, until you shoot the ball into the hole.


If you did get your ball holed the first time, drive to your next tee and repeat steps 4 to 6 to take the new shot. Repeat these steps until you’ve played to your ninth hole.

, After your ninth hole, a score card will appear on the screen showing how well you’ve done in the mini-game. If you want to repeat the same golf course set, simply press the “Replay” button. Otherwise, press the “Continue” button to either start a new set or exit the mini-game.

Finish the game.",How to Play Grand Theft Auto 5 (Story Mode)," GTA V literally takes you straight to a heated situation when the game begins. The game will then put you through a series of mini instructions how to control your character. This includes the usual movements such as walking, running, aiming, shooting, and other basic stuff you’d probably know already if you have played previous GTA titles.;
, One of the most unique additions to GTA V is the Character Switch feature. This feature enables you to switch from one active character to another in real time. Since GTA V has 3 protagonists (Franklin, Trevor, and Michael), this feature makes a lot of sense. It surely adds a new flavor on how you handle missions especially those that includes coordination with all 3 characters.

, The 3 protagonists in GTA V have all unique personalities. Not only that, they also have different abilities that you can use in different cases.


Michael is good with guns. His special ability is activating a “bullet time” effect that slows down everything around you but your shooting speed stays the same.
Franklin has the steadiest hands when it comes to driving. His special ability is somewhat similar to Michael but only while he is driving. This makes him the best driver in the game.
Trevor is the pilot in the group. He can maneuver aircraft with super ease. His special ability is going into “rage” mode. While in rage mode, he inflicts more melee damage and takes less damage from enemies.

, You can visit shops to buy your characters clothes, pants, or shoes. You can even buy them accessories so they can have the look you want them to have. You can also go to barber shops to change their hairdo a bit.


Just like your characters, you can also customize all your owned vehicles such as cars and motorcycles.

, Los Santos is a huge place. It is even bigger than GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption map combined! That being said, familiarizing yourself with the map is very crucial to your in-game survival.


Take note of map icons. There are several map icons that will be available on the map. There are icons for mission, special events, shops, and even where your other characters are at while you’re playing. Take note of these icons so you’d know where to go when you need to reach a certain location.
You can also pin a location anywhere in the map and the game will produce the shortest path from your location to your pinned destination. Really comes in handy.

, GTA V has now increased the penalty for road kills or destroying anything while you are in your vehicle. That means that with just a slight mistake of running over a pedestrian – the police will immediately be on you! You will instantly earn a one star wanted level so be careful.


You should also take precautions even outside a vehicle. If a pedestrian sees you doing something inappropriate – police will be contacted immediately. Same as if you do something stupid in front of a police officer.

, Your first mission will be with Franklin. A bit of tutorial will take place while you venture on this first mission. After successfully finishing the mission, you are now free to roam Los Santos and take missions at your own pace.

, The mobile phone feature is back. This feature is important in progressing through the game for it connects you to all your contacts that sometimes give you jobs. The mobile phone also allows you to access the internet which even broadens the scope of what you can do in GTA V.

, As you take on more missions, you will then earn lots of cash. You should learn to spend it wisely if you want to finish missions with higher success rate.


Most of the jobs you will be having are usually dangerous and involves shooting. That being said, you will need to upgrade your weapon once in a while. You can buy weapons and other combat related stuff from Ammu-Nation.
You should also need to upgrade your vehicles, or at least the one you always use as a getaway vehicle. I can’t stress enough how many police chases you will encounter in GTA V so it is in your best interest that you get yourself a dependable vehicle.

, Since you have 3 characters, missions are well distributed among these 3 characters. There’ll be times that you will run out of event missions. If that happens, that is the time to switch on to another character. By doing this, you will never run out of things to do.


The 3 characters follow a color scheme. Michael is Blue, Trevor is Orange, and Franklin is Green. This means that on the map, missions with orange icons belongs to Trevor and if you approach that icon while you’re using Franklin or Michael, that mission will not trigger.

, To get the most of GTA V, it is advisable for you to take all the missions available before you take on the main story missions. These side missions will not only improve your characters’ stats, they are also rich in story and full of deep personalities. If you are planning to finish the game in 100%, this is the way to go.

, After you have taken all the small jobs and finished the side missions – you are now ready to complete the game once and for all. You can do this by taking main story missions only if you are sure that no other missions are present on all 3 characters.

, On the last few story missions, you will notice that the tasks are getting harder and harder. This is the time that you unleash all the experience you have learned throughout the game.

, GTA V enables players to save anytime as long as you are not currently engaged in a mission. Since the final missions are really hard – make it a habit to save. You can choose to save to a separate slot so you can have different save states stored into your hard drive.


GTA V also has an auto-save feature so don’t worry if you forgot to save and failed a mission.

, All good things must come to an end. Same thing applies with GTA V as you finish your last mission. It will not be a walk in the park and it will even test your decision-making. Well, without spiking anything, let’s just say that after you complete the final mission – you will surely agree that GTA V is one of the best games out there.


After officially finishing the game, you can still roam around and look for easter eggs that are scattered in GTA V. The most popular ones are locating UFO’s and hunting down Bigfoot, or you can even explore the FIB Building! Go ahead, grab some heat, and have fun!

You will be driving a Sanchez dirt bike for this race.
Use Franklin’s special ability during the sharp turns, which are indicated by three arrows on the checkpoints.
Of the 24 checkpoints, the sharpest turns are at the sixth and eighth checkpoints.It is also helpful to use the handbrake while taking sharp turns.;
, For this race, you will be driving a Patriot. There are 16 checkpoints, and the sharpest turns are located at checkpoints two, five, and six. Utilize Franklin’s ability and drift around those turns (by using your handbrake) to gain the advantage against your opponents.

, This race only takes place between 8pm and 3am.You’ll drive an ATV through the 32 checkpoints. There aren’t many sharp turns for this race, but there are many forks which can lead you astray, so you will need to pay attention to the navigation on your radar.

, This race is almost the same as the first race, but backwards. The trail is slightly different and has 22 checkpoints instead of 24. There is a very narrow area which can be difficult to squeeze your ATV through, but it can be made much easier by using Franklin’s ability.

, This 23-checkpoint race does not have any sharp turns, but there are a couple of obstacles to watch out for. At the fifth checkpoint, you will be in mid-air after driving up a ramp. Since you’ll be in a Sanchez dirt bike, you will need to make sure you stick the landing. In between the seventh and eighth checkpoints, use Franklin’s ability to avoid hitting the telephone pole.

Get ready to land.,Start off the lesson while in the air.,
Descend and slow yourself down to a safe speed.,
Align with the runway.,
Aim for the checkpoints.",How to Learn to Fly in GTA V2," Landing is one of the trickiest parts of flying an aircraft, whether it's games, simulators, or real life. It’s also probably the most exciting part of flying. A pilot’s skill is almost always judged by his/her ability to land the aircraft smoothly.,, Be careful not to stall, but make sure you're going slowly enough that you won't crash into the runway. Pitch down slightly to descend. Note that this is unrealistic, as in real life you should never go in negative pitch., Then slowly level yourself with the horizon and allow the plane to gently brush the runway asphalt. Decelerate to gain control, and then taxi till the end of runway to the checkpoint., If you want to earn Gold, try to land the plane further down the runway so you don’t have to cover too much distance to reach the checkpoint. Once you are through the checkpoint, use the ailerons to exit the runway to the left to pass through the second checkpoint."

When you have control, you will be on the runway. Perform a take-off and climb to reach the first marker., Shortly after you reach the marker, a roll meter will appear. Start rolling immediately when it does, by fully turning your left analog stick to the left or to the right until you complete a 360 barrel roll. Then level your plane. The quicker you level your aircraft, the faster the next roll meter will appear.,, Once done, quickly level up again. You will now be asked to fly upside down. Roll upside down – you’ll notice your plane is dipping towards terra firma, so what you need to do is press your left analog stick up.

Yes, up. This is because when you are upside down the Y-axis is reversed. Keep yourself in that position till the meter fills red, while gently holding the left analog stick up to prevent yourself from dipping and losing altitude quickly.

So if you had turned to the right, you will need to have the rudder to the left to keep your plane at the required altitude. Hold the knife till the meter fills red, and then level off the plane with the horizon as quickly as possible.

, You will be using the opposite rudder. Let the meter fill and then quickly level., If you were quick with your knifing and leveling, you should be able to get a Gold on this one."
"
Step up your game for flat hatting.,
Let yourself be guided by the rings that make up the course.,
Don't go too high.,
Be careful with rings number 13, 14, and 15 as they are located above a structurally busy region with poles and tall obstacles.,
Finish up.",How to Learn to Fly in GTA V5," Okay, it’s time to put all that you have learnt to the test. Try flying freely for a while to gain experience and improve your character’s Flying Attribute before you go into this lesson.

Basically, this lesson is a short route that involves takeoff, low altitude flying, sharp banking, and then finally landing. It is a complete course that requires careful handling. If your character is inexperienced in flying, he will have difficulty in controlling the aircraft due to turbulence.

,

Don’t stress yourself by trying to fly directly through them – they have a radius of effect that extends beyond their outer parameter, so it’s okay even if you aren’t exactly aligned.
There are certain sharp turns between ring number 8 to 11, 12 to 13, 15 to 16, and 17 to 18. Use a combination of aileron banking and rudder yaw, while pitching up slightly every time you bank to maintain your altitude.

, There is no reason to fly above the altitude of the rings, but if you do fly with the rings, you need to make sure you don’t lose altitude or you might crash into terrain., The turn between rings 15 and 16 is the most difficult turn, and you will like get very close to the water as you perform a knife. Make sure to use your rudder pedal. Turn between 17 and 18 is also fairly challenging and will require similar maneuvers., You don’t need to land the plane, so hopefully you can breathe a sigh of relief when you are done. If you chipped in a few hours of random flying out of the school before this lesson, you will have better control and hence higher chances of a Gold rating."
"
Start the mission in the air.,
Keep your plane level and fly through the first checkpoint.,Make sure you land on the meat of the bridge and not the sides, otherwise your wing will crash into one of the poles.,
Keep going until you are near the final checkpoint, and then stop right on the check point to make sure you are closer than 10 feet (3.0 m) of it.",How to Learn to Fly in GTA V6," This is an emergency landing on a bridge. The closer you land to the final checkpoint, the better your score will be. This is not a timed lesson, so you don’t need to worry about doing it quickly., Once you have done so, reduce the throttle and start your descent. Touch down where the bridge begins, while constantly avoiding traffic.,, As long as you avoid traffic and don’t accidentally come to a fault halt before the final checkpoint, you will get a Gold rating."
"
Prepare for the Loop the Loop.,
Start off in the air.,
Continue pulling the stick until you complete a 360 degree loop and are back in the same position as before, level with the horizon.,
Perform a barrel roll right when half of the loop is completed.,
Try to fly smoothly and quickly.",How to Learn to Fly in GTA V7," By now you should have the hang of the basic controls, including pitch, roll, and yaw. This flight lesson will have you performing a vertical inside loop with the aircraft., Make sure you are level with the horizon at this time. Then, as soon as the loop meter appears above your Gold rating time, pull back on the left analog stick to increase your pitch., It is important that you pull back vertically and your stick doesn’t slip slightly sideways, otherwise you’ll roll into a spiral. Perform the second loop once its meter appears. This is quite similar to the first., You would end up upside down at the horizon if you were to complete the loop.

However, you will need to cancel the loop at the half-way point and perform the roll, and then level off. This may need some practicing if you aren’t used to aircraft controls, but that shouldn’t be the case if you’ve made it this far.

, This is a relatively tough lesson because of the final stunt, but hopefully by now you should have enough experience to nullify aircraft instability, allowing you to focus on the maneuvers more. A gold rating chance is higher if you can execute the loops fast and level off quickly."
"
Prepare to fly in the helicopter instead of a plane.,
Fly around in a helicopter for some time before jumping into this lesson.,
Start off at the helipad in the airport.,
Move forward by pitching the helicopter down.,
Finish it up.",How to Learn to Fly in GTA V8," Yes, you’ll be flying a course with a chopper this time around. It’s an immediate jump to an aircraft that handles very differently from airplanes, but it’s nothing you won’t be able to handle.

The plus side of a helicopter is that it is slower and doesn’t require a forward thrust to stay in the air, which gives choppers the ability to hover in the air.

, This will help you get used to the slightly different controls and the torque and turning concepts.

The altitude for this course will be reasonably high, but you’ll be flying above the busy central part of South Los Santos and occasionally in between bridge gaps. It’s nothing you shouldn’t be able to handle.

, Just accelerate to raise the chopper. You can use the rudder of the helicopter to turn it on its vertical axis. If you combine the analog stick movement with the rudder, you will get better precision.,

Note that though this is the primary method of increasing the forward velocity of a chopper, it also gradually decreases your altitude. So, it’s important to pull back occasionally and increase the thrust to maintain your average altitude. This is something you should practice prior to participating in the lesson.
There are actually plenty of Under the Bridge challenge bridges that you can come across during this course, but we’ll leave those for later, which you can see in our Under the Bridge Challenge Guide.

, Apart from the fact that you fly a helicopter, this course is much easier than Flat Hatting one with the airplane.

Just remember that in order to achieve a Gold rating, you should try to accelerate between the largely distanced rings, which are 14, 15, and 16. They are in a straight line, so you should have no trouble whatsoever as long as you keep an eye on your altitude.

"
"
Practice a lot with the helicopter.,
Begin in flight.,
Find checkpoint 5.,
Take a sharp turn after the 7th checkpoint.,Make sure you level off properly at the 10th checkpoint to fly smoothly through the next one.,
Make sure you can balance between speed and altitude.,
Find the final checkpoint on the helipad.",How to Learn to Fly in GTA V9," This is another course, except that you have to be very fast in your flight. Hopefully you have gotten the hang of how you can maintain a balance between speed and altitude with a chopper. If not, then practice around before attempting this lesson to ensure a Gold rating., The first four checkpoints have good distance between them and are in a large curve, allowing you to fly fast. They all follow the freeway, so you shouldn’t have any trouble navigating whatsoever., It is located at a higher altitude, so you might need to slow down, gain altitude, and move forward, which will take some time. Try to make this increase in altitude as quick as possible, and then resume your course., After that you should go full throttle and pass the lower altitude checkpoint 8; avoid colliding with the bridge.,, The final set of checkpoints are cramped together and very difficult to maneuver through at fast speed. You might need to halt altogether and make sharp rudder turns at the final two checkpoints., Decelerate quickly (but not so much that you crash downwards) till you land on the mark."
"
Have fun with the sky-diving.,
Start off on the plane.,
Get your distance right.,
Find the target on top of the airport parking garage.,
Make sure you keep the target in sight.,
Lower down and aim at the target with your shoulders till your feet touch it.",How to Learn to Fly in GTA V10," Sky diving doesn’t have much to do with flying an aircraft, but it’s a lot of fun. This lesson will have you sky diving and landing on a specific target. Also, this is not a timed challenge, so don’t have to try to rush things, Leap out of it when prompted, and steer yourself in the air with the left analog stick. Wee!, The rating of this lesson depends on how close you land to the target. You need to land at a maximum distance of three feet from the target to get the Gold rating. Deploy the parachute with the ✕ (PS3) or A (Xbox 360) button. Just do it when you feel the need., After pulling the parachute cord, continue circling around the region while you slowly descend., When you are low enough (around 450 feet), activate precision landing mode by pressing RB and LB (Xbox 360) or . L2 + R2 (PS3). This will slow your descent and allow for precision controlling., This should allow you to land on top or very close to the target, guaranteeing a gold rating."
"
Step up your sky diving game for this challenge.,
Jump off the aircraft and let yourself free fall.,
Activate precision landing once you are around 400 or so feet from the ground, and steering yourself to intersect the path of the truck.,
Take care of your speed when you get close to the truck.,Pat yourself on the back if you manage to land exactly on the target.",How to Learn to Fly in GTA V11," This is another sky diving lesson, but this time around you will be attempting to land on a dynamic target. There is a truck circling the airport runway, and you will have to land on top of it. Note that this is not timed either, but instead gives points for how close you land to the target., You should be able to see the highlight of the truck on the ground even from a high altitude. Allow yourself to freely fall close to the ground, and then pull your chute.,

It is best to fly parallel to the direction of where the truck is handing to make it easier for you to land on the target. Cross landing is very difficult even though the truck is moving slowly.

, Allow yourself to speed up by getting out of precision mode to catch up with the truck if required. If you feel you are going to overshoot, reenter precision mode and slightly pull up, and then resume chasing the truck.,"

Travel to the El Burro Heights area of Los Santos.,
Unequip your weapon, then exit your vehicle and follow the woman.,
Equip a weapon and kill the three gang members.",How to Intimidate the Gang in GTA V," This random event takes place close to the tattoo parlor on the corner of El Rancho Boulevard and Sustancia Road. Once you are there, a blue blip will appear on your radar and you’ll hear a woman cry out for help.If that doesn’t happen, the random event isn’t occurring and you should come back at a later time, or with another character.;
, She is leading you into an ambush, so be prepared to re-equip a weapon. If you are carrying a weapon when you approach her, she will walk away and tell you that she doesn’t need that kind of help. Doing that will cause the random event to become unavailable, but you can come back later or with another character to trigger the event again., They will all be firing pistols, so you may want to take cover. The corner of the house is a good place to take cover. The best choice of weapon is a shotgun, as you’ll be at close range to the gang members. Once they have been eliminated, walk over their bodies to gather their ammo and the money they dropped—anywhere from $500 to $1000.


If you kill the woman as well, you will get a one-star wanted level and will need to outrun the police before the random event will be considered complete.

Work up to your wings.,
Get to know the checkpoints.,
Look out for your third checkpoint.,
Invert as you approach the fifth checkpoint.,
Turn sharply after the tenth checkpoint.,
Look out for the fourteenth checkpoint.,
Finish up.",How to Learn to Fly in GTA V12," So, you’re down to your last lesson. Good job. All that you have learned will be put to test in the final lesson. You will be flying a course that flies you over Los Santos and back to the airport, but you will be performing stunts at certain checkpoints.

Yes; you will be flying around doing while knife and invert maneuvers, so hopefully you have gotten the hang of it by now.

, There are three kinds of checkpoints in this flight.

The Yellow checkpoints are standard checkpoints that will indicate the direction of the next marker.
The Green checkpoints are those that will require you to perform a knife maneuver while passing through them. If you don’t manage to do that, you fail. The center of the checkpoint will indicate whether it’s a left knife maneuver or a right one, but you can do either one – it only shows it as a recommendation to make the following checkpoint easier.
The Blue checkpoints are ones which will require you to fly inverted through them. If you can’t do that, you will fail.

, The challenging part of the lesson starts at the first green checkpoint, which is the third checkpoint overall. You will need to make a hard left knife, which should allow you to take the sharp turn required to go through the fourth checkpoint in a leveled manner., The fifth checkpoint is a blue one, so you will need to quickly invert your aircraft. Level off through checkpoint six, and then perform another knife through the seventh one.

The checkpoint recommends a rightward knife, which is true because the next checkpoint is slightly to the right, but you can still get away with a left knife maneuver as well.

, The left knife through the tenth checkpoint will allow you to make the sharp turn to the next checkpoint easily. You’ll be flying in between the set of buildings now., The next difficult challenge comes with the fourteenth checkpoint, which will require a left knife and a hard turn to checkpoint fifteen. The rest of the checkpoints aren’t as difficult – just make sure you do the maneuvers properly., The last checkpoint is the finish line and you won’t need to land the aircraft. Congratulations, you just finished your final lesson!"

Drive to Mount Haan Road in the Grand Senora Desert.,
Kill the attackers.,
Collect your rewards.",How to Kill the Redneck Border Patrol in GTA V1," It is a dirt road located north of the Vinewood sign and south of the Redwood Lights Track.If the random event has been triggered, three red blips will appear on your radar as the rednecks start following and attacking you with sawed-off shotguns.;
, Two of them will be driving dirt bikes and one will be on an ATV, making them easier to shoot. If you’re playing as Franklin, you can activate your special ability to slow down time and shoot them while driving to perform a drive-by.


Shooting from within your vehicle is your safest choice, as there is no available cover nearby. Your car cannot be reliably used as cover because they will be flanking you.
Running over them in your vehicle will also kill them, but it will likely take longer to kill them all that way.
It is possible to run away to end this random event, but it will not be considered complete., Walk over to them to pick up the ammo and cash they dropped. They will have dropped $600-$700.

Play as Franklin and fill his special ability bar.,
Drive to the construction site in Little Seoul.,
Drive toward the construction worker to trigger the cutscene.,
Run quickly to the Dozer to the left of the construction worker and enter it.There is a gas trail leaking from the worker’s vehicle, and it is travelling toward a generator.,
Use the Dozer to move the metal pipes.",How to Help the Victim of a Construction Accident in GTA V," Franklin’s high-level driving skill and related special ability will be beneficial for this random event. His special ability bar can be filled by driving at over 90% of a vehicle’s maximum speed, driving toward oncoming traffic, driving at high speeds and barely avoiding accidents, as well as drifting (driving fast and using the handbrake while turning corners).This random event is timed, so Franklin’s special ability of slowing time while driving makes this random event easier to complete.;
, It is located one block east of the Ammu-Nation.Once you’re at the construction site, a blue blip will show up on your radar if the random event is occurring. It represents the location of the construction worker.

, Several large metal pipes will fall onto the worker’s vehicle, trapping him inside. Once the cutscene is over, you will have 60 seconds to rescue him.

, If you fail to rescue him in time, the trail will ignite and his vehicle will explode. You will not be harmed by the explosion from inside the bulldozer, however.

, When you’re inside the Dozer, drive diagonally left toward the metal pipes on the driver’s side of the construction worker’s vehicle. Lower the scoop to ensure you push against the entire stack of pipes. Once you push the pipes out of the way, the construction worker will exit the vehicle. As long as he has time to run away from the vehicle before the gas trail ignites, two points will be added to your driving skill.


If you need extra time to perform this task, activate Franklin’s special ability.
Though you can push the pipes away from either side of the vehicle, the pipes on the passenger side are harder to get to and will likely take longer to move.

Complete the story mode.,
Play the Multi-Target Assassination.,
Sell Fruit after the Bus Assassination.,
Complete the fourth assassination, then invest in Vapid.,
Invest in GoldCoast for your final push.,
Keep playing the stock market (optional).,
Delete patches if you're willing to risk it.,
Switch between two characters and pick up infinite cash.,
Sell infinite motorcycles.",How to Have Infinite Money in Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA V)," All of the assassination missions are completed by Franklin, and given to him by Lester.Because your targets are corporations or their competitors, the stock prices rise and fall dramatically because of your assassinations. You can use this to your advantage.


Never complete the next mission in the sequence until all your stock shenanigans are finished.;
, The Hotel Assassination is part of the story mode, so it usually needs to be done before you have much money to invest. Save the rest of the assassination missions until after you've got more money from the story mode.While the profit you make won't make much difference in the long run, you can take the opportunity to practice the technique:Save the game (just to be safe), then invest all your money in Beta Pharmaceuticals on BAWSAQ.
Complete the mission, then sell Beta stock immediately.
Wait for three in-game days, then purchase Bilkington on LCN. (You can make time pass faster by sleeping at your home.)
Wait at least a week, then sell Bilkington.

, It takes money to make money on the stock market. Finish the story mode to get roughly $25 million dollars per character, then continue with the steps below to transform that paltry sum into mountains of cash.

, Now that you have serious bucks to spend, you can invest it into ever-increasing stacks of money. This isn't infinite, but it's as close as you can get in GTA V. Here's the strategy for this second assassination mission:Buy Debonaire stock on LCN.
Complete the mission, sell Debonaire, and purchase Redwood on LCN.
Wait two in-game days, then sell Redwood.

, This one is simple: buy Fruit stock on the BAWSAQ exchange, assassinate the target, then sell Fruit stock right afterward. You can make some extra cash if you then invest in Façade, but that can take some resting and obsessive stock-market checking while you wait for it to rebound. Sell Façade at about 30% higher than the price you bought it at., The Bus Assassination doesn't get you any profit until after you're finished with it. Buy Vapid stock on BAWSAQ right away once you've finished, then wait two days before selling it.

, Your fortune should now be measured in the billions. Invest all of it into GoldCoast before completing the fifth and final assassination. Sell all your stock immediately afterward for a final 80% profit., You're done with the straightforward instructions at this point. Now that you have a fortune to play with, stock market trading can be effectively a source of infinite wealth – or crushing disaster if you're foolish. Always save before a big investments, and follow these tricks:


Buy a large amount of the same cheap stock, then save immediately. Stay on the ""purchase stock"" page so the price keeps updating. If it ticks up by any amount, sell all your stock, save, and repeat. If it ticks down, reload.Get stock tips from the in-game radio, or by investing in Tinkle and using Michael to pick up a passenger at Hitch Lift 1.Trade stock tips with other players at sites like /r/GTAMArket and /r/GTAVstocks.

, These exploits have been caught by the game developers, and no longer work if you have all the patches installed. You can delete the patches and get access to the exploits again, but this sometimes deletes your saves in GTA V or other games. If you're willing to risk this, try the following methods:


Xbox 360: Disable the internet connection. Turn off the console, then turn it on again while holding A.Jailbroken PS3s, JTAG Xbox consoles, and consoles that have never been connected to the internet should be able to use these exploits without deleting any files.

Race!",How to Go Jet Skiing in GTA V," If you have not unlocked the sea race feature, which allows you to compete against others in Jet Ski races, your best bet to riding a Jet Ski is finding one in the open world. These Jet Skis are available from the very beginning of the game.

A Seashark Lifeguard model can be found parked in the water at the Del Perro Beach and the Vespucci Beach. Del Perro Beach is located on the left side of the map, and Vespucci is located a bit further down the coast.
Once on the coast of the beach, the Jet Ski docking area can be found located to the left of the pier; it will appear as a dock with several Jet Skis parked in front of it.;
, Swim out to the dock. Press the toggle forward (PS3 and Xbox 360) or directional keys (PC) to enter the water. Once in the water, swim by repeatedly tapping the X button (PS3) A button (Xbox 360) or Q key (PC)., Once adjacent to a Jet Ski, press the Triangle button (PS3), Y button (Xbox 360) or F key (PC) to board the vehicle., While on the Jet Ski, hold down the R2 button (PS3), RT button (Xbox 360) or W key (PC) to accelerate. Steer by using the left stick (PS3 and Xbox 360) or directional keys (PC)., If you want to hone your Jet Ski skills, then consider participating in sea races. Sea races become available to all characters once you have completed the mission “Hood Safari.” This mission occurs after Franklin, Trevor and Michael have completed their first heist together.

The mission begins at Franklin’s house. A cut scene ensues between Lamar, Denise, and Franklin. Trevor appears, and declares that he wants to join Franklin and Lamar on their drug deal.

, Once the cutscene ends, drive to the mission checkpoint. Make sure to wait for Lamar and Franklin to enter the car before you begin driving. To guide you, there will be a yellow path on your minimap that will lead you to the pick-up spot.

Once you arrive at the destination, another cutscene will begin. Lamar will knock on the door, which is answered by a stoic man. The man hands over a white package, which Lamar proceeds to cut with a knife. He snorts the cocaine residue on the knife off the blade and declares it to be legitimate. However, right before the transaction is made, Trevor insists to see the back. A brief struggle between Trevor and the dealer ensues, revealing that the back of the package to be drywall.

, The dealer sends out his men to kill the trio, and a violent shootout begins. Luckily, there will be plenty of cover to hide behind, so despite being outnumbered, you’ll have a fighting chance.

To take cover, press the R1 button (PS3), RB button (Xbox 360), or Q key (PC).
You can identify enemies on your minimap as red dots. To aim at them, hold down the L2 button (PS3), LT button (Xbox 360), or Right click (PC). To fire, press the R2 button (PS3), RT button (XBox 360), or Left Click (PC).
You will know that you have successfully killed a gangster when the crosshairs in the center of your screen flash red, while your surroundings briefly flash black and white.

, After you have killed the gangsters, the LSPD will show up to stop the violence. A checkpoint will appear on your map; follow it. You’ll find yourself running through a narrow alley that will lead to open water.

Once near the water, a cutscene will show 3 Jet Skis being used by a rapper and a few bikini-clad girls. Trevor will throw them off, and everyone will board the Jet Skis.

, Once on the Jet Ski, you will still need to escape the police. Just head out into open water at a steady speed; this will eventually cause them to give up the chase.

Once you have escaped the police, the quest will finish, and sea races will be unlocked.

, Once sea races have been unlocked, there will be a total of four different locations on the map where you can compete. These locations will be marked as white boat icons on the world map. You can race in any type of weather; however, sea races are only available during the day (from 8AM to 9PM).

Open the map by pressing the Start button (PS3 and Xbox 360) or the M key (PC). The four sea race locations are Los Santos Port, Power Station, El Gordo, and Lago Zancudo.
Once you have decided on a race location, move your cursor to hover over its icon while on the map, then press the X button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360), or Left click (PC) to mark it as your destination.

, A purple path will appear on your minimap, follow it to the race location. You will have to swim to where the Jet Ski races have gathered. While in the water, use the left stick (PS3 and Xbox 360) or directional arrow keys (PC) to swim forward. To swim faster repeatedly tap the X button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360) or Q key (PC)., Once at the racing area, you will notice several other racers aboard their Jet Skis. Swim over to an unoccupied Jet Ski, and once near it, an onscreen prompt will appear asking if you wish to participate in the sea race. Select the “Yes” option to board the Jet Ski and begin the race., A countdown will now begin. When it reaches zero, hold down the R2 button (PS3), RT button (Xbox 360) or the W key (PC) to accelerate. You can steer by using the left stick (PS3 and Xbox 360) or directional keys (PC).

The race consists of yellow checkpoints, which appear on your minimap as yellow dots. Race through these checkpoints alongside your competitors. The race will end when you drive through the checkered checkpoint.
Racing in sea races will help you practice driving a Jet Ski (in case you need it to escape from the police again later on), but it really doesn’t give you any points or rewards for winning.

To locate this mission, open up the world map by pressing the Start button (PS3 and Xbox 360) or M key (PC). Once on the map, search for a green F icon in the Mount Chiliad area. Once you have located it with your cursor, press the X button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360), or Left Click (PC) to set it as your destination.;
, You will come across a barking dog. Franklin is able to understand the dog and follows it along a dirt path, where a man is hanging out of a tree, his parachute tangled in the branches.


A brief cut scene begins as Franklin helps the man out of the tree. This man, who introduces himself as Dom, calls his helicopter pilot to come get both him and Franklin.

, When ready, press the on-screen prompt to jump out of the helicopter. While free-falling, you can control the direction you move in by using the toggle sticks (PS3 and Xbox 360), or directional arrow keys (PC).

, When ready to deploy your parachute, press the X button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360), or left click (PC). Although it varies from jump to jump, it is always better to deploy your parachute sooner than later. The optimal time to deploy it would be about seven seconds after free fall.

, The pilot will take you to the appropriate altitude, and your character will be standing at the helicopter’s door. When ready, press the on-screen prompt to jump into the sky.

, Wait around seven seconds from the jump before deploying your chute. This ensures that you’ll have a pretty safe landing.

, There will be a target area for your landing marked on your minimap as a yellow dot. As you get closer to the ground, you will be able to identify this area by the yellow circle. If you manage to land in the target area, you will be rewarded with a monetary prize, which increases the closer you land to the center.

Balance your cash money and bank money.",How to Get More Money on Grand Theft Auto V Online," They earn substantial monetary benefits; the first heist has a total take of around $125,000 (Hard mode) and is relatively easy. Heists become more audacious and challenging, with progress and the rewards will pay better.;
, In-game missions are sent to you automatically as part of the game storyline; to make sure you don't miss these, check your phone for calls and texts regularly. As you get these options, carry them through to earn cash.

, Both being a team player and being greedy and self-centered can have its monetary benefits.


Be a team player, if you pick the ""good"" path. It doesn't pay to be a pain; if you're a friendly and mindful player, you'll sometimes be rewarded with some small cash amounts in your bank account. Work together with other players to benefit from shared good sportsmanship.
Alternatively, put yourself first. Every time a player dies, they drop money by their body, so if you want to be ruthless, you can pick it up and earn this way. Killing for cash often ends up with your earning a bad reputation, though, so do this only with care.

, Holding up these establishments is a good way to earn cash fast. You need to intimidate the cashier in order to fill the ""intimidation bar"" and get the earnings. It's a good idea to have a headset plugged in, since yelling at cashiers both works and attracts less police attention than using a gun.

, There are a variety of one-off activities that can earn you money; look over your map in the game in order to find options like races (on land and water), team death-matches, and other blue icons for this kind of activity.


The way you earn through these activities is by betting. Bet with other players, in multiples of a hundred, and earn the dough if you come in first place.

, If you click on the custom menu for any given car, it gives you the option to sell it. What you get for the car depends on the model and condition; it often helps to repair any damage before trying to sell it.

, Finding other players that you trust is key. Many missions take two or more people, but you want to be sure to partner up only with people who you truly trust, lest they rob you. Team up with players who have your back, be loyal to them, and it'll help you both out.

, The game gives you the option of gifting money to other players. Sometimes, doing this can encourage others to share money back to you - but, honestly, it's a gamble. Most players won't return the favor, so don't count on this for income.

, When you look at your earnings, you'll see both ""Bank"" and ""Cash"" balances. Your Bank money is found in your bank, and you can use ATMs to withdraw more, deposit cash, or check your balance. When you do this, make sure there's nobody on your tail who might rob you.

, The controls for swimming are the same with or without scuba gear, but the gear allows you to stay underwater indefinitely.Near the coast, it’s possible to swim all the way down to the ocean floor; further out, swimming beyond a certain depth is deadly due to extreme water pressure.


Scuba diving is required to complete Michael’s “Murder Mystery” mission if you are playing the enhanced version of the game (for PS4, Xbox One, or PC).
Michael is also required to scuba dive in the mission titled “Monkey Business.”
Any character can scuba dive to find wrecked planes and boats, in which money and weapons can sometimes be found.

If you’re playing as Michael, you can practice swimming in your own backyard. If you’d like to try swimming in a more open area, there are a few open lakes that feed into the rivers.


The Tataviam mountain range has a large body of water in its center, and is located just outside of Los Santos, in the Northeast.
To the north of Los Santos, located in the middle of Vinewood, is another large lake.
Aside from the ocean, the largest body of water is the Alamo Sea, which feeds into several small rivers. The Alamo Sea is located to the west of Sandy Shores.
The world of GTA V is surrounded on all sides by water, so if you continue in one direction for long enough, you’re sure to find the ocean eventually.;
, You can enter the water simply by walking into it. Once the depth passes over your character’s head, they’ll immediately begin treading water.

, To swim forward in the water, use the toggle stick (PS3, Xbox 360) or directional keys (PC). To accelerate your character’s speed, repeatedly tap the X Button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360), or the Shift key (PC).

, If the water is over your character’s head, then you can try diving beneath the surface. Press the R1 button (PS3), RB button (Xbox 360), or Q key (PC) and your character will dive below the surface.


Once under the water, swim using the same controls that you would on the surface.

, While in the water, the only weapon you can use is the knife. In case you need to defend yourself from sharks, you can equip the knife by pressing the L1 button (PS3), LB button (Xbox 360), or Tab key (PC). With the knife equipped, attack by pressing the Circle button (PS3), B button (Xbox 360), or the R key (PC).


You can attack while submerged or while treading water on the surface.

, Because your character is only human, you can’t stay submerged forever. There is a light blue meter in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, next to your character’s health. This indicates how long they can stay underwater. Once the light blue meter runs out, your character will begin to lose health very quickly. If you do not surface before their health runs out, you will die.

, If the health meter is running low, surface quickly. To reach the surface again, simply press the toggle stick/directional arrow key upwards towards the surface of the water. To reach the surface more quickly, tap the X button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360), or Shift key (PC).

Kill the last guard inside the farm.,
Take the briefcase as your reward.",How to Fight the Bandits in a Drug Shootout in GTA V," You will need to take the only road that runs north from Grapeseed. Grapeseed is located in Blaine County, far north of Los Santos and southeast of Mount Chiliad. Once in Grapeseed, there will be a sign on the right side of the road that says “Braddock Farms, Follow Path.” Keep following that road until you reach the farm. When you are near the weed farm, a leaf icon will appear on your minimap to indicate the location.You can check your Pause menu to make sure you’re attempting this random event on a Tuesday. The day appears at the top right corner of the Pause menu.;
, There will be six people guarding the farm, and they will begin attacking you as soon as they’re aware of your presence. One person will be guarding a briefcase inside the building, and the rest will be outside in random locations, attacking with various guns, such as pistols, assault rifles, and small machine guns. You will need to shoot to kill them or use explosives to kill multiple targets at once. Alternatively, you can throw tear gas near the enemies, which will disable them (making them easier to kill) and will kill them automatically if they stay near the gas for too long.


Take cover while attacking to ensure your safety. There are many stacks of wooden pallets on the farm, which you can use for cover. You can also use your car or the building itself as cover.
You can perform stealth attacks by crouching and avoid being detected, then doing a melee attack from behind the target. Crouch behind the stacked wooden pallets or behind another nearby object if you think you may soon be seen by one of the bandits. Once they’re looking in another direction, continue crouching and sneak up behind them to execute them. If multiple bandits are situated closely together, consider a less stealthy approach.
You can use Trevor’s special ability, which will make him nearly invulnerable until his special ability bar depletes. It also increases his damage while doing any kind of attacks (melee or otherwise). The ways in which you can fill his special ability bar during this fight are performing headshots, taking damage, and killing with explosives.
If this is not your first time doing this random event, you can play as another character. If you are playing as Michael, you can use his special ability to slow down time while shooting guns for more accuracy. He will only be able to use this ability until his special ability bar is empty. However, you can refill the bar by allowing his health to dip below 25%, getting headshots, and killing while in stealth mode (crouched and undetected).

, Make your way inside the building, then eliminate the final person guarding the briefcase either through stealth or by shooting him directly.

, The briefcase will be next to the guard you just killed. A random amount of money will be inside the briefcase. Your reward could be anywhere from $4,000 to $100,000.

Go to one of those locations.,
Do yoga.",How to Do Yoga in GTA V," Unfortunately, Michael is the only one of the three characters that can do yoga, and you must complete one of his story missions to unlock the activity. “Did Somebody Say Yoga?” occurs roughly halfway through the game, after completing the mission “Dead Man Walking,” so you’ll have to go through the story as usual until this mission begins.


While you’re at home as Michael, Amanda comes in and a cutscene begins. The two argue for a bit, until Michael finally agrees to try out yoga with his wife. The two then exit into the backyard, followed by Amanda’s instructor, Fabien. Michael will step onto his yoga mat, and a series of QTEs (quick time events) will begin.;
, Button prompts will appear on-screen guiding you to press down on either of the sticks or directional arrows. Apply slight pressure, gradually increasing it as Michael gets into position.


If you press too hard or too quickly, Michael will stumble, and you will have to start the pose over.
There are a total of 3 poses. Once completed, another cutscene will begin, ending with Amanda and Fabien leaving Michael.

, After the cutscene, you’ll be in your car with Jimmy, and you’ll find a new checkpoint on the map. Follow the yellow lines to reach this point. Another cutscene will begin, which features Jimmy picking up drugs from one of the workers.


Jimmy coerces Michael into trying some, which immediately blurs the screen and makes the car impossible to control. Jimmy pushes Michael out of the car. After this, Michael has hallucinations, and dreams that he is dropped mid-air over Los Santos. After this, Michael wakes in his underwear and rushes back home.
The house is empty, with only a note behind from Amanda saying that his family has left him. After this, the mission is complete.

Talk to Maude Eccles as Trevor.,
Find Ralph Ostrowski.,
Find Larry Tupper.,
Find Glenn Scoville.,
Find Curtis Weaver.",How to Do the Bail Bond Mission in GTA V," Her location appears on your map as an orange question mark in Grapeseed, which is east of Trevor’s safehouse in Sandy Shores. After you speak to her, check your phone to find the email she sent you. It will contain the name of the target and a photo of their location.


Capturing targets is easiest with a Stun Gun, though it isn’t required. Trevor can acquire a Stun Gun by completing the first “Abandoned Vehicle” random event. To do this, you must use Trevor’s Rampage special ability to slow down time and kill the person inside the abandoned vehicle before they have time to use the Stun Gun on you. Afterward, you can pick up the Stun Gun and keep it.
The first target, however, is easiest to capture using a sniper rifle. Purchase one from an Ammu-Nation, or if you already have one, equip it once you reach the destination.
If you don’t have a Stun Gun, running into a target or shooting them non-lethally will cause them to surrender.
Having a high-level stamina stat will make it easier to chase after targets on-foot. Running, cycling and swimming increases your stamina.;
, He is located in the David Quartz quarry, which is southeast of Trevor’s safehouse and southwest of Maude’s home. Stay at a distance and zoom in through your sniper rifle scope to identify the target, who is standing next to a black Landstalker. Shooting him in the leg will cause him to surrender. Drive him back to Maude’s home and drop him off, then check your phone for the next email from Maude.


If you catch his attention or fail to shoot him in the leg, he will try to escape by driving away in the Landstalker. This will make it more difficult to get him to surrender, but you can still do so by shooting two of his tires.Try not to shoot at the gas tank, however, since doing so can cause the vehicle to ignite and explode, resulting in his death and a lesser reward.

, Follow the road directly south of the Suburban shop in Sandy Shores (which leads southwest) until you find a barn on a hill. Larry Tupper will be inside the barn, along with friends who will shoot at you when you’re noticed. You can kill all of them if you want, but it’s not necessary. Larry will flee when one of his friends are killed or injured, at which point you should drive to chase him. Gently bump into him with your vehicle to make him surrender (or shoot him with a Stun Gun), then deliver him to Maude and check for the next email.You can exit your vehicle and use it as cover while shooting one of his friends, but get back into your vehicle as soon as you notice that Larry is fleeing.
Check the photo that Maude sent you to make sure you don’t accidentally shoot Larry instead of his friends.

, Take the tram up to the top of Mount Chiliad, then grab the parachute on the tramway station once you arrive.Glenn Scoville will be standing with a friend at the top of the mountain, and will jump off of the edge when you approach him. Jump off as well and follow him while parachuting. Once he eventually lands, land near him and run into him, causing him to surrender. Find a nearby vehicle and take him back to Maude, then check for the final email.


If you have a Stun Gun, activate Trevor’s Rampage ability to slow down time and shoot him with the Stun Gun before he jumps off of the mountain.

, Travel the Great Ocean Highway to the east of Paleto Bay. Look for a tunnel beside the highway, which has a banner above it that reads “Dignity Village!” Go into that tunnel to find the target: he is wearing a hat, a tank top and suspenders. He will flee when he sees you. Either shoot him with a Stun Gun, shoot him in the leg or chase him and run into him. Once he surrenders, drive him back to Maude’s home to receive your payment.


When he runs away, he may run into traffic and be killed.If that happens, you will only receive half of the reward.
Trevor’s Rampage ability is useful here, and it gives you extra time to capture the target.

, If you are caught off guard and the mugger is able to rob you, quickly get up off the ground and chase down the mugger. If the mugger steals your vehicle, you will need to quickly take it back before he has time to drive off.

, Once the mugger has stolen your money and taken your vehicle, he will attempt to get away. If you are not quick enough, he can be gone in seconds. If you aren’t able to get your vehicle back, you will have to steal another to catch up to the mugger.


Shooting the mugger’s tires or blocking his path with another vehicle are both great ways to stop the mugger in his tracks.

, Once you have killed the mugger, simply walk up to him and gather what money he has stolen.


You need to kill the mugger in order to get your money back. If he is able to get away, you will not be able to get it back.

Target them so that your reticule turns red.

,
Hold the right trigger to lunge at them, Press X before you hit them to cancel the attack and do no damage when you hit them.,
To lunge at a target from far away, get a rocket launcher and empty out all of the ammunition.,
An alternative method is to target with the sword and press X, B, then R rapidly.

",How to Sword Cancel in Halo 2,",,, Or you can just press X at the same time you press right trigger.

, Target the person with the rocket launcher, and press Y and the right trigger, do that combo rapidly and then if it don't work just do it again, rapidly doing it will make it more likely to not work. If done properly, the sword will think it is locked on and you will lunge at the target, no matter how far away.


If you have a Xbox or Xbox 360 that has never connected to Xbox Live and updated Halo 2, this will still work. Otherwise Bungie has updated your game and fixed this.

Learn the weapons, starting with the Battle Rifle.,
Work the body until the shield breaks, then hit the head.,
Strafe, or move side-to-side, when shooting.,
Use grenades frequently to deal damage and flush out targets.,
Raise your ""Look Sensitivity"" in the controls to aim faster.,
Learn to look out for the red reticule.",How to Win at Halo 21," Halo has a lot of weapons, and the more you know about them better you will be in any mode. The essential weapon to learn is the battle rifle, which shoots accurate, 3-bullet bursts suitable for a variety of distances. With proper shot placement (the head), it can take down most enemies in a few hits, and the scope greatly increases your range. The Covenant Carbine is a similar weapon, though slightly less common. As you improve, you can move on to other weapons for more specific scenarios:



Pistols are really only useful when duel wielded, or against weak enemies when you want to conserve ammunition.

Rifles, Needlers, SMG are fast-shooting damage dealers used in mid to close range fights. Usually, you need to duel-wield them to be effective.

Sniper Rifles are essential for a good Halo player. They can kill most enemies with a single shot to the head, and are highly accurate.

Shotguns and swords are only good for close-range, quick kills. You need to be very close to the enemy for them to be effective, but they kill quickly.;
, Most enemies in halo, and all of the players online, have a full body shield that must be broken before you can do damage. The shield is always up and regenerates after a few seconds if the player doesn't die. Hitting any part of the body damages the shield, so unless you're sniping you should aim for the biggest target, the chest, until the shield breaks. When it does you'll see a little blue crackle. When the shield is down, a shout above the shoulders will take almost any enemy straight down.


Energy weapons, like the alien arsenal (plasma pistols, rifles, etc.) do extra damage to shields, but less to unshielded enemies.
Bullet weapons, like the battle rifle, do extra damage to unshielded targets. This is why most duel-wielders have one energy and one bullet weapon.

, A moving target is much harder to hit. It is also difficult to aim while strafing if you aren't practiced. When you're in a firefight, especially a one-on-one, keep moving back and forth unpredictably, taking 2-3 steps to one side, then 2-3 to the other. Practice moving your aim simultaneously with your body, allowing you to keep racking up shots while the enemy tries to hit you.


Strafing needs to be side to side – moving forwards and backward barely changes your opponent's target.
Avoid jumping a lot. Once you jump you're in the air, unable to change directions, and a good player will be able to pick you off., You can carry up to 8 grenades in Halo, and you should be using them frequently. Grenades deal massive damage in a small area, and they cause enemies to shuffle out of the way. This can bring them into the open, where it is easy for you to pick them off. You can toss them long distances over cover as well, and 1-2 grenades used in a small are could get you the kill.


Use grenades to start and finish fights -- pulling someone out of cover or getting the kill as they run away.
Don't use grenades in an open space when taking fire. They take 1-2 seconds to throw, and you'll be getting shot at the whole time. Chances are good you'll die before releasing the orb., Look sensitivity determines how quickly your cross-hairs move when you move the control stick. While it can be difficult to adjust to at first, a higher look sensitivity helps you aim and turn much faster, giving you an edge in a fight. Go into Options from the start screen and up the look sensitivity for 1-2 rounds. It will take some getting used to, but it will improve your game with time., If your cross-hairs go red, especially when holding the sniper rifle, pull the trigger. The red reticule means you have an enemy in your sights and they are in an accurate range. With a sniper, this can help you ""smudge"" head shots, which is when the game recognizes the shot once your reticule is red and automatically confers the headshot."

Drive to the corner of Macdonald Street and Strawberry Avenue.,
Wait for Packie and his friend to enter the vehicle.,
Run from the cops to get rid of your wanted level.,
Take them to the location they specify.",How to Deal with the Getaway Driver in GTA V," The Dollar Pills parking lot is where this event takes place. It is a block southeast of Franklin’s first safehouse.Two blue blips will show up on your radar if the random event is available.


Take a four-door vehicle to the location. If you take another type of vehicle, you will be required to find one with four doors.
It is also advisable to take a fast vehicle, as there will be a high-speed police chase. Examples of fast four-door vehicles are the Ubermacht Oracle, the Dewbauchee Exemplar, and the Bravado Buffalo S (which Franklin owns).;
, When you arrive, you will witness their robbery. Afterward, they will ask you to take them away from the scene of the crime, then get into your vehicle. This will cause the cops to come after you, as helping them flee gives you a two to three-star wanted level.

, Find a straight road to drive down as fast as you can without crashing. Your radar will flash red and blue if you are within sight of the police. Once you are out of their line of sight, hide in the nearest alleyway until your wanted level is gone.


When the police can no longer see you, they will appear on your radar as blue cones. The cones represent their line of sight. While you are hiding, try to stay away from the blue cones.
If a police car is approaching you while you are hiding, and it is likely that they will see you soon, drive away fast until you find another alleyway to hide in.

, The location will appear on your radar as a yellow line leading to a yellow dot. Follow the navigation line until you arrive at the destination. Once you drop them off, Packie will give you a $1,000 reward, and he will be unlocked for future heist missions.


If you prefer, you can drop them off at the Altruist Cult instead for $2,000. In order to do this, you must be playing as Trevor. However, this is inadvisable because it will not unlock Packie as a heist accomplice.
After dropping four people to the Altruist Cult, another random event will unlock for Trevor, which results in a gain of $100,000. Dropping Packie and his friend off would make it so that you only have to deliver two more people from random events.
You will not be paid for delivering a fourth person to the cultists, since it triggers the new random event. Therefore, if you have already delivered two or three people to the Altruist Cultists, you will not get a payment for dropping off Packie and his friend.If you don’t want to recruit Packie as a heist accomplice, and don’t want to deliver him and his friend to the cultists, you can kill them and collect the money and ammo they drop. You can gain around $2000 to $3000 by doing this.

Learn the maps, discovering the layout and weapon drop areas.,
Crouch to remove yourself from the radar.,
Run and regroup if you don't have a clear line of sight against an enemy.,
Dual-wield weapons in tight situations and close-quarters combat.,
Stick with your team.,
Hold your ground instead of rushing around.",How to Win at Halo 22," Find out where certain guns are that pack the big punch, like the shotgun, the rocket launcher, and the sword. Gun locations vary on different maps, and you need to know them ahead of time to succeed.


Learn the maps one at a time by yourself by playing against a friend in Local Multiplayer. The better you know the maps, the better the battle will be.
Once you know where everything is, practice with one or two friends., Once you've crouched, you no longer appear as a little red dot to your enemies. This is perfect for a stealthy kill, especially if you're using a shotgun, which needs to be close range, or you're trying to hide out of the way to squeeze off a few sniper shots. Having the element of surprise, especially on smaller maps, will make a big difference., In multiplayer, every death gives the other team a point or takes you off the map, hurting your team. As such, you can't fight every person you see just because they're in front of you. If you know you can only get 1-2 weak hits at an enemy running off, save your grenades and ammo. Similarly, if you're outnumbered or fighting a player with better weapons, more visibility, or the advantage, try and find a way out instead of going down in a blaze of glory. You'll save your team a point and live to fight another day.


Before starting a mid-range or long-range fight, ask yourself if you could get the kill at this distance.
When you're weak, like when your shield breaks down, get behind cover. At the very least, force the opponent to use a grenade instead of giving them the easy kill with their bullets.

, Dual-wielding combos can be an excellent strategy in up close combat, try these weapon combos. However, duel-wielding prevents you from using grenades or items. When possible, resort to duel-wielding in the heat of a fight, then drop a weapon if you're out in the open or need to adjust your game plan.


SMG+ Magnum
SMG+Plasma Rifle
SMG+Plasma Pistol
Magnum + Charged Plasma Pistol (instant kill if both are head shots), Don't be a lone wolf trying to track down your kills on your own -- you will be better as a team. When you've got someone else with you, you can bring down enemies in half the time, making it difficult for them to get any shots off against superior numbers. Just as importantly, traveling with a team prevents you from getting ganged up on, and even if you die you have a teammate who can quickly finish up the kills you started. Keep communicating, letting your team know:


When an enemy has a power weapon like a sword, grenade launcher, sniper, etc.
The locations of the other team or objects (like the flag, bomb, etc.)
When you're using explosives that might hurt teammates.
Where you're going, if you're making a move (like capturing the flag).

, A player who keeps their cool always has the upper hand. Stay out of open terrain or low areas with lots of high vantage points around you. Never chase after someone for a kill, especially if they can see you well in advance or have cover. Stick to cover whenever possible, only leaving when you need to get an item or you know you can get the kill. While most people think about getting as many kills as possible, the best players stay alive as long as possible."

, After completing the third heist, Michael will have access to missions given to him by Solomon Richards. Meltdown is the third mission Michael does for Solomon. After completing the mission, Michael will have access to Solomon’s office, which is where one of the murder mystery clues can be found., It is located in West Vinewood, two blocks west of the Oriental Theater. Walk between the five buildings and toward the building to the southwest. The message will be scratched into the wall to the right of the window. This message reads “Old Fred acts nice but it ain’t so!”


Each time you find a clue, including the messages, an autosave icon will appear in the bottom right of your screen to indicate that you’ve successfully found the clue.
You can find the messages in any order.

, Go to the northwest corner of the theater. The message can be found on a wall to the left of a palm tree and to the right of a movie poster.


The message alludes to a clue you will find later: “Ain’t no mystery. They drowned her because of what she knew!”

, It is in the Alta neighborhood of Vinewood, two blocks east of a Ponsonbys store. The message is located in an alcove near the southwest corner of the building, below a light. The message you find here is “Fred makes cartoons for kids, funny thing considering what he hid.”

, Make your way down to the lowest level on the southwest section of the building. It is on a wall facing downtown Los Santos. This message reads “David Richards knows.” Solomon Richards is the son of David Richards.


You will need to find all four messages before finding the next clues.

, The next clue can only be found by scuba diving. When you exit a dinghy or submersible into a body of water, you will automatically be equipped with scuba diving gear. Since you completed the Meltdown mission, and therefore completed the second heist, a submersible can be found at Trevor’s airfield. However, you will need to transport it by latching it onto a Cargobob helicopter.


If you prefer to take a dinghy, they can be found near the docks on the southern coast of Los Santos.

, Drive the dinghy or submersible out to the west of Fort Zancudo. Exit the vehicle to equip scuba gear, then explore the ocean floor in this area. You will find the corpse of a woman whose head is covered with a bag, and her feet are encased in cement. Swim back to the surface and head back into the city.

, After 9PM, there will be a yellow mission marker outside of Solomon’s office in the Richards Majestic building.Go into his office and read the letter on the desk. The letter will give you more insight into the mystery and will lead you to where another corpse was hidden.

, You will need to purchase a flashlight attachment for one of your weapons. Having a flashlight is required to find the corpse, and this Ammu-Nation is closest to the corpse’s location.

, You can get there by following a road going south from the Ammu-Nation in Grand Chaparral. When the road forks, take the left road, and the mine will be located at the first large curve of that road. Use an explosive or shoot down the doors of the mine. Equip your weapon with a flashlight attachment and travel into the mine until you find the corpse. Once you do, you will gain a new contact in your phone. Calling that number will unlock two new vintage filters you can use for your phone’s camera.


You don’t have to use your phone’s camera to see the filters, as they will be applied to normal gameplay as well.
By calling the contact, one of the two filters will be applied. When you call again, the next filter will be applied. Calling the contact a third time will disable the filters."

, You aren’t going to catch the thief on foot. Quickly locate a vehicle nearest to you. You can find a vehicle on the nearest street or even a parking lot close by. Regardless, find a vehicle and get to it quick!


Parked cars are usually locked. This can slow you down as you’ll need to unlock the vehicle first.
Cars located on the street that are currently being driven are unlocked and easy to take.

, Stealing your newfound vehicle may seem like an easy task, but it can end up costing you crucial time you could be using to chase the bike thief.

",How to Play Grand Theft Auto 5 Online," The manner of creating your own character in GTA V is different from the usual process of character creation. It is not simply customizing your character’s height, color, or looks. In this game, character creation is divided into three parts. Heritage, Lifestyle, and Appearance.;
, GTA V lets you choose four grandparents that will affect how your parents will look. These generated parents will then define what your character will look like. This makes sense, since it simulates the natural method of how our physical appearance is affected by our roots. You can also adjust the degree of your resemblance to your parents.

, You’ll be asked to distribute points to different activities that will influence your character’s in-game abilities (such as stamina, strength, and shooting skills). This process still slightly affects your physical appearance. For example, putting a lot of points into your ""Sitting on the Couch"" attribute will quickly make your character overweight.

, Set your age, hair type, hair color, and other details of your character. Make sure you make your character unique because this character will represent you online. When you are satisfied with how your character looks, choose ""Save & Continue"".

, Give your character a name and get ready to dive into the online world of GTA V!

, Your adventure begins when you arrive at the Los Santos Airport. Lamar (from GTA V story mode) picks you up and your tutorial missions begin. Lamar will immediately introduce you to some GTA V missions that you can play online.

, Or not. Keep in mind that these tutorial missions are actual multiplayer sessions with other online players. This is a good chance for you to get a feel of what is in store for you after the lengthy tutorial.

, Since the tutorial missions are actual multiplayer matches, you will be rewarded with actual Reputation Points (RP) and money right after every successful tutorial mission. RP is very important since it determines your ranking online. Money or cash will allow you to buy yourself weapons, vehicles, and any other important stuff online.

, Right after finishing the tutorial missions, you are now free to roam around and further explore Los Santos and Blaine County. Check out the map to learn the basic regions. The mini–map will also make your life easier, since it shows map icons that correspond to different locations in Los Santos and Blaine County.

, Drive around and start getting acquainted with the fastest routes to places and the smaller details of the neighborhoods. This will help you learn your way around even more, so that you don't have to check the map as often.

, You can start raising your RP (Reputation Points) and cash by joining online matches and accepting missions. Your RP determines your online ranking in GTA V, so if you want to rank-up fast, you better gain lots of RP. You can check out your map to see where to go to join in online matches or get missions.

, There are several multiplayer game modes such as Deathmatch, Race, Free Mode, and others that you can compete on to receive rewards. These multiplayer matches sometimes involve co-op but most of the time it’s every man for himself, especially with racing. Make sure to equip your character properly before joining in online sessions.

, Get in touch with Lester and Martin for missions that usually involve teamwork to succeed, such as heists. That being said, the most effective way of doing missions on GTA V is by inviting other players to join your crew or you joining other groups. Group missions generate 20% more reputation than doing missions on solo.

, Avoid alarming the cops. Alarming the cops during missions will make your task harder to accomplish. It is better to leave your star level (warning level) at low or better yet, zero to make your ranking up hassle-free. If you have alarmed the cops already, make sure not to be caught to avoid penalty.

, Don’t forget to upgrade your weapon and vehicle. Having dependable weapons and get away vehicles is a sure way to make your RP grinding faster. However, spend your money wisely. Don’t just waste your money on clothes or other stuff that just affects aesthetics.

, You can also earn RP by just simply challenging other players for a game of tennis, golf, and other activities. This can be a great boost for your RP and it's fun to do too!

, When you’re already in the roll of taking in missions left and right, the competition gets tighter. Some online players might just put a bounty on your head or just plainly kill you to steal your cash or expensive vehicle. These things can be avoided if you play smart.

, You can deposit your cash using your phone’s browser and deposit online. You don’t have to carry all your hard earned money in your pocket all the time. This makes your money secured even if someone kills you out of nowhere and tries to mug you. Just carry enough money and you’ll be fine.

, Having a lot of friends online is a sure way of driving away enemies. Online players that have their eyes on you will have second thoughts targeting you if they find out that you have a lot of friends and that you can retaliate immediately if they decide to touch you.

, You can store your fancy vehicles in garages so that they cannot be easily stolen or destroyed by other online players.

, Don’t forget to improve your abilities as you gain ranking. Some abilities will just be unlocked once you reach a certain level. Having improved abilities will not only make your survival rate in GTA V Online higher, it will also make it easier for you to recruit other players to join your crew.

, Have a steady flow of cash. You won’t be able to upgrade anything without money. Fast ways of earning money is by doing quick missions. If you want higher pay outs, consider doing heists and bounty hunting.


You can also purchase GTA Dollars straight from PlayStation Network or from Xbox Games Store.

, All your online stats will be posted on the Rockstar Social Club. Make sure to check out how your character is doing and where are you at in the GTA V Online leaderboards.

, Aside from your own stats, you can also check out your crew, friends, or even other players’ stats, too.

First off, learn how to zoom.,
Figure out what look speed is good for you.,
When looking around while zoomed in, be very careful not to accidentally click the thumb pad.,
Try to look around with smooth, sweeping gestures.,
Only aim for the head once you have some serious skills or if the target is unaware and is not moving aim for the body and shoot twice.

,
If the target is moving, put the reticle in their path and fire when they walk into it.

,
If a target is jumping, don't bother trying to hit them while they are in the air; wait until they hit the ground between jumps because they will land in a predictable spot, and it takes a bit before they can do the second jump.

,
If possible, shoot for fusion cores near the target.,
If the target is in a ghost, don't try to hit them, aim for the gas tank.,
If you are being sniped at while attempting to snipe them, move your body rather than your right stick.,
If you are close range sniping, keep your reticule at head level, so when you fire you are more likely to hit them in the head.

,
Remember to reload anytime you aren't sniping.,
If you are being shot at while trying to snipe, don't bother.,
When looking for targets, think of where other people are likely to be headed.,
Likewise, try not to be too obvious in choosing where you will snipe from.,
Try to blend in.,
Don't waste shots.,
Use cover.,
Have a good secondary weapon in case someone finds you.,

You have two zoom levels, 5X and 10X. Click once for 5X, twice for 10X. Click a third time, and you go back to the ordinary HUD.;
, Start out with a low speed. As you get better, you can turn it up. You can change the look speed in settings.

, Doing so will either zoom you in too far, or zoom out, giving your target plenty of time to get away while you attempt to get a bead on them again.

, This will make it easier to stop on a target. Jerky movements will only make you less accurate.

,,,, They don't move, and are often times more effective than a shot to the chest.

, Then you can pick them off as they try to run away. Even if you do manage to hit them once, you probably won't hit them again to finish them off.

, ""Walk"" your screen over until your target is in the reticule. This will simultaneously help to avoid their shots and help you aim.

,, You don't lose any ammo when reloading, and you will regret it if you don't.

, You won't hit them while zoomed out if they are at range, so you should just switch to another weapon.

, Other snipers will be wanting to get up high for a vantage point. If you're playing CTF, look around their flag; someone will probably be covering it. Also, talk to allies. They can tell you if they see someone. This can be very helpful

, While certain places are nice to snipe from, They will be the first places others look when trying to pick off snipers. If you are in ascension and you immediately head for the sniper tower, you won't be there long. Try sniping from the shotgun stairs or from the banshee spawn.

, Choose a darker primary color, and stick to the shadows. A yellow spartan is not very stealthy.

, An empty sniper rifle is not very helpful, and they are hard to come by on most maps, unless you are playing snipers.

, It makes you harder to find.

, As you know, snipers are not good for close range.

, Your motion detector is off when you're zoomed, as is your peripheral vision. Assassinating a sniper is easy if they're concentrating on something else.

, If you kill some one, move to a different spot, they will most likely look to kill you in that spot. Try to move around the battlefield so that your enemies will not be wary of your new sniping spot. Boom Headshot.

Work on the mental aspects.,
Try not to get mad at yourself or the game.,
Don't be nervous.,
Practice.,
Maintain control of the power weapons.,
Be aware of who the host is when you're playing online.,
Learn techniques such as BXR and Grenade reloading.,
Use the following techniques when using the following weapons.",How to Play Halo 2," Halo is an incredibly mental game. One has to be smart in order to be successful. An important topic is out-thinking your opponent. Try to think what your opponent is going to do before he does it. This is key to any match. Think of the strong points on each map and all the locations of valuable weapons. At the start of each game, this is where your opponent(s) will go.;
, Most Halo played is online, where lots of latency (lag) and trash talk exist. In order to be successful, one must not let these things effect their game play. When you become mad, it clouds your judgment and causes you to play very differently than what you usually would. So, stay cool, and brush it off. It will help a ton in the long run.

, At tournaments, it is hard not to be nervous. You can also become nervous when playing online. All you can do is say to yourself, ""I'm going to play to the best of my abilities and that's all there is to it"". You're not going to intentionally play bad, so try your hardest not to worry about it.

, If you're into the MLG scene, practice is amazingly important. The BR is the weapon of choice for every game type, so I suggest you become efficient with it. An efficient BR is when you can consistently out-shoot others around you. You're BR shots should usually be aimed towards the head of the opponent. Four headshots kill anyone that doesn't have an over shield.

, Power weapons consist of the sniper rifle, rocket launcher, sword, shotgun, and plasma pistol(only in certain MLG game types). Maintaining control of these weapons is a key to success. When you run out of ammo, tell your teammates when you drop it so you know to move to that weapons location so you can pick it up when it respawns.

, You can tell who host is at the start of the game. Hold down the back button when the game starts, and whoever doesn't have a red (X) by there name is the host. The host has an advantage on line and on a LAN connection. It is just much easier to notice online. The host's weapons are far more accurate and effective, because all the information is going through his xbox to yours. Thus it takes information longer to travel to your box, creating latency in your shots/grenades etc.

, The BXR is just what it sounds like. The player hits (B) to melee. After the melee, they hit (X) to cancel the animation of the melee, and (R) to fire the BR. If done successfully, you can kill your opponent almost instantly. Try to keep your aiming reticule at head-level, because a headshot when you hit (R) is need for the instant kill. Also, when throwing a grenade, you can automatically reload your weapon by hitting LXX. (L) throws the grenade, and the (XX) causes the weapon to reload the weapon without going through the reload animation. Very handy because you can shoot through half of a clip of ammo and reload in the middle, but still continue shooting. This technique is only available if you aren't host. Another glitch that is becoming even more popular is RRX. RRX shoots two BR burst almost simultaneously. You Must hit (RR) and then (X) right after the (RR) to do this. This is incredibly difficult to get the hang of, but once you do, it is devastatingly efficient.

,

Battle Rifle - Use the scope and aim for the head every time, use it like the pistol in Halo 1.






Needler - If you're going to use this weapon, dual wield and keep aiming at an enemy as the needles are guided and can explode inside the enemy if there are enough shot.






Rocket Launcher - Aim for the floor right next to where they are standing.






Energy Sword - Make the targeting point turn red and then slash through.






SMG - Duel Wield these if possible, always aim for the chest.






Plasma Pistols - Overcharge the pistol and then wait for someone to pass by, as soon as there gamertag comes up, release the trigger and the plasma will follow the target until it hits.






Sniper rifle - Always aim for the head and it can zoom up to 10x.






Plasma Rifles - It's best to duel wield one of these with an smg if possible.






Ghost






The ghost is a well rounded vehicle, perfect for almost all problems. If you want to practice with one to avoid a lock with a rocket launcher, put it on overdrive, then off for a split second just enough for the ghost to turn in a different direction so the rocket won't get it.


Spectre






The spectre is a vehicle designed exactly like the warthog, so remember to get a friend to go on the turret, without someone on the turret, this vehicle is useless.


Wraith






Take advantage of the wraith's ability to shoot powerful bursts of plasma, and overdrive to your advantage. The wrath is like a slow moving, and a much more powerful, ghost.


Banshee






This is without doubt the funnest vehicle in the game. You can fly around on a map without any problem, and you can use it like a ghost as well.


Machine Gun Warthog






Exactly like the spectre, you will need someone to go on the turret for you, other than that you would need to run someone over to get a kill.


Gauss Warthog






This is a more powerful version of the warthog because of its upgraded turret gauss gun. It fires a missile other then little bullets. Otherwise it is a usual warthog.


Scorpion Tank






A more powerful human version of the wrath. This vehicle has two different weapons to fire, one is the main gun, and a machine gun. Right trigger to fire main cannon Left to fire machine gun.


Machine gun turret






Usually useless, unless it is used in an open area. Because it has endless bullets, once you start firing, don't stop.


Plasma Turret






This turret is a very good turret, it has an awesome firing ability and looks pretty cool to.

In Campaign, the only enemies you should really ever stick are the Elites.,
In multiplayer, throw the grenade, but compensate for their distance to you.",How to Stick a Plasma Grenade to Enemies in Halo 2," There are several ways to do this.


One way is to empty their shield (fastest way is with the Plasma Pistol), and as they stagger, throw the grenade.






Another way is to run up to them. When they try to punch you, move out of the way while throwing the grenade.






A third way is just to throw it, but that's not a good strategy if the enemy is moving.





;
, Usually, the grenade would fall before it hit the enemy when your cross-hairs are on them, so it's not a good idea to attempt the stick.


If they are close, throw it right at them. If they're a little further, throw it in front of them so they walk right into it.

First you need to get your crouch on headlong any spot will do that you can crouch underneath in a spot and stay crouched without holding the joystick down.

,
Once you get your crouch don't crouch again or you will UN glitch yourself.

,
There are some stairs that lead up to one of the bases next to a bridge go up those stairs, turn around and face the stairs, then run on the ledge on your left side that's next to the stairs and jump when you get almost halfway to the end if you do it right you should clear the edge of the ledge at the end, hold forward till just before you land if the bounce is done right it should bounce you all the way to the top of the pillar on the base directly across from you the pillar is on the corner of the base.

,
While you are on the pillar look towards the base of the crane and you will see a skinny bar there that's just thick enough for you to land on jump down onto the bar and hold forward until your about to land and if you do it right it should bounce you to the top of the crane.

,
Now I'm going to teach you how to rocket jump this glitch is kind of like the sword fake only because your using a rocket launcher instead of a sword it has a much longer range.

,First of all you need a rocket launcher as your primary weapon and a sword as your secondary weapon, second make sure your rocket has no ammo or you could accidentally kill your buddy, and third make sure your buddy is on the opposing team or playing against you so the reticent turns red whenever you aim at him

,
Have your rocket out and hit the X, Y, and R (RT on the 360 controller) buttons at the same time repeatedly if you do it right you should go flying past your friend.

,
This next glitch I am going to teach you is a fun host glitch to do it will not get you out of the map but it is really fun to do.

,
First you need to find out which player has host connection I will tell you why in a minute to find out who has host, as soon as the game starts hold the back button on your controller everybody's emblem will have an X on it except the host.

,
Now to do the glitch you need to get inside the banshee.,This next glitch will get you on top of the X building on Headlong

,
First use the double bounce I taught you earlier to get on top of the crane and out side of the map.,Run and jump off of the building ledge and onto the building that the X building is on and hold forward till just before you land, if done correctly you should do little hop when you hit the ground now get back on the building ledge you were on before remember don't crouch and keep moving or you will have to glitch yourself again you should be able to get onto the slope and back onto the building ledge without crouch jumping by the way this bounce is extremely difficult to do

,Run and jump back onto the building that the X building is on again only this time make sure you land on the very edge of the building and hold forward till just before you land if done correctly you will bounce super high

,
As soon as you bounce turn a ways to your left then keep holding forward till just before your about to land and do not change direction, then it should bounce into the first window of the X building where there is a slope go to the top of the slope remember to keep moving and do not crouch jump off the top of the slope and hold forward till just before you land and land on the edge of the window and it should bounce you to the second window repeat for the rest of the windows.

",How to Glitch out of Maps in Halo 2," To sword fake, you will need a sword and an opponent. Make your reticle red on your partner and press R and X and A on the controller (RT on the Xbox 360 controller) at the same time.;
,, You should first start simply. Put wraiths as your primary heavy vehicle and go to Headlong.

, Position the Wraith in front of the beginning of the incline.

, Note that you need to create a game type first in which you start with over shields or this will kill your buddy.

,, Your friend should go flying up and out into the unknown reaches of Headlong into a distant new part of Headlong.

,, To get up ledges in the ""New World"" have your reticle in the air above your friend. Then have him jump up into the air.

, This should prove useful for getting up ledges too large to crouch jump up.

,,,,,,,,,,, There is a bridge connecting the base that is at the bottom of the crane to the other base right next to that bridge is a window you need to park the banshee inside of that window and get out of the banshee if you do it right the banshee will stay in the window on the hosts screen but it will fall to the ground on everyone else's screen (this trick can only be done on XBox Live and it is best if the host does this glitch). On everyone else's screen they will be trying to get inside of the banshee on the ground but it won't let them because it is not technically on the ground it is still in the window and if you blow up the banshee in the window it will fall to the ground on your screen but another banshee will just appear out of the sky on everyone else's screen fun for freaking people out.

,, Once you get outside of the map you will see a big building directly in front of you this is from on top of the crane by the way, go and get on top of that building not all the way to the top of the tallest ledge you can get to and if you turn around and face the crane then to your left on the ledge if you look down you should see a little skinny ledge with a slope at the end you need to get on that ledge, once your on the ledge you need to auto crouch now the auto crouch is an alternate means of glitching yourself so you can super bounce when you don't have anything to use to get your crouch.

, There's a loading point in the tunnel that leads out, at any point before the loading point if you hijack the banshee it will explode, and if the banshee hits the loading point before you do it will disappear, so what you want to do is right before it hits the loading point hijack it and you want to have passed the loading point before fully enter the banshee.

A double shot is simply a button combo of pulling the right trigger twice, and the x button once, all within 1 second.,
Another thing you can do is RRX YY RRX which kills your opponent much quicker than 4 normal shots.,
This takes a lot of practice to master, so don't give up.

,
A good way to practice this would be to try to do a lot of Team Hardcore in matchmaking and just attempting to double shot every time you're not in a fight.

,
Also, when in multiplayer chose the Midship level if you are by yourself because the explosive gas tanks explode after six shots (or two rounds)with the battle rifle so if you do it right you will get a rewarding explosion.

,
And the stairwell on Midship was for me, perfect for practicing the crouch or natural(regular) jump double-shot (see below).,
Here's a hint if you change the config on your controller to boxer the double beatdown then rifle shot (BxBR)will be that much easier to use.But i warn you with that config some of the other tricks in this page are practically impossible to do.GOOD LUCK!

, This is a personal preference. If you like close and fast battles, then a higher setting will suit you. The opposite is true for sniper lovers.

, Find out good places on Lockout to lob grenades to various key points. Know how a plasma grenade arcs so you can stick well in clutch situations. In most matchmaking game types, you start with 2 frags, so practice bouncing and throwing them to the enemy.

, Otherwise, a Rocket Launcher or Plasma Grenade will destroy you.

, Some players love to hide behind corners and remain crouched. Others have the analog stick pushed to the edge the entire game. Both styles have pros and cons. Try them.

, Talk with your team. Even chit-chat is useful for goading them into useful communication. Report every enemy sighting and keep your ears open to weapon locations.

, The best way to improve is to play against people who match your skill level. Team-based skills are hard to get from matchmaking by yourself.

, Too many players say they want to get better, but don't make an effort to. Next time you turn on the Xbox, make a goal to only use plasma grenades in one game, or to no-scope whenever you have the sniper rifle. Such limits can be fun but they also help your skills.

,, If you don't have any great weapons remember:


Two weapons aren't always better than one. A good grenade can sometimes make the difference in a firefight. A second weapon takes grenades away. If you are using an SMG, either lob a grenade in early and finish up with the SMG or if you can get away then open up with the SMG and toss the grenade in afterwards for the kill. Note: Doing the latter method will require an excellent grenade, meaning that if they are backing up you throw it far, if they are moving in you throw it short.
It's a good practice when throwing grenades to bounce them off of the floor in closer ranges. It'll explode faster so it makes it easier to make the good grenade.
You can grab a quick noob combo (BR and plasma pistol).

When playing multiplayer, learn where weapons spawn on the maps you like to play.,

When you have good confidence at sensitivity 3, you can either move up to 4, or stay and hone your skills at 3.







,, Strafing is important because it reduces your chances of getting hit from ranged attacks (as in, other riflemen or snipers). Also if you're careful and control your strafing well, it can actually increase your accuracy.


When up against a person with good sniper skills, strafing won't help too much (they probably know how to counter it) at this point. It's a good idea to find a hiding place that has multiple sides to attack from.






Pop out quickly and lure them to camp at one side, then go to another side and scope em. This will knock them out of the scope.






Next, proceed to strafe while shooting them and they won't have a way to react quickly enough to live.






If they found cover, try to lob a grenade there. Even a grenade 15 feet (4.6 m) off target will kill. If you didn't toss a grenade, or did, but didn't kill them, then you can:






Rush and hopefully get them while they're still recharging
Camp them.


Less experienced snipers should be no problem, since often they can barely hit a stationary target.







, Become paranoid, assume all red blips are close range maniacs. This will naturally cause you to widen the distance between the enemy and you. Now, just pick them off with the scope. IF YOU ARE CAUGHT OFF-GUARD, run from them. Strafing will only slow you down here. Back pedal and start pumping rounds into their head. They will most likely be headed straight at you so this shouldn't be difficult. If you have plasma grenades, stick them on the enemy and run like the wind. If you think they are inexperienced, jump over their heads, and BXR them (B...XR) that's how the sequence works. Or, if they're very inexperienced, just jump, spin and assassinate them with a melee attack to the back.

, Another advantage that you gain from creating disk images is that you can create a disk image for CDs or DVDs.


In simple terms, you can mount the CD from an image stored on your hard drive. This way, you don't have to locate that disk again.

Volume Name—This is the name that will be given to your image when it is mounted.
Volume Size—A new disk image will no doubt need to possess a specific size. You can either choose from a range of values, or you can enter a value of your own choice.
Volume Format—If you need your disk image to be in a specific format, then you can change it; otherwise, it is highly recommended that you leave it at the default value.
Encryption—You are given two options to choose from regarding encryption.
Partitions—In this option, you can select whether you’d like to make a DVD/CD image, a regular image, or an image that can be booted by OS X.
Image Format—It is recommended that you stick to the default value, unless you know what you are doing.

, After you have filled in the options and the values of your choice, then click on the Create button located at the bottom of the option box.

, After the process has been completed, the Disk Utility will automatically mount the new image on your OS X desktop, which will be ready to have files added to it.

, When you have added whatever you want to add to the disk image, you can drag the mounted image to the trash, which will eject the mounted image.


The disk image can now be moved between computers and transferred with ease.

The Phone Guy confirms that a suit was used to lure the children to their deaths (this suit is confirmed to be Springtrap, supposedly an original animatronic along with Golden Freddy).

, In the first three games, an intro of a newspaper clipping relays what's going on. In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the letter shows that a new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza is opening. At the end, it is closed, scheduled for a downsizing. In the first FNaF, it says that they are holding a grand-reopening (the Phone Guy lets slip that it is a smaller-scale version restaurant). In the third game, it is revealed that you are guarding a FNaF themed horror attraction, 30 years after the events of the first game. The ending newsletter reveals that Fazbear Fright burns down.

, In the second game, he volunteers to take your position, and you get moved to the day shift. In the first game, he mentions that he is on his final shift, but Night 4's recording implies that he is killed before he can retire.

, There are few definite clues as to who the killer is, why the hauntings are occurring, or if the killer was even really caught. The biggest bread crumb is the Purple Guy who killed the single crying child (which most likely possessed the Puppet) and set the whole thing in motion. There is a possibility that there are two Purple Guys, but only one is the murderer, William Afton. His son, Mike Afton, was killed and taken over by Ennard, eventually turning purple from the robot living inside the decaying corpse for so long. It was Mike that was crushed by the spring locks and became Springtrap, due to confusion with his father. According to Sister Location, this is a likely scenario, but it's all still speculation.

, A 6th animatronic is revealed, known as Springtrap. The other animatronics in the game are mere hallucinations (this is due to the animatronics most likely being scrapped/stored away at the end of 5 Nights at Freddy's).

Watch the How to Make Five Nights at Freddy's Not Scary videos.",How to Not Be Scared of Five Nights at Freddy's2," This may not be very high on your list of priorities, but if you can find out why so many people like it, it may be easier for you.

, The FNAF series has a very complicated and sometimes incomprehensible backstory. Deciphering the mystery has become a mission of sorts to many people online, and it has yet to be debunked.


There are several FNAF YouTubers such as Smike and 8-Bit Gaming who produce FNAF videos on a regular basis that you can watch. Game Theory also has done a few videos on the series.

, The videos are produced specifically to poke fun at FNAF, and make them seem not so sinister.

Listen to the phone guy.,
Use power sparingly.,
Be very careful from the third night on.,
Understand the animatronics behavior.,
Be prepared for the fifth night.,
Do your best.",How to Play Five Nights at Freddy's," The phone guy was a previous security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. He will give you useful and important information. Some of the information he gives is to check security cameras often, as well as to close doors and turn on lights only if necessary. He also give some background information on the restaurant itself.


As the nights go on, the Phone Guy's messages will be shorter. Apply what you have learned from him. The movement patterns of the animatronics will be much faster than the first night.
On the fourth night, the Phone Guy has recorded his last message. It is his last message because he is about to be attacked by animatronics, or as many people assume, Golden Freddy (a hallucination you can see on any night).;
, You have a limited power supply for each night. If you run out of power, Freddy may catch you. Your shifts last for six hours, from 12 AM to 6 AM, so keep this in mind while rationing power. The transition from 5 AM to 6 AM can interrupt Freddy's attack if you run out of power, so try to survive until 5 AM at the least.

, While the game will still be tough the first two days, the animatronics will become more active on the third night. Be sure to have most of your power saved. You'll need it much more on nights three, four, and five.

, There are five animatronics in the game: Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, Foxy the Pirate Fox, Freddy Fazbear, and Golden Freddy. Bonnie and Chica come from the left and right doors, having a random path. Foxy goes to the left door and is more aggressive depending on how much you check on him. Freddy comes to the right in a single path. Golden Freddy is summoned through a rare appearing poster., The Phone Guy will not have a message for you that night, so you will be on your own. The animatronics will be as active as ever as this is the last main night, and this is the one that you'll need your power the most. On night five you get a strange, garbled phone call that is speculated to come from Freddy. It's quite possible that after Phone Guy's death, the animatronics had access to the phone, which is why you receive this. Don't let it distract you though!

, If this is your first time playing, be prepared. Five Nights at Freddy's is somewhat weird, and very scary. Be prepared for not just the fifth night, but things like jumpscares, animatronics traveling, and much more!


If you have succeeded in surviving the fifth night, you can play night six and seven.
Upon beating Night 6 you can unlock night 7. Here you can set the animatronic's AI difficulty.

Flip up the monitor.",How to Summon Golden Freddy in Five Nights at Freddy's1," Then open the monitor and go to CAM 2B (West Hall Corner) and flip the monitor up and down until you see a poster of a close-up of Golden Freddy's face.


Note that this method does not work on Android devices.;
, You'll see Golden Freddy sitting in front of you.

, If you want him to kill you, just leave him there for a few seconds, but opening the monitor is the only way (besides completing a night) for him to disappear.

Reel in the fish.",How to Fish in Terraria," Cut down as many trees using your Copper Axe as you can. Just be sure to point your mouse to the point where the tree and the ground meet to cut it all down. The tree will drop wood and almonds that are then automatically placed on your inventory when you get in close proximity to them.


It’s advisable that you get 200 to 300 blocks of wood early on since a lot of the early-game items use it as a crafting ingredient/requirement.;
, Go to your inventory screen (default key is Esc) and craft a basic workbench. Once it’s crafted, you can then place it on a flat surface and exit out of your inventory screen.

, Move your character close to the Workbench and then open your inventory again. Now you’ll need to look for the Wood Fishing Pole on the items that are available for crafting. You can then place it on your inventory after you’ve finished crafting it.


The Wood Fishing Pole is the easiest to craft of the four craftable fishing poles in the game. Other fishing poles like the Reinforced Fishing Pole, Fisher of Souls, and Fleshcatcher, both of which require Lead/Iron Anvils and metals like Lead, Iron, Crimtane, and Demonite Bars to craft., To get the Merchant NPC, you’ll first need to build him a house. Start by building a 9 block (width) by 7 (height) block frame/enclosure made of Wood (or any other available block). Additionally, make sure that you leave a 3 block space for a door.

, After making the house’s frame, go back to your workbench and open your inventory to craft a wooden table, chair, walls, and a door. Once you’re done crafting these, make sure that you place them on your inventory.

, Go to the frame/enclosure you made earlier and place the furniture (table and chair) in the area inside of the enclosure. Once they’re in place, cover the background layer inside the enclosure with the wooden walls and close it off by installing a door.

, After building the house, go outside and look for slimes. Use your sword to kill as many as you can and then collect the gels that they drop after they die.


Slimes are found in all biomes and will spawn during the day. Other than the sword, you can also use your axe and pickaxe to kill these monsters since they’re fairly weak.
You’re usually going to find a couple of slimes in the area where you spawn for the first time in your world.

, Once you’ve accumulated to 10 to 15 gel, you can then go back to your workbench. Open up your inventory and craft as many torches as you possibly can.

, Place one or two torches inside the house you built earlier to give it lighting.

, Go ahead and make another 5 of these houses to accommodate other NPCs.Although the only NPC required for fishing is the Merchant, you’re still going to need the others to access advanced crafting and healing features as well as weapons. Making their houses in advance will save you time later on in the game.

, Coins are not only dropped by killing monsters but also when you break jars as well as by opening chests found all over the world. You’ll need to get 50 coins in your inventory before the Merchant NPC will spawn in your world and take shelter in one of the houses that you built.The 50 silver coin requirement will only work for the Merchant. Other NPCs have their own requirements and will usually spawn once you defeat bosses or have certain items in your inventory.

, You will get a notification once the Merchant NPC has spawned. Once this happens, go to your house/houses and look for him there.

, Have your character stand close to the merchant and right-click on him. Click on the Shop option and you should now see the Bug Net as one of the items that he’s selling. Take note that you’ll need at least 25 silver coins to purchase one.

, After purchasing the Bug Net, equip it by placing it on your item hotkeys. Critters are found all over the Terraria overworld, but you’ll want to focus on catching worms, snails, sluggies, fireflies, and buggies due to their high bait power., The easiest way to fish is to go to the nearest ocean biome. However, you’ll need to be careful since you’re probably going to come across some high-level monsters on your way there.In order to get something to bite the bait, you’ll need to make sure that you are fishing in an area that has at least 75 continuous (vertically or horizontally) tiles/blocks of any liquid (this includes lava and honey). This technically means that you can fish in any body of water so long as they adhere to the 75 continuous tiles/blocks requirement.
Although it’s possible to make your own fishing area, it will take time. You might want to look into this though, once you’ve acquired more powerful equipment after defeating a couple of bosses.
You can also fish in lava and honey, but you will need to make sure that you have the right fishing pole and bait.

, Once at the ocean, open up your inventory and equip the Wood Fishing Pole to any of your hotkeys.

, In the same manner, equip your bait into one of your ammunition slots.

, With both the bait and fishing pole equipped, you can now cast your fishing line by pointing and clicking your mouse on the water.


Make sure that you’re standing on a dry land (or on a platform) and not submerged in water when you cast your line or else you won’t be able to catch anything., Now you’ll need to wait for the bobber to move, indicating that you’ve caught something. Once it’s moving, click the mouse again and you should now have the item on your inventory.

Once done, it should be in the ""Games"" section in the Steam client.

, When the game starts up, you will be met with a creepy-looking title screen. You want to click New Game.

You start on Night 1. Only the toy animatronics move in this night.

, Be careful, because it can run out of batteries. When you use it, you can see down the hallway in front of you and see if any animatronics are coming down it. Flash it a few times at any animatronics in the hallway., You also want to check these often because animatronics can come from them, the button above them toggles a light., This is especially important if they're in the vents or your office. There will be two buttons at the bottom of the screen. The red one brings up your mask if you hover the mouse over it.

When/if you hear banging from the vents, then that means it's safe to take the mask off.

, The white button at the bottom of the screen activates the camera. Using this, you'll be able to monitor other parts of the map. In the camera, you have to watch out for Cam 11. Also watch out for the vents, too, which are Cam 5 and 6., On the camera in Cam 11, there is a thing you have to do to keep an animatronic away from you. There will be a button saying ""Wind Up Music Box"" and a circle next to that.

Do not let that circle run out. If it does, the marionette, which is the thing that's in the room, will probably get you soon. You generally only want the circle to drop halfway before re-winding it.

, Whenever an animatronic appears in front of you in your office area, put the mask on instantly. With Toy Freddy, you only have 1.2 seconds to put it on. If you don't, then you're toast. The mask will trick the animatronics into thinking that you're one, so it's an essential.

The mask does not work on Foxy, who is another animatronic.

, If you pass the first night, then congrats! It will progressively get harder the further into the game you get. Don't worry if you die multiple times- just keep trying., Night 2 is almost the same as Night 1, but Foxy will appear in your hallway, and the animatronics will come out earlier, this includes the old ones.

Keep in mind that you must check Cam 11 after each time you check your office.

, Now it gets harder, as forgetting to wear the mask after checking the vents will trigger a jumpscare, next time you put down your cameras.

Foxy will also become more active during the night, so don't forget to flash him away.

, This is very similar to Night 3. Keep an eye on Foxy and the Puppet., This night is the hardest of the first five.

To complete this night, you must check Cam 11 all the time. If an animatronic is in your office for a long time, go straight to the Prize Corner, and wind the box to at least half way.
Toy Bonnie and Foxy will be problems in this situation, as Foxy will stay in the hall for ages, and even the slightest mistake will trigger a jumpscare. Toy Bonnie will stay in the vent for ages too, and if you don't put on the mask and keep him away long enough, it will result in a jumpscare. You may get lucky though, as another animatronic may get in your office before Toy Bonnie gets a chance to jumpscare you.

, When you beat the game, you can customize the danger of all the animatronics, and you get the option to do a 6th Night."

Find necessary protection.,
Acquire a decent pickaxe.,
Dig a two block wide tunnel straight down.,
Work until you run into a ruined house.,
Congratulations!",How to Find a Ruined House in Terraria," Good armor includes Necro/Crimson, Gold, and Silver. Arm yourself with your strongest weapons.

Having an Obsidian Skull or any item that grants immunity to fire or lava is recommended. If you have the Lava Waders, these are extremely useful. Also bring several potions of healing, as you most likely will be harmed by Fire Imps. If you don't want to fall and sink into the lava, get some wings.
A shadow key is essential; it can be used infinitely, and is the only way to unlock Shadow Chests. It is found within Gold Chests in the Dungeon. Also remember to bring a potion of Recall or a Magic Mirror so you can make a quick getaway if things turn sour!;
, If this is your first time to the Underworld, then at least have a Deathbringer Pickaxe, as you may be digging for quite a while before reaching the Underworld if you rely on a Bronze Pickaxe.

If you've been to the Underworld before and mined Hellstone ore, use a Molten Pickaxe.
This may seem like a boring step, but is imperative to your survival and will maximize your loot.

, Be sure to look out for caverns, as they will provide a quicker way down. If you do this correctly, after a couple of minutes of tireless digging, you will notice the background changes to a wall of rock with many glowing lava veins. This means that you have arrived in the Underworld., You'll likely find one (made up of Hellstone or Obsidian Bricks and probably partially filled with lava) after traversing across the terrain for a little bit. Be sure to check it for loot.

Be careful of those Fire Imps and Hellbats!

, You have successfully found and looted a Ruined House!

Now go find some more and keep gathering loot before teleporting home with your Potion of Recall or Magic Mirror.

Demon Altars are found in the Corruption, and Crimson Altars are found in, well, the Crimson. Find them and craft a Suspicious Looking Eye with the Lenses.;
, Make sure it's not near your regular base. Include nearby (maybe in a small five by five shack):

The Nurse NPC
Chests will several different types of weapons
A Campfire
A Magic Mirror in case things get out of hand
Potions

, It's essential to remember that you must kill the Eye of Cthulhu before morning, or it will despawn.,

The fight itself is fairly straightforward. Always have the high ground (Frostspark Boots, Spectre Boots, Magic Carpet, Rocket Boots, Cloud in a Bottle, etc.), and watch out for the spawned Servants of Cthulhu.

, It suddenly changes forms! Don't panic though.

This form change will be signified by the Eye of Cthulhu spinning very rapidly. However, it no longer spawns Servants of Cthulhu.

,

A quick way to kill the Eye of Cthulhu is to set it on fire.

Fight off the Hungry.,
Fight the Wall itself.,
Collect the loot dropped by the Wall of Flesh.,
Locate the Hallow.,
Break Demon Altars.,
Mine Cobalt/Palladium.",How to Prepare for Hardmode in Terraria," Hellevators are 3-block wide tunnels that prevent spreading of Corruption/Crimson. Why is this crucial? Every biome has something unique about it, and has unique drops, and this will get you far.;
, This includes Molten Armor (25 defense for a full set), Night's Edge (42 melee damage), a Molten Pickaxe (can mine Cobalt/Palladium, trust me, you will not regret crafting one), Sharanga (35 ranged damage, turns all arrows in to Spectral Arrows), Flamarang, Sunfury, and a Phoenix Blaster.

, This makes your fight with the Wall of Flesh a lot easier.

, To summon the Wall, throw a Guide Voodoo Doll in to a lava pool. If you are playing on mobile version of Terraria, just tap on the doll and it will summon it.

, The Hungry are little, mouth shaped creatures at the front off the wall. Use your Night's Edge or your Sunfury to fend them off. (Note: They will detach from the boss when they are down to 1/3 health.)

, This is when you should use your Phoenix Blaster, Flamarang, and your Sharanga. Your Sunfury also helps for this part too. Make sure to go for either the eyes or the mouth, because those are the only parts of it that take damage.

,  This may include, but not limited to, Pwnhammer, Breaker Blade, Clockwork Assault Rifle, Summoner Emblem, Sorcerer Emblem, Ranger Emblem, and Warrior Emblem. Make sure to have a pickaxe on you, because the loot is in a room with demonite bricks. Don't worry about where to find the room; it will be very close by.

, The Hallow is the Corruption/Crimson counterpart, where everything is happy and fun. It is normally on the other side of the world of where the the Corruption/Crimson is. Once you locate the Hallow, dig hellevators on the ends of that biome; it does spread like Corruption/Crimson.

, Find Demon Altars in your world, and destroy them with the Pwnhammer. It will bless your world with Cobalt, Mythril, or Adamantite.

, Cobalt/Palladium is crucial to the start of hardmode, and it can mine Mythril/Orichalcum, make your first set of hardmode gear, etc.

The Rotted Fork for its high knockback value
The Jester's Arrows for Creepers (more on that later)
The Blade of Grass
The Ball o' Hurt
Flaming Arrows (probably the most effective)

, There are two ways to do this:

Destroy three Crimson Hearts (found scattered throughout the Crimson.
Craft a Bloody Spine.

, You will have to kill them to even damage the Eye of Cthulhu.

The Jester's Arrows will work well against the Creepers, since they can pass clean through multiple rows. The Ball o' Hurt is also useful, given its wide range.

, The Creepers will disappear, and the Brain will begin to teleport.

It's not as bad as it sounds. Use the Blade of Grass to quickly disintegrate its health, and bam, it's dead.

,

Like the Eye of Cthulhu, the fight is pretty easy. Just make sure you don't trip off a ledge—you might want the Rocket Boots.
The Eater of Worlds tends to fly around a lot, so you may want a Bow and Arrows.

, Make sure to collect its Corrupt Ore, as this is necessary to progress in the game."

, Either:

Wait for the Slime Rain event (Desktop only), and defeat one hundred and fifty Slimes. After this, the King Slime spawns.
Make a Slime Crown with twenty Gel and a Platinum or Gold Crown.

,

The King Slime is one of the easiest bosses in the game. You probably don't even need any armor. Just hack away, making sure to avoid any sudden jumps he makes.

,

Once he's dead, collect his dropped Gel, as this will be useful later in the game.

It's a tiny, golden looking thing in the Hive.

,

Like the King Slime, Queen Bee is an easy fight. She'll fly around the Hive, occasionally pausing mid-flight. On these pauses, shoot her with Arrows.
You can also just jump and slash at her, but you might die with this method.

A Clock
Powerful levitation devices
Ranged weapons
Meteor Armor
A Space Gun
Mana restoring potions

, Set up a clock at the entrance and wait until it's almost night.

The Clock is there so you can keep track of time. If you haven't beaten Skeletron by dawn, he will instantly kill you.

,

Since the entrance to the Dungeon is a little cramped, you might want to battle on top of it.

, It has unlimited ammo, but does consume Manna, so be careful.

Aim for Skeletron's hands. Once they had been destroyed, shoot at his head.
Be sure to constantly move.

, Once he is defeated, you get several perks:

You can now enter the Dungeon without being slaughtered by Dungeon Guardians.

To get these, you first must smash a Shadow Orb (if you have a Corruption world) or Crimson Heart (if you have a Crimson world).;
, Each day after the aforementioned step, the Goblin Army has a small chance of occurring. The event isn't very hard to beat, but do this before it happens:

When the Goblin Army attacks, lead them away from your house and NPCs. Although they aren't as dangerous as other armies, such as Lunar, Pumpkin Moon, or Pirate Armies, they still can spawn in your house, destroying things and killing NPCs.
Prepare potions and weapons. As most Goblins in the Goblin Army use swords and other melee weapons, use ranged weapons to combat them. E.g., bows, guns, blowguns, etc.

,, Look for a bound goblin.

Right clicking on him will free him, giving you the Goblin Tinkerer NPC.
From him, you can buy both the Rocket Boots for 5 gold and the Tinkerer's Workshop for 10 gold.

,,

Underground Cabins are mini-uninhabited homes found in different underground biomes.
In the standard Underground Biome, you can find the Hermes Boots.
In an Underground Tundra or Snow Biome, you can find the Flurry Boots.

,

Any of these can be used in the recipe.

,

Make sure the Rocket Boots and the set you found aren't equipped as accessories.

, You can either equip them or store them until they're next needed.,

The Aglet can be found easily by exploring Forest Chests on the Surface. If you can't find one, you have a chance of getting it from a wooden crate while fishing.
The Anklet, however, requires more exploration. You can find one in the Underground Jungle Biome, inside of a Jungle Shrine or in a Jungle Crate (fished up only in a Surface Jungle Biome).

,,

They can be found randomly in the Underground Tundra or Snow Biome. Look in every Ice Chest you can find, as they contain the boots.

,, Now you have the Frostspark Boots. Equip them and enjoy."

, To get it, you need to combine the Muramasa, Light's Bane, Blood Butcherer, Blade of Grass, and the Fiery Greatsword together at a Demon/Crimson Altar. To get those swords:


Muramasa; Dungeon Chests
Light's Bane; 20 Demonite Bars
Blood Butcherer; 10 Crimstane Bars
Blade of Grass; 15 stingers, 12 Jungle Spores. Spores are found in the Underground Jungle, Stingers are dropped by Spiked Jungle Slimes, Dragon Hornets, and Hornets, all found in the Jungle.
Fiery Greatsword; 10 Hellstone Bars

, Molten Armor is the best, but you have to get Hellstone, which is found in the Underworld, to craft it. Just get Iron or Silver Armor.

, The is crafted from 10 Hellstone bars and an Enchanted Boomerang, which is typical Forest chest loot.

, You can get the Strong Spear, but we highly recommend a Dark Lance.

, You have a variety of choices of items that will get you high ground:


Wings (Hardmode only)
Spectre Boots
Frost spark Boots
Rocket Boots
Fart in a Jar
Cloud in a Bottle
Sandstorm in a Bottle
Blizzard in a Bottle
Shiny Red Balloon
Cloud in a Balloon
Sandstorm in a Balloon
Fart in a Balloon

Lucky Horseshoe
Frog Legs

Lightning Boots

, These will dramatically increase your chance of survival. Craft them from Obsidian Water Walking Boots (Water Walking Boots+Obsidian Skull), and a Lava Charm, found in Gold Chests in the Cavern.

, This will allow you open Shadow Chests in Ruined Houses, where you can find useful items.

, This will allow you to quickly traverse the Underworld. Combine these with the Lightning Boots for maximum speed.

, This will prevent you from being burned by Hellstone. It is crafted from 20 Obsidian.

, This will allow you to collect Hellstone.

, This sounds obvious, but the Lava can kill you quickly, and so can enemies. Lesser Healing Potions do the job, but Healing Potions and Greater Healing Potions (if you're in Hardmode) are much better.

, This allows you to control gravity. You'll have to be very careful, as it can be easy to fall in Lava.

, This helps you see Hellstone better, as it can blend in with other things. It also allows you to see locked Shadow Chests.

, This helps in the battle against the Wall of Flesh.

, This gives you Lava immunity for three minutes, which can make a big difference.

, Then redo it and redo it. This might sound boring, but there is no other really good way to get engrams.

, When you get to higher levels, and more strikes are unlocked, then do them. And redo them often.

, That way, you will get better results and better engrams.

, Once you are level 5, the Crucible can be a very good source of engrams. You just have to get good, because it is hard at first.

, This is another great way to get engrams. They are harder, get you better stuff, and are more fun than constantly repeating strikes or Crucible missions.

, These are yet another way to get engrams. They are like super-hard versions of the missions.

, This is very profitable when you have high-level friends to back you up.

, These are also a good equipment getter, but cannot be accessed until you are at a very high level.

, You can get you good money for buying engrams yourself.

On large maps with tanks (such as Downfall or Roundhouse), use a class with tank-penetrating weapons like the NT grenade and Bazooka/Satchel Charge, just remember your sniper. On small maps that have a lot of advantage sniping points, Castle for Example, will be an EXCELLENT place to make use of Bouncing Betties or a friend that will guard you while sniping.;
, This will help you learn which maps are good for sniping. Use your surroundings to figure out where you can snipe and where you can't. Camouflage can actually blend in quite well on some maps if you're prone in the shade and bushes, an example of a map like that would be Downfall in the trenches. If you can make yourself virtually invisible (not firing unless you have a straight shot) then you might be able to camp there for 1-3 shots although 1 is recommended while camping.

, You need to know how to switch weapons quickly, and kill rushers. Grabbing weapons of enemies you've killed is an excellent strategy and should become second nature. You should switch out your pistol (unless you have a Magnum or think you can take them) and pick up the gun (as long as it's a semi).

, If you can place them close to enemy entry points but out of sight, then place them there but remember to keep them hidden so enemies can't destroy them.

, Find some of your Xbox Live friends to help you out and go onto a private match and practice. The more you know about your weapons and their capabilities, the better of a sniper you will be.

, This means to put your reticle (cross-hair) in front of your target just a little bit. This will cause your target to run into your bullet and give you a pretty good shot. Just make sure not to go too far ahead or else you'll miss the bullet and s/he will take cover.

, This will allow you to gain levels quicker to get the better guns. You may use them up until which ever gun you want but it's recommended you use snipers for experience and use each one and complete challenges for the scopes as this adds a new competitive perspective to look into in the game.

, Make sure to set your perks to where you can use them to your advantage for each situation, just as in step one.

, Those are the most important aspects of the game. Whether you miss a shot or what not, you will get it eventually.

",How to Be Good at Nazi Zombies,";
,,,,,,,,,,,"
"
In order to do well in Nazi Zombies, there are a few things that every player must do to make it to the higher levels:


Soda Machines: Soda Machines are powerups (perks) that give you a special ability for a certain amount of time.,
NEW PERKS: As new zombie map packs have been released, there have been new perks that have been added to the game.",How to Do Well in Nazi Zombies (General)1," In the original 3 maps (Verruckt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese) there are 4 machines spread out on any Nazi Zombie map and they each have their own specific power-up.
Juggernog: This is probably the most important perk you can buy in the game. It is pricey (2500 points) but it is well worth your money if you want to survive in the game. The Juggernog makes your resistance to zombies better. What I mean by that is Zombies without the Juggernog can kill you in 2 hits. With the Juggernog, it will take 5-6 hits before you go down, making it an invaluable survival tool.
Quick Revive: This is cheaper than the Juggernog (1500 Points)but it is still worth your money. The Quick Revive is just what it is, it allows you to revive your teammates quicker than usual. This is important in later rounds as zombies get quicker and harder to kill, so the less time you spend trying to help someone, the better. In Solo Play, you can revive yourself with a purchase of a quick revive. When you go down with the perk, you automatically get revived. While your down and getting revived, the game gives you the upgraded version of the starting pistols (Mustang and Sally), which are now grenade pistols.
Speed Cola: This is a perk that allows you to reload your gun faster and to aim faster; it is basically a sleight of hand perk. This is the most expensive power-up (3000 Points) so save your money up to get it. This power-up comes in handy when you are cornered and need to reload fast. Definitely get this perk, especially if you have weapons that take a long time to reload (LMG's, Thunder Gun, etc.).
Double Tap and Double Tap 2x: Double Tap (2000 points) is a perk that allows your weapons to fire at a faster rate than normal. The original Double Tap is available in the WaW and Black Ops zombie maps. However, the Double Tap 2x; which is available in Black Ops 2 zombie maps, is different from the original. This upgraded version of the Double Tap not only allows you to fire faster, but it also makes your bullets more powerful, which is very helpful to the player. Double Tap 2x is definitely worth getting in the newer BO2 maps, but I would personally stay away from it in the older maps unless that is the only other perk you can buy outside of the original 3 sodas.;
, These perks are not contained within the first maps (with the exception of mule kick in Black Ops) and some perks are specific only to one map, so you have to play the different maps in order to access all of the new soda machines.


Dr.(PHD) Flopper (found in Ascension, Call of the Dead, Shangri-La, Moon, and Origins): Dr. Flopper (2000 points) is a perk that is found in the all of the Black Ops map packs; it is a perk that allows you to dive and create explosive damage. It is most effective when you dive into a group of zombies from heights (the lander platform area where you buy the Dr. Flopper in Ascension, for example). The zombies are destroyed instantly after you perform the jump. Also, another aid the perk provides is that you are immune to all recoil damage when shooting a ray gun at zombies in close range.
Dead Shot Daiquiri (Call of the Dead, Shangri-La, Moon, Mob of the Dead, and Origins): Dead Shot Daiquiri (1500 points) is a new perk that assists the player with shooting. When you aim down sight with any weapon with this perk, your aim is automatically directed towards the head of any approaching zombie. It also reduces sway in Sniper Rifles. This perk is helpful if you have a hard time aiming your weapon and getting head shots; if your a more advanced player, however, it is not as useful.
Mule Kick (available in every map on Black Ops including original WaW maps, Die Rise, Buried, and Origins): Mule Kick (3000 points) is a perk that simply allows you to have 1 extra weapon in your arsenal. This means that you have the ability to have 3 weapons as opposed to 2. You can treat this extra weapon just as you would your original 2, that includes upgrading it through the pack-a-punch. It is important to keep in mind, however, that if you go down, the third weapon you acquired goes away. Since the extra weapon is a result of the perk, when the perk goes away, so does this extra weapon. Very handy perk to have, especially in later rounds where ammo becomes a factor.
Stamin Up (Ascension, Call of the Dead, Shangri-La, Moon, Tranzit, Buried, Origins): Stamin Up (2000 points) is a perk that allows you to run faster and for a longer duration. It is a perk that is certainly helpful when you need to move through tighter areas of the map and need to move fast.
Tombstone (Tranzit): Tombstone (2000 points) is a new perk (found only in BO2) which allows you to come back to live without losing your perks and weapons. How it works is that when you go down, you are given an option to either hold down the action button and die right away (which says ""don't feed the zombies"") or you can wait for someone to revive you. Here is the catch; you can only regain all of your perks and weapons if you decide to hold down the action button and die immediately. If someone revives you before you complete this action, you do not get your perks back, only your weapons. If you die without using the tombstone perk, you would return to the next round in the game as if you never had the perk (with your starting pistol and nothing else). So if you want to utilize this perk, you need to hold down the action button immediately and die. When the next round begins, you need to find your tombstone (the icon that is left where you died the previous round). If you do not get to this icon within a certain amount of time, the icon goes away and you lose everything, so you need to make sure that you re-spawn close to it so you can get all of your weapons and perks back. It is a useful perk, however, risky for your team since now they have to fight the hordes of zombies without you.
Who's Who (Die Rise): This new perk (2000 points) is similar to the last one as it allows you to regain all of your perks and weapons if you go down. There are some differences though, most notable is the fact you have to revive yourself. Once you go down, you are re-spawned in an area close to where you went down. You are now in a limbo mode where you have the chance to revive yourself. The zombies still recognize you are alive and will still try to attack you while you are in this limbo state. In this mode you are armed only with a pistol to defend yourself (no perks). In order to revive yourself with all of your weapons and perks, you need to be able to elude the zombies and revive yourself without going down in this limbo state. You need to do this quickly, as there is a limited time given to revive the player with your limbo character. If you do go down in this limbo state, then you are down for good and need to be revived by another player. If you go don't go down but don't revive your character in time, then that ""limbo"" character becomes your playable character and you carry on through the game as normal. If you are now playing with your limbo character, you lose all of your perks and weapons and only armed with the pistol they give you. Not personally one of my favorite perks as it is complicated to use, especially during the later rounds where knifing and pistols do not kill the zombies.
Vulture Aid (Buried): This perk (3000 points) allows you to pick up more points for killing zombies and allows you to see all the items you can buy in the map. When you kill a zombie with this perk, the zombie either drops ammo or money. You have to run to where you killed that zombie to get the extras; an extremely helpful tool when ammo and/or money is tight. Also, the perk allows you to see anything on the map you can buy much more easily as it shows you larger and brighter icons that you can see from anywhere. These icons include the mystery box, other soda machines, and the wall weapons. Especially when you need something on the run, having this perk as a helpful reminder is very helpful.
Electric Cherry (Mob of the Dead and Origins): This new (2000 points) perk activates when players reload their weapons. When a player reloads, a shock is given out and electrocutes the zombies. The power of the shock depends on how much ammo you have left; if you have a lot of ammo, then the shock is small. If you have low ammo and reload, then the shock will be larger.
Der Wunderfizz-This perk (1500 points) provides a random perk to you with purchase, very similar to the mystery box concept. Need to be careful with this perk, as you can only get four perks and you might not get the perks you want through this machine.

"
"
Weapons are the most important part of Nazi Zombies as the quality of your weapons determines how far you get into the game.,
Good guns to buy are the MP40, AK74U, and the MP5K.,

If you have the money, buy the Bowie Knife as this is a very powerful, it can take out the strongest zombies in 2 or 3 swipes (be careful).,

Finally is the mystery box, this is one of the biggest factors of surviving Nazi Zombies.,
Pack-a-punch transforms your weapon into something truly devastating.",How to Do Well in Nazi Zombies (General)2," #Do not buy any weapons within the first 2 rooms unless you absolutely need to! The Olympia and the M14 are useless in rounds 5 and 6 so don't waste your money on them. Same applies to the PM63 and MPL, both lose their value a little later (Round 9-10). If you need a gun, buy one of the guns in the next room, but never buy a gun from the opening room.

, All of these guns are cheap and powerful. These can last you a few rounds longer (13-14) if you use them correctly. In the Black Ops 2 maps, a good gun to pick up is the MP50, a more advanced version of the MP40. More valuable weapons from BO2 include the AN-94, PDW, and SVU-50.

, In BO2, there is a new knife weapon called Galvaknuckles. While extremely expensive (6000 points), this weapon deals 1 hit kills to zombies all the way up to round 13. Very effective for picking up lots of points., The mystery box gives you a variety of guns (at 950 points a try) and it gives you access to the most powerful and the weakest guns in the game.

The mystery box is a gamble, you do not know what you are going to get, so if you do not get the gun you want after a few tries, stop and try again later. Using the mystery box too much will deplete your of points and that can really hurt if you get stuck in a bad situation. Treat the mystery box with caution.

, The damage of the gun and the ammo that the gun holds increases and your guns get a new camouflage (camouflage depends on the map). It costs 5000 points (and on Black Ops 2 and onwards, 2500 to repack-a-punch your guns) but will make surviving high rounds much easier. Some guns benefit from Pack-A-Punching more than other guns, for instance, starting pistols become grenade launchers but the Ray Gun pack-a-punched tends to just make it easier to make crawler zombies."
"
Turning on the power is a must if you want to reach higher levels in the game.",How to Do Well in Nazi Zombies (General)3," Turning on the power gives you access now to the traps, pack-a-punch, and to the perks.

Pack-A-Punch: The Pack-A-Punch is a machine that makes any gun in the game more powerful and it gives the gun more ammo. This is to be used wisely, as it is very expensive to pack-a-punch a gun (5000 points) and you cannot re-use your pack-a-punched gun once ammo runs out (unless you get a max ammo). The only way you can get more ammo for a weapon without a max ammo is if you Pack-a-punch a wall weapon and can purchase more ammo off of the wall (4500 points). Besides the first 3 maps (Nacht der Untoten, Verruckt, and Shi No Numa) there is a Pack-a-punch located somewhere in every zombies map. Accessing the pack-a-punch is a different process for each map; one commonality is that each one requires the power to use. One final thing about the Pack-A-Punch: only upgrade your gun if your gun is powerful. Don't waste your money to upgrade a pistol as opposed to a ray gun. Just use common sense here.
Traps: Traps are a nice and inexpensive way of taking down hoards of zombies. They are included in Verruckt, Shi No Numa, Der Riese, Kino Der Toten, and Ascension. A few pointers about traps: 1. make sure you are on the right side of the trap. Always use the trap on the opposite side of the room, if you use the wrong trap, you cannot get to the other side of the trap without dying. You either go down that way or get mauled by the group of zombies behind you. Watch what you're doing. Also, traps are there to assist you win, not actually win. You can only use traps once and then they go away. You need to make sure that you have a weapon you can use to defend yourself from the zombies, otherwise the trap will only slow down your eventual defeat. And finally, you have to watch your cash when you use these traps. The traps are not that expensive (1000 points) but that starts to add up after a while, so money is something you need to watch when you have to rely on these traps.
Miscellaneous: For certain maps, the power may allow you to perform a certain function within the map. For example, in Ascension, you need the power to access the lunar landers throughout the map. Most importantly, you need to have the power on to access your perks!!!!

Start off with the first level.,
Take cover!,
Always reload.,
Stay by teammates.",How to Play Call of Duty 5 on Veteran Difficulty," The levels get harder as you go on, so start at the beginning.;
, Always use cover. One time, my teammates kept running in to try to take over the spot, and kept getting torn apart (literally) by a LMG. Do you want to end up like them?

, Never, I repeat, NEVER go into an open battlefield with a half empty clip. You'll get torn up as you say, ""WTF? Why did my guy reload.

, Try using Sgt. Reznov, or Sgt. Roebuck for cover. They can take infinite bullets. Beware though, sometimes they fall and would leave you wide open! Plus, they will protect you against banzai people so have fun.

Set up a class for how you're going to play, there are different types of Sniping.,
At the beginning of the game you don't want to rush the enemy by going to their spawn point at the beginning - you'll just get yourself killed.,
Once you see someone, take your time to shoot them, especially if you're new to Sniping, It doesn't matter if you get more deaths than kills, practice makes perfect.

,
Most people use the Intervention or Barrett because these guns are powerful and help get one-hit kills.,
Play in Ground War or Team Death-match.,
If you come up against a more experienced sniper, leave the area.",How to Snipe in Modern Warfare 2," They are explained below. Make a class which you are comfortable with which means you need to experiment with the guns and perk combination's. A lot of people use the Intervention and Barrett 50. Cal. These guns are much easier to get kills with as they have more damage than the others. It is recommend trying these out first and as you get better at Sniping, you try out the WA2000 and M21 EBR.;
, Before the game started you should have had a rough idea of how you were going to play. You can run about Quick-Scoping, you can sit in cover picking off enemy's (Camping) or you can do what lots of people do which is sitting in an area for a few kills then moving to a new spot get a few kills and repeat.

,, But the other Sniper Rifles are still good to use, they are normally harder to use though as they have smaller multipliers (Damage to where the person is shot) so only use these if playing in Hardcore or you aim for the chest up.

, These put less pressure on you and let you practice sniping freely. More experienced snipers will often play all modes though. Another mode which is good for sniping is Domination, it gives you an objective to cover meaning you're more likely to get kills/kill-streaks.

, Don't try to counter-snipe until you are a semi-good sniper.

Set up a Private Match Lobby invite a couple of your friends and their friends as well.,
Put the game to TEAM DEATHMATCH with UNLIMITED SCORE and the time to 10 - 15 minutes (This was SURVIVORS will have a way to win).,
RULES!,
PERKS!,
The map...,
This is important, check your death streak.",How to Set Up a Modern Wafare 2 Zombie Match," Don't invite strangers (They may mess up your fun) and once you get at least 4 or 5 people here's how you set it up;
, Then put HEADSHOT ONLY with KILL STREAKS DISABLED. The health needs to stay under DOUBLE because it will then require 2 knife hits to kill and I don't think an angry zombie getting constantly owned for 4 minutes then finally reaching them then dying again and not getting a kill is going to make them very happy. Disable spectating for the sake of cheating.

, RULES! RULES! IMPORTANT! Zombies may only knife! NOTHING ELSE! No special grenades or throwing knives or even a tactical insertion, ANYTHING LIKE THAT DISABLED! Humans may use everything all except for light machine guns except for the AUG HBAR. Shotguns are up to the host as they are a Classical zombie weapon. But they are also as well have way too much ammo even without scavenger. Secondary Launchers and things like that are enabled. Also, Heartbeats and Thermal Optics are disabled.

, BLUE PERKS that are disabled: One Man Army and Scavenger. RED PERKS that are disabled: LIGHTWEIGHT (Even for zombies) as it creates an extremely unfair advantage for survivors. GREEN PERKS that are disabled: COMMANDO (Even for Survivors) because again it creates unfair advantage to either side.

, This is kind of important because the spawning is not like free for all. You spawn nearby the enemies. The spawning on TDM is over halfway across the map. if there is 18 people then choose a big map and not rust lol seriously. if it's just 4 people, maybe Karachi or Invasion. Possibly rust???

, Make sure it is only copycat.

Practice using Flash grenades on split screen.,
Know the appropriate area to throw a Flash grenade.,
Know how much Flash grenades roll and bounce.,
Rush in as soon as the Flash grenade goes off giving you a better chance of killing the enemy while they are blinded.

,
Use a Semtex grenade as soon as the Flash grenade goes off, because they will be blind and not able to see the grenade allowing you to move on to the next enemy, while they are killed by the Semtex grenade.

",How to Use Flash Grenades Effectively in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,";
, These areas are usually going to be in a building where most of your enemies are hiding, or the bunker on Afghan, or the airplane on Terminal.

, It is ideal to know this for two reasons...


Knowing this will enable you to get the grenade right next to you enemy.
This will let you get the grenade greater distances, with better accuracy.

The 2 Platinum Rules of Modern Warfare 2: Be faster then the enemy and always use cover to your advantage.

",How to Play Modern Warfare 2 Online Effectively," Do they accompany each other? Or are they sort of the same type of weapon? (M4A1 and the PP2000 for Ex.) You want something that will accompany each other. Since you're running and gunning you'll probably want a Shotgun (Silencers are Highly not recommended on them)because you are close range and shotguns are the king of close quarters and a SMG. Why sacrifice the accuracy? Well you're running and gunning enemies and Close-Quarters. AR's will not have the speed (Expect for a F2000) to take down an enemy as quickly. As for example a P90. Good damage with high firerate. It can outgun a TAR-21 possibly.;
, Again does it accompany each other or do the same thing? For the Primary Grenades it is recommended to use Semtax. It has the most throwing range and detonates quickly. The Secondary Grenades are your choice. Try a FLASHBANG because if your about to clear a building, a flashbang will blind them. Giving you over 50% chance of clearing it out rather then just rushing in.


What are your perks? This is important because this greatly affects your type of strategy you're doing. Running And Gunning. So we're going to need Marathon obviously because your running at nearly all times. Lightweight or Stopping Power. Stopping power greatly increases chances of dropping an enemy a lot faster then they can. WARNING: You are at a disadvantage without Stopping Power as they may most-likely have it. Your pick though.

, know the map well enough to know where the enemy is coming from and where they will possibly spawn next and also what routes you can use to ""Run and Gun""

,"
"
Use the perks Sleight of hand pro, Stopping power and Steady aim pro.,
Aim for the chest or head.,
Keep shooting!,
Don't constantly reload.",How to Snipe With the Barrett in Modern Warfare 2," These are essential when sniping.;
, The Barrett has the same power as the intervention and these areas will be a one-hit kill, even without Stopping power.

, The Barrett isn't hindered by a bolt action system like on the Intervention so you can get a second or third shot downrange instantly, but don't forget about the recoil.

, The Barrett has a 10-round magazine, twice the size of the intervention. Also, the reload time is slightly shorter.

Throw it near an inconspicuous place where the enemy is unlikely to notice it.,
Always be in the vicinity.,
Get in, get out.,
Move Fast.,
Use it to go offensive against campers.Campers are creatures of habit.",How to Use C4 in Modern Warfare 2," In the heat of battle, an enemy scrambling to set a charge is unlikely to notice the explosive pack. Sometimes you can get away with placing it on the objective, however, many people will fire at the objective blindly, setting your explosive off prematurely. Place it on a wall or on the ground adjacent, but close, to the objective.;
, The game announcer will let you know if someone is taking Position Alpha, and therefore giving you time to let the enemy have it, however, if your C4 fails, you always have the chance to kill weakened enemies.

, The longer you stay near the objective, the more likely your to get killed. Obviously, don't plant C4 right next to an enemy, as they will promptly kill you without remorse.

, C4 does not always have to be used offensively. With the Marathon, Danger Close, and Light Weight perks, you can throw C4 at an approaching enemy, and stand back to watch the fire works.

, They always return to the same place twice. Put C4 in a highly camped spot (Such as the Overwatch Ridge in Afghan) and wait for targets to pass by. If you're lucky, you could get the whole entire team in one spot.

Start the foray into multiplayer mode in Modern Warfare with the Free-For-All game mode.,
Choose your strategy.,
Go to this link for a video of someone playing Free-for-All: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BgdKeqp62M

",How to Play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Multiplayer Modes2,"


In this mode, every player is on his or her own team and is trying to win by becoming the first one to 30 kills or having the most kills by the end of the 10 minute match time limit.
In this mode, every player spawns in a different place on the map and after the 10 second countdown, the hunt is on!;
, There are usually two strategies employed in this game mode. The first is to be a ""camper,"" which means to find a safe spot on the map and just wait till other players come by to shoot them. This strategy helps the player accumulate keystrokes over time as the chances of an enemy spotting you before you spot them are low. However, the drawback would be that the player might spend a lot of time just waiting for other players, hindering his or her efforts at accumulating kills fast.


The second strategy is to a ""run-and-gunner."" This strategy involves the player running around the map as much as possible trying to find many other players to accumulate kills quickly. The drawback is that the player might be much easier to spot, which can prevent the acquiring of killstreak rewards. In the video above, we can see a player playing as a sniper and running around as much as possible trying to find other players and accumulate kills. We also see the player earning a UAV (radar) for getting a three killstreak without dying.

,"
"
First, we looked at the Free-For-All game mode, in which every player is on his own team trying to accumulate as many kills as possible.,
Go to this link for a video on someone playing Domination: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6iJiDZcOFU&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL

",How to Play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Multiplayer Modes3," Now, we will look at Domination. Domination is sort of like ""Capture the Flag."" In this mode, there are two teams and three checkpoints on the map. When a person dies, they can respond instantly. To earn points, a team has to ""capture the flag"" by standing close to the checkpoint for a certain amount of time, and then holds it without letting the other team capture that point. For every 5 seconds that a team holds a checkpoint, they earn a point. A team wins by accumulating 200 total points. There are two strategies on how to approach this mode. One would be to try to run around and capture as many checkpoints as possible for your team without worrying about killing the enemy team members. This can help your team dominate the checkpoints and earn the points required to win. Another strategy would be to hide near a checkpoint that your team has already captured and wait for the enemy team to try to capture that checkpoint, and then kill the enemy team members. This can help your team prevent your captured checkpoints from been lost to the enemy. The video above shows a player who uses the first strategy of running around trying to capture all the flags for his team without worrying about killing and deaths. We can see that after his team capture flags, the points on the bottom right of the screen start going up every five seconds.

"
Choose your killstreaks carefully.,
Choose your class carefully.,
Practice constant vigilance.,
Always remember that your enemy can be anywhere at any time.,
Camp, camp, camp.,
Keep an eye out for the death symbol.,
When camping, stay very still.,
Don't be a sucker for 'gamer etiquette'.",How to Play Well at Modern Warfare 2's Search and Destroy," It is rare for anybody to achieve a 9 streak, so it is foolish to put on anything higher than a harrier strike. A lot of the time it is most rewarding to put on a 3, 4 and 5 streak combo, with care packages on large maps and instant streaks like the counter UAV on small maps. If it is a map without a lot of buildings, take Wasteland for example it would be smart to use killstreaks like precision airstrike harrier airstrike and sentry guns.

, In Search and Destroy, stealth is your best bet for success. For this reason a silencer is very helpful, as is a heartbeat sensor. Cold Blooded also comes in great handy when the enemy launches their UAV's; just be sure to stay away from your non-cold blooded teammates as they will give away your position. Ninja Pro is a lifesaver, particularly as most people realize that you will hear your enemy long before you see them in S&D. A very effective class to use is an ACR with a silencer and heartbeat sensor (the ACR has 100% accuracy) akimbo M9 Raffica's with silencers(for close encounters) combined with Bling Pro, Cold Blooded Pro and Ninja Pro.;
, In most MW2 gametypes it is not so important to pay attention to potential camping spots and exposed areas; if you die, then you can simply respawn and take revenge. In Search and Destroy, there is no such option. hug the walls whenever possible, crouch while moving around to limit your own noise levels and don't constantly aim down your sights, as this limits your view range and reaction time.

, The introduction of the perks Lightweight and Marathon means that it is now possible for your team to be flanked in a round within the first 15 seconds. Never think that your position is foolproof and secure; the likelihood is that you will be in for a rude awakening. Again, constant vigilance is the key.

, The majority of the time, a Search and Destroy round is won by a very effective camper, usually a bomb defender. You might think that it sucks, but it works, mostly due to the no-respawn nature of S&D. An effective camping spot is never obvious, keeps your avatar's profile to a minimum and is not repeated in subsequent rounds.

, This is the small skull which appears above a teammate's location when they have died. the weapon that was used to kill them should also be paid attention to; if it's a sniper then the enemy is most likely nowhere near them, a knife means that the enemy is still around their location. Plan your actions accordingly.

, The first thing that most FPS players look for is enemy movement. This means that if you don't move, you will be completely invisible at first glance. It will surprise you how easily you can blend in to long grass and get the jump on unaware enemies at very close range, particularly if you have a ghillie suit on. This is the principle used behind the ninja defuse, which you can see multiple examples of on Youtube.

, This point applies to most gametypes but is particularly poignant in Search and Destroy. If you find a tactic that works, stick with it, no matter how annoying it is. Nowadays a lot of people consider conventional sniper use, or 'hard-scoping,' nooby, instead favoring the quick-scoping approach. The same is said of camping and the use of a heartbeat sensor. These 'rules' are only ever invented by people too stupid to find ways to beat them. If you want to run around with akimbo model 1887s, that is your choice; don't let anybody tell you otherwise!

Go prone if there is more than one person, this will increase your chances of not only surviving but killing your targets, because when you are crouched/prone your cross hairs are tighter.

",How to Get Lots of Kills in Modern Warfare 2,"


Choose a weapon you are comfortable with, remember everyone has different skill level, and is more comfortable with different guns than you so you have to find a gun that works for you

Use which ever special grenade you want, stun grenades recommended, as they throw quicker than flashbangs or smokes.
Select Semtex, or Claymores, Semtex is the best grenade if you are attacking, Claymores are the best for Camping.
Use a Shotgun, these are the backbone of most good classes, avoid pistols.
Select your perks, these recommended for a beginner:

Scavenger (If you are going to camp)
Marathon (If you are rushing)
Sleight of Hand (For snipers)


Perk 2:

Cold Blooded (On one class, for their killstreaks)
Lightweight (For rushing)


Perk 3:

Ninja (Camping/Cold blooded class)
SitRep (Good for rushing, you can see Claymores)

",How to Get a Tactical Nuke in Modern Warfare 2," Getting the nuke is pretty hard at first, especially when you're a beginner, but all you need to do is be defensive. It's not camping, camping is when you stay in one place and wait for your enemies. being defensive is more of like being stealth or a ""ninja"".

, Once you get the Harrier, don't start running around. You have to stay away from your teammates. Just stay in one place and let the Harrier do the work until you get the Chopper Gunner.

, If you're exposed, you will be killed, especially when the other team has a UAV. If you want, use a silencer or the Cold Blooded perk.

, Many teams stay in one area and that is not the right thing to do when you're trying to get a nuke. You have to stay away from your team and be stealth. That's the best strategy.

, Once you get the Chopper Gunner in Wasteland, you will have a Nuke, unless the team have the guts to take out the gunship.

, You don't need to camp, where you stay in one place. You have to move around, stay away from your team, and be stealthy.

, Nobody likes a trash talker.

Find a Primary weapon you are comfortable with.,
Find a Secondary gun.,
Equipment.,
Special grenade.,
Perk number one.,
Perk 2.,
Perk 3.,
Death Streak.",How to Create a Good Class in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2," This is, of course, the first step. If you don't have a good primary weapon you use, how will you ever do good? First, you have to figure out if you want to use an assault rifle (AR), a Submachine Gun (SMG), a Light Machine Gun (LMG), a Sniper Rifle, or a Riot Shield.


Assault rifles are great in Modern Warfare 2, making them all-around guns at any distance. When choosing an AR, you must decide between fully automatic, semi-automatic, and three-round burst. Burst fire is 3 bullet shot for each pull of the trigger. Semi automatic is one shot ever time you pull the trigger. The only 2 burst fire primary guns are M16 and FAMAS. The only semi-automatic gun is the FAL. When choosing a fully automatic weapon, be sure to look at the stats of the gun. Some of the guns have low power, and some have low accuracy. Look and see what you prefer.
Submachine Guns are a great choice for rushing and CQB. The rate of fire is very high, with decent power. Once again, look at the stats and test out the guns to see which is right for you.
Light Machine Guns are guns that usually have a high magazine capacity. In Modern Warfare 2, when looking at the stats, look and see how some may have more ammo, more stopping power, more accuracy, or a higher rate of fire. LMG's aren't used very often but are great for taking out many enemies without needing to reload.
Sniper Rifles are self explanatory, but I separated them into two categories. Higher power, and lower recoil. The Barret .50 Cal and the Intervention fall into the first category, where you can get a one-shot kill almost always from the stomach and up. The Intervention has a bit less power than the .50 Cal, but is more accurate. The .50 Cal is semi-automatic, unlike the bolt-action Intervention. It also has 10 bullets in a magazine, compared to the Intervention's 5. The second category is comprised of the WA2000 and the M21 EBR. The WA2000 is very balanced with low recoil and medium power. The M21 EBR has very low recoil and lower power. While the .50 Cal has a very high rate of fire, the recoil makes shooting more than one shot useless. However, with the WA2000 and the M21, shooting two shots at a time is no problem. Despite having low power, getting one-shot kills with these guns is not impossible, but the area is smaller. Mid-chest and up will snag you a One-Shot Kill.
The Riot Shield can work or not work for you. It's great for absorbing shots while your team mates pick off the enemies. You can also melee with the shield, but it takes two hits to drop an enemy (unless playing Hardcore modes which means it is one).;
, You have four categories to choose from: Machine Pistols, Handguns, Shotguns, and Launchers.


Machine pistols work well for close to medium range, acting like a slightly downgraded SMG.
Handguns come with the unique ability to quick-draw or pull your secondary weapon out very quickly. These handguns can be separated into the lower-power M9 and USP .45, and the high-power .44 Magnum and Desert Eagle. The Magnum and Desert Eagle come with high power, but sacrifice magazine size and accuracy, and vice versa.
Shotguns provide high power at the risk of sacrificing range (sometimes you get Medium-Long range kills though).
Launchers provide large amounts of damage with a large radius. The thumper is a good replacement for the grenade launcher, if you opted for a different primary attachment. Stinger missiles are probably the best for taking down vehicles. Javelin can also lock on to vehicles, as well as lock on to areas of the map. The AT-4 can lock on, with lower power than the stinger and javelin, but can also be free fired accurately. The RPG comes with two rockets, and can only be free fired with varying accuracy. However, the blast radius on these are higher than that of the AT-4.

, Equipment are extra tools that will let your perform various tasks.


Frag grenades and semtex grenades can be tossed long distances. Semtex grenades can stick to any surface as well as other people, and have a short detonation time, which means they can only be thrown so far before exploding. Frag grenades (Three second fuse) can be tossed long distances if thrown cold, but they can also be cooked for quicker detonation, and can also ricochet off of surfaces, and roll down hills.
Throwing knives provide an instant kill and can be thrown long distances. These allow you to kill in style, but can also be picked up and re-used.
With the blast shield, you can take more explosion damage than you normally would. This may seem useless, but it CAN safe your life at times.
Tactical Insertions allow you to choose where you respawn next. This is a very useful tool when defending or attacking in an objective game such as demolition or sabotage. It's also useful for snipers if somebody happens to sneak up on you. Just respawn and take revenge!
Claymores are everybody's best friends. They can be left unmonitored and still get you a kill. For campers and snipers, these can watch your back for you. For anyone else, just stick one in a place where people normally run, and you'll get a free kill.
C4's are very useful in objective-based games. In domination, you can plant a C4 on a flag, and when the enemy team tries to capture it, just detonate it and get some kills. In search and destroy, demolition, and sabotage, just throw one next to a bomb, and if someone plants it (or tries to defuse it) just blow it up!

, Special grenades give you the upper-hand in any fire-fight.


Would you like to conceal yourself while planting a bomb, or capturing a flag? Grab a smoke grenade! These provide excellent cover while playing these objectives, and can also be used to maneuver around an area and flank an opponent.
Stuns and flash grenades can give you a strong advantage in any situation. Just pop one out and kill them!

, First Tier Perk


If you like to rush the enemy, or are looking to quick-plant a bomb, go with Marathon. The Pro version will allow you to climb over obstacles quicker.
Sleight of hand is great for anybody who has been killed while they were reloading. The Pro upgrade of this perk will give you the ability to ADS (Aim Down Sights) quicker.
Scavenger is good for those who are constantly running out of ammunition and equipment by picking up a small blue package from dead bodies. The Pro version is an equivalent of bandolier, which gives you more ammo to start with.
Bling will allow you to attach an additional attachment to your primary weapon. This could let you attach a helpful sight, a silencer, heartbeat sensor, or FMJ in a combination of two. The Pro upgrade lets you attach two attachments to your secondary weapon as well.
One Man Army is the final perk allowing you to switch classes without having to respawn. You can also use it to replenish ammo and equipment by switching to the exact same class. The Pro version switches classes faster (From 5 seconds down to 3).

, Second Tier Perk


Stopping Power is a great perk that will work great for you if you're playing a Core game. It will let you kill enemies quicker and with less ammo. The Pro version lets your bullets do more damage against vehicles.
Lightweight lets you move faster while walking or sprinting. The Pro version allows you to pull your weapon out quicker after sprinting, making it a must for any rusher.
Hardline is for those the people who want to get Kill Streak rewards quicker, you need one less kill to get a kill streak reward, for example; To get a Chopper Gunner it will take 10 kills instead of 11. The Pro version makes your death streaks take one less death.
Cold-Blooded is a great perk, hiding you from UAV, air support, Sentry Guns, and thermal sights. When using the Pro version, the enemy will not see your name, nor will their crosshairs turn red when looking at you.
Danger Close will make your explosives do more damage and have a larger splash radius. The positives are self explanatory. The Pro version makes your kill streaks do more damage. Which means your choppers, harriers, air strikes and AC-130s will do more damage.

, Third Tier Perk


Commando allows you to melee from distances that would normally be out-of-reach. The knife attack takes very little time, as your opponent will only see you teleport at them (it's still possible to be killed whilst 'lunging'). The Pro version of this lets you jump off high places without taking any fall damage (unless outside the map).
Steady Aim increases your hip fire accuracy, helping if you don't have time to ADS (Aim Down Sights). The Pro version lets you hold your breath longer while sniping or looking down a thermal scope. This will help if you need more time to line up a good shot.
Ninja will keep you from showing up on enemy heartbeat sensors. The Pro version will make your footsteps 4x quieter, making them you very hard to hear.
Sitrep will give you the ability to detect enemy equipment. They will appear bright red and can be seen through many walls. The Pro version makes enemy footsteps 4x louder (unless they have Ninja Pro on).
Last Stand is well known to anybody that has played a Call of Duty game. This will let you pull out a handgun after dying until you are killed or you bleed out. The Pro version allows you to use equipment and special grenades while in last stand.

, A death streak helps you when you're not on top of your game. After dying a few times in a row, you can earn one of these.


Painkiller will give you 3x as much health for 10 seconds. This can give you an advantage and save your life at times.
Copycat lets you steal your killer's loadout.
Martyrdom makes you drop a live frag grenade after death.
Final Stand lets you go into last stand with your primary weapon. After a while in Final Stand, you will get back up after a while (if you are not killed first) and can continue playing, but will not go into Final Stand again.

, Go to a safe area where you can see most of the sky. Assuming the enemy has a UAV in the air, look up at around 45 degree angle you should see a small black or white drone. This should be the enemy's UAV.

, Equip your launcher if you haven't already. Look down the sight at the UAV. You will hear a steady beeping noise. When the steady beep changes to a constant tone, it means that you are locked on and ready to fire.

Use Equipment.",How to Be Good at Modern Warfare 2," Basic movement is conducted with your left analog stick. While standing, you will be moving at your fastest possible speed, without sprinting of course. But keep in mind you will be more exposed to the enemy. When crouching, you will be moving a bit slower, but you will not be as exposed to gunfire, and your accuracy improves. When prone you will be at your slowest, but your accuracy will be at it's highest and you will be the least exposed to gunfire. Sprinting is a good way of rushing an enemy or a position. But, your weapon will not be available.;
, Equip commando pro. Sprint towards your target. Be sure to aim at your target. Often, they will drop to the ground, so be prepared to quickly aim downwards. If you're following your target, waiting for the right moment to knife him, be sure to time your knife right. Otherwise you'll miss and chances are you will get shot by some other player watching you.

, Try setting your sensitivity to 7. Sure, you can still kill an enemy without decent aim, but you will use a whole clip while you're at it. Make every shot count. Move your sight on the enemy.

, It may not seem important at first, but after you play for a while you seem to know where your favorite spots are but what you need to know is where everyone else's spots are! Know the shortest routes, best hiding spots, and lastly the most used and least used entrances. Know this and make your own choices.

, Many Players fall with all of their equipment, equipment is vital to a successful kill-streak especially when you're in a tough spot if not use it right away, if a flash or stun are throw correctly you might even get an extra 20+, claymores and c4s's are also great alternatives for sniper/long range protection.

"
First, bring up your sniper rifle and run out the front door of the boathouse.,
Take your sniper rifle and run over to (and to the rear of) a large log pile located to the right rear of the boathouse.,
From the log pile, move out from the left towards the first small hill right in front of you (with three-sectioned white fence).,
Race inside the open doors of the main house and watch out for another bad guy inside.,
Take your WA2000 back out to the left of the main house and slowly slice the pie from left to right.,
Move slowly and be careful on this side as the guys here are hidden by brush and trees.,
Take the WA2000 and go back towards the armory, but instead of going into the armory doorway, take the NEXT left and it's a short hallway with a laundry room.,
Switch back to your automatic weapon and make your way up the stairs.,
After clearing the guys in the kitchen, make your way to the back of the house.,
As you get down to single digit hostile numbers, beware of more juggernauts.",How to Complete Estate Takedown on Veteran Solo," This will 9 times out of 10, bring out the first juggernaut. He will come down the hill between the main house and the boathouse. Kill him with your sniper rifle, and if you have trouble, just remember that flash-bangs stun juggernauts and can buy you some time. After this first juggernaut, there may be some stragglers that come down the hill as well and hide behind the trees. Take these guys out first.;
, This will provide you with cover as you ""slice the pie"" around each side of the log pile. First, with your sniper rifle zoomed in, slice the left side (do this SLOWLY as bad guys will fire on you as soon as they catch a glimpse of you) from your far left to right.


There is sometimes a bad guy to the right side of the house near the rolled-up garden hose and a pillar that holds up the back deck. He will pop his head up momentarily so when you get a chance, shoot him. If, after a few seconds of watching the base of that pillar, you don't see anyone popping their head up, then he isn't there.
Continue slicing from left to right on the left side of the log pile. You will slowly slice until you see the white fence end and a farmhouse begin. At this point, it's easier to switch to the right side of the log pile and begin slicing from right to left.
Usually, the only bad guy is a sniper in the far distance. You can locate him by ""turkey peeking"" (sticking your head out quickly, then returning to cover behind the log pile). This method will help you locate the muzzle flash or the glint of sunlight off the enemy sniper's scope. Once you've located his position, you will notice that 9 times out of 10, he is beneath the red and white electrical tower, near the ground.
Specifically, if you follow the left red leg of the tower down towards the ground, it will eventually cross with a white tree with a bush to the left of the tree. If you fire along the top of the grass, you can usually hit him in the head (you will know because your hostile count will reduce by one).

, Get down, and as you watch your map, you can locate more bad guys.


By turkey peeking as you did before, or by using only your map, get the location of the bad guys and scope in on them. Usually there are 2, sometimes only one. One of them is kneeling and moving out from cover then right back again. Watch where he rolls back to and you can fire your .50 cal through the fence he hides behind for another kill.

, Sometimes he's there and sometimes he's not. You can also pause outside before rushing in and clear the room from outside by aiming through the window, but he may be in the hallway, so just be prepared. Run into the armory and pick out one the WA2000 with thermal scope. This makes finding the enemies out in the woods much easier.

, Do this slow enough and the enemy won't even know you're there until you've shot one of them. You'll come across an open area below with a solar panel array. There will be several bad guys here. After clearing this side of the house, go to the right side.

, The spawning of the bad guys are also random on this side and they are deadly accurate. Using the WA2000 with the thermal scope helps somewhat, but it can't see through the brush very well.

, There is a bad guy to the left and up near the grass line. Be careful on this area, as well because the guys are hard to locate. Once you've cleared this area, head back inside the basement. If you want, set a claymore at each entrance to cover your back.

, When you get near the top, slow down and crouch. The snipers outside can see you walk by the windows and they will shoot at you.


As you near the top, aim towards the front door and entryway of the house. If there isn't a guy behind the wall then be patient. Some guys will come in from outside and run past your aim point. As you make your way into the kitchen area, be cautious when slicing to the right because there MAY be a bad guy facing the stairway where you are and he's right in the middle of the kitchen. Sometimes he's there and sometimes not. Sometimes there's a guy all the way to the left of the doorway, inside the kitchen.

, Watch out for a possible bad guy in the back room of the bottom floor. As you begin to exit the back room, head towards the front room, clearing bad guys as you go. Watch out for bad guys gathering outside the front door. Now head upstairs and clear out both rooms.


Sometimes there is a bad guy in the room to the right in the back left corner. You can snipe from the second story if you want, but remember that if you hear the bass sound of an incoming juggernaut, it will take longer to head out to the boathouse.
Clear the house and setting claymores, then going back outside to clear the hostiles from the ground. This way you have an advantage when the juggernauts come.

, Head to the back of the house and place claymores behind trees where you have seen hostiles hide earlier in the level. Once you reach 5 guys or less, the strategy of the enemy changes from ""wait and see"" to ""attack"". At this point, it is best to be at the back of the house and near the boathouse. This gives you an open area to work with.


As the hostiles begin to advance on your position, hopefully they will walk right into the claymores you have laid. When you get down to 2 or 3 left, you will hear one last juggernaut. Hopefully he will walk into a claymore or 2 and when he is stunned, you can fire on him multiple times with your .50 cal. Once he is dead, you've completed the mission!

",How to Be a Good Sniper in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2," The Barrett 50 Cal. has a large amount of recoil after each shot which makes missing your target deadly as the high recoil will make you lose sight of the target. The Intervention has the same damage as the Barret, but it has half as many bullets in the default magazine and is bolt-action which makes your rate of fire slow down and makes this weapon have to be one-shot-kill otherwise your enemy will have enough time to aim at you and kill you. The WA2000 is semi-automatic like the Barrett but has less recoil, less damage and a smaller clip than the Barett (6 bullets compared to the Barrett's 10). It is capable of acquiring one-shot-kills to the upper chest, neck and head. Note that stopping power actually has NO effect on the one-shot-kill ability of this weapon, so your Tier 2 perk is free for a different perk. The M21 EBR is the lowest damage sniper rifle, being only one shot kill to the head or neck but it has the least recoil. The M21 EBR is effectively a ""double-tap"" weapon, where in most scenarios, two shots will be required to dispatch your target. Most players familiar with the gun will quickly send two shots at the target, this made easier by the low recoil of the weapon. Its magazine size is ten rounds, same as the Barett.;
, The silencer keeps your shots quiet, but it sacrifices a bit of power, requiring two hits, unless to the head, or in a hardcore game, if you use Stopping Power. The ACOG scope makes your rifle suitable for CQB situations but is otherwise used to unlock the thermal scope. The heartbeat sensor is a great attachment to have, to make sure no one is rushing your position. The Thermal Scope is the most widely used attachment and makes your enemies clearly glow hot-white against a grey backdrop, but it's not as crystal clear as you'd like it to be. FMJ adds more bullet penetration to your gun. Extended mags, does just what the name describes, it gives you a magazine with more rounds in it.

, Stopping Power will make your rifle much more powerful (and is the only way to get a one shot kill with a silenced sniper rifle in a core game). However, Cold Blooded may be more useful, as enemy snipers who use the Thermal Scope will have trouble seeing you. Bling will give you two attachments. However, Sleight of Hand may be preferred for quickly reloads, or Scavenger to get magazines from dead bodies. Last, you may want Steady Aim, as it will increase no scope accuracy and can increase the amount of time you can steady your scope. But, you may want Ninja, as it will make Heartbeat sensors useless, so they will have trouble finding you.

, Having that done, try to stay as low as possible, but still have a sight of what is going on. A good hiding place will give you a broad view of the battlefield, provide cover and at least partially hide you. Good examples of the include: The houses on the edge of the map in Wasteland, The Houses in the middle of the map in Rundown, The brick house in the south of Favela,the cockpit of the plane in Terminal, The cliff behind the C-130 in Afghan, The bunkers in Afghan and the large offices in Derail, among others.

, This means you will have a higher chance of hitting your target. Aim for this spot if you want a higher chance of killing someone. If possible, hit near the neck.

, If the person is in a standing position, you want to aim for the head if possible; if done correctly, you will get extra points and a one shot kill.

, If the person is running from A to B. You always want the scope (Bulls Eye) to be ahead of him, not so much in front, but keep your space. The mere instant (because weapons have infinite velocity) the person gets into your sights, light 'em up!

, Also, claymores are imperative. Set a claymore on each opening where an enemy can enter. Try to hide it, so he can't see it, leading to death.

, (Hard-scoping, for those of you who don't know, is when you just stay aimed down the sight of your rifle.) You have to learn to spot people while not scoped in, then scope in on where they are. This will make you much more aware of what is going on around you and less likely to die from being rushed.

Run and shoot.,
Aim above your enemy.,
After you've killed your enemy, be sure to go pick up the knife, cause you can reuse it again to kill another opponent.

",How to Shoot a Ballistic Knife on Call of Duty: Black Ops," So the aiming ability is really different that other weapons. Due to this weapon is a knife (not a gun) and cause the aim sight is smaller than others. So your aim needs to be precise. Just having someone in the middle of the target doesn't guarantee a kill.;
, Whenever the opportunity comes along that you get a chance to kill someone with the Ballistic, try to catch them running. Whenever you do actually for a kill, you'll then want to shoot a little ahead of them because they will run right into it.

, You can also try aiming above your enemy to have the knife drop when it flies out of the knife, so this will allow for a distanced kill.

Don’t go straight on-line.,
Do not camp with the M16.,
Keep moving at all times.,
Don’t blindly rush into rooms.,
Do not use the grenade launcher.,
Work with your team!,
Diving is the stupidest move you can make, go prone or crouch for more accuracy.,
Do not use the RPG.,
Don’t try to quick scope.,
If you find someone that is camping, look around for a Tactical Insertion, because chances are if you kill them they are going to respawn and kill you.

Don't spend the money on the Ballistic Knife or the Crossbow, they would be a waste of a secondary weapon.,
Make sure your Killstreaks are within your skill level!",How to Raise Your KDR in Call of Duty: Black Ops," It usually helps to play against Bots, on normal difficulty. This gives you time to find out what guns you are the most comfortable using, and what attachments and perks you should use. When you start winning frequently, make the settings harder, put it on hardened and after that veteran, because the bots are more harsh and skilled than any human player. This will make you think and sharpens your reflexes.;
, This does not work. The best you can do with it is to move constantly. In the beginning levels try to use the MP5k.(Note: the MP5k has a high rate of fire, is very accurate, and works very well.)

, Check your corners and keep an eye on your radar. NOTE: Radar is your best friend, use it. It tells you where all the enemies are!

, Try checking your corners and using flash, concussion and even the smoke grenades, but save your lethal. Even the Willy Pete smoke grenade causes a small amount of damage to your enemies when it lands close to them.

, Most of the time it gets you killed because you have to try to line up the shot and account for distance. It's a sneak weapon, not a frontal assault weapon.

, Team work is essential. It also gives your enemies someone other than you to shoot at, increasing your chances of survival.

, Diving makes you a target to enemies, because you cannot fire during the diving phase.

, This is a waste of a secondary weapon. Use Scavenger, so you don't run out of ammo for your primary.

, This is a waste of time because it is extremely inaccurate, and gets you killed if you happen to miss the first shot or it doesn't kill the enemy.

,, Feel free to use them in private matches, but don't use them on-line because they do not stand up to machine gun fire, and take longer to travel.

, If they are not, then that can possibly hurt your KDR. When starting out it is a good idea to use the Spy Plane, Care Package, and the Sentry Gun or the Mortar Strike.

Become a sniper.,
Follow the same rules as in the other CoD games.,
As for weapons, starting out you have to go through two Semi-Automatic rifles before you can go to a Bolt-Action rifle.,
Learn about Sniping In General.,
Know about the Scoring.",How to Snipe on Call of Duty: Black Ops," The good thing about Black Ops is that there has been a drastic drop in count of snipers. The majority of players you'll meet online will be a ground player. So this can give you a small advantage, because you'll most likely be the only sniper in the game you're in.;
, The same moves and measures you sniped on MW2, WOW, and MW still apply. Nothing about the scope, shooting, or anything has changed whatsoever.

, The first is the Dragonuv, then WA2000. Then you'll go onto more advanced rifles, but they're bolt action which makes them easier to hit enemies with. The third rifle is the one you want to go for.

, Sniping overall isn't something for everyone. Some people get bored easily which can come with being a sniper (due to the laying around, and non-mobility. But whenever you get kills, it'll all be worth it. So positioning is a key factor here. You want to lie somewhere that is not easy to be seen in, preferably off the ground and has small holes in the bordering and sheltering so no one can shoot you easily. But if you're on the ground, then don't be afraid to lie on the ground. Sometimes, enemies will think you're a dead body. But if you are on the ground, you need the right camouflage to match the ground. I.E.: Arctic Level: Arctic Camo. Then it's all focus from there. When someone walks by you, pull the trigger (but don't assume an auto kill, you might miss and or just hurt them).

, Now starting off, sniping can be tricky and you'll wind up with fewer kills than the average ground players, but usually with fewer deaths which means a higher KTD(kill to death) ratio which can impress higher ranked players. But as you can become better, you'll go on to getting twenty,thirty, even forty kills a match! And with zero deaths!

Practice the timing of raising the scope.,
Get familiar with the center of your screen.,
Know the maps.,
Adjust your aiming sensitivity.,
Create a quick scope loadout.,
Play with bots.,
Lead your target.,
Stop moving when you shoot.,
Get into cover between shots.,
Switch to secondary when outnumbered.,
Keep practicing.",How to Quick Scope in Black Ops 2," Perform this motion over and over again until you start to get a feel for how long it takes for the scope to appear on your screen. This is the most important aspect of quick scoping, because it is all about timing. If you pull the trigger too early, you won’t get the accuracy benefits of the scope, and if you pull the trigger too late it’s no longer quick scoping.;
, It is important to know where your scope’s crosshair will appear. When you don’t have the scope up, your crosshairs are very wide apart. When you raise the scope, the crosshairs will appear directly in the middle of your screen. Learn where that is by practicing constantly so that you know exactly where your crosshairs will appear.

, You’ll be most effective quick scoping by knowing where your opponents are going to be. Get to know each map and all of the chokepoints. Know how long it takes for the enemies to get somewhere after they spawn.

, Many pros recommend setting your sensitivity between 9-13. If the sensitivity is too low, you won’t be able to track your targets, while if it too high you will have difficulty keeping your crosshair steady. Play around with the settings to find a sensitivity that suits your playstyle well.

, To be most effective at quick scoping, you will need to set your loadout to give you the maximum advantage. This includes your perks and your weapons. Try the following loadout, and tweak it to your preferences:


Weapon: DSR 50 or Ballista (1-hit kill above waist or chest respectively). These bolt-action sniper rifles are the only weapons that you can really quick scope with. Both are 1-hit kill if you aim correctly. The DSR 50 is the most popular, as it has the largest area it can hit and kill.
Attachment: Ballistics CPU – Lowers the sway of your scope when you zoom in. This will make it much easier to shoot where you are aiming quickly. This is pretty much essential for quick scoping.
Perk 1: Ghost – Can’t be detected by enemy UAVs.
Perk 2: Fast Hands – Quick weapon switch. This will let you pull out your sidearm quickly if you find yourself surrounded.
Perk 3: Dexterity – Aim faster after sprinting. Since you should always be moving, having this perk will let you quickly take shots while on the run.

, Set up a private match with bots as your opponent. These are computer controlled players that will give you lots of practice for aiming against moving targets. Set them on an easy difficulty, but place as many as you can on the opposing team. This will give you plenty of opportunities to try to hit moving targets without them killing you all the time.


Practicing against bots will help keep your stats from taking a negative hit while practicing.

, If your target is moving, start scoping in a little in front of them. This will put them directly in your sights once the scope is completely raised.

, While you should constantly be moving between shots, you need to stop moving for the split second that you take the shot. This will ensure that your accuracy is not penalized for moving while shooting. Start moving again immediately after the shot is fired.

, Since the fire rate for sniper rifles is so low, you will be exposed and vulnerable between shots. Make sure that you are near cover, and duck behind it while you work the bolt action and prepare your next shot.

, Don’t be afraid to abandon your quick scoping when you are faced with multiple immediate threats. Instead, switch to your secondary weapon to scatter your enemies and retreat and regroup to begin quick scoping again.

, Quick scoping is based entirely on feel. It is a skill, and will take time to learn and even more time to master. Keep practicing with bots until you start to get more comfortable, and then take your new skills online against human opponents.

Master your knowledge of the Assault Rifles.,
Use Assault Rifles effectively.,
Master your knowledge of the Marksman Rifles.,
Use Marksman Rifles effectively.,
Master your knowledge of the Sniper Rifles.,
Use Sniper Rifles effectively.",How to Use Rifles in Call of Duty Ghosts," Assault rifles are among the most used weapons, not only in CoD Ghosts but throughout the CoD franchise. They are well-rounded, flexible, and best used in mid-range firefights. Most certainly, these weapons are easy to use and beginner-friendly, too. As per the in-game descriptions, the assault rifles are:


SC-2010. Fully automatic. Redesigned barrel provides longer range with reduced recoil for higher accuracy.
SA-805. Fully automatic. Next generation modular weapon that is strong and versatile overall. Good range and accuracy.
AK-12. Fully automatic. Increased damage with an improved design for less recoil. Good damage and range.
FAD. Fully automatic. Highest rate of fire in its class, with moderate recoil, and average damage and range.
Remington R5. Fully automatic. High damage output and range combined with a reduced fire rate for stability.
MSBS. Three-Round burst allows for high damage output. Fast rate of fire in full auto.
Honey Badger. Fully automatic. Integrated Silencer keeps your shots off the radar.
ARX-160. Fully automatic. High rate of fire, reduced recoil for the first 3 rounds, and a Laser Sight for increased hip-fire accuracy.;
, There are various ways to effectively use assault rifles. It just all depends on how you use your weapon.


Moving around with an assault rifle is the best way to go. Keep your ammo full, keep track of your enemies, and start the hunt!
It is best equipped with Speed, Handling, and Stealth perks. When properly mixed, you can have yourself a stealthy killing machine.
Use attachments to enhance your weapon’s effectivity. You can add Foregrip for additional stability while firing. You can also add a Muzzle Break for an increase to the maximum effective range.
Use your radar to keep track of enemies especially when a Sat Com is in effect. Flank enemies at the edge of the map. Sneak your way up to the enemy and avoid attracting attention.
Raid in groups. Enemies will panic if they are ambushed so take this opportunity to eliminate some of them while they are in disarray. Remember, assault rifles are deadly in spraying multiple enemies.
Of all the assault rifles available, Honey Badger seems to be the best option, mostly because of its built-in silencer and decent damage rate. It is always best to go under the radar when eliminating enemies.

, Marksman rifles are popular because their range is at the middle of an assault and sniper rifles’ range. They deal a great deal of damage while you shoot from a safe distance, and with high accuracy, too. As per the in-game descriptions, the marksman rifles are:


IA-2: Semi-automatic. Strong and versatile overall.
MK14 EBR. Semi-automatic. Moderate recoil, highest damage per round in class.
MR-28. Semi-automatic. A built-in Foregrip lowers recoil. Shorter range with highest rate of fire in its class.
SVU. Semi-automatic. Effective at long range with moderate recoil.

, Since marksman rifles cater to short and long range shooting, it is important to know how you can use these weapons to their full potential.


When using marksman rifles, it is best to use the Stalker perk. It drastically makes your movement faster while aiming.
As for attachments, equip your weapon with a Force Grip for firing stability, just like the assault rifle. Depending on your play style, you can also attach a Burst Fire on your weapon to shoot bullets faster in just a single burst. With Force Grip attached, you don’t need to worry about as much recoil.
Most veteran players do quick-scoping, mainly because it’s a fast and effective way of killing an enemy even before it gets the chance to do anything. The IA-2 pulls off this move efficiently.
Try mixing the run-and-gun and sniper play-style when using a marksman rifle. This will confuse your enemies trying to figure out your pattern of play. Your weapon can be fatal regardless of your distance so you have the benefit of changing your pace.
When reaching a high-tier Kill Streak reward, it is advisable for you to play it safe first and wait for your final prey. Avoid roaming around to lessen the chances of you getting killed and cutting-off your Kill Streak.
Of all the marksman rifles on the list, the MK14 EBR boasts the most overall favorable stats. It may not provide the best mobility, but it sure deals the greatest damage. It could kill an enemy with one bullet to the head in a long distance shot.

, If you are into long range combat, then sniper rifles are the weapons that you should use. These weapons pact the highest damage, accuracy, and range of all the rifle classes in CoD Ghosts. As per the in-game descriptions, the sniper rifles are:


USR. Bolt-action. Deadly from waist up with faster handling. Recoil Compensator reduces kick with each kill.
L115. Bolt-action. Deadly from the knee up through center mass. Recoil Compensator reduces kick with each kill.
Lynx. Semi-automatic. Lower mobility, deadly from the knee up through center mass.
VKS. Semi-automatic. Integrated Silencer with highest ammo capacity and rate of fire in its class.

, There are certain techniques for how to become a pro sniper. Snipers are mostly independent players who kill at their own pace in their own space. That being said, it is important to know how to prepare yourself for the sniper role.


Use the Variable Zoom and Chrome Barrel attachments to put your damage, accuracy, and range at maximum. These are the attachments that are well-suited for ultra-long-range sniping.
Use Motion Sensor to be warned of enemies approaching. Snipers are usually immobile in a hidden spot so it is vital for you to know what’s happening in your blind spot.
Equip a burst secondary weapon just in case an enemy sneaks up on you from behind or you are forced to engage in a closed combat situation. Using a sniper rifle at close range is a no-no most of the time, unless your weapon is capable of quick-scoping like a marksman rifle.
Equip the Stealth perks so that your location won’t be revealed easily even if you land a killing shot. You may appear on the radar but with Ghost or Off the Grid perks, you are virtually invisible to the enemies.
Move away from the rest of your team mates and then find a well-hidden spot to camp from. From there, you can observe and wait until an enemy comes through your crosshair. After a kill, consider changing location so that the enemies will have a hard time searching for you.
L115 seems to be the best sniper rifle when it comes to overall performance. It extends its fatal shots from the knee up, thus giving it higher instant kill rate among its class.

Keep moving.",How to Quickscope in Call of Duty: Ghosts," The two best quickscoping sniper rifles are the L115 and the USR. If you are going to use the Sleight of Hand perk, utilize the Armor Piercing attachment. If you aren't going to use Sleight of Hand, utilize the Extended Mags attachment.


The L115 has better damage.
The USR has better accuracy and has good damage.;
, The following perks to quickscope can be helpful: Ready Up (quicker aiming after sprinting), Quickdraw (faster aiming), Sleight of Hand (faster reloading), Amplify (louder enemy footsteps)

, A good way to start is by doing what you might call 'speedscoping'. This is where you aim in so you can see down the scope and quickly lining up your target into the crosshairs.


Pull the trigger quickly after aiming in and don't be afraid of missing the mark when you're just starting out. Hold the aim button and quickly let it go, But as you stop aiming you have to shoot. If you are an advance player, you can combine quickscoping with reload cancels, trick shots, jump shots, and knife lunges. But if want to combine quickscoping with advance techniques, go to your options and put your sensitivity on from 10 to 15. Select which one fits you best.
Challenge yourself to aim quickly and you will be surprised how many times you hit the target.
Practice this in 'bots' games if you are worried about your kill/death ratio being affected.

, You don't need to play at sensitivity level 20 to be a great quickscoper, but the higher sensitivity will definitely help you in the long run.

, The way the game is designed, aiming in enhances the accuracy of your shot. The moment you begin to aim, your accuracy bonus in applied, even though you can't see exactly where the crosshairs are lined up as your scope is still focusing on the screen.


There is a trick you can utilize to help you learn where your quickscope shot will most likely hit. Aim in until you see the crosshairs of your sniper scope and put a tiny piece of tape on that spot on your television screen.
Use that as a marker while you're learning to quickscope.

, Even when you are great at quickscoping, you will still miss quite a few shots. It is important to be good at dodging your opponents' shots and taking cover between shots that you fire.


Always stay on the move between shots to make it difficult for your enemy to kill you.
Drop to the ground between shots or strafe back and forth to minimize their target while you reload.

Go into private mode and search for spots to hide.,
Be sure to know when you are vulnerable and when you can be seen.

Check all your surroundings before entering an area: check the tress, door ways, windows, and the ground.,

You can learn a lot from your teammates. If you are following them or watching them you may learn something.;

,, This will help in avoiding large amounts of enemies at once.

, they likely have an invincibility hack enabled or are invisible. You may just want to leave the match

, If it comes down to 2 vs. 2 there will very likely be someone that makes a round around the map searching for there target. So stay out, or you can move, but don't move in common areas.

Choose perk 1.,
Use Stopping Power as perk 2.,
Choose perk 3.,
Choose a pistol.",How to Snipe Effectively in Call of Duty: World at War1," Perk 1 really boils down to personal preference. However, Bazooka, Betties, and Flamethrower are all good ideas. Bazooka can be used to kill people behind walls and / or serve as an anti-tank weapon. Betties are popular due to the fact that they can protect you from being attacked through a certain passageway on the map. The flamethrower, despite being only available at level 65, provides a way to attack enemies at close range if you are in a tight situation.;
, Unless you can aim at the head consistently, use Stopping Power as perk 2 to increase the damage per bullet and thereby increase the chance of you killing the enemy when you shoot.

, For snipers, perk 3 is best equipped with Deep Impact or Steady Aim. Deep Impact allows you to shoot through certain walls / surfaces, which can be very useful if you know that the enemy is hiding in a very specific spot. However, if you usually shoot enemies that are out in the open and would like to increase your chances of getting kills from no scopes, Steady Aim is a decent choice.

, You should pick from any pistol but the Tokarev (the Tokarev has a bad reload time). All pistols, with exception of the Magnum, kill in 3 hits, but the only difference is reload time. The Nambu is the best in reload time, but the sights on the gun is slightly misaligned and therefore may cause accuracy problems. Because of this, the Walther, which has the 2nd best empty clip reload, or the Colt, with the 2nd best partial clip reload, may be the better choice for you. However, the Magnum is also a good idea once you have unlocked it. At close range, the Magnum kills in 2 hits. However, this comes at the expense of having the worst reload time of the pistols. Choose wisely when picking a pistol.

"
"
Decide whether you will attach a scope to your weapon or not.,
Consider the Springfield, Arisaka, Mosin-Nagant, and Kar98k.,
Consider the PTRS-41.,
Consider the M1 Garand.",How to Snipe Effectively in Call of Duty: World at War2," While most snipers use scopes, some choose to not use them. Sniper rifles with scopes have the advantage of not only doing more damage than an un-scoped weapon, but also have the liberty of seeing something far away with a scope. However, un-scoped weapons are more easily used in close range combat and do not have to be steadied when you aim them.

, In general, all of these weapons are as good as the other and work the same. They reload 5 bullets at once if not scoped, and 1 bullet at a time if scoped (the latter of which can be quite useful in heated combat). After firing 1 shot, they have to ""re-chamber"", or load a new bullet (which can disrupt aiming after firing). Also, the Arisaka, Mosin-Nagant, and Kar98k all have to have their respective scopes unlocked by killing with the weapon 25 times unscoped. NOTE: Using an un-scoped Springfield is not recommended due to the fact that the sights and the respective area of the bullet are misaligned; this makes the un-scoped Springfield somewhat difficult to aim.

, The PTRS is unlocked at a high level, but has many advantages over the previously mentioned sniper rifles. First off, it does not have to ""re-chamber""; all the bullets in one clip can be fired at a certain rate (faster than the previously mentioned sniper rifles) one after the other and the lack of a ""re-chamber"" means that it is somewhat easier to kill more than 1 person without going un-scoped. However, it also has two disadvantages: when reloading, you have to wait quite a bit to reload due to the fact that the PTRS reloads whole clips at a time, and you also cannot have the weapon un-scoped.

, The M1 is not a sniper under normal circumstances; however, if you manage to get the insanely high amount of kills needed to unlock a scope for it, you can use it as a sniper rifle. The M1 is semi-automatic, meaning that you can fire rounds from it rather quickly and use it quite effectively as a no scope sniper rifle. While scoped, it has less recoil than the previously mentioned weapons after it is fired, making it easy to shoot more than 1 person or shooting one person twice. It also has a total clip size of 8 instead of the usual 5 and has a larger ammo count. While overall a great choice, it does have the weakness of punishing you in terms of reload time for reloading with bullets already loaded into the gun.

"
"
Use the sights to maximize accuracy, and steady your aim if you are using a scoped weapon.,
Learn the maps and find ""sniper spots"".,
Aim at the head or the upper body for the best chance of killing.,
Use the radar to predict the enemy.,
Be prepared to use the pistol.,
If the game lags, or if you are a Wii player that is not hosting the game, ""lead"" your shots ahead of the opponent.,
Change sniper spots during the game frequently.,
Stay near your team during tight fights or enemy recon planes.,
Exchange the weapons of dead enemies with your pistol.,
Remember that you have your grenades.,
Also, remember to use your special grenades.",How to Snipe Effectively in Call of Duty: World at War3," This is the most basic requirement of sniping efficiently. If you fire from the hip, your bullet could go anywhere. When you fire from the sights, your accuracy is 100%. However, if you are using a scope, your sights will move around quite a bit and will affect your accuracy. This can be avoided by ""steadying"" your aim, which removes most of this movement. However, steadying can only be done for a few seconds and will completely screw up the movement on your sights if you steady for too long, so you should only stead when you know you can get a shot off someone. (Note: steadying does not apply to the Wii version; if you are a Wii player, see step 6)

, Sniping is difficult because you need to minimize your chances of being attacked at close range or being noticed. If you can find several points on the map where you can easily attack the enemy without being attacked yourself, you're in luck and have found a good ""sniper spot"". The best ""spots"" provide maximum attacking power in a given situation with minimal risk of death.

, Head-shots are always preferable, and are a guaranteed one hit kill, but are difficult to pull off on a moving opponent in the heat of battle. For this reason, you should aim at the upper body if you cannot aim at the head. You will need to aim at the head less if you have a scoped weapon because scoped weapons do more damage per hit and thus can kill in one hit if you shoot at the upper body. For this same reason, un-scoped weapons need to be aimed at the head more for a kill.

, As a sniper, you can get a general idea of where an enemy is headed if you look at the radar frequently. In addition, if you are using a scoped weapon and are scanning over a specific area, pull down the sights for a brief second and look at the radar to see if the conditions of the battle are changing.

, If you know an enemy is coming your way and is close (through looking at the radar, seeing him, or hearing his footsteps), switch to the pistol quickly and take him out.

, This is notably quite difficult, as people can't intuitively aim in lag, but you will have to do this if you hope to kill under these conditions.

, If you stay at one spot too long, people WILL notice and kill you quickly. Be mobile to prevent predictability.

, As a sniper, security and stealth are your primary concerns. If the enemy sees that you're alone, you're an easy target.

, They will most likely be very useful in close combat situations, and are overall more reliable than your pistol in terms of killing ability.

, Grenades can be very useful for tense combat situations or points in the game where you know that your opponent lurks behind a wall / object. If you have a regular frag, remember that you should hold down the button a bit before throwing it; this way, your opponent has very little time to react.

, A well placed smoke, tabun gas, or flare can prevent the enemy from approaching you without a great deal of risk on their behalf. Sometimes, the best approach is to run away or confuse the enemy to prevent yourself from dying.

Choose the right perks.,
Choose an appropriate class.,
Find your sweet spot.,
Choose the right weapon.,

Plan your kill streaks.,
Kill and move.",How to Camp in Call of Duty Ghosts," Camping means killing without being tracked down. That being said, you should equip your player with stealth perks in order to be an effective camper. Here are some of the most effective perks for camping:

Off the Grid. This perk makes you invisible to enemy SAT-COMs. This will make your location hidden even if they deploy SAT-COMs (which is supposed to give away your location on the radar).



 


Ghost is also a vital perk to be equipped, since it removes your name when an enemy’s crosshair passes you by.






After killing an unsuspecting enemy, their location will automatically show on the map. However, if you have the Takedown perk equipped, killing enemies will not reveal their death skull icons on the opposing team’s mini-map.





;
, Camping is usually associated with snipers. That is appropriate, as they are known for being stealthy assassins from afar. But how about stealthy “ninja” assassins? They operate at close distances and can also effectively kill by camping.

For a sniper class, make sure to equip the stealth perks mentioned so you will kill lots of enemies while staying hidden on the map.






For “ninja” campers, it is advisable to use a combination of Speed and Stealth perks. Make sure you have Stalker and Agility equipped for speed and Off the Grid and Dead Silence for stealth perks.







, Most of the maps in CoD Ghosts include debris and a lot of collapsible structures. Take advantage of those terrains to find your “sweet spot”. This is where you will hide from the enemy and shoot only once an enemy is in sight.

Hiding in the shadows is one effective way of camping. Usually you will do this in dark corners inside structures. Once an enemy passes you by, sneak from behind and go for the kill.






Go to high places, especially if you are a sniper. You will have a good vantage point from above and with this wide view, you can simply target moving enemies on the ground.






After you familiarize yourself with the maps, you will then notice the usual passage points of your enemies. Knowing these passages will make your camping easier. Just camp in an intersection and wait for the unsuspecting enemies to pass by.







, Since there are a few variations on camping, it is important for you to know which weapon is suited for your chosen camper type.

For snipers, obviously, sniper rifles are the way to go. Using the L115 seems to be a good option since it is capable of single fatal shot, depending on the distance.






For non-sniper campers, most of the agile ones use shotguns for those instant kills in close combat. The more experienced ones just use a pistol or knife to further improve their speed and agility on ground combat.







, While camping, you are immobile. These means that most of the time you are just steady in one location, patiently waiting for an enemy to pass your way. While doing so, using the right Lethals and Tacticals will surely protect you from unwanted attacks and threats.

I.E.D. is one type of lethal equipment that functions just like a claymore from previous COD games...only, it sticks anywhere (like C4) and explodes upon enemy contact. This can protect your back while you are focused in another direction.






Trophy System, on the other hand, is a type of tactical equipment that protects you from grenades and other throwable threats. It instantaneously destroys the first 2 enemy projectiles before self-destructing.

, As a camper, it is likely that you will land numerous numbers of kills. With this, you must be able to plan what kill streak rewards you would like to use to benefit your camping.

Guard Dogs are super effective in protecting you from enemies that are outside your peripheral vision. Dogs attack nearby enemies (even the ones that are hiding or camping).






I.M.S., just like I.E.D.’s, can be placed behind you so that you are safe from sneak attacks from the enemy. Unlike I.E.D.’s, I.M.S.'s can kill enemies multiple times as long as it is not destroyed.







, Although you are technically invisible on the map, you will still be shown on the enemies’ radar once you land a kill. Though camping may involve staying in one location, make sure to move once in a while to confuse the enemies as to where the kills are coming from.

Play Multiplayer.,
Rank up.,
Complete Field Orders.,
Accomplish Operations.",How to Get Squad Points in Call of Duty Ghosts," In order to get squad points, you must play online. You may have access to high-tiered weapons and perks in local game mode but those do not carry over to your online play experience.;
, Ranking up or leveling up in CoD Ghosts instantly awards you with 2 squad points. Surely, this is the fastest and easiest access to get squad points. The challenge here of course is for you to perform well during online combat situations.


Leveling up all the way to Level 60 gives you a total of 120 squad points.
It will be much easier for you to level up faster if you play with friends. They can definitely help you boost your level. Sometimes, some even hold private lobbies solely for boosting - which is prohibited.

, A new addition to CoD Ghosts is field orders. They are random blue briefcases with challenges that become available when eliminating an enemy. These challenges must then be completed in order for you to be awarded with a squad point.


Field orders are not really hard challenges. Some can easily be completed, such as getting a kill while using a picked-up weapon or simply killing an enemy from behind.
If you fail to complete a field order, you will lose the blue briefcase and it can now be acquired by the enemies.
Aside from gaining a squad point, you will also gain experience points (XP) and a random kill streak reward upon field operation challenge completion.
Once you get a hold of a blue briefcase, back-up a bit and adjust your play style for what the challenge asks of you. For example, if the challenge asks you to kill an enemy from behind, it’s better to be stealthy until you find your prey.

, Most of the CoD Ghosts players do not realize that accomplishing Operations (or so-called Challenges) is one of the most effective ways of earning squad points.


There are a lot of Operation challenges to choose from and some are really easy, such as sprinting 5 miles (8.0 km) using the Marathon perk. This literally means you can be awarded 1 squad point by just running around with the Marathon perk equipped.
The Operations change every 2 weeks and can be renewed early using 1 squad point.
Just like field orders, accomplishing operations will win you some XP.
Some operations may be class, perk, or weapon specific so make sure your class, perk and weapon is suited for the operation challenge you would like to accomplish.

Choose a sniper.,
Choose Attachments.,
Choose perks.",How to Pick the Perfect Sniper Class for Your Play Style on COD Ghosts1," If you are an aggressive sniper, try using the USR. The reason being is that you can get more feeds and/or kill more enemies faster.;
, An aggressive sniper should use extended mags because you are most likely going to be engaging a large amount of enemies before you have the time to reload. You should also use chrome lined because it will enable you to get one shot kills easily thus letting you stay alive longer.

, As for perks you will need Ready Up, Sleight of Hand, and Fully Loaded. The rest of the perks are up to you.

"
"
Play Cranked.,
Play Search and Rescue.",How to Level Up Fast in Call of Duty Ghosts (COD Ghosts)1," For players who prefer fast paced game modes with high experience points (XP) rewards, Cranked is surely the game mode for you. Every time you gets a kill, you also get a timer (30 seconds) before self-detonation. Timer will only reset if you get another kill. This eliminates the benefits of camping and definitely promotes fast paced combat - thus, more kills and XP.


When you get a timer (cranked), you also gain perks such as Ready Up, Sleight of Hand, Agility, Marathon, and QuickDraw.
You get double XP on every kill you get while you’re cranked.
Remember, you cannot damage enemies nor allies when you self-detonate.
It is advisable for you to use light weapons in this mode. Avoid using heavy weapons for this mode really requires you to move fast or you will be an easy target.;
, Based on a popular tactical multiplayer mode Search and Destroy, comes Search and Rescue. Teams take turn defending their spot on the map and players can also confirm or deny kills by collecting dog tags of enemies or allies. This mode offers more XP for kills and completing objectives so it is a mode truly for ranking up.


In this mode, you get a whopping 250 XP for each kill. Not only that, each kill confirm/deny also rewards you 250 XP.
Planting or diffusing bombs reward 500 XP.
Unlike Cranked, this mode is very much tactical and does not require rushing in. So make sure you position yourself wisely and land those kills.

"
"
Choose a sniper.,
Choose Attachments.,
Choose Perks.",How to Pick the Perfect Sniper Class for Your Play Style on COD Ghosts2," If you tend to remain stationary, any sniper will do, but the L115 is recommended because it is one shot kill from the knee up.

, As for attachments you will need the silencer (so nobody can see you on their mini map when you shoot) and any sight of your choice.

, You will need Fully Loaded because you are going to be getting a massive amount of kills (if you are good), Ghost (so when people run their cross hairs over you your GamerTag won't pop up, and Off The Grid (so when people on the opposing team get a Sat Com you won't pop up on their mini map).

"
"
Go for Buzz Kills.,
Use Easy to Unlock Kill Streak Rewards.,
Join Private Game Lobbies.",How to Level Up Fast in Call of Duty Ghosts (COD Ghosts)2," During online matches, you will gain more XP when you kill an enemy in a killing spree. That is called Buzz kill and it awards you with 150 XP.


You can check the online game ranking to identify enemies who are most likely to be in a kill streak. They are mostly on top of the chart.

, Using or deploying kill streak rewards automatically grants you additional XP. That being said, it is advisable for you to have low-tiered kill streak rewards so that you can easily achieve them.


Some of the low-tiered yet effective kill streak rewards are SAT COM, Guard Dog, and I.M.S.
For beginners, since stringing kills can be a bit difficult, choosing Support Strike Package instead of Assault Strike Package helps.

, Sometimes some players get together and setup their own private matches meant for boosting. Mostly, this is invite only but if you can get access to these lobbies, you will surely be having a good time ranking up with other players.


You can also host your own private game session and invite other players to join in.

"
"
Pay Attention to Operations.,
Complete Field Orders.,
Watch out for Double XP Weekends.",How to Level Up Fast in Call of Duty Ghosts (COD Ghosts)3," Completing Operations in CoD Ghosts is a good way of gaining fast XP in no time. Some Operations are so easy to complete such as running 5 miles (8.0 km) while in marathon. How hard can that be?


Make sure you have the right weapon or perk to complete your current available Operations.
Switch around weapons early in the game for you to gain weapon related XP from Operations. The lower the level of the weapon, the easier it is to complete its startup Operations.

, Field Orders are available on almost all of the online modes. Most players seem to ignore these blue suitcases but they don’t realize that completing these Field Orders rewards players a handsome amount of XP.

, Sometimes COD Ghosts announce double XP weekends and that’s when online matches really go haywire! Imagine playing Cranked (which gives you double XP by default) during double XP weekend.

You will only be able to choose from a small selection of weapons and attributes when you first begin playing. When you complete a match you will earn experience points and rank up. Advancing in rank will gain access to more loadouts, weapons, appearance customization and earn you squad points. Squad points are currency used to primarily unlock guns, gun attachments and to unlock perks early.


You can share squad points with other squad members, however points that are spent to unlock weapons, attachments or perks will only be unlocked for that squad member and cannot be traded.
Appearance unlocks are entirely cosmetic and do not affect the gameplay, but allows you to personalize your squad member’s look for others to see.;
, You will start with basic loadout configurations for sniper rifles, shotguns and automatic rifles. Each loadout allows you to equip a primary and secondary weapon, attachments for both weapons, a lethal accessory, a tactical accessory, a set of perks and a strike package. The more effective your load out is, the more experience you will be able to gain that will allow you to unlock more weapons. You will not be able to change what each loadout has equipped in-game.


A secondary weapon can come in handy if you run out of ammunition in the middle of gunfire which allows you to fight back.
Both your primary and secondary weapons can be equipped with attachments such as scopes and additional magazine clips. These also cost squad points.
You can also equip a tactical accessory and a lethal accessory which are handheld weapons or benefits such as grenades. If you do not equip a tactical or lethal accessory, you are granted additional perks.
Perks allow you to utilize specific attributes that make specific actions quicker and more effective. Perks can cost between one to four points and you can use a total of eight points., Strike packages determine the killstreaks that you earn. Killstreaks are earned by consecutively killing opponents. There are three types you can equip.


The assault package rewards lethal killstreaks after three kills in a row without dying.

An online subscription is required for Xbox 360, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 game consoles to play online.

, You will find three categories that change the core mechanics.


Standard mode contains all the regular multiplayer modes to play online. This is the best method to play multiplayer if this is your first time playing.
Hardcore mode is designed to be more unforgiving by granting less health to players, limiting Heads Up Display (HUD) markers by not highlighting team members, disabling the mini-map and allowing friendly fire which makes for a more realistic scenarios of ground warfare. Playing on hardcore mode on certain match types allows for more squad points, but involves a higher risk.
Clan VS. Clan requires you to join a clan before you can use this mode. Joining a clan will put you in a dedicated team of players which will allow you to play against other clans.

, You have several choices of game types to play on. Most game types involve team play.


There are several returning game modes seen in previous Call of Duty titles such as Team Deathmatch, Free-for-All and Kill Confirmed. These traditional game modes allow for a better understanding of the rules for the game and are most popular among players.
There are new game modes introduced to the Call of Duty series such as Cranked and Blitz. These game modes are variations on older game modes and make for a nice change of pace, however are generally tougher to learn the rules of the game.

, Proper communication is key for playing well on team modes which requires you to be able to talk with others using a headset or microphone. Be sure to plug one in before starting a game.


Play the game with friends online or bring in a friend via split screen on consoles and work with each other.
Free-for-All does not feature team-based play.

, The more you play, the more squad points that you earn. Try creating different load outs that let you create unique soldiers. Each loadout has its strengths and weaknesses which are determined by a weapon’s range, rate of fire and accuracy. Change to a different loadout that would work against specific enemy players.


You can change your loadout during a game. While you are dead you can bring up your “Options” menu by pressing the Start, Option or Menu button on your controller or the Esc key on the PC version then choose “Change Loadout” and select from your preset loadouts.

, In the corner of the screen, the mini-map will show locations that indicate the positions of other players as well as provide a tactical view of the map you are playing on. The location of enemy players will change based on the sights of your team if they are able to see opposing players. This can be useful to flank other players by approaching them from a different path.


In tactical game modes, it will also show the location of domination points, flags or other targets that are important to the game mode.
By taking advantage of the Sat COMs perk, you can instantly reveal the location of opposing players within a certain range. However the enemy team can also make use of perks such as the Wiretap to hijack your Sat COMs to work in their favor.

, While it is useful to cover ground as quickly as possible, it does reduce your ability to ready a shot or melee attack an opposing player, leaving you vulnerable to attack. Run in short spurts and avoid running around corners., Line up to the sides of a wall or behind a barrier to avoid being left in the open as this makes it easy for other players to target you, especially those on higher ground.

, This is commonly referred to as camping. It is possible to line up shots easily by sitting in one spot and waiting for unsuspecting players, especially for players using sniper rifles. Players will be alerted to your position once they are killed in one of several ways, for example a downed player will witness their Killcam after their death which shows how they were killed by another player. Be prepared to move to a new location. If playing in team games, stay with your team as close as you can.

, Choose to unlock perks and equipment that works with one of your loadout sets. Squad points are earned universally but can only be spent on one squad member.

, The more you play, the more loadouts, perks and other equipment you will be able to unlock. Time and skill are two things that counterbalance each other when it comes to unlocking more abilities.


You can earn killstreaks faster by obtaining and completing field orders. Field orders are given by obtaining a briefcase dropped by a downed player. You are then given a challenge to complete a specific task that involves defeating other players, without dying, to earn a killstreak quickly.
You are limited to how much XP you earn when playing matches offline.
You can rank your squad member up to level 60. This rank level is known as a “Prestige” rank. Unlike in previous Call of Duty games, you keep all of your unlocks and upgrades and you unlock an emblem that simply shows your dedication for playing the game.

, If you have never played a Call of Duty game before or have never played a shooter before, this will be the best place to start. You can choose “Campaign” from the main menu. You will be given live tutorials while playing the game. The campaign does not give the same experience of playing against a live opponent and does not have any multiplayer capabilities, but you will see the difference once you are able to understand how the controls work.


You can change the difficulty of the campaign before you play. You won’t need to complete the campaign in order to prepare yourself, but it will at least provide the basics on how the game plays overall.

, If you want to play team based games, Extinction mode is a survival mini game that can be played with three other players. Choose “Extinction” from the main menu. You can choose to play online by choosing “Online” or “Xbox Live.” You can also play with a friend in split-screen multiplayer by choosing “Local Play.” Work with others and communicate with team members to defeat hordes of enemies.

, Each Call of Duty game plays similar to one another, but will feature a few changes to make it easier to play the game compared to previous iterations.


If you have played a Call of Duty game before, you can easily understand the basics of movement, how to run, aim down your sights and activating streak rewards.
If there are actions you would feel more comfortable with a different button or if you want to adjust your turning speed, you can adjust these under the “Control Options” in the “Options” menu.
There are a few changes to how the game plays, such as the dolphin-dive move from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, now known as the run and slide. Initiate a sprint then press the crouch button to slide on your knees. If you press and hold the crouch button you will slide until you are lying down into the prone position. You can also lean around corners by standing toward a corner. Once you see an arrow appear near your aiming reticle, you can hold the aim button to lean in the direction the arrow was pointing.

, Private matches allow you to play against computer controlled opponents or “bots” that simulate playing against live opponents. You can also play the game with a friend with up to two players in split screen on consoles.


Use private matches as an opportunity to see how unlocked weapons work. See how each weapon can be the most effective for you before trying to use them against live opponents.

Kill the bosses.",How to Play Shadows of Evil in Black Ops III Zombies," The basic mechanics are mostly the same as previous zombie games. Zombies will try to enter your zone through barricaded windows. Keep them out and save up points by killing them.;
, The Beast is an alien form that players can temporarily turn into to do extra tasks. The Beast can traverse vast distances in quick time, open locked areas, revive players, and activate Perk machines. You can turn into the Beast by going up to any area marked by a chalice spewing purple fire and selecting ""Turn Into the Beast"".

, Gobble-Gum is a new feature that gives you a temporary bonus perk. Gobble-Gum machines are scattered throughout the map.

, Follow the blue light in the sky to find the Mystery Box and purchase a random weapon. Each weapon from the Mystery Box costs 950 points.

, There are three directions you can go after opening the first gate, each path splitting off into multiple possible courses.

, When in a pinch, buying a ticket across the map can save your skin. The transit will cart you all the way across the map, which can enable you to escape hordes or reach downed teammates.

, Inter-spaced between rounds, there will be bosses even more dangerous than zombies popping up to kill you.


The Margwa is a gargantuan monster with three heads. It is very fast, and can kill you with one hit, so run and gun. You can kill it by shooting into its opened mouths (indicated by a bright yellow light coming from their insides). It appears in a round with zombies, so you can't devote all of your time to killing it.
Parasites are bug-like creatures that shoot hazardous yellow material at you. They are relatively easy to kill, but they are agile, and often dodge shots.
Insanity Elementals are meatball-looking creatures that roll around at high speeds and explode. They follow the same mechanic of R.A.P.S. from the campaign and multiplayer. They will detonate when close to players, but can be destroyed from afar. The best strategy is to book it away from them, occasionally stopping for 2-3 seconds to turn around and shoot some. Make sure not to run into a corner, as they pile up fast, making escape tricky.

Watch out for double XP.",How to Level Up Fast on Call of Duty: Black Ops," Experience (or XP) determines your rank or level in multiplayer mode, and so matters more in online rankings. The faster you gain XP, the faster you’ll level up and unlock weapons and perks. Start joining online matches by choosing Multiplayer on the CoD:BO menu screen.;
, You can obtain XP on any game mode but some game modes just reward players with more XP.


Search and Destroy (S&D) - This game mode rewards players 500 XP per kill, 600 XP for killing an enemy or planting/defusing a bomb, and 1000 XP per headshot.
Demolition - This game mode rewards players with 50 XP for a kill, 100 for killing a defusing enemy, 100 for planting the bomb and letting it explode, and 500 for defusing a bomb. Unlike S&D, this mode allows player respawn.

, Before the game begins, you will have time to customize a class and add suitable perks for the game mode you have chosen. These perks can help you level faster by providing helpful bonuses to increase your performance.


The Scavenger perk will help the player “scavenge” for ammo and extra magazines, thus preventing the player from easily running out of ammunition.
The Flak Jacket perk decreases all explosive damage taken by 35%, thus making this an important perk for Demolition and S&D, especially when a player is planting or defusing a bomb.
The Ghost perk makes the player invisible to spy planes. This is useful in sneaking into the enemy’s territory since a player with Ghost is not shown in the enemy radar.

, Familiarizing yourself with the map will definitely give you an edge in navigating the map while the match is going on. Take note of the usual hiding places and shortest routes to important spots on the map.

, Choose a weapon that suits your gaming style. If you like running around, then you might want to use an M16. It’s a decent weapon which is readily available at level 1. You might want to use a sniper rifle if your game style involves waiting for enemies, instead of you coming to them.

, In Demolition and S&D modes, taking down enemies is a sure way of gaining XP quickly. However, for a fast boost on XP, make sure you land some headshots, especially in S&D mode. Planting and defusing bombs rewards a decent amount of XP too.

, After awhile, when you’ve already mastered how Demolition and S&D works, you may want to shift to the major leagues: the hardcore Headquarters mode. In this mode, it takes fewer bullets to kill and to get killed. That being said, make sure you have already gained enough XP for additional perks and more powerful weapons, or you'll be toast in this mode. Adjust your perks wisely since this mode eliminates the mini map. Shifting to burst weapons might be a good move, too.

, You may average about 14,000 XP round, and some players have earned as much as 26,500 XP in a single round. The rounds can be fast if you are on a good team or against one, but the XP can be fantastic. Due to Headquarters’ game style, as long as your team has a base you are earning 50 XP every 5 seconds, even if you are dead (more so if you're alive without killing a single enemy).

, This is important, especially if there are lots of players in the room you are currently in. With a good team, you’ll be acquiring lots of XP after a couple of rounds.

, Sometimes CoD:BO announces double XP weekends. Make sure you play online during those days to double the amount of XP you’ll be getting.

Practice your timing.,
Create your quick scope loadout.,
Play against bots.,
Don't move while shooting.,
Practice again and again.,
Understand no-scoping.",How to Get Good at Quick Scoping and No Scoping on Call of Duty Black Ops," Quick scoping is based entirely on timing and muscle memory. Practice raising your scope and learn how long it take for the scope to become ""active"". Raise and lower your scope over and over to get the timing down.;
, In order to successfully quick scope, you will need some specific attachments and perks before you start playing. Try this example loadout, and tweak it based on your playstyle and preferences:


Weapon: L96A1 - This is the premier quick scoping sniper rifle.
Attachment: Variable Scope or Extended Mags. Many people claim that the Variable Scope is more accurate when quick scoping, so give it a try to see how it feels for you. If you can quick scope well with the standard scope, use extended mags to increased the number of shots you have until you need to reload.
Perk 1: Ghost. Keeps you hidden from enemy UAVs
Perk 2: Hardened or Steady Aim. Hardened allows your bullets to penetrate stronger materials, allowing for more wall shots. Steady Aim increasing your accuracy while not aiming, making it useful for no-scopes but it does not affect quick scoping.
Perk 3: Marathon. This perk will allow you to sprint for longer periods, which is very beneficial as moving constantly will keep you alive longer.

, Use the Combat Training option to play against computer controlled opponents. Set them to easy difficulty so that they don't kill you immediately. This will give you a lot of moving targets to practice your quick scoping skills on.

, Even though you should be constantly moving between shots, be sure to stop for a split second while you take the shot. This will keep your accuracy from being penalized due to movement. As soon as you take the shot, start moving again.

, Quick scoping is a skill that is all feel and muscle memory. You won't get it right away, but don't get discouraged. Keep at it, and you'll be getting hate mail in no time.

, No-scoping means taking a shot without raising the scope, or firing the sniper rifle from the hip. The shot will almost never shoot straight at your crosshairs, and will instead shoot randomly in a cone. Steady Aim will lower this cone, but it is still randomized. No-scoping is almost always purely luck.

Or if you are really die hard, go for tactical mask pro for immunity from flash's. Also try the ""supposedly bad"" guns like the Enfield, m14, pm63, RPK, Uzi etc. with different attachments as they can completely change the feel and abilities of the gun along with some good perks # Choose your playing style. Don't camp or use noob tubes. You'll become dependent on these things and you'll end up sucking when you try playing like a normal player.;
, If you liked the mp5k, stick with that until you get the AK-47. If you liked the m16, then the FAMAS is a great gun. The Enfield is frustrating because it doesn't do a lot of damage. Buy the hardline perk. It's extremely useful for beginners.

, If you're feeling the spy plane isn't becoming useful and you want to improve your KD like most new players than buy the RX-XD. It's very cheap to buy and is very useful. With hardline it only requires 2 kills and can get multiple kills.

, Start out playing regular matches. Then play wager matches on the ante up setting. That way you can get good at wager matches without the risk of losing money. Once you feel comfortable start wager matches on weekend gambler. Hopefully you've tried every wager match a few times. Choose the one your best and start gambling. If you're not great at any but still want to play, go with sticks and stones. It can be won just through sheer luck. Remember have fun wager matches are some of the most fun parts of black ops.

, Set the difficulty to recruit and boom. You have every single unlock in the game from killstreaks to guns. You can just destroy the cpu's and gain awesome killstreaks that are normally hard like attack dogs or gunship. You pretty much just fight computers who are horrible and own. You can make any class you want.

, Anyone one has every tried using a suppressed weapon has seen no influence in MAXIMUM distance of bullet travel but instead the amount of bullets it takes to kill someone from far away will increase and for most submachine guns the minimal hits required for a kill are also increase by one

Think about playing campaign mode 3 to 4 times.,
Know your way round the map and places which could be useful for sniping.

,
Begin by playing game modes which are more team based such as headquarters or search and destroy.,
Try to play with every gun and choose the gun that you find easier to use and get more kills with.,
Have the correct perks which suit your gameplay.,
Enjoy it.",How to Get Better at Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops," Play in each difficulty and try to become known to the game and develop tactics which you could use in online mode.;
,, Playing this will show your team skills and it will be easy if you play with your friends as you can communicate and notify which area or task you are doing. An example of headquarters is that your team mates may run for the target to capture while you can stealthy go around to the enemies' respawning area and get the kills so you can send air support giving the team a further boost to win the game.

, This is important as when you are in a situation that you are out of ammo you will need to pick up an enemy's gun or use your secondary weapon. So it is good if you know what guns you are most suited with.

, This can tilt the match to your side. An example would be if you were sniping you would more likely use sleight of hand than marathon as you will be needing it if you are camping or using it if you use your ammo quickly and if the gun has a slow reloading. Also you can get pro perks. To achieve this you will need to get certain amount of kills or to complete a task using that particular perk.

, Do not get frustrated if you are always losing or never getting any kills. All you need to do is practice and try out different things. Try new tactics and develop your guns so you can have the appropriate gun for your liking. Also remember it is just a game, so have fun and good luck.

Find the first dog.,
Go up only one flight, then to your right, there will be a room blocked off with a gate.,
Buy the B23R (this isn't essential, but it helps), and hang around the dog for a while.,
To carry out the first step, wait until a zombie comes into view of the dog and kill it.,
The next dog is in the Infirmary, close to the roof and the room with the part required to build the Acid-Gat.,
The final dog is at the docks, under the Juggernog machine and where you can purchase the Thomson and the Sniper Tower.,
The Hell's Retriever is found underground, somewhere in the room close the shower room with all the hanging bodies.

",How to Obtain the Hell's Retriever in Mob of the Dead," When you first spawn, in the room with double points in the cell and the M14 on the wall, there should be a room next to it with an Olympia. Unlock this, then once in there you should see a staircase.;
, Unlock this gate. When you run through there will be a red drawing of a wolf's head on your right, and a handy 3-round burst pistol in front of you, the B23R.

, After a couple of rounds, the drawing will string to life, revealing what looks like a hell hound, but only its head is visible. It will be snapping and barking.

, It should fly into the dog's mouth and the dog will munch it up. Continue this until the dog gives one last howl and shrinks back into the wall. Move onto the next dog.

, You can access this through the dining room. When you get there, there is a UZI on the wall to the left, and this wouldn't be a wasteful purchase. Repeat step 1, but the zombies can come from behind you through the roof, so watch your back. Once the Dog has vanished, move onto the next and final dog.

, It is here where you can also upgrade the Blundergat to the Acid-Gat, if you have the required objects (See step 2). Feed the dog, watching your back once more, as zombies can jump off the dock behind you. Once the dog has disappeared, you can now get the Hell's Retriever.

Take advantage of the garages.,
Make good use of the vantage point from the upstairs bedrooms.,
Avoid running around corners in the side-lawn.,
Take a defensive position in the bus.",How to Master Nuketown 2025 on Black Ops II," In the blue garage, hide behind the garbage can to reduce your chances of being spotted. This spot is also the perfect cover when sniping. In the orange house, lay a mine, claymore, or shock charge at the door. Peek out for a span of at least 3 seconds.;
, When in the blue house, if you are preparing to shoot out of the window, you might have to break the glass to see. Fair warning, this move also makes you easier to spot. In the entry room, there are two doors. Place a mine or some other trap right in the middle of the two entries.

, Often, people will camp around the edge of corners. To avoid being subject to campers, throw a shock charge around corners, letting you know of the presence of a camper. This will also slow them down enough for you to shoot them.

, This is a great place to keep an eye on the enemy team, provided you have a teammate or a trap ready to cover you.

, To do this, you will need to run over to their spawn. Get their flag and take it to the spot on the map that you want them to ""setup"" at, and let them kill you.


This is where the ""Return Time: Off"" and the ""Auto Return Time: Unlimited"" features come into play, because the bots will stay near their their flag (trying to get it), and the flag will never automatically return to their spawn.

, After you hit a trickshot you will press pause and then end the game. Then your awesome final killcam will be displayed......Have fun and enjoy!

, In the mission “Old Wounds,” you have to resist shooting Kravchenko; instead, interrogate him.


After the interrogation, though, Kravchenko will still be killed, but he has to be killed after he admits that he was associated with Menendez and that his men were inside the CIA.

, In the mission “Suffer with Me,” instead of shooting the person in the head, who is actually Mason, shoot him in the leg. This will cause Menendez to shoot both of Woods’ legs, crippling him.


You might have to shoot Mason in the leg twice.

360's simply do not work.",How to Improve Your Aim in Call of Duty: Black Ops 2," The default is 4, but for most people that is too low. A good range is around 5-8, but everyone's style is different, so try out each in a few games and see which one suits you the best.;
, It is common knowledge that headshots are better and are more respectable, but since it is such a small target, aim for the body until you are more advanced.

, This may seem like something that you already know, but trying to do a no-scope or a quick-scope is extremely harder than it looks. If possible, get an ADS or ACOG scope for increased zoom.

, If you really want to go for headshots, get a laser pointer and aim your pointer on the head and fire. If you are using a pointer, using a scope just slows you down as the laser is as accurate as a scope at close to medium range.

, Just as you are about to shoot someone, click the left trigger. This will make your aim steadier for a few seconds, and making it easier for you to shoot someone.

, These are a brand-name attachments in real life that are inexpensive and greatly increase your range of scoping and quickness.

, This is also another widely known method. When shooting, crouch, as this makes your aim a lot better especially when you are using a sniper or Light Machine Gun.

, Do not attempt these as it will make you look stupid when you are spinning around shooting while someone comes up and knives you. This rarely ever works and when it does it often isn't shown in a final kill cam, making it not worth the effort.

, This is good for your machine guns so they reload quick.

, This makes sure you don't lose your hard earned perks and guns.

, This is important for later rounds when zombies have higher health and are harder to kill.

, You want the Galil, Hamr, or RPD as your primary weapon and duel wielded five-seven or MTAR. Be careful when using the Ray Gun, as the splash damage can easily down you.

, I advise you use the Hammer and duel wielded five-seven because the Hamr is the best machine gun in zombies and the duel wielded five-seven flattens hordes of zombies very quickly and effectively.

, This helps if you need some extra points quick or if you are out of ammo. They are a 1-hit kill, up until round 14 where the become a 2-hit kill.

, These can kill hordes a little easier than regular grenades and are easier to control where you want them to go.

, This will help you greatly in later rounds when you're stuck in a corner or out of ammo.

, You should have all this by round 15, try not to down before then.              Note: this is strictly for team survival only. Good luck!

, Use lightweight for the first perk. For the second perk, use coldblooded. And, for the third perk, use extreme conditioning. The reason you should use these is because, if you see a guy running, you can use extreme conditioning to sprint longer and lightweight to move faster. Use coldblooded because if the enemy is using target finder or a dragonfire, VTOL warship, lodestar, etc. You won't be detected easily.

, Use the reflex sight with the blue dot reticle and the fast mags. It's easier to aim at the head with the reticle and faster to reload.

, The gametype you need to play is hardcore domination. This is because it usually only takes 1 to 2 shots to the head in hardcore and because you can stay near the b-flag and get easy kills.

There's a 50% chance they will not come out of cover unless they try to make it like halo and jump around and try to make you miss.

When you want to advance, the map tool is important for navigation and you will mostly want to use it when checking for enemy players. Practice giving head shots, not only does that save bullets but provides an easy kill when needed.

, When scouting for your team keep in mind that you are the man on the frontlines checking for danger, not to mention you are the one to alert your team-mates when the enemy is coming or where they are preparing to attack. Though it may sound absurd, do not fire your sniper when you are looking out. Only use it to examine the area. However, if you salvage a weapon with a suppressor it is okay to shoot, but make every shot count.

"
"
Choose your class accordingly to the map.,
If your gun has a slow firing rate then make sure your bullet hits your foe right in the head.

,
After killing the foe, always run away from them because they might drop a live grenade after death.

,
Only use melee attacks when behind the foe, or right in front because if your foe sees you, he will hammer you with his machine gun.

,
If the enemy team has hounds on their side, either go in water, up on top of something or in a corner so they have a smaller chance of getting you.

,
Act like a squad.",How to Be Good at Call of Duty World at War," Test what is best on what map in Private match so you can relax when doing it. Remember, snipers are good in high places.;
,,,,, Fight like a squad, die like a squad. Go with your team not individually because if ambushed you can assist each other.

Use Teamwork.,
Take roll.",How to Be a Call of Duty WAW Infantrymen," A simple class, the best would have an M1 Garand with rifle grenade or bayonet or STG.44 with aperture sights with stopping power, double tap, sight of hand, or juggernaut, with second chance, for your blue perk you should have a satchel charge, bouncing betty, bandoleer, or bazooka.;
, Infantrymen is a tactical cooperative class especially in team death match and sabotage, the ability to have squads is useful in this kind of combat frame and you should use squads in every game, always travel in 2's or 3's and always stick together to provide support for your teammate, the second chance perk is an important essential to when backing your teammate if your teammate goes down the chances of him being revived are greater with 3's.

, Each of your teammates (only with friends should be assigned certain jobs when playing sabotage or any kind of tactical variant of game, ex. jim- shotgunner/close quarter combat, tim- heavy gunner/support and defensive gunner, stan- sniper/ scout or defensive sniper, rem- sub-machine gunner/ close quarter building raider.)

Weapons can be unlocked only when your character reaches a certain level (such as the R870 MCS, which can be used when your character reaches level 4).
Complete missions and battle out on multiplayer matches to keep gaining experience points (XP) to raise your character’s level a lot quicker.;
, Diamond Camo becomes instantly available once you unlock Gold. Gold is the last camouflage that will be unlocked once you complete all the challenges for each weapon. To unlock the Gold camo for a certain class, you need to:


Unlock low-level camos for each weapon first, from DEVGRU to Kryptek Typhon. To unlock these camos, you only need to acquire a specific number of kill streaks (by killing a certain number of enemies using the specific weapon you want to unlock the camos).
Unlock the intermediate-level camos, from Carbon Fiber up to Skulls. To unlock these camos, you need to achieve medals. Medals are given to you when you perform special moves, such as the Revenge medal, which is awarded to you when you kill an enemy who killed you first.
Note that each weapon has its own specific required kill streaks and medals. But the rules for unlocking camos for each weapons and class are all the same.

, Once all the weapons in a class have Gold Camo, the Diamond Camouflage will be unlocked for that specific class. Go to the Main menu and select “Create a Class” from the list of options. This will open up the Weapons screen.

, The first step in the glitch is to run and dive into the left-hand corner in the lobby (the place where you start the map) lay there, push your character as far up to the wall as he can go, and get another player to help.

, Yep, you guessed it. Now, once you are prone on the floor, facing the wall, get another player (only one) to do the same as you did, but make sure he lands on you.

Pick Your Tactical Grenade.,
Choose Your Equipment.,
Choose Your Tier 1 Perk.,
Choose Your Tier 2 Perk.,
Choose Your Tier 3 Perk.",How to Create the Perfect Call of Duty: Black Ops Class," Choose a primary weapon that fits your playing style. If you like having mobility go for an SMG (Sub Machine Gun); if you like camping try a Sniper Rifle; if you're looking to overpower your opponent pick an LMG (Light Machine Gun) or a Shotgun; if you want a balanced weapon equip an Assault Rifle.;
, Pick an attachment that will benefit you in combat. The Grenade Launcher, as well as Masterkey, is like having an extra weapon. Scopes are great for getting long range target and overall increase your accuracy. There are plenty of scopes to choose from, so pick the one that you like best.

, It's a good idea to pick a secondary weapon that will compliment your primary weapon. For example if you are using a long range sniper rifle you might want to choose a short range pistol or the Ballistic Knife. Launchers are helpful in taking out those pesky spy planes and attack helicopters as well as blowing the opposing team to bits.

, All three of the lethal grenades have their pros and cons. Frag grenades can be bounced off of walls; Semtex grenades will stick to enemies and walls; the Tomahawk is an instant kill and can be picked up and thrown again after you use it.

, Depending on your preference you can equip a number of different tactical grenades. Willy Pete grenades will deal a small amount of damage to enemies and create a cloud of smoke; Nova Gas will create a small cloud of gas dealing damage to players in the cloud as well as hampering their vision and movement; Flash Bangs will create a bright flash of light blinding players within range; Concussion grenades will hamper the movement and blur the vision of players in range; Decoy grenades will stay on the field for a while and simulate gun fire and make it appear to enemies that there is a player on their mini-map.

, Camera Spikes and Motion Sensors both reveal the location of near-by enemies making them ideal for snipers. C4 can be detonated whenever you like. The claymore is also a good choice, it detonates when an opponent gets near it. The Tactical Insertion lets you choose where you spawn getting you back in the game quicker. The Jammer will disable enemy radar and equipment in its radius. All of these make welcome additions to any class.

, Finding a perk that fits your playing style is important. The Ghost perk is great for snipers as it allows them to remain hidden from enemy radar. Lightweight will increase your movement speed which is helpful to those who like to stay mobile. Scavenger will allow you to replenish ammo and grenades from fallen soldiers and is good if you find yourself running low on ammunition frequently. Flak Jacket will reduce the damage taken by grenades and other explosives. Hardline is a fantastic addition to any class; it reduces the number of kills required for your killstreaks by 1.

, The Scout perk is a must-have for snipers, it allows you to steady your aim for longer periods of time. Steady Aim is perfect for any dual-wield weapon and shotguns. Hardened allows you to shoot through walls. Warlord allows your primary weapon to hold two attachments(excluding Masterkey, Grenade Launcher, and Flamethrower). Sleight of Hand greatly reduces your reload speed and is another perk that goes well with any class.

, Tactical Mask makes you immune to Nova Gas. Ninja makes you move silently (good for snipers). Marathon allows you to sprint longer (good to pair with Lightweight). Second Chance gives you the ability to pull out a pistol before you die and maybe even get revived by a teammate. Hacker makes it easy to see enemy equipment, keeping you safe from claymores and other explosives.

These players aren't going to try to kill you or win the game, but will just occupy the eight spots in the game to allow for your boosting. Since this is cheating, you will need to pick people you trust who are amenable to the goals of the session.;
, Then create a similar party of four with your controllers and your third friend. This will create two teams of four to fill a game entirely with dummy accounts.

, This is one of the main multiplayer options.

, Backing out is when you join a game and then leave because it doesn't have the desired settings. In this case you want to keep trying until you get a game with demolition.

, Find their accounts on Xbox Live and select the option to invite their party to your game.

, This will let you boost different classes at the same time.

, Have one team plant bomb A, and then right after have the second team plant bomb B. Then defuse bomb A, and then bomb B. If you do it in this order time will never run out.

Know what is going on around you.,
Scan the field.,
Get above the enemy.",How to Be Better at Call of Duty: Black Ops1," Where is the firing coming from? To find out, use the minimap––it tells you where your opponents are even without the UAV. If you see a chunk of your teammates on the left side of the minimap, chances are the enemy is on the other side. Use this knowledge to your advantage and situate yourself to be in prime position to get the first shot.;
, Much like driving you've got to pay attention to the entirety of your peripheral vision. Watch for dark corners and turns that would allow an enemy to get the jump on you.

, People don't look up. You can just shoot down on them. You should put a claymore on the stairs (or however you got up) so if they try to get revenge, they blow up.

"
"
Don't chase, but when you do, don't shoot until the kill is 100%.,
Don't sprint around corners.,
Move around.",How to Be Better at Call of Duty: Black Ops2," Typically if you shoot someone but it doesn't kill them and they turn the corner one of two things will happen. A) They stop turn around and wait for you to follow after giving them the advantage of being ready to shoot. B)They keep running in hopes of getting to a safe place and hoping you run into their teammates. When this happens, do not chase the target, let it go and move forward unless they turn back around and try to shoot you, in that case finish them off. However if you have the jump on them and they don't see you, then yes you can chase the enemy, however do not open fire until you know that you can finish him off.

, Instead, aim down the sights!

, Again, situational awareness, you can play run and gun but if you're not good at that then holding a spot and picking off enemies who are dumb enough to keep running into your sights is perfectly fair and normal. However don't get comfy at the same spot that you exploited for 10 kills without dying. Eventually your enemies wise up and know exactly where to aim. So after picking off 2-4 people from the same spot, move over to another spot nearby that gives a clear shot at the enemy when they come into the same area expecting to find you where you've been hiding the last 5-7 minutes of the game.

"
"
Utilize grenades.,
Shoot down choppers - that way the enemy can't see you, have a class for shooting down choppers and other kill streaks.,
Use silencers.",How to Be Better at Call of Duty: Black Ops3," These tools can be used tactically and go beyond just a frag grenade kill. You can use a frag grenade to also flush an enemy out who's bunkered in. Flashbangs and Concussion grenades are fantastic and great for fishing out a room before you charge in. Toss one in there before you burst in firing.

, If you have a black hat that's even better but get to a safe place to hack to UAV or care package.

, They might lower the damage of the weapon but it's more than made up for in stealth when you fire it. Your blip does not show on the enemy's radar; use this to your advantage. If you miss a shot, don't worry, as the enemy won't know which direction it came from.

"
"
Learn the maps.",How to Be Better at Call of Duty: Black Ops4," This is about 40% of the fight. Know the maps, the nooks and crannies and the spots where people frequently like to hide. Know those spots from both angles, why are they so popular and what are their blind spots.


Having a strong sense of awareness is a huge key to playing well. It limits your deaths and puts you in prime position to get the kill.

Assault. Set your streaks to killing support. Streaks that would help you here would be things like Assault Chopper, Gunship, Dogs, or Valkyrie Rockets.

When in a battlefield you will need to use your machine gun and rockets if there are no tanks, but try to stick with the HMG, cover is important especially for this scenario.

, For your Perk 1 slot, Ghost will help hide you from those pesky spy planes, and the Pro version will make you invisible to any Attack Helicopters, Chopper Gunners, and Gunships.

, For your Perk 2 slot, Scout will help anyone who'll be doing some long distance sniping, since it doubles the time you can hold your breath. If not, Sleight of Hand would help make sure you can aim at the enemy before he does and not get caught with a slow reload. If you're having trouble aiming down the sights, switch Sleight of Hand with Warlord so you can have a Suppressor and Red Dot Sight.

, For your Perk 3 slot, Ninja will help you get close to the enemy without him hearing your footsteps. If you're afraid of any Motion Sensors spotting you, Hacker Pro would help keep you hidden from them.

And to note think tactically and work as a team.

",How to Become a Better Ninja in Black Ops," Now Ninja Classes can be modified to personal preference depending on what purpose they will serve. Here are a few set ups and what purpose they are best for:


Stalker Class:Now if you want to stalk opponent's, play dead or cover objectives defensively from visual cover this class is terrific:

Primary Weapon: Ak74U w/ Suppressor
Secondary Weapon:Ballistic Knife
Equipment:Tactical Insertion (if you want to play dead or use as a flanking tool) or Motion Sensor for setting up a kill box.
Perks: Ghost Pro (because removes name, enemy cross hairs don't turn red when they target you, etc). For perk two it's a choice between either Steady Aim Pro (which reduces wait after knife kills which is extremely useful) or Warlord (grip and suppressor is a useful combo.Sleight Of Hand would be useful for reload also but again you can circumvent it's usefulness.


Class 2: Ballistic Massacre: Now if you plan only using knives then use this class.

Primary: SMG of choice (It's recommend to use either Kiparis Or AK47U)
Secondary :Ballistic Knife
Equipment: Not really important so choose depending on preference or camera if you wanna have a go with long distance tomahawking.
Perk 1:Lightweight Pro(gives you the speed to close distance quicker which is good for melee kills)
Perk 2:Steady Aim Pro for faster melee kills and hip fire kills.
Perk 3:Ninja/Ninja Pro for silent movement and with pro completely silent.

;
, If they spot you running one way round a building think and also keep note of any blips on radar or spy plane.Try to do the opposite of what they expect.

, Playing dead is when you hold a tactical insertion in your hand and lie prone. Not entirely 100 percent convincing due to head movements but it can still work. Remember, if possible, use bodies as cover (lie in them) or even Try to do not look around a lot as this just adds more movement and will result in an easy kill.

Use SoH, Assassin, and Sitrep or Steady Aim.

, Use a silencer and impact, as this proves to be an amazing combo. Perks use Scavenger, Hardline, and Dead Silence when you get it. From these levels on, it is recommended that you play Kill Confirmed or Search., Once you get to level 80, you can get your gold guns and (what games are for), just have fun., Once you hit level 80 you can prestige and earn a Prestige Shop token. Use it on double XP to maximize your XP gained to the next prestige level. But, if you think it is a waste, then use it on whatever you like, either opening a new class slot or unlocking weapons/perks that can be used after level 5.

, If you do use Attack Killstreak, do not use it on Kill Confirmed, unless you are playing with a good team. The object of Kill Confirmed is to kill others and collect their dog tags. You will not win or maximize game points by just killing people, unless you're one of those that gets a Massive Ordinance Air Blast (MOAB) in every game you play or getting 45 kills and one death.

, Once unlocked, try using with SMG: Extreme Conditioning, Assassin or Hard line, and Dead silence.

For Assault Rifles, try using Sleight of Hand, Assassin or Hard line, Dead silence or Marksmen. Do not use Blind Eye unless you're taking out enemy aircraft. The only other time that you would use any other perks is when you use the Specialist Killstreak. When using that killstreak, do not use Scavenger Perk at all.






Watch a YouTube an in depth explanation of Specialist Killstreak so that you can fully understand why.

Equip the Steady Aim and Quickdraw perks.,
When you quickscope, don't aim too far from your target.,Remember, it's not a quickscope if you spend more than a second aiming, that's called a hardscope, which is greatly disliked by the community,

,
Always use a 1 shot kill capable sniper when quickscoping.,
Consider equipping an ACOG scope, which greatly increases your ability to quickscope, but makes it much less exciting and has less zoom power than the normal scope.",How to Quickscope on Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3," The perk Steady Aim makes your crosshairs smaller, thus ensuring easier quickscoping and even a chance to noscope once in a while.The perk Quickdraw allows you to scope in much faster, allowing for you to quickscope much faster.;
, if you do, you'll have to convert into a drag scope, which is much more accurate but is extremely hard to make look like a ""quickscope"". The closer to the target the better, so you only have to make minimal changes to your aim.

,, Snipers in this category include the L118A, the MSR, the Barrett .50 Cal and the AS50. Snipers such as Dragunov and RSASS should only be used when firing rapidly in succession .

Have fun.",How to Become a Pro in COD Black Ops 2," Make a class that suits you.


If you want to camp, then you probably just go with an LMG with Target Finder and stay in the corner all game.
If you run around a lot, then it might be best to use an MP7 with long-barrel or suppressor, fast-mag or quick-draw, and fore-grip or rapid-fire. This gives you range or stealth, rapid attacks, and stability or RAMBO!

If you don't like the MP7 you can go with the PDW with long-barrel or suppressor, fore-grip, and rapid-fire. This is actually a really good class because it has a really big clip with extremely fast firing and still stability. These are the kind of choices you need to make when choosing your class.


It might be a good idea to never put a secondary weapon - because you only have 10 slots and there is never a real need for a secondary weapon when you can just pick up someone else's weapon.
Some good perks are Hardline, Lightweight, or Ghost - Fast Hands - and Extreme Conditioning. This allows you for score streaks, fast movement, stealth, quick fires, and longer sprinting time. Always put at least 1 EMP to assist your team in taking out Sentries/Guardians.;
, This is important because it is what decides your strengths.


If you have a sub-machine gun, you can camp at close range, or you can go out and kick butt. It isn't a good idea for long range unless necessary - for you waste bullets with the wrong class.
If you have an assault rifle, you are really versatile, but you can't move very fast. You can try using the M8A1 with reflex, fast mag, and quick-draw.
If you have an LMG, you should really just camp. It gets you the most kills, and you can't really move much.
If you have a Sniper Rifle, you can quick scope (This is not really recommended unless you are experienced), hard-scope (taking out targets at long range) or you can hard-camp - which is camping and hard-scoping. Most people are hard-campers, and people tend to find this really annoying, so this is not recommended unless you are just in it for the kills. Just remember, as a sniper, watch your back for spawn flips. Check the minimap from time to time, and scope where your team isn't there.

, When coming to choosing guns, it's best to know what gun you feel comfortable using. Something light with good aim or something heavy with good sights. Some people choose to have an assault rifle with a light machine gun, while others choose to just have a sniper. The guns depend on your position in the game.

If you like to run around while hammering everyone with a Vector K10 or the HAMR itself, then you have no need to have a sniper unless you're damn right good at quickscoping and noscoping. However, if you're the one who runs straight into camping then a sniper is a good choice for you
If you have an assault shield, it's assumed that you have a backup gun. If you don't, just go Rambo and kill people by bashing, backing up, and then charging at them to repeat the process. Most importantly, don't aim for the head. To get kills, start by shooting randomly in their direction, then slowly aiming for their head so you don't lose accuracy. If you're in close range, don't bother scoping - you'll waste time. Instead, start firing, and then scope while you're doing it. As an overall rule, don't stay in one place at more than a couple of seconds, unless you are camping.

, Playing online can help you boost your skills dramatically but sometimes, it's better if you practice with bots instead of players. Bots are more vulnerable than players online so it's easy for you to test your skills and try out different methods.

In Black Ops 2, there are different maps to choose from, and it's good to have a little wonder around on your own game with no bots. Get to know the maps; find a few good sniper spots if you're handy with a sniper.

, While you're playing, remember that this is just a game. If you try extremely hard to win, chances are you're just going to end up getting frustrated and give up. If you have fun while kicking butt, then chances are you'll do better. Look for vantage points, and try some 360s! When you feel yourself getting stressed out, remember to just let go (like Elsa) and scream in rage.

Power ups have their own icons (like a skull for the Insta-Kill or a hammer for the Carpenter power up) and can be found on different maps of the game.

, For some modes of the games, like on Zombie maps, you can upgrade your weapon to increase its firepower or ammo capacity. Weapons can be upgraded using the “Pack-a-Punch Machine,” a special in-game object that looks like a slot machine.


The Pack-a-Punch Machine can be found on many Zombie maps. Just approach the object and select the weapon you want to upgrade.

Expert snipers can kill you with one shot the moment you come within their range.

, Keep track of your teammate’s location using the mini map on the upper-left corner of the screen. Knowing where they are can help you figure out where the enemies may be.

Camping enemies will immediately fire at you once they see you. When this happens, you can easily retreat, using the wall corner as your shield.

, Flashbangs will light up your surroundings, temporarily blinding any opponents hiding around the corner, especially snipers. Throw a Flashbang and quickly walk around the corner while the place is brightly lit.

, Try to avoid becoming a sitting duck by holding your position for more than a few seconds. Keep moving, especially when you get spotted by an enemy. Moving around makes it harder for the other player to aim and shoot at you.

, Once you run out of ammo, go to a safe place or hide behind something before you reload. Reloading in front of an enemy or in between a fight is not a very bright idea will most likely get you killed.

When you’ve hit a wall in earning extra experience for your weapon, switch to a new one. This will keep you constantly earning XP as you use new weapons, and has the side benefit of making you a more well-rounded player.If there is a weapon that you are having a difficult time getting kills with, consider abandoning it altogether, or go into a custom game and practice with the weapon you have trouble with. While getting XP from a variety of weapons will speed up your ranking progress, you will negate that progress by spending too much time with a weapon that doesn’t get results.;
, Every game mode will earn you XP, but some game modes will let you earn it faster than others. Two of the most popular modes for getting as much XP as possible are Kill Confirmed or Hardpoint. Not only do these give you points for killing people, but they also give you points for completing tasks.


Kill confirmed gives you an extra 100 XP for every enemy dog tag that you pick up, essentially doubling the amount of XP you can get per kill. You also get a larger bonus for preventing enemies from getting your own dog tags.
Black Ops 2 rewards playing the objectives more than any previous Call of Duty. This means that to rank the quickest, you’re going to need to help out your team.
If it is a Double XP Weekend, then kills in Search and Destroy are worth 1000 XP.

, Smaller maps such as Nuketown, Standoff or Grind will constantly be throwing you into the fray. This means more chances to score kills, which in turn means that each match is more productive. Be prepared for quick reflexes, and bring your short-ranged weapons such as submachine guns or shotguns.

, Each score streak has a challenge attached to it, and you will receive bonus XP when you meet that challenge (5/15/25/50 kills). Only use the scores streak for as long as you are progressing with it. For example, if you have maxed out a score streak by completing all of the challenges, or the last challenge is difficult and taking a while, switch to a new one so that you can start accumulating XP again.

, Once you’ve maxed out most of your score streak challenges, move on to using support streaks such as the UAV, VSAT, or EMP. You will get a small XP bonus every time another player on your team gets a kill while the support streak is active. While the bonus is small, they can add up quickly. Support streaks are also easier to obtain than score streaks, meaning you can use them quite often during a match.

, There are several modes that allow you to “farm” XP off of objectives if you play smart enough. Essentially, you will be allowing the enemy to complete an objective, and then immediately reclaim that objective for yourself. To do this effectively, you will need to be in communication with your team so that no one messes up the farming. Some examples:


Domination: You will earn an extra 100 XP when killing an enemy while capturing the objective. Use this to your advantage by sitting in a capture point, killing a few enemies, and then leaving the capture point before you claim it. Repeat this for as long as possible to earn double XP for every kill.
Hardpoint: Capture the hardpoint as normal and earn 200 XP. Then, allow the enemy team to capture it back, and then immediately reclaim it. This will earn you another 200 XP. Repeat this as many times as possible.
Demolition: Plant the bomb and then allow the enemy to disarm it. As soon as the bomb is defused, kill the defuser and replant the bomb. If you are on defense, let the opponent plant the bomb and then kill and defuse. In both instances, allowing the enemy to complete the objective first will earn you more points.

, You will earn double XP for any kills you make while holding the flag. Take some time while returning to your base to get as many kills as possible. Have teammates use support streaks such as EMP to assist you, because you appear on the enemy’s minimap while holding the flag.

, Each game mode has separate challenges and medals that you can earn. By cycling through the different modes often, you will increase the amount of XP you can earn for each match.

, Since every weapon, attachment, perk, and technique has challenges associated with it, you can optimize your loadouts so that you are completing multiple challenges at the same time.


For example, the Stock attachment has a challenge for 50/100/200/300/500 kills while using the stock. While this by itself will not add up to much XP, combine it with the Quickdraw and Reflex Sight challenges and you can complete 3 challenges at once while aiming down the sight.

, There are a variety of medals that you can earn each match for completing specific objectives. While some of these are based off of luck, getting them regularly can make a big difference.


First Blood: If you get the first kill in the game, you will earn 500 XP. You can maximize your chances for this by starting with a fast-moving loadout so that you can rush to the chokepoints in the map ahead of your teammates.
Wipeout: Clear two or more enemies from an objective and earn 250 XP. Use a silenced weapon to avoid alerting the enemy to your presence.
Long Shot: A long-distance kill will earn you an extra 250 XP. While this mainly benefits snipers, you can take shots across the map with any weapon in the hopes of landing this medal.
Opening Move: You get 500 XP for capturing the neutral flag in Domination. You can earn this for each round, potentially netting you 1000 XP per game. Use a lightweight class with a Tactical Insertion to keep pushing at the flag until you capture it.
Blackout: You can earn 100 XP for destroying an enemy UAV. Using a launcher, you can earn several hundred XP per spawn simply by destroying enemy UAVs.

, This may seem obvious, but you gain significant bonuses for winning matches. Try to find a group of friends who all communicate well. Using simple teamwork will lead your team to victory more often than not, and can really speed up the leveling process.


You get a 250 XP medal each time that your team wins, and this can add up to a lot in the long run. The winning team also gets a larger end-of-match bonus than the losing team.

, From improving aim to learning map layouts, playing often and learning from your mistakes will increase your efficiency and your ranking speed. Watch videos of pros online, and implement their tactics in your next match. Find good spots on maps to score easy kills. Work on improving your aim. All of this will lead to higher scores and quicker XP accumulation., Try to aim a little high to have a better chance at a headshot to unlock new camos. Which will give you more XP as you get closer to gold and don't stay on one gun trying to get the next camo if you are having trouble getting headshots. Also have a goal of a certain amount of headshots You want to have at the end of each match. You will want to play something like Domination or Team Death Match which are longer lasting game modes and you should play hardcore to have a better to get the headshot with in the first few bullets., When trying to get blood thirsty medals you would want to play hardcore. You would also probably find it easier if you used the following; extended clip, quick draw, and fore grip.

, This is important as when you are in a situation that you are out of ammo you will need to pick up an enemy's gun or use your secondary weapon. So it is good if you know what guns you are most suited with.

, This can tilt the match to your advantage. For example, in most game modes, there is no reason to run hardwired. If you are a run and gun player, a good combo would be Ghost/Lightweight or Blind Eye.

, Do not get frustrated if you are always losing or never getting any kills. All you need to do is practice and try out different things. Try new tactics and develop your guns so you can have the appropriate gun for your liking. Also remember it is just a game, so have fun and good luck.

It may seem like wasting time in higher levels, but if you repair the barriers then that means less zombies that are swarming you at a time, plus they give you ten extra points for every one you repair.;
, The starting weapons on the wall aren't all that great. You typically have 2 choices, the M14, a semi-automatic rifle with low damage, and the Olympia, a double-barreled shotgun with moderately low damage. One other starting weapon is the Ballista, featured in Origins. This is a bolt-action sniper rifle with moderate damage and iron sights. None of these guns will last you more than the first 5 rounds, 6 or 7 if you're good.

, Let's face it, you aren't going to get by by buying the guns on the walls and using your pistol, you are going to have to use the mystery box at least once. However, don't use it too much or you are going to be wondering how you got stuck in the hole. To spot the mystery box, look for a blue light straight into the air.

, Locate parts and build things such as the Zombie Shield, which protects you from behind, or the head chopper, which helps with killing zombies. Build things on benches closest to where you will be for most of the game. Remember that you are vulnerable while building, so make sure the coast is clear or that your teammates have your back before building.

, Headshots are the most efficient way to kill zombies. If you go for gut shots, you are going to waste a lot more ammo than you would if you tried to shoot them in the head.

, Unless you are just starting out, knifing is too unreliable and most of the time that is how you are going to die. However, if you are on the first round or you are low on ammo or points, you can shoot them for around 5 times then knife them, giving you even more points. You can use the Galvaknuckles (TranZit, Buried, Nuketown, and Die Rise) or Thunderfists (which are only on Origins), because both are one hit kill until round 13. Before round 13, you're going to want to make the most of them to conserve ammo!

, Fighting off swarms is a lot easier when you are doing it with four people and they can revive you if you go down.

, These are especially useful in the higher levels or if you have a light machine gun or sub machine gun. You can easily kill off dozens of them in a tight space if you are getting low on health.

, Perks give you boosts in stats in exchange for stats, ranging anywhere from 500 to 4000 points. In normal play, you can have a maximum of 4 perks at a time. On some maps however, such as Buried, you may have as many perks as you can get via the Wonderfizz machine. Arguably the top 4 picks for perks are:

Juggernog
Speed Cola
Double-tap Root Beer
Stamin-Up (if playing solo. If playing with a team, get Quick Revive instead). Also, avoid Mule Kick because if you get down, you lose a weapon and 4000 points.







, Pack-a-Punching any weapon costs 5000 points. Doing so refills the ammo and adds buffs to the weapon, along with giving it different colored bullets. Due to the high price, it is recommended you only Pack-a-Punch high-tier weapons such as the Ray Gun or Galil., Learning make a train is a simple and very effective way to avoid getting overwhelmed. By constantly moving in a roughly circular manner you will cause to zombies to follow you and bunch up as they all try to take roughly the same path. When making a train, only kill zombies that you cannot avoid and are directly in your way as stopping to deal with stragglers can allow the swarm to catch up to you and surround you. To eliminate the train, wait until there are no zombies coming at you from the front, then turn and fire. Be careful not to stand still for too long or zombies may start converging on you from all sides as the new ones spawn in to replace the ones killed., For example, get the Paralyzer gun in Buried in Bo2, and use it wisely. It stuns enemies and freezes them, while killing them, if held on for a while. It has unlimited ammo, and it can allow you to fly. Aim it down and shoot and jump at the same time to fly (temporarily, so make sure your near your destination.) On that map, the Paralyzer can be used to avoid opening doors, skipping the maze, and flying over obstacles."

Rushing.",How to Be a Good Sniper in Black Ops 2," Don't just use what ""everyone else"" is using, but find a weapon that makes you comfortable. There are currently four different snipers in Black Ops 2 and they are as followed: SVU-AS, DSR 50, Ballista and XPR-50. There are strengths and weaknesses on each and it also corresponds to your play style. The DSR 50 is the best weapon to land a one-shot kill because everything from the waist up is one bullet, it's a great weapon for inexperienced snipers who don't quite have that amazing accuracy...yet. Then the Ballista. The Ballista is more for the experienced players because it kills from the chest up in one shot however, it has faster handling speeds for scoping in and out. Lastly there are the two semi-automatic sniper rifles, the SVU-AS and the XPR-50. Both are great for spamming the controller and sending a torrent of bullets in your opponents path. All of these are great choices, but the important thing is finding what works for you!;
, If you stay in one place but are picking off every member of the enemy team, eventually one of them will become very vengeful and kill you. So for the sake of staying alive, move around. Movement is important because if you stay in one area, that little red dot on the radar will do you in. You want to keep your enemies on their toes so they cannot pinpoint your location. You could do this by taking a few shots and moving on to another location. Just like a real life sniper.

, This is crucial, because if you know nothing about the map you are in, well that's just asking to get owned. The other great advantage it gives you is knowing all the spots to get people from.

, Because you are a sniper, it isn't ideal to go chaotic in a CQC battle against an opponent with an assault rifle or sub machine gun. You will more than likely lose. It is a sniper rifle for the reason that you keep your distance, and take the shot where the deck is stacked more in your favor than theirs, giving you that guaranteed kill.

, If in your mind, you know for a fact that you probably will not land the shot, then don't take it in the first place, it will give away your position and that is a big no no.

, If you take your time in the field, you will find yourself not in so many sticky situations as you were before, and you will find yourself ending up with less deaths at the end of the match.

, For some, it would be fast mag or variable zoom, this is really a matter of personal preference though as it can vary greatly depending on the player.

, When you take your time shooting, you may get killed more at first, but it will greatly help you with that time on target. The speed will come after that.

, To help improve your accuracy laser sight is a great attachment and works as steady aim making your cross-hairs smaller helping you hit the shots without much effort.

, If you're an experienced sniper user then by now you've probably learned to rush with it but in order to do this just keep a fair distance away from your opponent. Take the shot, if you miss then whip out your pistol and show off your trigger finger.

, This game mode is located under Combat Training, and will give you a good feel for how the game works until you hit level 10.

, If a particular weapon or class setup works for you, stick with it. With the new Pick 10 class system, you may be tempted to change everything at once - this is a trick; only change things slightly so you can get acclimated to a different play style.

, Not only might they have some tips for you, but they might also call out enemy positions (for example, ""Sniper at A""). In the very likely event that they are simply trash talking, the mute button will be your best friend.

, If you've played such a game before, the following tips should be apparent.

, Don't stand still while firing at your enemy at close range, if at all possible. Running and gunning is the key to not only getting kills but staying alive.

, The enemy can still hit you while moving, and you can't sprint indefinitely.

, Don't stand in the middle of a choke point - you'll only get shot at. In Black Ops II, this effectively means staying out of the entire middle of the map; instead of diving into the line of fire, sneak around the edges of the map and pick off the enemies moving towards the middle.

, If you're playing Team Deathmatch, focus on getting more kills and fewer deaths. If you're playing Domination, give everything you've got to defending your team's flags and capturing the enemy team's.

, You can unlock better weapons and other useful things such as score streaks or perks at higher levels, and they may give you a winning edge.

, This attachment can be used to strafe to avoid enemy gunfire.

, Its best if this is done behind cover as well. This will increase your chances of survival even more.

Develop a Sniper Rifle.,
Take on the mission “Side Op 82: Make Contact with Emmerich.” Miller, your Mother Base XO, will inform you of a Side Op to meet with Dr. Emmerich.,
Enter the ruins to start Episode 11.,
Figure out Quiet’s initial sniping position.,
Look for a good sniping point or call a supply drop.,
Use Your NVG (night vision gear) when Quiet disappears.,
Play the cut scene but don’t pull the trigger.,
Extract Quiet using the chopper.,
Go back to Mother Base for Side Op.,
Look for Quiet’s cell.,
Take her on a mission.",How to Get Quiet in Metal Gear Solid V," To counter the range of Quiet’s sniper rifle, you’ll need to develop a sniper rifle of your own. As soon as it’s available for development on your iDroid, make sure to spend some GMP on at least the RENOV - ICKX SR (Sniper Rifle). It only costs 40000 GMP to make and should be more than enough to take out Quiet when you meet her later.;
, Take on this mission and drop in at the LZ closest to the mission area. Don’t forget to equip your Sniper Rifle during the mission sortie screen.


Either D-Horse or D-Dog will do fine as buddies for this part of the mission since they’ll have minimal impact on its completion (at least before and during the fight with Quiet).

, Follow the road that leads to Dr. Emmerich’s whereabouts. You’ll eventually come across some ruins and upon entering it a cutscene will automatically play. If you rightfully avoided the Skulls in Episodes 1 and 6 then this should be your first proper boss fight., After the cutscene plays out, you will almost always be spotted by Quiet, who is aiming for your head atop some ruins in the area in front of you. Duck behind cover and use your Int Scope to figure out Quiet’s location. The glint from her sniper rifle’s scope or its laser sights are usually dead giveaways of her location.

, Once you’ve established where she is, make sure that you mark her on your iDroid. You can then choose between using your sniper rifle to chip away at her health or call a supply drop to her location and take out half of her stamina.

, Hitting Quiet once with either the supply drop or with your sniper rifle will force her to transfer to a different location and disappear. So you won’t lose sight of her (or at the very least so you’d know the direction she ran off to), make sure you turn on your NVG.


Don’t worry if you don’t see where she set up her next sniping spot. You can always go out in the open and wait for the white cloud that indicates the location of where she’s sniping.

, Once you’ve depleted either Quiet’s health or stamina, she will move to the northern end of the ruins. Going to her location will trigger an interactive cutscene where you are urged by Miller to shoot her. Since we want to have her as a buddy, you can ignore his instructions and just wait for the cutscene to finish.

, Since you can’t use the Fulton Recovery System on Quiet, you’ll need to wait for a chopper sent by Ocelot to pick you up. Boarding the chopper together with Quiet will then trigger another set of cutscenes which culminate in Quiet getting detained at Mother Base., After Quiet’s detention, you can pick up where you left off with Side Op 82. By the time you finish this Side Op and the story mission that follows (as well as Side Op 14), you will get a call from Ocelot to visit Quiet back at Mother Base.

, Aside from Ocelot’s call, your iDroid will also give you a mission list update. Check your iDroid and take on Side Op 111: Visit Quiet. If you’re already at Mother Base, you can go directly to the Medical Unit Platform and you’ll find a set of stairs in front of the helipad that leads to her detention cell.

, After Side Op 111, Ocelot will inform you that you can now develop weapons for Quiet. Immediately start development on her Wicked Butterfly, and once that’s done, you can then take her out to missions.


Bringing Quiet on missions will raise your bond with her and open up development for upgrades to her weapons.
One mission that you can farm to raise her bond level with you is Episode 3: A Hero’s Way. Have her take out the commander from a sniping point directly facing his house. Once the commander is eliminated, exit out of the mission zone by helicopter and redo the mission until her bond level gets high enough for you to develop the silenced Guilty Butterfly (extremely useful for non-lethal takedowns of bases and outposts).

One of these game mechanics is the use of the Fulton Recovery System. Without this, there’s no way that you can hope to extract D-Dog in the next step.;
, After completing Episode 3, have your helicopter pick you up at your Command Platform and proceed to your Aerial Command Center (ACC). Once at the ACC, you’ll need to open up your iDroid and go to your mission list to choose Episode 4: C2W., When taking on this mission for the first time, you are presented with only one option for your landing zone. Drop over this landing zone to start the mission.

, You should hear a puppy barking right after you disembark from your chopper. The noise will almost always originate near the tree that’s closest to where you landed. Go ahead and move to the location of the noise and you should find a cute puppy wagging it’s tail at you.

, Take out your tranquilizing pistol and shoot the puppy. After he falls asleep, get close to him so that you can then extract him using the Fulton Recovery System.If you listen to Miller’s instructions over your iDroid at the start of this mission, he will inform you of the puppy’s presence.

, Now that you’ve extracted D-Dog, you will need to wait a while for him to grow up. While waiting for this to happen, take on the main story missions and side ops first. Ocelot will ask you to get back to Mother Base to check on D-Dog’s growth twice. The first time is usually after you complete Episode 5 and some side ops. The second time you get called back will be sometime before Episode 7 or 8, and you should now have D-Dog available as your buddy.

, As soon as he’s available, make sure to take D-Dog with you on missions. By doing this, you get to increase your bond level with your buddy. Doing so will also unlock development for equipment that will allow D-Dog to kill, stun, and even use the Fulton Recovery System on enemies and vehicles."

Remember your surroundings.,
Make silent kills.,
Take advantage of your own controller.,
Hide bodies.,
Use evasive maneuvers.,
When in doubt, save.",How to Take Advantage of Being Stealthy in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty," It is always a good idea to make sure you are one step ahead of your enemies.


Always activate the network to view radar data. (This does not happen on Easy mode, but only once with a required cutscene.)
Keep your eyes on both the radar feed and your surroundings in the 3D general view. If you notice an enemy, but not in their field of vision, you can fall back and run for cover.
Be aware that your footsteps can be heard on certain materials. Keep focused on that material you seem to be ""happy"" about.;
, You don't need to attract attention to yourself by an un-suppressed firearm.


The choking method (when no weapons are equipped) is always a great way of silently killing your enemies.
Using a tranquilizer can also help, as not only can it drive unsuspecting enemies to sleep, but also is suppressed.
When using weapons, always conserve ammo in case you need that ammo for larger groups.
If you have no ammo in any guns, and choking is not an option, using martial art like moves can also help you out of a situation. If you fail to knock out a soldier, or flee after the soldier gets up, you will be in caution status, and that also brings reinforcements.

, It may just control your character, but your controller can also be an advantage when using certain items, or being found out by an enemy.


Your controller has a vibration function to assist Snake and Raiden on enemy movements.
Using the heartbeat sensor will lose the ability for other vibration functions while equipped.
If you are unable to determine your controller's actions, you should be on high alert.
The controller can also be your lifesaver for a tragic event, like holding your breath during a choke event, or preventing drowning. (While underwater, tap the Triangle button repeatedly to prevent fast O2 drainage.)

, They will raise you to caution status if any are found.


Try using storage rooms that are restricted by level keys. It's also best to hide them in dark rooms or inside closets.
Make sure nobody else is around when moving them. You are defenceless while carrying bodies.
You must be unequipped of your weapon in hand to move the body.

, Believe it or not, you can survive longer if using evasive maneuvers in large gangs.


These maneuvers also knocks down an enemy in your direction. Surely you'll be shot at, but that will prevent being ganged on.
Try evasive maneuvers in multiple directions. One direction will get you shot at much more faster.

, Make sure you've lost sight before saving.


The frequency for saves is 140.96.
Always save over your save file, unless you intend to make a new save. This conserves space in your system.
Make sure to save frequently. If you have low health, regenerate your health to about 25% before saving.
Avoid being near any enemy before saving. Though nobody but you can hear the conversations.

"
"
Prepare.,
Immediately syringe yourself (L2 to syringe and X) and then switch to rations if this isn't a BBE or other elite emblem run.,
Run straight forwards and up the stairs to the right ignoring all the Haven troopers.,
If its your first run; use the M4 to attack both dolls, either is good.

,
If it's a return attempt; use your M4 on the Mantis doll (red doll) only.

,
Scope.,
Eventually she will make Meryl attack you via the medium of cut scene.,
A second cut scene should eventually begin where Meryl is forced to attempt to take her own life.,
Eventually she will drop a doll, immediately drop your scope and run for the doll.,
If it was your first run, proceed to take down the second doll, and then use the Mantis doll on Mantis, as previously explained (Hold L1, and shake).,
Once her Armour falls another B&B sequence will ensue, kill or tranquilize her as necessary.",How to Beat Screaming Mantis in Metal Gear Solid 4," Make sure you have the M4 equipped with plenty of ammo. Even if this is a no kills run do this, you won't harm your efforts. The firing rate should be set to automatic. Buy a scope for your M4 if you haven't already, again vital, it should cost you 17500DP. If you can't afford this use the M14 if available and set to semi-auto. Buy a grip if you can, this will greatly benefit you. Now equip the Mosin Nagant, if you don't have it equip the M870 Custom with ring shots, or stun grenades. Failing all those just use the syringe, it is the most effective means (will be explained) but the most dangerous.;
, If it is, then switch to the Solid Eye for the time being. The Syringe is acceptable to use in an emblem run.

, If this is your first time and its not an emblem run by all means take down any that get in your way from this point, however if its an emblem run remember they all count as kills even the dead ones (ones that fall and die when you tranquilize). Once your on the top viewing area, check all the passages for rations, there's a total of 3, one of which is next to a column to the right. If you don't need rations continue.

,,, The scope will make everything easier, also going to options and making the movement speed of everything to 10 is a great help. Keep firing at your doll, and when she screams ""Snake"" drop the scope view and run. She will then fly at you, and miss, use this opportunity to fire at the dolls unprotected. She may do 2 attacks in sequence, be ready for that. She will also fire blades, there's not a lot you can do but try to avoid them. They do major damage in Extreme mode.

, This is phase 2. Take Meryl down with the M870, or if you can get to her, grab her round the neck and jam the syringe into her. Then take this opportunity to attack Mantis' dolls further. Keep running from Meryl, keep firing and preventing Mantis from attacking. During this phase she will frequently use Meryl and Haven soldiers to defend the dolls. Shooting them in the foot once or twice shouldn't kill them, if you don't mind killing Mantis soldiers, kill them and keep firing through you'll likely hit the doll. The tranquilize weapons might be a bit slow but if your aims good by all means use that to move the bodies.

, Fire at Meryl with the Mosin Nagant. If you don't have the Mosin Nagant, take her down with the M870 or the syringe (grab and stab). Make sure her stamina bar (psyche is you will) in at 0 before you resume your attack of the dolls. She will use bodies to defend the dolls less now.

, Once you have the doll; assuming its your first time, you should return to the top viewing area and resume attacking the second and final doll until she drops it. In extreme mode she can re-spawn dolls. If you found taking the doll down easy, this is good way to get DP. However if this is your first run you won't be able to do this. If it's a second or further run, you should have just taken down the Mantis doll. If you wish you can take down the second doll for DP. Otherwise attack Mantis with her doll, hold L1 and shake the controller while she jerks around until her life bar hits 0.

, There won't be any further cut scenes, until shes dead.

, Congratulations you've defeated Screaming Mantis.

For all the other versions, try the Snow camo.;
, It's recommended that you equip the motion sensor and the SVD, or for non-lethal kills you can use the Mosin Nagent/EZ Gun/MK22. As an alternative to the motion sensor, use the thermal goggles.


Do not equip any weapon at the start of the fight. The Boss will use Close Quarters Combat (CQC) and unless you counter it, your gun (and bones) will be broken and you will have to waste time getting the gun and ammo back.

, Use the motion sensor to find out where The Boss is. If you see anything moving quickly, that's her. If you can't find her on the motion sensor, look around. She is usually peeking out behind a tree. Keep your eyes open.

, Remember that you have only 10 minutes to beat her, so aim for her head to make the most out of every shot. You will be able to shoot her three times before she falls to the floor. When that happens, run! She will use her Patriot and shoot at the spot where you shot her. Continue this until she dies.

Once your chopper drops you in the mission area’s landing zone, you will get a notification from Miller that someone has attacked your Mother Base. If you Check the mission list on your iDroid, you’ll now see Episode 22: Retake the Platform.
, You now have the option to go back to Mother Base or continue with Episode 21. If you take the former option, you’ll be transported back to one of the platforms at your Mother Base for the start of Episode 22.

It’s also possible to continue with Episode 21 and disregard Miller’s message to take back one of your Mother Base’s platforms for Episode 22. Like with other missions in the game, you can still proceed to Episode 22 after you’ve completed Episode 21.
Although you can opt to not take Episode 22, not having an FOB as a result of this decision will severely limit your acquisition of personnel. This also means you’ll have to spend more time managing your current personnel (dismissing lower-ranked soldiers) as opposed to progressing through the game.
The game gives you a lot of freedom in choosing and taking missions. As long as the missions are available on your iDroid’s mission list, you can take them in any order (as well as re-take them to get higher ratings). Other than to give you the ability to build FOBs, completing Mission/Episode 22 first before Episode 21 will not give you any additional GMP or resources.

, The main objective of this mission is to eliminate the invading enemy force’s commander. You can go into this mission with guns blazing, or you can also opt for the silent approach provided the main objective is met., After eliminating the commander, Miller will inform you about creating Forward Operating Bases. Go to your iDroid and look for the Base Facilities option under the Mother Base tab., Use the shoulder buttons on your controller (RB and LB for Xbox 360/Xbox One; R1 and L1 for PS3/PS4) to navigate from the Mother Base sub-tab to the FOB sub-tab. Now navigate to the Purchase option and then press on the X (PS3/PS4) or A (Xbox 360/Xbox One) button on your controller., The game initially gives you three locations to purchase territorial waters. Don’t get too caught up with their differences and just choose one that you’re most comfortable with. Once you’ve purchased the territorial water of your choice, Miller will then inform you of the creation of a Security Unit tasked with guarding it., Similar to Mother Base, you can have a maximum of 4 platforms per unit/team on an FOB to increase your personnel capacity. Adding another FOB though, is a different matter. You’ll need to buy or earn MB Points if you wish to purchase the additional territorial waters location needed to set up a second FOB., There are three side ops that will become available once you’ve set up the first platform for you FOB. Take on these missions to get the blueprints for the Anti-theft Device, UA Drone, and IR Sensor., Once you’re able to acquire the blueprints, open up your iDroid and start development on them immediately. You can find them in the Development option under the Mother Base tab. Similar to Venom Snake’s weapons and items, security devices and equipment have their own GMP and specific unit requirements., Always use your int-scope to determine a soldier’s rating (whether you’re on a side op, main mission, or just free roaming). Take down and Fulton extract soldiers with B or higher combat or R&D ratings so that you’d have people to assign to your Security Unit and to hasten development on the weapons, equipment, and security devices to be used on the FOB., Soldiers with high combat ratings will automatically get designated to the Combat Unit (after some time in the brig). Open up your iDroid and then check your Combat Unit personnel in Staff Management under the Mother Base tab.

The game will usually assign soldiers with low stats from other teams/units to your Security team. Dismiss soldiers with E ratings so as to improve your chances of defending your FOB platform during invasions.

, Use the Right Trigger or R2 on your controller to sort your personnel in the Combat Unit in descending order. Individually pick soldiers with C, B, and A combat ratings by pressing A or X on the controller and then transfer them to the Security Unit.

There is a drawback for adding high-level personnel (soldiers with A+ or higher ratings) to the Security Unit to patrol FOB platforms. Players who invade your platform can either kill them or use the Fulton Recovery System on them to steal them from you. Consequently, your Security Unit’s level will fall down as a result of either of these actions.

, Since other players can invade your FOB, you need to make sure to set the preparedness level on its platforms at maximum. To do this, open up the iDroid again and go to Security Settings under the Mother Base tab., You should now be in a page that shows your FOBs and the platforms under them. Choose one platform and go into its basic settings to set the preparedness level to high or highest. This ensures that the platform has the best soldiers and security equipment available all the time.

Take note that by setting the preparedness level to the highest setting, you will have to shell out more GMP.

, Have your security personnel use weapons that are best suited to the platform that they’re patrolling. Go to your platform’s Advanced Settings tab and make sure to set the security personnel’s weapons to either short-ranged (shotguns), medium-ranged (automatic rifles), or long-ranged (sniper rifles).

Short-ranged weapons are best for security placed in the Command platform due to it being more confined. On the other hand, medium-ranged and long-ranged weapons would serve personnel stationed on the Medical platforms better due to how spacious the areas can get.

Upgrade your Fulton and Int-Scope.,
Go back to extracting additional personnel.",How to Manage Mother Base in Metal Gear Solid V," This mission will introduce you to the basics of using your iDroid as well as to using the Fulton Recovery System. The latter is important because it will make extracting personnel easier and more efficient., Immediately take on a mission once you finish Episode 2. Go to the mission lists on your iDroid and choose to take the first mission or side op that you fancy. If you’d rather get familiar with Afghanistan and the controls even more, then you might also want to free-roam.

, Bases and outposts that have 4 or more soldiers will usually have specialists and prisoners. Once you’re on a mission, side op, or just free-roaming, always make sure to interrogate soldiers by pressing on the LB (XBox One/XBox 360) or L1 (PS4/PS3) when holding them up with your weapon or choking them. You should then see the location of specialists or prisoners on your iDroid’s map.

, Proceed to the location of the specialists and/or prisoners and use the Fulton Recovery System on them. Some specialists and prisoners will have high stats/ratings, allowing the Mother Base unit you designate them in to level up faster., Your Mother Base will start out with only a Command Platform and R&D, Support, and Base Development units. By completing the main story missions, you will get to unlock units and platforms that will not only allow you to add more people to your Mother Base, but also aid you in the development of weapons, items, and equipment., Manually check available platforms by opening up your iDroid and navigating to Base Facilities under the Mother Base tab. You should now see which platforms are available, how much they cost, and the time it takes to complete their construction.


Miller will inform you of the creation of a unit and its respective platform’s availability at the end of a mission.

, Ideally, you should have enough GMP from finishing missions and side ops to construct a platform once it’s available. If for some reason you lack GMP, then you should try to replay some of the main missions that you’ve already done or search for diamonds in enemy bases and outposts when in free-roam.


Getting an S-Rank in a mission while completing all of its objectives will give you lots of GMP. You can also get GMP in free-roam by interrogating soldiers for the location of an outpost’s diamonds and other resources.

, Now that you have platforms for your units, you can then proceed to the oftentimes grueling task of managing them. Open up your iDroid and look for “Staff Management” under the Mother Base tab.

, To manage the personnel for these units, navigate to their respective tabs under Staff Management by using RB and LB (XBox One/XBox 360) or R1 and L1 (PS4/PS3).

, You can then press on the RB (XBox One/XBox 360) or R2 (PS4/PS3) button to sort the existing personnel under the unit you want to manage. This allows you to sort personnel based on their compatibility with their existing units.

, If one of your personnel has higher stats/ratings for units other than the one he/she is currently in, then you’ll need to transfer him/her there. To do so, press on the Change Assignment (A for Xbox One/Xbox 360 or X for PS4/PS3) button when the personnel’s name is highlighted and choose “Move” among the options that pop-up on your screen to transfer him/her to a unit where he/she has better compatibility., The Staff Management menu also gives you the option to dismiss personnel who have the Troublemaker special skill as well those with low (E) ratings/stats. To deal with these personnel, highlight his/her name and press on the Change Assignment (A for Xbox One/Xbox 360 or X for PS4/PS3) button on your controller to bring up the option to dismiss him/her.


A Troublemaker will cause problems in the their respective units and should be dealt with lest you end up with personnel developing PTSD and getting sent to your Mother Base’s Sickbay.
Don’t worry about dismissing a Troublemaker even if he has a high rating. As you progress through the game and upgrade your Fulton and Int-Scope, you will find it easier to come across soldiers who have higher ratings.

, Move compatible personnel with C or higher ratings/stats to the R&D, Intel, and Support units. Once these units level up, navigate to the Mother Base tab on your iDroid and upgrade your Fulton and Int-Scope by going to the Weapons/Items option found under “Development.”


Upgraded versions of the Fulton will allow you to extract vehicles, children, as well as increase the amount you can carry with you when you’re at any of the mission areas.
An upgraded Int-Scope will allow players to analyze and determine an enemy soldier’s ratings. Aside from the Analyzer function, it will also have a directional Microphone function allowing the player to easily pick up on enemy conversations while doing reconnaissance without having to be close to a base or outpost.

, Once you’ve upgraded your Int-Scope and Fulton, you can proceed to extract more personnel to add to Mother Base. Coupled with the upgraded Fulton, an upgraded Int-Scope’s analyzer function will make it easier for you to identify and extract more specialists and high-level soldiers without having to resort to interrogations.


You don’t need to be in Mother Base to manage Mother Base. You can manage your staff as well as construct platforms anywhere and anytime in-game (excluding during cutscenes) using your iDroid.

Realize that investing any points in energy is a huge waste.,
Strength is mostly important for physical damage, and wearing gear.,
Dexterity impacts your attack rating(how often you hit) and increases damage for ranged weapons.,
Another point about dexterity and blocking- it depends on the shield you have.,
Vitality is an obviously one of the most important stats.,
Resistances are very vital to your characters progress as well.,
Always use the act 2 Mercenaries, their auras are too useful to not have.

,
Always plan your character out before you make it.",How to Rock at Diablo 2," Most items in the game should prevent you from ever having to put mana in. Also, if you have the expansion, collect +mana charms.;
, This varies hugely amongst different players, depending on their current equipment and their requirements of str to wear the gear they saved for their character.

, Dexterity is also VERY important for your blocking with shields. Go to your character screen and check your chance to block, to ensure you're not lacking in dexterity.

, Don't waste your time trying to get 75%(max) blocking on a shield that only has 30 percent chance to block. Be careful on that.

, Once you're happy with your other stats, ALWAYS dump the rest into vitality. The difference between progress and failure is a huge factor with vitality. The more you have, the more you can take. Don't even try Hell Mode unless you have at least 1000 life.

, Always look for items that gives you resistances, save every small charm that gives more than +5 of any resistance.

,, Most skills in your skill tree have synergies. Synergies are other skills that compliment and improve the other skill. For example. i want to be an ice sorcerer. So If i put 20 points in ice bolt, my damage for blizzard is 20x15+ damage on level 1! Study your skill tree for your character. And plan what synergies are important for the main skills you want to use later.

Take on a mission or free-roam.,
Neutralize and interrogate a guard/guards.,
Check your iDroid.,
Extract the marked diamonds and resources.",How to Earn Lots of Money (GMP) in Metal Gear Solid V1," When on your ACC (Aerial Command Center), open up your iDroid and go to your Mission tab. You can then opt to deploy for a main story mission, a side-op, or just free-roam.#Infiltrate a base or outpost. Once you’ve deployed yourself to the mission area (or when you’re free-roaming), look for the nearest base or outpost. If you’re new to the game, start with smaller outposts first to get a feel of how to best infiltrate.
, Use your tranquilizer pistol to headshot the guards and drag him to an area just outside of outpost/base. Once there, wake the guard by kicking him while at the same time pointing your weapon at his back. Hold on to the LB (XBox) or L1 (PS4) button on your controller to bring up the Interrogation menu and navigate to the “Spit it out” option.

Do the same for all guards until you have the location of all the diamonds/resources in the base or outpost.
Make sure to kick or tranquilize the guard/soldier again after interrogating him so that you can Fulton him.
You can also opt to get behind a guard with your gun trained on his back and hold him up. After interrogating the guard, you can proceed to incapacitate him with your tranquilizing pistol or with CQC.
Soldiers will sometimes give you the location of their base’s specialist. Make sure to extract these special soldiers using the Fulton Recovery System so that you can add them to your staff at Mother Base. They will be helpful later for developing new weapons and equipment.

, After interrogating all of the soldiers in a base or outpost, your iDroid should now show the locations of diamonds and other resources in that area. Now place a marker on these locations using the RT (XBox) or R2 (PS4) button and proceed to their location., With the markers you placed earlier as a guide, go over to the locations of the diamonds and other resources and extract them using the B (XBox) or O (PS4) button. Unlike the resources found in materials containers, the diamonds and resources you’ll find in bases and outposts can be extracted without using the Fulton Recovery system.If you didn’t Fulton extract the soldiers you incapacitated earlier, make sure you go about extracting the diamonds and other resources before they wake up.
The locations of most materials resources will permanently show on your iDroid for future missions. You can return to these locations in later playthroughs of the game and still find the diamonds and other resources there (or in close proximity to where you first found them).
The GMP value of a diamond is determined by its size and is automatically added to your Mother Base GMP. A small diamond (S) will give you 10000 GMP while a large one (L) is worth 100000 GMP. On the other hand, raw and processed materials are important for Mother Base’s development as well as for Venom Snake’s weapons and equipment. You can sell the surplus processed materials to further augment your base’s GMP.
Extracting animals will also result in a reward ranging from 500 GMP to 200000 GMP (depending on the animal’s rarity).
You can also find diamonds in Mother Base hidden in the most unlikely of places (air ducts, railings, and catwalks).

Use this to extract as many personnel for your R&D team as possible so that you can get the Cargo +2 upgrade.

The Cargo +2 Fulton upgrade will also require that you extract the Transportation Specialist found at Lamar Khaate Palace (Episode/Mission 10).

, Once you’ve upgraded your Fulton, you can now extract tanks, jeeps, anti-aircraft gun emplacements, and materials containers easily regardless if you’re on a mission or free-roaming in the Afghanistan and Angola-Zaire maps., Although vehicles can be used for missions, it’s best to sell them off for GMP. Open up your iDroid and sell your surplus tanks, walker gears, placeable weapons (anti-air gun emplacements), and other resources from the Resources option under the Mother Base tab.

Selling a tank will net you 50000 GMP while Walker Gears can fetch up to 70000 GMP. Trucks and jeeps can be sold for about 20000–50000 GMP (depending on the model) but are also easy to find in bases and outposts in both Angola-Zaire and Afghanistan (compared to tanks and Walker Gears).
Resources are a bit iffy to sell off because they’re important for developing platforms on Mother Base as well as Venom Snake’s weapons and equipment. It’s recommended that you sell them off only when you’ve constructed all of your Mother Base’s platforms.

Of course, don’t forget to extract more soldiers from your missions or when you infiltrate bases/outposts while free-roaming., Send you combat unit staff on Combat Deployment missions using your iDroid. Go to the Missions tab and look for a Combat Deployment option. Like main missions and side ops, these missions will also give you GMP as well as other resources that your Mother Base needs.

Some of these missions are also helpful in disrupting the supply of weapons (sniper rifles) and equipment (helmets, night vision goggles) to your enemies.

, Your staff’s combat unit rating will affect their chances of succeeding in a mission. Choose staff with B or higher ratings to minimize the projected losses for a specific mission as much as possible., By completing this mission, you’ll get to build your first FOB, or Forward Operating Base.

If you want, don't put wings on. You will FALL through the hole and the game will restart.;
, When you complete a level, when the Starite (objective to get in the game) appears, use a Pregnant potion on it. Please back up. When it gives birth, if you are too close, you may pick up the real starite. When it gives birth, the real starite will be skinny and motherly. Pick up the other starite. When you do the game freezes and sometimes crashes :)

, Type in 'neogaf"". You get a small little ball that you can ride. Sometimes, it ends up being immovable.

, There is a goal to use the ""secret adjective"" on Super Scribblenauts. It is ""Scribblenautical"". That adjective is now going to be used. Spawn a rock, glue, and a Win Button. Carefully place the rock on the button. You get a random 5th Cell Developer with a rooster helmet that looks like Maxwell's hair style. Use different rocks (pebble, boulder, stone, etc.), for different people or sometimes animals.

, Spawn a Time Machine. Go to world 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 over and over again in any order. You can even do them twice in a row. Eventually, You will go to a secret world with a Starite in a tree. There is a Doppelganger that looks like you that ISN'T the evil twin! It has red hair and blue shirt!! Amazing! Use a handheld potion. Use it on ""Maxwell"". Pick him up. go back to the playground using the time machine. You will still have him. Now you have a Maxwell to play with! Use a cloning ray (AKA: Clone Ray) on him. do it over and over again. This only works on Super Scribblenauts. But on Scribblenauts Remix, type in ""me"" or ""Maxwell"" or ""evil twin"" or ""doppelganger"". Give him the ""scared"" adjective. His run is so hilarious. Also, on Scribblenauts, (the first version where you aren't allowed to use adjectives), Type in ""evil twin"". place him on the ground. Characters seem to put their hand up to their head. Maxwell's evil twin has unattached his body parts, then quickly back together, His movement looks like he is being scared, or struck by lightning.

, Type in ""longcat"" and there is a cute white kitty with no hind legs popping out of a white cloud. It is so adorable. They seem to eat birds.

, Spawn ""me"" or ""Maxwell's notebook"". Take the notebook from the doppelganger then delete him or take it from the screen. Tap on yourself. Press ""use"" and it will show up a random object. Be careful though! I've experienced some aggressive and mean animals/people I've wished up! If you want a bull to attack you, and you get one from Maxwell's notebook, type in ""red shirt"", wear it, and the bull will attack you. If that doesn't work, hurt it.

, Spawn a ""Robosaur"". It is a robot dinosaur. If you want to ride it, either shoot it with a mind control device or just use the adjective ""kind"" or ""nice"" before you actually spawn it.

, Spawn a hot dude and a shield. Put the shield in front of the dude. Spawn a Freeze Ray. Shoot the shield. It should be frozen for a second, but since the dude is hot, his heat makes the shield cold. The dude should be warm. Then, place the warm dude in front of the shield. Shoot him with the Freeze Ray. He should freeze. Then the shield should freeze. Either the shield or the dude should flash until the other object is frozen.

, Apes can ride each other. Make sure you have nothing but Maxwell as an object in the screen. Type in ""ape"". Keep on making apes until the Budget Meter is full. Stack them all up on top of each other. You will get an ape tunnel.

, Type in ""Magic invincible gold sacred folding fan"" and then type in ""Medusa head"". Shoot the folding fan with the medusa head then use the folding fan, crosses will spawn from random places like meteors.They will also appear even if you cannot create any more objects.

, Make a ""Pool"" (of course) and make a gold object. The pool may appear yellow on certain conditions.

, Typed in a ""Katana"" (of course) then I typed in ""Bomb"" multiple times and set them on fire, the katana the became an alive happy katana it grabs things and turns them into starites. Pichu 904-founder of this glitch.

, Type in a person with an adjective for example, type in ""Blind guy"" and type in something magic, do not take the shades off, shoot him with the magic object (It can be ""Magic"" or ""Magic wand"" just anything magic.) Keep shooting him you will notice he is changed, every time he is shades will appear.

, It is the same thing as ""longcat"" only type in ""tacgnol"". A black version of longcat with a white X for his eye appears. It has the same traits and motions at Longcat, eat birds, everything. It may be Tacgnol is Longcat's nemesis, although they don't attack each other.

, If you type in ""Magic emerald frozen staff"" (Weapon staff) spawn a ""Fire"" then put the staff in the fire a fireman will appear the staff will no longer be emerald but on fire the fireman will extinguish both the fire and the staff.

, A hoe, scythe, and an axe are all that you really need. Save your rocks as you may need them for artificial fences. Clear out the area right next to your shipping bin because you want to harvest your crops as fast as possible. Since you do not have a shipping basket at this time, planting crops in a C plot will allow you the most time (A C is one horizontal row of three, one row of two, and one row of three). Create 4 plots with one square of space in between them and make sure to place them as close to the shipping bin as possible.

, During the cut scenes, your choices will affect your relationship with the girls. Now would be a good chance to familiarize yourself with the town but remember, time is money. Head to the supermarket and buy some turnip seeds. Turnips will grow the fastest and yields a good amount of profit. Four packets of turnip seeds should be the maximum amount of seeds you can buy at this point with five hundred G.

, Switch your scythe for a watering can and switch your axe for the seeds. Leave your house and go to your pond, which is located to the left of your tree. Refill your watering can and run back to where you planted your seeds. Water each square.

, There is a fork in the road when you initially reach the mountains. The stairs lead to a hot spring and a mine behind the waterfall. Straight down will lead you to a lake, a field of flowers, and the top of the mountains. Taking the path opposite of the stairs will lead you to Gotz the Woodcutter's house.

, One is up the stairs and the other is near Gotz's house. Place them in your rucksack. Take a bamboo shoot while you're at it. Now your rucksack and hands should be full. Run back to your farm and put your ""harvest"" into the shipping bin.

, You should still be carrying your hoe with you. ""Mine"" the land and occasionally, some ores will pop up or you will find a ladder down. The lower the level, the greater the chance of finding more expensive ores like the Blue Mysterile. You will probably have a hard time going to lower levels since your stamina is not that high yet. But if you are lucky, you will dig up a power berry here which will increase your stamina. If you find any ores, make sure to put it into your rucksack and ship it if you can make it to your bin in time. Otherwise, wait until tomorrow.

, Go home, pick up and put down your dog, check the weather, write in your diary, and sleep.

, When you wake up, water your crops, woo some girls, harvest the mountain crops, mine, and sleep. Eventually, you may want to plant a few fields of grass so clear some land in preparation of grass. With your extra stamina, chop the logs with your axe to gather some lumber. Note that you cannot chop the tree stumps yet.

, Barley brings the horse to your farm. Your objective is to plant many fields of grass (plan this well so your grass does not conflict with your other crops. A suggestion would be to start your grass stash in the bottom right corner of your farm and work outwards from there). Get 800 g to have enough money for a brush because you need to talk to the horse and brush the horse every day.

, In the spring, the only way you are going to get feed for chickens is by buying it from Popuri's mother. In the summer, you can use corn and put it in the water mill right next to the coop. Eventually, you can receive a free chicken if you woo Popuri enough so you can use your money solely for feed. Another opportunity comes up when Rick asks you to take care of a chicken for him and though you have to return the chicken, you can still keep the eggs and put them in the incubator. And the third option is you can buy your own chicken, but remember to have enough feed for it.

, Note: Have a store of fodder for your cow by cutting your grass when it is the darkest shade of green. This will ensure that you will not run out of fodder for your precious cows. Talk to and brush your cows every day.

, When you get animals, you can put them in there and they will not travel out! Then you can save your lumber for more important things like extensions or as presents to Gotz. Too many rocks? Store them in your cabinet once you extend your house.

, However, if it is one or the other, get a basket. It will play a key role in harvesting during summer.

, He hangs out at the Inn on Wednesdays and the weekends as long as it is not a holiday, so check it out. Pineapples are renewable so you do not have to constantly buy them. They do carry a hefty price tag though (1000g a pop)but you can sell it for 500g each.

, Have pineapple seeds before summer starts because you lose a day from the swimming festival. A word of warning: these pineapples take a long time to grow so your mountain harvests, chickens, and the livestock you have will come in very handy. Plant a field of corn right next to your chicken coop to be devoted for chicken feed and plant a few fields of tomatoes and corn or all corn, since corn should yield a larger profit than tomatoes. The reason you may want to plant both though is to get 100 of each crop shipped so you can get the special seeds for summer.

,, It looks like a thin stemmed mushroom and it is called a ""Truffle."" These yield approximately 1000G for each one so come to the mountain daily.

, This may be your busiest harvesting season and your most profitable, so get ready. Buy as many sweet potato seeds as you have fields.

, You also should have over 10 patches of grass. Harvest your grass when the time comes because nothing grows during the winter season.

, While putting your concentration on your animals, upgrade your axe up to the blue level (in one sitting. Look at tips below). Chop the wood and make sure you have enough lumber and extend your farm up to the level of hothouse if possible.

, Hopefully, you have wooed two girls at least up to a purple or blue heart (while focusing on your girl).

, The lake has frozen so bring your basket and hoe and mine to your heart's content. Adamantite is used for the mayo maker, the cheese maker, and the yarn maker. The Orichalcum is for getting a girl's accessory.

, You can get married only if your house is extended to the max.

, Hopefully by now, you know what to do. Repeat the above steps as necessary and experiment a little yourself. Happy Farming!

When you start, be sure to name your character something you'll want to be called throughout the whole game.,

Do this plan everyday unless it rains.,
Create the first rainbow.,

Be creative and make sure to save your money.",How to Play Harvest Moon Tree of Tranquility," You can also choose one of the default names.;
, Yes, the whole idea is to farm, but you don't have to be a farmer. You can be a rancher, or a nurse, or a fisherman. Or anything really. Some places you just work part time, and the farming is where you do the real work. If you want to fish a lot, try the seaside plot, the seaside plot also has a large planting area, so if you decide to grow plants too, you'll be ready. The town plot is nice if you work in town. It doesn't have a ton of room to plant, but it's enough to plant a nice flower garden. The hillside plot is nice if you're either a blacksmith, woodworker, but it mainly works well for gardeners. All are good places to raise animals.

, When you have X's over your eyes, head to the hot spring. (It's near Carmel Falls. Just up the slanted rocks) Bathe in it to restore your energy. Of course, you can only use it once a day. Nothings perfect. Once all your weeds are picks, plow six spots. Then six beside those. (All in a row) Then take out your potato seeds, and plant them. They each have six seeds per throw.

, After you water them, you can use the hot springs again. Remember, only once a day.

, After your done watering for the day, you can go talk to people. (Remember those people that sparkled? You can marry those people.) Pick your favorite out of the little booklet from the game case. If the person you like is not in your town:

, To create the first rainbow, ship 1000G worth of stuff. The mayor will then come and talk to you. Ship ANOTHER 1000G. The mayor will now tell you a story. Talk to Gill about it. He wants you to upgrade your house first. Make 3000G and go talk to Dale, then upgrade your house. Talk to Gill again. He tells you some important stuff. Talk to the Mayor again. Find the other half of the quilt. (It's in the clock tower located in the town square.) Water the flower under the big tree near the clock. Do what the little elf asks. Presto, you have a rainbow.

, Now people will start moving in. Once you find the one your want to marry, talk to them everyday, work at the place they work at. (Part time job) give them stuff, and talk to them every time you see them. They will warm up to you and then later ask to be your girlfriend/boyfriend. Once they are up to eight hearts, the Mayor will tell you about the Blue Bird, and the blue feather. If you see the blue bird around your house, go to Carmel falls. You'll find the feather and you can ask your boyfriend/girlfriend to marry you. (Don't worry, they will say yes.) After a whole year of being married, you'll have a kid. (You can pick if it's a girl or boy. When you wife/husband asks you to come pray about the kid, do it, then pick the gender. Easy right? You can also pick a 50/50 chance of both if you wish)

, Try saving your money for a whole year, not buying anything except seeds. And fish as much as you can. You'll have so much money by the end of the year, you won't ever run out. Then, spend only little bits at a time, and you'll always have cash on hand.

Do patrol missions.,
Campaign.,
Upgrade and unlock.,
Tackle Bounties.,
Unlock Strikes.,
Do Crucible at level 5.,
Do the daily heroic mission.",How to Level Up in Destiny," The first patrol you unlock is patrol the Cosmodrome which is on Earth. By doing patrol, you can pick up missions. This missions are set on beacons. To identify a beacon, they will flash green. In order to locate one, pull out your Ghost and it will navigate beacons in your area. To identify this one, when you pull out your Ghost, there will be a gray mark with numbers next to it. That is where you would want to head for a mission. The numbers indicate how far away you are from that specific beacon.;
, The campaign in Destiny is quite entertaining and enjoyable. But also a good way of leveling up. You can do a story mission more than once. However many times you want. The first story you unlock is A Guardian Rises on Earth. The second one you unlock is Restoration. You can do these missions over and over killing enemies for the XP. XP is what you are aiming for. Also remember that meleeing enemies gives you extra XP rather than shooting or throwing grenades at your target.

, Upgrades on your weapons and gear give you a great amount of XP. They give a couple of XP, depending on how many upgrades you have of course. But not just that, you can also gain XP from upgrading subclasses.

, Bounties are one of the greatest ways of actually leveling up.You can choose between two sections of bounties: Vanguard or Crucible, depending on what level you are to reach Crucible. But for starters, stick to Vanguard bounties. Bounties objectives you have to complete. All bounties come in different tasks. By completing these Vanguard bounties the don't just give you XP to level up. But also reputation towards your Vanguard. That is also great for leveling up too. You can get bounties from the bounty tracker.

, Strikes are a better way of trying to level up than doing stories. Simply because strikes are much longer and have more effect. The first strike you unlock is the devils lair. Your target is the Sepiks Prime. There is always a boss to face in a strike, and you kill enemies along the way . Better and stronger enemies possibly. In the Devil Lair strike, at the beginning when you enter the terrestrial complex and go further on, then you will encounter great enemies to kill and will give you the XP you deserve. Remember, you can always do a strike more than once too. Just make sure you have at least three people on your fireteam; if not, then the game will search a fireteam available.

, Crucible is competitive multiplayer in Destiny. Once you start getting settled and welled enough into the game then you should start getting used to doing Crucible. Crucible will earn you XP and even weapons and gear. Crucible can be very effective to your Guardian.

, This is when a mission at random is selected and chosen as the daily heroic mission. The mission will apparently have the heroic modifier activated. When the heroic modifier is active, enemies will appear in greater numbers and are more aggressive according to Bungie.

For a week you will plan your wedding.",How to Marry Neil in Harvest Moon (ANB)," Neil will first arrive on Spring 9th of your first year to give you your first animal: A cow. Notice the little black heart on his left side of his chat box. This is his affection for you right now. The affection rises over time with gifts, communication, festivals and heart events.;
, Talk to him every day and give him his favorite gifts.There are lots of things he likes/loves but here is an easy list:


Loved: Yak Milk, Suffolk Wool, Llama Wool, Silkie Egg (Yaks, Suffolk Sheep and Llamas are not able to be purchased at the start of the game).
Liked: Once again there are lots of things he likes. But, one easy item to give him is Fodder (he sells animal products so you could just buy fodder from him and give it, or you can purchase grass seeds and grow it yourself). He also likes any kind of wool from sheep, not to mention cow/chicken/sheep treats and Pet/Chicken feed.
Disliked: Giving Neil a gem or ore, flowers and perfume will result in a loss of FP.
Hated: He hates Poison Mushrooms, and any kind of dessert and Tea.
Horror: This is the worst gift to give him. Giving him Chocolate Cake will result in an anger point being accumulated, along with losing 800FP.

, Earlier, you should have noticed the color of his heart--black. This is the starting color for all bachelors. As you give him gifts and talk to him/win festivals, the color will rise. In fact, it will have a higher rise if you answer the correct answer in his heart events.

,


Black is 0-9,999 Friendship Points.
Purple is 10,000-19,999 Friendship Points.
Blue is 20,000-29,999 Friendship Points (at this color, you can become his girlfriend).
Green is 30,000-39,999 Friendship Points.
Yellow is 40,000-49,999 Friendship Points.
Pink is 50,000-59,999 Friendship Points; and
Red is 60,000-65,535 Friendship Points. At this time you can get married.

, This happens when you give him his horror gift (Chocolate Cake), ignore him or choose the wrong answer during his heart events. If five are collected, he will not get out of bed for the whole day.

, These determine if you deserve to marry Neil. Here are the events:


Black Heart Event: You see Neil arguing with someone over a sick cow. Soon you will go through the dialogue and be presented two choices. Choose 'What about the sick cow?' and you will not build up AP and lose FP. Choose the other option and you will.
Purple Heart Event: This requires more things. First you must need to have unlocked Rod, who owns a pet shop. You will see Neil playing with a dog, showing he has a much softer side for animals. Then, he sees you and asks how long you've been here, watching him. Select 'I just got here' to gain FP. If you select the option that says you saw him, he will get angry at you. Rod later tells you the better choice could have been pretending to have just gotten there.
There is no blue heart event, but when his heart is blue, you can become his girlfriend. You can give him the commitment ring on Saturday or Sunday, between 8 AM to 11 PM. Alternatively he can ask himself. Rejecting him will cause 1 AP.
For the green heart, He will be chasing a cow. Help him find it and select the answer 'Because I like you Neil'. You can also choose the other option for 1000 FP, but 1 AP will be collected as well.
Yellow heart: This is his final event. He will be gazing at a waterfall with you, and says how he likes to go here to forget about bad things. If you ask him what kinds, he will be angry at you because he's just forgotten them and you want to remind him of them again. Instead, select 'I understand totally.', and he will be glad that you didn't ask about his problems.

, Build the double bed as well.

, This means he will propose to you.

, You can choose if he should wear a Black, Grey or White Tuxedo, and if you should wear a newer wedding dress or a traditional one. After the wedding scene he is your spouse.

, Do this every season for a nice heap of gold. Seeds can be bought over the telephone at Karen's Supermarket.

, There are 10 different fields. After your crops are watered, collect more weeds and wild grasses to sell. Chop some branches and stones if you have enough stamina left.

, After a few seasons, you should have enough money to have Gotz build you an animal shed or a chicken coop. A chicken coop will make you more money to begin with.


If you collected enough lumber or material stone, you won't have to buy materials, saving you LOTS of money.
After your coop is completed, buy a chicken. Use your telephone to call the Poultry Farm to buy some bird feed for rainy days. Your chicken will be at the front of your farm near the shipping bin.
Use some stones or lumber to build a small fenced-in area near the chicken coop. If you have enough money you should buy some grass seeds to plant in this area. When it isn't raining or snowing, you can leave your chicken outside so it can feed itself, saving you the hassle of buying more and more bird feed.
When it is bad weather, remember to bring it inside and feed it yourself or else it will get sick.
When your chicken lays its first egg, DO NOT sell it. Go inside of the chicken coop and place the egg in the incubator (on the far left wall). In a few days another chicken will hatch. Until then, you can sell the other eggs.
Repeat this process until you have four chickens; then you can sell one or more of the chickens for an easy 500G or so and then start again.

, You can get a fishing rod from Galen (the old man with the hairnet) after you talk to him and his wife Nina at least once and then go to his house around noon on a sunny Saturday with nothing equipped.

Collect Snowballs and Ore stone during the Winter.",How to Make Money in Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar," You've probably figured this on out but a good way to make money is to sell crops. Make sure to fertilize your plants every day and water them twice if possible. If you've already gotten the 2nd expansion you can buy tree seeds. Tea leaves can be processed into tea. If you have a grape tree than you can use the windmills to make it into wine. Trees might take a while to grow though they usually take about 1-2 months.;
, Animals can help you make money if you use their products. For example cows make milk, chickens lay eggs etc.

, You can cook items your animals make. For example, if you cook milk and an egg, you get pudding. You can get recipes at the cafe when you buy items. Some recipes cannot be cooked without certain appliances. You can buy kitchen appliances at the bazaar.

, If you're really desperate for money, jump in the river. Most of the time you'll either find junk or nothing. But if you're lucky you can find sea urchins, or gold. Another thing you can find is ore stones. NEVER sell ore stones. Instead save when you go to bed and break it with your hammer in the morning. Keep trying until you get the ore/jewel you want.

, Felix gives you the fishing rod in summer year 1.Fish are usually cheap but some are not. Some fish can be cooked for more money. Fishing during a storm can get you better fish.

, If you find a honeycomb put it in the windmill, or with an egg and some oil you can make mayonnaise. There are lots of different things to make with the windmill. If you have the right ore's you can make jewelry which sells for high prices

, If you have unlocked the 3rd windmill you can make grass seeds. To make them just put fodder and fertilizer in the 3rd windmill. The grass seeds sell for 500g each.

, you can throw snowball to the ground to Ore stone, curry dumpling, flower, etc. you can break Ore stone with hammer to get jewel or ore to upgrade your tool, making a necklace or brooch,etc, or sell them for quick money.

Collect items from the forest.,
Hit the mine.,
Farm.,
Hatch eggs to get free chickens.",How to Get Rich in Harvest Moon: Back to Nature," Just exploring the forest every day to collect free items is definitely worth your time. Item prices are different depending on their category, also every category has high priced items. Especially in the fall, if you collect all the items in this season, you will get at least 1000G per day.;
, Since you don’t have to invest any money, and also because the game time is stopped when you are in the mine, this is the easiest way for a beginner to earn money:


At the beginning of the game (especially when you haven’t had the bin yet), your bag can carry only 3 items at a time. If you are running back and forth from the mine to the farm to sell the three best priced ores, you are doing it wrong. All you need to do is mine around the first floor of the mine for the 10G bags. These bags are automatically collected and changed to the gold immediately after you get them
Buy the bin first. After playing for a while, you might get annoyed from the bag that can carry only 3 items and you’ll want to buy the bigger one, but that is a mistake. Another bigger bag will allow you to carry 5 items, and you will need to buy the second bag so you can carry up to 9 items. Instead, you should buy the bin first, the price may seem high (the bin costs 5000G) but it can carry up to 30 items. The main reason for buying the bin is so you can go mining in the deeper floor and collect ores to sell for a higher price. Therefore, you can say that this is an investment for better living.







, You are an owner of the farm, why don’t you go farming? Every type of plant gives a different amount of profit. So, the trick is always to choose the best type of plant for that season, depending on its renewability and how quickly it grows.


The most profitable season for farming is fall. Also the sweet potato is the best plant since you can harvest it every 3 days. So, as long as you have free space in the farm, just plant sweet potato. This will lead you to spend time for hours to water all the plants, but it is the time that you will earn a ton of money and trust me, by the end of fall you will be a millionaire.

, You need to buy the first chicken and take care of it for a while to get the egg. But there is no need to buy other chickens to fill up the hen house since you can have more chicken by hatching eggs. Chickens are easy to care for, and they produce an egg every day. Also, you can throw egg in the hot springs to turn it into a spa-boiled egg which you can sell at a higher price.

When you first turn on your game, and you set up your file, the mayor will walk you through the town and give you a tour.,
You need to select which of these lovely young women is suited best for you.,
Be sure to make an effort to stop by and see them every day after work.,
When they are at a white heart be sure to visit them every day and give them gifts.,
By giving them a gift each day, you will increase their feelings for you.,
Each of the girls will have cut scenes that will trigger at different moments of the game.,
The next crucial cut scene will deal with a dream sequence and an act where you have to rescue her or help her.,
After you have completed these events, their heart levels should be yellow or bordering on pink.,
When you present the feather to her, expect the wedding to follow shortly after your proposal.",How to Get Married on Harvest Moon 64," There are five eligible bachelorettes. Each of these girls has a boy who will play your rival for her heart. For the first few days talk to all of the villagers and mainly seek out the bachelorettes. Elli can easily be found at the bakery, or outside with her grandmother. Karen you will find at the Vineyard on some occasions, the bar at night and at the beach after cut scenes with her father. Maria is always in the library except for Mondays when the Library is closed, she will be around the mountain area. Ann is always going to be at the Ranch in the field with her brother Gray. Popuri will be in the flower shop or outside watering the flowers.;
, Do you find Ann’s ranching attitude a match made in heaven for your farm life? Perhaps the love for novels and short stories attract you to Maria. When you have made your decision on which of the girls you decide to marry you need to find out what they like. Elli loves milk and eggs. Karen loves any kinds of berries that you find in the mountain area. Maria loves bugs and cabbage. Ann true to her ranching nature loves corn and wool. Popuri loves flowers; all of the girls will accept flowers as well.

, Note they will not be available on festival days for anything you give them will not contribute to their heart level, only how you interact. Their heart level indicates how they feel about you. Each girl will start out with white, which means neutral. As you progress through the courtship the color will turn blue, which means friendly. Once you hit a green heart, you know you are getting somewhere. Green means flirtatious, and will change to yellow. Yellow means they are falling in love with you. The last color is pink which means they are completely in love with you.

, These gifts do not have to be their favorite gifts but be sure to give them something every day.


Especially on birthdays.
Elli – 1st day of Fall
Karen -11th day of Winter
Ann-14th day of Summer
Maria- 11th day of Winter
Popuri-22nd day of Spring.

, When a festival arises visit her and if there is a dance at that festival, choose her to dance with you.

, However, the most notable two are when you have reached a yellow heart. Your lovely lady will fall sick, and you must visit her at her house. This is triggered with a green heart or with a yellow heart. If you skip too quickly to a yellow heart, the scene will still come. This will increase her affection for you.

, Each of the rescue cut scene is different but your character will have a dream the night before indicating the whereabouts of this scene you must activate. This cut scene is very crucial and will boost the heart level more than any gift you give. Be sure not to miss this! All of them can be found in places to complete the dream event: Elli will sprain her ankle and will be in the forest/mountain area. Maria will be in the library and there is a book on the table, you have to give it to her. Popuri can be found in the mountain area behind the carpenters house, press A near the tree to climb it. Karen can be found at the Vineyard prompting you to enter the wine cellar with her. Ann will have fallen at the area behind the carpenters, talk to her to complete the events.

, If you have completed the events and never missed her birthday, continue to give your lady her favorite gift until her heart turns pink. Once she has reached a pink heart visit the Tool shop, which Rick owns. It is in the upper left corner of the town. You will notice he has a new item. It will appear to be a blue feather. The cost will be 1000 G. Take note you will need to have upgraded your house and buy a kitchen before you can get married. The blue feather will only appear once you have completed this.

, You will receive the photograph from the wedding and when you awake the next morning, your wife will be present.

Start resetting your PokéRadar to try to make shiny patches appear.,
Start the fight.",How to Find Shiny Pokémon1," Encountering a Shiny Pokémon in the wild is a 1/8192 chance. Although this chance is 1/4096 in the newer games, that's really, really low. Chaining is the practice of encountering the same Pokémon repeatedly to increase the chances that a Shiny version will appear. Breaking the chain at any time will reset your chances, making it a slightly tedious experience.

You cannot chain in Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, White 2, HeartGold, or SoulSilver as there is no PokéRadar available. You can chain for Shinies in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, X, Y, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.;
, The PokéRadar becomes available after you have defeated the Elite Four. This tool will show you spots in the grass where you can encounter wild Pokémon, and is essential to creating a chain.

Register the PokéRadar to one of your buttons, and unregister any other items (bike, fishing rod, etc.). Using any other item while chaining, even by accident, will reset your chain.

, You receive the Shiny Charm after completing your Pokédex, so it may take a while. Equipping it will increase your chances of encountering a Shiny Pokémon.

The Shiny Charm is only available in Black 2 and White 2, X and Y, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, & Sun and Moon.

, These items keep random Pokémon from attacking you, and are critical to keeping your chain intact. You should ALWAYS be under the effects of a Super Repel while chaining. It is recommended that you have at least 200 for extended chaining sessions.

Make sure you have a good supply of Pokéballs to catch the Shiny Pokémon., Assemble a team of well-rounded Pokémon with lots of PP so that regardless of the type of shiny Pokémon you encounter, you will always have someone in your team to beat it. You can use the PP remaining to count your chain as well.

It will really help to have a Pokémon that knows False Swipes, so you can lower the HP of the Shiny Pokémon to 1 without knocking it out.
Having a Pokémon with Sleep or Paralyze will also make more difficult Pokémon easier to capture.

, Shiny Pokémon appear in the same locations as their regular versions. This means that you should go to a location where you can find normal versions of the Shiny Pokémon you want., To make chaining easier, you will want to find a patch of grass that is at least 5x5 tiles. This will give you enough room to walk around without breaking your chain, since leaving the patch at any time will break your chain.

Some guides recommend finding patches that are 9x9.

, This will give you the most room to move in any direction., Make sure to pay attention to HOW the grass shakes; there are three different ways that the grass can shake. Note the way that the patch you enter is shaking., This will start a battle. If the Pokémon is the type that you want to get as Shiny, KO it to start your chain. If it's not, finish the battle and then walk 50 steps to reset your PokéRadar and start again., After KOing the first Pokémon, move onto the next shaking patch to continue the chain. There are several very important aspects to keep in mind:

The next patch must be at least 4 tiles away from you (the numbers vary from guide to guide, but this number is a safe number that will keep your chain active).
The next patch must be shaking the same way that the previous patch was.
If the patch you pick is at the edge of the grass area, you will need to reset your PokéRadar after the fight. Do this by walking 50 steps without fighting and then using it again. Be sure to not leave the grassy area!

, Keep finding patches of grass to keep encountering the same Pokémon. Each time you defeat one, your chain will increase by 1. You can either make a tally on a piece of paper or use a Pokémon with a high PP attack to act as a counter. Increase your chain until you get to 40.

If your chain breaks for any reason, you'll have to start over.
Saving your game or quitting will break your chain.
Using the Roller Skates will break your chain.
Leaving the field will break your chain.
Fleeing a battle will break your chain.
Encountering any other Pokémon will break your chain.

, Once you've reached a 40 chain, your odds are as high as they are going to get. You can now start resetting your PokéRadar until a shiny patch of shaking grass appears. Shiny patches will start appearing in about 1 out of 50 resets. Reset your PokéRadar every 50 steps to cycle through patches as quickly as possible.Once you've gotten your chain to 40, it can still take a significant amount of time to make a shiny patch appear.

, Once you see the shiny patch, congratulations! You've summoned a Shiny Pokémon. All that's left to do is capture the Shiny Pokémon found inside. You can capture them just like you would a regular Pokémon. Make sure you don't knock it out!"

Obtain a Pokémon from another region.,
Equip the Shiny Charm.,
Put both Pokémon in the Day Care.,
Receive your egg.",How to Find Shiny Pokémon2," The key to breeding a Shiny Pokémon is to breed Pokémon from two different regions. For example, if you live in the US, obtain a Pokémon from Japan or Europe. Make sure to obtain the Pokémon that you want to get a Shiny version of.

This breeding method, also known as the Masuda method, is only available in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver, Black, White, Black 2, White 2, X, and Y.
The easiest way to get a Pokémon from another region is to trade with someone. There are several popular trading sites online that can make this a fairly simple process, such as PokéBay and Reddit's Pokémon Trading subreddit.
The two Pokémon must be able to breed normally with each other. This means they must be the same species or share an Egg Group, and are opposite genders. If the Pokémon you want to breed is genderless, then you will need to breed it with a Ditto.
You can tell what region the Pokémon is from by looking at its PokéDex entry. In the upper-right corner, there will be a three-letter abbreviation for the region the Pokémon is from (JPN, FRE, ITA, etc.). If there is nothing there, then the Pokémon is from your own region.

, You receive the Shiny Charm after completing your Pokédex. Equipping it will raise the chances that the egg that hatches contains a Shiny Pokémon.

The Shiny Charm is only available in Black 2, White 2, X, and Y.

, Depending on their compatibility, the chance of you receiving an egg from the pairing can be anywhere from 70% down to 20%. The game calculates the chance for an egg every 256 steps you take in the world.

You can increase the speed by riding your bike instead of walking.

, Once you get an egg, you'll need to hatch it. This can take a little while, and you won't know what's inside until it hatches. By breeding Pokémon from two different regions, your chances for a Shiny go from 1/8192 to 1/1024 (8x more likely)."

Understand how fishing streaks work.,
Gather your equipment.,
Prepare your party.,
Find a good location.,
Start fishing.,
Keep trying.",How to Find Shiny Pokémon3," Pokémon X and Y introduced the concept of ""fishing streaks"". This requires you to continuously hook wild Pokémon without pulling up nothing or messing up the reel timing. Increasing your streak will increase the chances of catching a Shiny., Make sure you have plenty of PokéBalls, as well as a fishing rod. You don't need special rods to perform streaks, but the rod you use will determine the level and type of Pokémon that you can catch., You will need Pokémon that can beat any Pokémon that you catch on the rod. You will also want a Pokémon with ""Suction Cups"" or ""Sticky Hold"" to be the first Pokémon in your party. This will increase the odds of hooking a wild Pokémon, which is essential for fishing streaks., You can increase your chances for hooking a Pokémon by fishing in an enclosed water tile. For example, if you're fishing from the back of a Pokémon, try to find a tile that is surrounded by the land, a rock, you, and an unfishable deep water tile., Once you've found a good spot, cast your line to start fishing. Press ""A"" as soon as you see the notice that you have a Pokémon on the line. Any of the following messages or actions will cause the streak to end:

""Nothing seems to be biting..."" - This is a random occurrence, but can be mitigated by fishing in an enclosed spot.
""No! You reeled in too fast!"" - You pressed the A button too soon.
""No! You reeled in too slow!"" - You pressed the A button too late.
Leaving the area.
Starting a battle outside of fishing.
Quitting the game.

, As long as you are successfully hooking Pokémon, your streak will increase. This will increase the odds of finding a Shiny, up to a certain point. Because it is random, there is still the chance that you will not find a Shiny, even after successfully catching numerous Pokémon with your rod."
"
Save right before picking your starting Pokémon or starting a Legendary battle.,
Pick the Pokémon or start the fight with the Legendary.,
Load your save and try again.",How to Find Shiny Pokémon4," There is a very small chance that the Pokémon you pick will be Shiny. Save right before picking or starting the battle., If the Pokémon is not Shiny, restart your game.

This will not work on Legendaries in Pokémon X or Y.

, This is a long and very time consuming process. Some people have reported it taking over 1000 tries. If you keep trying, however, you may be able to get a Shiny starter or Legendary.

If the Legendary fight is one where the Pokémon will automatically run, it will still be Shiny when you meet it later.

Pedal the bike with your hands and the Pokémon GO app will register movement, allowing an Egg in your possession to hatch as if you were walking., With duct tape, secure your phone very carefully to the blade of a standing fan or to the top of a ceiling fan. With the fan on, Pokémon GO will register movement and make it possible to hatch your Egg.

If you are using a standing fan, make sure that its base is secure and can handle the weight of the phone without falling over.
The farther from the center of the fan you tape the phone, the more quickly it will cover distance.

, With the record player turned on, your phone will spin around the perimeter and cover distance on the Pokémon app as if you were walking., As you may have gathered, you can hatch your Pokémon Eggs faster by putting your phone on essentially anything stable that makes detectable movements in the same direction. If you happen to have a flat-surfaced cleaning robot like a Roomba and you put your phone on top of it while it's in use, you've got an easy way to catalyze your Eggs' hatching - all while getting the dirt out of your carpet., Adjust the speed to a slower pace if necessary and simply let it run its course.

Note: we do not encourage nor suggest actively playing Pokémon GO while driving; just let the meter run to hatch your egg., Presumably yours, the dog should be medium to large sized. Let your dog do what he/she does best - wander. Be sure to keep your dog in sight to keep your phone from being stolen., Extend your egg incubation to the stars above., Doing this can cause the game's location function to glitch, making your trainer avatar ""walk"" erratically near your location without you ever moving around."

Acquire a Pokémon Egg.,
Check how long the Egg will take to hatch.,
Incubate the egg.,
Travel the distance specified on the egg.,
Incubate another Egg once one Egg hatches.",How to Hatch Pokémon Eggs6," To hatch a Pokémon Egg in Pokémon Go, you need to find one first. To find an Egg, walk to your nearest PokéStop and activate it by spinning the medal that appears in its center. A number of items will appear, and one may be an Egg. Tap on it to collect it; if the PokéStop you visit does not yield you an egg, head to another PokéStop that appears as blue and try again.

, Once you have an egg, you want to know how long it'll take you to hatch it once it's incubated. To do this:


Open your items by pressing the PokéBall on the bottom of the screen.
Tap the ""Pokémon"" button.
Tap ""Eggs"" in the top-right corner.
Find your Egg and tap on it. On the screen, the Egg will display as either 2km, 5km, or 10km. This tells how how far you need to travel in order to hatch the Egg (in kilometers).

, Once you have your Egg, you must incubate it to hatch it. You can do this either using the Incubator you receive at the beginning of the game, or by buying more in the PokéShop. To incubate your egg:


Navigate to your Eggs as described above.
Tap on the Egg you wish to hatch.
Select ""Incubate"" to begin the incubation process.

, If your egg is a 5km egg, you will need to travel 5km to hatch it. So, get walking, jogging, skateboarding, or cycling! After you have travelled this distance, you will see a screen that says ""Oh?"" and your Pokémon will hatch!You must travel the distance specified with the app open.
You cannot incubate your egg while traveling faster than 20mph.
Pay attention to your surroundings while traveling with the app open.
The longer the distance required, the rarer the Pokémon. , When the Egg you were incubating hatches, your Incubator will continue to ""deteriorate."" Make the most of your Incubator by putting another egg into it as soon as possible.


To hatch multiple eggs at once, you can purchase additional Incubators at the shop."

Have the right moves.,
Breed the two Rattata at the Daycare Center, and hatch their egg.,
Obtain a Focus Sash.,
Battle a sufficiently strong Pokémon with the level 1 Rattata as your lead.,
Choose Endeavor as your first move.,
Use Quick Attack to finish off the opponent.",How to Win Any Pokémon Battle With a Level 1 Rattata," Get a male and a female Rattata and have both of them learn Quick Attack (at level 4) and Endeavor (at level 44).;
, This will allow you to have Quick Attack and Endeavor on a Level 1 Pokémon.

, This can be gotten from Route 221 in DP/Pt, as well as by spending 48 BP at the Battle Tower in DP/Pt, the Battle Frontier in HGSS, the Battle Subway in BW/BW2, and the Battle Maison in XY and ORAS. You can also purchase it for 24 BP at the Pokémon World Tournament in BW2. Give this item to the level 1 Rattata to hold.

, If in the middle of a battle, switch in the Rattata in a way that it will not take any damage. This can be done by switching it in when another Pokémon faints, when your opponent uses a non-damaging move, or when a slower Pokémon use U-Turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass after the opponent's attack. Make sure there are no entry hazards on the field, and Hail or Sandstorm is not active.


Any damage the Rattata takes before it gets a turn, or that doesn't leave it at 1 HP, will break your Focus Sash and render your Rattata unable to win.

, Your opponent will hopefully hit your Rattata with a strong attack that would one-hit KO Rattata. The Focus Sash saves Rattata from getting one-shot, leaving it with 1 HP instead. Endeavor then makes your opponent's HP equal to Rattata's, putting it at 1 HP.


If your opponent did not attack your Rattata or leave it at 1 HP, and its Focus Sash is not broken, use Endeavor again.

, Since Quick Attack has priority, it will always move first regardless of speed, except against other priority moves. This will do the minimum of 1 damage, hopefully KOing the opposing Pokémon.

Know the basics.,
Know which starting players you should have.,
Pay lots of attention to the graphics in each of the Pokémon series games.,
Find out a little about each of the villains and their plans (as well as the cities and towns you'll go and find).,
Check out the legendaries on the version you want to play (and the typing of the starter you'd choose).",How to Pick Which Pokémon Game to Play," Generally, the newer the video game, the better it is - but there are a few exceptions. The central version is usually better than the dual games that came before it. Such as:


Pokémon Yellow
Pokémon Crystal
Pokémon Emerald
Pokémon Platinum;
, Your starters are always good ways to judge a video game. When you're looking at the starters, ask yourself - ""Do I like the appearance of this starter?"" ""What are the moves that this starter learns - and do I like them?"" etc.

, Graphics are a good portion of the qualities of Pokémon games. Despite this, a video games can still be a great game even if it has a small bit-count. Sonic The Hedgehog 2, to name one.

, You might even want to read up on the gym leaders (in Pokémon Sun and Moon, there are trial captains instead of gym leaders) and landscapes of the game you wish to play.

, For example, if you want to pick Torchic as your starter, you might be better off buying Sapphire instead of Ruby to avoid having 2 fire types in your team.

Read the instruction booklet.,
Chose your Pokémon wisely.,
Also, choose a way you will defeat your challengers, two ways are having one Pokémon that is the strongest/gets to fight all the strongest trainers,this is a good method because it will have that Pokémon get the most training and all the Exp.points - then use the others as back up.,
Another good method is simply train all your Pokémon equally, have them all roughly around the same level (1, 2 3 or 4 difference)however this could take long and waste a lot of time, you have to have patience and an excepting heart for constant failing Pokémon.

,
Use the grass training method.,Sometimes you have to just believe in your battling skills.have an idea of what moves their Pokémon might use and never give up

,
If you beat the Elite Four and you become champion, go battle the Elite Four again.",How to Win a Pokémon Game," It will always tell you what type all 8 of the gym leaders use. For instance, the manual in Pokémon Diamond tells you what type of Pokémon the gym leaders use.;
, Don't get a fire type Pokémon that will evolve into a fighting type if there are a water, ground, flying, and psychic gyms.

, However this method could backfire, if for example you have a strong fire type that like 10 or more levels higher then the rest and they are ""KO'd"" you will have to keep using revives and revival herbs that are super expensive or simply defeat Pokémon with levels and moves 20 times strongest and faster then your own....

,, Before a gym battle or Team Rocket, Magma, Aqua, or Team Galactic, go in a grass area. Battle the wild Pokémon until you level your Pokémon up.You can choose to battle Pokémon with slightly lower levels then you own but takes a while to level up or to a grass area with Pokémon tougher then your own, you get Exp. points quicker but you might get knocked out a lot and loose lots of money buying potions and healers.

,, It will raise your Exp. level, make sure your well prepared with lots of status healers and potions and even though you beat them once, it still can be hard again...

Know the HMs in Pokémon.,
Get the HM and the required Gym badge.,
Teach the HM to your Pokémon.,
Use your HM.",How to Use HMs in Pokémon," Depending on the Pokémon game you have, certain HMs may not be available. With the addition and removal of certain HMs in each game, keeping track of which HM you'll be able to use is important. Different generations have different HMs - sometimes varying between the games!The HMs introduced in Generation I are Cut, Fly, Surf, Strength, and Flash.
The HMs introduced in Generation II are Whirlpool and Waterfall.
The HMs introduced in Generation III are Rock Smash, and Dive exists in the Hoenn region. Whirlpool is no longer an HM.
The HMs introduced in Generation IV are Rock Climb, Defog in Sinnoh, and Whirlpool was reintroduced in Kanto and Johto. Flash was removed.
No HMs were introduced in Generation V (with the exception of Dive's reintroduction), but Defog, Rock Smash, Whirlpool, and Rock Climb were removed.
Generation VI re-added Rock Smash and Dive in the Hoenn region, while Dive was removed from the Kalos region.
The move Teleport, which has been in the game from Generation I onwards, is not considered an HM, but can be used outside of battle to teleport the player to the last Pokémon center or place of healing that they were at.;
, With the exception of Generation V, to use an HM you've received, you'll need to get a certain gym badge. Sometimes, these HMs will be given to you by the Gym leader after you've defeated them, meaning that you don't have to wait to use the HM after getting the Gym badge.

, Access your bag, go to the TMs and HMs tab, and search for the HM you want to teach your Pokémon. Keep in mind that your Pokémon's type is important when deciding to teach a Pokémon a HM - a fire-type Pokémon like Charizard can't learn a water-type HM like Surf, for example.

, Depending on the HM, the prompt to use it may automatically trigger under certain circumstances, or you may have to manually select it.


Any HM that changes something about the environment or allows you to travel on non-walkable surfaces (for example, Cut or Surf) can be triggered by walking up to the ""variable"" of the environment (for example, a small tree or a lake) and pressing A. This will prompt you to use the HM.
A HM like Defog, Fly, and Flash has to be prompted by accessing the menu, selecting the Pokémon that knows the HM, and selecting the HM.

Decide upon your team.,
Capture your team.,
Breed (or soft reset) for IVs/nature.,
Train for EVs.,
Get the moves you want.,
Level the Pokémon.,
Test your team.",How to Win WiFi (and Regular) Battles in Pokémon Games (Advanced)," Believe it or not, charging in madly with your favorite far fetched  is not going to win you a battle. All Pokémon have strengths and weaknesses, but some have overpowering strengths and some are mind-numbingly weak. Battle simulators, such as Pokémon Online, are also necessary for learning. Beware: It can take a lot of time to get the perfect team on Pokémon Online or any other simulator. Also, you may decide that simulators are just as fun as real battles (which in many ways they are) and that training Pokémon for battles is too much work. If that's your opinion, it's fine; however, if you still want to train Pokémon in the actual games, continue on.;
, If there is only one of your Pokémon in your game, like most legendaries, you'll probably have to soft reset for IVs. Otherwise, just capture them and worry about stats later. (If one of the Pokémon you want on your team is unobtainable (event Pokémon whose events you missed or Pokémon only available in games you don't have) you'll probably have to rethink your team or trade on the GTS for it. Sorry!) Optionally, you can also try to capture a shiny Pokémon of your species in order to give a daunting first impression. However, the effort required to capture a shiny is phenomenal and usually not worth it.

, IVs, or Individual Values, are numbers that each individual Pokémon has that affect its stats; likewise, natures boost one stat and lower another. Pokémon that lack IVs in certain stats will be easier to defeat than Pokémon with maximum IVs. Unfortunately, generations of IVs and natures are entirely random and require a good deal of breeding. Guides to breeding for IVs can be found everywhere, and is by far the easiest in 5th generation games.

, When you have a perfect hatchling with the nature and individual values you want, STOP! First of all, training it at the daycare for the first few levels will make this far easier. EVs are obtained when a certain Pokémon is defeated. (For example, defeating a Pidgey gives one Speed EV.) Four EVs in a stat raises the stat by one, and a stat's EVs max at 252, whereas a Pokémon's EVs max out at 510. Certain areas are very useful for training in certain stats, and can be found online. Battle simulators should give you a good idea of EV spreads to choose.

, This step, compared to the others, is much easier. Use the move relearner to learn moves you or the Day Care may have skipped over; move tutors and renewable generation 5 TMs are also very useful. Some moves are event only, and cannot be learned normally.

, In order to win battles against regular trainers, levels are necessary. High-levelled Pokémon can rematch the Elite Four over and over again; VS. Seekers and rematchable Pokémon Breeders are useful to train weaker ones.

, Regular Wifi Battles against friends or Random Battles all serve to to help you see any flaws in your team. If there are major, unfixable flaws, you may need to take drastic measures or train a new Pokémon.

",How to Use the Global Trade System on WiFi," If you do not have one in your home, they are available at the Local Library or at coffee shops. Some do charge a fee.
,,,,,, For example, if I have seen a Pikachu and need one I can search one out. The trainer will post what Pokémon he or she wants for it. Say they want a Corpish in return for that Pikachu. If the Corpish you have is the gender and level that the other trainer requested then you can trade it to get the Pikachu you wanted.

, If you want a Mightyena you could offer up a Gyarados so someone who wants a Gyarados will trade you the Mightyena.

In Black and White, you'll receive an elemental monkey in the Dreamyard which will make the fight for your first badge much easier. Try to catch a Purrloin on Route 2 as well.
In Black 2 and White 2, make sure to catch and train a few Pokémon on your way to Aspertia City. Try to find a Riolu in Floccesy Ranch to make the battle against Cheren a snap.;

Make sure that you are close enough for the IR signal to connect. If you can't get the connection working, try using the Union Room (see the next section). The Union Room is also better for trading with strangers in public places, as you don't need to synchronize the IR connection.

, One of the major upgrades to the trading process is complete access to all of your Pokémon. Select the Pokémon that you want to offer for trade and it will appear in the trade window. Once your partner has selected a Pokémon, it will appear in the other window. After you both accept the trade, the Pokémon will be traded.

Select your ""Poke Transfer ID"" option.,
Select the six Pokémon that you want to transfer.,
Use the crossbow on the bottom screen to attempt to catch the Pokémon.,
Confirm that you want to transfer the captured Pokémon.",How to Trade Pokémon on DS3," You normally cannot trade Pokémon between the two Generations of games. You can transfer small batches of Pokémon at a time from your Generation IV game to your Generation V game (but not vice versa). This is a one-way process, and the Pokémon will be erased from your Generation IV game after being transferred.You'll need two DS systems in order to make this transfer.

, Any items that are being held by Pokémon will be lost when they are transferred, so make sure you remove any items that you want to keep.

, In order to transfer your old Pokémon to your Generation V game, you'll need to have beaten the game first and collected all of the Gym Badges. This is to prevent you from getting an unfair advantage by importing a bunch of leveled-up Pokémon.

, You can find this facility in the same spot regardless of what Generation V game you're playing.


When you go to the Lab for the first time, you'll be taken through several conversations.

, You will then be instructed to continue the process on the second DS system

, This will be on the main menu of the second DS, before you start the game.

, It may take a few moments to download.

, You can select nearly any of your Pokémon from your PC in the Generation IV game. You cannot select any Pokémon that has learned a Hidden Move, but you can use the Move Deleter function to let the Pokémon forget it. You also can't transfer any Pokémon from your active Generation IV party, so move them to your PC first.

, Tap and drag the crossbow back to aim and set the power. Release it to send a Poke Ball flying into the top screen. If it hits a Pokémon, you'll capture it.


If a Pokémon is hiding behind a bush, hit the bush to make it start hopping.
You only have a certain amount of time to complete this, but you can do this as many times as you'd like.

, Once the game ends, you'll be asked to confirm the transfer. Remember, this is a one-way move, so make sure you want to proceed.

Fight all the trainers you see.,
Use the VS. Seeker.,
Fight Pokémon that give the most experience per kill.,
Get an EXP Share.,
Switch train.,
Save rare candies.,
Feed your Pokémon some Vitamins.",How to Train Pokémon," You might just want to get through to the next area of the game as fast as possible, and therefore try to ignore as many trainers as possible. This is counter-productive, as it would be wiser to train the skills now and go back to the Poke center than walk all the to the area just to get a few battles.;
, This lets you re-challenge enemies after walking a certain amount of steps. If you use this in tandem with normal training, you can maximize your efficiency, as defeating trainers almost always gives you more experience than fighting normal pokemon.

, For example, fighting audino gives you a thousand plus experience every time you fight it, so looking out for the shaking bushes in which it resides is always worth it.

, The method for getting these are different among games, but rather easy to acquire earlier in the game. This allows you to transfer some of the exp per battle to a Pokémon in your party, by having that Pokémon hold the exp share. Therefore, this allows you to train your lower leveled Pokémon without having to use them in battle

, Put the Pokémon you want to train as the first Pokémon in your party and get a wild encounter. On your first turn, switch out that Pokémon to your main pokemon, or another Pokémon you want to train with that is better suited. Finish of the pokemon, and both Pokémon used in battle should get the exp.

, Don't use them right away for the easy levels from 5-6 or similar levels. Wait for your Pokémon to be higher leveled, at least 70, where these candies will be most effective. If you use them early, the time saved now versus the potential time saved would be astronomically different.

, These won't actually raise levels, but they will raise the stats of the Pokémon you are trying to level up, meaning that you can kill enemies faster and therefore get more exp faster.

Make sure you're happy with it!",How to Train a Competitive Pokémon," Lets say you are going to battle in a certain tier. You'll want to pick a good Pokémon from that tier to battle. Choose one that you actually like. If you like Magikarp better than Arceus, use Magikarp! They can kill Arceus because it's the one you don't like.;
, Breed it until it has the nature you want, and the IVs you want. IVs raise your Pokémon's stats, and natures (usually) increase a stat and decrease a stat.

, EV train the Pokémon! EVs can increase stats, too, and help you in battle.

, Moves that you prefer and go well with the Pokémon's stats. For example, a non-boosted Hydro Pump does less than a non-boosted waterfall on Gyrados. On which you prefer: The lower moves (Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, Surf, etc.) have more accuracy and PP. The higher moves (Fire Blast, Thunder, Hydro Pump, etc.) have more power.

, If you're in a free level battle, it won't do ANY good to have your level 41 Gengar face a level 100 Gengar because it is a big advantage to the opponent

, All this means is that let's say this: Starmie. Starmie vs Starmie. Starmie usually know Thunderbolt, for type coverage.

, If you like defensive teams, don't use an offensive team.

Use Volt Tackle with your Pichu.",How to Teach Volt Tackle to Pichu in Pokémon," Volt Tackle is a special move for the Pikachu family, but it can only be obtained by breeding a Pichu. You can then evolve that Pichu into a Pikachu or Raichu.Volt Tackle is only available in Pokémon Emerald and later. It is not available in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Gold, Silver, Red, Blue, or Yellow.;
, You'll need this special item in order to breed a Pichu that knows Volt Tackle. It is a fairly rare item, and the process for getting one varies depending on which game you're playing:In Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver, X, and Y, you can find Light Balls held by wild Pikachus. There is a 5% chance that the wild Pikachu you encounter will be holding this ball. This means you will likely need to capture many Pikachus before you find one. You can also use skills like Thief and Covet to try to steal the Light Ball without capturing the Pikachu.
In Black, White, Black 2, and White 2, the Light Ball is only available from certain event Pikachus. If you need a Light Ball in these games, you'll either have to cheat for one or get one in a previous game and transfer it.
In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, you can find a Light Ball at the south end of Route 120, at the top of the large grass patch near the exit to Route 121.

, There are two main ways you can breed a Pichu: You can use a female Pikachu/Raichu and a male Pokémon from the Fairy or Ground egg groups (including another Pikachu/Raichu), or you can breed a male or female Pikachu/Raichu with a Ditto.The Fairy egg group includes Clefairy, Jigglypuff, Togetic, Marill, Roselia, Shroomish, and many others. See pokemondb.net/mechanics/egg-groups/fairy for a complete list.
The Ground/Field egg group includes Rattata, Ekans, Vulpix, Psyduck, Eevee, and many more. See pokemondb.net/mechanics/egg-groups/field for a full list.

, The Light Ball will need to be held by one of the two Pokémon you are breeding. It doesn't matter which of the two is holding it.

, While the two Pokémon are here, they will eventually create an Egg.

, The time it takes will vary because the process is slightly random. Every 256 steps, the game calculates whether or not an egg is laid based on the types of Pokémon you are breeding. You'll likely get an egg the fastest by breeding a Pikachu with a Pikachu.


The egg-laying process will go even quicker if one of the two Pikachus is from a different trainer (traded).
You won't be notified that an egg has been laid, so you'll need to check back periodically. The Day Care attendant will be in a slightly different location if an egg has been laid.

, Walk around with the egg in your party for a little while, and it will soon hatch into a Pichu. You can speed this up by riding around on your bike.

, Your new Pichu will have the Volt Tackle move available to it since you used the Light Ball during breeding. You can evolve this Pichu into a Pikachu and then a Raichu, and it will continue to have this move.


If you evolve Pichu into a Pikachu, and then breed that Pikachu, it won't pass on Volt Tackle. You must always use a Light Ball to give Volt Tackle to a new Pichu.

Nintendo emulators reproduce the functionality of Nintendo devices so you can play on your computer the games that are normally exclusive to DS platforms (or Game Boy).

Some Nintendo emulators that you can download are Visual Boy Advance from http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gba/vboyadvance.html, and Neon DS from http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/nds/neonds.html.;

, Double-click on its desktop icon or select it from the list of applications installed in your computer to launch it.

, While emulators function as the console, ROMs are files that contain the replicated data of a console game. Basically, ROMs are the virtual counterparts of gaming cartridges, and just like how a console needs a gaming cartridge to play a game, emulators need ROMs to work.

There several websites on the Internet where you can download ROM files for free. One site where you can get Pokémon ROMs is Cool Rom (http://coolrom.com).







, Since ROMs are created by individuals and not by the game publishers, some console games like Pokémon may not have its ROM counterpart (especially the newly released ones), so you may have to wait for a while before a ROM version becomes available.


Once you find the Pokémon game ROM you’re looking for, download the file from the website and save it in your PC.

Battle a lot!,
Evolve your Pokémon.,
Use special medicines.,
Try as hard as you can to beat the Elite 4!",How to Strengthen Your Pokémon," It can be annoying with those desperate trainers wanting to battle, but it IS a good idea to battle as much as you can. Also, don't always take the shortcut around the tall grass. If you do, you might miss out on finding a rare or even shiny Pokémon!;
, With most Pokémon, you evolve them by getting them up to a certain level. Some need a special stone to evolve (example: Clefairy + Moon Stone = Clefable). Don't do this as soon as you get the stone! Let them get really strong THEN evolve them. Some Pokémon evolve under specific conditions (example: Pichu+Happiness=Pikachu). Some Pokémon just DON'T evolve.

, Rare Candies are good. Don't use too many, though. Rare Candies are sort of like drugs for Pokémon. There are also jars of medicine you can buy that boost a particular stat. These jars can also raise the base HP or PP of a single Pokémon (or one of their moves).

, Remember to save the game after each battle. Also stock up on medicines! If you lose to one of the Elite 4, you lose some of your money and you have to go through the entire Elite 4 again!

, The nature should promote the Pokémon's role in your party. Every nature either doesn't affect anything or raises one stat by 10% and lower another by 10%. A sweeper specializing in special attacks can afford to have its attack stat lowered, while its speed or special attack is raised.

, IVs are random bonuses to a stat that range from 0 to 31 for each one. IVs are unique to every Pokémon, so no two have the same values. To check any stat but hit points, use the following formula:


(* 100 / Level) - 2 * Pokémon's base stat - int(EV / 4)
To check hit points, use this formula: (* 100 / Level) - 2 * Pokémon's base HP - int(EV / 4)

, However, don't just battle any Pokémon; to make a nearly perfect Pokémon, you must battle specific Pokémon that give you appropriate effort values, or EVs. When you get four EVs of the same kind, you gain an extra stat point. You can have a maximum of 510 EVs per Pokémon, but only 255 per stat.

, Battle any Pokémon that gives a lot of experience to reach level 100 quickly after you're done EV training. When you're finished, you should be able to crush almost every other Pokémon easily.

, Keep the Pokémon you want to raise always in the number one position and if you have Pokémon Heart Gold or Soul Silver, talk to them often and give them as much attention as you can.

Okay, so if you want to completely max your Pokémon's stats there are two main ways you can do it, you can either train in, which can be tiring, stressful, and can take ages, but you don't need any materials apart from your DS, your Pokémon game and a lot of spare time.
,
You can do that, or use an action replay.,
If you use the action replay version it is recommended you read the instructions and use the Internet for help.

,
If you prefer the manual version you can battle a number of trainers to earn money and xp.

,
One of the easiest ways to do this is to battle the rich trainers near the Pokémon mansion, they aren't real hard to beat, with Pokémon around level.,
You can also do a a couple of other things like giving your Pokémon exp shares and soothe bells to increase their happiness.,
You could also let the daycare raise your Pokémon, this way you don't have to worry about them, but this is only recommended for Pokémon up to level 35, because Pokémon at higher levels will take much longer to level up and cost a lot of money.

,If you try all of these methods you shouldn't have too much trouble maxing your Pokémon's stats.",How to Max out the Stats of a Pokémon,", The action replay device is used for cheating. You can easily do many different cheats with it in minimum time. You can do anything from increasing your Pokémon a level to getting unlimited items, but for this you need an action replay which can cost anywhere from #40-$75, a computer, and a bit of inner geek can help, if you want codes you can either search on the Internet. The other option is to download pokesav to make the codes, but this can be complicated.

,,, 30. But they give you a heap of money when you win, there is about 5 of them. if you use the Pokémon battle finder machine thing then you can re-battle them again and again. If you do this a couple of times you will soon notice your amount of money dramatically increasing. If you have enough money you can then go and buy some proteins, carbos and other medicine type upgrades, these are rather expensive so you might have to go back and keep on battling them.

, Another good technique is to battle the Elite Four, if you do, especially if you get to the end you will have gained a heap of levels and experience for your Pokémon, and if the game if Pokémon Platinum then whenever you re-battle the Elite Four the level of their Pokémon increase, making it even more challenging and raising your Pokémon's level even more.

Forget the timer.,

However, remember that the tagline is ""Catch 'em all!"" and not ""Defeat 'em all!"" This is the best way to avoid frustration in a Pokémon game, and you will go searching in each and every patch of grass.;
, This can be hard to do, especially because the timer pops up every time you save. Just learn to ignore the timer, forget for how long you have been playing, and...Hey, you didn't get bored!

Catch Pokémon.,
Level, evolve, and train your Pokémon.,
Breed Pokémon.,
Trade Pokémon with your friends.,
Buy items to help you win.,
Challenge gym leaders.,
Collect badges.,
Fight the Elite Four.,
Enjoy the whole game!",How to Play Pokémon1," In order to get through any of the games, you will need to catch Pokémon in order to build a team. You can catch Pokémon that you find in encounters out in the world. Weaken them through battles and then catch them with a Pokéball! Some Pokéballs work better than others.


Get in the tall grass. In all Pokémon games, if you travel into tall grass, random wild Pokémon jump out at you quite often. Often, the tall grass will contain common and low leveled Pokémon, which can be useful to train newly-caught Pokémon. Some tall grass however contain exotic Pokémon as well. Late in the game, you may even find a rare legendary Pokémon in the tall grass as well.;
, You will also need to make your Pokémon stronger, if you want to beat the game. Level up your Pokémon by giving them experience in battles (gain enough levels and they will evolve into something more powerful!) and consider EV training if you want to make them really strong.


Find out what moves are the best for your Pokémon type, and what moves it is weak to.
You might also want to learn new moves using Technical Machines or Hidden Machines, which are items you can find in the game that will teach compatible Pokémon new moves..







, Breeding Pokémon is a huge section on its own. It is usually used to teach a Pokémon moves it would not otherwise learn and manipulate its IVs to give it optimal stats. Breeding it with a specific Pokémon that has a certain move will sometimes result in the baby learning said move, even if it could not otherwise. Breeding should only be done after you have some experience playing Pokémon games.

, Many of the Pokémon games will let you trade Pokémon with your friends, by connecting your games together. Trading is important because you will only have access to certain Pokémon depending on what version of your game you bought and what you've been able to catch. Trade with people who have different versions of the game. This is the only legit way to catch 'em all!


For example, if you have Black and they have White, trade to get the Pokémon you won’t be able to find in your game.

, There are lots of items in the game that can help your Pokémon. There are items that make them level faster, items that heal them, items that make them happy, and items that make them easier to catch! Get money in the game and find items to help you win.


Always have extra money on you. You never know what might happen. Your Pokémon could get badly injured, and it's nice to see some cool new stuff! Spend some money if you want!

, Almost all Pokémon games revolve around a common theme: you will need to challenge and beat each of the gym leaders to progress through the game. If you want to beat them, you’ll need a strong team and well-trained Pokémon with type advantages against the gym leader. Each trainer will have a certain type of Pokémon that they focus on. Make sure you know what their focus is so that you come prepared.

, When you beat the gym leaders, you’ll collect the badge for that gym. There are eight gym leaders to beat and eight badges to collect. When you've got them all, you can progress to the final section of the game! Beating gym leaders also nets you a TM (Technical Machine) which may contain rare and strong moves!

, The Elite Four are the final bosses of the game. These are the best of the best Pokémon trainers and you will need to have powerful Pokémon, a balanced team, and great skills as a trainer to beat them! After you do, you will fight the champion.

, The beginning of the game may be boring, but pay close attention to what any of the characters have to say. It could be important toward your adventure! Usually the first few hours of the game aren't very action packed or loaded with addicting mysteries to solve. You have to put time and effort into progressing further into your Pokémon journey. This is what makes it fun!

Once you start to progress in the story, don't give up because you get stuck. Look around because there is always a way to beat your Pokémon game.
If you can't beat a gym, grind against wild Pokémon and buy potions.
Take a break. If you can't beat an area or level, just go and calm yourself by exploring new dungeons, having friendly battles with friends, etc. Because when you're frustrated because you spent three and a half hours on this one impossible level, the answer won't show itself. But when you look at the problem again, it will be more likely to reveal itself.

One of the easiest ways to get started is to buy RPG Maker XP, then download Pokémon Essentials, a free, fan-made creation that mimics a real Pokémon RPG. To find out more, read about RPG Maker XP and check out the tutorials on the Pokémon Essentials wiki., All you need to start your own Pokémon card game is paper and pens. Even if you're not willing to draw the cards, you can print out artwork from fan sites and other free online resources.

Search for online templates that look similar to the original Pokémon card game's base design. This way, when you print up your own cards, you can print your cards on the base design to make your card game look more official., A game styled off of Dungeons and Dragons will be more flexible than digital, tabletop, and card games. These games are based on storytelling, characters, and imagination.You can come up with elaborate rules systems if you like, or use an existing system to tell your own Pokémon story., Have you always wanted to invent your own Pokémon? What about playing as your favorite Pokémon instead of a trainer? Write down a few ideas that make your game unique.


Think about how you would use your ideas in an RPG, card game, or whichever format you chose. If it doesn't seem like a perfect match, maybe you could make a board game or video game.

, You'll have to think about the people who will play your game if you're going to design the best game possible for those kinds of people. Younger players might require very simple instructions with examples and pictures, older player might like rules and game play a little more complex. Some age ranges to consider include:


Ages 6+
Ages 6 - 12
Ages 10+
Ages 10 - 12
Ages 16+, and so on...

, A large, involved project might require more effort than you'll be able to muster on your own. You may need to recruit friends or help from online fan communities to help with trickier parts of your Pokémon game-making project. Smaller projects, like those that investigate certain aspects of the game, can be more reasonable for you to accomplish on your own. Some examples of smaller scale game projects might include ones that develop the story of a side-character or explore a region in the Pokémon universe more fully.


Become involved in online fan communities before begin working on your game. Make friends online so you can ask them for help with your game when you need it. Some examples of fansites you might look into include: the ultimate Pokémon network at www.upnetwork.net, Pokedream at www.pokedream.com, and Bulbagarden at www.bulbagarden.net.Recruit from among your friends at school who are also interested in Pokémon. You might even have a game, anime, or Pokémon club that you can join to make like-minded friends. If no such club exists, you might want to look into how to start a school club.
Take a pencil and paper and write down the particulars of your game. In particular, you should decide how long your game will be, the characters involved, the Pokémon available, and the physical size of the game. Before starting, you should decide how many squares your board game will be, you should know how many cards you'll need to make for your card game, and you'll also need to know the dimensions for the maps in your digital games., You'll need detailed and easy to understand rules for your game so that other players can understand penalties, rewards, and how to play your game. You should write down a list of rules and get the opinions of others to find out whether they are clear or not.


Keep ties in mind. While playing your game, two players may draw, or a player and a non-player character may draw. In this case, you should have clear instructions what players should do.
When you have finished writing your rules, go through each and make sure none of the rules contradict each other. Rules that disagree with each other may leave players confused as to what to do next.
You might want to write your rules in the Pokémon style to add realism to your game. For example, instead of writing a rule, ""Players should draw a card at the beginning of each turn,"" you could instead write, ""Trainers should power up their Pokemon by drawing cards at the beginning of each round.""
You should also include the conditions necessary for player to win with the rules of your game. These conditions can range from simple to complex, depending on the age range and difficulty of your game., When you don't have goals or deadlines, you can sometimes lose focus and spend too much time tweaking unnecessary features. To prevent yourself from lollygagging and not finishing your Pokémon game, you might want to come up with a development schedule.Identify the main tasks of your project, predict how long each task will take, write down the order you plan on working on and completing tasks, and then get to work!


An example development schedule might look something like:
Jan. 1 - 5: Write dialogue for characters
Jan. 6 - 20: Write code for maps one and two
Jan. 21 - 31: Write code for character dialogue
Feb. 1 - 10: Test code
Feb. 11 - 20: Promote on social media
Feb. 21: Release game

, This model will serve as the rough draft for your game. Depending on your approach to planning, your model might be a simple 2-dimensional sketch of your game setting/board on a piece of paper, but you might benefit from making a more detailed 3-dimensional model. You could even use both of these approaches, starting with a 2D sketch and then further developing that into a 3D model.


You'll need to know how you plan on placing the squares of your board game, if you plan on making one. You can even plan on future artwork or setting drawing you plan on using in the future, simply make a notation or draw a simple sketch.
Your card game may or may not use a placement board where players lay cards onto specific spaces for certain purposes. But if your game does, you should create a model of one of these placement boards. The physical model will help you test your game.Draw maps. Tabletop RPGs sometimes make use of pre-made maps for dungeons or other scenarios, like battles. Digital RPGs also use maps that small digital character models (called sprites) travel across. You should draw all maps necessary for your game.

, This includes creating things like game pieces, playing cards, character dialogue, code, tokens, and various other things depending on the kind of game you decide on making. This is often the longest part of the game making process and will require hard work and dedication for you to complete.


You may have to revise your deadline schedule at some point during the development of your game's materials. This is not always a bad thing, as some parts of the game making process will likely be easier than you expect.
For physical games, you might check out how to make molds. This way, when it's time to make a character model for the game pieces on your board, you can create a realistic mold for pieces., Once you've made the game board and completed making the supplemental odds and ends, you'll need to test your game. You should think about how you can best run a focus group. You want to get the honest feedback of potential players so you can improve things like game play, appearance, dialogue, and fun-factor.You may notice during the course of testing that some of your supplemental materials, some tokens and models for example, are too small for players to use easily. You may want to note this fact down, as well as a note to increase the size of those objects.
If you have difficulty taking feedback, you can always use an impartial third party to run your game testing. This way, you won't influence the test group with your opinions or accidentally add supplemental information players wouldn't normally have., This might involve getting the help of a professional artist, recruiting volunteers from fan communities to help make the game, or, for large scale projects, producing your game at a factory. Or you may only want to make a single game for you to play with your friends. Whatever the case, your finished product should be the best version of your game. Proofread your game text, check illustrations - double check everything.


To save money, you might use volunteers to finish the models and professionals to put together the final product. This way you get a professional finished product without having to pay for a professional for the entire project., Fans that helped you make your game might want to take part in enjoying the finished product. In this case, you might post a link to the game on the homepage of the fansite you used to find your helpers. Or you might just be proud of your hard work, in which case you could announce your game's debut on social media, like Twitter and Facebook.


For fans on a budget you might look into ways you can advertise for free. There are also techniques you might employ to advertise for free with local venues on the Internet., Adding a second phase to the testing of your game will often reward you with an even better finished product. For example, at first you might use a small, select group to improve your game. Once that group has contributed all they have to offer, you can move on to the second round of tests, often called beta tests, and see what new players think about the game. Make changes according to the suggestions of the players until your game is ready to release.More complicated games might require more rounds of testing. You should test your game as many times as is necessary until you feel comfortable with the condition and clarity of the game., Fan communities are often tight knit, and through these you can sometimes inquire with users who have experience making games. You can ask specific questions, or you might be more general in your approach. Remember to be respectful when asking another fan to invest time answering your questions or consulting on your game project.

, Though a relatively new and rare service, 3D printing is slowly becoming more widely available.With a 3D printer, you can use a computer to generate a 3D model of your game, game pieces, and other game materials. For more information on 3D printing, you should read up on how to print a 3D object.


3D printers are still relatively expensive, making them fairly rare. You might find a 3D printer you can use to make your game at your local university, a design firm, or a model building company.

, With enough time and effort on your part, eventually you'll likely make a game that you'll be proud to admit is your own creation. However, by crowdfunding your game, you can increase the money you have to invest in your game. Depending on your fundraising efforts, this may mean you can afford hiring professional development of your game."

,, Roll two dices, add the values and multiplying it by 10., Every trainer starts with 5 Pokeballs (they’re used for catching Pokémon)., Every trainer starts with 10 Trainer TXP (Total eXperience Points). TXP shows how strong the trainer is. More is the TXP, it means more trainer battles the trainer has fought., Each trainer also starts with 10 Trainer AXP (Available eXperience Points). They are used for buying special abilities for the trainer.


NOTE: AXP CAN be spent, but TXP CAN’T be spent. Once earned, you can’t spend or decrease your TXP. However, you can increase it by winning more trainer battles.

NOTE: Trainer TXP and AXP can only be earned by winning trainer battles and not just any battle, for example, a wild battle.

, Choose on of the starters available in the generation you decided to play. If not all trainers get a starter Pokémon, the GM can give them a substitute starter Pokémon of that generation., In fact, whenever you catch a Pokémon, be sure to create a Pokémon Sheet for it. Write the following informations:

,,,, For stats of any wild Pokémon, look at the section “Catching a Wild Pokémon”. You have to distribute 20 points between the 4 stats for your starter Pokémon. According to the Stats, the ‘Level’ of the Pokémon is decided.

For example, if all Stats range from 1-6, then the Pokémon is ‘Level 1’.

7-12 = Level 2        
13-18 = Level 3        
19-24 = Level 4        
25-30 = Level 5        
31-35 = Level 6



, The Pokémon TXP and AXP is 10 in the beginning. It’s much like Trainer TXP and AXP, however your Pokémon can earn TXP and AXP by winning any kind of battle, be it a Gym Battle, or just a Wild Battle., The formulae for HP is (Attack + Defence) x 5. The HP can't exceed 350., Your Pokémon can buy moves with its Pokémon AXP. This will help it in becoming stronger., If the number rolled is even then you’ll encounter a wild Pokémon. If you encounter a Pokémon, the GM will decide which Pokémon you’ll encounter. Also, the GM will fight for the Pokémon., The Level of the wild Pokémon will the same as the Level of your first sent Pokémon., Roll the dice 4 times and according to it note the corresponding Stats. The Stats will range according to the Level. If the wild Pokémon is Level 1, the Stats will range from 1-6. Do the same for the remaining Main Stats. For HP, apply the same formulae, Attack + Defence x 5., The Pokémon with higher Speed will move first. An exception is the move Quick Attack, the Pokémon using that move will always attack first, regardless of their Speed., Roll the dice 2 times and multiply their sum by your Attack or Special depending on the move. This is the power with which you’ll hit., Do the same as the attack. But instead of multiplying by your Attack multiply by your Speed to determine whether the move hits you or not. If your Speed is more than the Power, you successfully dodge the move. If the move hits you, do the same and multiply the sum by your Defence. Now subtract the Defence by the Power to calculate the Damage., Continue this system by attacking turn by turn until a Pokémon loses, i.e. its HP reduces to ‘0’ or less than ‘0’. Or, throw a Pokeball to catch it., To determine whether you’re affected or not, let both the players roll a dice, if the attacking player rolls more, then the defending player is affected, if the defending player rolls more, then he isn’t affected. Once affected, keep the particular Special Condition for a few turns, around 3-5 turns. If the player uses an item to remove that Special Condition remove it. Here is what to do in particular condition:         

Poison: Subtract 5 HP each time the affected Pokémon attacks.        
Burn: Subtract 5 HP each turn.        
Paralyze: Both the players roll a dice each time you attack, if the affected Pokémon rolls more, the move will work normally, if not, it won’t be able to attack.        
Frozen: Same as Paralyze.        
Confused: Same as Paralyze, but if the affected Pokémon doesn’t rolls more, it’ll end up doing itself damage of 15 HP.        
Asleep: Both the players roll a dice each turn, if the affected Pokémon rolls more, it’ll wake up. If not, he’ll keep sleeping.

, After a defeating a wild Pokémon, each Pokémon which participated will earn 10 Pokémon TXP and AXP., Reducing its HP will make it easier for you to capture it., Try to use higher form of Pokeballs for capturing difficult or stronger Pokémon., The defending Pokémon will roll the dice = HP / 10 times., The player with the higher value wins. If the wild Pokémon wins, it’ll run away and a Pokeball will get wasted. If the player who threw the Pokeball wins, Congratulations! He recently caught a Pokémon!, Its Stats will be the same with which it was fighting. The Pokémon which you used to capture the wild, will also earn 5 Pokémon AXP and TXP., You can even battle with trainers of your group to master the technique of battling, learn different strategies of playing, earn money or help you and your Pokémon earn experience. The GM can even take the role of NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to battle with the players and help them become strong. NPC Trainers generally are found on routes. The GM will also take the role of Gym Leaders., Generally, Trainers use 4-5 and Gym Leaders use 2-3., If the Gym Challenger wins, he’ll receive the corresponding badge., And, each Pokémon which participated in the battle will also gain 5-35 Pokémon TXP and AXP. This GM will decide how much the TXP and AXP the Pokémon will gain.

If the Pokémon lost, without defeating any Pokémon, it’ll earn only 5 TXP and AXP.
If it defeated 1 or more than 1 and fainted, it’ll gain 20 TXP and AXP.
If it did not faint until the end of the battle and defeated 1 or more Pokémon it’ll gain a massive 35 TXP and AXP!
If it was alive and didn’t defeat any Pokémon, it’ll not earn any TXP or AXP.
The GM will also reward the winning trainer with $30.

, Battle all the wild Pokémon that you may encounter in between., All the stories and quests are created and run by the GM while the players participate in it and try to find the solution. It’s the GM’s choice whether he’ll develop a story for a city or not. But stories are highly recommended to make the game interesting and full of adventures., Get the official Gym Badge to participate in the Pokémon League at the end of your journey. As this is a trainer’s first priority., A GM can conduct Local tournaments, which are conducted in a city’s gym and all the trainers in that city can participate. The GM can develop his own rules for the tournament (which should be fair), can follow already made rules in the Pokémon Anime Series, and has to play the roles of NPC Trainers.

In a Domestic tournament all the players playing the game (under a particular GM) can participate. There are no NPCs. The GM has to develop rules in such a way that each player should have battled all the players at least once. Conduct a Domestic tournament only if the game has more than 6 players.

, You can increase any of the four Main Stats by 1 each day for an AXP cost of 1-6. Higher is the Level of Pokémon more is the cost of increasing a Main Stats by 1. The AXP cost for increasing Main Stats is equal to the Level of the Pokémon. You can also increase up to 5 HP per day. The amount of AXP you pay, that much HP will increase. For example, if you pay 3 AXP to increase your HP, your HP will increase by 3., The AXP cost of the move is the Level at which it learns the move. For this type of information, search Bulbapedia.

For accuracy reducing moves, reduce the Attack and Special Attack.
Also while using any move which reduces Main Stats by one stage, reduce the Stats by 2.
For any move that reduces sharply, reduce by 4. With every stronger move the GM can increase its damage. For example, as a Pokémon learns stronger move, it’ll do +20 damage. Whatever the damage be, 20 will be added to it. If the damage is 30, in this case it’ll do 30 + 20 = 50 damage. The damage increased will be the Power in the games / 2.

, A Basic Pokémon will need at least 300 TXP to evolve into Stage 1. And, a Stage 1 Pokémon will need at least 600 TXP to evolve into its max evolution. Remember TXP can’t be spent. So you don’t have to reduce your TXP after evolving., For example, Pikachu needs Thunderstone to evolve into Raichu., Remember, in some cases the GM may not allow. If the GM thinks that the Pokémon is not eligible or the trainer isn’t experienced enough to handle a powerful Pokémon, he can reject the request.         

A Basic Pokémon's Main Stats can only go till 15, Stage 1’s can go till 25 and Stage 2’s can go till 35. So to increase your Stats after your limit, you have to evolve your Pokémon.

, What is basically happening? Why and How is it happening? Creating a plot first will help you go into sub-plots later. Be as much creative as you can., How the trainers will solve the problem? Try to create multiple solutions., They have to make different choices given by you during the story or quest. Narrate it in this manner:         

Prologue: How everything was before the problem arrived…        
Introduction: Introduce the players to the problem.        
Body: Let the players find the problem.        
Solution: Give the players hints on how to solve the problem and let them solve it. Let their actions make way for different endings.        
Epilogue: How is everything after solving the problem? Basically, this is the end of the story.

, When you have enough money to buy a particular item, go the PokeMart and buy it. PokeMarts are available in almost every city. Tell the GM before you buy any item.

The price of the items depends on the GM. He can set it as much as he wants. But it should be reasonable. All the items in the Pokémon games are available with their corresponding effects.

, The different types of balls with their Catch Rates are written below:         

Pokeball: CR = 3, Price = $30
Great Ball: CR = 6, Price = $60
Ultra Ball: CR = 10, Price = $100
Master Ball: Captures the Pokémon instantly, Price = $1000 (you can buy only 2 Master Balls in your whole journey)

Write out a list of all the Pokémon you like or would want on a team.,
On your list of Pokémon, put an F next to all Pokémon that can learn 'Fly' and an S next to all those who can learn 'Surf'.,
Get one Pokémon in each type category.,
Get it down further.,
Wait until you've gotten six.,
Get all the new little Pokémon onto your new game.,
Sit back and relax with your amazing team of Pokémon.

",How to Make an Amazing Pokémon Team on Any Game," It can be a list of anything, but you should write down all the types you would like (all types if you're unsure) and categorize each Pokémon you find under the types. If you wanted fire, water, grass, psychic, dark, ghost and dragon on your team, but no bug or poison, that's where you would start. Water, Fire, Grass, Electric, and Flying are the most important types to get in your journey make sure you get them. Also, try looking at websites like Smogon.com, or at a picture of all the Pokémon to help you remember all of them. Write down the highest evolution, marriland.com, Pokémon.com, and serribi.net or .com - what you're going to end up with, and next to it write the lowest evolution - the one you're going to be stuck with for a while. And also make sure your Pokémon are at level 15 when you got to your first gym them 20-25 third 30- 35 if you can and so on. If you can tolerate both of those Pokémon, keep them on the list.;
, You're going to need these Pokémon while playing the game, and you should have one of each for your new team.

, The best way to do this is to go on websites like Smogon.com and see which would be right for you.


Look at their stats, what their greatest weaknesses are, and what moveset is best for that Pokémon. For example, if you have Poliwrath, Vaporeon, and Kabutops under 'Water', you would search each one individually on Smogon to see which is the best. In this example, say you actually wanted Poliwrath more but Kabutops looks like the stronger Pokémon, you would have to find the deciding factor - the moveset, perhaps, or maybe Kabuto takes too long to evolve. Perhaps Vaporeon doesn't have the best range of moves. These are all things to consider. Hopefully you'll be able to chip the categories down to one Pokémon.







, Now you'll want to move off of that paper and start on a fresh one. Write all the remaining Pokémon on that paper. It's a good time to reconsider your choices. Try to visualize using that Pokémon. Research the moves it can learn, what levels it evolves on (or how it evolves), its maximum stats, its secondary typing in comparison to the other choices. If you can't get eggs for these Pokémon or get them in the game, how will they be obtained? Think of every aspect while crossing out the potential teammates. You should still reference Smogon while making these choices.

, You can either start the game and start catching, or do it the way most people do it: Pokémon breeding. This, of course, warrants the use of an already used game, which you will hopefully have.


With the desired moveset in mind, research each of the six Pokémon on Serebii.net (make sure it's the right game you're looking under). Pay close attention to each of the egg moves the Pokémon has, and see if it's a possibility to give to your new baby Pokémon. For example, if you chose Houndoom and you want it to know Nasty Plot right away, you would want to fin two compatible Pokémon (all on Serebii.net) that would give the egg Houndour Nasty Plot (a move it does not learn until past level 60).






The father Pokémon gives the moves, the mother Pokémon gives the species, so to get a Nasty Plot Houndour, you could breed a boy Shiftry with Nasty Plot with a girl Houndoom. Once you have the eggs for all the Pokémon, get a Pokémon with Flame Body (Slugma, for example) or Magma Armor in your party and get hatchin'. If you have any TMs, use them (if we were to continue the Houndour example, perhaps Dark Pulse is a move you would want, a TM that is easily bought in the Celadon Department store). Pay attention to the EVs your Pokémon need to learn, perhaps give them some EV-upping items.







, It's a wise idea to level up the Pokémon just a little; level one Pokémon are rather puny. If you did not hatch the new Pokémon on the same game, be cautious about getting them over a certain level because without the proper gym badges they will stop listening to you (get your Pokémon to beat the first gym leader before they're level 10, for example). Train good and train hard - do what's necessary to earn moves and evolve.

Start with a ""set-up"" Pokémon.,
Choose a Pokémon with high Defenses with moves like Whirlwind or Roar so you can see what Pokémon your opponent has in his/her arsenal.,
Pick a strong dual-type Pokémon to start your fight.,
Have your Pokémon know attack-moves that take advantage of it's higher stat, either Attack or Special Attack.,
Some Pokémon have higher Defenses than Attacks.,
Balance out your team.,
Think about what held items you want your Pokémon to have.,
Pay attention to your Pokémon's Natures.,
Improvise, adapt, overcome.",How to Make a Pokémon Team," This Pokémon should know moves that lower your opponents' stats, cause status ailments, boost your team's stats, change the weather to your advantage, etc. For example, you could have a Forretress with Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock, Gyro Ball, and Payback. A good set-up Pokémon can help on both Offensive and Stall teams.;
, This Pokémon doesn't need to be strong when it comes to Attack or Speed and is more of a support Pokémon than a fighter. A good example is Skarmory, who heal instantly with Roost and support your team with Spikes.

, Powerful sweepers like Dragon Dance Gyarados can bring down entire teams if played correctly. Stall is common, so a good mixed sweeper like Infernape or Salamence can benefit your team.

, Snorlax has much higher Attack than Special Attack, so use physical moves. Lapras, on the other hand, has equal base Attack and Special Attack, so it can utilize Physical and Special moves accordingly.

, All your Pokémon don't necessarily have to be designated fighters; a few supporting Pokémon wouldn't hurt. Blissey can help your team absorb Special Attacks and heal with Wish, Softboiled or Aromatherapy. Hippowdon can be a huge help on a Stall team since its ability Sand Stream summons a Sandstorm, which can wear down Pokémon.

, Having all Steel types is all good and well until your opponent sends out an Blaziken. In Double Battles, a good duo can go a long way. The combined efforts of Skarmory and Blissey is famous for its ability to take physical and special attacks.

, Focus Sashes, Berries, and Leftovers are a good place to start if you want to focus on boosting your Pokémon's stats. However, the Flame Orb-Facade combination can work in your favor, as well as the Toxic Orb-Switcheroo combo.

, Certain Natures lower certain stats. The Adamant Nature boosts Attack, but lowers Special Attack, for example.

, If you find that a Pokémon isn't working well with the rest of your team, by all means, get a different one instead!

Normal attacks as normal, no matter who you fight.
Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel will burn in Fire’s blazing light.
Water drowns out Fire, Rock and even solid Ground.
Those who fly and those who swim, weak to Electric’s sound.
Flying pecks at Grass and Bug, and brings Fighting to yield,
While Grass, Psychic and Dark are quite sure to be Bug’s field!
Grass soaks up the Water type and breaks up Ground and Rock.
Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug are weak to Rock’s hard knock.
Ice freezes the earth and air, and snaps shut Dragon’s fangs,
While Dragon takes on Dragon, with a fiery, loud bang.
Fighting takes out Normal, Ice, smashes Rock, Dark and Steel.
Poison comes and causes Fairy, Grass and Bugs to keel.
The Ghost will spook the Psychic, sometimes even himself.
Steel brings Fairy, Ice and Rock to go up on the shelf.
Ground shakes up Electric, Rock, Poison Fire and Steel.
Psychic shall cause Fighting and Poison to always kneel.
Dark will scare the Psychic and bring terror to Ghost’s grin.
Against Fighting, Dragon, and Dark, Fairy’s sure to win.
You’ve memorized weaknesses for all Pokémon types.
So now you can do battle without having to gripe!

,


Fire cannot burn water, ground or rock, which is why it is weak to those types.
It is weak to other Fire-type Pokémon and dragons (remember, dragons breathe fire, so they are more immune!)

,


Electricity seeks out water and grass absorbs water, which is why water is weak to those types.
Water is ineffective to dragon types.

,


Electric types are weak against themselves (like many types, but not all).
They are weak to Grass types as well. This seems hard to believe, but picture a plant that is very hardy. Nothing bothers it, and a little bit of voltage certainly won't harm this mighty plant.
Finally, Electric types are weak to dragon types.

,


What are some things that plants can't defend themselves against? They are burnt by fire, die in poison and are eaten by bugs. Just remember a plant's natural enemies and you're over halfway there.
It is weak to Flying, Bug and Dragon because Flying, Bug and some dragons types have the entire domain of the sky, but plants must stay firmly rooted in place.
Grass types are bad at fighting each other. To remember this, picture two trees attempting to force the other out. However, they have similar bark and cannot tell whether they are fighting themselves or the other tree, and end up just wrapping around each other, hindering themselves in the process.

,


Ice is melted easily by fire, and although water isn't as hot as fire, it's warmer than ice and will melt it too. Think of how in the summer, ice cubes melt in your drink and make it taste weaker.
Ice may be hard, but it's easily broken. Remember the beginning of Frozen, where the men are chopping away at the ice? Ice is no match for steel tools.
Ice is ineffective against other ice types because it can't really do anything. It can't freeze the ice, because it's already frozen, and it can't melt the ice either.

,


Picture fighting types as big weenies- really strong, but easily frightened. This is why they are weak to ghost types- they get scared!
Fighting types are really fit, so their blood circulates faster. This is helpful for fighting, but if they are poisoned, the poison will disperse through their body really quickly. So they have to pull their punches around Poison types- otherwise they might get stung!
If another Pokémon is too small to hit or too fast, then they won't receive much damage. This is why Fighting types are ineffective against Flying and Bug types- these types are too light, small or fast to be hit easily.
In a battle of brains versus brawn, who wins? Brawn could beat up brains, sure, but in the end brains will come up with a clever strategy to win. This is why Fighting types are weak against Psychic types- they are easily outsmarted because they rely on their brute strength.

,


Poison is ineffective against Ground and Rock, because Poison cannot penetrate rocks and the hard ground.
Did you know that snakes are resistant to the venom of other snakes? This is why Poison types are ineffective against other Poison types- they have to be, otherwise their own venom would injure them.
Poison works by seeping into a Pokemon's body. But if the Pokémon has no physical body, how can the poison work? This is why Poison types are ineffective against Ghost types- there's nothing to poison.

,


Grass types are firmly rooted in the ground, so things like earthquakes can't do as much damage as they would to other Pokemon.
Bug types spend a lot of time on the ground, so they're used to it. This is why Ground types aren't as effective to them.
Grass

,


Flying is weak to things that cause injuries to flying creatures. Lightnings (Electric), a blizzard (Ice) or a rockslide (Rock) can all hit really bad a bird for example, which is why Flying is weak to those three types.

, Psychic is weak to things that you would be afraid of (Bugs, Dark, and Ghosts). This is one of the easier to remember weaknesses in the games.

, Bug is weak to things that you can kill bugs with in real life (Birds, Fire, and Rocks).

, Rock is weak to the things that break it up in real life too (Water, Grass, Fighting, Ground, and Steel).

, Ghosts use tricks which are not known by the most living creatures. However, evil forces (Dark) and ghosts themselves know these tricks. This is why Ghost is weak to Dark and itself.

, Dragons are so powerful that they are weak only to themselves and the natural forces (represented by Fairy). The latter is to show that even the most powerful creatures are dependent on nature. Dragons are usually seen as reptiles and most reptiles cannot deal with cold (Ice), which is why Dragon is weak to Ice.

, Steel is weak to fire and physical force (fighting), which molds it to begin with. It is also weak to Ground, which contains the metal when it is raw.

, Dark is weak to fighting because dark represents underhanded, dirty tricks while Fighting represents noble, disciplined technique. Essentially good vs. evil. This is the same reason why it’s weak against Fairy. Dark is also weak to Bug type because bugs generally thrive in the darkness.

, Fairies represent natural forces. However, Steel is an unnatural creation of humans which is why it is weak to it. Fairy is also weak to Poison because toxins can pollute the nature.

, There are types of Pokémon which are completely ineffective against other types of Pokémon. There are only a few and they are fairly easy to understand (Normal and Ghost just can't fight each other, Ground simply can't reach Flying, etc.), but you should still be sure to keep them in mind. You don't want to get surprised when your attack doesn't work!

, In the games, when a Pokémon uses an attack that is the same as at least one of it’s types, then it will get a 50% boost to the attack’s power. For example, a Steel Pokémon like Aron using an attack like Metal Claw.You should consider taking advantage of this bonus when you can, since it can make a big difference in your battles.

, Weather can also affect your Pokémon's effectiveness in a battle. For example, Intense Sunlight will boost your Fire-type Pokémon, while hurting your Water-Type Pokémon's attack power.

, Certain abilities can also help or hurt your Pokémon in battle, according to their type. Levitate, for example, will weaken Ground-type attacks. Get abilities that will help your Pokémon and watch out for other Pokémon using their abilities against you. If your Pokémon type is weak to their ability, get it out of there!

, There are held items which can boost an attack's power, but each Pokémon type also has an item which can increase the power of their attacks when held or used. For example, the Black Belt can increase the effectiveness of Fighting types."

Just being with you makes them happy."" So don't think giving Pokémon a bunch of poffins in Pokémon-Amie is going to make your Pokémon love you. You have to have them get to know you well. Use lots of Max and Super Repels, so you don't get driven crazy the next time you see a horde of Gulpin or that one annoying Whismur you can't seem to shake off.;
, The Herboriste shop in Lumiose City is know to sell herbs that restore HP/revive Pokémon, but lower their happiness level. Nobody likes to take bitter medicine! That's something we can all learn from toddlers and preschoolers everywhere!

, This item's ""echoed chime"" makes the Pokémon more friendly towards you. But if your Pokémon is already holding an important item (type-resistance berry, Mega Stone, etc.), this step is optional.

, This can be obtained by having any Pokémon (Works well if it is ""pumped up"") punch the normal black punching bag repeatedly. It should say something along the lines of ""Whoa! Your managed to find a Soothe Bag!""

To start off, you'll need a team of six to have the best advantage when battling.,
To put your team through a test run, see if you can defeat the Gym Leaders, Elite Four, and the Champion with your trusty squad.,
If you do need to change something about your team, you don't always have to replace the Pokémon.,
However, if you do choose to replace a move, make sure you perform a dummy run to make sure it's effective enough against the trainer you had trouble with.,
Once you've tackled the above challenges, it's time to take your game online or against a friend.,
When training up your team, consider using Power Items like the Macho Belt, and don't be scared about using the Exp.",How to Make a Perfect Team on Pokémon," Selecting your Pokémon can be tricky, especially since you have a lot to choose from, but the best rule of thumb to use is to select one of each main type (Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Flying and Dragon/Psychic/Steel etc.) This will make sure you have a Pokémon to counter almost any team, and it'll make it hard for your rival to pick a weak spot as you'll have most major bases covered.;
, If you can successfully defeat all of these trainers without any problems, your team is fully prepared for what's to come if you want to battle online or against a friend. However, if you have some difficulty, head back to the drawing board and make any necessary changes to your line up.

, Try replacing a move with another, or making that Pokémon hold an item to boost a stat. Don't be afraid to use the weather to your advantage as well, e.g. Blizzard or Sandstorm, as Pokémon who aren't an Ice or Ground Type will get heavily damaged by those moves above.

, For example, if you struggled with Gardenia, and used a Water Type Pokémon beforehand, by adding an Ice or Flying Type move, you'll be able to easily defeat her as Grass is weak to Ice and Flying.

, This way, you can really iron out any kinks in your team and prepare yourself for the Battle Frontier (if you have Pokémon Emerald, Platinum or HeartGold/SoulSilver). The Battle Frontier is filled with tough battles that will challenge even the most die-hard Pokémon trainers and their teams, so, as the saying goes... practice makes perfect!

, Share to level up lower-levelled Pokémon. However, don't just use Rare Candy, as even though your Pokémon level up, they won't grow as strong as a Pokémon who's been trained up properly, with help from a good friendship between the trainer and itself and with these steps you can make a good team

Know lots about Pokémon.,
Decide on a starter Pokémon.,
Decide on your other Pokémon.,
Look the part.,
Get some makeshift equipment.,
Go on your Pokémon adventure.,
Progress on your 'journey'.,
Find other trainers.,
Have fun with Pokémon.",How to Have a Pokémon Adventure," Play the games, collect figures and cards, read magazines, and learn about Pokémon. Learn all the names and moves. It may take some time to get used to, but it's definitely worth it. If you have a Pokémon game, try to complete it and beat the champion. Gather a good team of Pokémon, which will help later. It is recommended that you have a team of 3-6 Pokémon, with balanced types and moves. With less Pokémon, you can train them more. With more Pokémon, you can have more favourites/types. It's up to you. Get to know as much as you can.;
, It doesn't have to be the normal fire/grass/water types from the games; you could have a favourite. If you do want a starter from the games, here's a list of them:


Generation one: Squirtle, Charmander, Bulbasaur, Pikachu (Pokémon Yellow)
Generation two: Totodile, Cyndaquil, Chikorita
Generation three: Mudkip, Torchic, Treeko
Generation four: Piplup, Chimchar, Turtwig
Generation five: Oshawott, Tepig, Snivy
Generation six: Froakie, Fennekin, Chespin
Generation seven: Popplio, Litten, Rowlet

, The in-game team will help, try to stick to those Pokémon with minor changes to help you remember. If you want to try a different team, that's OK. You could use a trainer card creator to make a trainer card with your sprite, Pokémon, and pretend wi-fi code on it. It will help if you forget your Pokémon. Make a note of their moves. Try to stick to real moves that the specified Pokémon can actually learn.

, You don't need to, but it's more fun. Most trainers wear sporty, outdoor clothing. If you want to, carry and sporty bag/purse or backpack with you. For other clothing and accessories, you can wear baseball caps, beanies, scarves (mostly girls), jeans, trainers, sweaters, and hoodies. Try to get these items in white and red and trimmed in black. Sometimes you can find trainer costumes made for Halloween or fancy dress. Using these outfits might be fun.

, Use spray bottles with coloured water inside for medicine. Make sure to label them. For HM/TM's use old, unused, blank CD disks. You can spray-paint them and label them if you want to. You can buy or make Pokeballs. Most of them are pretty easy to make if you can't buy them, but you may need to look them up on Google images for designs. For the actual Pokémon, you can use figures or pure imagination. Try to find look-alike items for other objects. You're all set!

, Wake up early so you have a lot of time to start. Get washed and dressed and groom yourself as you normally do (brushing hair, applying makeup, etc.) before you set out on your adventure. You can go anywhere, from your backyard, to the park, or even the mountains or somewhere on holiday if you feel adventurous. Pick up your starter Pokémon, and put it in it's Pokeball, or let it walk with you if it's like Ash's Pikachu, who doesn't like it's Pokeball. Walk around a while, battling 'trainers' and wild Pokémon. If you want, you can hide Pokémon figures and 'catch' them in Pokeballs, after weakening them of course!

, Pretend to battle gym leaders and earn badges. Carry on and beat the elite four, and maybe the champion with your Pokémon. Just because it's pretend doesn't mean you can't have fun with it.

, Battle them by calling out moves and instructions. Win to get stronger. If you want, you can trade figures and items. You could even play the games together and have Wi-Fi battles. You might even find a new friend.

, Create new concepts. Have new adventures. Pokémon never gets old. You can play it with friends, you can play it on your own. Watch some movies with friends, or make some Pokémon food, like cakes and cookies. Battle with Wi-Fi. Become a Pokémon Master. Go to Pokémon clubs (they might have one at a local hobby store). You may make it to finals and win. The possibilities are endless. Just remember, You gotta catch 'em all, Pokémon!

Realize how long this will take.,
Teach your Pokémon effective moves!,
Battle!,
If you don't have the Vs Seeker go to Vermillion and talk to the person at the counter at the Pokémon Center, and she will give it to you.",How to Get Your Pokémon to Level 1001," It will take longer or shorter depending on how high your Pokémon's level is at. A Lv5 Squirtle will take much longer to train than a Lv80 Blastoise. The Blastoise might take about 5:00 to 7:00 hours of playing time to get it to the ""golden level"". As for the Squirtle, it will take about 48:00.

, This is important, because choosing the moves will determine how effectively your Pokémon battles. A Pokémon may either be taught moves with TMs (technical machines), HMs ( Hidden Machines), or it will learn a move on its own.

, This is the most obvious technique. Battling against other Pokémon boosts exp. The stronger the Pokémon you beat, the more exp. your Pokémon gains. If your Pokémon is at level 80 or above, the Elite Four is a great place to train. Deposit all Pokémon except the one you wish to train and battle the Elite Four. You will probably lose (don't use items) but you will make back the money you lost and your Pokémon will train very fast.

, The Vs Seeker will let you battle trainers you have already battled, which is a great way to level up your Pokémon and become richer.

As you probably know, you can't choose what moves your Pokémon learns in the daycare. However, there is a way to manage that to a limited level. Assuming your Pokémon only learns a couple more moves you can change which moves will be deleted first. At the Pokémon menu, you can view the list of moves it has. You can switch the placement of these moves, by pushing the button that says ""SWITCH"" and placing the moves you want deleted first at the higher rows.
Bulbapedia makes a good choice to find out at what level your Pokémon learns new moves.

Catch a Nincada.,
Keep an open space in your party.,
Have a spare Poké Ball (some versions only).,
Raise Nincada to at least Level 20.,
Allow Nincada to Evolve to receive Shedinja.",How to Get Shedinja," Shedinja appears when a Nincada evolves into Ninjask as long as you meet the right conditions. You can find Shedinja in the following locations depending on which version you are playing.Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald - You can find Nincada in the Grass in Route 116.

FireRed and LeafGreen - You'll need to trade for Nincada.

Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum - You can find Nincada in the Eterna Forest, but you'll need to the Poké Radar.

HeartGold and SoulSilver - You can get a Nincada in the Bug Catching Contest at the National Park on Thursday and Saturday.

Black, White, B2, W2 - You will need to trade for Nincada.

X and Y - You can find Nincada in the Grass in Route 6. You can also find it in a Ground-type Friend Safari.

Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire - You can find Nincada in the Grass in Route 116.;
, In order to receive a Shedinja when Nincada evolves, you'll need an open spot in your party. This means you can only have five or less Pokémon with you, including Nincada.

, Certain versions of the game require you to have at least one spare Poké Ball in your inventory. It must be a standard Poké Ball, not a special one like an Ultra Ball.


Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum do not require an extra Poké Ball. All other versions do.
Note that since Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum do not have a Poké Ball requirement, Shedinja will copy the Poké Ball that was used to catch Nincada. This is the only way to get a Shedinja in a non-standard Poké Ball.

, This is the first level that Nincada will attempt to evolve into Ninjask. Make sure that you meet both the space and Poké Ball requirements before allowing Nincada to evolve, or you won't get Shedinja. You can raise Nincada's level by battling or by using Rare Candies.Preventing your Nincada from evolving will allow you to continue to train both your Nincada and Shedinja at the same time, since the Shedinja inherits everything from the Nincada when it evolves. You can prevent an evolution by holding B during the evolution. For example, preventing your Nincada from evolving until it hits Level 50 will create a Level 50 Shedinja as well, with all the moves the Nincada has learned up to then.

, As long as you meet the requirements, Shedinja will appear in your party. You won't receive a notification that you've received it.


Since Shedinja comes from Nincada, if your Nincada is Shiny your Shedinja will be as well. Shedinja also inherits all of the Nincada's EVs and IVs.
Shedinja has 1 HP, but is not vulnerable to much. Shedinja's Wonder Guard ability only lets ""Super Effective"" moves hit. These include moves like Fire, Flying, Ghost, and Dark. It also packs quite a punch. If you teach Shedinja Quick Claw, you can strike first and take you foes out before they use a super-effective move."

Have a Pokémon with the ""Compound Eyes"" ability, one with Frisk, and one with either False Swipe (to make catching it easier) or Thief (so you can just steal it afterward).,
Go to Route 209.,
Use the Poke Radar until you find a Chansey.,
Repeat as many times as needed until you have the amount of Lucky Eggs you desire.

",How to Get Multiple Lucky Eggs in Pokémon Games1," CompoundEyes' effect outside of battle makes wild Pokémon more likely to be holding items if the Pokémon is on top, even if it has fainted. However, make sure they are both at least Level 21 (in Platinum, 19 if you're playing Diamond/Pearl), because you will need it to make sure the Repels will prevent your Poke Radar from breaking streak.


If you're playing Diamond, it can be a little difficult to get a Frisker, because one of the Pokémon that gets Frisk (Stantler) can't be found in Diamond, while the other (Banette) can only be found at night. If you're playing Pearl or Platinum, though, you can get Stantler on Route 207 by using the Poke Radar. But if you can get a Banette, that's even better, since Chansey's Normal-type moves can't hit it.;
, Use a Repel (preferably Max), have the Poke Radar on Select, put the Pokémon with Compound Eyes on top (again, the effect works even if the Compound Eyes Pokémon is knocked out, in which case you can put the Frisker right behind it), and save your game.

, Afterwards, bring out the Pokémon with Frisk, and if it has Lucky Egg, either catch it or use Thief. If it doesn't, knock it out and repeat. Remember to take the Lucky Egg off after using Thief.


Beware other wild Pokémon other than Chansey that could break your streak, though.

Level up your Pokemon.",How to Get Infinite Rare Candy in Pokémon Light Platinum," Using your emulator of choice, load up the Pokémon Light Platinum ROM to start the game.


Since Pokémon Light Platinum is a ROM hack of Pokémon Ruby, you should have no problems using your old Pokémon Ruby cheat codes for it.;
, Once the game is loaded, open up your emulator’s menu and look for “Cheats,” if you’re using emulators for the iOS or Android platforms. In case you’re using the latest version of VBA (Visual Boy Advance) on PC, then you’ll find the Cheats option under “Tools.”


This is where you’ll add the codes that will allow you to play around with the game’s RNG, or Random Number Generator.

, The first code that you’ll need to enable so that you can get Infinite Rare Candies is this Gameshark code for Infinite Items: D261DC6D 197B4DC2.When this code is enabled, you will get 99 pieces/units of whatever item is in the first slot of your PC’s Item Storage. Additionally, the item will always stay on the first slot even if you’ve withdrew all of it to you bag. Essentially, you’ll have an infinite number of whatever item is on the first slot.

, You’re then going to have to add this Codebreaker Item Modifier code for the Rare Candy: 82025BD0 0044.


Since this is a Codebreaker code, it’s best that you add this to your cheat list separately from the Infinite Item code.
It is not advisable to use this code by itself since it might cause your game to crash.

, Starting up the game will lead you directly to the character creation screen. Just input your name after choosing your gender, and watch the short cutscene that introduces the premise of the game’s story.

, After the cutscene ends, your character will now be in his/her room, and you can now control his/her movements. Move toward the clock or door to trigger a conversation with the character’s mother wherein she will ask you to set the time. Just set it to any time you want using your virtual D-pad or keyboard (or actual D-pad, if you’re playing using a controller).

, Setting the time will now allow you to regain control of your character again. Now, you’ll need to go down the stairs and out of the house to trigger another cutscene that will introduce you to Professor Jasmine and two other Pokémon trainers who’ll play an important role in the story later., After the cutscene/dialogue, a member of Team Steam will attack you and Professor Jasmine. Since this will be your first battle, the Professor will ask you to choose between three starter Pokemon: Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander. Just go for Charmander since you’ll mainly be up against bug-type Pokémon at the start of the game.

, You’ll only be up against one Pokémon during this battle, and all you have to do is spam Charmander’s Scratch attack. The enemy’s Pokémon (Poochyena) should be down after about two or three attacks from you.

, As soon as you beat the Team Steam grunt, the Professor will then bring you to her laboratory and give you a Pokeball. Finish up your dialogue with her and then head out of her laboratory.

, Once you’re out of the laboratory, go up north of the town and look for an area that has tall grass. Moving inside this area will result in you encountering wild Pokemon.

, The majority of the Pokémon in this area are low-level bug-types, thus making it ideal for leveling up Charmander. Just have Charmander fight 3 or 4 wild Pokémon to increase his level to 7, which will then allow him to learn the Ember move.


Due to its high damage output, Charmander’s Scratch should make short work of any Wild Pokémon you come across at this point. If you do come across a Pokémon with a high level, you can always Run Away.

, The moment Charmander’s level goes up to 7, you can now proceed further up north to Central City. Before you get to the city though, you will have to face three trainers who mostly have around 4–5 bug-type Pokemon.

, Don’t worry if the trainers have more Pokémon than you. Charmander should be able to take each Pokémon that he’s matched up against with one Ember attack. There’s no need to plan for a strategy for these guys since you will always get to attack first during every turn., After beating the trainers, immediately go to Central City and look for the Pokémon Center.

, Once inside, make sure to head first to the Nurse to have Charmander healed before heading to a PC.

, The PC is usually found on the Nurse’s station or on the eastern area inside the Pokémon Center. If you’re playing on an emulator for mobile devices, press on the A button on your screen (or its equivalent for those playing on keyboards or controllers), and it should now give you the option to open someone’s PC or your character’s PC.

, Open up your character’s PC and go to “Withdraw Item” under “Item Storage.” You should now see that the PC has Potions and Rare Candy stored inside of it. Withdraw all the Potions (there are 99 in total) to your bag by pressing on A (or equivalent button/key for those playing with controllers/keyboards) again. Doing this will result in the Rare Candy now occupying the first slot of your PC’s Item Storage.

, Now that it is on the first slot, you can get a maximum of 99 Rare Candies for every withdrawal. For those playing on emulators of touch screen devices, just press on A (or equivalent button/key for those playing with controllers/keyboards) when the Rare Candy is highlighted, and select the number you’d like to withdraw to your bag.

, You can log off of the PC as soon as you’re satisfied with the amount of Rare Candies that you’ve withdrawn.

, Use the Rare Candy by pressing on Start and going to the Items section of your Bag. Highlight the Rare Candy and press on A. On the options that pop-up, choose “Use” (press on A again) and highlight Charmander (or the Pokémon you want to level up).

Great Balls have a catch rate of 1.5x, while Ultra Balls have a catch rate of 2x.
The Master Ball has a catch rate of 255x, which will capture any Pokémon without fail.

Level Balls vary:

1× if the player's Pokémon is the same level as or a lower level than the wild Pokémon
2× if the player's Pokémon is at a higher level than the wild Pokémon but less than double it
4× if the player's Pokémon is more than double but less than four times the level of the wild Pokémon
8× if the player's Pokémon is of a level four times or more than that of the wild Pokémon



Lure Balls will work 3x better if used on a Pokémon hooked by a fishing rod.

Moon Balls have a 4x multiplier when used on a Pokémon belonging to the Nidoran, Jigglypuff, Clefairy or Skitty families.
A Love Ball is 8x better if the wild Pokémon is the same species as, but opposite gender of the Pokémon currently in battle.

Nest Balls are weird. Their catch rate is (40 - Pokémon's level ÷ 10)×.

Net Balls work 3x better if used on a Water- or Bug-type Pokémon.

Dusk Balls have a catch rate of 3.5x when used at night or in a cave.

, Every Pokémon game has version-exclusive Pokémon, meaning that some Pokémon can only be obtained in one version of the game. However, they still appear in the Pokedex.

First of all, you need to decide which Pokémon to level up that high.,
There are certain Pokémon who level up faster than others.,

, For example, Pokémon like Bellossom don't take as much Exp. to level up as Pokémon like Magikarp. In general, rare Pokémon and Pokémon who are weak and evolve into very strong Pokémon take longer to level up. In general Grass/Bug Pokémon and Pokémon who's stats don't have a giant gap between evolutions, like Zubat/Golbat/Crobat, take less Exp. points.

, It also sells for 4900P. However, selling the Exp. Share is possibly the biggest mistake you can make in any game (next to using the Master Ball on a Magikarp etc.), unless you have 100 or something. The Exp Share is really the point of getting a Pokémon to lv. 100. Using the Exp. Share to get the Pokémon to Level 100 is just part of it. It is also used to help those ""oh, they were really powerful when I used them, but now I caught new Pokémon when they were at, like, lv. 20, and I can't slow my team down to raise them"" Pokémon get to higher levels.

, Battle the Elite Four and trainers around (not ""in"") the Battle Tower/Frontier. These trainers usually have Pokémon at at least level 46 (Sidney in Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald, his Mighteyena is the weakest Elite Four and Battle Tower/Frontier will be.) Once your team can beat these guys just as easily as beating a bunch of lv. 5 Caterpie, then focus on raising one Pokémon to level 100 instead of all of them.

, The four Regis are bad choices for this, three of them are at lv. 40 when you catch them, and Regigigas, lv. 70, is pure normal and dragged down by it's ability, Slow Start, which is self-explanatory. However, the legendary birds Moltres and Articuno can help big-time, depending on how you raise them (Zapdos's only useful Electric attack is Thunder, which has terrible accuracy unless you waste a turn using Rain Dance). The Post-Game boss Legendaries (Heatran, Mewtwo, etc.) and/or the third version superpowers (Giratina for D&P and Rayquaza for Ruby and Sapphire) and the Duo version superpowers (Groudon and Kyogre for Emerald and Dialga and Palkia for Platinum) are usually strong and start off at a high level. Also the Cheat Legendaries Darkrai and Shaymin are useful, but they start out at a low level. Arceus, will definitely be of help.

, A level 100 Magikarp is useless if all it knows is Splash. Also, even Arceus can be non useful. If you teach it Hyper Beam, Focus Blast, Psychic, and Recover, your opponent could have a level 1 Spiritomb and guess what? You can't even damage it. Teaching balanced moves is key. Don't teach a Pokémon Earthquake and Toxic, because many Pokémon who have Levitate or are Flying are either Poison of Steel. Don't teach a Pokémon Fire Blast, Ice Beam, Shadow Ball, and Imprison for the fear of a Snorlax with Thick Fat. Check every Pokémon in the world and see if your moves aren't going to do anything against it. For example, there is no Pokémon who can easily survive the four moves: Ice Beam, Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Surf. Finding a Pokémon who can know those moves isn't hard, ex. Snorlax, Rhyperior, Dragonite, and Gyarados.

Know which Pokémon Vibrava is strong against.,
Know which Pokémon types to avoid.,
Bring lots of potions.,

Bring items that dispel status conditions.,
Use Vibrava in Pokémon battles to level it up.,
Use Rare Candies to instantly increase Vibrava’s level.",How to Evolve Vibrava," Vibrava is a combination of ground and dragon types, which are strong against poison (Ekans, Gulpin), rock (Graveler, Onix), and fire types (Charmander, Darumaka). Vibrava will inflict twice the normal damage when it attacks any of these types of Pokémon during battle, allowing you to earn XP points faster.;
, Ground and dragon types are seriously weak against ice (Cubchoo, Beartic), fairy (Spritzee, Floette), and dragon types (Dratini, Dragonair). If Vibrava receives any attack from these kinds of Pokémon, it will take twice the normal damage (in the case of ice attacks, it will take four times the normal damage).


Fighting lower level of these types can still beat Vibrava. If you encounter any of these Pokémon, call Vibrava back to the Poké Ball or flee from the battle to save time and life points.

, In battle, it’s possible that Vibrava’s HP will get low. Once Vibrava’s HP gets low, open your Bag (by pressing the Start button) and use a potion on it to restore its health.


Bringing lots of potions with you will greatly save time by reducing trips to Pokémon Centers

, You might encounter some Pokémon with skills with effects that last even after the battle. Skills like “Poison Sting” will continue to damage Vibrava long after you’ve won the fight.

Bring items like “Antidote” to remove status conditions on your Pokémon without having to go to a Pokémon Center.
Poison damage outside of battle only applies for the third and fourth generation Pokémon games. Starting in Pokémon Black and White, Pokémon no longer take damage outside of battle from poison.

, It is best to use Vibrava when up against poison-, rock-, and fire-type Pokémon for a quick and easy win, since Vibrava is strong against these types.


Vibrava evolves to Flygon only when it reaches level 45, so winning Pokémon battles easy and fast will greatly help speed up leveling.

, You can always level up your Pokémon the easy way using Rare Candies. These items raise any Pokémon’s level by 1 instantly once used.


Though it may save a lot of time, each game version only have a limited number of Rare Candies available, so will be impossible to raise Vibrava up to level 45 using only Rare Candies.

You can raise Sliggoo's level by fighting in battles or using Rare Candies.Sliggoo is a Dragon-type Pokémon, and is strong against Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric. This makes it great against a lot of the starter and wild Pokémon, but can lead to tough fights against other Dragon-types.
If you can raise Sliggoo to Level 49, gain enough experience to almost hit Level 50, and then stop. This will allow you to quickly level it when it rains, which Sliggoo requires to evolve.;
, Sliggoo can only evolve when it is raining out. Rain is random, but you'll have better luck finding it in the following areas:


X and Y - Routes 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 19, 21, Shalour, Kiloude, and Couriway. Rain can take a long time to show up, or it could appear immediately. Stay patient and you'll find yourself in a downpour eventually. Keep Sliggoo in your party but take care of other things. You'll probably happen across some rain when you least expect it.Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby - It is always raining on Route 120 in the tall grass, making it the perfect place to evolve Sliggoo.
Rain created by Rain Dance or Drizzle will not cause the evolution. It must be natural rain., You can either fight a battle that gives Sliggoo enough experience to level up, or you can give it a Rare Candy to have it level up immediately. Either way, it must be at least Level 50 before it can evolve.

Route 224 - Surf off of the southern beach along the middle of the route and head south. Follow the rocks down and you'll come across a small patch of land. You'll be able to find the Razor Claw here.

, There are two different ways to get your hands on Razor Claws in these games:


Battle Maison - The Battle Maison is similar to the Battle Tower or Battle Subway form previous games. It can be found in Kiloude City after beating the game. You'll need to earn 48 BP in order to get the Razor Claw.
PokeMileage Club - You'll need to play the Balloon Popping game (Level 3). The Razor Claw is one of the prizes available for winning Level 3.

, The newest Pokémon games still have a couple of Razor Claws for you to find:


Battle Resort - The Battle Resort becomes available after you have beaten the game and completed the Delta Episode. You'll receive an S.S. ticket, which allows you to take the S.S. Tidal to the Battle Resort. There is a Battle Maison that allows you to get a Razor Claw for 48 BP.
Mirage Forest - The Razor Claw can also be found in one of the Mirage Forests. these can appear daily, though there may be a Mirage Island, Cave, or Mountain instead. You will need to Soar with Latias or Latios to reach it. The only Mirage Forest which contains a Razor Claw is the one that appears north of Route 111.

Keep going.,
Upon his defeat.",How to Get Into Hardmode on Terraria," If you've destroyed the Eater of Worlds and have a lot of Shadow Scales, then make yourself some Shadow Armor. It might take a few times killing EoW (Eater of Worlds) to get enough Demonite or Shadow Scales. Once you have enough for a full set, go ahead and make each armor piece. This is typically the best pre-Hardmode armor in the game.
, Once you have the armor and preferably a ranged weapon (such as Sharanga, which is made from two Molten Fury's, which are made from a considerable number of Hellstone Bars), you need to go down to the underworld. It's easy--just dig straight down until you get there., When you get down (hopefully you brought a lot of solid blocks), build an arena--nothing special, just a giant bridge from one side of the world to the other. Kill a voodoo demon, and it will drop a voodoo doll. Once finished with the arena, look at the voodoo doll's direction. The Wall of Flesh (the final pre-Hardmode boss) will spawn close to the end of the world that the doll is facing. Go all the way to that side, then move back maybe thirty blocks., If you think you are ready, then either throw the doll into lava or just tap it, depending on which update you own. One of those methods will work., The Wall of Flesh will then spawn fairly close to you, so attack it with your ranged weapon a few times and then run backward. It spawns from its mouth dozens of minions called 'The Hungry' and once a certain number of them are killed, they become less abundant and are replaced with leeches., It's a good idea to stay fairly far from him, distant by at least 20 blocks. He has three main body parts: two eyes, and a mouth between the eyes. Just shoot him and shoot him and try not to burn in lava. Hitting the body parts deals damage not just to that part, but the whole Wall., Eventually he will die, and it will create a box that contains a Breaker Blade, a Pwnhammer, and a certain emblem. There you go! You are now in Hardmode."

Kalos Route 12 — Look behind the ranch house and you’ll see a bush. Use any grass-type Pokémon that has the “Cut” skill and cut that bush to get a Sachet.
Cyllage City — Head to the southern part of the city where you’ll see a house. Go inside the house and make your way to the kitchen where you’ll see a man. Talk to that man and he’ll give you a Sachet.
Battle Maison — Get at least 32 Battle Points and trade it for a Sachet.;
, Open your bag, select the Sachet, and choose Spritzee from the list of Pokémon you can give it to.

, Spritzee will only evolve to Aromatisse once it gets traded with another player using the game’s trading system. Trading systems and its locations vary depending on the game you’re playing.


For newer generations (fourth to X and Y), trading Pokémon are done using the GTS, or Global Trade Stations. To trade using the GTS, go inside a Pokémon Center in any town and talk to the receptionist (non-playable character) in charge of the system.

, Ask one of your friends to trade Pokémon with you. Select Spritzee from the list and trade it with any Pokémon the other player has or is willing to exchange. Once the other player receives Spritzee, its evolution will start and will change to Aromatisse.

, Ask the other player to start another trade so you can have Aromatisse back.


You can choose to skip this step if you prefer not to get your evolved Aromatisse back.

One example is in Ocarina of Time, where you’ll automatically acquire the Bomb Bag as you play through Dodongo's Cavern.
A Bomb Bag is free and can hold a maximum of 30 bombs. As you progress through the game, you'll be able to get upgrades that allow you to hold more bombs.;

, If you don’t have the money to buy bombs, you can still get some for free. Try slashing your way through grassy areas or opening every chest you come across both on the outside world (Overworld) and in dungeons. You’ll usually find bombs hiding in these places.

, Press the “Start” button on the controller of whatever Nintendo console you’re using to open its menu.


Using the Arrow keys, select the bomb from the list of items you have and press the Action button you want to assign it to, like the X or Y (Wii), or A or B (Game Boy).
Press the Start button again to go back to the gameplay.

, To use a bomb, simply press the Action button you assigned it to and Link will take out the bomb, holding it on top of his head.

, To drop the bomb, simply press the same Action button you used to take it out and Link will put the bomb down right to where he’s standing.


Once you drop the bomb, you only have a few seconds before it blows, so you better get far away from it right away.

, If you want to throw the bomb farther away, just run towards the direction you want to throw it using the Arrow/Directional buttons. While Link is running, press the Action button, and he will throw the bomb away towards the direction he’s going.

, If you’ve accidentally placed the bomb on the wrong place, you can pick it up again by approaching the bomb, pressing the A button of your controller to pick it up, and then repeating Steps 2 and 3 (or 4) above to drop or throw it again.


You can only pick up a bomb if it hasn’t exploded yet. But if you do pick it up again, remember that the bomb can explode while you’re holding it.

It is located northwest from the starting point at the bottom middle of the map. From the starting point, move one map tile up, then take two map tiles to the left. Once you’re there, take another two map tiles upward to find the entrance to the Fourth Dungeon.;

, Enter the secret staircase, and it will lead you to an underground room where you can see the Stepladder. Approach the Stepladder to retrieve it, and leave the room through the same staircase you used to get inside.

, Roam around inside the Fourth Dungeon, or outside on the Overworld, and look for one-square wide gaps that are blocking the path, such as rivers or trenches.


The Stepladder can only cover one-square wide gaps. It will not work on large breaches.

, Just like the Raft, the Stepladder is one of the few items that don’t need to be equipped before it can be used. Move close to the edge, and as you step over the gap, the Stepladder will automatically appear, letting you cross over.

, As you step to the other side of the gap, the Stepladder will disappear, and you can continue on your journey without stopping.

,
Take alternate routes with cannons, grind rails, zip-lines, and other mechanisms to skip large portions of the 2D sections with little to no risk.

",How to Play Sonic Unleashed for Xbox 3604," Remember to not be as reckless when going through these sections; do not use the speed boost unless Sonic is running in a harmless path.

,,"
"
There are many tricks and techniques that aren't mentioned in the game or is difficult to pull off.,
Aerial boosting is simply pressing a set of buttons that appear on-screen when Sonic files into the air and everything becomes slow; successfully pressing these buttons within a short time allows Sonic to go over gaps and reach out of reach places.

,
Parkour tricks such as running on walls and wall-jumping (in 3D areas) can be utilized by speed boosting on walls and pressing the button that appears on-screen when Sonic attempts to wall-jump on certain walls.

,
Sky diving is simply diving really fast while in the air after Sonic is free falling to an area below; pressing the X button will increase your speed while titling the control stick controls your position which can help avoid obstacles and reach the ground faster.

,
Drifting is turning around sharp corners without losing speed; this is difficult to maneuver as Sonic's natural speed interferes with his handling - simply tilt the control stick left and right (slightly) to make drifting easier to do.

",How to Play Sonic Unleashed for Xbox 3605," One should master them to beat the levels more easily and have a better time, which includes the aerial boost, parkour, sky diving, and drifting.

Gold/Silver - Route 1 and 29.
Crystal - Same as GS, but with Route 43 added.
Fire Red/Leaf Green - Canyon Entrance, Five Isle Meadow and Water Path.
Diamond/Pearl/Platinum - Route 202 with the Poké Radar.

Black/White - Route 7 (Swarm).
X/Y - Route 6.;
, If you traded for it, it will be where the Pokémon it replaced used to be. If you caught it in the wild, it will be closest to your current box when you open the PC as possible (if you had Box 3 opened and it was full, Sentret would be in Box 4 in the space nearest to the start of the box). However, if you caught it while there were spots in your party, Sentret will already be there.

, However, don't go as high as Level 100 (at Level 100, Sentret can't evolve). Use tools in your game such as the Exp. Share and the Daycare to do this, if necessary.

, You can lose or win this battle; Sentret will still evolve. Also, it's worth mentioning that if your Sentret is above Level 15, you can just level it up to the next level possible and the evolution scene will still commence.


Assuming everything is correct and your Sentret isn't holding an Everstone, a cutscene should commence. This varies for different games, due to graphical changes.

Keep gaining experience points (XP).,
Use Rare Candies to level up.",How to Evolve Shelgon," As a dragon type, Shelgon is very effective against similar dragon-type Pokémon, dealing twice the normal damage as it would on other Pokémon.


Pure dragon types like Dratini, Dragonair, and Druddigon, especially the ones with lower levels, are good prey for Shelgon.;
, Fairy- and ice-type Pokémon are the ones you should avoid fighting. These types, like Granbull and Clefairy (fairy) or Abomasnow and Regice (ice), will inflict severe to twice the normal damage to Shelgon.


Dragon types are also vulnerable to fellow dragon types, so when facing Pokémon like Axew or another Shelgon, make sure you use the most effective attack on its Skill list to seriously damage the other dragon type, and quickly win the match.

, XP are needed to level up, and Shelgon will evolve into Salamence without any special conditions once it reaches level 50. Continue battling Pokémon that Shelgon is strong against to get easy matches and to earn XP quickly.

, Rare Candy is an in-game food item that instantly increases the level of the Pokémon that eats it. Rare Candies can be found anywhere in the game, from side quests to prizes on certain in-game events, like bug catching. This is a great way to level up your Shelgon without having to do any Pokémon battles.


The number of Rare Candies in every game version is limited, so you may find it hard to evolve Shelgon using Rare Candies alone.

For older versions of the game, you can trade Pokémon with other players using the Game Boy’s cable link connection by going inside a Pokémon Center in any town and talking to the receptionist (non-playable character) in charge.
For newer generations (fourth generation to present), trading Pokémon is done using the Global Trade Stations (GTS). To trade using the GTS, go inside a Pokémon Center in any town, and talk to the receptionist (non-playable character) in charge of the system.

, Ask one of your friends to trade Pokémon with you. Select Seadra from the list and trade it with any Pokémon the other player has or is willing to exchange. Once the other player receives Seadra, its evolution will start and will then change to Kingdra.

, Ask the other player to start another trading system so you can have Kingdra back.

Get a Protector.,
Have Rhydon hold the Protector.,
Go to a Trading Center.,
Trade Rhydon with another player.,
Trade back Rhyperior.",How to Evolve Rhydon," Protector is a kind of evolution-inducing held item, and it kind of looks like the roof of a barn house. These kinds of in-game items trigger the evolution process of certain Pokémon when a particular event happens—such leveling up, trading, or winning a battle—while holding it. The places where you can get a Protector vary depending on the version of the game you’re playing:


Diamond, Platinum, and Pearl—Can be obtained inside the Iron Island and on Route 228.
HeartGold and SoulSilver—Can be obtained inside Mount Mortar.
Black and White—Can be obtained on Route 11 and 13.
Black 2 and White 2—Can be obtained inside the Antique Shop on Join Avenue, inside the Black City, and the Wellspring Cave.
X and Y—Can be obtained inside the Battle Maison and Lost Hotel.
Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire—Can be bought at the Battle Resort.
Sun and Moon—Can be obtained from Kiawe's father in Paniola Town.
To get the Protector, you need to walk around the areas mentioned above. When you step on the hidden area where the item is, a message will appear on the screen saying “Your character has found a Protector,” and the item will be added to your Pocket/Bag.;
, Open your bag, select the Protector from your inventory, and choose Rhydon from the list of Pokémon you can give it to.

, Go to any Pokémon Center inside the game, and talk to the non-playable character inside that is in charge of the game’s Global Trade Station (GTS). In Pokémon X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire, the GTS can be accessed by tapping the GTS option in the Player Search System (PSS) on the bottom screen. In Pokémon Sun and Moon, the GTS can be accessed by pausing and tapping the Festival Plaza option on the bottom screen, then tapping Trade and selecting the GTS option.


GTS is a feature available to newer versions of the game that allows players to trade Pokémon with each other.

, Talk to one of your friends, and ask him to trade Pokémon with you. Select Rhydon from the list, and trade it with any Pokémon your friend has. Once the other player receives Rhydon, it will evolve into its third and final form, Rhyperior.

, After the evolution is done, reverse the trading process and ask your friend or another player to trade Rhyperior back to you.


This step is optional, and you can skip this if you don’t want to get Rhyperior back.

Check evolution requirements.,
Catch it in a Luxury Ball.,
Have it hold a Soothe Bell.,
Walk around with it in your party.,
Feed it vitamins and EV-lowering berries.,
Battle with the Pokemon.,
Give it massages and haircuts.",How to Evolve Pokémon That Require Happiness," Some Pokémon must evolve at a certain time. Below is a list of Pokémon that evolve via happiness, organized by evolution method.


Level up with high happiness: Golbat, Chansey, Pichu, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Togepi, Azurill, Buneary, Munchlax, Woobat, Swadloon, Alola form Meowth, Type: Null.
Level up with high happiness, during the day: Riolu, Budew, Eevee -> Espeon.
Level up with high happiness, at night: Chingling, Eevee -> Umbreon.;
, A Luxury Ball will increase certain happiness-increasing effects by 1. In Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, SoulSilver, Sun, and Moon, the Friend Ball is also a good option, as it sets the caught Pokémon to 200 happiness.

, The Soothe Bell will increase all happiness gains of that Pokémon by 50%.

, You Pokémon will gain happiness after a certain number of steps, which vary by game. Using the bicycle will speed this up (or in the case of Sun and Moon, the Tauros Charge).

, The EV-lowering berries are Pomeg, Kelpsy, Qualot, Hondew, Grepa, and Tamato, and they will lower EVs in a certain stat. The vitamins are HP Up, Protein, Iron, Calcium, Zinc, and Carbos, which increase EVs, as well as Rare Candy, PP Max, and PP Up, though these are rarer. Vitamins increase happiness less than the berries.

, A Pokémon's happiness will be increased when it levels up in battle. However, if it faints, happiness will be decreased by 1, so be sure to heal it or switch it out when at low health.

, They are usually offered once per day, at the following locations:


Gold/Silver/Crystal/HeartGold/SoulSilver: Goldenrod Tunnel (Johto), Daisy Oak's house in Pallet Town (Kanto)
FireRed/LeafGreen: Daisy Oak's house in Pallet Town
Diamond/Pearl/Platinum: Veilstone City, Resort Area
Black/White/Black 2/White 2: Castelia City

Battle using the Pokémon you want to evolve.,
Learn which Pokémon evolve through battle.,
Swap your Pokémon often.,
Use Rare Candy.,
Use special items to help weaker Pokémon level up.,
Learn certain moves.",How to Evolve Pokémon1," The majority of Pokémon evolve when they reach a certain level, and the primary way to level up is to use the Pokémon in battle.;
, While lots of Pokémon evolve when they level up, not all of them do. You can save yourself a lot of time and headache if you know beforehand what it takes to evolve the Pokémon. Sites like PokémonDB can provide detailed charts on what each Pokémon's evolutionary requirements are.

, If you're up against a tough opponent, you can swap out Pokémon mid battle. Not only does this let you fight with a fresh Pokémon, but it also lets you split experience between all the Pokémon that participated.


A key strategy is to use your low-level Pokémon for one turn and the switch to a powerful one. This will let the low-level Pokémon earn a bit of experience for a battle it normally wouldn't survive in.

, Rare Candies are items that will automatically raise your Pokémon to the next level. These are great if you have a stockpile of them and want to quickly bump a Pokémon up, or if you need one more level and it's just taking too long.


Try to avoid using a Rare Candy if your Pokémon is about to level up naturally, otherwise the candy will essentially be wasted.

, Starting Generation II, the Exp. Share item was introduced. Any Pokémon holding this item will receive a share of the battle experience points, even if it did not participate. This is great for sticking a Pokémon on the back burner and coming back to it later. In Generation 6, the Exp Share was changed to a key item which gives experience to all Pokémon in the party when turned on.


There is typically only one Exp. Share per game, but you can receive extras by trading Pokémon that are holding the item. You can also get a second one in Pokémon Black and White from the Pokémon Fan Club chairman.
You can also give Pokémon the Lucky Egg item, which provides a 50% experience bonus to the Pokémon that is holding it. These are rare items, and can usually be found held by wild Chansey.

, There is a small set of Pokémon that evolve only after they have leveled up and learned a specific move. Once they learn the move and level up once, they will evolve into their next form.


Tangela, Yanma, and Piloswine evolve after learning Ancient Power.
Bonsly and Mime Jr. evolve after learning Mimic.
Lickitung evolves after learning Rollout.
Aipom evolves after learning Double Hit.

Learn which Pokémon require high friendship to evolve.,
Raise the friendship level.,
Avoid activities that lower friendship.,
Fulfill the rest of the evolutionary requirements.",How to Evolve Pokémon2," There is a small set of Pokémon that require to raise their friendship levels in order to evolve. Friendship is affected by a variety of factors, including simply being included in the party.


The Pokémon that are evolved through friendship are Golbat, Chansey, Pichu, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Togepi, Azurill, Buneary, Munchlax, Woobat, Swadloon, Eevee, Budew, Riolu, Type: Null, and Chingling.

, Friendship is affected by a lot of different factors, and there are several activities that you can undertake to increase it quickly. The Pokémon must be in your active party in order to gain friendship. The actual values differ from generation to generation. Not every Pokémon needs a maxed-out friendship level to evolve.


Walking in all Pokémon games except the first generation raises friendship. You will gain one point of friendship for every set number of steps (512 in Gen II, 256 in Gen III/IV, 128 in Gen V/VI).
Groomings and Massages will raise the friendship value significantly. You can find NPCs to perform these at various locations throughout the games (after Gen I).
Gaining a level gives a good boost to friendship in every version.
Vitamins will give your Pokémon a quick boost in friendship.

, Just as there are ways to boost friendship, there are also ways it may get lowered. In general, you want to avoid having the Pokémon faint in combat, and avoid using herbal healing items like Revival Herb, Energy Root, Energy Powder, and Heal Powder.


Revival Herbs have the biggest negative effect on the Pokémon's friendship rating.
Trading a Pokémon resets its friendship rating to the base number.

, After you have a high friendship, you'll often have to do something else in order to trigger the evolution. For many, simply leveling up once while having a high friendship will start the evolution.


Some of them will only evolve during a certain time. Budew and Riolu must be leveled up with high friendship during the day, and Chingling during the night. Eevee will evolve into Espeon during the day and Umbreon during the night."
"
Determine which Pokémon evolve with Stones.,
Obtain the Stones.,
Go into your inventory and use the stone on the Pokémon.",How to Evolve Pokémon3," Evolutionary Stones are a selection of Stones that will help certain Pokémon to evolve when they are equipped with it. The number of Pokémon affected by Stones is quite large, and includes Pikachu, Eevee, Staryu, Jigglypuff, and many more.

, The method for obtaining stones varies from game to game and from Stone to Stone. There are a variety of different stone types, all of which affect different Pokémon.


Fire Stone - Evolves Eevee (Flareon), Vulpix, Growlithe, and Pansear.
Water Stone - Evolves Eevee (Vaporeon), Poliwhirl (Poliwrath), Shellder, Lombre, Staryu, and Panpour.
Thunder Stone - Evolves Eevee (Jolteon), Pikachu, and Eelektrik.
Leaf Stone - Evolves Gloom (Vileplume), Weepinbell, Exeggcute, Nuzleaf, and Pansage.

Dawn Stone - Evolves female Snorunt (Froslass) and male Kirlia (Gallade).
Ice Stone - Evolves Alolan Sandshrew and Alolan Vulpix

, It will evolve immediately. Many of these Pokémon cannot learn many new attacks via level-up after they evolve, so you may want to have it learn anything it needs before doing so.

"
"
Determine which Pokémon evolve through trading.,
Determine if the Pokémon requires a special item as well.,
Trade the Pokémon.",How to Evolve Pokémon4," Some Pokémon can only be evolved when they are traded from one player to another. This means you will need a trade partner who is willing to trade you back your evolved Pokémon, or who has something you want in return.


Pokémon that evolve via trading are Kadabra, Machoke, Graveler, Haunter, Boldore, Gurdurr, Phantump, and Pumpkaboo.

, Many of the Pokémon that require a trade to evolve also need to be holding special items when they are traded.


These Pokémon are Clamperl (Huntail with Deep Sea Tooth, Gorebyss with Deep Sea Scale), Dusclops (Reaper Cloth), Electabuzz (Electirizer), Feebas (Prism Scale), Magmar (Magmarizer), Onix (Metal Coat), Poliwhirl (Politoed, King's Rock), Porygon (Upgrade), Porygon2 (Dubious Disk), Rhydon (Protector), Scyther (Metal Coat), Seadra (Dragon Scale), Slowpoke (Slowking, King's Rock), Spritzee (Sachet), and Swirlix (Whipped Dream). Shelmet and Karrablast evolve if traded for each other.

, You can initiate trades from the second floor of a Pokémon Center depending on which Pokémon game you have. Connect your Game Boy to a friend's either over a wireless network or via link cable (depending on the game). Enter the second floor of the Pokémon Center and select TRADE from the console. The evolution will occur immediately after the trade has finished.

Evolve Pancham.,
Evolve Inkay.,
Evolve Tyrunt and Yungoos.,
Evolve Amaura.,
Evolve Sliggoo.,
Evolve Eevee.,





Nosepass, Charjabug and Magneton will evolve when leveled up at areas with magnetic fields.,

Sneasel evolves by holding Razor Claw at night.",How to Evolve Pokémon5," Wurmple will randomly evolve into either Silcoon or Cascoon at level 7 depending on its hidden personality stats. These stats cannot be influenced.

, When Tyrogue hits level 20, it will evolve into Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, or Hitmontop. The result depends on the Attack stat versus the Defense Stat. If Attack is higher than Defense, you get Hitmonlee. If Defense is higher than Attack, you get Hitmonchan. If they are equal, you get Hitmontop.

, In Generations 3 and 4, Feebas must have a high beauty stat in order to evolve. Accomplish this by feeding it the right PokéBlocks. In later generations, it can be traded holding a Prism Scale.

, Nincada needs to reach level 20, and you also need a Poke Ball in your inventory and an empty slot in your group. If you meet these conditions, you will get Shedinja and Ninjask.

, You will need a Remoraid in your party, and then you need to level Mantyke up (the level doesn't matter). This will reward you with Mantine.

, You must level Pancham to at least level 32, and also have a Dark-type Pokémon in your party. If you meet these conditions, you will receive Pangoro.

, In order to evolve Inkay into Malamar, level it up while holding the 3DS upside down. It must be at least level 30.

, You will need to get Tyrunt to at least level 39 and Yungoos to atleast level 20. After that, level it up during the day to trigger its evolution into Tyrantrum or Gumshoos.

, Like Tyrunt, you will need to get Amaura to at least level 39. After that, level it up during the night to trigger its evolution into Aurorus.

, Get Sliggoo up to at least level 50. Then, level it up during a rainstorm to evolve it into Goodra., Eevee is one of the more unique Pokémon, and can be evolved in multiple ways for different results. You can use Evolution Stones, raise its friendship, or evolve it in specific locations. Leveling up your Eevee near a Moss Rock will evolve it into Leafeon, and an Ice Rock will make it into a Glaceon. It evolves into Sylveon when leveled up with two affection hearts in Pokémon Amie and a Fairy type move.

, These include New Mauville in Hoenn (Gen 6), Mt. Coronet, Spear Pillar, and Hall of Origin in Sinnoh, Chargestone Cave in Unova, Route 13 in Kalos, and Vast Poni Canyon in Alola., Gligar evolves by holding Razor Fang at night, and Happiny evolves by holding Oval Stone during the day."

Level up easily by battling types that are weak against fire.,
Avoid fighting types that fire is weak against.,
Bring lots of potions into battle.,
Bring items that heal status conditions.,
Have Ponyta eat Rare Candies.",How to Evolve Ponyta," Fire-types are strong against Grass (like Bulbasaur, Bellsprout), Bug (Parasect, Caterpie), Ice (Dewgong, Abomasnow), and Steel-types (Steelix, Aggron). Fire-types like Ponyta will inflict twice the normal damage when it attacks any of these types during battle, allowing you to get easy wins and level up faster.


Ponyta evolves to Rapidash only when it reaches level 40, so winning Pokémon battles easy and fast will greatly help speed up leveling.;
, On the contrary, Fire-types are seriously weak against Water (like Squirtle and Gyarados), Rock (Onyx, Geodude), and Ground-types (Diglet, Dugtrio). If Ponyta receives any attack from these kinds of Pokémon, it will take twice the normal damage.


Fighting lower level of these types can still beat Ponyta. If you encounter any of these types, call Ponyta back to the Pokéball or flee from the battle to save time and HP.
Sometimes the Pokémon you are battling will not allow you to flee. Prepare for when this happens by buying some Pokédolls or Pokétoys.

, Taking lots of potions with you will greatly save time, without having to go back to towns and get Ponyta healed in Pokémon Centers. Once Ponyta’s HP gets low, open your Bag (by pressing the Start button) and use a potion on Ponyta to restore its health.

, Some Pokémon have skills that affect its opponents even after the battle. Moves like “Sing” or “Poison Sting” can put your Pokémon to sleep or poison it even after the battle. Leaving Ponyta with these conditions will either render Ponyta unusable on battles or slowly drain its life points.


Items like “Awakening” and “Antidote” removes sleep or poison status conditions, respectively, on your Pokémon and are used the same way as potions (step 3).
On the other, status-removing items removes only the status condition and not restore life points. You’ll still need potions to restore Ponyta’s health.

, If you don’t want to level up Ponyta by grinding and doing the work, you can always use Rare Candies. These items raise any Pokémon’s level by 1 instantly, without having to gain any XP points.


This is perfect for saving time, but each game version only have a limited number of Rare Candies available inside, so it’s a little bit impossible to raise Ponyta all the way up to level 40 using only Rare Candies.

Level Pichu up once you think it's Friendship is around 220.",How to Evolve Pichu1," This is a special Poke Ball that sets the base Friendship stat for the Pokémon caught in it to 200, instead of the usual 70. Since Pichu evolves at 220 Friendship, you don't have much to do to get it to that level if you capture the Pichu in a Friend Ball.


You can get Friend Balls from Kurt in Azalea Town if you bring him Green Apricorns.;
, You'll gain 1 Friendship point for every 512 steps that you walk in game. This is one of the easier ways to passively earn Friendship.

, You can find the Haircut Brothers in Goldenrod Tunnel. The younger brother gives the biggest boost; up to 10 Friendship per haircut. You can only get a haircut once every 24 hours.

, You can find Daisy Oak at Pallet Town between 3 and 4 PM. Getting Pichu groomed by Daisy will gain 3 Friendship.

, There are several items in the game that are considered ""Vitamins"". Every time you give Pichu one of these, you'll gain between 3 to 5 Friendship:


HP Up
Protein
Iron
Calcium
Carbos
PP Up
Rare Candy

, Pichu will gain Friendship every time it levels up. if Pichu has less than 100 Friendship, it will gain 5 per level. If it has between 100 and 200, it will gain 3. Above 200, you'll gain 2 Friendship per level.

, Challenging a Gym Leader or Elite Four member while Pichu is in your party will give it a small boost of 1-3 Friendship.

, If Pichu faints during battle, you'll lose 1 Friendship. Make sure to switch Pichu out if it looks like it's going to faint. Don't use healing items, though (more on that in the next step).

, If Pichu's health is low, try not to give it any healing items, including Energy Powder (-5 Friendship), Heal Powder (-5 Friendship), Energy Root (-10 Friendship), or Revival Herb (-15 Friendship).


Do all of your healing and reviving at a Pokémon Center, which will not affect your Friendship.

, You won't be able to find a number for Pichu's Friendship. Make sure Pichu is the first Pokémon in your party. You can find the Friendship checker lady in the house to the east of the Goldenrod City Department Store. She'll say a different phrase depending on Pichu's Friendship level:50 - 99: ""You should treat it better. It's not used to you.""
100 - 149: ""It's quite cute.""
150 - 199: ""It's friendly toward you. Sort of happy.""
200 - 249: ""I get the feeling it really trusts you.""
250 - 255: ""It looks really happy! It must love you a lot.""

, Pichu's Friendship must be at 220 or higher in order to evolve. The Friendship checker will not tell you exactly when you hit 220, so you'll have to do a bit of guesswork. You can level Pichu up by battling or by giving it a Rare Candy.


If Pichu doesn't evolve, it's Friendship is not 220. Remember, the Friendship checker says the same phrase from 200 - 249, so you'll have to do a little bit of estimating as to your actual Friendship level.

Level up Pichu once you feel its Friendship is 220.",How to Evolve Pichu2," A Luxury Ball will give a bonus point to every Friendship-boosting activity. You can buy Luxury Balls from most stores.

, If Pichu is holding this item, it will gain an additional Friend point for every Friendship-boosting activity. This stacks with the Luxury Ball, meaning if you use both Pichu will gain 2 extra points every time you perform a Friendship-boosting activity.


You can find a Soothe Bell at the Pokémon Fan Club.

, The walking requirements for gaining Friendship were cut in half for Generation III, meaning you'll get a point every 256 steps. This offsets the lack of grooming options for your Pokémon in the Generation III games.

, Vitamin items give you a 2 - 5 point boost depending on your current Friendship level (the higher the Friendship, the lower the boost). Vitamins include all of the vitamins in Generation II, as well as the following additions:


Zinc
PP Max

, If Pichu has less than 100 Friendship, it will get a 5-point boost every time it levels up. This drops to a 3-point boost over 100, and a 2-point boost over 200.

, If you are deep into EV-training, you may be using EV-Berries on a regular basis. Any EV-lowering berries will give you a 2-point boost. These include:


Pomeg
Kelpsy
Qualot
Hondew
Grepa
Tamato

, If Pichu faints during a battle, it will lose a Friendship point. Switch Pichu out if it looks like it's going to get knocked out soon. Don't use any healing items either (see the next step).

, Healing items have the largest negative effect on Friendship in the game. Do all of your healing and reviving at a Pokémon Center.Energy Powder: -5 points
Heal Powder: -5 points
Energy Root: -10 points
Revival Herb: -15 points

, While you can't see an exact number for your Friendship level, you can talk to a special Friendship checker character to get an approximation of your current level. You can find her in Verdanturf Town, in the house in the bottom-left corner. Make sure Pichu is the first Pokémon in your party and she will say a different phrase depending on your Friendship level.


50 - 99: ""It's not very used to you yet. It neither loves nor hates you.""
100 - 149: ""It's getting used to you. It seems to believe in you.""
150 - 199: ""It likes you quite a lot. It seems to want to be babied a little.""
200 - 254: ""It seems to be very happy. It obviously likes you a whole lot.""
255: ""It adores you. It can't possibly love you any more. I even feel happy seeing it.""

, If Pichu's Friendship is 220 or higher, it will evolve into Pikachu when leveling up. If Pichu doesn't evolve, it means its Friendship isn't a high enough level.

Walk with Pichu in your party.,
Get your Pichu a massage.,
Use Vitamins to gain Friendship.,
Level Pichu up for a Friendship boost.,
Use EV-lowering berries.,
Don't let Pichu get knocked out.,
Don't use any healing items on Pichu.,
Check your Pichu's Friendship (Generation IV).,
Check your Pichu's Friendship (Generation V).,
Level Pichu up once you think it is at Friendship level 220 or higher.",How to Evolve Pichu3," Like Generation III, these will give your Pichu a Friendship boost. They work a little differently in Generation IV though; the Luxury Ball only gives a bonus when leveling up and walking, and the Soothe Bell will give a 50% boost to all Friendship activities.

, Like Generation III, you'll gain 1 Friendship every 256 steps. You'll gain a bonus if your Pichu is in a Luxury Ball.

, There are a couple of different massage locations that can give you a Friendship boost. You can only get one massage every 24 hours.


Diamond, Pearl, Platinum - The massage girl in Veilstone City will give you a 3-point boost.
Diamond, Pearl, Platinum - A massage at the Ribbon Syndicate will give you a 20-point(!) boost if your Friendship is less than 100.
Black and White - A massage from the lady on Castelia Street can give you up to 30 Friendship points.
Black 2 and White 2 - The massage lady can be found at the Medal Office, and gives the same bonuses as the one from Black and White.

, Like the previous Generations, Vitamin items will give you a good Friendship boost. No new Vitamins were introduced in Generation IV or V.

, You'll get a few Friendship points every time Pichu levels up

, EV-lowering berries can give you a big boost in Friendship. Give your Pichu Pomeg, Kelpsy, Qualot, Hondew, Grepa, or Tamato berries for up to 10 Friendship, depending on the current Friendship level.

, Like all other Generations, getting knocked out will lower Pichu's Friendship by 1. Switch Pichu out with another Pokémon if it looks like it's going to faint.

, Healing items have a major negative effect on your Friendship, and it can take a while to make the loss back. Avoid the following items, and do all of your healing at a Pokémon Center instead:


Energy Powder: -5 points
Heal Powder: -5 points
Energy Root: -10 points
Revival Herb: -15 points

, If you're playing the Generation IV games, you can check Pichu's happiness by visiting the Pokémon Fan Club in Hearthome City. Make sure Pichu is the first Pokémon in your party. The phrase that the checker says will change depending on Pichu's Friendship level, and the phrases for Platinum are different.


50 - 99: ""You should treat it better. It's not used to you."" (D,P) ""It's feeling neutral toward you. It's up to you to change that."" (Plat)
100 - 149: ""It's quite cute."" (D,P) ""It's warming up to you. That's my impression."" (Plat)
150 - 199: ""It's friendly towards you. It looks sort of happy."" (D,P) ""It's quite friendly to you. It must be happy being with you."" (Plat)
200 - 254: ""I get the feeling that it really trusts you."" (D,P) ""It's very friendly toward you. I can tell you treat it kindly."" (Plat)
255: ""It looks really happy! It must love you a lot."" (D,P) ""It simply adores you! Why, I feel like I am intruding!"" (Plat)

, If you're playing the Generation V games, you can find the Friendship checker at the Pokémon Fan Club in Icirrus City. The phrase will change depending on Pichu's Friendship level:


70 - 99: ""The relationship is neither good nor bad… It looks neutral.""
100 - 149: ""It is a little friendly to you… That's what I'm getting.""
150 - 194: ""It is friendly to you. It must be happy with you.""
195 - 254: ""It is quite friendly to you! You must be a kind person!""
255: ""It is super friendly to you! I'm a bit jealous!""

, Since you won't know the exact number unless you're checking in every time you raise your friendship, you'll have to guess based on the phrase and the actions you perform. When you level up Pichu when it has a Friendship of 220 or greater it will evolve immediately into Pikachu.


If Pichu doesn't evolve when leveled up, then its Friendship is not at 220 yet.

, Like all Pokémon games, Vitamins will boost your Friendship by up to 5 (plus any bonuses). No new Vitamins have been introduced since Generation III., Wings are items that are similar to Vitamins, but a little less powerful. They can be found randomly on the Driftveil Drawbridge and Marvelous Bridge. Wings can give you up to 3 Friendship., When Pichu levels up in battle, you'll gain up to 5 Friendship. In Generation VI, levels attained by Rare Candy will not be rewarded with a Friendship Bonus, Use the Super Training feature in Generation VI to boost Pichu's Friendship.

You'll need berries to create the juices.

Rare Soda - 1 Lansat and 1 Starf Berry
Colorful Shake - Any two berries
Ultra Rare Soda - 1 Roseli and 1 Enigma
Any colored juice

, Getting knocked out will drop your Friendship by 1, so make sure to pull Pichu out if its about to faint.

The second value below applies if your Friendship is over 200.

Energy Powder: -5/-10 points
Heal Powder: -5/-10 points
Energy Root: -10/-15 points
Revival Herb: -15/-20 points

, You can find an estimation of your Pichu's Friendship level by visiting the checker in the Pokémon Fan Club in Laverre City. Make sure Pichu is the first Pokémon in your party. If you're playing Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire, see the Generation III instructions.

50 - 99: ""Hmm…I think you have a lot of time ahead of you to get to know one another better.""
100 - 149: ""It's a little bit friendly to you… Something like that.""
150 - 199: ""Well, I think you and Pichu will be an even greater combo someday!""
200 - 254: ""You must really like your Pichu and always keep it by your side!""
255: ""It's amazingly friendly toward you! It must be so happy spending every day with you!""

, You'll have to guess since the checker only tells you the range you're in. You can level Pichu up through battle or by using a Rare Candy, Rare Soda, or Ultra Rare Soda.

If Pichu doesn't evolve, its Friendship is not 220.

This means that you can't evolve Lickitung unless you are playing a Generation IV or later game.
, You can transfer Pokémon from III to IV, but you'll need to beat both games first in order to do so.

You cannot transfer Pokémon from Generation I or II to Generation IV.

You don't need to weaken the Pokémon at all before throwing the ball., Lickitung needs to know this move in order to evolve into Lickilicky. The TM for Rollout was only available in Generation II, and can't be used for this. Below are a couple ways that you can learn this move., Likitung will learn this move automatically at Level 33. You can level it up by battling, leaving it at the Day Care center, or by using Rare Candy. This is the easiest way to learn the move., In Platinum talk to the Move Tutor at the Survival Area. Rollout costs four red shards, two green shards, and two blue shards. In HeartGold or SoulSilver, talk to the Move Tutor in the top-right of the Frontier.

Select ""Mega Evolve"" during battle to turn into Mega Gyarados.",How to Evolve Magikarp," While there isn't really any benefit to leveling up Magikarp longer than you have to in order to get it to evolve, there are some cases when keeping a Magikarp may be more desirable.


A Shiny Magikarp is a very good trophy, and the Pokémon that it evolves into (Shiny Gyarados) is one of the most common Shiny Pokémon in the game.
You can try to raise a Magikarp to Level 100 for a challenge. A Level 100 Magikarp will also make for pretty good trading stock, as it's really tough to get.
At Level 30, Magikarp learns Flail. This is a very powerful move if your Pokémon is injured, which can make it a risky choice. If Flail suits your playstyle, it can be one of Gyarados's most powerful moves, and may be worth holding the evolution off until your Magikarp has learned it.;
, Magikarp will start trying to evolve once it reaches Level 20. You can keep it from evolving by holding ""B"" during the evolution, or you can let it evolve into Gyarados.


See the next section for some ways to get Magikarp to Level 20 easily.

, You'll need to do this for most battles, as Magikarp doesn't have any attacks in its lower levels. As long as the Magikarp is in for one round, it will get a share of the experience.

, This is an item that allows the Pokémon holding it to receive a portion of the experience gained from a battle, even if it didn't participate. It will still need to be in the active party, but you don't have to worry about switching it in and out of battles.

, You can drop Magikarp off at the Day Care Center in the game to have it automatically gain experience. This will take a while, since the experience gain in the Day Care is slow, but you don't have to fight any battles or keep it in your active party.


Your Magikarp won't evolve in the Day Care Center, even if it surpasses Level 20. It will immediately try to evolve after its first battle when you retrieve it if it meets the level requirements.

, If you have a stack of Rare Candies, you can quickly get your Magikarp up to the level that you want. When you feed it a candy that turns it from Level 19 to Level 20, it will start to evolve.

Load the game in your regular emulator.",How to Evolve Graveler," You need to trade Graveler with someone who has a game from the same Generation. For example, you can trade between Red and Blue (Generation I) or Diamond and Pearl (Generation III). You cannot trade between Blue and Pearl.


You cannot use a DS to trade between Generation III games. This is due to the lack of a link cable port on the DS.
If you are playing on an emulator, click here.;
, This is required for trading in Generations I-IV. In Generation V and later, you can select any of your Pokémon.


Make sure Graveler is not holding an Everstone. This prevents evolutions.

, How you connect varies depending on the system.


Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance - Use a link cable to connect two of the systems. You cannot connect different versions of the Game Boy.
Nintendo DS - You can connect wirelessly within 30 feet. Generation V games can also connect via IR built-in to the cartridge. Use the C-Gear in the game. Click here for a guide on trading with the DS.
Nintendo 3DS/2DS - Press the L and R buttons and select Player Search System. This will allow you to trade with the other nearby system. You can also connect to the internet and trade online. Make sure that your partner trades the evolved Golem back to you., It will evolve into Golem as soon as it is traded. Graveler's level doesn't matter.


See if your friend has a Pokémon that evolves through trading as well. That way you can knock them both out at once. Pokémon that require trades include Clamperl, Electabuzz, Feebas, and more., Your new Golem will be on the other system. Have your friend trade it back to you to get your Golem.

, Since it's not possible to trade using an emulator, you'll need to use a workaround to evolve Graveler (and other Pokémon that rely on trading to evolve). If you're playing Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver, you can use a fan-made hack to change Graveler into a Pokémon that evolves when it reaches Level 50. This only works on the US versions of these ROM files.

, You'll need to download the custom ROM editor from this forum. Follow the link at the top of the first post to download the editor, which is a very small file. Extract the files from the ZIP once you've downloaded it.

, Run NitroExplorer2b.exe to start the editor. You may be prompted to install the .NET Framework files if they aren't already installed on your computer.

, Press the ""Load ROM"" button and browse for your Pokémon ROM file.

, The file you need to select varies depending on the game you are modifying:


Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum - Open the ""poketool"" folder, and then open the ""personal"" folder. Select the ""evo.narc"" file.
HeartGold, SoulSilver - Open the ""a"" folder, then the ""0"" folder, followed by the ""3"" folder. Select the ""4"" file.

, This will open the file browser.

, there should be a ""4"" file in the same folder as NitroExplorer2b.exe. Select this file to insert into the ROM.

, After replacing the file, you can start up your emulator and play your game. Graveler will now evolve into Golem at Level 50., You normally cannot trade between emulators, making it difficult to get Graveler to evolve. There is a special version of the VBA emulator called VBALink that allows you to run up to four instances of it at once. This lets you trade between the instances, but requires a bit of work to get going.

, You'll find this process much easier if you keep everything you need in one spot. Create a folder called ""vbalink"" or something similar on your Desktop.

, You can download the VBALink emulator from vbalink.info. Download the ""1.72"" file and extract the contents into your new folder.

, These configuration files will make the trading process much smoother. Download the ZIP containing the three INI files from this forum thread. Extract the files into the same ""vbalink"" folder that the emulator files are in.

, Copy the ROM file you normally use into the ""vbalink"" folder.

, You'll need a saved game that is far enough in the game to allow for trading. The requirements for trading vary depending on the game.

, Copy the "".sav"" file and paste it twice into the ""vbalink"" folder. This will leave you with the original and two copies.

, Right-click the first copied saved game and select ""Rename"". Change the extension from "".sav"" to "".sa1"". Repeat the process for the second file, changing the extension to "".sa2"". You should now have a "".sav"", a "".sa1"", and a "".sa2"" file in the ""vbalink"" folder.


If you don't see file extensions, click the ""View"" tab in Explorer and check the ""File name extensions"" box.

, Double-click the ""VisualBoyAdvance.exe"" program to start the emulator. Click ""File"" → ""Open"" and select your ROM file from the ""gbalink"" folder.

, Walk upstairs and stand in front of the lady who will start the trade process. Do not talk to her yet.


The controls for the first window are WASD to move, Q for A, E for B, and Z for Select.

, Make sure that ""Pause when inactive window"" is not checked.

, Double-click ""VisualBoyAdvance.exe"" again to start another instance of VBAlink in another window. Drag this window to the right side of your screen. Click ""File"" → ""Open"" and select the same ROM file as you did before.

, The controls for this window are different. Press TFGH to move, R for A, Y for B, and V for Select. Move the character to the Pokémon Center and stand in front of the trade lady.

, The game may hang for a few seconds, just be patient and avoid hitting more keys. Choose the ""Trade"" option from the menu.

, This will make the character on the right screen speak to the trade lady. Select the ""Trade"" option. After a few moments, the trade interface should appear on both screens.

, You'll only be keeping one of the save files, so pay attention to which screen you trade it to. Graveler will evolve into Golem as soon as it is traded.

, After trading, you'll receive a notification that your game has saved. You can close your emulators at this point.

, Select the save file you want to keep. If you are keeping the save file from the left screen, select the "".sa1"" file. If you are keeping the save file from the right screen, select the "".sa2"" file. Copy and paste the selected file back into your original emulator's directory.

, Copy and paste the "".sav"" file in your emulator directory to somewhere else in case the new file doesn't work. You can move your old save back if something goes wrong.

, Change the extension of the "".sa1"" or "".sa2"" file to "".sav"".

, You should be able to load your game from your new save file with your newly-evolved Golem.


If your game doesn't work, copy the ""vba.ini"" file from the ""gbalink"" folder into your regular emulator folder.

Find out your friendship stat.,

Don't feed Munchlax bitter things.,
Common bitter items:


Heal Powder
Energy Powder
Energy Root
Revival Herb

,
Get a professional massage.,
Utilize the bolstering effects of the Soothe Bell.You can find this item in different places, like the Pokémon Mansion, or in some cases you may receive it from non-player characters.,
Train to level up.,
Don't allow Munchlax to faint.,
Level up after cementing your bond of friendship!",How to Evolve Munchlax in Pokémon1," Unfortunately, no matter how hard you train, your Munchlax won't evolve unless you have a friendship stat of 220 or higher.The version you are playing will dictate the options available for checking your friendship with Munchlax. Common ways of checking friendship are:



Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum have a feature called the ""Friendship Checker"" as part of your poketech.

HeartGold and SoulSilver gauge friendship by the phrase that appears when you interact with your Pokémon outside the pokeball.

Nacrene City and Icirrus Pokemon Fan Club both have characters that can rate your friendship in Black and White.
""Icirrus Pokémon Fan Club"" and Bianca tell you your happiness in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2
In Pokémon X and Y, in Laverre City and Santalune City you can check your friendship.
In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, it is the same as the original games.;
, Take Munchlax along on your adventures and gain +1 or +2 to your friendship stat for every 128 or 256 steps. The rate of increase will change according to version and your current friendship level., Things that make your Pokémon healthy, happy, and strong give your friendship stat a boost.

, Throughout the game you will find herbs, roots, and medicine that have different effects on your Pokemon. Bitter flavors, however, hurt your Munchlax's friendship stat and can interfere with it's evolution.,, In certain versions, there is an option for you to take your Pokémon to a resort or massage therapist. After a good rub down, your Munchlax will appreciate your friendship even more.


Veilstone, Castelia City, and the Resort Area by route 229 are three locations that offer Pokémon massages., Holding this will foster greater friendship between you and Munchlax.

, When your Munchlax reaches a new level, he'll feel thankful he has such a good trainer and your friendship will grow.

, Taking your Munchlax into battle is a good way to raise its level, but allowing your Munchlax to faint will reduce your friendship stat and make it more difficult for Munchlax to trust you enough to evolve.

, Now that your friendship stat is at or over 220, all little Munchlax needs is some experience or a rare candy and he'll transform into a strapping Snorlax.

"
"
Trade a Cinccino for a Munchlax in Undella town.Be aware that this event is synced with real time, and it will only be available to you in the summer.

,

, The Munchlax you receive from your trade will be level 60 already. Raise your friendship to 220 or above using the advice from the section on making friends with your Munchlax. It will evolve at the next level.

, This is a quick way of forcing the evolution now that you and your Munchlax are good friends. After you use the rare candy, the evolution sequence for Munchlax should begin.

Get an Oval Stone.,
If you don't already have a Happiny, get one.,
Wait for daytime to arrive.,
Give the Oval Stone to Happiny.,
Level Happiny up once.,
Watch Happiny evolve.",How to Evolve Happiny," Oval Stones are evolution-inducing items that can be given to your Pokémon for them to hold. Once your Pokémon has an Oval Stone, leveling up at the right time will make the Pokémon evolve. To get an Oval Stone, simply walk around the areas where they are found. When your character walks on the correct square of floor (which is assigned at random), a message prompt with “Your character has found an Oval Stone"" will appear. Below, find the locations in each game where you can find Oval Stones:Diamond/Pearl/Platinum: Lost Tower; the Underground; found on wild Happiny and Chansey

Heart Gold/SoulSilver: Rock Tunnel; Bug Catching Contest (first prize); Amity Meadow; found on wild Chansey

Black/White: Challenger's Cave; Black City shop B; during Dust Clouds; found on wild Happiny

Black 2/White 2: Dust clouds inside the Relic Passage, Rebirth Mountain, and Clay Tunnel; White Forest

X/Y: Unknown Dungeon (hidden on a rock to the left of Mewtwo); PokéMileage Club (balloon popping, level 2)

Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire: Found on wild Happiny

Sun/Moon: Paniola Ranch; ""Path for Brilliant-Stone Hunting!"" mission of Isle Aphun in Poké Pelago (available starting at Rank 2);
, Happiny is available in all games from Generation IV onwards. It doesn't matter which level the Happiny you catch is — with the Oval Stone method, you can evolve one at any level. Below, find the locations in each game where you can find Happiny:Diamond/Pearl: Trophy Garden; hatch the egg from the trainer in Hearthome City

Platinum: Trophy Garden

HeartGold/SoulSilver: Breed Chansey or Blissey equipped with a Luck Incense

Black: Trade only

White: White Forest

Black 2/White 2: Hatch the egg from the trainer in Nacrene Gate

Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire: Mirage Forest, Mirage Mountain

Sun/Moon: Route 1, Route 4, Route 5, Route 6, Hau'oli City, Lush Jungle (only available by being called as an ally Pokémon in all cases)

, Happiny will only evolve into Chansey in the daytime. From the fourth generation of Pokémon games onward (which also happen to be the games that Happiny is available in), the in-game time is the same as the time on your device's clock (and thus the real-world time if your clock is accurate.) Note that the Pokémon definition for ""daytime"" varies from game to game. See below for more information on each generation's ""daytime"":Generation IV (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum/HeartGold/SoulSilver): 10:00 AM-7:59 PM

Generation V (Black/White/Black 2/White 2):

Spring: 10:00 AM-4:59 PM
Summer: 9:00 AM-6:59 PM
Autumn: 10:00 AM-5:59 PM
Winter: 11:00 AM-4:59 PM



Generation VI (X/Y/Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire): 11:00 AM - 5:59 PM

Generation VII (Sun/Moon): 6:00 AM - 6:00 PM (Sun), 6:00 PM - 6:00 AM (Moon, which takes place 12 hours ahead of your device's clock)

, Once you have an Oval Stone in your bag and a Happiny with you, you're all set! Start by opening your Bag and selecting the Oval Stone. Select “Give” from the small menu that pops up, then choose Happiny from your list of Pokémon.


If you've done this right, message should appear on the screen telling you that Happiny is now holding the Oval Stone. Happiny will keep the Oval Stone until you give it something different or it evolves.

, Now, get into battles with enemy Pokémon and start winning. The precise Pokémon you fight don't matter — they can be Pokémon you find in the wild or Pokémon from an enemy trainer. As long as you win, Happiny participates in the battle, and Happiny survives until the end of the fight, it will gain experience.


If you're in an area with many difficult Pokémon and you don't want to risk having your low-level Happiny faint, you may want to use an Exp. Share item, which allows even Pokémon that don't participate in the battle to gain experience points.Other things that can boost the rate of experience gain include having a high affection level in Pokémon Amie (Gen VI) or Pokémon Refresh (Gen VII) and having Pass Power (Gen V) or O-Power (Gen VI) active.

, When you get Happiny enough experience points to level up, it should start to evolve immediately. Congratulations! You now have Chansey.


Note that your Oval Stone will disappear after the evolution.
Keep an eye on the clock as you get your Happiny experience points. If you battle long enough that your Happiny levels up during the night, it will not evolve into Chansey and you'll need to wait for daytime or adjust the clock and try again.

Find chests.",How to Get a Handgun in Terraria," Getting a Handgun can be hard if you are not prepared, so take as many health and mana potions (if you’re a mage class) you can with you.
, You can craft a bed using a Sawmill. To craft one, you will need 15 Wood and 5 Silk.

If you don’t have a Sawmill, craft one at the Crafting Table using 10 Wood, 2 Iron/Lead Bars, and 1 Chain.
If you don’t want to craft, you can take a bed from abandoned houses.

, This is used to light up your respawn room.

You can craft a torch with Wood and Gel, or you can buy one from a merchant for 50 coins.

, Bring enough blocks to make a decent-sized room to respawn in. Also bring some wall blocks to fill in the room you will be making., This can be any weapon of your choice; just make sure you have one., The Handgun is only obtainable through the chests found in the dungeon. The dungeon is located at one end of the map, usually opposite the jungle, so head there.


If you still can’t find the dungeon, try walking to one edge of the map. If you find that you’ve reach the ocean, this means that the dungeon is at the other end of the map.

, Once you’ve reached the dungeon, it is recommended that you build a respawn point. The process of building a room is slightly different depending on the platform you’re playing Terraria on:


For PC, hit the ESC key or press the number that the block is assigned to to equip the block then left-click on the area you want to place the block in.
For Xbox, open the inventory menu (Y) and use the D-pad to navigate and highlight a block you want to use. Press A once the block is highlighted, and use the right analog stick to set your cursor to the area you want to place the block in.
For mobile, hit the icon at the end of the Item slots to open the inventory menu. Tap and drag the block you want to use into one of the first five item slots at the top of the inventory menu. Tap the block in the item slot then tap on the area you want to place the block in to build the bedroom.
The minimum required width of a room for respawning in is 9, and the height, 4.

, Cover the room with wall blocks to prevent mobs from spawning there., Open your inventory (ESC on PC, icon on mobile, or Y on Xbox 360), and select the bed. Once you have the bed selected, tap, press A, or click on the area you want to place the bed in.

, Right-click (PC), B button (Xbox 360), or tap (mobile) the bed to set your spawn point. You will get a “Spawn Point Added” notification at the lower-right corner of your screen., Head to the entrance of the dungeon and walk through the door., First you must journey down into the dungeon and fight the mobs there. Along the way, you’ll find chests scattered randomly in the dungeon, and one may contain a Handgun.

Since contents of the chests are random, there’s no guarantee that you’ll get a Handgun on the first, second, or even third run into the dungeon. You’ll just have to be patient and continue going through the dungeon and opening chests until you get a Handgun.
If you die, you will respawn at the bed in the bedroom you built before entering the dungeon.

Done!",How to Destroy the Destroyer on Terraria," He is a boss similar to EoW, since they both share the Worm AI. However he is much, much longer, and a little thicker. Each unit of his body has a red flashing light, which eventually detaches and becomes a Probe, which fires lasers at you. Once defeated, he drops Souls of Might.
, You could try a Dao of Pow (flail weapons are good for these types of boss), a Hallowed Helmet (don't even try to get it--it's hard, but I'll write an article on it later), and Mythril Boots and Chestplate. You will also need a good amount of greater healing potions, which can be crafted from a bottle of water, some Pixie Dust, and some Crystal Shards., You need to make a Mechanical Worm, which is crafted from 6 rotten chunks, 5 iron bars, 5 copper bars, and 7 Souls of Night. He can only be spawned at night., He spawns off screen, so be ready and waiting. Unlike the EoW, Destroyer likes to get underground and zip up at you at an almost straight vertical angle. From then on, just attack him and his Probes until he dies. If your health gets low, drink a GHP (Greater Healing Potion). If your health gets really low and the cool-down for healing potions isn't up yet, then teleport home to the nurse and heal up.

Be careful if you do, because he might kill a few of your NPCs.

, There, you will find 4 NPCs near a floating tablet. Kill all of the cultists and fight the Lunatic Cultist! It has quite a variety of attacks, so crowd control weapons are usually recommended.

, If you're lucky, you will spawn right next to it. The Vortex Pillar is a neon blue pillar with a stormy background.

, This will help on the next pillar.

, The Stardust Pillar is a light blue pillar with a starry background. The strategy here is to kill Stardust Cells, let them regenerate, then kill them again. This is where the Phantasm will come in handy.

, It will help on the next pillar.

, The solar pillar is a red-orange pillar with a volcanic background. The strategy here is to camp in a closed-off area, and do not get off the ground. This is where the Stardust Dragon Staff will come in handy.

, This will help on the next pillar.

This may seem obvious, but build a huge wall around your house, like a castle.
,

Make your ""base"" a series of different buildings, and connect them with Teleporters.,
Put Lava on the roof.,
Store your NPCs in different houses, or in a special area of your house.,Make specials arenas to fight bosses, as some can phase through the walls of your house (like the Eye of Cthulhu).,
Make some decoy chests.",How to Defend Your House in Terraria,", Although most players will be able to see it, enemies will not.

Build the pit right up against your door. Most enemy's AI will tell them to jump the pit, but if you build your door next to the pit, they'll bounce back into the hole.

, You can man them from inside with a Lever/Switch.

You can also install a pressure plate, which activates the Traps once stepped on.

, Dig a pit seven blocks wide and six blocks deep. On each side of the pit, dig out the fourth block up. Also, leave two blocks overhanging the pit.

This trap is, naturally, geared towards Zombies. Their AI will tell them to jump and escape, but thanks to the fourth block jut, they'll become confused, turn, and try the other side of the pit.
Alternatively, you can make the pit four blocks deep and have a one block jut.
If you have the Mechanic, you can place Active Stone Blocks on the hole to create a bridge. Make a Lever somewhere else.

, Just simply dig a hole, place over it a few Active Stone Blocks, and wait for any players or enemies to come through. When you see them, flip a Switch to make the Active Stone Blocks Inactive and kill them.

For an extra touch, you can put Lava in the hole.

, This is done by building a 9×10 room in front of your wall. On the lower three blocks of each end, place a door. Then, split the structure into two rooms with a dividing wall. Place in each room a series of ascending Wood Platforms.

This trap is geared towards Slimes. Since Slimes constantly hop, they will hop into the room and continue hopping, up the platforms. They cannot, however, hop down, and will be stuck at the top of the room.

, Enemies will fall in and die.

If you make the Lava pit shallow enough, you can collect the drops of your fallen foes.

, These are like Active Stone Blocks, but can blend in with their surroundings. Use these as trapdoors., Now, you can teleport between the two places.,,,

Make sure it's low enough that you can reach it, high enough so other players can't reach it, but low enough that Harpies and Wyverns won't spawn around it.
You can also convert a Floating Island to your personal base.

, This may be a bit risky, as you are in danger of Sharks and Orcas and drowning. However, it's ideal for trapping the Angler if he wanders around underwater., These can only be mined by the Picksaw, and are the strongest block in the game., Mark them and store different items in each., This will kill flying enemies., This is to prevent casualties.,, Fill them with something useless or commonly found, like Dirt or Wood. Even leave them empty! Hide your chest of real valuables somewhere else.

For example, you could hide it in a tiny structure barely visible on the map, like in a 4x4 room of Lihzahrd Brick.

Have a look at your options.,
Mine.,
Craft Spears.,
Explore the possibility of using a Flail.",How to Beat the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria1," If you have discovered the Crimson/Corruption, you can craft an Ebonwood/Crimsonwood Sword.
, A Copper (or Tin) sword simply will not do. Look for Gold (Or platinum), or at least make a Silver (or Tungsten) sword., As the Eye of Cthulhu floats in the air, unless you want to be constantly jumping, a Spear is a good choice. Strong Spears can do, but there are better beginner Spears. Explore the ocean (Trident), break Crimson Hearts (Rotted Fork), and find them in surface chests., The Flail technically falls into the category of Ranged, but can do as Melee. Either craft the Meatball (the Crimson flail) or break Shadow Orbs to get the Ball 'o Hurt (Corruption flail)."

Gather some weapons.,
Wait until night comes.,
Make your way to the dungeon.,
Attack the boss.,
Collect your reward.",How to Beat Skeletron in Terraria," Before you beat Skeletron be sure that you are at least a week old and know how to get around in the game and can easily survive the night. This will ensure that you are ready to defeat the Skeletron. You'll need a few weapons, good armour and some mana/health potions. A list can be seen below:


A set of armour. This includes the helmet, breast plate and boots. Try to have a better level of armour than wood armour to ensure that you last longer whilst fighting Skeletron.
Health potion. Keep at least 5 health potions so when your health becomes low you can boost it back up again. Hit the H key to level up quickly when fighting the boss.
Mana potion. Just like your health potions, keep at least 5 of these and type the M key to level up your mana quickly. Mana is used for magic whilst health is used for your hearts.
Bombs. Have at least 5 of these to chuck at the Skeletron. These take a fairly big impact and can be found in chests and vases around the world.
Sword. Don't just use a weak, wooden sword. Try finding at least a zombie arm (sword) which will be dropped from zombies. Zombies spawn during the night and are fairly easy to defeat.
Rocket boots. This is optional for you might not be able to find these depending on how experienced you are. You can purchase these with gold coins from the Goblin once you have found him underground in the caverns.;
, To tell when night comes you can find/buy yourself a watch or listen to the music which will change as it turns from day to night. Make your way to the dungeon (either on your left or right, opposite the jungle) a few hours in game time before night comes so that you have more time to defeat the Skeletron.

, A few hours (game-time) before the world turns into night, make your way over to the dungeon which should be located to your left or right (opposite the jungle). In the entrance door you should find an old man (The Clothier). Talk to him and choose to curse him which will summon Skeletron. Don't forget to take some Ironskin potion if you have some!

, Throw bombs at the Skeletron which should take in some damage. Try to aim for Skeletron's arms as these create the most damage. Use your sword to attack the arms without running into them (or the head). Keep on backing up and moving so the Skeletron misses you when it attacks. When the head spins, try your hardest to avoid it as it does the most damage when spinning and it takes in the least damage from you too.


Bombs can damage you along with Skeletron so be sure to avoid them when they are thrown

, After finishing the boss fight, you will have some small rewards such as health/mana, money, a trophy (depending on your version), etc. After that, make your way back to your safe home. You have now defeated Skeletron!

Get the Starfury.,
Explore the Dungeon.,
Break Shadow Orbs.,
Although this might be a bit much, you can beat Queen Bee in the Underground Jungle.,
Explore Hell.,
Beat Skeletron.,
Find gems and ores underground.",How to Beat the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria2," The best way to beat him will be by getting shadow/ Crimson armour (the later preferably) and get a Starfury using water bolts to find a floating island, This will mean you can hit him easily from the sky and very powerfully with the sword which is a mid-late game pre hardmode weapon. With this set-up, it is very difficult to lose

, If you've already beaten Skeletron, than you can find many beginning Magic weapons.

, This causes Meteorites to land. Out of Meteors, you can craft the Space Gun, which is an excellent Magic/Ranged., She drops the Bee Gun, which can hurt badly, especially since it shoots bees that hover around the enemy, doing continuous damage.

, This is a step only for intermediate players. In Hell, you can find Demon Scythes, Crystal Shards, and Flamelashes.

, He sometimes drops the Book of Skulls, which is an excellent magic weapon for those brave and strong enough to take on Skeletron.

, You can use an ore and it's respective gem to make gem staves, which can be very effective, and help with beating Queen Bee, if you want to do that.

Collect loot from surface chests.,
Get the Arms Dealer.,
As mentioned above, craft Space Guns out of Meteorite.,
Break Shadow Orbs.,
Break Crimson Hearts.",How to Beat the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria3," Blowguns, Bows, Boomerangs, and all that good stuff can be found as typical forest loot., Although this step is more for intermediate players, the Arms Dealer sells the Flintlock Pistol, which is a very useful choice for intermediate players. If you have a bunch of money (35 Gold coins to be exact), you can purchase the Minishark, but this could be a bit much for defeating the Eye of Cthulhu., This is more of a magic weapon, but if you're willing to sacrifice a bit of mana, this is a great choice., Occasionally, they drop the Musket, which is another excellent choice for players willing to deal a bit more power into their hits., Every time the first Crimson Heart is broken in a world, it has a 100% chance of dropping the Undertaker, a small little pistol similar to the Flintlock."
"
Try to stay out from under it, if the enemy is above you.,
If you are out from under it and it charges you diagonally, either:


Jump over the assailant
Sidestep it
Take the hit (not recommended)
If the enemy suffers knock-back, hit it with a broadsword.,
Jump.,
Hit smart projectiles with a broadsword.",How to Defeat Flying Enemies and Bosses in Terraria1," Flying enemies typically stay above you and try to charge you. Stay away from the underside and this will be obsolete. However, they are able to charge diagonally.;
, Short-swords are not advisable for this as they only go forward.

, This is usually a good option. Charges and projectiles can be avoided by jumping (Pressing the space bar, but you know that already.) which propels you upward, over the enemy/launched attack.(This also works for ground enemies, but be aware that most walking enemies/slimes jump too.)

, The smart projectiles are the ones that follow you, such as Servants of Cthulhu or Servants of Ocram, etc. Broadsword are used against them, helping you to not take as many hits. (Sometimes the smart projectiles drop hearts, they can be exploited for easy healing.)

"
"
Stay ahead of them, and when you're ready to attack, use a broadsword.,
Tackle Slimes differently.,
If in doubt, use ranged weapons.",How to Defeat Flying Enemies and Bosses in Terraria2," If it gets in close, and you're about to get hit, jump over them. Preferably, use a Cloud in a Bottle for this, as they can jump like you.

, Their AI goes as follows: ""Hops in one direction, slides on slopes, floats in water, follows player, damages player."" Usually, striking them with a broadsword a few times is enough to eliminate them. The King Slime is exempt to this, as he is a mini-boss.

, They can be used extremely well for all enemies. You can strike from a distance and not be hurt.

Find a Moldorm.,
Dodge its attacks.,
Strike its tail.,
Find a Moldorm.,
Dodge its attack.,
Attack Moldorms while in its in mid-air.,
Force Moldorms out of the sand.",How to Kill the Moldorm in the Legend of Zelda," These monsters can be found on the specific locations of the following game versions of The Legend of Zelda:


The Legend of Zelda – Can be found in any dungeons within the game.
A Link to the Past – Inside the boss room of “Tower of Hera,” the third level of the game.
Four Swords – Inside the boss room of “Tail Cave,” the first level of the game.
The Wind Waker – After defeating the “Puppet Ganon” boss inside the Tower of Ganon. It will transform into a Moldorm.
The Minish Cap – Can be found anywhere inside the “Fortress of Wind” level.
Phantom Hourglass – Can be found anywhere inside the “Temple of Courage” level.
Skyward Sword – Can be found in any dungeons within the game.
A Link Between Worlds – Inside the boss room of Tower of Hera, just like in a Link to the Past version.

, Moldorms do not have any special techniques. Once these creatures spot you, they will move linearly towards you and try to ram your character. Just make a short sidestep off the monster’s path to avoid its attack.

, To kill Moldorms, all you need to do is to strike its tail three times with your sword. After you’ve dodged its attack, you should eventually end up behind the monster, giving you full access to its defenseless tail. Press the “Attack” button on your controller quickly to slash at the tail.


One other weapon you could use to kill Moldorms aside from your sword is your bow and arrow. After dodging its ram attack, or standing from a safe distance, aim your bow at its tail and fire an arrow at it. Unlike your sword, it only takes one shot of an arrow to the tail to kill Moldorms.

, Only in the Twilight Princess version do Moldorms take a different approach to kill. These creatures can be found swimming in the sands of the Gerudo Desert. Once you get in the desert, you’ll see these creatures roaming around the area, just like how sharks move around the surface of the water.;
, Moldorms do not have any special techniques in this version either. Once these creatures spot you, they will slither through the sand towards you. Once they’re close enough, they’ll jump out of the sand and dive at you. Just make a short sidestep off the monster’s path to avoid its attack.

, You can’t kill these monsters while they are in the sands. That’s why as these monsters jump out of the sand to attack you, they’ll be exposing their defenseless bodies. Press the “Attack” button on your controller quickly to slash at the Moldorm’s body while it’s in mid-air. It takes three hits of your sword to the tail before a Moldorm can be killed.


Just like in other versions of the game, one other weapon you can use to kill Moldorms is your bow and arrow. While the worm is in mid-air, shoot an arrow at its body to kill it. Unlike your sword, it only takes one shot of an arrow to the body to kill Moldorms.

, If the monster won’t come out of the sand to attack you, you can use your Clawshot (which you will acquire before you even reach Gerudo Desert) to draw out the monster by force.


Simply aim your Clawshot on the moving part of the sand where the worm is swimming and press the Action button on your controller to launch it. The Clawshot will pull the Moldorm out of the sand and it will flop on the ground like a fish out of water. Use your sword or bow and arrow just like in step 3 to kill it while it’s jumping around the ground.

Have your weapons ready.,
Deflect their attacks.,
Dodge their attacks if you don’t have a shield.,
Counterattack.",How to Kill Moblins in the Legend of Zelda," Unsheathe your sword and have your shield ready by your side. Moblins only have average speed, but having your main character ready for offense is still helpful.
, Moblins are commonly equipped with a bow and arrow, a sword, or a spear. They will attack you once you come in their line of sight. To deflect their attacks, all you need to do is to use your shield. That’s it. Their arrows or sword/spear attacks will fall on your shield, leaving you unharmed.

Moblins don’t use any special type of sword or spear attacks, just hack and slash, so it’s very easy to deflect.

, If you don’t have a shield yet (you can encounter Moblins even at the very start of the game before some of the items you need, like your shield, are given to you), you can avoid their attacks by simply jumping out of their way.

Once you see that the Moblin is about to slash you or shoot an arrow at you, simply sidestep to your left or right side, and you’ll be able to dodge their attacks easily.

, After attacking, Moblins will drop their guards and will need a few seconds to get back to position; this is your time to do a counterattack. Using your sword, hack away at the unguarded Moblin to kill it."

Wait for Stalfos to strike.,
Dodge.,
Retaliate.",How to Kill Stalfos in the Legend of Zelda," Have your shield ready on one of your controller’s Action buttons. Press the “Start” button on the controller of whatever Nintendo console you’re using to open its menu.


Using the Arrow buttons, select the shield from the list of items you have and press the Action button you want to assign it to, like X or Y (Wii), or A or B (Game Boy).
Press the “Start” button once more to go back to the gameplay.;
, Stalfos won’t immediately attack you. It will circle around you and wait for an opportunity to strike. Just stay where you are and keep your eyes on the enemy. Make sure to watch its every move and be aware when it’s about to strike.

, Right at the moment Stalfos is about to strike you with its sword, press the Action button on your controller and use the shield to accept the full blow of Stalfos’ attack. This will send the enemy stepping back a couple of steps from where you are, losing its balance and dropping its guard.


Timing is the key to deflecting Stalfo’s strike, which is not very hard to do since this enemy’s moves are pretty much very predictable.

, Once you've hold off Stalfos’ strike, it’s time to fight back. Using your sword, quickly slash at the enemy while it’s still out of balance. Once you've damage Stalfos, it will quickly return back to its fighting stance.

, Ready your shield while Stalfos circles around you. This will tempt you to move away too, which you shouldn't do since it will only make Stalfos chase you instead of attacking you. Stay right where you are and ready your sword.

, Stalfos will suddenly stop moving, crouch, and get into a jumping position. This is your queue to prepare. Wait for it to leap into the air before you make a move.

, Once Stalfos leaps into the air, quickly press any of the directional arrow buttons on the controller to immediately jump out of the way. If you’ve dodged the attack on time, Stalfos will only hit the ground, making the sword stuck and rendering it defenseless.


Just like deflecting a hack-and-slash attack, timing is also the key to successfully carrying out this counterattack.

, While the enemy is trying to pull its sword out of the ground, quickly strike it with your sword. Once you've inflicted damage, Stalfos will quickly return back to its fighting stance.

Four Swords – Inside Mini Boss Rooms of various dungeons.
Twilight Princess – “Temple of Time” level.;
, The moment you enter the Boss Room, Gohma will begin attacking you using its two front legs. Avoid this attack by simply running around the Boss Room.

, After three or more consecutive claw leg attacks, the giant spider will then blow a breath of fire at you. This fire breath will last around 3 seconds and will trail you wherever you go. Keep running around the room like what you’ve been doing in step 2 until the fire breath stops to avoid getting damaged.

, After attacking you with its fire breath, it will pause for at least three seconds and letting its guard down. Quickly turn around and shoot at the spider’s singular eye using your bow and arrow.


After damaging its eye, Gohma will resume attacking you again. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you get the chance to shoot its eye again. Keep doing this for at least five times or more until you defeat the monster.

Use long-range weapons.",How to Kill Goriyas in the Legend of Zelda1," In this version, Goriyas appear exclusively inside dungeons. They are the dungeon counterpart of Moblins of the Overworld. Equip yourself with a shield to protect you from boomerangs the Goriyas may fling at you.;
, Once you see a Goriya, slowly approach it with your shield in front of you. These monsters just randomly throw boomerangs in different directions instead of aiming one at you so getting closer to them won’t be too hard.

, Once you get close enough, hack at the Goriya with your sword to kill it.


There are two types of Goriyas in this version, with their toughness as the only difference. The first one is the red Goriya, which takes around one slash to kill; while the other one is the blue Goriya, which takes about two or three slashes of your sword to defeat.

, If you don’t want to get close to a Goriya to kill it, you can use long-range weapons to defeat them.


Equip your bow and arrow, and shoot at the direction where the Goriya is walking. A single arrow can kill a red Goriya while blue ones may take up to three.
Throw a bomb close to where a Goriya is and wait for it to detonate. A bomb can kill a red Goriya in one explosion while blue ones can take up to two.

, Blade Traps can only attack on one direction, which is why it’s commonly found near blocking doors or open passages. But it’s quite hard to tell which way a Blade Trap will move, so you need to approach it very slowly with your shield raised up.

, Once you come in range of its attack, the Blade Trap will swiftly attack. The attack is so quick that jumping out of its way is very hard, unless you can predict when the strike will come. If you have your shield raised, you should be spared from the damage the Blade Traps can deal.

, After the Blade Trap attacks, it will slowly go back to its original place in the room, which takes a considerable length of time. This gives you an opening to move across the room and pass the Blade Traps without getting hurt.

Ignore the boomerangs.,

Kill the Goriya.",How to Kill Goriyas in the Legend of Zelda2," In this game, Goriyas can throw boomerangs that can arch above your hero’s head, besides the usual one that goes straight at you. It’s quite hard to predict whether the boomerang is going to go over your head or straight to your character, so trying to dodge it would only make killing the Goriya harder.

, As soon as you see a Goriya, quickly make your way toward it, disregarding the boomerang even if it damages you.

, Once you get close enough, press the Action button on your controller to quickly hack at the monster (you only have your sword). Keep slashing at the Goriya until it’s destroyed. If you attack swiftly, you could slay the monster even before its boomerang comes back.


It takes around two slashes to defeat a Goriya in this game.

Stop and study the area.,
Plan your movements.,
Shoot them with your arrows.",How to Kill Goriyas in the Legend of Zelda3," Goriyas in this game are different from other versions. Instead of randomly walking or throwing boomerangs at you, there are two types of Goriyas that reflect the movements of your character: a green Goriya and a red one. Once you encounter a Goriya, stop moving and study the environment your character is at.

, Goriyas will do the opposite of your movement—that is, if you go one direction (left, right, up, or down), they go the other way, respectively. Move around the floor so that the Goriyas stops in your line of sight.

, Once the Goriyas are in your line of sight, equip your bow and shoot an arrow at the monster to kill it.


Green Goriyas do not attack, but red Goriyas will throw a fireball at you once you get into its line of sight. Swiftly shoot an arrow at the red monster once it falls into your line to quickly kill it before it can fire at you.
If you manage to get close enough with a Goriya, you can just use your sword to kill the monster.

Once you get inside the mini boss room, take out your sword and get ready to attack.


You could use other weapons, but the sword is the most effective weapon against this mini boss.

, The Goriya Brothers will pass a boomerang between them. They work together so you only need to kill one of them to defeat the two.

, Forget the boomerang they pass around. It cannot be deflected by your shield. Just rush towards one of the two, and tap the Attack button as fast as you can to continuously slash at the monster and kill it swiftly. Once you kill one of the Goriyas, the other will be automatically destroyed."

These monsters will randomly drop bombs. Bombs, along with Rupees and arrows, are the most commonly dropped items by weak enemies.

, Another way to get free bombs is by opening the treasure chests you’ll find inside dungeons. Treasure chest items are randomly placed inside, but there’s a higher chance that you’ll get bombs instead of other items, like arrows.

, Legend of Zelda is well known for putting a lot jars all throughout the gaming world of every version. These jars can be broken into pieces and drop random items, like bombs. Just like with killing low-level monsters, bombs are one of the items that are commonly dropped when you break jars.

Find a Tektite.,
Anticipate its movement.,
Dodge its attack.,
Counterattack.",How to Defeat the Tektite in the Legend of Zelda1," Tektites are mainly found on forests or mountain regions. They can be seen roaming around these places freely. Once you find a Tektite, you don’t need to approach it, since it will slowly come closer to you once it spots you.;
, Tektites jump in order to move around. It’s also the monster’s attack method. As it comes closer, carefully observe where the Tektite lands as it approaches you, to anticipate where the monster will attack you from.

, Tektites attack by jumping up in the air and slamming its body onto your character. Dodging the monster’s attack is actually pretty easy; once it’s right beside you, it will begin to take one final leap. As the Tektite goes up in the air, quickly jump out of where you’re standing to avoid its body slam.

, After it lands, it will take at least two seconds before it leaps into the air again and try to slam at you one more time. You can use this time to slash the monster with your sword. It takes around two to three slashes of your sword to defeat a Tektite.

"

Find a Tektite.,
Equip your long-range weapons.,
Defeat the Tektite.",How to Defeat the Tektite in the Legend of Zelda2," Tektites are mostly found on forests or mountain regions. They can be seen roaming around these places freely. Once you find a Tektite, you don’t need to approach it, since it will slowly come closer to you once it spots you.

, Press the “Pause” button on your game controller to open in the game menu. Using the directional arrow keys, look for long-range weapons, like the bow and arrow, boomerang, and bombs from your item list, and press the Action button on your game console controller where you want to assign the item. This will equip the item on that particular Action button. Press the “Pause” button once more to go back to the game.


The same controller buttons can be used to equip items on any Nintendo console.

, Aim your long-range weapon at the Tektite from a safe distance, and fire at the monster to kill it before it even comes close to you. It takes around two arrows, one strike of the boomerang, or one bomb to kill a Tektite.

"
"
Draw your sword.,
Walk slowly towards the creature.,
Avoid its attack.,
Wait for it to land.,
Defeat the Peahat.",How to Defeat Peahats in the Legend of Zelda," Once you spot a Peahat, draw out your sword and prepare to fight.


You can use other weapons like your bow and arrow, bombs, or boomerangs, but these will not be very ideal since these monsters move around too much.;
, Make sure that you don‘t make any sudden moves. If you’re lucky, you can simply pass by safely. On the other hand, if you get a couple of feet too close, the Peahat’s petal will start rotating and fly into the air.

, While in flight, it will simply take a dodge straight at you and damage you with its spinning petals. Simple move out of the way or use your shield to protect yourself and deflect its attack.

, Don’t bother attacking the Peahat while it’s in midair as its rotating petals act as a shield against sword attacks. Once it’s through with its attack sequence, the creature will eventually land again. When it does, you can now approach and get close to it.

, Using your sword, slash at its body as many times as you could. While on land, it won’t have any defense and will receive all your blows directly. It takes two to three strikes before you can defeat a Peahat.

"
"
Ready your shield.,
Block Octoroks’ projectiles.,
Slowly walk towards the Octorok.",How to Defeat Octoroks in the Legend of Zelda1," Octoroks can sometimes lie in plain sight or hide behind bushes and pop out of the water- that’s why having your shield ready at all times is a good measure. Equip your shield on one of your controller’s Action button as you walk along watery or bushy parts of the map so you can easily take it out under short notice.;
, Once you come within a few feet of the monster, it will immediately start shooting rocks at you. Using your shield, cover yourself and deflect the enemy’s projectile attacks.

, While covering yourself with your shield, slowly step towards the monster. Once it’s within the range of your sword, quickly press the Action button where your offensive weapon is equipped to take a blow or shot at the monster.


Octoroks have very low life points and can easily be killed with just one or two blows of your sword.

"
"
Have your bow and arrow ready.,
Dodge Octoroks’ projectiles.,
Shoot the Octorok.",How to Defeat Octoroks in the Legend of Zelda2," Once you see an Octorok, find a safe spot a great distance away from where the monster is.

, If you come within a few feet of the monster, it will immediately start shooting rocks at you. Your distance from the monster though should give ample time to react and sidestep out of the trajectory of the Octorok’s projectiles.

, Press and hold the Action button where you currently have the bow and arrow equipped. Adjust your aim using the control keys on your controller, and release the Action button to shoot the monster. It takes only one or two arrows to defeat an Octorok.

"
"
Have your bombs ready.,
Adjust your aim.,
Throw the bomb.",How to Defeat Octoroks in the Legend of Zelda3," Once you see an Octorok, press the Action button on your controller where the bomb is equipped to take out a bomb.

, If the Octorok you found is stationary, then there’s no need to adjust your aim. But if it’s walking around, you have anticipate its course of direction so you can throw the bomb exactly where the monster will go.

, Press the Action button again to throw one directly at the Octorok. Wait for a few seconds until the bomb goes off near the monster, killing it.

"
"
Unlock the level.,
Find the treasure.,
Fight the mini boss.,
Find the Boss Key.,
Defeat the boss.",How to End a Level in the Legend of Zelda," The only way you can proceed to the next level or dungeon in the game is by completing the one that precedes it. Paths will be blocked or enemies that are impossible to defeat will be standing in your way, stopping you from going to the next level without finishing the one that comes before it.


On the other hand, if you’ve just started the game, the first level will not be locked and can easily be accessed because there’s no other level that precedes it.;
, The first thing you need to do every time you start a level is to find the treasure inside. Each dungeon or level keep treasures, like equipment or consumable items that you’ll need in order to complete that very same level, inside treasure boxes. These treasures can be found a few rooms from the entrance of the dungeons, so they’re not very difficult to retrieve.

, After finding the dungeon treasure, the next thing you need to do is fight the mini boss. A mini boss is slightly stronger than a generic minion but is weaker than a Boss type enemy. A mini boss guards its own room, usually a few paces away from where you found the dungeon treasure. Mini bosses can usually be killed with just four to five strikes of your sword or whatever weapon required to defeat it.

, Once you’ve killed the mini boss, it’s time to face the dungeon’s final boss. But unlike the mini boss’s room, the Dungeon Boss’s room is locked and can only be unlocked by the Boss Key—a large oddly shaped key. The key usually lies in rooms that you’ll venture right after you’ve killed the mini boss. Check for treasure boxes that you’ll find in these places to get the Boss Key.

, The Dungeon Boss’s room is very easy to find since its door is the largest one in the level, is covered with intricate designs, and is placed deeper inside the dungeon. Use the Boss Key to open the room and fight the Dungeon Boss. Unlike the mini boss, which can be defeated by a few strikes of your sword, the Dungeon Boss is very tough and, usually, can only be defeated using the equipment or item treasure you found inside the same dungeon. Each dungeon boss is unique and requires a specific method to kill.


After killing the Dungeon Boss, a portal will appear that leads back to the outside world. Stepping inside the portal will teleport you back to the Overworld, ending the level.

Find a Razor Fang in Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby.",How to Evolve Gligar," Gligar's evolution, Gliscor, was introduced in the Generation IV versions of Pokémon (Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum), even though Gligar was introduced in Generation II. If you're playing Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, or LeafGreen, you'll need to transfer Gligar to a Generation IV game in order to evolve it.


You can transfer from Generation III to Generation IV, but you can't transfer from Generation I or II to Generation III. This means that a Gligar from Gold, Silver, or Crystal cannot be evolved into Gliscor, because it cannot be transferred to a version that supports it.
To transfer from Generation III to Generation IV, you'll need to have received the National Pokedex in your Generation III game. Insert the GBA cartridge in your DS and select ""Migrate"" from the main menu of your Generation IV game. Select Gligar and five other Pokémon you want to migrate. In your Generation IV game, visit the Pal Park on Route 221 to catch your migrated Gligar.;

, Your Gligar must be holding this item in order to evolve.


The Razor Fang can cause your opponent to Flinch during battle, which makes it a fairly useful item regardless.

Changing your system's time in later games will prevent you from being able to evolve Gligar at night for 24 hours. You can safely change your system time while playing Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum to fast-forward to Nighttime.

, It doesn't matter what level Gligar is, it just needs to level up at night while holding the Razor Fang. It will attempt to evolve as soon as it levels up.


You can level up by fighting a wild Pokémon or a trainer, or by using a Rare Candy.

, Fight in the Battle Tower after defeating the Elite Four to earn Battle Points (BP). You can spend 48 BP to purchase a Razor Claw. In Platinum, you can find a Razor Fang in the lower-left corner of Route 225, but you'll need Rock Climb to reach it. You can also find one hidden in the southern tall grass on Route 214, but this is Platinum-only as well.

In HeartGold and SoulSilver, you can only get a Razor Fang from the Battle Frontier.

, There are three ways to get a Razor Fang in Black or White:

You can find a Razor Claw on Route 13 on the cliff to the south of Artist Zach. Route 13 becomes available after completing the story.
You can find a Razor Claw at the Abundant Shrine, southwest of the trainer named Maki.
You can earn a Razor Fang at the Battle Subway by winning 48 BP.

, Like their predecessors, there are three ways to get a Razor Fang in Black 2 and White 2:

Bring a Pokémon that knows Surf and Waterfall, and travel to Route 11. You'll find the Razor Fang to the right of Thalia.
Earn 8 BP at the Pokémon World Tournament to get a Razor Fang. The Pokémon World Tournament is in Driftveil. This may be the easiest way to get a Razor Fang in the game.
You can also get a Razor Fang for 8 BP at the Battle Subway as well, which becomes available later than the Pokémon World Tournament.

, You can't find a Razor Fang in the world in these game. They'll need to be won:

A Razor Fang costs 48 BP from the Battle Maison, available after beating the game.
You can win a Razor Claw by playing the Balloon Popping game at the PokeMileage Club. The game costs 100 Miles, which are earned by walking in the game and trading with other players. You'll need to play the Level 3 version of the game to get a chance at the Razor Claw.

, There are a couple of different ways to get a Razor Fang in the newest Pokémon games:

The Battle Maison at the Battle Resort stocks Razor Fangs for 48 BP.
Nearly every Mirage Island will have a Razor Fang on it, making this the easiest way to get one.
Like X and Y, you can win one at the PokeMileage Club for playing the Level 3 Balloon Popping game.

Know what evolutions are possible.,
Find and catch an Eevee.,
Name your Eevee according to your preferred evolution.,
Give your Eevee 25 candy.",How to Evolve Eevee Into All Its Evolutions1," As of May 16th, 2017, the only Pokémon available in Pokémon GO those from the 1st and 2nd generation- the original Pokémon from Red, Blue, Green, gold and silver. This means that while Flareon, Vaporeon, Jolteon, Umbreon and Espeon are available, those from later generations (Sylveon, Leafeon and Glaceon) are not available yet. Stay tuned for the release of these Pokémon!;
, Eevee is a relatively common Normal-type Pokémon, so it can be found quite easily in suburbs or town centers. You are less likely to find Eevee in areas that contain lots of Bug or Water Pokémon, such as forests or near water.When you find Eevee, whip out that PokéBall and catch it.

, In Pokémon GO, Eevee's role serves as an homage to the Eevee Brothers from the original Pokémon anime. The names of the Eevee Brothers were Sparky, Rainer, and Pyro, and they owned a Jolteon, Vaporeon, and Flareon, respectively. Also, if you want, name the Eevee Tamao for an Umbreon, and name the Eevee Sakura for an Espeon. So, name your Eevee as follows depending on how you would like it to evolve:Tap into your Pokémon and select the Eevee you want to evolve. To the right of the name there is a light gray pencil icon. Press that icon, type the name you want, and hit OK.
Sparky - Eevee will evolve into Jolteon
Rainer - Eevee will evolve into Vaporeon
Pyro - Eevee will evolve into Flareon
Tamao - Eevee will evolve into an Umbreon
Sakura - Eevee will evolve into an Espeon

, Go to your Pokémon. Select the Eevee you want to evolve and hit the ""Evolve"" button. Once you do, it will evolve depending on the name you gave it upon catching it!


All Pokémon all have their own candy and will only respond to that candy. You can see how much candy you have when you tap into that Pokémon's profile.
There are 3 ways you can get candy: by catching that Pokémon, by trading excess of the same Pokémon to Professor Willow, and by hatching eggs."
"
Before you start, you'll need to find an Eevee.",How to Evolve Eevee Into All Its Evolutions2," Depending on the game, the locations and situations on finding an Eevee is different.

In Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum, the first Eevee is given as gift from Bebe in Hearthome City. The second is found by going to the Trophy Garden and talking to Mr.Backlot (only some days). Note that you may need the National Pokédex to get one.
In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Eevees can be found on Route 115 as hidden pokemon.

"
"
Use a Fire Stone on Eevee to evolve Flareon.,
Use a Water Stone on Eevee to evolve Vaporeon.,
Use a Thunder Stone on Eevee to evolve Jolteon.",How to Evolve Eevee Into All Its Evolutions3," Flareon, Vaporeon, and Jolteon are all evolved from Eevee in similar ways - by using special elemental ""stone"" items. To evolve a Flareon, for instance, use a Fire stone on it.


Fire stones can be found at the Fuego Ironworks in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum. They are also very common in the Underground.
Flareon is a good Pokémon if you want a high attack level. In fact, it has the highest Attack of all Fire Types, tied with Ho-Oh. It also has Flash Fire, an ability which powers up Fire moves.

, Vaporeon is evolved in the same way as Flareon, only with a Water Stone rather than a Fire Stone.


Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum: Only one Water Stone can be found on Route 213; surf is needed to get this stone. In the Underground, unlike the Fire Stone, the Water Stone is very rare and very difficult to find. You can find one water stone in Solaceon Ruins hidden in a rock.
Like many Water-Types, Vaporeon's highest stat is its HP. It also has a rather high Special Attack. Its ability is Water Absorb, which heals it when hit with Water-Type moves.

, Finally, Jolteon is evolved by using a Thunder Stone on an Eevee.


Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum: Thunder Stones can be found at Sunyshore City (where it is hidden very well) and in the Underground, where they are almost as common as Fire Stones.
Jolteon's highest stat is its extraordinary speed. Its ability is Volt Absorb, which, like Water Absorb, heals it when hit by Electric-Type moves.

Raise Eevee's friendship.,
Level up your Eevee during the day.,
In Pokémon XD level up your Eevee while you have the Sun Shard.",How to Evolve Eevee Into All Its Evolutions4," Espeon evolves from an Eevee who levels up during the day with a high friendship rating. This means it can take several days to evolve into Espeon. To raise your Eevee's friendship, give it massages (At Veilstone City or Resort Area) and get the Happiness Checker App. If, when you touch its icon, two big hearts appear, you're ready!

, Get into battles with your Eevee in the day or morning until it levels up. If its friendship is high enough, it should evolve into Espeon.

, A man in Gateon Port's Machine Parts Shop gives the player a choice between several different items, including the Sun Shard. If you choose the Sun Shard and level up your Eevee, it will evolve into Espeon.


Espeon's highest stats are its Special stats, and its ability, Synchronize, passes on Burns, Poison, or Paralyzed status to the Pokémon that gave it a Burn, Poison or Paralysis.

"
"
Raise your Eevee's friendship and level it up at night.,
In Pokémon XD, level Eevee up while you have the Moon Shard.",How to Evolve Eevee Into All Its Evolutions5," Like Espeon, Umbreon evolves from an Eevee with a high friendship level. The key difference is that Umbreon only evolves at night. Follow the instructions above on how to raise your Eevee's friendship level.

, Simply choose the Moon Shard from the man in Gateon Port's Machine Parts Shop, rather than the Sun Shard. Level your Eevee up and you should get an Umbreon!


Umbreon's highest stats are its Defense stats (both). Umbreon is a good Pokémon for giving status conditions, especially with its ability Synchronize, explained above in the Espeon section. Umbreon is hands-down one of the best Shiny Pokémon ever had.

"
Find a Moss Rock or Mossy Rock.,
Level up your Eevee in the same area as the Moss Rock.",How to Evolve Eevee Into All Its Evolutions6," Leafeon is not a difficult Pokémon to evolve. In fact, you can capture Eevee and evolve it right away just with one level up. All you must do is ensure that you level the Eevee up in the same area as a Moss Rock, of which there are several in the game. Below are a list of locations:


Sinnoh: In the Eterna Forest
Unova: In the Pinwheel Forest
Kalos: In the Winding Woods
Hoenn: In the Petalburg Woods
Alola: In the Lush Jungle

"
"
Find an Ice Rock.,
Level up your Eevee near the Ice Rock.",How to Evolve Eevee Into All Its Evolutions7," Like Leafeon, you can evolve Glaceon right away after capturing an Eevee. However, doing so requires an Ice Rock, of which there are only a few in the game. Go to one of the areas listed below where ice rocks are located:


Sinnoh: Route 217
Unova: A room on the bottom floor of the basement of Twist Mountain
Kalos: Inside the Frost Cavern in Kalos. (You must have surf)
Hoenn: On the lowest floor in Shoal Cave, however only when the tide is low.
Alola: Inside the cave in Mount Lanakila

, Get into battles in the same area as an ice rock and gain experience for your Eevee. You don't have to be right next to the Ice Rock - you can level-it up anywhere within the areas listed above (note that the Twist Mountain Ice Rock requires you to be in the same room as it). When your Eevee gains a level, it should evolve into a Glaceon!


Glaceon's highest stats are Defense and Special Attack, and its ability, Snow Cloak, makes it more evasive in Hailstorms.

"
"
Make sure Eevee has a Fairy-type move.,
Get your Eevee to two Pokémon Amie (X, Y, Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire) or Pokémon Refresh (Sun, Moon) Affection Hearts.,
Level up your Eevee.",How to Evolve Eevee Into All Its Evolutions8," Eevee will naturally evolve into Sylveon if certain important conditions are met. The first of these is that the Eevee must know at least one Fairy-type move. You can catch a wild Eevee with Baby-Doll Eyes (Level 19), or use the move tutor to relearn it.

, Using the care tool in your game, feed the Eevee and play with it until it gets two affection hearts. Your Eevee's current hearts can be seen when selecting another Pokémon to play with.

If you are playing Sun and Moon, using a Rainbow Poke Bean will guarantee the friendliness of your Eevee to go up 2 or even 3 affection hearts.







, Get into battles and use your Eevee until it gains a level. If both of the conditions above are met, it should evolve into a Sylveon!


Sylveon's highest stats are Special Defense and Special Attack. Its ability Cute Charm has a chance of infatuating opponents of the opposite gender if they use a contact move on it.

",How to Evolve Flabebe Into Floette and Florges," Flabebe can be found early, just after the 1st gym, to be specific. The color of her flower does not do anything, it is purely for cosmetics.;
, This should be done by before the 2nd gym. Using that, you will have evolved her into Floette. She does not learn any new moves upon evolution, though.

,


To find a Shiny Stone, you will have to wait until you have beat the Shalour City gym leader, Korrina. Soon after, Calem or Serena (depending on the gender chosen at the beginning of the game) will give you HM04 Surf. This is a tool you need to claim your Shiny Stone.

, Although this is optional, before finding it, you have to battle a Backpacker with a Linoone. After battling him, go into the Baa De Mer Ranch, and on a ledge in one corner, you have gained your coveted Shiny Stone!

Choose ""Register Friend Code.""
Type in your friend's username, press ""OK,"" then type in the code given by your friend.;

, 3 slots for trading will appear after you connect with your friend. This is where you can put the Pokémon that you wish to trade. Place your Gurdurr here and trade with your friend. Don't worry about what level you are on—when traded, your Gurdurr will evolve regardless of its level.

, If you have successfully traded Gurdurr with your friend's Pokémon, then your Gurdurr should have evolved to Conkeldurr. To get your new, improved Conkeldurr back, though, you need to trade with your friend again (this is the reason it's so important to trade with a person you can trust!).

, It will need to be holding the item to evolve.

, Electabuzz needs to be traded to evolve. Find someone that will trade your evolved Electivire back to your after it evolves. Electabuzz will evolve as soon as it is traded.


You can only trade with someone playing a game from the same Generation as you. In each of the Pokémon games, trading won't become available until after you complete a gym or two.
In Generation IV and V, trade using the Union Room in any Pokémon Center. You can also trade using the IR feature in Generation V. See this article for a guide on trading.In Generation VI, online and local trading is performed by using the Player Search System.
In Generation VII, online and local trading is performed by using the Festival Plaza.

, Your friend will have the Electivire in their party after the trade, so make sure they trade it back to you.


The Electirizer will disappear after Electabuzz evolves.


, You'll need to capture a wild Elekid which may be holding an Electabuzz. The major challenge here is that you'll need to have a Pokémon FireRed cartridge inserted into the DS in the second slot (This won't work on a DSi, 3DS, or 2DS). You'll also need to have completed your National Pokedex in your current game, but you don't have to have beaten the Elite 4. Once you have met all of these requirements, you'll have an 8% chance of finding an Elekid on Route 205 and at Valley Windworks.


, You can find an Electirizer in Valley Windworks by surfing off the right side of the bridge before Valley Windworks and then getting off by the windmill that you can't normally reach behind the fence. You may also find one being held by a wild Electabuzz, which you can find in the grass on Route 222.


, You can find an Electirizer on B1F in Cerulean Cave. You'll need the Surf, Flash, and Rock Climb abilities to be able to get to it. Go to the upper-right corner of B1F and you'll see a rocky wall you can climb down. Continue moving to the right and then use Rock Climb again to climb back up. The Electirizer will be on the ground nearby.


If you have the Pokewalker pedometer and got the Amity Field area during a special event, you can use the Pokewalker to get a chance at an Electirizer after 2550 steps.


, You can find an Electirizer in Black and White on Route 13. This Route only becomes available after you have beaten the main game. You'll need to bring along a Pokémon with the Cut ability. You can get to Route 13 from the north of Undella Town. Continue along the path until you get to the stairs down to the sand. Head straight down before the stairs and use Cut on the tree. Just a little further past the tree, you'll find the Electirizer.


, You can find an Electirizer from the Antique Shop on Join Avenue, but getting it is based on chance. The Electirizer is one of the possible rewards for the Small, Ordinary, Big, and Super Big Boxes as long as Agata the Pokémon Breeder or Jane the Parasol Lady is running the shop.


In White 2, you can find an Electirizer in the cafeteria on the Plasma Frigate. The frigate moves to different locations during the game, but will be permanently docked outside of the P2 Lab after you defeat Ghetsis.


, You can get an Electirizer by obtaining 32 BP from the Battle Maison. This facility only becomes available after beating the game. you'll be faced with tough battles and limits on the items and Pokémon that you can use. You normally get 1 BP per successful match, but streaks will grant bonuses.


You can also play the Balloon Popping game in the PokeMileage Club. You'll need to play Level 2, which costs 100 Poke Miles. These Miles are earned by walking in the game, trading with other players, and battling online. Pop 10 Balloons to tally your score and attempt to win the Electirizer.


, You'll need to capture a wild Elekid, which may be holding the Electirizer. You can only find wild Elekid on the Mirage Mountain that appears south of Route 129. You'll need to ride your Latios or Latias to the the mountain, as there is no other way to reach it. The mountain appears randomly on a daily basis.


The Mirage Mountain can appear in different locations. Elekid will only be on it when it is located south of Route 129.


, You can get an Electrizer from a man in the Huntail hut of Seafolk Village. He will also give you a Magmarizer (to evolve Magmar into Magmortar) along with the Electrizer.

You can also get one by capturing a wild Elekid or Electabuzz, which may be holding the Electrizer, or by buying one in the Battle Tree for 32 BP. Wild Elekid and Electabuzz appear on Route 12 and Blush Mountain. Wild Electabuzz can only be found by having a wild Elekid call one as an ally.

Get to the Boss Room.,
Avoid its attacks.,
Take out the four heads.,
Take out the four heads using bombs.",How to Defeat Manhandla in the Legend of Zelda1," Manhandla can be found on Level 3 of the Third Dungeon. After getting the key to the room, head to the third floor to get inside Manhandla’s boss room.;
, Once you enter the room, Manhandla will quickly start chasing after you and biting you with one of its four heads. Avoid the attacks by constantly moving around the room and anticipating where the monster will go to next.

, Slowly approach Manhandla and attack one of its four heads until it’s completely destroyed. Keep attacking Manhandla until all of its four heads are completely destroyed.


Manhandla will be defeated once all its heads are destroyed.

, Aside from your swords, Manhandla’s heads will also take damage from bombs. Simply throw bombs at the monster and it will damage the heads once it explodes.


This method is less efficient than using your sword because you’ll need a hefty amount of bombs for you to destroy the monster.

"
"
Find Manhandla.,
Avoid its attacks.,
Attack the heads with your boomerang.,
Attack its body.,
Continue attacking the heads and body.",How to Defeat Manhandla in the Legend of Zelda2," The monster can be found in the Valley of Seers and in Gerudo Desert. Manhandla can be found sitting in the middle section of the area and will start attacking you once you come closer.

, Manhandla will attack you with its four heads, biting and gnawing at you. Simply dodge these attacks by jumping out of the way of its heads.


During the battle, seeds will also be falling from the sky, which can damage your character. These seeds will only stop falling once you kill Manhandla. Just keep moving around to dodge the falling seeds. On the other hand, it would be best to just ignore these attacks and focus on killing the monster as quick as possible.

, Take out your boomerang and aim at one of Manhandla’s heads. The heads will turn green and retreat back into its body if you hit it. Keep attacking Manhandla until all of its four heads retracts inside the body.

, Once all four heads have retracted to its body, attack its body with your sword. After two to three strikes, all of its four heads will come out and resume its attack on you again.

, Manhandla can only be killed by attacking its body. Repeat attacking the head until they retreat, and then attacking the body a few times until Manhandla is defeated."

Identify Flaaffy’s strengths and weaknesses.,
Make Flaaffy reach level 30.,
Do not use a Thunderstone.",How to Evolve Flaaffy," As an Electric-type, Flaaffy can deal heavy damage against Water- and Flying-type Pokémon. It won’t have any trouble defeating Pokémon of these types even if their level is a bit higher.


On the other hand, Flaaffy is extremely weak against Electric, Grass, Dragon, or Ground-types. It will deal either a very low or no damage at all to these types and will take twice the normal damage if attacked by a Ground-type move.;
, Flaaffy evolves into its final evolution stage, Ampharos, when its level reaches 30. So until then, make Flaaffy earn experience points (XP) through Pokémon battles. To easily gain XP, you can do the following:


Fight wild Water and Flying-type Pokémon that have higher levels than Flaaffy. As mentioned, Flaaffy deals severe damage to these types, so it won’t have any trouble beating these kinds of opponent even if they’re a few levels higher. Pokémon with higher levels give off more XP when you defeat them.
Fight Pokémon trainers. Trained Pokémon gives more XP points when beaten compared to wild Pokémon.

, Even though it is an electric type, you can’t use a Thunderstone to forcibly evolve Flaaffy. It will naturally turn into Ampharos when it reaches the right level.


There are only a few Pokémon that can evolve using a Thunderstone and Flaaffy isn’t one of them.

Make Chingling hold a Soothe Bell.,
Feed Chingling Berries.,
Have Pokémon massages.,
Wait for nighttime.,
Level up Chingling.",How to Evolve Chingling," Soothe Bell is a kind of held item that gives off special effects to the Pokémon using it. Soothe Bells can be obtained from different places, depending on your game version:


Route 212 Mansion (Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum)
National Park (HeartGold and SoulSilver);
, Berries are items in the Pokémon world that when fed to a Pokémon, gives off special effects, like curing poison or restoring HP.


Berries like the Ginema Berry, a yellow cone-like berry found in the game, can raise a lowered stat, such as the Happiness.

, You can find a massage house in Veilstone City (Diamond and Pearl) right beside the Pokémon Gym. Go inside the house and talk to the blond girl inside the room. She will offer you a massage for your Pokémon. Simply select “Yes” and choose Chingling from the list.

, Once you max the Chingling’s Happiness level, wait for night to come. You have to wait until night because, based on the game mechanics, Chingling can only evolve during nighttime.


Starting from the fourth generation, the in-game time depends on your device’s clock or the real-world time. nighttime in the game starts at 8:00 PM and ends on 3:59 AM.
If you want the night to come faster, you can adjust your device’s system clock.

, When night arrives, go out and make Chingling level up. Go out and do Pokémon battles using Chingling until it levels up (at least once).


You can do any kind of Pokémon battle (either fighting trainers or wild Pokémon) as long as Chingling wins and gain XP.
Once Chingling levels up, it will evolve into its adult form: Chimecho.
If Chingling doesn’t evolve, make sure that its Happiness level is at least 220. You can max out the Happiness level (255) just to make sure.

Start EV training from birth.,
Use Pokémon with good stats to get Pokémon with good stats.,
Check your Pokémon’s IVs.",How to EV Train Your Pokémon1," EV training begins at birth. If you want perfect control over your Pokémon’s EVs, you’ll want to start from the minute they’re born, when their EVs are still a blank slate. Breed Pokémon in order to get eggs in your desired species that you can raise and train to be the best!;
, Since many of a Pokémon’s initial states (or IVs) are determined by their parents stats, you will want to use Pokémon with good stats in order to breed Pokémon with good stats. Just make sure that you understand how to breed Pokémon.

, Once you have a couple of newborn Pokémon, check their IVs using online tools. Google ""IV Calculator"" and input your Pokémon stats. The best IV for any one stat is 31, but IVs of 29 or 30 are also usable. Take the best out of several Pokémon or stop when you have one with really good stats.

"
"
Pick your battles carefully.,
Switch Pokémon if you need to.,
Fight the right Pokémon.",How to EV Train Your Pokémon2," Every time your Pokémon fights in a battle, even if it’s only for a single turn, it will gain EV points from that battle. Because of this, you will want to be very careful about using your Pokémon in battles until they have maxed out their EVs. Only bring out your EV training Pokémon when you encounter a beneficial battle.


Each type of Pokémon will give your Pokémon different EV points when they battle. Know which Pokémon give which EV points and only fight if those are EV points that you want.

, In the early stages of EV training, your Pokémon may not be able to defeat the Pokémon it needs to in order to gain the EV points you want. You can deal with this in a few ways. One way is to get an Exp. Share, which when held by a Pokémon will give it the experience and EVs from a battle even if it does not fight. Another trick is to use the Pokémon in only one round and then switch it for another, stronger Pokémon.

, Some Pokémon give only 1 EV point when they are battled, while some give 3 points!If you want to EV train your Pokémon quickly, try to have them battle the Pokémon who give the most points in the stat you are trying to improve.


For example, fighting a Nidoqueen gives 3 EV points to HP, while fighting a Machamp gives 3 EV points to Attack.
Keep in mind, however, that while some Pokémon may give a high number of EV points in a particular stat, those Pokémon may be hard to find. You may be better off fighting Pokémon which are easy to encounter but still give at least a point or two in the stat (or stats) you want.

Use vitamins.,
Use items.,
Try to contract Pokérus.,
Find and use wings.,
Use items from Join Avenue.,
Use Rare Candies to level your Pokémon.",How to EV Train Your Pokémon3," Vitamins will give your Pokémon 10 EV points in a particular stat. You can give your Pokémon up to 10 vitamins, meaning that this is a fast way to get 100 EV points (out of the limit of 510 EV points). Vitamins cost $9,800 each.


You can buy Vitamins from Shopping Mall 9 in Black and White.

, There are a variety of items that you can equip on your Pokémon to make them gain EV points faster. The best item is the Macho Brace, which doubles all EV points gained but cuts your Pokémon’s speed. Other items, like a Power Weight or a Power Belt, only double a single stat but still cut the speed.

, Pokérus is a Pokémon virus. Though rare, Pokérus is a status affliction that cannot be cured via Pokémon Center. Although it is possible to battle a Pokémon with Pokérus (which can only be received by said method by battling with a Pokémon and not by running), you will most likely have better luck receiving one over trade. Much like a regular virus, once one of your Pokémon catches the virus, it can spread to your other Pokémon. This virus will double the EVs you get from battles and works with the other items which increase EVs gained. However, your Pokémon will only have it for a certain period of time and then they will heal, usually around a day after contracting Pokérus.Find out if your Pokémon has Pokérus by checking their status effects. You'll also be told by the nurse at a Pokémon Center if your Pokémon has Pokérus.
Keep in mind that this virus is very rare. You may never encounter it.

, Wings are items which can occasionally be found on Marvellous Bridge and Driftveil Drawbridge. These increase a given stat by 1 EV point. While these give less points than vitamins, they don’t have a limit, so you can use as many as you want (assuming you can find them).


The major downside it that the wings only increase 1 stat and which wing you find is random. It is also time consuming to find the wings.

, Join Avenue will have a number of items available for sale which can raise your EVs. Try the items at the Dojo or Cafe to make your EVs rise as much as 48 points. Be aware, however, that this can be very expensive. Secret Dish A, for example, which raises your HP EVs by 48 points costs $72000!, Since your EV Trained Pokémon will only see so many battles, you will need to have an alternative way to level it. The best way to do this is to use Rare Candies. These raise your Pokémon 1 level. They cost $4800 and are found in a lot of different places, depending on which game you are playing.

"
"
Be careful about resetting your EVs.,
Use berries.,
Use items from Join Avenue.",How to EV Train Your Pokémon4," Each Pokémon can only have 510 EV points. Only 252 of those points can be in any one stat. You may want to reset your EVs, say, if you accidentally used your Pokémon in a battle or if you decided to EV train a Pokémon after you had had it for a little while and it had seen a few battles. However, you will want to avoid items which might lower your EVs if you do not want them lowered.

, If you are playing Black or White, you can use Berries to lower your EVs. They are pretty much the opposite of vitamins in that they reduce a given EV number by 10. However, in Black and White, the Berries can only be found and grown in the Dream World., Join Avenue will have a number of items available for sale which can lower your EVs. Your best bet for items which lower EVs will come from the Beauty Salon, as these will very effectively lower EVs."

Identify Azurill’s weakness.,
Identify Azurill’s strengths.,
Battle low-level Pokémon.,
Increase the Friendship level of Azurill.",How to Evolve Azurill," While it’s evolve forms are water type, Azurill is a Normal Fairy–type Pokémon and is weak against Poison-types (like Koffing and Ekans) and Steel-types (Steelix and Skarmory). Avoid battling these types of Pokémon using Azurill.;
, On the other hand, Azurill has strong resistance against Dragon-types (Dratini and Dragonair) and Ghost-types (Ghastly and Misdreavus). Azurill will take little to no damage when attacked by these types of Pokémon.

, Azurill is the baby and first form of a 3-stage evolution, so don’t pit Azurill against high-level Pokémon.

, Friendship level measures how attached the Pokémon is to its trainer. You can increase Friendship by using held items like a Soothe Bell, which makes the Pokémon holding it friendly.


Most Pokémon evolve when their Friendship level reaches 220.

Find a player to trade with.,
Go inside a Union Room.,
Begin trading.,
Begin another trading sequence.",How to Evolve Boldore," Unlike other Pokémon that evolve by leveling up or using stones, Boldore only evolves when it gets traded to other players. Find a player either in your local area or online that you can trade Pokémon with.;
, This is where you'll meet the player your trading with.

, Select Boldore. Once the other player receives it, Boldore will evolve to Gigalith.

, You will need to do this to get Gigalith back.


To shorten the process, you can look for a player who’s willing to let go of a Boldore. Once you get their Boldore, it will evolve to Gigalith.

Know what Pokémon types Charmeleon is weak against.,
Know what Pokémon types Charmeleon is most effective against.,
Level Charmeleon up.,
Use Rare Candies.,
Do not use Fire Stones.",How to Evolve Charmeleon," This is very important when you’re trying to evolve Charmeleon. As a Fire-type Pokémon, it is weak against Ground and Rock-types, such as Onix and Dugtrio, and Water-types, like Squirtle and Gyarados. Charmeleon will take twice the damage from these types as it normally gets from other types.


If you use Charmeleon against these Pokémon, you’ll have a hard time winning, thus reducing the experience points (XP) you can gain for every battle.;
, Fire attacks are very effective against Grass-, Ice-, Bug-, and Steel-type Pokémon, inflicting twice the normal damage.


Battles with these types will be easier, and you can defeat higher level Pokémon, therefore gaining more XP for every battle.

, Once you know how to use Charmeleon against other Pokémon, you need to make it level up. Fight as many battles as you can to gain XP faster.


Charmeleon evolves into the all-powerful Charizard when it reaches level 36.

, If you don’t want to do Pokémon battles, you can always use Rare Candies to increase its level. Rare Candies are in-game items that increases your Pokémon’s level by 1 point instantly.


You can get Rare Candies by completing missions or from inside Battle Towers (available only for the newer versions of the game).

, Because Charmeleon evolves from Charmander, using Fire Stones won’t have any effect on it because stones can’t be used to forcibly evolve a starter Pokémon.

Avoid using Binacle against Pokémon types.,
Battle Pokémon types that Binacle will take less damage from.",How to Evolve Binacle1," As a Rock-type, it is weak against grass, Fighting and Ground-type Pokémon. The other half - water - also makes it weak against electric types.;
, Binacle is not immune to a particular type of attack but will take half damage from types such as Normal, Flying, Poison, Fire, and Ice.

"
"
Avoid certain types of Pokémon.,
Battle other elemental-type Pokémon.,
Make Axew reach level 38.",How to Evolve an Axew," You should try not to fight ice, fairy, and other similar dragon-type Pokémon. Since Axew is a dragon-type Pokémon, it is generally weak against the latter Pokémon. It will take twice the damage it would normally get from other types.;
, You'll want to battle fire, grass, water, and electric types, for example. Axew is not immune to a particular type of Pokémon but will hold much better against these types.

, In the game, Axew evolves into Fraxure starting at level 38. There are no stones you can use to force Axew’s evolution. Your only way to make it evolve is by allowing it to gain experience through Pokémon battles.

"
"
Level Binacle up.,
Use Rare Candies.",How to Evolve Binacle2," When it reaches level 39, Binacle will evolve to its adult form, Barbaracle. Gain as much XP as possible by doing Pokémon battles.

, You can increase Binacle’s level until it reaches level 38 (and evolves) by using Rare Candies. These items, when used, increases the Pokémon’s level by one point.
